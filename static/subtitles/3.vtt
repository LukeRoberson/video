WEBVTT

00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:10.259
Greetings. We are so happy that you could join us for the December JW Broadcasting Program.

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:16.260
We are confident that the next hour will be spiritually refreshing for all of us.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.260
Brother Mark Numera is joining us today. Mark, what do we have coming up on the program?

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.260
We're certainly looking forward to what you have to say, Brother Splain.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.260
In addition to that, you will meet a brother who went from being a criminal

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.259
to being a special agent for the government. He is now a long-time witness of Jehovah.

00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:40.259
What changed his life? Stay tuned to this channel.

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:46.259
If a person is of little means, does this necessarily rob him of the joy of giving?

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:50.259
We will have a video you will want to see and apply to your circumstances.

00:00:50.259 --> 00:01:19.469
How many of you have been to Germany? Join us on a trip there to visit one of the largest branches of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:23.469
If you have seen our broadcast of the annual meeting that was held last October,

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:27.469
you're aware of the fact that our songbook is being revised.

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:31.469
Well, perhaps some of you missed that broadcast.

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:37.469
So you may be wondering, why is it necessary to make changes to the songbook?

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:43.469
Well, as we explained at the annual meeting, some of the expressions used in our current songbook

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:47.469
were drawn from the earlier edition of the New World Translation.

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:51.469
That translation has been revised, as you know.

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:59.469
Instead of the desirable things of the nations, we now say the precious things of the nations.

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:03.469
Instead of loving kindness, we use loyal love.

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:07.469
Long suffering is rendered patience and so forth.

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.469
Since some of the terminology used in the songbook had to be adjusted,

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:19.469
the governing body decided to add a few songs as well, and we are very happy for that.

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:25.469
Now, those in attendance at the annual meeting this year were invited to sing three new songs.

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:33.469
And one of them was composed specially to mark the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the kingdom.

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:37.469
If you weren't present at the annual meeting this year, don't worry.

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:41.469
You'll get your chance to learn the new songs, and soon.

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:45.469
And you won't have to wait until the new songbook is released either.

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:51.469
From time to time, new songs will be released on our website for you to download.

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:59.469
Not only that, but at times we will even conclude the service meeting by singing one of the new songs.

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:01.469
Case in point.

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:09.469
During the week of January 5th, an entire service meeting has been set aside to help us appreciate our kingdom songs.

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:13.469
One of the new songs will be sung on that occasion.

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:19.469
It's entitled The Kingdom is in place. Let it come.

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:25.469
You guessed it, that's the song that was composed to mark the kingdom's 100th anniversary.

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:29.469
Would you like to hear it? Please listen and watch.

00:03:29.469 --> 00:04:03.090
You've given the throne to your son. He rules by your decree.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:50.740
One to destroy, see and see.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:05:28.740
What a majestic song of praise to Jehovah. Isn't that beautiful?

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.740
But how can we prepare to sing that song as well as the others that will follow?

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:40.740
Thank you now to our studios in Patterson, New York, where our music choral arrangements are produced.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:48.740
We'd like to introduce you to brothers Ted Adams and Danny Baker, who have worked with our orchestra for years.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.740
And we also have with us Chris and Susan Maver, who both have a background in music.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:00.740
Ted, we're counting on you and your guests to help us prepare to sing the new songs.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:06.740
Thank you for the spleen. Singing is an important prominent feature of our worship.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.740
So we want to be able to face the challenges of singing in a congregation setting.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.740
There's a special challenge when we're learning a new song. What is that?

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.740
I think learning a new song is like breaking in a new pair of shoes.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:24.740
At first, the new songs aren't as comfortable as the ones that were used to singing.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:32.740
But after singing them for a while, exerting a little effort, well, these could become our most favorite songs to sing.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.740
Now, some of us have a hard time learning new songs.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.740
But we have to remember that these new songs were composed for a good reason.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.740
It's actually a scriptural reason, isn't it?

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:50.740
That's right. You know, throughout the scriptures, we often see an expression like this, sing to Jehovah a new song.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:58.740
And the Bible tells us why new songs were composed and sung and why we should learn new songs today and sing them.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.740
The 98th song in verse 1 gives us a good reason.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:10.740
It says, sing to Jehovah a new song for he has done wonderful things.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.740
Now, we think about what Jehovah is doing today with his organization.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:22.740
Truly wonderful things he's accomplishing to glorify his name and to help his servants here on earth.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:28.740
And each of us in our personal lives have experienced Jehovah's wonderful things in our lives personally.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:40.740
Now, the new songs also reflect a clear understanding of the Bible, as well as expressing the love that we have for Jehovah and our appreciation for his tender care.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:46.740
So when we get these new songs, we can think about what Jehovah has done for us personally, that's true.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.740
But also, especially what he's doing with the organization now.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.740
This should put us on the right frame of mind and heart to really learn the songs.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:08:02.740
But what if we feel that we're just not as good as the singers on the recordings?

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:12.740
Well, actually, the singers on the recordings, some might be interested to know, very few of those used for vocal renditions have had any professional training or professional experience.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:18.740
So all of them have had to learn to sing better mainly through practice.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.740
And that's comforting for the rest of us.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:24.740
We feel like we may not sing so well, but we all can improve.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.740
We all can learn to sing better.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.740
And of course, the more you sing, the easier it will become.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:35.740
Some of us hesitate to sing because we feel the notes are a bit too high for us.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:41.740
Would you give us some ideas how we can change the range of our voice and be able to sing these higher notes?

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.740
Well, you know, for young people, the range is not a problem.

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:53.740
But as we age, unfortunately, like the rest of our bodies, our voices can lose range, like we lose range of motion.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:09:03.740
So we can regain some of our range by doing a type of stretching with our voice just as an athlete would stretch before a game or before going for a run.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:11.740
We can do that very simply by using like a humming sound, maybe in the shower, the kitchen, the car, somewhere you feel comfortable.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:20.740
And just using a humming sound to gently go through your full range of your voice and then gently pushing the limits of it.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:24.740
That way we can regain and maintain the range of our voice.

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.740
So that helps us with the range, but now what about those high notes?

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.740
Well, those high notes can be a bit of a challenge.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:34.740
But you know, there are a couple of things we can do that will really make them easier to produce.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:40.740
One is we need to make sure we take a really good breath before we sing the phrase with the high note in it.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:45.740
Because more breath energy makes it much easier to produce a higher note.

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:53.740
Also, physiologically, we need more space in the mouth and throat area to make it easier to produce a high note.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:10:06.870
So we would even see that on the outside when the mouth gets larger going from a lower note to a higher note.

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:10.870
Then it won't feel so tight and it's easier to produce a higher note.

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:17.870
Good. So those two things are take a deeper, bigger breath for the high notes and then more space created by the mouth.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:22.870
When how does the composing team help us with some of these high note issues?

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:30.870
Well, the composers do take the musical range of the human voice into account, including the range of unskilled singers.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:38.870
And in a musical composition, in dealing with high notes in particular, there's basically two ways to get up there as a composer.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:44.870
One is to walk your way up there, going up the scale. That's the easier method.

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:47.870
And locally, that's easier to get up there.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:51.870
At times in a composition, there are jumps from low notes to high notes.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:11:01.870
But there are jumps which are more logical musically, which also makes them more instinctively comfortable for us to sing, even if we're not trained singers.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:05.870
So the compositions have taken these factors into account.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:12.870
And I think two keys here, number one, what Susan has been talking about is to try and develop our voices a little more.

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:15.870
Couple that with learning the song.

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:21.870
And if you have those two things in place, high notes are not the issue that maybe you thought they would be.

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:30.279
You know, it sounds like the fundamentals for good singing are basically the same for good public speaking.

00:11:30.279 --> 00:11:33.279
Like the instructions we get in the Ministry School textbook.

00:11:33.279 --> 00:11:41.279
Exactly. You know, maintaining good posture, standing up nice and straight, and being sure to take good deep breaths before speaking.

00:11:41.279 --> 00:11:47.279
It's very true that poor posture and shallow breathing are definitely the enemies of good singing.

00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:51.279
It's just the way that Jehovah created us physiologically.

00:11:51.279 --> 00:11:54.279
We have these tiny little vocal cords.

00:11:54.279 --> 00:11:59.279
But when we take a good breath and send the air through them, then it resonates through our bones and tissues.

00:11:59.279 --> 00:12:02.279
And we can produce sound easily.

00:12:02.279 --> 00:12:04.279
Good. Thanks Susan. Good ideas on technique.

00:12:04.279 --> 00:12:07.279
Now here's the problem that comes up during our meetings.

00:12:07.279 --> 00:12:10.279
Sometimes the piano can't be heard.

00:12:10.279 --> 00:12:13.279
The volume of the piano is not high enough.

00:12:13.279 --> 00:12:18.279
And when you fill the auditorium with voices, it just drowns the piano out.

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:20.279
Now how can we handle that?

00:12:20.279 --> 00:12:27.279
Well, the key to solving that problem is for the brother at the sound console to be listening.

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:34.279
Listening not just to the piano volume, but listening also to what you refer to, how the singing is going.

00:12:34.279 --> 00:12:48.279
For example, if the singers can't stay together, or if they can't stay with the piano recording, they're either ahead of it or behind it, then that's the key for the sound operator to turn the piano up.

00:12:48.279 --> 00:12:54.279
So the operator then has to be free to focus on the sound.

00:12:54.279 --> 00:13:00.279
Just as when you're driving a car, you have to keep your hand on the wheel, make adjustments to stay on the road.

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:04.279
Yes, I think free for that task is the key word there.

00:13:04.279 --> 00:13:16.279
The reality is that at the beginning of many of our meeting programs, the brother or brothers in our sound department are trying to multitask with various little things that happen right at the beginning of the program.

00:13:16.279 --> 00:13:29.279
And this, this issue of the piano volume sometimes just gets overlooked. So at least one person back there has to be dedicated exclusively at that moment to listening to and adjusting the piano volume.

00:13:29.279 --> 00:13:36.279
And this would be especially true whenever a new song is scheduled for a program.

00:13:36.279 --> 00:13:42.279
It's definitely we need to be listening to the cues or the music when it's being played.

00:13:42.279 --> 00:13:52.279
But you know, this doesn't relieve us of the personal responsibility that each of us have to become familiar with the music even ahead of time before going to the meeting.

00:13:52.279 --> 00:13:56.279
And that way we can be prepared to sing the songs when we arrive.

00:13:56.279 --> 00:13:59.279
The same way we prepare for other parts in the meeting. That's right.

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:07.279
Well, doesn't that just put us right in mind of family worship then because family worship is where so much meeting preparation is done typically.

00:14:07.279 --> 00:14:16.279
So include the music during family worship, get the songbook out, turn on the piano recording, sing along.

00:14:16.279 --> 00:14:22.279
Even better if we can play the piano or if you play guitar, do it live and sing to it live.

00:14:22.279 --> 00:14:26.279
The simplified chords up there in JW.org that we can download.

00:14:26.279 --> 00:14:33.279
But even for social occasions, social gatherings, we can sing the songs.

00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:39.279
The idea is prepare for this part of our worship with the congregation or even for our assemblies and conventions.

00:14:39.279 --> 00:14:50.279
Yeah, you know, the faithful slave has really given us the tools to be well prepared not on congregation meetings, but also at these events, the assemblies and conventions.

00:14:50.279 --> 00:14:54.279
Once ahead of time, the programs are posted on the website.

00:14:54.279 --> 00:14:58.279
And in those programs are the songs that will be sung at these events.

00:14:58.279 --> 00:15:11.279
And so we can be well prepared by downloading, as you mentioned, the piano music or the sheet music from JW.org and include that in our preparation for our these assemblies.

00:15:11.279 --> 00:15:15.279
And you mentioned downloading a number of things, but is that hard to do?

00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:17.279
Well, they've tried to make it as simple as possible.

00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:25.279
On the homepage is the publications tab. You click on that. It brings up a tab on the left side that says music.

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:28.279
You click on that and all the music products are right there.

00:15:28.279 --> 00:15:35.279
The MP3s for the vocal renditions, the piano accompaniment, orchestral arrangements.

00:15:35.279 --> 00:15:39.279
But there's also a tab for the songbook, sing to Jehovah.

00:15:39.279 --> 00:15:48.279
If you click on that, there's a PDF tab and that gives you all the sheet music that you need, including the simplified guitar chords.

00:15:48.279 --> 00:15:56.279
Well, you know, Ted, as simple as that sounds, we do understand that many still find navigating websites to be a challenging thing.

00:15:56.279 --> 00:16:04.279
And at the same time, we know that some of our brothers and sisters still don't own the equipment, the computer equipment, to do their own downloads.

00:16:04.279 --> 00:16:13.279
This is where the congregation, and in particular the elders and ministerial servants, can take the lead in helping everyone to have these materials.

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:25.279
Because as we help each other that way, especially the brothers taking the lead, then this really engenders a spirit of enthusiasm, interest in this feature of our worship.

00:16:25.279 --> 00:16:35.279
It seems like we have all the tools that we need then to learn the new songs and be well prepared to sing them at our congregation meetings with the help of the elders, even as brought out here.

00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:46.279
And it really is important to do that because some of the songs besides not knowing the melodies or the words, it also could be written in a particular style that maybe we're not used to singing in.

00:16:46.279 --> 00:16:56.279
And so when we are listened to the music ahead of time, then we can come better familiar, not just with the tune and the words, but also the style in which they are written.

00:16:56.279 --> 00:17:03.279
Well, Chris, because you mentioned musical style, this brings up another personal matter, I think, for many of us.

00:17:03.279 --> 00:17:06.279
And that's how we view music itself.

00:17:06.279 --> 00:17:16.279
The point here is that it's all too common in this world to just be the product of the entertainment industry with respect to our musical tastes.

00:17:16.279 --> 00:17:20.279
They're in the business of selling what you might call ear candy.

00:17:20.279 --> 00:17:24.279
What that means is that anything that just quickly catches the ear and catches on becomes popular.

00:17:24.279 --> 00:17:28.279
Well, that's a very marketable product and they make a lot of money selling it.

00:17:28.279 --> 00:17:33.279
Well, it's kind of like candy that we like to eat when we're children.

00:17:33.279 --> 00:17:39.279
And we still like it when we grow up too, but the point is when we're children, that's kind of all we want.

00:17:39.279 --> 00:17:48.279
Later on, we have to learn to appreciate and enjoy the foods that are really better for us and the ones that we really need.

00:17:48.279 --> 00:17:53.279
Well, the music that we use in our worship is kind of like that healthy food.

00:17:53.279 --> 00:18:01.279
We might not yet have the taste for it, but we need to develop it because it's there to nourish us spiritually.

00:18:01.279 --> 00:18:05.279
The governing body wants us all to sing praises to Jehovah.

00:18:05.279 --> 00:18:11.279
Just like back in King Jehoshite's time when the army was going out into battle, they were singing.

00:18:11.279 --> 00:18:16.279
And the scripture says they were joyfully singing praises to Jehovah.

00:18:16.279 --> 00:18:22.279
So we want to use all the tools that we have to learn the new songs and just start singing.

00:18:22.279 --> 00:18:26.279
You know, Ted, I couldn't help but thank the scriptural reference.

00:18:26.279 --> 00:18:33.279
It really indicates that those men were not at all timid about singing praises to Jehovah God.

00:18:33.279 --> 00:18:36.279
And really, that sets a pattern for us today.

00:18:36.279 --> 00:18:43.279
We should not feel shy or timid about singing at the Kingdom Hall or at any of our meetings praises to Jehovah God.

00:18:43.279 --> 00:18:53.279
And certainly we have the tools now to learn these new songs and to be just like those ancient Israelites singing praises to Jehovah with full heart and joy.

00:18:53.279 --> 00:19:04.279
What you just said, Chris, really helps to make the point that we should view our singing and worship as we view our prayers at that matter of being timid.

00:19:04.279 --> 00:19:10.279
Well, prayer is not always easy, even even private prayer is not always easy.

00:19:10.279 --> 00:19:17.279
Sometimes we're praying about something painful or difficult or something that's kind of confusing at the time.

00:19:17.279 --> 00:19:19.279
So we're struggling for the clear thought.

00:19:19.279 --> 00:19:24.279
We're struggling even for the words to use in the prayer, even though it's a private prayer.

00:19:24.279 --> 00:19:32.279
But we still manage to give that prayer to Jehovah because we love him and because we want to continue worshiping him.

00:19:32.279 --> 00:19:40.279
That's why even people with limited vocabularies can still pray very successfully, very effectively to Jehovah.

00:19:40.279 --> 00:19:44.279
And maybe that's the way some of us are as singers. We're limited.

00:19:44.279 --> 00:19:46.279
But that's okay.

00:19:46.279 --> 00:19:50.279
We still do it and we're not timid about it.

00:19:50.279 --> 00:19:56.279
We do it for the same important reasons that we love Jehovah and that we want to worship him this way.

00:19:56.279 --> 00:20:00.279
When we get the new songs, we want to be excited about learning them.

00:20:00.279 --> 00:20:05.279
These new songs express our devotion, our feeling for Jehovah.

00:20:05.279 --> 00:20:13.279
They also keep us in harmony with the greater understanding of scriptures and, of course, how Jehovah deals with us personally.

00:20:13.279 --> 00:20:17.589
Now we'll go back to our studio in Brooklyn.

00:20:17.589 --> 00:20:22.589
Thank you so much, panel. Your insights have been most helpful.

00:20:22.589 --> 00:20:30.589
We recommend that you viewers replay that discussion again before the service meeting for the week of January 5th.

00:20:30.589 --> 00:20:36.589
Well, music certainly can bring us joy. But Mark, what else contributes to our happiness?

00:20:36.589 --> 00:20:40.589
The Bible indicates that giving makes us happy.

00:20:40.589 --> 00:20:44.589
But some of our brothers have very little materially.

00:20:44.589 --> 00:20:48.589
How can we give to others if we are struggling economically?

00:20:48.589 --> 00:20:53.589
But likely we can all learn a lesson from this next video. Please watch.

00:20:53.589 --> 00:21:01.880
I love my family very much.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:07.880
Even though we don't have a lot, we're glad we have each other.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:18.680
Mom works really hard to provide for us. It's just the four of us.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:31.900
We've all been feeling just a little sad lately.

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:42.740
I can tell she's really tired and worries a lot.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:49.740
I try to help out. Sometimes I help to get everyone ready for the meeting.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:53.740
We seem to manage our right.

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:59.690
Things are really hard.

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:12.259
The elders could tell we were struggling.

00:22:12.259 --> 00:22:15.259
They came to visit us. They were so loving.

00:22:15.259 --> 00:22:38.940
Billy listened to Mom and read her some scriptures.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:43.940
They helped her to see that Jehovah still cared about all of us.

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:48.940
And that we still have the love of the congregation to strengthen us.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:59.420
I could tell Mom felt a lot better afterwards.

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:05.420
At our next family worship, Mom read to us 2 Corinthians 814.

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:13.420
That story is about the Macedonians. Mom had us close our eyes so we can imagine the scene.

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:21.420
Even though the Macedonians were very poor, they found happiness by giving what they could to others.

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:26.420
They even begged the apostles for the opportunity to give.

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:41.210
Then we read Acts 2035 where it says,

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:47.210
There is more happiness and giving than there is and receiving, like Sister said.

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:50.210
But we don't have anything to give.

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:53.210
Mom said, but we do. We have ourselves.

00:23:53.210 --> 00:24:01.660
It got us all thinking. Mom had a great idea.

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:24.140
We spent the rest of our family worship making special gifts for the friends and our congregation.

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:51.619
It was pretty amazing.

00:24:51.619 --> 00:24:57.619
Even though we don't have a lot materially, there is still so much we can give.

00:24:57.619 --> 00:25:03.619
Like putting a little in the contribution box each week and helping to clean.

00:25:03.619 --> 00:25:09.619
And of course sharing in the ministry is the very best way we can give to others.

00:25:09.619 --> 00:25:28.150
Now we are even closer as a family. And we have learned that there truly is more happiness and giving.

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:35.289
Even small gifts are appreciated by the recipient.

00:25:36.289 --> 00:25:42.289
You recall that Jesus commended the needy widow who dropped in only two small coins of very little value.

00:25:42.289 --> 00:25:48.289
He thus emphasized the point that all of us can contribute to something to Jehovah's work.

00:25:48.289 --> 00:25:51.289
Even if we are of little means.

00:25:51.289 --> 00:25:58.289
In fact, that video reminded me of the time when my wife and I spent time in East Africa as missionaries.

00:25:58.289 --> 00:26:07.289
We saw how some of our brothers in the rural areas, though limited financially, did not want to miss out on the privilege of giving.

00:26:07.289 --> 00:26:09.289
They yearned to give.

00:26:09.289 --> 00:26:17.289
Jesus example of the widow demonstrated that joyful giving is not limited to those who may have more materially.

00:26:17.289 --> 00:26:31.289
In fact, in one area I recall each member of a congregation willingly contributed one metal roof sheet or bag of maize toward the construction of a modest locally built kingdom hall.

00:26:31.289 --> 00:26:38.289
And they were so happy. They realized that there was more happiness in giving than in receiving.

00:26:39.289 --> 00:26:49.289
As pointed out in the video, another way of giving is by means of our work at the kingdom hall or other activities in Jehovah's service.

00:26:49.289 --> 00:26:57.289
An excellent example of one who gave of his time and energy is brother Max Larson.

00:26:57.289 --> 00:27:04.289
He served at World Headquarters for over 72 years until his death in 2011.

00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:10.289
He saw firsthand many exciting developments in our modern day history.

00:27:10.289 --> 00:27:23.339
In this archive interview, please observe how brother Larson trusted in Jehovah's direction.

00:27:23.339 --> 00:27:27.339
The photograph was a part of our work back at that time.

00:27:27.339 --> 00:27:32.339
Had records of the time made them material dissolved in the water.

00:27:32.339 --> 00:27:35.339
And out in Washington state, you get a lot of rain.

00:27:35.339 --> 00:27:38.339
And one drop on that record and the needle headed room to record.

00:27:38.339 --> 00:27:41.339
So we had to try to keep out of the rain.

00:27:41.339 --> 00:27:43.339
And then we started playing a record and started out.

00:27:43.339 --> 00:27:47.339
It's often said that religion is a snare and a racquet.

00:27:47.339 --> 00:27:49.339
That kind of people attention.

00:27:49.339 --> 00:27:56.339
It served very well for the final probation for carrying on the ministry working using every day.

00:27:56.339 --> 00:27:59.339
Especially when in the special pioneer work.

00:27:59.339 --> 00:28:01.339
That's 200 hours a month.

00:28:01.339 --> 00:28:02.339
It was pretty busy.

00:28:02.339 --> 00:28:05.339
I did that four months before I came to Bethel.

00:28:05.339 --> 00:28:07.339
And all that time, I used to photograph.

00:28:07.339 --> 00:28:17.509
Back in the Depression day, they did a lot of trading.

00:28:17.509 --> 00:28:22.509
So this day, I traded for books for a big bag of pairs.

00:28:22.509 --> 00:28:26.509
I gave them about 9.30, I stayed up in the attic, getting a ball in there for the...

00:28:26.509 --> 00:28:31.509
Al Hoffman was one of the noiner and he was the district overseer in that trailer.

00:28:31.509 --> 00:28:35.509
So I went over to him and asked him, like, to have some pairs.

00:28:35.509 --> 00:28:38.509
And he said, oh, my teacher, love, to have some pairs.

00:28:38.509 --> 00:28:39.509
He said, come on in.

00:28:39.509 --> 00:28:41.509
So he said, sit down.

00:28:41.509 --> 00:28:43.509
He said, you ever think about the Bible house?

00:28:43.509 --> 00:28:44.509
I said, what's that?

00:28:44.509 --> 00:28:45.509
That's what they call Bethel.

00:28:45.509 --> 00:28:47.509
At the time, he started explaining Bethel.

00:28:47.509 --> 00:28:49.509
We sat there seven and a half hours ago.

00:28:49.509 --> 00:28:51.509
It was so wonderful hearing about Bethel.

00:28:51.509 --> 00:28:53.509
I was so excited about it.

00:28:53.509 --> 00:28:55.509
So instead of going up and going to Bethel, I went up in my room,

00:28:55.509 --> 00:28:56.509
got my paper and pencil.

00:28:56.509 --> 00:28:58.509
I wrote a letter to the Society.

00:28:58.509 --> 00:29:00.509
He asked for a Bethel application.

00:29:00.509 --> 00:29:02.509
And then it would come back to Bethel.

00:29:02.509 --> 00:29:06.509
So I kept it in mind every day and prayers at Jehovah.

00:29:06.509 --> 00:29:08.509
And four months, I got my call.

00:29:08.509 --> 00:29:09.509
Very short letter.

00:29:09.509 --> 00:29:11.509
There are only a few lines.

00:29:11.509 --> 00:29:12.509
We have your application.

00:29:12.509 --> 00:29:13.509
You can come right away.

00:29:13.509 --> 00:29:14.509
We can use you.

00:29:14.509 --> 00:29:15.509
That's fun.

00:29:15.509 --> 00:29:18.509
So then those days, you didn't get on a plane and ride.

00:29:18.509 --> 00:29:20.509
You get on a bus.

00:29:20.509 --> 00:29:22.509
There were six days, six nights on a bus.

00:29:22.509 --> 00:29:25.509
In the wintertime, the Blizzard Month had a Blizzard North to go.

00:29:25.509 --> 00:29:30.200
And I finally got to New York.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:34.200
Well, first assignment, Brother North took me down to the shipping department.

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.200
So he had me tying cartons for a week.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.200
And then Brother North came down and took me up to the press room.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:43.200
And he said, we're getting a new press in three months.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.200
Elrott is going to run that.

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.200
Now, if you can learn to run this, you can operate it.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.200
So in three months, while it's operating,

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.200
operate it for a year and a half.

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:54.200
And then one day, Brother North came down again after a year and a half.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.200
And how did you like to work in the office?

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:59.200
Well, Brother North, that's the last job I would think.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:03.200
So then he started introducing me to the type of work I had to do.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.200
And then he's made a statement I never forgot and still using.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.200
If you want to spoil a manager and give him desk work,

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.200
a manager belongs with the people who aren't working,

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.200
then you go through this plant twice a day.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.200
So learn to do that.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:21.200
So then I did that for his assistant being trained for a year and a half.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.200
And then one night, everybody gone home.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.200
It's an open office.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.200
His desk was about 15 feet from mine.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:31.200
And he said, I just got a call.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.200
Papi just went home.

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.200
That was a call from San Ada Papi,

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.200
who was rather for the die.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:38.200
He didn't send him more for a minute to then produce the well.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:42.200
He says, in fact, I'll have to stay over 124 and take care of the world.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.200
You take the factory.

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.200
I didn't sleep too much that night.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:49.200
So I only had three years of Bethel experience.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:53.200
So then from then on, I had the factory job for 59 years.

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:58.700
When I got this assignment, not to be a factor of a seer,

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:02.700
but three years experience, I need a lot of help.

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.700
They were all very helpful, too.

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:07.700
There was nine departments of the factory,

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:10.700
and every department had an overseer, and every moment was years anointed.

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:13.700
I go them and talk over matters, discuss things.

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.700
The difference had different abilities and different fields.

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:18.700
If it was something on the Bible, I'd go to Brother Carl Klein.

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.700
He was sharp as biblical.

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:22.700
And now that's a different matter.

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:24.700
And that's what pulled me through.

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:27.700
I get to appreciate the depth of the anointed part of that.

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:31.700
None of them resented the fact that I got the job of them in a Bethel longer years.

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:33.700
And they're very devoted.

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:37.700
We had what we call a janitors back there.

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:38.700
They call them cleaners.

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:41.700
These two handled the factory for about 50 years,

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.700
doing all the janitors their work to the anointed.

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:47.700
And they just treasure that privilege they had.

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:51.700
They just showed their spirit they had to anointed people.

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:57.210
All of us said there's no place on earth.

00:31:57.210 --> 00:31:59.210
That equals being at Bethel.

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:01.210
And of course, I had that feeling.

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:03.210
Everyone savagely went out to the States to law.

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:05.210
I never thought of anything else.

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:08.210
I've had a good companion, a very intelligent,

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:11.210
a very spiritual-minded wife.

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:14.210
I've had to vote it.

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:18.210
And it's been a great encouragement to the two to help me state Bethel.

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:24.000
Also, those years, the operating of the factory constantly

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000
and I appreciate it, your host of reaction.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
I knew it's going to come out the way intended to.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000
To see that organization be built up.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
We're fulfilling what we've prayed for.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
For God's came to the comforter,

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
we'll be done on earth that doesn't happen.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
We live without sickness, without illness,

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000
perfection of health, peaceful conditions on earth,

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
a paradise condition.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
There's what our loving father has for us.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
And that's the hope we have.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
And that's what we strive for,

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
to be faithful to the hope of God,

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
that other people learn about this.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
We can take a great crowd with us through this tribulation.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Enjoy eternal life on a paradise earth,

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.109
on a loving rule of a heavenly government kingdom.

00:33:07.109 --> 00:33:10.109
If you have visited World Headquarters in New York,

00:33:10.109 --> 00:33:12.109
you might have recognized some of the places

00:33:12.109 --> 00:33:14.109
where Brother Larsen worked.

00:33:14.109 --> 00:33:17.109
However, ours is a global organization

00:33:17.109 --> 00:33:19.109
and much work takes place

00:33:19.109 --> 00:33:22.109
and our many branches around the world.

00:33:22.109 --> 00:33:25.109
Join us as we visit the Central York Branch,

00:33:25.109 --> 00:33:28.109
which is located in Salter's Germany.

00:33:28.109 --> 00:33:30.109
This is one of the larger branches used

00:33:30.109 --> 00:33:32.109
by Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:33:32.109 --> 00:33:35.109
The tour video demonstrates what is involved

00:33:35.109 --> 00:33:38.109
in providing spiritual food to people.

00:33:38.109 --> 00:34:08.320
Peace, the purity, your balance,

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:11.630
sending support, your overpromised,

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:16.900
grasping your right hand, saying to you,

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:18.900
do not be afraid.

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:20.900
I will help you.

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:23.900
He stretches out his hand to us every day

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:29.900
through magazines, books, films, videos.

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:33.900
They help us to live by his word.

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:36.900
All this is available to us

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.900
thanks to the cooperation of 90 branch offices

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:41.900
throughout the world.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:45.900
One of them is in Salters.

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:49.900
Over 30 persons translate the articles and videos

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:53.900
from English into German.

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:57.900
They are recorded and published on our website

00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:04.099
or are prepared for print.

00:35:04.099 --> 00:35:13.409
Large editions are produced at high speed.

00:35:13.409 --> 00:35:18.750
Advanced technology is used.

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:22.750
The entire process focuses on quality.

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:57.940
Literature for 1.3 million brothers

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:01.940
is sent from here in 300 languages.

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:34.239
Literature is packed for over 16,500 congregations.

00:36:34.239 --> 00:36:46.719
It is sent to all four corners of the earth.

00:36:46.719 --> 00:36:50.719
Even to the most eastern parts of Asia,

00:36:50.719 --> 00:36:58.530
a branch committee coordinate all Bethel operations.

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:01.530
These experienced men also look

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:04.530
after the preaching work throughout the branch territory.

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:11.239
Conventions are organized.

00:37:11.239 --> 00:37:21.179
The activity of circuit overseers is coordinated.

00:37:21.179 --> 00:37:26.360
Schools are also planned.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.360
The idea behind these schools

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:31.360
is for the graduates to lend a helping hand

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:37.760
to the congregations.

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:46.010
We loved the school.

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:49.010
It was a special training from Jehovah.

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:55.750
Concepts are developed and executed

00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:57.750
for the construction, extension

00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:01.750
and renovation of Bethel homes and assembly halls.

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:06.469
When we found the lightning,

00:38:06.469 --> 00:38:08.469
when we were assigned to do an assembly hall,

00:38:08.469 --> 00:38:10.469
we first looked for properties.

00:38:10.469 --> 00:38:13.469
It has to be large enough and well-located

00:38:13.469 --> 00:38:15.469
for the brothers to easily reach.

00:38:15.469 --> 00:38:17.469
We also look for sufficient parking space

00:38:17.469 --> 00:38:20.469
and good public transport.

00:38:20.469 --> 00:38:23.469
We usually have several properties to choose from.

00:38:23.469 --> 00:38:25.469
Then we work out different options

00:38:25.469 --> 00:38:27.469
and drawings for each site.

00:38:27.469 --> 00:38:29.469
After that, we send these options

00:38:29.469 --> 00:38:32.469
to the governing body for review and approval.

00:38:32.469 --> 00:38:41.519
For questions on non-blood medical management,

00:38:41.519 --> 00:38:46.519
600 brothers in 80 hospital liaison committees are available.

00:38:46.519 --> 00:38:49.519
The commitment of the brothers

00:38:49.519 --> 00:38:51.519
and the hospital liaison committees

00:38:51.519 --> 00:38:53.519
has always been amazing to me.

00:38:53.519 --> 00:38:55.519
Everything they do for their brothers

00:38:55.519 --> 00:38:58.519
is out of love and without payment.

00:38:58.519 --> 00:39:00.519
When we think of such a service,

00:39:00.519 --> 00:39:04.519
we clearly see Jehovah's Hand.

00:39:04.519 --> 00:39:11.519
At Bethel, all live together

00:39:11.519 --> 00:39:22.940
like a big family.

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:30.940
Of course, the spiritual program is very important.

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:35.940
We enjoy the well-prepared comments that morning worship.

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:37.940
And then, of course,

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:40.940
we look forward to watch our study on Monday evening

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:42.940
when the Bethel family comes together

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:51.380
to study gods who are out to study.

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:55.380
All the work accomplished here is not just any kind of work,

00:39:55.380 --> 00:40:09.489
false loving devotion.

00:40:09.489 --> 00:40:17.820
It is sacred service,

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:26.269
no matter where one comes from,

00:40:26.269 --> 00:40:29.269
no matter what the assignment,

00:40:29.269 --> 00:40:46.690
the common goal is to promote the worldwide work

00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:59.179
to honor Jehovah.

00:40:59.179 --> 00:41:05.010
Jehovah helps us to remain strong in the faith,

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:12.739
to reach out for his hand,

00:41:12.739 --> 00:41:18.340
toward a bright future.

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:21.340
If you enjoyed that glimpse of the work in a foreign country,

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:24.340
you'll be happy to know that on the

00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:27.340
Our Activities channel on JW Broadcasting,

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:31.340
you will find tour videos from additional branches.

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:34.340
Seeing how our brothers and sisters worldwide work together

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:40.579
in unity will strengthen your faith.

00:41:40.579 --> 00:41:42.579
In this self-centered world,

00:41:42.579 --> 00:41:46.579
Satan takes every opportunity to attack Jehovah's people.

00:41:46.579 --> 00:41:48.579
Whether we have served faithfully for many years

00:41:48.579 --> 00:41:51.579
or have only recently embraced the truth,

00:41:51.579 --> 00:41:54.579
it is vital that we stay close to Jehovah

00:41:54.579 --> 00:41:57.579
and his organization.

00:41:57.579 --> 00:41:59.579
In the following morning worship program,

00:41:59.579 --> 00:42:02.579
Brother Stephen Let, a member of the governing body

00:42:02.579 --> 00:42:05.579
reminds us why we need to protect ourselves

00:42:05.579 --> 00:42:08.579
from overconfidence.

00:42:08.579 --> 00:42:10.579
If you look at today's text,

00:42:10.579 --> 00:42:13.579
let him that thinks he is standing beware

00:42:13.579 --> 00:42:16.579
that he doesn't not fall.

00:42:16.579 --> 00:42:19.579
What is that especially warning against?

00:42:19.579 --> 00:42:22.579
Is it not overconfidence?

00:42:22.579 --> 00:42:25.579
What could cause a pilot to neglect

00:42:25.579 --> 00:42:28.579
to carefully follow his safety checklist before takeoff?

00:42:28.579 --> 00:42:30.579
Again, overconfidence.

00:42:30.579 --> 00:42:34.579
What could cause a Christian to fail to regularly check

00:42:34.579 --> 00:42:36.579
the depth of his spirituality?

00:42:36.579 --> 00:42:38.579
Again, overconfidence.

00:42:38.579 --> 00:42:40.579
So, this being said,

00:42:40.579 --> 00:42:42.579
let's discuss the theme,

00:42:42.579 --> 00:42:45.579
never become overconfident.

00:42:45.579 --> 00:42:48.579
Now, even though there's no age restriction,

00:42:48.579 --> 00:42:51.579
especially young ones need to beware

00:42:51.579 --> 00:42:53.579
of the snare of overconfidence.

00:42:53.579 --> 00:42:56.579
Now, you can see this tendency of younger ones

00:42:56.579 --> 00:42:59.579
to be overconfident in how some of them

00:42:59.579 --> 00:43:03.579
will recklessly maneuver a motorcycle

00:43:03.579 --> 00:43:06.579
at very high speed through heavy traffic,

00:43:06.579 --> 00:43:09.579
feeling they're invincible.

00:43:09.579 --> 00:43:11.579
You can almost tell how old they are

00:43:11.579 --> 00:43:15.579
about how fast they go through the traffic there.

00:43:15.579 --> 00:43:19.579
Open up, please, to Proverbs chapter 14.

00:43:19.579 --> 00:43:22.579
And even though this scripture doesn't put

00:43:22.579 --> 00:43:24.579
any age restriction,

00:43:24.579 --> 00:43:26.579
the point being made

00:43:26.579 --> 00:43:29.579
that nobody can overconfidently

00:43:29.579 --> 00:43:32.579
think he's immune to overconfidence.

00:43:32.579 --> 00:43:34.579
Now, you have to think about that statement.

00:43:34.579 --> 00:43:37.980
Look at Proverbs 14,

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:39.980
but young ones especially have to beware,

00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:42.980
but there's no age restriction here.

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:44.980
Verse 16,

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:47.980
the wise one is cautious

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:49.980
and turns away from evil.

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:53.980
But the stupid one is reckless

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:56.980
and overconfident.

00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:58.980
So, obviously, we don't want to be

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:01.980
in the camp of the stupid one, do we?

00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:04.980
That one is reckless and overconfident.

00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:06.980
We want to be cautious

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:08.980
and turn away from evil.

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:10.980
Now, using this scripture as a foundation

00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:13.980
for our discussion, what are some cautions?

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:14.980
Because you know what it says,

00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:16.980
the wise one is cautious?

00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:18.980
What are some cautions that can help us

00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:21.980
from being, or keep us from being overconfident?

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:23.980
Well, let's quickly discuss three.

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:27.980
One, never overconfidently think

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:31.980
we can take unauthorized liberties.

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.980
Now, let's just talk about this for a moment.

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:36.980
Here's two contrasting examples.

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:38.980
Think of Aza.

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:41.980
Now, no one knows to touch the arc of the covenant,

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:43.980
but he reached out

00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:45.980
and grabbed hold of it, didn't he?

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:47.980
Well, Jehovah struck him dead

00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:51.980
for this unauthorized liberty that he took.

00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:53.980
In contrast, think about David.

00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:56.980
Now, David, even though he had a perfect opportunity

00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:58.980
to kill Saul,

00:44:58.980 --> 00:45:01.980
his men were encouraging him to do it,

00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:06.980
he refused to touch the anointed of Jehovah.

00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:09.980
He even felt bad that he had disrespectfully touched

00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:12.980
the garments of the anointed of Jehovah.

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:16.980
So he knew he had not been authorized to kill Saul.

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:19.980
So he stayed in his place, he waited on Jehovah.

00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:21.980
And what a fine example for us.

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:23.980
And I'm sure we can all think of,

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:25.980
in regard to this first caution,

00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:28.980
we can think of application for here at Bethel

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:32.980
in our congregation, even in our family.

00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:34.980
Let's get our second caution.

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:40.980
Never overconfidently presume on Jehovah's mercy.

00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:42.980
Now, let's think about this.

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:46.980
An example of this could be ones that think

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:49.980
they'll leave the truth for a while.

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:52.980
They'll have some fun in this world.

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:56.980
They'll enjoy some selfish desires

00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:58.980
and then they'll come back later to Jehovah.

00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:01.980
And Jehovah will take them back to Jehovah will forgive them.

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:03.980
But now, isn't that very risky?

00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:06.980
Isn't that a reckless course?

00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:10.980
In fact, it makes me think of the story of the dog

00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:14.980
we had on the farm when I was about 11 or 12 years old.

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:15.980
He was a good dog.

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:17.980
We loved him. His name was Wheeler.

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:19.980
But one night,

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:22.980
there was a pack of wild dogs that came through the valley

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:23.980
where we lived.

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:28.980
And Wheeler took off with these wild dogs.

00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:29.980
Now, we couldn't understand it

00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:31.980
because we took such good care of him.

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:32.980
I asked Dad, why?

00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:34.980
Why would he do that?

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:35.980
Well, my father said,

00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:38.980
maybe there's a female in the pack.

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:40.980
Maybe he just wants to have fun for a while,

00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:42.980
but I'm pretty sure he'll come home.

00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:45.980
Well, he did come home about a week later.

00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:46.980
But he was all chewed up.

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:48.980
He had been in a horrible fight

00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:51.980
with one or more of the other dogs apparently in the pack.

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:54.980
And he barely made it back to his doghouse.

00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:56.980
It took him a couple of weeks.

00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:57.980
He slowly recovered.

00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:00.980
He never had this same strength that he had previously.

00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:02.980
But now, here's a really sad part of the story.

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:03.980
About two years later,

00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:06.980
another pack of wild dogs came through.

00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:09.980
And again, he ran off with them.

00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:11.980
Now, we couldn't believe it.

00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:13.980
This time, he came back,

00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:15.980
even he was gone longer.

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:18.980
And he couldn't even make it back this time to the doghouse.

00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:20.980
We found him the next morning in the yard

00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:25.980
and my brother and I gently carried him to his doghouse

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:29.980
and about a day later he died in that doghouse.

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:30.980
Now, we cried.

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:31.980
We couldn't believe it.

00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:33.980
Now, he was just a dog.

00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:35.980
But if you think about that story,

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:38.980
some of our young ones really remind you

00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:41.980
of that dog, Wheeler.

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:44.980
They're so well cared for by those that love them,

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:45.980
especially Jehovah,

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:48.980
but they think they're missing out on fun.

00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:51.980
And so they will run with the world for a while,

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:53.980
thinking probably in the back of their head,

00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:55.980
they're going to come back to the truth later.

00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:57.980
But how foolish, how recklessly

00:47:57.980 --> 00:48:00.980
may none of us even slightly think this way

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:01.980
and may we help others,

00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:03.980
and especially our young ones,

00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:06.980
to never foolishly reason this way.

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:09.980
But one more caution, a third,

00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:13.980
never overconfidently rely on ourselves.

00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:16.980
Solomon, apparently, that was his downfall.

00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:21.980
He knew he was not to increase the number of horses,

00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:23.980
increase wives.

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:25.980
See, he was not ignorant.

00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:28.980
He knew, but somehow he must have rationalized.

00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:29.980
He was an exception.

00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:30.980
See, he was strong enough.

00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:31.980
He was wise enough.

00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:32.980
He could handle it.

00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:36.980
Well, that was the pride before the crash, wasn't it?

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:37.980
Or what about Peter?

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:39.980
Apparently his downfall.

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:41.980
In effect, he said,

00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:43.980
all the others may have weaknesses in their faith,

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:45.980
but not me, Lord.

00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:47.980
I'll never fail you.

00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:50.980
But this overconfident, self-reliant,

00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:52.980
I am more faithful than they are attitude,

00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:55.980
was followed by a terrible crash.

00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:58.980
And that makes us think of Paul's words

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:00.980
at 2 Corinthians 1210,

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:02.980
when I am weak,

00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:03.980
then I am powerful.

00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:04.980
See, when we're weak,

00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:06.980
we know we have to depend on Jehovah.

00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:08.980
That's really when we're the strongest.

00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:11.980
But when we think we're strong, like Peter,

00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:14.980
that's generally when we're relying on ourselves.

00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:16.980
And that's when we're the weakest.

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:20.980
In contrast to Peter, Solomon, Jesus,

00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:23.980
never overconfidently relied on himself.

00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:25.980
And that's why he never crashed.

00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:28.980
But look at Luke chapter 22.

00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:33.980
Just one more thought here about right before his betrayal

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:35.980
and death.

00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:39.980
See, notice how he was certainly not relying on himself,

00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:41.980
even though you could say he had billions of years

00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:44.980
of faithful service under his belt.

00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:46.980
Verse 41,

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:49.980
He withdrew from them about a stone's throw away.

00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:53.980
He bent his knees and began to pray, saying,

00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:56.980
Father, if you want to,

00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:58.980
remove this cup from me.

00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:00.980
Nevertheless, let not my will,

00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:02.980
but yours take place.

00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:04.980
Then an angel from heaven appeared to him

00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:06.980
and strengthened him.

00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:09.980
But he was in such agony that he kept praying

00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:11.980
more earnestly,

00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:15.980
and his sweat became as drops of blood falling to the ground.

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:17.980
Now just recently, I noticed that,

00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:19.980
and thought about this point,

00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:22.980
that even after the angel strengthened him,

00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:24.980
he didn't say, well, I've been strengthened.

00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:26.980
Now I'm good to go.

00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:29.980
No, he prayed even more intently.

00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:33.980
Truly the opposite of overconfidence.

00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:35.980
So there we have three cautions.

00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:38.980
Never overconfidently think we can take unauthorized

00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:42.980
liberties in Jehovah's organization.

00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:46.980
Number two, never overconfidently presume

00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:49.980
on Jehovah's mercy.

00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:54.980
And number three, never overconfidently rely on ourselves.

00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:56.980
Now if we observe these cautions,

00:50:56.980 --> 00:51:01.980
we'll never join the camp of the stupid ones

00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:05.980
who are reckless and overconfident.

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:07.980
What a privilege it was to hear Brother Lett,

00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:11.980
a member of the governing body at Morning Worship.

00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:13.980
Have you ever asked fellow believers

00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:15.980
how they found the truth?

00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:17.980
It is a common question that sometimes

00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:20.980
uncovers unique experiences.

00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:23.980
We asked Brother James Dyson that question.

00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:26.980
As a young man, he was overconfident,

00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:28.980
but he reached a turning point.

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:29.980
What was it?

00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:31.980
And where has it led him?

00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:34.980
Please listen to his intriguing story.

00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:41.860
I came from a rather large family.

00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:44.860
We went to church from our youth on.

00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:47.860
I guess I really stopped going to church

00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:49.860
when I was a teenager.

00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:53.860
I graduated from high school in 1965.

00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:57.860
Since the Vietnam War was raging,

00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:00.860
I knew I would have to make a decision.

00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:02.860
I didn't want to fight in Vietnam

00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:05.860
because I didn't want to get killed first of all.

00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:08.860
And I didn't really want to be put in a position

00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:10.860
where I might have to kill someone else.

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:13.860
And so I decided that the best thing for me to do,

00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:16.860
instead of trying to dodge the draft,

00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:19.860
was to join a form of the military,

00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:21.860
where I wouldn't have to fight.

00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:23.860
I worked on airplanes.

00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:25.860
Every night was an adventure.

00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:27.860
You know, when you're off base,

00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:29.860
you're either downtown with the black market,

00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:32.860
the clubs, buying and selling drugs.

00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:34.860
It was just a wild scene.

00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:37.860
After my military service was over

00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:39.860
and I was honestly discharged,

00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:41.860
I went to one of the old clubs

00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:43.860
that everybody used to go to.

00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:45.860
And to my surprise,

00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:48.860
one of the guys that I worked with

00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:50.860
and the Air Force was there.

00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:52.860
We got to talking.

00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:54.860
And right there,

00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:58.860
that very night, we devised this plan to go to Thailand.

00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:00.860
And I got some drugs.

00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:02.860
Two months later, that's what we did.

00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:03.860
Just to get there,

00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:05.860
we had to go through a channel

00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:08.860
of waterways through the jungle.

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:11.860
When we got to this one little island

00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:15.860
where this drug lord was,

00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:16.860
we picked up the drugs.

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:18.860
And when we got to the airport,

00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:20.860
this Thai colonel

00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:22.860
and the police force,

00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:25.860
he put a 38 right here

00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:26.860
and he told me,

00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:29.860
please do not try to resist me.

00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:31.860
So from there, of course,

00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:33.860
we went to our jail,

00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:34.860
Clung Prim Prison,

00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:36.860
right there in Thailand.

00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:39.860
Life in Clung Prim was pretty grim.

00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:42.860
And so you only got fear twice a day.

00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:44.860
They wouldn't serve it to us.

00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:47.860
They would put it out in the middle of the yard.

00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:51.860
And you had to run for it.

00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:53.860
Awful.

00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:54.860
Two months.

00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:57.860
I lost 130 pounds.

00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:00.860
And so I had to fight.

00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:02.860
It was crazy.

00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:06.860
We had this British gentleman

00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:08.860
come to visit us

00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:10.860
while we were in prison.

00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:12.860
And he told us that

00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:15.860
he was from the American consulate

00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:17.860
and that he wanted to help us.

00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:19.860
And he said, let me tell you something.

00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:20.860
You're in a lot of trouble.

00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:22.860
So as it turned out,

00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:26.860
this man was the chief narcotics agent

00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:29.860
for the whole Southeast Asian area.

00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:31.860
And he said, I want you to work for me

00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:33.860
as a special agent.

00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:36.860
And so I told him, okay, you know, I'll try it.

00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:38.860
And then back to Okinawa.

00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:43.179
And that's where I started to work as an agent.

00:54:43.179 --> 00:54:45.179
He said, you're not going to get paid.

00:54:45.179 --> 00:54:48.179
You know, you're going to have to deal drugs to survive.

00:54:48.179 --> 00:54:50.179
And along the way,

00:54:50.179 --> 00:54:52.179
I set up drug dealers

00:54:52.179 --> 00:54:54.179
who was dealing pretty big.

00:54:54.179 --> 00:54:56.179
After a year of that,

00:54:56.179 --> 00:54:58.179
and they reviewed my case

00:54:58.179 --> 00:55:00.179
and they gave me an opportunity

00:55:00.179 --> 00:55:03.179
to either keep working

00:55:03.179 --> 00:55:05.179
as one of their special agents

00:55:05.179 --> 00:55:07.179
so I got out of the business.

00:55:07.179 --> 00:55:09.179
So I chose to get out of the business.

00:55:09.179 --> 00:55:12.179
I had decided that I had to change my life.

00:55:12.179 --> 00:55:15.179
I was disgusted with the way I was living.

00:55:15.179 --> 00:55:17.179
And so I was sitting in my apartment

00:55:17.179 --> 00:55:19.179
late one afternoon

00:55:19.179 --> 00:55:21.179
and as a little lady, you know,

00:55:21.179 --> 00:55:22.179
knocked on the door,

00:55:22.179 --> 00:55:23.179
a little Japanese lady.

00:55:23.179 --> 00:55:25.179
I went to the door

00:55:25.179 --> 00:55:27.179
and I discerned that she wasn't trying

00:55:27.179 --> 00:55:30.179
to hustle me for anything.

00:55:30.179 --> 00:55:32.179
And so I invited her in.

00:55:32.179 --> 00:55:36.179
And she was talking about God and the Bible.

00:55:36.179 --> 00:55:39.179
And she had this little blue book, you know,

00:55:39.179 --> 00:55:41.179
a truth at least to eternal life.

00:55:41.179 --> 00:55:44.179
I said, sit to myself, here we go.

00:55:44.179 --> 00:55:47.179
That's when everything began to make sense.

00:55:47.179 --> 00:55:52.179
What now seems to me to be basic Bible doctrines

00:55:52.179 --> 00:55:55.179
were like bombshells to me.

00:55:55.179 --> 00:55:59.179
I mean, I was phenomenal

00:55:59.179 --> 00:56:02.179
the way that one visit

00:56:02.179 --> 00:56:05.179
changed my life that day.

00:56:05.179 --> 00:56:07.179
That very day, I knew that

00:56:07.179 --> 00:56:09.179
that was the truth

00:56:09.179 --> 00:56:11.179
and that I had to stick with it.

00:56:11.179 --> 00:56:13.179
The very next week,

00:56:13.179 --> 00:56:16.179
she came, took me to the Theocratic school

00:56:16.179 --> 00:56:17.179
and service meeting.

00:56:17.179 --> 00:56:20.179
And I've been going every sense.

00:56:20.179 --> 00:56:23.179
I realized that I had to

00:56:23.179 --> 00:56:26.179
change my lifestyle completely.

00:56:26.179 --> 00:56:28.179
I made rapid changes,

00:56:28.179 --> 00:56:30.179
internal changes.

00:56:30.179 --> 00:56:33.179
My whole thinking process has changed.

00:56:33.179 --> 00:56:37.179
I was baptized on August 30th, 1974.

00:56:37.179 --> 00:56:39.179
They I'll never forget.

00:56:39.179 --> 00:56:43.179
The best thing for me to do was to return home

00:56:43.179 --> 00:56:47.179
and go to the local congregation there

00:56:47.179 --> 00:56:49.179
where there would be, you know,

00:56:49.179 --> 00:56:52.179
literally qualified men to help me

00:56:52.179 --> 00:56:55.179
to continue to grow spiritually.

00:56:55.179 --> 00:56:58.179
I really, really wanted to go to Bethel

00:56:58.179 --> 00:57:01.179
and so I determined that that's

00:57:01.179 --> 00:57:03.179
what I was going to do.

00:57:03.179 --> 00:57:05.179
And so I made it a goal

00:57:05.179 --> 00:57:07.179
and I stuck with it, you know,

00:57:07.179 --> 00:57:10.179
for five years after I got home.

00:57:10.179 --> 00:57:14.179
And finally, I got the privilege.

00:57:14.179 --> 00:57:17.179
The privilege that was extended to me

00:57:17.179 --> 00:57:20.179
of coming to serve at Bethel

00:57:20.179 --> 00:57:23.179
has stretched out to be 35 years

00:57:23.179 --> 00:57:25.179
and I can't believe it.

00:57:25.179 --> 00:57:27.179
Since serving here at Bethel,

00:57:27.179 --> 00:57:30.179
I've served in a number of assignments.

00:57:30.179 --> 00:57:35.179
Currently, I serve as a desk receptionist,

00:57:35.179 --> 00:57:39.179
caring for building maintenance duties,

00:57:39.179 --> 00:57:41.179
the occupants of the building,

00:57:41.179 --> 00:57:43.179
greeting guests,

00:57:43.179 --> 00:57:45.179
and just generally trying to be

00:57:45.179 --> 00:57:48.179
as helpful as possible.

00:57:48.179 --> 00:57:51.179
I mean, I think about all the good things

00:57:51.179 --> 00:57:55.179
that Jehovah has done for me

00:57:55.179 --> 00:57:57.179
and for my wife, Bonnie.

00:57:57.179 --> 00:57:59.179
It's been phenomenal.

00:57:59.179 --> 00:58:02.179
I've learned that you can't really do anything

00:58:02.179 --> 00:58:04.179
in your own strength.

00:58:04.179 --> 00:58:07.179
Jehovah, he searches the heart.

00:58:07.179 --> 00:58:10.179
He looks for people who are yearning

00:58:10.179 --> 00:58:12.179
for something better, the direction,

00:58:12.179 --> 00:58:13.179
but only he can give.

00:58:13.179 --> 00:58:17.179
Because I shudder at the course I could have taken

00:58:17.179 --> 00:58:21.179
on a number of occasions that would have led to,

00:58:21.179 --> 00:58:23.179
you know, a different outcome.

00:58:23.179 --> 00:58:25.179
And so I'm very happy to be in the truth.

00:58:25.179 --> 00:58:29.179
It is absolutely on the best way of life.

00:58:29.179 --> 00:58:31.179
I don't know much,

00:58:31.179 --> 00:58:33.179
but I do know this.

00:58:33.179 --> 00:58:36.179
That Jehovah is real.

00:58:36.179 --> 00:58:40.179
He's very kind and merciful.

00:58:40.179 --> 00:58:44.670
I do know that.

00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:46.670
It was a delightful experience.

00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:49.670
Many of our viewers can relate to that experience

00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:51.670
and have come to appreciate a warm

00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:54.670
and abiding relationship with Jehovah.

00:58:54.670 --> 00:58:58.670
And even if we have been taught the truth from infancy,

00:58:58.670 --> 00:59:00.670
we are encouraged to observe how the truth

00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:03.670
can drastically change a person for the better.

00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:05.670
This moves us to share the good news

00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:07.670
of the kingdom with people regardless

00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:09.670
of their background or status.

00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:11.670
I couldn't agree more.

00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:13.670
Mark, thank you so much.

00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:16.670
It was a real pleasure to have you as co-host.

00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:17.670
Thank you.

00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:20.949
I'd like to come back to something

00:59:20.949 --> 00:59:23.949
that our panel touched on earlier.

00:59:23.949 --> 00:59:26.949
You know, some members of our congregations

00:59:26.949 --> 00:59:29.949
and not only the older brothers and sisters

00:59:29.949 --> 00:59:32.949
have no access to a computer.

00:59:32.949 --> 00:59:33.949
Now, they want to prepare for

00:59:33.949 --> 00:59:37.949
and participate in the meetings the same as everyone else.

00:59:37.949 --> 00:59:39.949
So during this month,

00:59:39.949 --> 00:59:41.949
please arrange for them to hear the new song

00:59:41.949 --> 00:59:44.949
and to get a copy of the lyrics, too.

00:59:44.949 --> 00:59:47.949
Now, others may own a computer,

00:59:47.949 --> 00:59:50.949
but don't take for granted that they know

00:59:50.949 --> 00:59:52.949
how to download a song in the lyrics.

00:59:52.949 --> 00:59:56.949
Many use a computer simply as a word processor.

00:59:56.949 --> 00:59:59.949
Now, here's a job for your younger brothers and sisters.

00:59:59.949 --> 01:00:02.949
Please make sure that they have what they need

01:00:02.949 --> 01:00:05.949
so that they can participate in the service meeting as well.

01:00:05.949 --> 01:00:10.230
Now, to the elders.

01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:13.230
If you're assigned to care for that 30-minute part

01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:15.230
during the week of January 5th,

01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:19.230
please, please prepare well.

01:00:19.230 --> 01:00:21.230
The entire governing body feels strongly

01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:24.230
that our kingdom songs are an important feature

01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:26.230
of our worship.

01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:28.230
Remember, dear friends,

01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:30.230
the Bible's largest single book,

01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:32.230
The Book of Songs,

01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:34.230
is really a song book.

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:39.230
It is a collection of 150 sacred songs.

01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:42.230
We thank all of you for joining us this month

01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:44.230
for this most encouraging program.

01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:46.230
Until next time,

01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:49.230
this is J.W. Broadcasting

01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:51.230
from Brooklyn, New York.
