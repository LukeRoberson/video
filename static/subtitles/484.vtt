00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:11.009
Our text for today, First Thessalonians chapter 2 and verse 7, is part of a very warm, comforting, and encouraging letter of First Thessalonians.

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:18.010
It's clear from the tone and message that the Apostle Paul really loved the brothers and sisters in Thessalonica.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:27.010
He was there at the founding of the congregation, and he saw the persecution that they endured with the Jews when they tried to come into the truth,

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.010
and he knew the persecution they were still going through.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.009
He was concerned about them, and he wanted to come see them in person.

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:41.009
If you look at First Thessalonians chapter 2 and verse 17, he says,

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:56.009
but when we were separated from you brothers, for just a short time, in person, not in our hearts, because of our very strong desire, we made every effort to see you in person.

00:00:56.009 --> 00:01:08.010
He was concerned about them, he really wanted to know how they were doing, but isn't that a nice expression that Paul uses, that while he couldn't be there in person, he was with them in his heart.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:15.010
We feel the same way, today, when we're separated from our families, our congregations, our close friends.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:21.010
We are with them, not in person, but we are with them in our hearts.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:30.010
Since he couldn't be there in person, Paul sent Timothy, and Timothy came back with a very good report about how the brothers and sisters were doing,

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.010
and therefore then Paul writes this inspired letter of First Thessalonians to them.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:41.010
Now First Thessalonians is an excellent example of a well-written and encouraging letter.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:51.010
If you're looking for ideas on how to write an encouraging letter to others, First Thessalonians is a good example to study and look at.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.010
It's a very heartfelt and meaningful letter.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.010
If you read or listen to the whole letter, it only takes about 15 minutes.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:06.010
You can easily imagine that Paul was alive today and wrote that letter to you and your congregation.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.009
It's so warm and encouraging you may want to listen to it several times.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:18.009
It feels really appropriate to the trials and challenges that we, many of us, are facing today.

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:23.009
Let's take a look at a few verses from First Thessalonians that can help us to endure our current trials,

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:26.009
and we're going to cover four basic themes.

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:32.009
Commendation, gentleness, friendship, and consoling.

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:34.009
First, let's talk about commendation.

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:41.009
If we look at First Thessalonians 1 and 3, so all these verses are from First Thessalonians,

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:50.009
verse 3, chapter 1, for we continually remember your faithful work, your loving labor, your endurance because of your hope,

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:55.009
in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the presence of our God and Father.

00:02:55.009 --> 00:03:02.009
Yes, look for occasions to commend others and be as specific as possible.

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:13.009
One sister got a text message recently from another sister thanking her and her husband for something they had done over 10 years ago for that couple.

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:21.009
Well, how do you feel when you receive a well-written card, text message, or email that commend you for something that you have done,

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:24.009
or recall something that you did for someone?

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:29.009
You feel encouraged, strengthened, you feel happy.

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:36.009
See, commendation helps all of us to know that others see the good that we're doing and they appreciate it.

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:43.009
The apostle Paul described his reaction when he got the good report from Timothy about how they were doing.

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:48.009
He used a phrase in chapter 3 and verse 8, he said, we are revitalized.

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:55.009
And it's not a good way to put it that when we get commendation and we hear a good report, we're revitalized.

00:03:56.009 --> 00:04:03.009
Now, next after commendation, let's consider our text for today, chapter 2 and verse 7.

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:12.009
He said, on the contrary, we became gentle in your midst as when a nursing mother tenderly cares for her own children.

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:14.009
Yes, gentleness.

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:23.009
When you get a cut on your hand and someone else wants to help you take care of it, how do you want that cut to be handled?

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:25.009
Gently, it hurts.

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:33.009
Well, emotionally, many people today are really hurt and we need to care for them gently.

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:42.290
Our conversations, our text messages, emails, letters, are we gentle?

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:50.290
With the stress and pressures of life in this old system, it can be easy to be abrupt or curt or short in our dealings with others.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:57.290
When we're going to send an email, do we read it over and think for a moment before we press a send?

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:08.290
If you receive an email that's very strong or bit biting, are we gentle in our response, realizing that others are also feeling the emotional strain of things?

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:14.290
Do we take time to express our tender heart and care?

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:22.290
For example, we may send a card or a text message with a couple of scriptures cited and this is always appreciated.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:38.500
But one sister said that what she appreciated even more was when someone sent a card and they actually wrote out the phrase in the scripture that they appreciated and said why that scripture or phrase meant something to them.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.500
After gentleness, he mentions friendship.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:48.740
Let's look at chapter 2 and verse 8.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:06:00.740
So having tender affection for you, we were determined to impart to you not only the good news of God but also our very selves because you became so beloved to us.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.740
Well, that expression, in part to you, our very selves is powerful.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.740
Paul was just not their Bible teacher but he was a close friend.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.740
All of us need close friends, especially these days.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:25.740
Once that you can talk to, express your feelings to them, be confident that they're going to listen and respect your thoughts and privacy.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.740
Paul came to really love the brothers and sisters in Thessalonica.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:36.740
He did not treat them as a to-do list or checking off things or this is my job to teach them the Bible and move on.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.740
The relationship went deeper than that.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:48.740
Now, we may work together, we may be in the same congregation, we may have a meal together, but that does not automatically make us friends.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:58.740
The old saying to have a friend, you have to be a friend, illustrates that being a friend really takes a lot of effort and work on our part.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:05.740
Are we true friends with others? Are we taking the initiative to make close friends?

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:12.740
As Paul says, it really means giving of our very selves.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:21.139
Now, after friendship, he mentions consoling if we look at chapter 2 and verse 11.

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:31.139
He says, you well know that we kept exhorting and consoling you and bearing witness to each one of you just as a father does his children.

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:37.139
Well, earlier, the Apostle Paul had used a mother to illustrate a gentleness.

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:41.139
Now, he uses a father to illustrate consoling.

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:51.139
We can see that the Apostle Paul really felt like he was family with the congregation there in Thessalonians and Thessalonica.

00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:56.139
Now, life has some very sad and tragic events.

00:07:57.139 --> 00:08:04.139
And a good father knows how to console and comfort his children when things go wrong and bad things happen.

00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:16.139
Paul knew that the Thessalonians were actually going through a tough time, and many of them had suffered the loss of death of friends or family.

00:08:16.139 --> 00:08:26.139
Notice his very consoling reasoning in chapter 5 of which we'll just read one verse about the hope of the resurrection.

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:28.139
Let's look at verse 10.

00:08:28.139 --> 00:08:37.139
He died for us so that whether we stay awake or are asleep, we should live together with him.

00:08:37.139 --> 00:08:41.549
Well, that's so consoling, isn't it?

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:47.549
Death does not break that person's relationship with Jehovah.

00:08:47.549 --> 00:08:52.549
Alive or dead, Jehovah loves all of us.

00:08:52.549 --> 00:09:10.549
So if we review, the inspired advice in Paul's warm and loving letter to his friends in Thessalonica can encourage all of us to command, to be gentle, to show true friendship, and console one another.

00:09:11.549 --> 00:09:22.549
And as we head deeper into this old system, it's kind of like watching the chaos on a ship when the passengers realize that the ship is sinking.

00:09:22.549 --> 00:09:27.549
We though, on the other hand, are in the lifeboats, and we're together.

00:09:27.549 --> 00:09:34.549
We're trying to help one another make it through this situation until we can be rescued.

00:09:34.549 --> 00:09:40.549
We're comforting, consoling, and helping one another and waiting to be rescued.

00:09:40.549 --> 00:09:54.549
So to all of you, we can say the words of chapter 5 and verse 11, therefore keep encouraging one another and building one another up just as you are in fact doing.
