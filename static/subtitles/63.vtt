00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:08.140
Welcome to JW Broadcasting. Here are some highlights from this month's program.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.140
What should we do if we encounter spiritism in some form?

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.140
And how can we help others break free from it?

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:21.140
This dramatization will provide some valuable principles.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.140
We've all beheld the wonders of creation.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:35.140
This month's beautiful music video will move us to pause, think, and thank Jehovah for his magnificent works.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.140
And we go to World Headquarters to visit another museum.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:46.140
We'll see how, in our time, Jehovah is blessing a people for his name.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.140
This is the August 2019 edition of JW Broadcasting.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:17.049
Our broadcast this month has the theme, Cherish your privilege of prayer.

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:23.049
Do you think it's appropriate to label prayer as a miracle?

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:40.049
Miracles are described in our New World Translation Glossary of Bible terms as actions are phenomena that surpass all powers known to humans and are attributed to a supernatural agency.

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.049
Does prayer fit that description?

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:57.049
The moment you say a prayer, your innermost thoughts and feelings are communicated instantly to the creator from wherever you are, even if you pray silently.

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.049
That certainly beyond any power humans know.

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:11.050
Therefore, the fact that a human can call out to God in prayer and be heard by Him is truly a miracle.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:20.050
It's only by the undeserved kindness of Jehovah that we can approach his heavenly throne in prayer.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:27.050
Today our lives are very complicated and in some cases very troubled.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:34.050
Whether young or old, there are times we may feel overwhelmed with our problems.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.050
At other times we may simply feel alone and helpless.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.050
What can we do?

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.050
The Apostle Paul says that prayer will help.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:55.050
Please open your Bible to Philippians 4-6 and listen to his spirit inspired recommendations.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:07.050
Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication, along with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:14.050
So Paul is saying that in all circumstances of life, prayer is essential.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:23.050
While no one around us can see the inner struggles we may be having, Jehovah sees them.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.050
What will you do?

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.050
Let's read verse 7.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:37.050
And the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:51.050
This incomparable peace of God is an unusual tranquility enjoyed by Jehovah's dedicated servants, even in the most trying circumstances.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:59.050
Have you felt that inner peace that results from intimate communication with Jehovah?

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:09.050
How much we benefit from prayer is closely related to the strength of our personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:16.050
A key factor in that relationship is found at Psalm 37-3.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:24.050
Trust in Jehovah and do what is good, reside in the earth and act with faithfulness.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:32.050
Likely, you'd agree that when we need to talk to someone about our worries, we go to a trusted friend. Why?

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.050
It's because we've developed a relationship with him.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:42.050
He knows us and our situation, and we know we can count on him.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:50.050
More than ever, we need a close personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:05:06.050
For that to be possible, we must be convinced that Jehovah knows who we are and that he understands us, our situation, our worries, our concerns, and our needs.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.050
Notice what Jehovah promises in verses 4 and 5.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:17.050
Find exquisite delight in Jehovah, and he will grant you the desires of your heart.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:24.050
Commit your way to Jehovah, rely on him, and he will act in your behalf.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:35.050
Jehovah does know who we are. He understands us better than anyone else, even better than we understand ourselves.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:41.050
He invites us to trust him, and he promises to act in our behalf.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:49.050
The miracle of prayer lets us experience Jehovah's love in a truly intimate way.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:57.050
Our Father personally takes the time to listen to us. He has not delegated that to anyone else.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:05.050
However, you might be wondering, why would the Creator of the universe want to listen to me?

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:13.050
The inspired answer at 1 Peter 5.7 says, because he cares for you.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:24.050
Your determination to keep doing the best you can to serve him in spite of all the problems you face endears you to him.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:29.050
He feels for you and is eager to help.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:36.050
How does that make you feel? At Psalm 111, it says,

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:43.050
I love Jehovah because he hears my voice, my pleas for help.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:53.050
Even though we can't see him listening to us, it's as if we feel Jehovah's loving arms around us when we pray.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:07:01.050
As a result, the more we pray, the more our love and trust in him grows.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:06.050
What else will help us to build our love and trust in our God, Jehovah?

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:16.050
It's more than recognizing that he hears our prayers. We must be convinced that he answers our prayers.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:20.050
What evidence do we have that Jehovah answers prayers?

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:26.050
Let's look at some specific answers to prayers both past and present.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:30.050
Open your Bible to 2 Chronicles 20.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:39.050
When Judah was threatened by the combined forces of Ammon and Moab in the mountainous region of Seer,

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:44.050
King Jehosaphat humbly prayed for Jehovah's help.

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.050
In verse 12, he prayed,

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:53.050
Oh, our God, will you not execute judgment on them?

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:58.050
For we are powerless before this large crowd that is coming against us,

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:04.050
and we do not know what we should do, but our eyes are toward you.

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:07.050
What was Jehovah's answer?

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:13.050
There was no voice from heaven. Jehovah caused a prophet to speak up.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.050
Verse 15 says,

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:18.050
Here is what Jehovah says to you,

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:27.050
Do not be afraid or be terrified because of this large crowd for the battle is not yours, but God's.

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:30.050
Then verse 17 continues,

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:33.049
You will not need to fight this battle.

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:41.049
Take your position, stand still and see the salvation of Jehovah in your behalf.

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:43.049
Did you note the formula?

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:47.049
Jehovah's dedicated servant is facing a serious problem.

00:08:47.049 --> 00:08:51.049
He prays specifically,

00:08:51.049 --> 00:08:55.049
and then he remains attentive to the answer.

00:08:55.049 --> 00:09:00.049
The answer may have seemed strange to Jehosaphat.

00:09:00.049 --> 00:09:03.049
Jehovah didn't provide a battle plan.

00:09:03.049 --> 00:09:05.049
As strategies go,

00:09:05.049 --> 00:09:10.049
just walking out to meet the enemy doesn't sound like a very good one.

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:15.049
But Jehosaphat discerned that this was the answer from Jehovah,

00:09:15.049 --> 00:09:18.049
and he let it direct his actions.

00:09:18.049 --> 00:09:20.049
What happened?

00:09:20.049 --> 00:09:29.049
Jehovah fought for Judah by striking confusion into the ranks of the enemy so that they slaughtered one another.

00:09:29.049 --> 00:09:35.049
Jehosaphat's prayer was answered in a mighty way.

00:09:35.049 --> 00:09:41.049
We have examples in the first century of collective prayers being answered.

00:09:41.049 --> 00:09:47.049
One occasion was when King Herod was out to gain the favor of the Jews.

00:09:47.049 --> 00:09:53.049
So he had the Apostle Peter imprisoned and placed under heavy guard.

00:09:53.049 --> 00:09:56.049
What would the congregation do?

00:09:56.049 --> 00:10:00.049
Acts 12-5 gives us the answer.

00:10:00.049 --> 00:10:03.049
So Peter was being kept in the prison,

00:10:03.049 --> 00:10:08.049
but the congregation was intensely praying to God for him.

00:10:08.049 --> 00:10:12.049
Did Jehovah answer their prayers in behalf of Peter?

00:10:12.049 --> 00:10:21.049
The account in verses 7-11 tells us that an angel of Jehovah led Peter out of jail

00:10:21.049 --> 00:10:24.049
and delivered him to safety.

00:10:24.049 --> 00:10:31.049
Imagine how these events must have drawn the Christians in Jerusalem closer to Jehovah

00:10:31.049 --> 00:10:36.049
when they saw that he had answered their prayers.

00:10:36.049 --> 00:10:39.049
What about today?

00:10:39.049 --> 00:10:43.049
Consider the example of our brothers in South Korea.

00:10:43.049 --> 00:10:54.049
Over the years, more than 19,000 of our brothers have been imprisoned as conscientious objectors to military service.

00:10:54.049 --> 00:11:04.049
Did you personally pray in behalf of these brothers that they might endure in their faith or that they might be released from prison

00:11:04.049 --> 00:11:06.049
if it was Jehovah's will?

00:11:06.049 --> 00:11:08.049
We're sure you did.

00:11:08.049 --> 00:11:12.049
In fact, many of you prayed for these brothers by name,

00:11:12.049 --> 00:11:18.049
just as the congregation in the first century prayed in behalf of Peter.

00:11:18.049 --> 00:11:20.049
With what result?

00:11:20.049 --> 00:11:30.049
In 2018, a series of court rulings in South Korea finally recognized conscientious objection to military service

00:11:30.049 --> 00:11:36.049
for religious reasons as a fundamental human right,

00:11:36.049 --> 00:11:42.049
and our brothers were gradually released from their prison bonds.

00:11:42.049 --> 00:11:43.049
What do you think?

00:11:43.049 --> 00:11:49.049
Did Jehovah hear our prayers in behalf of these dear brothers?

00:11:49.049 --> 00:11:59.049
As a worldwide brotherhood, there can be no doubt that our incessant prayers to Jehovah were a major factor

00:11:59.049 --> 00:12:08.049
in these marvelous developments, and we praise and thank Jehovah that he's heard our prayers.

00:12:08.049 --> 00:12:15.049
What does this review of how Jehovah answered the prayers of his servants in the past and present due for us?

00:12:15.049 --> 00:12:23.049
Doesn't it build confidence that Jehovah is listening and acting on the prayers of his people?

00:12:23.049 --> 00:12:27.049
The Apostle John had that confidence.

00:12:27.049 --> 00:12:31.049
He wrote at first John 514,

00:12:31.049 --> 00:12:35.049
and this is the confidence that we have toward him,

00:12:35.049 --> 00:12:41.049
that no matter what we ask according to his will, he hears us.

00:12:41.049 --> 00:12:50.049
But now the question is, when was the last time that Jehovah answered one of your personal prayers?

00:12:50.049 --> 00:12:56.049
We spend much time on learning how to pray and what to pray for,

00:12:56.049 --> 00:13:03.049
but do we put forth enough effort on identifying the answers to our prayers?

00:13:03.049 --> 00:13:14.049
For us to have the closeness to Jehovah, we must be certain that he's listening and responding to our personal prayers.

00:13:14.049 --> 00:13:20.049
It may not always be readily discernible just how some prayers are answered.

00:13:20.049 --> 00:13:22.049
So what can we do?

00:13:22.049 --> 00:13:29.049
Take time to meditate on Jehovah's response to your prayerful requests.

00:13:29.049 --> 00:13:35.049
If you're married, freely discuss matters that you've prayed for in common

00:13:35.049 --> 00:13:39.049
and how Jehovah may be answering those prayers.

00:13:39.049 --> 00:13:44.049
Be observant and alert to things that are happening around you

00:13:44.049 --> 00:13:50.049
and learn to connect these things with the answers to your prayers.

00:13:50.049 --> 00:13:57.049
Make your prayers more specific and you'll become more keenly aware of Jehovah's answers,

00:13:57.049 --> 00:14:01.049
even though they may be subtle.

00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:08.049
Identifying your answered prayers will make Jehovah more real to you.

00:14:09.049 --> 00:14:19.049
This process of identifying answers to our prayers should be learned early on in one spiritual development.

00:14:19.049 --> 00:14:30.049
We cannot take it for granted that our children or our Bible students will connect the answers they receive to the prayers they've offered.

00:14:30.049 --> 00:14:40.049
One witness said, I find that people feel closer to God if I help them to recognize answers to their prayers.

00:14:40.049 --> 00:14:47.360
What if we can't identify the answer to one of our prayers?

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:51.360
Does that mean it wasn't according to Jehovah's will?

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.360
Not necessarily.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:58.360
There are two important factors that might be involved.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:06.360
One is that Jehovah knows the best time and way to answer our prayers.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:11.360
He takes all matters into consideration.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:17.360
The answer may not come according to our time table, but it will come.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:23.360
So we must be patient and keep looking for the answer.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:32.360
The second factor that Jehovah considers is the issue raised by Satan regarding man's integrity.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:41.360
Listen again to the challenge Satan makes as recorded at Job 1, 10, and 11.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:47.360
Have you not put up a protective hedge around him in his house and everything he has?

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:53.360
You have blessed the work of his hands and his livestock his spread out in the land.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:16:03.360
But for a change, stretch out your hand and strike everything he has and he will surely curse you to your very face.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:09.360
Jehovah permitted this issue to be raised out of love for his intelligent creatures.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:16.360
He permitted Job to undergo a test by Satan before the entire universe.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:30.360
Jehovah gives his creatures the privilege of proving the devil a liar and of removing the slander not only from God's name, but also from their own.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:37.360
So Jehovah seeing the entire issue may allow his servants to endure trials.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:43.360
But that doesn't mean he's not answering the prayer the afflicted.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:54.360
When we're under trial, we may have prayed for relief, but we may have also prayed let your name be sanctified.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:17:04.359
We must remain convinced that Jehovah will not simply answer a prayer he will provide the best answer.

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:15.359
Isn't it true that when we maintain our integrity, even through serious illness, it can be a tremendous witness to others?

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:18.359
That was the case with Jared Scepter.

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:32.660
Cutsworth says, remember then your grand creator in the days of your youth before the days of your stress calm.

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:38.660
In the days of distress, they arrived early on Jared at 11.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:43.660
Jared was diagnosed with lymphoma cancer in the middle of 1991.

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:55.660
We started trying to figure out how we could get him the treatment that he needed of course, but in no way would we accept a blood transfusion and neither would Jared.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:18:02.660
But Jared was in the hospital child protection services did investigate us. They were concerned there was negligence.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.660
It was just adding to the pain.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:10.660
The way it turned out, they back completely away from that. They realized we hadn't been negligent.

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:34.660
So as we face different situations, we pray at the time not to have miraculous answers, but for Jehovah to open our eyes and to be able to find things and it seemed as though he was really directing us so that we could take care of ourselves spiritually through this situation as well as take care of Jared's medical needs.

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:47.660
I remember many times falling on my knees and praying and thinking this is it, I'm test to be on what I can bear and Jehovah would strengthen me.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:53.660
And someone would come or they would say something and they fed us.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:58.660
The brother made a schedule and he said, you're going to feed these friends.

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:05.660
And the brother's instructions were, you don't bring it and just drop the food, you stay with those friends.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:10.660
It made me cry, the love, and the caring that we experienced.

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:19.660
One time I remember the hallways of this hospital, 1500 miles away from our hope, started filling up with people.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:23.660
To me, that's answering prayers too.

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:26.660
It was hard for us to get out of the hospital.

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:35.660
So they recorded talks, they would look us in the eye and they'd say, now you need to listen to this. It will keep you strong.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:44.660
Jared was worried about us and he made it clear. He was going to be fine. He just didn't know if we were going to be.

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:52.660
He died in June of 1992. He was at home.

00:19:52.660 --> 00:20:08.180
And the last thing he said to us was, work hard so we can all be together again.

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:14.180
It's numbing because it's almost like you're living in nightmare.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:21.920
Because you never think that those things all happened to you.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:28.920
But it did. I didn't want people to see me cry. I didn't want pity.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:39.259
I didn't. Because of that, those negative feelings, my imagination, were in wild.

00:20:39.259 --> 00:20:48.259
What helped me, I know was Gary putting into my heart and mind that this is a fight.

00:20:48.259 --> 00:20:53.259
It's been a challenge for all mankind that if you make a heart on them, they don't love you.

00:20:53.259 --> 00:21:00.890
Satan said that about Jehovah and individuals. So I would be giving into that.

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:06.890
The strong feelings I had in my sorrow almost made me stop.

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:10.890
I prayed a lot to go back to the Kingdom of all.

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:14.890
The congregation cried. They lost a little boy.

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:19.890
It wasn't just Gary and Beth. They lost a little boy. They cried.

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:28.539
I didn't feel alone. We hugged, we cried together.

00:21:28.539 --> 00:21:37.069
It really benefited us to get right back in the spiritual focus and get our mind up ourselves.

00:21:37.069 --> 00:21:42.069
And I could have gave in to my pain and thought, well, I'm too heartbroken.

00:21:42.069 --> 00:21:47.069
It made me have more joy because I realize that now they have all.

00:21:48.069 --> 00:21:53.069
People around us were vital. The support system Jehovah has.

00:21:53.069 --> 00:21:58.069
And his word, his spirit, Jehovah answered those prayers.

00:21:58.069 --> 00:22:02.069
Our goal was really to stay in the full-time ministry.

00:22:02.069 --> 00:22:07.069
Maybe doing something else, but we never ever thought we would be in the circuit work.

00:22:07.069 --> 00:22:15.069
But to have our daughter working with their husband in the circuit work, it's almost hard to believe it's happening.

00:22:15.069 --> 00:22:19.069
We look forward to seeing Jared again having him back with us.

00:22:19.069 --> 00:22:24.069
So I'm waning and I know I'm not going to be disappointed.

00:22:24.069 --> 00:22:33.069
How encouraging to know that Gary and Beth are able to take vacation time to travel occasionally to see their daughter and her husband,

00:22:33.069 --> 00:22:37.069
who are also serving in the traveling work.

00:22:37.069 --> 00:22:49.069
And did you notice how Gary, Beth, and Jared felt Jehovah's loving support as they prayed throughout this heart-wrenching trial?

00:22:49.069 --> 00:22:54.069
They asked for wisdom when seeking medical treatment for Jared.

00:22:54.069 --> 00:23:02.069
Jehovah put his arms around them and listened when they felt overwhelmed with grief and negative feelings.

00:23:02.069 --> 00:23:11.069
He strengthened Jared's hope in the resurrection and helped brother and sister-sector stay spiritually strong.

00:23:11.069 --> 00:23:17.069
Can there be any doubt that Jehovah was answering their prayers?

00:23:17.069 --> 00:23:27.069
Doesn't that strengthen our conviction that Jehovah will also answer Jared's prayer that they all will be together again?

00:23:27.069 --> 00:23:32.069
No, Jehovah didn't miraculously cure Jared.

00:23:32.069 --> 00:23:47.069
But through his endurance and strong faith, Jerry gives a witness to the universe that even a child that trust in Jehovah can prove his loyalty to death.

00:23:47.069 --> 00:23:54.069
Now, other situations may turn out differently and not end up in death.

00:23:54.069 --> 00:24:03.069
If an individual feels that relief was because of Jehovah's intervention, he should certainly give thanks.

00:24:03.069 --> 00:24:18.069
However, we must recognize that Jehovah knows the best way to handle matters so that it results in honor to his name and to the lasting good of his servants.

00:24:18.069 --> 00:24:28.069
Finally, it's worth mentioning that the Bible often connects our remaining spiritually alert with our need to pray.

00:24:28.069 --> 00:24:38.069
At Matthew 26.41, Jesus said, keep on the watch and pray continually.

00:24:38.069 --> 00:24:43.069
At first Peter 4.7, Peter wrote,

00:24:43.069 --> 00:24:54.069
but the end of all things has drawn close, therefore be sound in mind and be vigilant with a view to prayers.

00:24:54.069 --> 00:25:11.069
Indeed, our prayers are so important, our personal prayers will help us to remain spiritually alert and active in God's service as we await the great tribulation that lies just ahead of us.

00:25:11.069 --> 00:25:23.069
So in summary, our prayers to Jehovah reveal the closeness of our relationship with Him and the degree of our dependence upon Him.

00:25:23.069 --> 00:25:32.069
They show the trueness of our faith, the depth of our devotion and the genuineness of our appreciation.

00:25:33.069 --> 00:25:43.069
Our prayers also help us remain spiritually alert as we endure these last days before the great tribulation.

00:25:43.069 --> 00:25:51.069
We'll be drawn even closer to Jehovah when we learn to recognize his answers to our prayers.

00:25:51.069 --> 00:26:02.069
Yes, we can be assured that Jehovah will not fail in giving us the desires of our heart as we continue rendering him sacred service.

00:26:02.069 --> 00:26:10.069
May we all cherish our marvelous, miraculous privilege of prayer.

00:26:10.069 --> 00:26:21.380
Let's look at one practical example when prayer is of utmost importance, when confronted with the powers of wicked spirits.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:32.380
Spiritism is very real and dangerous. Yet with Jehovah's help, people can break free from its hold.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:38.380
In this dramatization, notice how one sister helped her Bible student to do that.

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:51.059
Emma and I were so worried about her Bible study, Balessa.

00:26:51.059 --> 00:26:58.059
She had spent another sleepless night after again hearing a dead grandmother's voice.

00:26:58.059 --> 00:27:12.339
Plus, the sound of slamming doors and items crashing in the house.

00:27:12.339 --> 00:27:21.339
Balessa put an amulet on a baby's wrist for protection, but the terror continued all night long.

00:27:21.339 --> 00:27:31.339
Of course, it wasn't really her grandmother and nothing in the house was broken, but the attack was real.

00:27:31.339 --> 00:27:43.250
Stories about the spirit world were new to me.

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:48.250
Our neighbors, the people I work with, the people in our territory.

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:53.250
Almost everyone believes in spirit, whether they admit it or not.

00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:59.250
No, more than believe, they fear them.

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:05.250
I had only been studying the Bible about six months longer than Balessa.

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:16.250
But my study had proved to me that wicked spirits are here on earth, that they try to interact with people, and that they are dangerous enemies.

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:24.069
Emma called her elders for help. She didn't want us to handle a situation on our own.

00:28:24.069 --> 00:28:37.660
As Emma told the story, I had to speak up and tell the elders that she was living things out.

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:45.650
But I was surprised when the elders said they didn't need all the details.

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:54.650
They explained that while we are aware of the danger that demons pose, we do not spend time talking about their activities.

00:28:54.650 --> 00:29:02.650
Even Jesus, when he was on earth, could have told his disciples many stories about the doings of wicked spirit.

00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:07.650
But instead, he focused on Jehovah and his activities.

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:15.650
We should do the same, instead of telling stories about what the demons may or may not have done.

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:20.650
The elders skillfully used the Bible, shepherding everyone.

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:23.650
We read Ephesians 6 verse 11,

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:36.359
We put on the complete suit of armor from God, so that you may be able to stand firm against the crafty acts of the devil.

00:29:36.359 --> 00:29:40.359
Those instructions were so important.

00:29:40.359 --> 00:29:47.359
A soldier would be vulnerable if he only wore part of his armor, or if he didn't keep it in good repay.

00:29:47.359 --> 00:29:56.190
Then, we read Ephesians 4 verse 27,

00:29:56.190 --> 00:30:01.190
Do not give the devil an opportunity.

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:08.190
The elders explained to Baleza that the string around the daughter's wrist is not part of the armor from God.

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:16.079
Instead, it is giving Satan an opportunity to continue to arrest the family.

00:30:16.079 --> 00:30:29.079
The brothers reminded us that anyone who wants Jehovah's protection must completely break free from anything associated with superstition, spiritism and demon worship.

00:30:29.079 --> 00:30:38.059
Who would ever choose to side with wicked spirits instead of with Jehovah?

00:30:38.059 --> 00:30:42.059
Emma reminded Baleza of how agent the situation was.

00:30:42.059 --> 00:30:46.059
But only Baleza could decide what she would do.

00:30:46.059 --> 00:31:07.460
I want to be a loyal servant of Jehovah.

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:10.460
That's why I'm getting baptized.

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:16.460
I've decided not to listen to or tell any more stories about the demons.

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:21.460
But more than that, I needed to look at other parts of my life.

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:26.460
Am I doing anything that would give the devil an opportunity?

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:31.460
Clearly, there are still changes I need to make.

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:35.460
Did you notice how they prayed for Jehovah's direction?

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:40.460
They followed the principle of Psalm 37-5.

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:47.460
Commit your way to Jehovah, rely on him, and he will act in your behalf.

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:52.460
And as you notice, as he's committing his life course to Jehovah,

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:57.460
Thomas's Christian conscience has now started to guide him.

00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:05.460
And he likely realizes that he has to safeguard his heart from things that may tempt him.

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:09.460
In this Bethel morning worship, Brother Morris of the governing body

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:15.460
helps us to see why it requires effort to protect our relationship with Jehovah.

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:20.460
This morning's what we talk about, accepting the facts about our figurative heart

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:24.460
and how that safeguards our relationship with Jehovah.

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:29.460
Let's read today's text in its entirety.

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:33.460
Jeremiah chapter 17.

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:40.460
And what a soul-bring inspired thought from our Heavenly Father.

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:45.460
Jeremiah 17 and will reverse nine.

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:51.460
The heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate.

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:54.460
So there we have it. That's the truth.

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:57.460
That's what your Jehovah makes very clear to us.

00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:04.460
That each and every one of us have to deal with a treacherous or deceitful figurative heart.

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:13.460
And how encompassing the expression here more treacherous than anything else, my?

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:17.460
And what complicates it even more is its desperate.

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:20.460
It always wants its way.

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:23.460
So a lot to meditate on.

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:28.460
And now, Jehovah put it here for the very reason we have to accept this fact.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:32.460
And it's a safeguard of relationship with him.

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:35.460
We have to accept that this is the case.

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:39.460
And you could be a fine Christian for many years.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:43.460
A mature, nice outlook, nice attitude.

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:48.460
But if you ever find yourself forgetting Jehovah's estimation

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:54.460
of what we have within us in our figurative heart, then we're in danger.

00:33:54.460 --> 00:34:01.460
Because the devil will always exploit the fact that our imperfect figurative hearts are treacherous,

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:06.460
deceitful, more than anything else and is desperate.

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:10.460
So accepting that fact, it's not that you want to dwell on,

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:17.460
it's our feeling of what a miserable person I am, even though that is something the Apostle Paul acknowledged,

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:19.460
it's just accepting the fact.

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:25.460
And then we're cautious about allowing the treacherous heart to lead us astray.

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:29.460
Now, perhaps you haven't thought about this in a while,

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:36.460
but notice what Jesus said, fundamental truth for all of us here in Matthew 6.

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:41.460
And what we sometimes refer to as the model prayer,

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:49.739
Matthew 6, and a lot of spiritual food for thought.

00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:55.739
Of course, anything Jesus said is spiritual food for thought.

00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:59.739
And verse 13 of Matthew 6,

00:34:59.739 --> 00:35:03.739
and do not bring us into temptation,

00:35:03.739 --> 00:35:07.739
but deliver us from the wicked one.

00:35:08.739 --> 00:35:13.739
So, been there for all these years,

00:35:13.739 --> 00:35:21.739
we could personally reflect on when's the last time we mentioned that in a prayer to our Father, Jehovah.

00:35:21.739 --> 00:35:28.739
Do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the wicked one, or rescues from the wicked one.

00:35:28.739 --> 00:35:31.739
What are we really saying there?

00:35:31.739 --> 00:35:36.739
Well, we're asking our Heavenly Father to guide and help us,

00:35:36.739 --> 00:35:39.739
so that we're not overreached by Satan.

00:35:39.739 --> 00:35:42.739
Very simple.

00:35:42.739 --> 00:35:44.739
But the closer we get to the end,

00:35:44.739 --> 00:35:50.739
Magnumostec gets even more urgent to keep in mind the need to beg Jehovah.

00:35:50.739 --> 00:35:57.739
It's not bring us into temptation to guide us so that we'll be delivered from this wicked one

00:35:57.739 --> 00:36:05.739
who wants to exploit the fact that we have a treacherous, traitorous figure of heart,

00:36:05.739 --> 00:36:09.739
and that can ruin our relationship with Jehovah personally.

00:36:09.739 --> 00:36:12.739
Now, the Apostle Paul recognized this,

00:36:12.739 --> 00:36:19.739
and it's quite interesting what he wrote to his beloved brothers and Thessalonians at first letter,

00:36:19.739 --> 00:36:25.739
so if you'd find first Thessalonians in chapter 3,

00:36:26.739 --> 00:36:30.739
found this quite revealing,

00:36:30.739 --> 00:36:36.739
and tying in with the thought of accepting the facts about our figurative heart safeguards,

00:36:36.739 --> 00:36:40.739
our relationship with our God and Father, Jehovah.

00:36:40.739 --> 00:36:45.739
First, that's only chapter 3 and verse 5.

00:36:45.739 --> 00:36:46.739
Paul writes,

00:36:46.739 --> 00:36:49.739
That is why when I could bear it no longer,

00:36:49.739 --> 00:36:55.739
I sent to learn of your faithfulness, now notice, in case somehow,

00:36:55.739 --> 00:36:58.739
the tempter might have tempted you,

00:36:58.739 --> 00:37:01.739
and our labor might have turned out to be in vain.

00:37:01.739 --> 00:37:05.739
So, hitting it into any specific detail,

00:37:05.739 --> 00:37:11.739
but it helps us to appreciate that there's this danger that somehow,

00:37:11.739 --> 00:37:15.739
the tempter, Satan, the devil, might tempt us.

00:37:15.739 --> 00:37:18.739
Connected with the need to beg Jehovah to deliver us,

00:37:18.739 --> 00:37:21.739
or rescues from the wicked one,

00:37:21.739 --> 00:37:25.739
in his effort to tempt us to break our integrity,

00:37:25.739 --> 00:37:30.739
and our cherished relationship with Jehovah being damaged.

00:37:30.739 --> 00:37:33.739
So, he knows the heart stretchers,

00:37:33.739 --> 00:37:37.739
and whoever we are, and however long we've been in the truth,

00:37:37.739 --> 00:37:41.739
remember what Paul wrote to the Thessalonians, somehow,

00:37:41.739 --> 00:37:45.739
because he's always looking to somehow lead us

00:37:45.739 --> 00:37:48.739
into breaking our integrity to Jehovah God.

00:37:48.739 --> 00:37:52.739
Now, if you think of Revelation chapter 12,

00:37:52.739 --> 00:37:56.739
and where we are in this stream of time,

00:37:56.739 --> 00:38:00.739
this occurred to me when it was preparing these thoughts here,

00:38:00.739 --> 00:38:05.739
Revelation 12, very familiar thoughts here,

00:38:05.739 --> 00:38:10.739
devils expelled from the heavens in the demons,

00:38:10.739 --> 00:38:14.739
and notice a familiar verse 12, Revelation 12,

00:38:14.739 --> 00:38:18.739
on this account be glad you heavens, and boy, they're rejoicing.

00:38:18.739 --> 00:38:20.739
Was it residing them?

00:38:20.739 --> 00:38:22.739
And that's an exclamation.

00:38:22.739 --> 00:38:27.739
Notice though, woe for the earth and for the sea,

00:38:27.739 --> 00:38:31.739
because the devil has come down to you having great anger,

00:38:31.739 --> 00:38:35.739
knowing that he has a short period of time.

00:38:35.739 --> 00:38:39.739
Well, if that was true after he was ousted from the heavens,

00:38:39.739 --> 00:38:42.739
what do you think about now?

00:38:42.739 --> 00:38:46.739
So sobering, we want to safeguard our relationship with Jehovah,

00:38:46.739 --> 00:38:51.739
because it actually, notice verse 17, same chapter.

00:38:51.739 --> 00:38:54.739
So the dragon became enraged.

00:38:54.739 --> 00:38:56.739
Great anger is very good.

00:38:56.739 --> 00:39:00.739
Let's see, he's enraged, and he's waging war with the remnant,

00:39:00.739 --> 00:39:04.739
brings out here, and those that observe the commandments of God.

00:39:04.739 --> 00:39:07.739
Anyone supporting the remnant, this is a war.

00:39:08.739 --> 00:39:11.739
And the war is, these out to somehow,

00:39:11.739 --> 00:39:17.739
cause us to break our integrity with our precious Heavenly Father.

00:39:17.739 --> 00:39:21.739
So this helps us to appreciate, even though it was long before,

00:39:21.739 --> 00:39:25.739
the thoughts here in Revelation and with Jesus taught us,

00:39:25.739 --> 00:39:29.739
in Proverbs chapter 4, it still helps us more than all else

00:39:29.739 --> 00:39:33.739
that's to be guarded, safeguard your heart,

00:39:33.739 --> 00:39:37.739
for out of it are the sources of life.

00:39:37.739 --> 00:39:42.739
So even then, the recognition that we have to safeguard our heart,

00:39:42.739 --> 00:39:46.739
and accepting the fact that our heart, our figurative heart,

00:39:46.739 --> 00:39:51.739
is treacherous, that'll safeguard our precious relationship

00:39:51.739 --> 00:39:53.739
with Jehovah God.

00:39:53.739 --> 00:39:57.739
Now to help us with that, notice what Paul wrote,

00:39:57.739 --> 00:40:02.739
very familiar verses in 2 Timothy chapter 3,

00:40:02.739 --> 00:40:07.739
and we've used this in the ministry many times,

00:40:07.739 --> 00:40:11.739
and you'd think about it as it connects with safeguarding

00:40:11.739 --> 00:40:15.739
our hearts and accepting the fact that it's treacherous,

00:40:15.739 --> 00:40:19.739
that we won't break our integrity,

00:40:19.739 --> 00:40:23.739
or allow the devil to somehow cause us to break our integrity.

00:40:23.739 --> 00:40:28.739
2 Timothy chapter 3, and you'll notice what we're emphasizing here.

00:40:28.739 --> 00:40:32.739
The fact is in verse 16, all scripture is inspired by God,

00:40:32.739 --> 00:40:35.739
but notice the benefits, so it's for teaching,

00:40:35.739 --> 00:40:38.739
it's for reproving, setting things straight.

00:40:38.739 --> 00:40:43.739
See the point here though, for disciplining and righteousness.

00:40:43.739 --> 00:40:46.739
So you think of that maybe on your Bible study,

00:40:46.739 --> 00:40:49.739
I use the Bible to discipline my Bible study,

00:40:49.739 --> 00:40:53.739
get God's thinking, and it's appropriate elders use the Scriptures

00:40:53.739 --> 00:40:55.739
to discipline.

00:40:56.739 --> 00:40:59.739
However, we want to emphasize here for you,

00:40:59.739 --> 00:41:02.739
when you're doing your personal Bible reading,

00:41:02.739 --> 00:41:06.739
many of us let the Scriptures discipline

00:41:06.739 --> 00:41:08.739
that treacherous heart.

00:41:08.739 --> 00:41:11.739
So it's a mirror when something hits you,

00:41:11.739 --> 00:41:14.739
because maybe you've had wrong thinking,

00:41:14.739 --> 00:41:16.739
there could be all sorts of things,

00:41:16.739 --> 00:41:19.739
anything that could lead us astray

00:41:19.739 --> 00:41:22.739
and cause us to break our integrity, just face the fact.

00:41:22.739 --> 00:41:24.739
It's just between you and Jehovah,

00:41:24.739 --> 00:41:29.739
you're reading it and let it discipline in righteousness.

00:41:29.739 --> 00:41:32.739
And that's what's going to enable us to protect

00:41:32.739 --> 00:41:36.739
our precious relationship with Jehovah God.

00:41:36.739 --> 00:41:38.739
So we all have to face that fact,

00:41:38.739 --> 00:41:41.739
as we mentioned, our figurative heart is treacherous,

00:41:41.739 --> 00:41:44.739
it's a traitor, but what's wonderful

00:41:44.739 --> 00:41:47.739
is we're confident Jehovah loves us.

00:41:47.739 --> 00:41:49.739
So when you made that estimation in Jeremiah,

00:41:49.739 --> 00:41:52.739
it's motivated by His love.

00:41:52.739 --> 00:41:56.739
So that helps us to protect our relationship with Him,

00:41:56.739 --> 00:41:58.739
facing that fact.

00:41:58.739 --> 00:42:00.739
That's the way it is.

00:42:00.739 --> 00:42:03.739
So indeed, we accept the fact about our figurative heart,

00:42:03.739 --> 00:42:06.739
but we're determined to protect

00:42:06.739 --> 00:42:10.739
and safeguard our precious relationship with Jehovah God.

00:42:10.739 --> 00:42:13.739
Yes, praying for Jehovah's help

00:42:13.739 --> 00:42:17.739
is an important tool in safeguarding our heart.

00:42:17.739 --> 00:42:21.739
And having a desire to protect our relationship with Jehovah

00:42:21.739 --> 00:42:25.739
is closely linked to how much we appreciate

00:42:25.739 --> 00:42:27.739
what He's done for us.

00:42:27.739 --> 00:42:30.739
Our appreciation moves us to action

00:42:30.739 --> 00:42:34.739
and strengthens our faith in Him.

00:42:34.739 --> 00:42:37.739
Such appreciation is highlighted in this month's

00:42:37.739 --> 00:42:41.739
music video, which is entitled, thankful.

00:42:41.739 --> 00:43:01.449
The lines grow in mountains in the distance,

00:43:01.449 --> 00:43:03.449
wind blowing through the fields,

00:43:03.449 --> 00:43:10.559
hope the sun cast them down from the sky.

00:43:10.559 --> 00:43:14.559
Birds fly up above clouds rolling by.

00:43:14.559 --> 00:43:16.559
What did I do?

00:43:16.559 --> 00:43:20.539
See such pain there?

00:43:20.539 --> 00:43:24.500
And what do I do?

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:26.500
To show how much I care?

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:29.500
I gotta be thankful.

00:43:29.500 --> 00:45:23.019
Tell Jehovah God.

00:45:23.019 --> 00:46:44.659
Did you notice one way of expressing our gratitude to Jehovah?

00:46:44.659 --> 00:46:47.659
Yes, by means of prayer.

00:46:47.659 --> 00:46:50.659
Having that channel to the sovereign of the universe

00:46:50.659 --> 00:46:54.659
is a benefit of being His people.

00:46:54.659 --> 00:46:58.659
And speaking of being Jehovah's people,

00:46:58.659 --> 00:47:00.659
in last month's program,

00:47:00.659 --> 00:47:03.659
we had an opportunity to visit one of the museums

00:47:03.659 --> 00:47:07.659
at World Headquarters in Warwick, New York.

00:47:07.659 --> 00:47:09.659
But there's more to see.

00:47:09.659 --> 00:47:11.659
Let's join Brother John Akron,

00:47:11.659 --> 00:47:15.659
a helper to the coordinators committee on another visit.

00:47:15.659 --> 00:47:19.659
And this time, we'll stop by a museum called

00:47:19.659 --> 00:47:27.550
a People for Jehovah's Name.

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:30.550
Do you enjoy a good story?

00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:33.550
If so, you're in for a special treat.

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:35.550
A people for Jehovah's Name

00:47:35.550 --> 00:47:37.550
at World Headquarters in Warwick

00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:40.550
is more than a history museum.

00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:43.550
It's the modern-day story of a people seeking

00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:46.550
to know the true God and to do His will.

00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:49.550
But this isn't just any story.

00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:51.550
It's our story.

00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:55.829
So let's take a thrilling journey back in time.

00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:58.829
The story unfolds on the narrative wall

00:47:58.829 --> 00:48:01.829
and in several galleries along the way.

00:48:01.829 --> 00:48:03.829
We begin in the 1870s,

00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:06.829
when a small group in Allegheny, Pennsylvania

00:48:06.829 --> 00:48:09.829
decided to re-examine the Bible.

00:48:09.829 --> 00:48:11.829
As C.T. Russell reasoned,

00:48:11.829 --> 00:48:13.829
all the creeds of Christendom

00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:15.829
claim to be founded on the Bible.

00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:17.829
And these are conflicting.

00:48:17.829 --> 00:48:19.829
Is it possible that the Bible

00:48:19.829 --> 00:48:22.829
has been misrepresented?

00:48:22.829 --> 00:48:25.829
The more they learned, the more they wanted to share.

00:48:25.829 --> 00:48:27.829
So in 1879,

00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:30.829
they began publishing Zion's Watchtower.

00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:33.829
Readers were soon taking a stand

00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:36.829
for the truths that they were learning.

00:48:36.829 --> 00:48:37.829
Listen.

00:48:37.829 --> 00:48:40.829
What I want to tell you is this.

00:48:40.829 --> 00:48:42.829
I am free.

00:48:42.829 --> 00:48:45.829
The truth has made me free.

00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:49.829
Today, I was excluded from the Baptist Church.

00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:52.829
So I am all alone in the flesh,

00:48:52.829 --> 00:48:55.829
but not in the spirit.

00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:58.829
They became known as the Bible students.

00:48:58.829 --> 00:49:00.829
And they soon realized that people

00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:03.829
everywhere should hear the good news.

00:49:03.829 --> 00:49:05.829
But how could this small group

00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:07.829
preach the Bible's message,

00:49:07.829 --> 00:49:09.829
Earthwide?

00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:12.829
Transcontinental and international tours

00:49:12.829 --> 00:49:15.829
helped them to see how they could expand

00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:17.829
their preaching work even further.

00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:21.829
In just one tour, beginning in December 1911,

00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:24.829
C.T. Russell and his associates

00:49:24.829 --> 00:49:27.829
traveled completely around the world.

00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:29.829
Let's imagine what it was like

00:49:29.829 --> 00:49:33.829
to live in those exciting times.

00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:35.829
In this gallery, you can experience

00:49:35.829 --> 00:49:38.829
what life was like for Pilgrim,

00:49:38.829 --> 00:49:41.829
or what we today call a circuit overseer.

00:49:41.829 --> 00:49:43.829
Here's a Pilgrim's formal jacket

00:49:43.829 --> 00:49:47.829
that he'd wear when giving a public talk.

00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:49.829
The Bible students offered the studies

00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:51.829
in the scriptures series in the ministry,

00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:53.829
and they carried lists to locate

00:49:53.829 --> 00:49:57.829
and visit Watchtower subscribers.

00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:59.829
Then in 1914,

00:49:59.829 --> 00:50:03.829
they presented the exciting photo drama of creation.

00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:06.829
Its purpose was to build faith in the Bible

00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:09.829
as God's inspired word.

00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:12.829
It was an innovative combination of

00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:15.829
moving pictures, sound recordings,

00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:19.829
and beautiful hand-colored glass slides.

00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:23.829
Hundreds of people reenacted Bible scenes.

00:50:23.829 --> 00:50:26.829
Some with live animals.

00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:31.829
Was this enormous work worth all the effort?

00:50:31.829 --> 00:50:33.829
Dear Brother Russell,

00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:36.829
I want to thank you so much

00:50:36.829 --> 00:50:41.829
for the privilege of seeing the photo drama of creation.

00:50:41.829 --> 00:50:43.829
I had never thought to live to see

00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:45.829
the everlasting gospel preach to those

00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:47.829
who dwell on the earth,

00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:49.829
yet so it is.

00:50:49.829 --> 00:50:52.829
Words cannot tell you how my heart rejoices.

00:50:52.829 --> 00:50:55.829
Your sister, F.E. Riley.

00:50:55.829 --> 00:50:57.829
By the end of 1914,

00:50:57.829 --> 00:51:01.829
over nine million had viewed it.

00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:03.829
But with such success,

00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:05.829
the Bible students didn't realize

00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:14.050
what tests lay ahead.

00:51:14.050 --> 00:51:17.050
The Gentile times have ended.

00:51:17.050 --> 00:51:20.050
Their kings have had their day.

00:51:20.050 --> 00:51:26.829
So we know not what awaits us.

00:51:26.829 --> 00:51:29.829
World War I broke out in 1914.

00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:32.829
Then in 1916, the death of C.T. Russell

00:51:32.829 --> 00:51:35.829
left the Bible students in shock.

00:51:35.829 --> 00:51:39.829
It was a unique time of testing.

00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:41.829
Inside the organization,

00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:44.829
some struggled over who should take the lead.

00:51:44.829 --> 00:51:47.829
Outside, governments tried to force them

00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:50.829
to take sides in the war.

00:51:50.829 --> 00:51:52.829
Then, in 1918,

00:51:52.829 --> 00:51:54.829
Jeff Rutherford and seven of his

00:51:54.829 --> 00:51:58.829
close associates were imprisoned.

00:51:58.829 --> 00:52:01.829
Was this the end for the Bible students?

00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:04.829
Or would they prove to be a people

00:52:04.829 --> 00:52:07.829
for Jehovah's name?

00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:10.829
The joy that came with the release of our brothers

00:52:10.829 --> 00:52:13.829
from the Atlanta Federal Prison on Tuesday,

00:52:13.829 --> 00:52:17.829
March 25, 1919, knew no bounds.

00:52:17.829 --> 00:52:20.829
Their further devotion to Jehovah

00:52:20.829 --> 00:52:22.829
was shown in the fact that they immediately

00:52:22.829 --> 00:52:24.829
set to work to herald forth

00:52:24.829 --> 00:52:26.829
to the people of God everywhere

00:52:26.829 --> 00:52:29.829
the knowledge of Jehovah's deliverance,

00:52:29.829 --> 00:52:31.829
Thomas Sullivan.

00:52:31.829 --> 00:52:35.829
The Bible students moved forward with renewed zeal,

00:52:35.829 --> 00:52:42.039
but the opposition didn't end there.

00:52:42.039 --> 00:52:45.039
In this gallery, you will see how our brothers and sisters

00:52:45.039 --> 00:52:48.039
have stood firm for their faith.

00:52:48.039 --> 00:52:52.039
In Russia, a father imprisoned for ten years

00:52:52.039 --> 00:52:57.039
encouraged his young daughters with hand-drawn postcards.

00:52:57.039 --> 00:53:01.039
In Greece, a son used the same blanket in prison

00:53:01.039 --> 00:53:05.039
that his father used when imprisoned before him.

00:53:05.039 --> 00:53:09.039
It was an encouraging reminder of his father's integrity.

00:53:09.039 --> 00:53:13.039
In Korea, witnesses were locked in tiny cells

00:53:13.039 --> 00:53:17.039
for up to 30 days at a time.

00:53:17.039 --> 00:53:19.039
When you stand in the lighted outline,

00:53:19.039 --> 00:53:23.039
you get a sense of what it was like.

00:53:23.039 --> 00:53:25.039
All of these brothers and sisters

00:53:25.039 --> 00:53:28.039
look beyond the prison bars

00:53:28.039 --> 00:53:32.929
to their firm hope for the future.

00:53:32.929 --> 00:53:34.929
As light from God's word increased,

00:53:34.929 --> 00:53:37.929
the Bible students humbly let go of cherished

00:53:37.929 --> 00:53:40.929
but unscriptural traditions.

00:53:40.929 --> 00:53:42.929
Songs used in worship were examined

00:53:42.929 --> 00:53:45.929
in the light of what the Bible taught.

00:53:45.929 --> 00:53:47.929
The people for Jehovah's name

00:53:47.929 --> 00:53:50.929
were becoming even more evident.

00:53:50.929 --> 00:53:53.929
So in 1931, they were thrilled

00:53:53.929 --> 00:53:58.929
to take on their new name Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:53:58.929 --> 00:54:01.929
Then in 1935, Brother Rutherford identified

00:54:01.929 --> 00:54:04.929
the great multitude of other sheep

00:54:04.929 --> 00:54:07.929
who served alongside the anointed.

00:54:07.929 --> 00:54:10.929
At the climax of his talk, he asked,

00:54:10.929 --> 00:54:12.929
Will all those who have the hope

00:54:12.929 --> 00:54:16.929
of living forever on the earth please stand?

00:54:16.929 --> 00:54:18.929
With this new understanding,

00:54:18.929 --> 00:54:21.929
they saw the true scope of Jesus' commission

00:54:21.929 --> 00:54:23.929
to make disciples.

00:54:23.929 --> 00:54:26.929
New and innovative methods were needed.

00:54:26.929 --> 00:54:31.300
Our third gallery shows the preaching methods

00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:35.300
used in the 1930s and 1940s.

00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:37.300
Radio was a powerful way

00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:42.300
to spread the kingdom message to large audiences.

00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:44.300
They also used large funnagrass

00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:47.300
called portable transcription machines

00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:51.300
with loudspeakers mounted on sound cars.

00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:53.300
Brothers played recorded talks

00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:56.300
wherever people gathered.

00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:59.300
Lighter funnagrass were also designed and produced,

00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:02.300
so publishers could take the recorded message

00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:05.300
directly to people at home.

00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:08.300
These methods helped bring unity to the message,

00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:10.300
but the time had come

00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:13.300
to train each one of Jehovah's people

00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:16.300
to be an effective witness.

00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:18.300
Schools were started.

00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:20.300
The course in theocratic ministry

00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:23.300
trained publishers in the congregation,

00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:25.300
and the Bible School of Gilead

00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:29.300
began training missionaries for global expansion.

00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:34.300
We had entered into a new era of divine education,

00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:40.300
and we were about to receive an amazing tool.

00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:43.300
In 1950, we received the New World translation

00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:45.300
of the Christian Greek scriptures,

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:49.300
and by 1961, the complete Bible was released.

00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:52.300
Since then, we've seen our tools continue to improve

00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:55.300
with the wise use of modern technology.

00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:57.300
From high speed printing,

00:55:57.300 --> 00:55:59.300
to the internet and video,

00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:02.300
these methods help us to stay unified,

00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:04.300
reach millions with the good news,

00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:06.300
and glorify God.

00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:10.300
Yes, this museum's story is about people,

00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:12.300
but not just any people.

00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:15.300
We are a people for Jehovah's name.

00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:17.300
Only one question remains,

00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:21.300
what will you contribute to this wonderful story?

00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:24.579
This month, after discussing the theme,

00:56:24.579 --> 00:56:27.579
cherish your privilege of prayer,

00:56:27.579 --> 00:56:31.579
we saw how we should act when we encounter spiritism.

00:56:31.579 --> 00:56:34.579
When counteracting wicked spirits,

00:56:34.579 --> 00:56:39.579
praying for Jehovah's guidance is very important.

00:56:39.579 --> 00:56:43.579
Next, Brother Maurice showed us the importance of praying

00:56:43.579 --> 00:56:46.579
to protect our heart.

00:56:47.579 --> 00:56:50.579
And the music video reminded us of not forgetting

00:56:50.579 --> 00:56:55.579
to thank Jehovah for everything he's given us.

00:56:55.579 --> 00:56:58.579
The provision of communicating with Jehovah

00:56:58.579 --> 00:57:01.579
is a privilege we have of being his people.

00:57:01.579 --> 00:57:04.579
A visit to Warwick Bethel showed us how Jehovah

00:57:04.579 --> 00:57:08.579
has guided his people in modern times.

00:57:08.579 --> 00:57:10.579
Before we conclude,

00:57:10.579 --> 00:57:13.579
we'll visit the remote translation office

00:57:13.579 --> 00:57:17.579
in Chinley, Arizona in the United States.

00:57:17.579 --> 00:57:21.579
Located in the southwestern part of the country,

00:57:21.579 --> 00:57:26.579
the region is home to many native peoples and tribes.

00:57:26.579 --> 00:57:30.579
European settlers arrived in the 1500s.

00:57:30.579 --> 00:57:33.579
Throughout the many years since then,

00:57:33.579 --> 00:57:38.579
many of the tribes were able to retain their culture and language.

00:57:38.579 --> 00:57:41.579
Currently, the United States branch

00:57:41.579 --> 00:57:44.579
translates into several indigenous languages,

00:57:44.579 --> 00:57:50.579
including Cherokee, Hopi, Lakota, and Navajo.

00:57:50.579 --> 00:57:53.579
To help with that work, in 2015,

00:57:53.579 --> 00:57:57.579
a remote translation office, or RTO,

00:57:57.579 --> 00:58:02.579
was built in Chinley, which is in the heart of the Navajo Nation.

00:58:02.579 --> 00:58:07.579
Over 100 volunteers, of which 13 are full-time servants,

00:58:07.579 --> 00:58:10.579
work at the RTO.

00:58:10.579 --> 00:58:15.579
The Navajo field has over 430 publishers,

00:58:15.579 --> 00:58:19.579
including approximately 130 regular pioneers,

00:58:19.579 --> 00:58:23.579
and some 20 special pioneers.

00:58:23.579 --> 00:58:27.579
The literature, videos, and audio publications

00:58:27.579 --> 00:58:33.579
translated at the RTO are distributed to eight Navajo congregations,

00:58:33.579 --> 00:58:37.579
11 groups, and five pre-groups.

00:58:37.579 --> 00:58:41.579
For the past five years, three-day regional conventions

00:58:41.579 --> 00:58:44.579
have been held in the Navajo language.

00:58:44.579 --> 00:58:51.579
In 2018, they had a peak attendance of 471 with one baptized.

00:58:51.579 --> 00:58:54.579
The volunteers at the RTO in Chinley

00:58:54.579 --> 00:58:58.579
send their warm, Christian love to all of us around the world,

00:58:58.579 --> 00:59:01.579
and we love them dearly.

00:59:01.579 --> 00:59:04.579
This is J. W. Broadcasting,

00:59:04.579 --> 00:59:08.579
from the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses.
