00:00:02.819 --> 00:00:06.620
Welcome to another edition of JW Broadcasting.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.939
Here are this month's highlights.

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:10.820
What is it like to engage in the special

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.140
metropolitan witnessing work in the bustling

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.339
United States city of San Francisco?

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:18.059
We'll hear encouraging experiences

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:19.980
from brothers and sisters who preach

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.859
in this diverse language field.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.460
And young ones serve Jehovah successfully,

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.059
even if their family spiritual activity stops.

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:31.699
We'll hear from a sister who tells what kept her love

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.060
for Jehovah growing, brought her family's

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.979
busy show business career, and we'll discuss

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:41.060
the beautiful quality of loyalty,

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.259
including an interview with a couple

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:47.460
who has served Jehovah loyally for over 60 years.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:01:11.780
All ahead, I'm JW Broadcasting for August 2016.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.019
This month's theme is taken from David's poetic song

00:01:15.019 --> 00:01:19.019
to Jehovah at Psalm 1825, which states,

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.019
with someone loyal, you act in loyalty.

00:01:23.019 --> 00:01:25.939
The Hebrew term act in loyalty reminds us

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.060
of God's loyal love that is love motivated

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.060
by commitment, integrity, loyalty, and deep attachment.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.579
So loyalty is more than just a feeling.

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.620
It is active, it's rooted in love.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.939
How comforting it is to know that Jehovah

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.859
lovingly attaches himself to those who are loyal to him.

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.459
What motivated David to write the words at Psalm 1825?

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:54.980
The superscription reveals that it was composed

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.939
after Jehovah rescued him from the hand of all his enemies

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:00.500
and from the hand of Saul.

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.659
Think of the great joy and relief he must have felt

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.739
after experiencing firsthand Jehovah's loyal love

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:09.539
and mighty saving acts.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.620
However, throughout his life, David experienced

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.500
disloyalty at its worst.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.060
From his king Saul, from his wife Michael,

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.620
from his trusted counselor, Ahithofel,

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.139
and from his son, Absalom.

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:26.900
He felt the deep hurt of betrayal

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.099
by those he trusted and loved most.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.979
Loyalty is a choice.

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:36.460
What do we find when we look back at David's life?

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.419
David chose to stay loyal to God.

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:43.259
From a humble shepherd boy carrying for his sheep

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:46.139
to a valiant king carrying for the nation,

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.740
he proved to be someone loyal,

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.740
a man agreeable to Jehovah's heart.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.180
But it can be a real test to maintain loyalty to God

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.780
when we face injustices.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.300
Imagine the desperate situation that David

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.180
and his mighty warriors experienced

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.780
when they were fugitives, forced to hide in the wilderness,

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.060
often low on provisions.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.139
They saw firsthand King Saul's jealous rage.

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:13.939
But what choice did David make

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.780
when urged by his men to seize the opportunity

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.099
to take Saul's life?

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:24.300
Notice what David told his men at first Samuel 24 and verse six.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.219
It is unthinkable from Jehovah's standpoint

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:30.780
that I should do such a thing to my Lord,

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.659
the anointed of Jehovah,

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:34.699
by lifting my hand against him

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:38.099
for he is the anointed of Jehovah.

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.099
David knew that if he remained loyal,

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.740
Jehovah would remain loyal to him.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.099
He would show him loyal love.

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.460
He humbly put aside his personal feelings

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.620
and viewed matters from Jehovah's perspective.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.139
He chose to wait patiently for Jehovah to act in loyalty.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.580
We'll soon be facing life-changing events

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.099
for told in the Bible

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:06.780
that will test our loyalty to Jehovah and his organization.

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:09.900
So now is the time to strengthen our loyalty.

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:13.259
As we do, we can be sure that Jehovah

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:15.259
knows our circumstances,

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:18.100
perhaps injustices we have experienced

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.740
and will reward our loyal service.

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:23.300
So ask yourself,

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.300
what loyal actions will motivate Jehovah to be loyal to me?

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.060
Let's consider three areas.

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:35.259
First, we can be loyal to Jehovah by defending him.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.500
But Jehovah is a sovereign of the universe.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.300
How can we come to his defense?

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.459
We can learn how from the fine example of a lie-hoo.

00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:48.139
In the book of Job, a lie-hoo listened patiently

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.139
as Job and his three false confidors spoke.

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:56.139
Notice a lie-hoo's reaction at Job 32 versus 2 and 3.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.699
His anger blazed against Job

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.740
for trying to prove himself right rather than God.

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:06.740
He was also very angry with Job's three companions

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.300
because they could not find an answer

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.139
but had declared God wicked.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.899
A fire of righteous indignation

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:17.500
was burning inside young a lie-hoo.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.939
In Job 36 versus 2 and 3,

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:24.699
he lorally comes to Jehovah's defense saying,

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:28.420
be patient with me a little longer while I explain

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.860
for I still have words to speak on God's behalf.

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:35.180
I will speak comprehensively about what I know

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.180
and I will ascribe righteousness to my maker.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.579
A lie-hoo courageously proved loyal by praising

00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:44.939
and yes, defending God.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.980
Why do we need to come to Jehovah's defense today?

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.339
Because our loving Heavenly Father is blasphemed

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:55.300
in so many ways, false religions claim

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.899
that he's part of a Trinity

00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:59.939
and that he torments people eternally in burning hell.

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:02.819
Others say that he does not exist

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:06.339
or if he does, he doesn't really care about us.

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:09.300
We know that such lies come from Satan the devil.

00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:13.019
We demonstrate our loyalty by speaking

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:15.220
in defense of Jehovah,

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.379
thereby proving Satan the liar that he is.

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:20.819
We boldly and zealously proclaim

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:23.740
that he does exist as the Almighty God

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.139
and that he is wise, just and loving

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:29.860
and that he will soon bring an end to all evil

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.500
and reward his loyal ones with eternal life.

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:36.379
Jehovah could make the stones cry out in defense,

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:39.300
yet he honors his loyal witnesses,

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.980
you and me with this fine privilege.

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:46.060
Second, we can be loyal to Jehovah

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.220
by being loyal to the faithful and discreet slave,

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.300
the governing body.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.379
Jehovah and Jesus are using the faithful

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:55.899
and discreet slave to feed us spiritually.

00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:59.620
So we owe our loyalty to that slave.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.100
But some may say, isn't the governing body

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.379
made up of imperfect men?

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:06.180
Yes, it is.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.259
The last perfect person to walk the earth was Jesus himself.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.740
There is no perfect person or organization on the globe.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.259
But as a long time faithful brother used to say,

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:20.379
this is the best imperfect organization on earth.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.139
Jesus didn't say the slave would be infallible.

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:28.259
He said it would be faithful and discreet.

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:31.220
The way we listen to and obey the faithful slave

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.459
has a direct bearing on the strength of our friendship

00:07:34.459 --> 00:07:35.860
with God.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.660
In fact, it means our very life.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.459
But what if the governing body serves some spiritual food

00:07:43.459 --> 00:07:45.259
that is not to our liking?

00:07:45.259 --> 00:07:49.060
Or what if we do not fully understand or agree

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.500
with a clarification of a belief?

00:07:52.379 --> 00:07:54.579
On one occasion, Jesus followers,

00:07:54.579 --> 00:07:58.100
including the Apostle Peter, were confronted with a new teaching.

00:07:58.899 --> 00:08:01.019
How did most react?

00:08:01.019 --> 00:08:04.060
Notice John 6 and verse 60.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.980
It states, when they heard this,

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.699
many of his disciples said,

00:08:08.699 --> 00:08:10.339
this speech is shocking.

00:08:10.339 --> 00:08:12.300
Who can listen to it?

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.560
The result?

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.459
Continuing in verse 66, because of this,

00:08:17.459 --> 00:08:20.620
many of his disciples went off to the things behind

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.420
and would no longer walk with him.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:27.420
But how did Peter respond when Jesus asked them,

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.339
are you too stumbled?

00:08:29.339 --> 00:08:32.100
At John 6, 68, we read,

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.139
Simon Peter answered him,

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:37.019
Lord, whom shall we go away to?

00:08:37.019 --> 00:08:39.779
You have sayings of everlasting life.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.100
What loyalty?

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.820
Peter's loyalty was based on solid evidence

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.539
that Jesus was the Messiah.

00:08:48.539 --> 00:08:51.779
His loyalty was evidence of his faith.

00:08:51.779 --> 00:08:55.779
That is the kind of loyalty we want to imitate today.

00:08:56.779 --> 00:09:00.779
There are times we must wait on Jehovah to clarify matters.

00:09:00.779 --> 00:09:05.580
In the meantime, may we prove ourselves loyal, like Peter,

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.779
and follow closely the lead of the faithful slave,

00:09:08.779 --> 00:09:13.379
who closely follow in the footsteps of their master, Jesus.

00:09:14.379 --> 00:09:18.379
At times, though, we receive counsel that touches us personally.

00:09:18.379 --> 00:09:20.779
For instance, on JW Broadcasting,

00:09:20.779 --> 00:09:23.980
we receive loving reminders from members of the governing body

00:09:24.179 --> 00:09:26.100
to be forgiving,

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.620
to honor Jehovah with our valuable things,

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.820
and to remain spiritually alert.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.299
Through the watchtower and at Christian meetings,

00:09:34.299 --> 00:09:37.299
we're reminded to be careful about our address and grooming,

00:09:37.299 --> 00:09:40.899
to choose good associates and wholesome entertainment,

00:09:40.899 --> 00:09:42.779
and to remain morally clean.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.940
Are we quick to respond and make needed adjustments?

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:51.299
Or do we find ourselves wanting to defend our personal rights?

00:09:52.299 --> 00:09:56.019
A situation in the Apostle Paul's life tested his loyalty

00:09:56.019 --> 00:09:57.899
to theocratic direction?

00:09:57.899 --> 00:10:01.139
It's found in Acts chapter 21.

00:10:01.139 --> 00:10:04.740
As you recall, Paul arrived in Jerusalem in 56 CE

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.419
after a very successful missionary tour.

00:10:07.419 --> 00:10:10.860
You can imagine his excitement as he related in detail

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.700
that things God did among the nations through his ministry.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.860
After hearing Paul's extraordinary account,

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.340
the older men revealed to Paul a problem in Judea

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:24.220
that involved him personally.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:28.220
Read what they said at Acts 21 and verse 21.

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.500
But they, the Jewish believers,

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.139
have heard it rumored about you,

00:10:33.139 --> 00:10:36.179
that you have been teaching all the Jews among the nations

00:10:36.179 --> 00:10:39.340
in a apostasy from Moses,

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.779
telling them not to circumcise their children,

00:10:41.779 --> 00:10:44.139
or to follow the customary practices.

00:10:45.139 --> 00:10:48.980
Well, perhaps Paul thought me in a apostate?

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:49.820
Really?

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.539
How can they say such a thing?

00:10:51.539 --> 00:10:53.980
I just finished my third missionary tour

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:56.980
and look how Jehovah blessed the work.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.940
Nevertheless, the older men gave Paul very clear direction

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.259
at Acts 21, verses 23 and 24,

00:11:04.259 --> 00:11:07.059
that he likely did not anticipate.

00:11:07.059 --> 00:11:07.980
And there it reads,

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.659
so do what we tell you.

00:11:10.659 --> 00:11:14.019
We have four men who have put themselves under a vow.

00:11:14.019 --> 00:11:16.899
Take these men with you and cleanse yourself ceremonially

00:11:16.899 --> 00:11:19.700
together with them and take care of their expenses

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:21.779
so that they may have their head shaved.

00:11:21.779 --> 00:11:24.019
Then everyone will know that there is nothing

00:11:24.019 --> 00:11:26.179
to the rumors they were told about you,

00:11:26.179 --> 00:11:28.620
but that you are walking orderly

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.539
and you are also keeping the law.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.539
Was this the time for Paul to question their decision

00:11:34.539 --> 00:11:36.139
or demand his rights?

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.860
He could have reason,

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.740
didn't you read my letter to the Galatians

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.340
where it says the law was nailed to the torture stake

00:11:43.379 --> 00:11:44.980
with Jesus?

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.460
I did nothing wrong.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.860
Why do I have to put on this pretense

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.899
just because a few are overly sensitive?

00:11:51.899 --> 00:11:55.379
No, he humbly did as they requested,

00:11:55.379 --> 00:11:57.340
although it nearly cost him his life.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.740
Yes, it meant swallowing his pride,

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.220
but Paul knew there were bigger issues involved

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.460
than his personal rights.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.340
He was considerate of the consciences of others.

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:10.860
But more importantly,

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:14.899
he showed his loyalty to Jehovah and to the governing body.

00:12:16.019 --> 00:12:18.820
Do we see the bigger issue in our life?

00:12:19.779 --> 00:12:23.620
Let us be determined to be humble, flexible,

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.659
and obedient like Paul,

00:12:25.659 --> 00:12:28.700
and thereby prove ourselves faithful

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:31.100
to the faithful and discrete slave.

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.659
Third, we can be loyal to Jehovah

00:12:35.659 --> 00:12:38.019
by being loyal to the elders.

00:12:38.019 --> 00:12:40.500
We've discussed loyalty to Jehovah himself

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:41.980
and to the faithful slave,

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.940
but what about direction we receive

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.220
from the elders in our congregation?

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.700
We listen to our elders give talks and comments

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.379
at the meetings each week.

00:12:51.379 --> 00:12:53.179
We work with them in the ministry

00:12:53.179 --> 00:12:55.340
and we associate with them.

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.899
This regular contact gives us more opportunities

00:12:57.899 --> 00:13:01.100
to see their imperfections and flaws.

00:13:02.019 --> 00:13:05.299
We couldn't begin to focus on their weaknesses,

00:13:05.299 --> 00:13:07.700
weakening our trust in God's arrangement.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:12.299
For example, if you zoom in on any of our pictures

00:13:12.299 --> 00:13:13.740
in our magazines,

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:17.220
all you'll see are colored spots or pixels.

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.019
But when you zoom out,

00:13:19.019 --> 00:13:21.659
you see a beautiful photo or painting.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.379
Similarly, when looking at our elders,

00:13:25.379 --> 00:13:27.700
don't zoom in on their imperfections,

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.059
the spots of ink,

00:13:29.059 --> 00:13:31.539
rather see the big picture.

00:13:33.059 --> 00:13:35.940
Why then is it so important to strengthen our loyalty

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.419
to our hardworking, loving shepherds?

00:13:38.419 --> 00:13:40.299
Because these gifts and men

00:13:40.299 --> 00:13:43.419
aren't expression of Jehovah's loyal love

00:13:43.419 --> 00:13:46.100
as they loyalty lead, feed,

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.860
and protect his precious sheep.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.419
As the great tribulation nears,

00:13:50.419 --> 00:13:51.820
our survival will depend

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:54.580
and our readiness to respond to their direction

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:57.139
as they follow the governing body's direction.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.580
Our loyalty is not to men,

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:03.820
but to Jehovah's arrangement made up of imperfect,

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:04.940
but loyal men.

00:14:05.899 --> 00:14:07.779
That is a lesson that Korah,

00:14:07.779 --> 00:14:11.620
Nathan, and a Byron refuse to learn.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:13.000
In this clip from the video

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.899
Respect Jehovah's Authority,

00:14:14.899 --> 00:14:18.100
listen to Korah's defiant attitude toward Moses

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.740
as taken from Numbers chapter 16.

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:29.990
That is enough of you

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:34.830
because the whole assembly are all of them holy

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:37.070
and Jehovah's in their midst.

00:14:38.309 --> 00:14:40.470
Why then should you lift yourselves up

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:42.909
above the congregation of Jehovah?

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:47.029
Korah and the others made great pretenses

00:14:47.029 --> 00:14:48.590
of loyalty to God,

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:50.950
but completely ignored the fact

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:53.950
that Jehovah directly appointed Moses and Aaron.

00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:58.990
Who then were they really murmuring against?

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:02.230
Notice Numbers chapter 26 verse 9.

00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:06.870
This Nathan and a Byron were chosen ones of the assembly

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.549
who fought against Moses and Aaron

00:15:08.549 --> 00:15:10.269
along with Korah's group

00:15:10.309 --> 00:15:14.309
when they fought against Jehovah.

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:19.389
While focusing on the man Moses and his imperfections,

00:15:19.389 --> 00:15:22.190
they did not really see that it was Jehovah

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.230
who was directing the nation.

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:27.750
They were actually fighting against Jehovah.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:29.909
Their disloyalty to God's appointed men

00:15:29.909 --> 00:15:32.070
cost them their lives,

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:35.029
but Korah's sons made a different choice.

00:15:35.029 --> 00:15:36.269
In this next clip,

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:39.149
notice an attitude far different from their fathers.

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:42.629
My father and his companions

00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:45.950
actually rebelled against Jehovah's authority.

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:49.149
Their envy, pride, and ambition led to rebellion,

00:15:49.149 --> 00:15:50.269
and in the end,

00:15:50.269 --> 00:15:52.230
they brought this honor upon themselves.

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:55.350
My father saw glory,

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:56.870
but his glory was short-lived.

00:15:58.110 --> 00:15:59.950
I'm glad though that my brothers and I

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:01.549
took the right side of the issue.

00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:05.429
It must have been hard though.

00:16:05.429 --> 00:16:07.549
Yes, it was,

00:16:07.549 --> 00:16:10.909
but that helps us to understand how important it is

00:16:10.909 --> 00:16:14.110
that we not allow friendships or family

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:17.269
to take priority over our relationship with Jehovah

00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:18.669
and our obedience to him.

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:22.509
That's what fathers always told me.

00:16:22.509 --> 00:16:25.710
Yes, ultimately,

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:29.509
successful direction for us humans comes from Jehovah.

00:16:30.509 --> 00:16:33.830
We should trust completely in his choices of appointed ones.

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:35.950
You see,

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:38.909
respect for those whom Jehovah has appointed

00:16:38.909 --> 00:16:41.509
shows respect for Jehovah's authority.

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.669
The loyalty displayed by Korah's sons

00:16:45.669 --> 00:16:50.350
moved Jehovah to act in loyalty by sparing their lives.

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:53.629
What fine examples for us to imitate?

00:16:53.629 --> 00:16:56.830
May we never find ourselves fighting against Jehovah

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:58.950
by murmuring or complaining against

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:02.830
those who he has appointed to lead his people today.

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.309
To see more of the good and the bad examples

00:17:05.309 --> 00:17:07.509
of loyalty among the Israelites,

00:17:07.509 --> 00:17:09.430
we encourage you to watch the entire

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:13.230
respect Jehovah's Authority video on JW Broadcasting.

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:15.670
In review,

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:18.710
how can we show our loyalty to Jehovah?

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:22.869
First, by coming to his defense as his witnesses.

00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:25.630
Second, by maintaining our loyal support

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:27.990
of the faithful and discreet slave.

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:30.710
And third, by a lowly following direction

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:32.190
from the appointed elders.

00:17:33.109 --> 00:17:35.390
As you imitate faithful examples,

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:37.190
like the sons of Korah,

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:39.750
like David, Peter and Paul,

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:42.990
you will prove to be somewhat Jehovah views as loyal,

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:48.980
worthy of receiving his acts of loyalty forever.

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:51.619
Our second point on loyalty shows us ways

00:17:51.619 --> 00:17:55.059
we can follow the faithful and discreet slaves direction.

00:17:55.059 --> 00:17:57.299
But have you ever wondered how the governing body

00:17:57.299 --> 00:17:59.740
arrives at important decisions?

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.220
In this Bethlehem morning worship,

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:03.859
Brother David's explain answers that very question.

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:07.380
Well, there have been so many changes.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:08.700
It's hard to keep up.

00:18:10.099 --> 00:18:11.740
We hear that a lot.

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:13.460
It is true.

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:14.980
So the question is,

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.059
how did these changes come about?

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.779
Does the governing body get together

00:18:19.779 --> 00:18:21.500
on a Wednesday morning and say,

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.859
well, what will we change this week?

00:18:23.859 --> 00:18:26.740
Let's throw the brotherhood off a guard a little bit.

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:31.339
That would not be faithful or discreet.

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:36.059
The fact is that although changes may seem to be announced

00:18:36.059 --> 00:18:37.900
one after another,

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.819
the decision to put the changes into effect

00:18:40.819 --> 00:18:43.539
is often years in the making.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.700
Now, one of the first big changes

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.940
that the current governing body had to grapple with

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.259
had to do with this.

00:18:53.259 --> 00:18:57.059
Is it feasible to have a branch committee

00:18:57.059 --> 00:18:59.259
serving in the United States?

00:19:00.299 --> 00:19:02.940
Now, for years, I thought was that

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:04.779
we really couldn't have a branch committee

00:19:04.779 --> 00:19:06.180
functioning in the United States

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:11.259
because the States was host to the governing body

00:19:11.259 --> 00:19:13.420
and the world headquarters.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:16.900
So this was going to be a big decision

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.140
and it wasn't taken overnight.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:24.420
A lot of consultation with mature, experienced brothers

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:25.980
was necessary.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.339
But finally, the decision was made

00:19:28.339 --> 00:19:32.579
and we believe that decision has had Jehovah's rich blessing.

00:19:32.579 --> 00:19:37.299
We're proud of our hard working branch committee

00:19:37.299 --> 00:19:39.380
and we're happy to have their support.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.660
We need their support.

00:19:42.819 --> 00:19:46.099
Now, let's consider a couple of other examples.

00:19:46.099 --> 00:19:49.619
Beginning of the first week of January 2009,

00:19:49.619 --> 00:19:53.380
the school service meeting and the congregation book study

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.980
were merged.

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:59.980
Now, that decision was almost 10 years in the making.

00:20:00.259 --> 00:20:05.099
As far back as 1999, it was being discussed.

00:20:05.099 --> 00:20:09.579
Well, then, why wasn't the decision made 10 years earlier?

00:20:09.579 --> 00:20:12.619
Because the governing body wanted to be sure.

00:20:12.619 --> 00:20:14.099
Will the brothers have what they need?

00:20:14.099 --> 00:20:17.380
Will they have all of the spiritual food they need

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.140
if we merge the meetings?

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.619
Now, then one Wednesday, I think it was about 330

00:20:22.619 --> 00:20:23.460
in the afternoon.

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:26.299
We'd had a long meeting.

00:20:26.299 --> 00:20:30.660
We received two letters from a large branches

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.700
and one of the branches said that they had many large

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:37.380
congregations with seven or eight book studies

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.500
but with only one elder and one ministerial servant

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.779
so the elder might conduct five book studies

00:20:42.779 --> 00:20:45.259
and the ministerial servant might conduct three

00:20:45.259 --> 00:20:47.299
and then they had all of the parts on the meetings

00:20:47.299 --> 00:20:48.660
to prepare.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:50.339
So all they were doing with their time

00:20:50.339 --> 00:20:53.779
was conducting book studies and preparing parts

00:20:53.779 --> 00:20:54.940
for the meetings.

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:55.980
It was hard.

00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:00.220
And then the same week, we received a letter from another branch

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.299
and they explained why the attendance

00:21:02.299 --> 00:21:04.740
at the book study was so low.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.299
They explained that the publishers love the meetings,

00:21:07.299 --> 00:21:10.539
all of the meetings, including the book study,

00:21:10.539 --> 00:21:15.140
but they're very poor and they couldn't afford the bus fare

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:17.940
to attend two midweek meetings.

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:19.579
They had to choose.

00:21:19.579 --> 00:21:22.380
And if they attended the school and service meeting,

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:25.579
they could get almost two hours of spiritual direction

00:21:25.579 --> 00:21:28.940
whereas with the book study they would get one.

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:31.339
So most of the time it was the school

00:21:31.339 --> 00:21:34.660
and service meeting that won out.

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:39.660
While those two letters put a real face on the situation

00:21:40.339 --> 00:21:42.779
and it helped us to make the decision.

00:21:43.779 --> 00:21:47.779
Now in 2008, a public edition and a study edition

00:21:47.779 --> 00:21:50.779
of the Watchtower began to be published.

00:21:50.779 --> 00:21:54.779
That decision was a long time coming.

00:21:54.779 --> 00:21:57.779
We discussed the possibility off and on

00:21:57.779 --> 00:21:59.779
but we always said, let's not be hasty,

00:21:59.779 --> 00:22:02.779
let's wait a little bit, let's see what Jehovah wants.

00:22:02.779 --> 00:22:06.779
The main thing was, what would Jehovah want?

00:22:06.779 --> 00:22:08.779
And how would we know?

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:12.980
We decided to make a sort of fleece test.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:17.980
And so in 2006, we began publishing one awake a month

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.500
but we kept publishing two Watchtower.

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:24.420
So that would be three magazines per month instead of four.

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:27.619
And the rationale was, we'll try it for a year.

00:22:27.619 --> 00:22:29.299
And if at the end of a year

00:22:29.299 --> 00:22:32.059
our magazine placements have plummeted,

00:22:32.059 --> 00:22:34.660
we'll know that Jehovah is not backing this arrangement.

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:38.180
We can go back to producing two awakes a year.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.019
Well, what was the result?

00:22:41.019 --> 00:22:43.339
At the end of the year, we were placing

00:22:43.339 --> 00:22:46.619
as many magazines at three per month

00:22:46.619 --> 00:22:51.059
as we had been placing at four per month the year before.

00:22:51.059 --> 00:22:55.460
So that indicated to us that Jehovah was backing the arrangement

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:58.380
and how many of us have appreciated having a study edition

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:01.660
of the Watchtower that speaks directly to the Brotherhood

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:04.299
and then a public edition of the Watchtower.

00:23:04.299 --> 00:23:06.380
That can be tailored a little bit more

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.339
to the needs of the public.

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:13.980
Now before making any decision that affects the kingdom work,

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:16.819
the governing body has to carefully consider

00:23:16.819 --> 00:23:19.180
the spiritual implications.

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:20.700
An example.

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:24.940
In 2008, the decision was made to reduce the length

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:28.940
of public talks from 45 minutes to 30 minutes.

00:23:30.059 --> 00:23:32.859
While you say how could that decision possibly affect

00:23:32.859 --> 00:23:36.259
the spirituality of the Brotherhood?

00:23:36.259 --> 00:23:39.140
And if you're serving in an urban congregation

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.019
with many elders and nearby,

00:23:41.019 --> 00:23:43.619
there are other urban congregations with many elders,

00:23:43.619 --> 00:23:47.700
perhaps you'd have difficulty in understanding the reasoning.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:51.180
But the governing body has to look at the whole picture.

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:55.220
Thousands of our brothers have served with an eduase great

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.019
and they've learned a foreign language.

00:23:57.019 --> 00:23:59.460
And in many, many of these congregations,

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:01.220
the learners are the elders.

00:24:02.019 --> 00:24:03.980
Some of the learners have told us

00:24:04.019 --> 00:24:07.420
that for every minute of a public talk,

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:10.779
it is required one hour of preparation.

00:24:10.779 --> 00:24:14.059
So can you imagine 45 minute public talk,

00:24:14.059 --> 00:24:16.619
45 hours for some of them?

00:24:16.619 --> 00:24:19.460
So the reduction in the length of the public talks

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:21.539
has actually meant that these congregations

00:24:21.539 --> 00:24:24.579
could have more public talks.

00:24:24.579 --> 00:24:25.980
That's not all.

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.859
There are thousands of elders who are serving

00:24:28.859 --> 00:24:31.980
in isolated congregations that may be 100 miles or more

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:33.299
from the next congregation.

00:24:33.299 --> 00:24:35.660
So in one congregation you have one elder

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:38.420
and then 100 miles away you have another congregation

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:39.900
with one elder.

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:43.099
How many public talks were those brothers getting

00:24:43.099 --> 00:24:45.700
when there were 45 minute public talks?

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:49.539
The 15 minute reduction made a difference.

00:24:49.539 --> 00:24:52.380
So if we take a narrow view and think only about our own

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:54.779
situation and our own congregation,

00:24:54.779 --> 00:24:57.819
well, we can have difficulty in understanding

00:24:57.819 --> 00:25:00.099
why certain decisions are made.

00:25:01.099 --> 00:25:03.779
Now the same principles apply to clarifications

00:25:03.779 --> 00:25:05.019
in our beliefs.

00:25:05.019 --> 00:25:07.619
The governing body loves to get together

00:25:07.619 --> 00:25:09.140
and discuss the Bible.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:11.180
And when those Bibles come out on the table

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:13.420
and when the brothers bring their research in

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.180
and they're starting to search the scriptures

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:16.579
and analyze the scriptures,

00:25:16.579 --> 00:25:18.819
you see the happy smiles on their faces.

00:25:18.819 --> 00:25:23.420
The brothers love discussing spiritual things.

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:27.420
But the clarifications are often

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.460
to are often a long time in coming into print.

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:31.980
Why?

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:34.180
Because the clarification on one scripture

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.740
can have a domino effect on others.

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:38.740
The clarification on one scripture

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:41.339
can have ramifications on other prophecies.

00:25:41.339 --> 00:25:45.380
So we have to be absolutely sure that everything fits.

00:25:46.299 --> 00:25:50.220
So to reiterate, although certain changes may be announced

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:51.940
one after another,

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:55.980
these decisions are thought out very carefully.

00:25:56.019 --> 00:25:58.500
And here's an interesting side point.

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:00.579
The older members of the governing body,

00:26:00.579 --> 00:26:03.059
brother Jaros, brother Barr,

00:26:03.059 --> 00:26:06.380
were just as interested in making the adjustments

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.940
as the younger members were.

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:11.140
They were very progressive.

00:26:12.299 --> 00:26:14.059
What an insight into the faithful

00:26:14.059 --> 00:26:16.779
and discrete slaves loving concern.

00:26:16.779 --> 00:26:18.700
Did you hear things the governing body does

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:19.980
that would further motivate you

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:22.460
to support and follow their direction?

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:25.579
Perhaps it's how they consulted experienced brothers

00:26:25.579 --> 00:26:27.180
or that they consider our brothers

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.819
varying circumstances worldwide.

00:26:29.819 --> 00:26:31.420
Or most importantly,

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:33.539
how they patiently and prayerfully

00:26:33.539 --> 00:26:35.140
seek to know Jehovah's will

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:37.940
and look for his blessing on a decision.

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.339
Millions of our brothers and sisters around the world

00:26:40.339 --> 00:26:42.380
can recount the blessings they've gained

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:46.339
by remaining loyal to Jehovah and his organization.

00:26:46.339 --> 00:26:49.380
And we're privileged to have two such examples here

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:50.779
with us today.

00:26:50.779 --> 00:26:54.099
Brother and sister William and Sandra Melenfant.

00:26:54.099 --> 00:26:56.859
Brother Melenfant is a helper to the teaching committee

00:26:56.859 --> 00:26:58.980
and sister Melenfant's current assignment

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.740
is in the service department.

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:02.539
And we're looking forward to hearing

00:27:02.539 --> 00:27:05.779
about their rich spiritual history.

00:27:05.779 --> 00:27:08.180
So Bill and Sandra were so happy that

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:09.900
we could have you here in the studio with us.

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:13.259
And we do look forward to learning more about you.

00:27:13.259 --> 00:27:14.779
Maybe we'd like to go back.

00:27:14.779 --> 00:27:17.140
How did you get on the road that has led you

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:21.099
to such many years of faithful loyal service to Jehovah?

00:27:21.099 --> 00:27:23.900
It was back in 1954.

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:26.819
My mother had contact on and off with the witnesses

00:27:26.819 --> 00:27:27.660
for years.

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:29.740
I was about 20 years old.

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:32.259
And she was invited to a public talk

00:27:32.259 --> 00:27:34.980
at the Oakland Central Congregation in California.

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:37.180
She asked me, would you accompany me?

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:40.539
And I said, yeah, sure, I'll be happy to go.

00:27:40.539 --> 00:27:43.819
Well, I recognized a young man I knew from high school

00:27:43.819 --> 00:27:45.779
at the meeting, and he approached me after

00:27:45.779 --> 00:27:48.619
and told me I needed a Bible study.

00:27:48.619 --> 00:27:50.140
I really didn't want a Bible study,

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:54.099
but he insisted, and so I said, well, you can come by.

00:27:54.099 --> 00:27:54.900
Would you believe it?

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:59.380
I started a Bible study in the Let God be true book.

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:01.299
Four months later, I was baptized.

00:28:01.299 --> 00:28:03.819
It was exactly what I was looking for,

00:28:03.819 --> 00:28:05.339
and I didn't realize it.

00:28:05.339 --> 00:28:05.859
Good choice.

00:28:05.859 --> 00:28:06.259
Thank you.

00:28:06.259 --> 00:28:08.420
And Sandra, you're starting the road

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.700
to a career serving Jehovah.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:12.819
Before I was born, my parents started

00:28:12.819 --> 00:28:15.220
on this search for the truth.

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:18.460
It happened because they had lost a little girl in death.

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.339
And they went from church to church,

00:28:20.339 --> 00:28:22.500
looking for some kind of comfort.

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.819
And of course, the clergy had no comfort for them.

00:28:24.819 --> 00:28:29.299
They just said, well, God wanted another angel in heaven.

00:28:29.299 --> 00:28:30.779
And that angered my father.

00:28:30.779 --> 00:28:33.259
He thought, no, if God wants another angel,

00:28:33.259 --> 00:28:34.099
he can make one.

00:28:34.099 --> 00:28:36.180
He wouldn't take my little girl.

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:39.259
So it just happened that one evening,

00:28:39.259 --> 00:28:43.339
they were listening to the radio long before TV, of course.

00:28:43.339 --> 00:28:47.619
And they heard a Jehovah's Witness give a talk.

00:28:47.619 --> 00:28:49.299
And then title of that talk was,

00:28:49.299 --> 00:28:50.819
where are the dead?

00:28:50.819 --> 00:28:51.700
Imagine.

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:53.980
He gave all the scripture proof about the condition

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:57.019
of the dead, the hope for the resurrection.

00:28:57.019 --> 00:29:01.140
And my father immediately said, this was the truth.

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:04.180
So they wrote to the radio station,

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:06.940
got a copy of the booklet of the talk.

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:09.900
And then also they started receiving

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:12.380
the subscription to the watch tower.

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:15.380
But it wasn't until I was born and three years old

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:18.099
that the witness was finally made contact with us.

00:29:18.099 --> 00:29:20.980
So what motivated you to make a choice

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:22.819
to get into the full-time service

00:29:22.819 --> 00:29:24.940
and give your life to Jehovah?

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:28.859
Well, what motivated me was when I attended a convention

00:29:28.859 --> 00:29:30.700
also in 56.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.859
I got baptized in 54.

00:29:32.859 --> 00:29:35.259
But in 56, I went to a district convention

00:29:35.259 --> 00:29:38.779
in Albany, California, and there was a pioneer booth.

00:29:38.779 --> 00:29:41.500
So I approached the booth and an older sister there

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.059
looked at me and said, your young and strong,

00:29:44.059 --> 00:29:46.099
why aren't you a pioneer?

00:29:46.099 --> 00:29:48.740
I felt, well, yes, why not?

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:51.380
So I started pioneering in 1956.

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:52.539
That's what motivated me.

00:29:52.539 --> 00:29:54.619
And I was, really, I looked back at that.

00:29:54.619 --> 00:29:57.940
It was one of the best decisions I made in my life.

00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:59.619
Sandra, how about you?

00:29:59.619 --> 00:30:02.299
Motivating to put in a full-time service.

00:30:02.299 --> 00:30:05.859
Well, for a pioneer service, you know, it was like a given.

00:30:05.859 --> 00:30:08.500
Young people were just encouraged to pioneer.

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:11.299
And most of the young people were doing that.

00:30:11.299 --> 00:30:13.460
You know, after a year or two, maybe they would get married

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:16.380
and start a family, but those years and pioneering,

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:18.339
starting out their life that way,

00:30:18.339 --> 00:30:21.700
gave them a wonderful basis for loyal service

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:23.420
the rest of their life.

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:24.539
Beautiful.

00:30:24.539 --> 00:30:26.299
So you were pioneering.

00:30:26.299 --> 00:30:29.140
How did your paths eventually meet?

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:35.380
It was at a circuit assembly in Oakland, California, 1956.

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:37.420
Very interesting things took place.

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:40.819
I had the job of dismantling the stage.

00:30:40.819 --> 00:30:44.099
And I was carrying this large piece of plywood off the stage

00:30:44.099 --> 00:30:47.339
and I ran right into Sandra and knocked her flat.

00:30:47.339 --> 00:30:49.380
Well, I took advantage of the opportunity.

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.779
I thought, well, that's not the best way to introduce yourself.

00:30:52.779 --> 00:30:55.819
But I said, by the way, would you like to accompany me

00:30:55.819 --> 00:30:58.180
to a get-together some of the friends are having it?

00:30:58.180 --> 00:30:59.059
Very good, Bill.

00:30:59.059 --> 00:31:00.900
Well, yes, and I followed through on it.

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.579
We had a lot of association.

00:31:02.579 --> 00:31:05.779
And after a number of months, we got married.

00:31:05.779 --> 00:31:07.299
And both of us were pioneering,

00:31:07.299 --> 00:31:09.779
very happy in our ministry serving Jehovah.

00:31:09.779 --> 00:31:12.220
You really swept her off her feet, literally.

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:13.220
I fell for it.

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:14.059
Very good.

00:31:14.059 --> 00:31:16.259
So shortly after you were married,

00:31:16.259 --> 00:31:18.579
I understand you received some direction.

00:31:18.579 --> 00:31:22.180
Yes, the circuit overseer visited our congregation.

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:25.579
We were only married about a month, I think, when he came through.

00:31:25.579 --> 00:31:29.740
And he told us that the organization was looking for pioneers

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:31.700
who'd be willing to serve as special pioneers

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:33.740
and go wherever where the need was great

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:36.420
in the United States, particularly.

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:39.740
So we told them, sure, we'd be delighted to do it.

00:31:39.779 --> 00:31:42.140
And four months after our marriage,

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:47.140
we received an assignment as special pioneers to Decora Ayua.

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.460
Now, that was a very interesting place

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:52.980
because there were only eight publishers in the congregation.

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:56.140
But we arrived, started with the meetings there

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:57.220
at the Kingdom Hall.

00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:59.980
And the Kingdom Hall was up above Hunts' variety store

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:04.019
in downtown Decora, and we lived in a room behind it.

00:32:04.019 --> 00:32:06.099
Well, you know, you're on your own like that,

00:32:06.099 --> 00:32:07.940
not a lot of brothers around.

00:32:08.019 --> 00:32:10.140
So you look for encouragement and company,

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:13.900
and we would travel down to Strawberry Point, Ayua

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:16.980
to where Charles and Shirley Sonnetco lived

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:19.859
in a log cabin, one room log cabin,

00:32:19.859 --> 00:32:21.579
and we'd go visit with them

00:32:21.579 --> 00:32:24.019
in order to have some mutual encouragement.

00:32:24.019 --> 00:32:26.220
It's a nice picture of you in that log cabin, too,

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:27.940
as you were special pioneering.

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:29.619
So you're busy in that work.

00:32:29.619 --> 00:32:32.380
What special invitation did you receive?

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:35.779
Well, we received the invitation to attend Gillian,

00:32:35.779 --> 00:32:38.579
the 34th class of Gillian School,

00:32:38.579 --> 00:32:40.660
and that was a wonderful thing.

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:42.420
After two and a half years of pioneering,

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:44.299
special pioneering in Ayua,

00:32:44.299 --> 00:32:46.700
and we were assigned to Lebanon,

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:48.779
but we were unable to enter Lebanon

00:32:48.779 --> 00:32:50.859
because we couldn't get the visa.

00:32:50.859 --> 00:32:52.740
So then the organization asked us,

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:55.339
well, will you take an assignment to Morocco?

00:32:55.339 --> 00:32:56.859
We were ready to go anywhere.

00:32:56.859 --> 00:32:59.660
So that's how we took a boat from New York City,

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.980
five days across the Atlantic to Casablanca.

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:03.819
Well, very nice.

00:33:03.819 --> 00:33:07.940
What was it like to be in the missionary service in Morocco?

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:09.339
It was very interesting.

00:33:09.339 --> 00:33:13.059
We really enjoyed it, but you know, we only spoke English.

00:33:13.059 --> 00:33:16.180
So in Morocco, we had to learn French,

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:20.180
and the first month of our missionary service in Morocco

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:24.700
was for 30 days you studied the language 11 hours a day.

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:27.180
Well, that could get pretty tiring for 11 hours a day,

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:28.700
so we'd go to the French movies

00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:31.019
and count that as language time.

00:33:31.019 --> 00:33:33.099
And then we were moved to Tangier,

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:35.420
and there was a Spanish congregation in Tangier,

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:38.539
and so we had to learn the Spanish language too.

00:33:38.539 --> 00:33:42.059
But that was really a rich blessing for the two of us

00:33:42.059 --> 00:33:44.019
to be exposed to that culture

00:33:44.019 --> 00:33:46.819
and to have that privilege of serving there.

00:33:46.819 --> 00:33:50.220
So after four years, I understand that you came back

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:51.299
to visit your family.

00:33:51.299 --> 00:33:54.339
What events were challenging thereafter?

00:33:54.339 --> 00:33:56.859
I think Sandra can relate that.

00:33:56.859 --> 00:33:59.660
Well, it was usually permitted

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:01.579
after you were in your assignment four years,

00:34:01.579 --> 00:34:02.859
but then you were allowed to come home

00:34:02.859 --> 00:34:05.819
at least to have a vacation, visit your family.

00:34:05.819 --> 00:34:08.099
But we got back, we visited our family,

00:34:08.099 --> 00:34:12.659
and while there, I had a medical examination

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:15.179
and found out that I had a serious health problem.

00:34:15.179 --> 00:34:17.420
Of course, we didn't have the funds to cover that,

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:19.739
so Bill wrote to the society,

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:21.300
and we made arrangements.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:24.179
They said, well, just take care of your situation

00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:26.420
and let us know when you're free.

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:30.139
So he got a job to take care of our medical needs

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:32.780
as well as living conditions.

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:36.099
But you know, we just felt like we were failures.

00:34:36.099 --> 00:34:37.739
Jehovah knew we were discouraged.

00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:40.380
He knew we felt distraught about this,

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:44.139
so he knew just what we needed and he gave it to us.

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:45.820
As I got to feeling better

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:49.820
and we got more free in our use of time,

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:53.900
we started pioneering and Jehovah blessed our ministry

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:55.619
just incredibly.

00:34:55.619 --> 00:34:59.099
There were times in this supposedly

00:34:59.099 --> 00:35:02.380
unproductive territory that we had up to 25 people

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:03.739
attending the meetings.

00:35:03.739 --> 00:35:05.300
Many of them got baptized

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.380
and there are fast friends to this day.

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:11.420
So Jehovah knows what you need and he provides it.

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.659
That is beautiful.

00:35:13.659 --> 00:35:15.780
What temptation did you have to resist

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:18.539
when you came back and going through these difficulties?

00:35:18.539 --> 00:35:20.500
Yeah, I think it's a temptation

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.780
that confronts a lot of brothers and sisters

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:25.980
who return because of health reasons.

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:29.059
And some just end up settling down

00:35:29.059 --> 00:35:30.780
because of their circumstances.

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:32.460
But the temptation there was,

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:35.139
well, you're home, you've already done your service

00:35:35.139 --> 00:35:36.980
in Morocco for a number of years.

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:38.340
You've been in the full-time ministry.

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:41.659
Just settled down now via house.

00:35:41.659 --> 00:35:44.019
But really, that wasn't our desire.

00:35:44.019 --> 00:35:46.179
So as soon as Sandra got on her feet

00:35:46.179 --> 00:35:49.099
and was feeling well enough, we got pioneering.

00:35:49.099 --> 00:35:50.739
And then I wrote headquarters and I said,

00:35:50.739 --> 00:35:53.300
here we are, we're ready to take on whatever.

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:54.980
What would you like us to do?

00:35:55.019 --> 00:35:56.860
Good example, thank you.

00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:59.579
So you made yourself available to the organization.

00:35:59.579 --> 00:36:01.500
Where did they send you next?

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:02.900
A wonderful assignment.

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:07.900
We were sent a special pioneers to Washington, DC

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:11.420
to help start a Spanish congregation.

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:14.739
And that was indeed a very rich blessing.

00:36:14.739 --> 00:36:17.019
We were there a year and a half

00:36:17.019 --> 00:36:21.420
until that little congregation was solid and was formed.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.699
And then we received another blessing.

00:36:23.699 --> 00:36:25.940
We pointed to the circuit work.

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:28.579
So I had the Spanish circuit in Florida

00:36:28.579 --> 00:36:33.260
from Key West to Orlando, one circuit in the whole state.

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:36.420
Then we came to New York City, lived in the Bronx.

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:40.420
I had a circuit and we did district work in the Spanish field.

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:43.460
Then to Texas, to what they call the Valley of Texas,

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:46.860
the Rio Grande Valley for a couple of years on the circuit.

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:49.219
And then the district in Spanish

00:36:49.219 --> 00:36:52.380
from Houston, Texas to Ube City, California.

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:54.179
And we loved every minute of it.

00:36:54.179 --> 00:36:56.579
Well, that's definitely the traveling work.

00:36:56.579 --> 00:37:00.300
Then 1977 rolls around and you receive another invitation.

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:01.380
Yes, indeed.

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:04.659
We were doing pre-convention work in L.D.L.A.A.

00:37:04.659 --> 00:37:07.260
area at the Lermurt Assembly Hall.

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:11.219
And we received a letter inviting us to come to Bethel.

00:37:11.219 --> 00:37:14.780
And that was a very, very special privilege

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:16.380
to be invited to Bethel.

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:17.980
I went into the service department

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:19.460
because at that time, they invited

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:21.659
a number of traveling overseers to come in

00:37:21.659 --> 00:37:23.739
and work in the service department.

00:37:23.739 --> 00:37:25.820
And Sandra went into housekeeping

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:28.780
and we were both delighted to come to Bethel.

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:31.099
Well, sort of.

00:37:31.099 --> 00:37:34.260
I really, I really loved the ministry.

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:36.420
I loved the, especially there's a district

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:38.539
working with the circuit overseer and his wife

00:37:38.539 --> 00:37:41.340
every week and out service.

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:45.500
So I wasn't too anxious for this Bethel thing.

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:49.500
But you know, to hope again, those what you need.

00:37:49.539 --> 00:37:53.659
We came here and we started adjusting to Bethel life.

00:37:53.659 --> 00:37:56.780
And it really proved out to be a real blessing

00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:59.900
because we got the close association

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:03.260
with so many other loyal witnesses of Jehovah.

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:06.380
Well, I'm sure you have many more experiences

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:10.099
to let us know about, but we appreciate you sharing those.

00:38:10.099 --> 00:38:13.980
The governing body has made significant adjustments

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:17.860
in the work that is taking place at Bethel and the field.

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:21.099
And it has affected many long time faithful brothers,

00:38:21.099 --> 00:38:23.699
loyal brothers, and in the traveling work

00:38:23.699 --> 00:38:27.739
overseers in the congregation, overseers at Bethel.

00:38:27.739 --> 00:38:31.539
Bill, what do you think about some of these changes

00:38:31.539 --> 00:38:33.420
that the governing body has made recently?

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:35.739
I think they're very wise decisions.

00:38:35.739 --> 00:38:37.860
They know what is needed.

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:40.699
They appreciate the older men who have served for years.

00:38:40.699 --> 00:38:42.380
We know that the older brothers

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:45.900
been in circuit work, district work, wherever.

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:48.059
They're worthy of double honor because of the way

00:38:48.059 --> 00:38:50.619
they've given of themselves to the work.

00:38:50.619 --> 00:38:53.500
But we have to recognize to there comes a time

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:56.900
when we want the younger men to come along

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:58.699
to accept responsibility.

00:38:58.699 --> 00:39:01.059
And really, when we were young,

00:39:01.059 --> 00:39:05.059
we received responsibilities with very little background

00:39:05.059 --> 00:39:05.900
and training.

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:08.940
Now we've got all these schools for kingdom evangelizers,

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:11.940
the ministry's kingdom ministry school.

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:14.820
So many opportunities for younger ones to be trained.

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:17.940
And so I think it's a wonderful arrangement.

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:21.139
Many thousands of young men are doing so well

00:39:21.139 --> 00:39:23.019
ready to accept responsibility.

00:39:23.019 --> 00:39:25.739
It's a blessing for the entire organization.

00:39:25.739 --> 00:39:27.219
Well, thank you for sharing that.

00:39:27.219 --> 00:39:29.380
That will benefit many brothers.

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:31.739
So we look at this couple before us

00:39:31.739 --> 00:39:35.659
and we see someone who has made wise choices along the way.

00:39:35.659 --> 00:39:39.619
So we look back at over 60 years of faithful, loyal service.

00:39:39.619 --> 00:39:43.300
As you look back at decisions you were made in life,

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:44.380
any regrets?

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:46.940
Oh, absolutely none.

00:39:48.019 --> 00:39:52.739
We consider that whatever we have given up or done,

00:39:52.739 --> 00:39:55.139
it's been our gift to Jehovah.

00:39:55.139 --> 00:39:56.380
You know, when I was a little girl,

00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:58.219
I remember I used to go out on our farm

00:39:58.219 --> 00:40:01.300
and especially when there was a full moon.

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:03.619
And I used to pray to Jehovah and I'd say,

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:08.659
it just let me use up my life in your service.

00:40:08.659 --> 00:40:10.460
You know, he's answered that prayer

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:13.579
because my life is majority of it used up

00:40:13.579 --> 00:40:15.860
and he's let me do it in his service.

00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:16.699
Beautiful.

00:40:16.699 --> 00:40:18.340
And Bill, how do you view sacrifices

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:20.219
that you have made along the way?

00:40:20.219 --> 00:40:24.059
Well, as you know, a sacrifice can be something you give up

00:40:24.059 --> 00:40:25.980
to serve God perhaps,

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:29.179
or a sacrifice can be what you give to Jehovah.

00:40:29.179 --> 00:40:31.019
Like David said in Psalm 54,

00:40:31.019 --> 00:40:33.860
I will sacrifice to you willingly.

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:36.260
And that's how I view sacrifice.

00:40:37.219 --> 00:40:39.980
We're happy to give of ourselves to Jehovah God

00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:40.820
to serve Him.

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:44.619
And I want to add to Sandra has been a wonderful partner

00:40:44.619 --> 00:40:46.380
with me, willing to go anywhere,

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:49.780
put up with all kinds of circumstances and difficulty,

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:52.780
a scripture that I, there are a number of good scriptures,

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:54.139
obviously that we all love.

00:40:54.139 --> 00:40:56.940
But one in particular that stays in my mind

00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:00.619
is Romans chapter 14 verses seven and eight.

00:41:00.619 --> 00:41:03.820
We live, we live to Jehovah.

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:06.860
We die, we die to Jehovah.

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:09.059
So whether we live or we die,

00:41:09.059 --> 00:41:10.260
we belong to Jehovah.

00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:14.179
And we've made that decision, not just because he's the creator.

00:41:14.179 --> 00:41:18.420
We've made the decision to give ourselves to Jehovah God.

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:22.619
So absolutely, we've had the best life possible.

00:41:22.619 --> 00:41:26.659
We have no regrets at all about what we've done

00:41:26.659 --> 00:41:30.500
with our life giving Jehovah the first place.

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:32.460
Bill and Sandra, it's been a real privilege

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:33.739
to hear more about you.

00:41:33.739 --> 00:41:35.659
And I know there's more stories to tell.

00:41:35.659 --> 00:41:39.260
How can you boil down 60 plus years of loyal service

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:39.860
to Jehovah?

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:41.619
But you have given us great insights.

00:41:41.619 --> 00:41:44.420
Thank you for sharing those gems with us.

00:41:45.659 --> 00:41:48.019
Like the melanchons, many loyal witnesses

00:41:48.019 --> 00:41:50.099
were not taught the truths from the Bible,

00:41:50.099 --> 00:41:52.260
from birth to adulthood.

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:54.619
For some young ones, seeds of truths

00:41:54.619 --> 00:41:57.980
are planted along the way, but can lay dormant for years

00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:00.340
due to family circumstances.

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:04.019
Sister Corey Wells explains how her family special talent

00:42:04.019 --> 00:42:11.949
almost kept her from riding on the road to life.

00:42:11.949 --> 00:42:14.630
The first rodeo I performed in front of an audience

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:25.090
that was eight years old.

00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:29.849
We were considered one of the top two acts in rodeo,

00:42:29.849 --> 00:42:33.090
my strength lied in my fearlessness.

00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:43.269
Even though there was a certain amount of excitement,

00:42:43.269 --> 00:42:48.989
it was fun to travel, to be together as a family.

00:42:48.989 --> 00:42:55.250
It was empty.

00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:59.969
Trickriding is like gymnastics on the back of a running horse.

00:42:59.969 --> 00:43:02.050
We've had horses all of our life.

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:06.929
My father specialized in training courses.

00:43:06.929 --> 00:43:13.360
He used to send us to the mountains riding all day long,

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:15.039
and then we'd come home in the evening,

00:43:15.039 --> 00:43:17.880
and we would start trickriding.

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:20.599
The way we learned was by a book.

00:43:20.599 --> 00:43:24.320
We looked at stick pictures that showed how it should be done,

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:26.639
and so it was trial and error.

00:43:26.639 --> 00:43:30.679
At the same time that we were learning, our horses were learning.

00:43:30.679 --> 00:43:35.119
The horse that I rode just let me do anything.

00:43:35.119 --> 00:43:37.239
My horse's name was Sweetlips.

00:43:37.239 --> 00:43:41.400
I was eight when I got him, and I named him myself.

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:44.360
He was like my best friend.

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:48.440
My parents were very active in the rodeo as competitors.

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:49.800
My mom was bell racing.

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:53.360
My father was a saddle-brunk rider.

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:56.679
I grew up as one of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:43:56.679 --> 00:44:00.719
but when I was very young, maybe six or seven,

00:44:00.719 --> 00:44:03.719
my father stopped serving Jehovah.

00:44:03.719 --> 00:44:07.199
To be honest with you when they announced that at the Kingdom Hall,

00:44:07.199 --> 00:44:10.320
it really didn't have much meaning to me at the time.

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:13.199
I didn't know what it meant.

00:44:13.199 --> 00:44:16.199
And I could see people crying, and so I cried,

00:44:16.199 --> 00:44:18.719
but I didn't really understand it.

00:44:18.719 --> 00:44:21.760
Really from that point, our family was not active

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:24.599
as Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:44:24.599 --> 00:44:28.639
I grew up on the road traveling, rodeo to rodeo,

00:44:28.639 --> 00:44:33.039
from coast to coast, and from the south to the north,

00:44:33.039 --> 00:44:36.400
as far as the roads go.

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:39.800
The four of us rode initially, Connie Kelly, myself,

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:43.440
and my brother, Jim, our family traveled together.

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:46.559
That meant a lot to me.

00:44:46.559 --> 00:44:49.679
What separated us from the others at the time

00:44:49.679 --> 00:44:53.280
was the high speed that we did it at.

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:57.039
And also the difficulty with the tricks that we chose to do.

00:44:57.039 --> 00:44:58.639
People were very excited.

00:44:58.639 --> 00:45:03.599
They would hire us back at the same place year after year.

00:45:03.599 --> 00:45:08.639
Throughout all that time, we did not miss one memorial.

00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:09.719
We were always there.

00:45:09.719 --> 00:45:12.440
There was something in us.

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.280
We didn't know it when we were little,

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:19.519
but my parents had succeeded in planting the truth in our hearts.

00:45:19.519 --> 00:45:23.800
My link to the truth was my grandmother.

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:26.159
I can remember going to the ranch and visiting her.

00:45:26.159 --> 00:45:27.400
She was very busy.

00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:30.360
But one thing that really sticks in my mind

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:34.159
is she always studied every day.

00:45:34.159 --> 00:45:35.719
She read her Bible.

00:45:35.719 --> 00:45:38.000
Her magazines were studied.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.800
And I think it just put a seed in there

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:44.400
that later on started to grow.

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:48.039
I just felt like I needed direction.

00:45:48.039 --> 00:45:51.119
It's like a line was drawn in the sand.

00:45:51.119 --> 00:45:53.719
Take one path or the other.

00:45:53.719 --> 00:45:57.280
And so ironically, the first book that I picked up to read

00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:59.440
was the Bible.

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:02.559
One of the scriptures that probably meant the most to me

00:46:02.559 --> 00:46:06.239
was Proverbs 35 and 6.

00:46:06.239 --> 00:46:08.360
Trust in Jehovah with all your heart

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:11.119
and do not lean upon your own understanding.

00:46:11.119 --> 00:46:13.159
And all your ways, take notice of him.

00:46:13.159 --> 00:46:17.239
And he himself will make your path straight.

00:46:17.239 --> 00:46:19.440
I used to think about those words

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:23.280
and what I would have to do to live up to them.

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:26.239
Although we traveled with the rodeo about 10 months out

00:46:26.239 --> 00:46:29.400
of the year, we did go to the district convention

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:32.440
and the live forever book came out.

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:36.039
And there just came a time when I knew I

00:46:36.039 --> 00:46:38.440
needed to make changes.

00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:40.440
Sister started studying with me.

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:43.000
And as I started reading the Bible for myself

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.880
and studying, then Jehovah became real.

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:50.239
All it took was one or two people in the whole family

00:46:50.239 --> 00:46:55.760
followed my father to return to the truth.

00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:57.920
Trick writing was our family business.

00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:59.400
It was our livelihood.

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.719
But we had decided that we were done.

00:47:01.719 --> 00:47:03.559
We were going to stop.

00:47:03.559 --> 00:47:09.000
With that decision would come giving up everything we knew.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.079
I think the most difficult thing for me

00:47:12.079 --> 00:47:15.679
to do was to sell the horse.

00:47:15.679 --> 00:47:19.360
You just get such a close bond with them

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:24.039
when you're putting your life in their hands like that.

00:47:24.039 --> 00:47:26.280
But I was willing to do that.

00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:28.039
I knew what I wanted to do.

00:47:28.039 --> 00:47:31.659
I did it.

00:47:31.659 --> 00:47:36.099
I got baptized in October of 85.

00:47:36.099 --> 00:47:39.219
Our last performance was in February of 86.

00:47:39.219 --> 00:47:41.380
We just finished at our contracts.

00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:44.780
I started pioneering in September of 86.

00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:47.059
And I've never stopped.

00:47:47.059 --> 00:47:49.980
I also married a man who loves Jehovah.

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:52.139
We've had the privilege of working

00:47:52.139 --> 00:47:54.460
on international construction projects.

00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:56.059
We went to Mexico.

00:47:56.059 --> 00:47:58.059
We went to Venezuela.

00:47:58.059 --> 00:47:59.659
My father's an elder.

00:47:59.659 --> 00:48:02.300
My mom's pioneering.

00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:03.860
In fact, all of my siblings have

00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:07.980
been able to regular pioneer at some point in their lives.

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:10.900
We're presently in the circuit work.

00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:14.019
Serving Jehovah together is such a blessing.

00:48:14.019 --> 00:48:19.739
Everything that we do every day is for Jehovah.

00:48:19.739 --> 00:48:26.050
That's what I wanted to do when I made this decision.

00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:29.889
If I would have taken that other path when I was young,

00:48:29.889 --> 00:48:32.530
I may not be alive today.

00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:36.210
What I did was dangerous, even fame and fortune

00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:39.409
in the world, there's nothing there.

00:48:39.409 --> 00:48:40.329
I wanted the real life.

00:48:40.329 --> 00:48:44.900
I wanted to serve Jehovah.

00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:47.820
I have no regrets.

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:51.699
If I could change anything, when it comes to my service

00:48:51.699 --> 00:48:54.579
to Jehovah, I would change nothing.

00:48:54.579 --> 00:49:00.860
I would just do it better.

00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:02.940
It took courage for Corey and her family

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:07.460
to choose loyalty to Jehovah over an exciting rodeo career.

00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:09.420
Jehovah will always help us when we're

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:12.820
perfectly deciding how an activity or a career we love

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:15.260
affects our dedication to him.

00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:18.099
Can the time it demands, or even the danger involved,

00:49:18.099 --> 00:49:20.900
take us away from whole soul service?

00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:23.300
Our loyalty to Jehovah is expressed

00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:25.219
in how we follow Bible principles

00:49:25.219 --> 00:49:28.420
when making any important decision in life.

00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:31.260
We received a report from San Francisco, California,

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:34.059
in the United States, where publishers have been engaged

00:49:34.059 --> 00:49:38.500
in special metropolitan witnessing since 2013.

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:41.500
It's helping our brothers reach multiple language groups,

00:49:41.500 --> 00:50:00.389
start Bible studies, and make disciples.

00:50:00.389 --> 00:50:02.949
When I'm rolling the cards down to get ready for the work,

00:50:02.949 --> 00:50:05.309
I can feel people's eyes on me.

00:50:05.309 --> 00:50:07.590
And it makes me feel proud that I'm representing Jehovah,

00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:10.789
even before I get to the location.

00:50:10.789 --> 00:50:14.909
We have a chance to use our Bibles very regularly.

00:50:14.909 --> 00:50:17.030
We talk to honest-hearted people who are interested

00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:23.449
in really learning what the Bible teaches.

00:50:23.449 --> 00:50:26.730
Jehovah's reaching people in those far-to-reach areas

00:50:26.730 --> 00:50:29.929
where it could mean their life to even talk about things

00:50:29.929 --> 00:50:33.280
such as the Bible.

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.800
When you're part of the metropolitan work,

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:43.550
you get to welcome people being drawn by Jehovah.

00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:50.550
We see thousands of people every day who walk by our cards.

00:50:50.550 --> 00:50:53.909
While we're placing literature in up to 40 different languages

00:50:53.909 --> 00:50:56.150
each week, what's really exciting

00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:58.389
is to see how many conversations we're studying

00:50:58.389 --> 00:51:01.670
and how many Bible studies were an issue.

00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:04.630
We're visible to a lot of people in the community,

00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:07.309
especially those who were inactive

00:51:07.309 --> 00:51:12.230
or maybe were raised around the truth.

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:14.909
Jehovah's arranged to have his people put right

00:51:14.909 --> 00:51:16.590
in the center of everything.

00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:23.110
And we're able to meet people from all over the world.

00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:28.070
I've met people from Peru, South Africa, Japan, Germany,

00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:42.820
England, France, Italy, Cameroon, Congo, Boku.

00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:45.019
It's shown that greeting will be something like

00:51:45.019 --> 00:51:48.619
Makadi, Monon Zani, Chinese New Yorker,

00:51:48.619 --> 00:51:50.820
Kawanda, Zamanga, Farid Rao Kuveringapano,

00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:55.059
which is not a problem of a Bible.

00:51:55.059 --> 00:51:57.300
They show Maranning Bill in the Micah,

00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:06.739
which means, would you like to study the Bible?

00:52:06.739 --> 00:52:10.380
Which means, would you like to study the Bible in sign language?

00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:13.820
So when I asked her if she'd seen the sign language Bible,

00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:18.780
she shook her head no, and I showed her act 1727.

00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:20.619
And as soon as it was done, she started signing.

00:52:20.619 --> 00:52:21.659
I understood that.

00:52:21.659 --> 00:52:24.420
And then she said, didn't she say this was a free act?

00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:29.019
So right then, she started downloading it on her phone.

00:52:29.019 --> 00:52:31.739
We had a gentleman come up and wanted to first sit,

00:52:31.739 --> 00:52:34.380
he said debate, and then he said, just discuss.

00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:37.820
But as he's talking with us, he had to catch his train,

00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:40.019
but he missed three trains, because he

00:52:40.019 --> 00:52:42.380
wanted to continue the conversation and speak with us.

00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:44.019
It was a really good experience, because we just

00:52:44.019 --> 00:52:47.500
get to talk to people and let them see a different side of us.

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:51.300
It's not necessarily about whether we place a book with him or not.

00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:53.699
And in the end, he turned to my husband and I

00:52:53.699 --> 00:52:56.980
and said, you know, you're really good ambassadors.

00:52:56.980 --> 00:53:00.099
We start Bible studies here every day,

00:53:00.099 --> 00:53:02.420
and these studies are conducted globally.

00:53:04.659 --> 00:53:09.780
I met Alfredo in 2014, right before the memorial.

00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:10.980
He approached the cart.

00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:12.420
He had a rough life.

00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:14.619
He was doing a lot of bad things.

00:53:14.619 --> 00:53:17.900
And so he felt that he couldn't overcome them.

00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:20.940
So I told him that no matter how big his problems are,

00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:23.099
they're not too big for Jehovah.

00:53:23.099 --> 00:53:26.820
And so I encourage him to start studying the Bible again.

00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:33.860
Come now and let us sit matter straight between us.

00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:38.059
Since Jehovah, though your sins are like scarlet,

00:53:38.059 --> 00:53:43.059
they will be made as white as snow.

00:53:43.059 --> 00:53:47.820
When Jehovah forgives you, he forgives you completely.

00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:50.860
I got baptized, and in the same month,

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:54.860
I started auxiliary pioneering.

00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:58.179
It is such a privilege to be one of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:53:58.179 --> 00:54:04.730
with brothers all around the world.

00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:08.170
If anybody is hesitant to take part in a special metropolitan

00:54:08.170 --> 00:54:10.050
with the same work, maybe you're

00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:11.769
worried about finances.

00:54:11.769 --> 00:54:12.769
Time.

00:54:12.769 --> 00:54:14.969
Are you just afraid that it's something different?

00:54:14.969 --> 00:54:16.650
You won't know what to do.

00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:20.050
Please don't let any of those things stop you.

00:54:20.050 --> 00:54:21.530
It's from Jehovah.

00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:22.969
Grab, hold a bit.

00:54:22.969 --> 00:54:47.849
Tight, don't let go.

00:54:47.849 --> 00:54:50.489
Each month, the brothers and sisters in San Francisco's

00:54:50.489 --> 00:54:55.449
metropolitan witnessing distribute over 5,000 publications

00:54:55.449 --> 00:54:59.690
and start an average of 185 Bible studies.

00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:02.289
After some initial concern from local authorities

00:55:02.289 --> 00:55:05.369
over having literature cards at the Golden Gate Bridge,

00:55:05.369 --> 00:55:07.449
authorities have expressed appreciation

00:55:07.449 --> 00:55:11.969
for our brothers being there with a Bible's message of hope.

00:55:11.969 --> 00:55:14.730
It's been requested that we always have on hand

00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:18.449
the April 2014 awake with the cover title,

00:55:18.449 --> 00:55:19.969
Why Go On?

00:55:19.969 --> 00:55:22.730
Three reasons to keep living.

00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:25.769
One afternoon, an officer approached a card and said,

00:55:25.769 --> 00:55:28.130
well, your magazine worked.

00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:30.409
The police had just helped a young woman

00:55:30.409 --> 00:55:33.250
who was thinking of jumping from the bridge.

00:55:33.250 --> 00:55:37.369
When they reached her, she had the awake issue in her hand

00:55:37.369 --> 00:55:40.929
and had decided not to jump.

00:55:40.929 --> 00:55:44.889
Life in this system can be difficult for everyone,

00:55:44.889 --> 00:55:47.650
but our witnessing work comforts people

00:55:47.650 --> 00:55:52.250
and teaches them to know and think their creator for life.

00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:55.449
And the longer we know Jehovah as his witnesses,

00:55:55.449 --> 00:55:57.570
the more reasons we find to thank him

00:55:57.570 --> 00:56:00.050
for his acts of loyalty.

00:56:00.050 --> 00:56:03.610
We're even moved to sing our appreciation to Jehovah.

00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:05.769
Like in this music video entitled,

00:56:05.769 --> 00:56:07.929
our thanks go to you.

00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:48.630
We saw the family in our music video facing economic pressure

00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:50.030
and our dear older couple

00:58:50.030 --> 00:58:52.630
enduring the stress of failing health.

00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:55.230
But as Philippians for six encourages,

00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:58.510
they let their petitions be made known to God.

00:58:58.550 --> 00:59:00.670
You and I can do the same for any problem

00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:02.750
that causes us anxiety.

00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:04.550
We should not only supplicate Jehovah

00:59:04.550 --> 00:59:07.510
to give us his Holy Spirit so that we can endure,

00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:09.510
but also thank him,

00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:12.670
fully assured that he will not abandon his loyal ones.

00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:15.590
We'd again like to thank brother and sister,

00:59:15.590 --> 00:59:17.750
Malon Fond, for being here with us.

00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:20.750
With almost 60 years of full-time service,

00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:23.909
the Malon Fonds have so much they can share.

00:59:23.909 --> 00:59:25.670
So we're pleased to announce

00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:27.710
that an extended version of their interview

00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:30.949
will be released later this month on JW Broadcasting.

00:59:31.949 --> 00:59:33.349
Finally in our program,

00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:35.230
we have a special behind-the-scenes visit

00:59:35.230 --> 00:59:37.829
with the orchestra that records our beautiful

00:59:37.829 --> 00:59:39.789
Theocratic music.

00:59:39.789 --> 00:59:44.789
In December 2015, 75 musicians gather from 16 countries

00:59:45.590 --> 00:59:49.710
or a five-day section at our studio in Patterson, New York.

00:59:49.710 --> 00:59:54.150
A team of 15 technicians join them to record 22 pieces.

00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:56.630
Among several songs we sing at our meetings

00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:59.909
was the stirring arrangement of song 147,

00:59:59.909 --> 01:00:13.630
a special possession that we sang at this year's memorial.

01:00:13.630 --> 01:00:16.190
The orchestra took time from their busy session

01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:19.230
to send you their Christian love and greetings.

01:00:19.230 --> 01:00:21.710
And we thank them and the governing body

01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:25.230
for the music we have to joyfully praise our God, Jehovah.

01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:27.869
We're happy to have been together with you

01:00:27.869 --> 01:00:29.510
for this month's program.

01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:32.949
From Brooklyn, New York, this is JW Broadcasting.
