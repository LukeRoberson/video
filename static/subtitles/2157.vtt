00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:18.809
The first time I heard the word of truth

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:22.809
How about your home and a world that is new

00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:33.340
Love grew in my heart right up to this day

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.740
But I know this world wants to pull me up

00:00:36.740 --> 00:01:01.810
My blue side is runny strong

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:29.090
I will not ditch you

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.489
It's where we will stand

00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:36.530
Life builds on rock

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.930
And one builds on sand

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:51.090
This world around us wants us to believe

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.090
So they then be freed

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:31.439
Let's keep building
