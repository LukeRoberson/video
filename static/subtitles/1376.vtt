00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:09.839
The Assembly Hall is an educational center. This is a center of pure worship for all the

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:18.149
congregations that come. Taking care of Jehovah's House as part of sacred service, even going

00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:25.550
back to the temple, everyone had an assignment, they had someone to open the doors. So of course

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.670
they had somebody also maintaining things.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:37.310
As of December 2016, there's 773 Assembly Halls worldwide. There's so many details

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:43.270
on Assembly Hall, you can't do it all yourself to be overseer of Assembly Hall. We're excited

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:51.920
to do it, but it seemed real heavy at the time.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.520
It does take, in our particular case, a couple of hundreds, about 200 or so volunteers each

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:05.959
in every week that really are necessary to care for the Assembly Hall, the grounds, the

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:13.959
counting, the purchasing, the maintenance and the cleaning. Each and every one of these chairs,

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:21.719
the seating, all has moving parts, has to be maintained. And with 4,050 seats in here,

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:28.540
we can say that every single one of them has been maintained.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.620
John 217 says, the zeal for your house will consume me. And I think we have an opportunity

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:41.140
to show Jehovah that we have zeal, we have an eagerness, a fire for his house and caring

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.540
for it. So we appreciate all those that want to work at the Assembly Hall.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.819
So many of the dear friends, after they've just been in a whole day doing some terribly

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:57.599
dirty job, they thank you for the privilege. Well, that zeal for Jehovah's House. No

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:01.480
where else does that happen? And if you tried to do it yourself, if we hired somebody,

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.640
it wouldn't be as good as the work that the friends do when they come in.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.400
When the friends come on the weekend, this is an educational facility. So they come here

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:20.319
to be educated about Jehovah and new ones come and it needs to be dignified and reflect

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:26.599
Jehovah's qualities. So the cleaning that goes on, the maintenance that goes on, that's

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:35.469
what the purpose is. At lunchtime, we do a spiritual program. It could be a talk, could

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:42.870
be a discussion. And we really generally try to cover a topic that helps the volunteers

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.270
see the connection between their work at the Assembly Hall and kingdom preaching work.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:55.469
We are preachers. That's number one to spread the good news. And we see the results of

00:02:55.469 --> 00:03:11.759
that here. We're filling this place up. It's a real privilege. You learn so much from

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:17.719
the sacrifices that the friends make in order to serve Jehovah that it makes us feel

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:23.639
very small. And we realize what a blessing it is for us to be in that environment all

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:24.639
of the time.

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.879
The goal of any work in Jehovah's service is to help as many people as you can to come

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:34.360
to know him and to take care of his interests here on the earth. And we all have the same

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:41.789
goal, trying to please him and doing what we can.

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:51.069
Our goal, really, as Assembly Hall servants is to take care of the place in such a way,

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.590
take care of the Assembly Hall in such a way that not only saves and makes a wise use

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.750
of dedicated funds and resources, but also making things ready in such a way that on

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.150
Saturday morning, when the brothers and sisters walk in and the attendants and the sound

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.669
and the stage brothers are getting ready, all they really have to do is come on, flip the

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:17.149
switches, lights come on, air conditioning, heat, everything's functioning, where all

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:22.629
they have to do is just focus on the program and listen and take an instruction. That's

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:26.990
what we're asked to do. Listen and take an instruction. And we can do that when we're

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:33.589
not distracted by anything else. So if everything works well on an assembly day, we know we've

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:34.110
done our job.
