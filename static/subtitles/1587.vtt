00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:36.810
I've got some news.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.810
How do you feel about moving to the South Congregation?

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.810
Why the South Congregation?

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.810
We're not even in their territory.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:01:02.850
It's twice as far and feels like the wrong time with everything happening in the Congregation.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.849
But they need help.

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:07.849
So, brother Maseko asked.

00:01:07.849 --> 00:01:11.849
Just asked if we'd be willing.

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:20.920
I'm tired.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.920
We can talk about it tomorrow and you.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.920
No. I mean, I'm tired of everything.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.920
Starting over, making changes, this whole system.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.920
We've always been happy to do what Jehovah has asked.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.939
But I never thought this system would drag on for so long.

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.459
I don't think either of us.

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:51.459
Ever imagined would be where we are now.

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:54.459
I know we've made the right decisions.

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:59.180
But with our money so tight.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:07.459
And then, tonight, holding to Lani,

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:12.789
it's just strange to think that if...

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:17.199
if things had been different,

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:22.310
they'd probably have a family now.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.150
Tavo.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.150
James.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.150
What's the news, my friend?

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.150
You're getting an early start tonight?

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.150
Well, after this, I've got another job.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.150
Good thing I'm only 25.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.150
So, I hear you and Linda are moving to the South Congregation.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.150
We need you there.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.150
Yes, we're...

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.150
Well, we're talking about it.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.150
You and Linda are always eager to help.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.169
We try our best.

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:18.169
But this move...

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:20.169
I don't think we can do it.

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:21.169
Are you okay?

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:26.620
Maybe we're just running out of steam.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.800
Well, you both work very hard.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.800
So do you.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.800
What are you doing Saturday?

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.800
Could you come over for some dinner?

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.810
I understand.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.810
I never dream that I'll be this age in this system

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.810
and now look at these wrinkles.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.810
I don't see any wrinkles.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.810
You haven't slowed down a bit.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.810
I have my hard days.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.810
But I've learned a long time ago

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.810
that focusing on when the end will come,

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.810
it's just not good.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.810
That's what happened to Dorothy, you know?

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.810
We started pioneering right after we got married.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.810
We were excited.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.209
We thought that the end was really close.

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.899
But things just kept going.

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:27.899
Years went by.

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:31.339
And Dorothy changed.

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:36.339
She was angry that Armageddon hadn't come.

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:39.339
She started doubting it ever would.

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:47.089
In the end, she left Jehovah.

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:56.930
That had to be devastating.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.850
It was the hardest time of my life.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.850
And it's true that 2 Peter 3 verse 12

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.850
tells us to await and keep close in mind

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.850
the presence of the day of Jehovah.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.850
But we have to be careful not to wait in frustration.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.850
I remember how in Jesus' day,

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.850
many of his disciples stopped following him

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.850
because his words didn't meet their expectations.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.850
But what did Peter say?

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.850
Lord, who shall we go away to?

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.850
For you have sayings of everlasting life.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.850
The truth is the truth,

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:52.189
even if it doesn't unfold how or when you expect.

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:57.540
We have to be focused on giving our all today

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.540
and keeping ourselves in Jehovah's love.
