00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:23.199
At Deuteronomy 32-7, Moses urged the Israelites to pause and reflect on their spiritual heritage.

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:24.440
He said,

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.199
Remember the days of old.

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.440
Consider the years of past generations.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.240
Our museums at World Headquarters help us to do just that,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.280
to learn about our history,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.719
and consider how Jehovah has blessed and guided his people through these last days.

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:54.200
Of course, with the COVID-19 pandemic, visits to the museums had to be put on hold.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.719
But the work of the museum department has kept right on going.

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:06.299
In fact, the museum department has been busier than ever.

00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:13.579
In this report, we will provide an update on the work to create beautiful new museums

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:16.140
at dozens of branches.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.700
These museums will help our brothers and sisters world-wide

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.180
to explore the history of the Bible and our rich spiritual heritage.

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:36.180
Each museum project starts when a branch office writes the coordinators committee

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.500
to request approval to develop a new museum.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.620
Once approved, the coordinators committee provides direction about the type of museum to develop.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.859
The museum might present the history of the Bible in the languages of the branch territory,

00:01:53.859 --> 00:02:00.260
or a history museum showing how the work of Jehovah's Witnesses developed in the branch territory,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:06.739
or displays that give behind-the-scenes look at Bethel operations in the local branch.

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.500
The theme chosen for our museum was,

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.659
this is the heritage of Jehovah's servants.

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.139
We were helped to see the benefits of dividing the exhibition by time periods,

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:20.099
since it both aids in teaching and lends to the theme.

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.860
We're so grateful for the help we've received from the coordinators committee and the museum

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:31.539
department. An increased appreciation for everything that Jehovah has done for his people

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:33.620
can be seen in the eyes of the visitors.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.659
If all these projects coordinated through the museum department,

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.740
does that mean they'll all be the same?

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:44.620
The answer is most definitely no.

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:50.379
When developing exhibits, the museum department doesn't use a cookie cutter or one size of its

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:56.539
all approach. We want the visitors to the exhibit to experience the local history and culture of the

00:02:56.539 --> 00:03:01.500
branch territory and be encouraged by it. So even though we do have a set of standard exhibit

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.099
components we use, we work very closely with the local exhibit team to make sure that each exhibit

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:14.379
is unique and enjoyable. The Bible Museum that opened at the Argentina branch in 2019

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:21.500
is a good example of how museum content is tailored to the local branch territory.

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:27.819
From the mid-19th century to the beginning of the 20th century, Argentina received millions

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.620
of immigrants from all over Europe. And many of them brought with them their

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.300
Bibles and their native languages, the same Bibles with which some of them later learned the truth.

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:45.900
That is why it is so significant that our new Bible exhibition contains copies in Italian,

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:54.699
Armenian, and Hebrew among others. In Argentina there are also many people who speak different

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:59.659
indigenous languages. Therefore the history of the Bible in this country would not be complete.

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:04.699
If we did not include in our exhibition modern translations into these languages,

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:09.020
such as Wechi, Toba, Pilaga and Mokovia among others.

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:17.689
The museum department was also working on a new museum at the Scandinavia branch.

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:28.899
This was also a Bible Museum, but with a very unique story. In our exhibition on how the Bible

00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:36.980
and God's name have been preserved in Scandinavia, we show Bibles in all the Scandinavian languages

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:46.339
that use the name Jehovah. That is in Greenlandic, Icelandic, Fairways, Danish, Norwegian,

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:57.500
Swedish, yes, even in Samin. The two oldest complete Bibles we have are Gustav Vesas Bible

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:09.160
from 1541 and Christian III's Bible from 1550. Sadly, these Bibles do not contain Jehovah's

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:18.759
name. But interestingly, the 1550 Bible has a handwritten note which in Latin explains the

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:30.389
meaning of the name Jehovah. Our branch committee is so grateful to World Headquarters for the

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:38.230
direction given in 2019 while preparing the Bible exhibit at the France branch. The museum

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:44.949
department kindly offered to display an original copy of the 1535 French Olive Tom Bible.

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:57.339
This rare Bible is one of the most significant Bibles on display. Not only is it the first Bible

00:05:57.339 --> 00:06:05.660
to be translated from the original languages into French, but it also contains the divine name

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:14.860
Jehovah. As you can see, our museum's worldwide are providing faith strengthening divine education.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:22.379
It takes much work to do so. It's a real team effort. The coordinators committee provides

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:29.100
direction on the content while museum department personnel provide training and support for the

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:36.300
local branch exhibit teams. And once concepts are approved, the worldwide design construction

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:42.379
department and regional design construction department get involved in organizing the construction

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:51.370
work. The museum department helped us to select a suitable location that would meet the standards

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:57.129
of a real museum. The worldwide design and construction department reviewed the construction

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:04.089
process and budget. With their assistance, we built a museum that really is a powerful tool

00:07:04.089 --> 00:07:11.370
to instill love for Jehovah and his word. In the past, we have had various exhibits at the branch,

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.889
but this exhibit isn't like anything we have experienced.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:25.370
Our branch committee and the entire Bethel family were so impressed to see how Jehovah has made

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:34.329
this project possible. The story of our museums would not be complete without mentioning another

00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:42.009
important contributor. You, because many of the rare Bibles and historical items that are

00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:50.250
featured in our museums were donated by you, brothers and sisters. Thank you for your generosity.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:57.290
If you would like to share an item with us, please feel free to contact the museum department

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:04.410
at World Headquarters in Warwick. If possible, please include a photograph of your item.

00:08:04.889 --> 00:08:13.610
Jehovah is blessing the work being done to provide these inspiring museums to the worldwide

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:24.250
brotherhood. As of September 2021, 10 museums have already opened and we have more than 35 under

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:32.330
development or in the process of being built. Some of the next to open will be at the Belgium,

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:42.169
Britain, Central America, Czech Slowvak, Finland, Italy, Japan, and Nigeria branches.

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:50.409
These museums are powerful teaching tools that bring our history and the history of the

00:08:50.409 --> 00:09:00.169
Bible to life. So as soon as conditions allow it, please come and explore our museums for yourself.

00:09:00.889 --> 00:09:10.090
When you do, we feel confident you'll be moved to say as did the Psalmist at Psalm 77 11 to 13.

00:09:11.289 --> 00:09:18.730
I will remember the works of John. I will remember your marvelous deeds of long ago

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:27.529
and I will meditate on all your activity. What God is as great as you.
