00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:06.179
There are many exciting things happening in Jehovah's organization.

00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:12.539
On month after month, we read articles, watch videos, and hear personal experiences about

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.300
our brothers and sisters who are doing more for Jehovah.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.460
They are serving with a need is greater, or reaching out for the school for Kingdom of

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.260
Angelizers.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.519
They are working on construction, renovation, maintenance of Kingdom Halls, or other

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:29.660
Theocratic projects.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.399
No doubt many of you watching this program are excitedly looking forward to expanding

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.399
your ministry in one of these areas.

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.079
We encourage you to do so.

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:48.719
You can be assured that you will receive much fulfillment and many blessings from Jehovah.

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.280
On the other hand, there are others who are watching this program who may feel discouraged

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.640
because their circumstances may seem to limit their being involved as they would

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.159
like.

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:03.679
What are some of these circumstances?

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:11.280
These may include our age, our health, our economic situation, or physical limitations.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.719
For some of us, perhaps our upbringing, or past errors we have made in our life may cause

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:23.879
us to feel that we are limited as to what we can do for Jehovah.

00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:30.319
As we know well, focusing on our limitations can affect our joy, causing discouragement.

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:32.719
What can we do?

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:37.760
There are many examples in the scriptures of men and women who had circumstances beyond

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.560
their control that seemed to limit how much they could do for Jehovah.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.840
Others had to deal with the effects of their upbringing and family life, or with serious

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.560
errors they may.

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:57.159
Would they allow themselves to be limited by their circumstances or their past?

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.640
How did Jehovah feel about them?

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.079
How does Jehovah feel about us?

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:08.159
That is what we are going to discuss in this month's broadcast, which has the theme,

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:12.439
are you defined by your circumstances?

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:18.599
Let's start by looking at some who could have let their circumstances limit them.

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:22.759
Here's the first example of Joseph in the book of Genesis.

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:25.879
Now Joseph faced injustice at its worst.

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:30.800
His situation was especially hurtful since it was initially brought on by those who should

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.280
have been closest to him, his family.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.840
As a slave in Egypt and later as a prisoner, Joseph was indeed limited in what he could

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.639
do.

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.719
How might Joseph have reacted?

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:50.639
What Joseph could have become so preoccupied with what he could not do that he lost sight

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.319
of what he could do?

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.960
Did Joseph let his circumstances paralyze his life?

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.120
No.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.039
He chose to make the best of his situation.

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:07.400
In fact, note what Joseph did while serving as a slave in Potiphar's house, if we turn

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.680
together to Genesis chapter 39 and verse 4, Joseph kept finding favor in his eyes.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.960
And he became his personal attendant.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.919
So he appointed him over his house and he put him in charge of all that was his.

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:29.280
Joseph worked diligently within the limitations of his circumstances.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.919
He took a similar approach while in prison.

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:39.360
At Joseph focused on what he could do despite suffering the effects of injustice.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.360
As a second example, consider Hezekiah.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.879
Now Hezekiah is one who might easily have felt that he was defined by his upbringing.

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:55.080
Look at the terrible example that was set by his father, Ahaz, as recorded in 2 Kings

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.879
chapter 16.

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:04.680
2 Kings chapter 16 and notice what verse 3 says about Ahaz.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:11.199
Instead he walked in the way of the kings of Israel and he even made his own son pass

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:16.839
through the fire, following the detestable practices of the nations that Jehovah had

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:20.480
driven out from before the Israelites.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.399
Hezekiah's father did detestable things in opposition to Jehovah.

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:32.519
But Hezekiah showed that he was not the helpless victim of a poor parental example.

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:34.399
What did he do?

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:40.439
Well turn in your Bibles to 2 Kings chapter 18 and notice verse 3.

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:47.639
What it says about Hezekiah, he kept doing what was right in Jehovah's eyes, just as David

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.040
his forefather had done.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:57.079
Verse 5 says of Hezekiah, there was no one like him among all the kings of Judah.

00:04:57.079 --> 00:04:59.600
He became fully involved in true worship.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:06.519
Verses 6 and 7 says that Hezekiah held fast to Jehovah and Jehovah proved to be with

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:08.160
him.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.360
How encouraging.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.800
Hezekiah's example is for us.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.959
We can choose to be loyal to Jehovah and do much in our worship of Jehovah even if we

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:22.279
did not grow up in a family that served Jehovah fully.

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:26.639
We are not helpless victims of our environment.

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:34.240
Hezekiah's example reassures us that our past does not have to control our future.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.959
As a third example, consider the Apostle Paul.

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:44.279
He did not let his own past mistakes involving religious prejudice and violence stop him from

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:47.120
giving his all to Jehovah.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.319
How did Paul feel about his past?

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:56.360
Well let's read together in 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and verse 9.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:03.160
For I am the least of the Apostles and I am not worthy of being called an Apostle because

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.199
I persecuted the congregation of God.

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:10.240
I am the least of the Apostle.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.399
Later when writing to the Ephesians, as recorded Ephesians chapter 3 and verse 8, he calls

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:18.240
himself less than the least of all the holy ones.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:24.480
Finally, at 1 Timothy chapter 1 and verse 15, he now calls himself the foremost of all

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.480
sinners.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:32.160
Yes, Paul's prior treatment of the congregation weighed heavily upon him.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.680
But could Paul have reasoned that he was damaged?

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.839
Could he have reasoned that his past limited what he could do for Jehovah?

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:43.879
He could have, but Paul did not do that.

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:46.439
He poured himself out for the congregation.

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:50.759
Why Paul was privileged to write more books and letters in the Christian Greek scriptures

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:52.240
than anyone else?

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.439
He demonstrated an outstanding zeal for the ministry.

00:06:56.439 --> 00:07:02.120
Paul did not let his conduct in the past dictate what he could do for Jehovah.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.000
And there are many other examples as well.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.839
For example, are we in a difficult economic situation?

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:15.439
The account of 2 Corinthians chapter 8 tells us about the Macedonians.

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:21.319
Paul says that they were in deep poverty, yet they begged to have a financial share in

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:23.600
the relief work.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.759
Are we older in years?

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:27.519
We may think of Anna.

00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:34.680
The account in Luke chapter 2 verses 36 to 38 tells us as she was 84 years old, and

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.000
that her husband had died after just seven years of marriage.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Yes, she was never missing from the temple.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.600
She rendered sacred service day and night.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.759
What lessons do we learn from these accounts?

00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:53.920
Our dear brothers and sisters in Bible times were just like us.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:59.439
Many were in circumstances that they would not have chosen, yet they did not let their

00:07:59.439 --> 00:08:04.120
circumstances or their past to find them.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:09.959
They joyfully did what they could within the limits of their situation.

00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:11.759
And these are just a few examples.

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:14.160
There are many others in the Bible.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:20.720
Why not make it a personal study project to research faithful ones who are in circumstances

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.879
similar to yours?

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.480
How did they stay involved in Jehovah's work?

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:34.360
We are sure that you will be greatly encouraged.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:40.159
Now we've considered examples of those who did not let their circumstances hinder them

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:42.840
from giving their role to Jehovah.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:50.639
But another question is, how does Jehovah view his faithful servants despite their limitations?

00:08:50.639 --> 00:08:55.000
I've often thought about the example of John the baptizer.

00:08:55.039 --> 00:08:59.639
As we know, he was arrested shortly after Jesus started his ministry.

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:06.200
John could have felt that he was no longer of use to Jehovah or the work.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:14.120
Yet as recorded at Matthew 11 verse 11, Jesus said about John, among those born of women,

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:19.200
there has not been raised up anyone greater than John the Baptist.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:24.120
Jehovah's and Jesus' view of John was not based on the man's circumstances of being

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.879
in prison.

00:09:25.879 --> 00:09:31.159
Their view of John was based on who he was on the inside and on his relationship with

00:09:31.159 --> 00:09:33.159
Jehovah.

00:09:33.159 --> 00:09:36.120
Jehovah did not focus on the limitations.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.120
In Jehovah's eyes, John was great.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.279
He was still a faithful servant doing the best that he could.

00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:47.000
And that was all that really matter.

00:09:47.039 --> 00:09:50.879
Another example that may come to your mind is that of King David.

00:09:50.879 --> 00:09:55.600
As we know, King David committed serious sins.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.039
Yet David repented for his sins.

00:09:58.039 --> 00:10:02.080
And there is no record that he repeated them.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.879
How did Jehovah view him?

00:10:04.879 --> 00:10:12.559
Did Jehovah see David as damaged as a man who would always be limited in serving him?

00:10:12.559 --> 00:10:21.639
The hardest Jehovah's words directed to King Jeroboam at 1 Kings 14 and verse 8.

00:10:21.639 --> 00:10:27.360
But you have not become like my servant, David, who kept my commandments and who walked

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:33.320
after me with all his heart, doing only what was right in my eyes.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.879
Jehovah viewed David as a special servant.

00:10:35.879 --> 00:10:38.440
He says he kept my commandments.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.799
He did what was right in my eyes.

00:10:41.799 --> 00:10:44.720
That's what Jehovah remembered.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.440
How encouraging that is for us.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:53.679
If we have repented of our past mistakes and set matters straight to the best of our circumstances,

00:10:53.679 --> 00:10:58.879
we too can be assured that Jehovah loves us dearly.

00:10:58.879 --> 00:11:04.399
He appreciates whatever we can do in our worship of him.

00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:06.399
So what's the point?

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:14.519
All our past or our present circumstances do not define our value before Jehovah.

00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:20.519
Our father loves us for who we are and he values our efforts as we do the best that

00:11:20.519 --> 00:11:23.759
we can to serve him.

00:11:23.759 --> 00:11:30.399
Why do you think it is important that we strive to see ourselves as Jehovah does?

00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:36.720
Because we can weaken, discourage or limit ourselves if we see ourselves only in the

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:40.320
framework of our circumstances.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:44.200
May we work hard not to do that.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:48.720
What does Jehovah see when he looks at his faithful servants today?

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:55.039
Well, turn please to 1 Samuel, chapter 16 and verse 7.

00:11:55.039 --> 00:11:59.799
And the setting is Samuel was about to go to anoint the next king of Israel and he goes

00:11:59.879 --> 00:12:04.240
to the house of Jesse and Jesse lines up all of his sons except David who is still out

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:09.399
in the field and Samuel walks in and he sees a lie out.

00:12:09.399 --> 00:12:14.919
And based on what he sees, Samuel concludes that this surely must be the next king of

00:12:14.919 --> 00:12:16.840
Israel.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.399
Yet note what Jehovah saw.

00:12:19.399 --> 00:12:24.919
Please read with me, 1 Samuel, chapter 16 and verse 7.

00:12:24.919 --> 00:12:31.919
But Jehovah said to Samuel, do not pay attention to his appearance and how tall he is where

00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:34.200
I have rejected him.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:39.279
For the way man sees is not the way God sees.

00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:46.320
Because mere man sees what appears to the eyes, but Jehovah sees into the heart.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.720
That's the way Jehovah sees.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.840
He does not look at our outward appearance and our abilities.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.399
He sees into our heart.

00:12:53.399 --> 00:12:57.799
He sees what we would be doing if all the limitations were lifted off of us.

00:12:57.799 --> 00:13:03.639
Why just the fact that we keep going, that we keep putting one foot in front of another

00:13:03.639 --> 00:13:07.320
endeers us to Jehovah?

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:12.720
We understand the truth of that statement and we all may agree that this is how Jehovah

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.399
views his people.

00:13:14.399 --> 00:13:22.919
However, we may have a hard time convincing ourselves if this really applies to me.

00:13:22.919 --> 00:13:27.080
Have you ever wondered does Jehovah really see me?

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:32.720
Does he see what's in my heart and value my desire to do more for him?

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.519
The answer is yes.

00:13:34.519 --> 00:13:40.120
In fact, Jehovah has already seen what is in your heart.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.919
Think about this.

00:13:41.919 --> 00:13:44.320
Why are you watching this program?

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:48.000
But why do you care about spiritual things?

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.720
Why are you perhaps the only one in your family who is a dedicated baptized servant of Jehovah?

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:58.000
Or why are you perhaps the only one in your place of employment, or the only one near

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.519
where you live who's serving Jehovah?

00:14:01.519 --> 00:14:06.159
Is it because you're so much more studious or smarter than everyone else?

00:14:06.159 --> 00:14:08.159
No.

00:14:08.159 --> 00:14:15.200
Agai chapter 2 and verse 7 tells us that Jehovah will shake all the nations and the precious

00:14:15.279 --> 00:14:18.480
things of the nations will come in.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:29.039
John chapter 6 verse 44 says that no man can come to Jesus unless the Father draws him.

00:14:29.039 --> 00:14:37.039
Jeremiah chapter 31 verse 3, Jehovah says, I have loved you with an everlasting love.

00:14:37.039 --> 00:14:40.559
That is why I have drawn you.

00:14:40.559 --> 00:14:44.480
So again, why are you serving Jehovah?

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.240
Because Jehovah loves you.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.519
Jehovah drew you as he was shaking the nations.

00:14:49.519 --> 00:14:55.480
He looked down into your heart and he saw something very precious and he drew you to him.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.799
He says, I want to draw this person to my son.

00:14:57.799 --> 00:15:00.200
I want to draw this person to me.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:04.340
I love this person.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:10.500
Jehovah drew you, not because you had perfect circumstances, but because of your heart

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:12.539
and because he loves you.

00:15:12.539 --> 00:15:21.070
He greatly appreciates that his servants give their best to him.

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:25.710
Remember not the way man sees is the way God sees.

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:28.350
Jehovah sees what the heart is.

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:36.190
May we work hard to see ourselves as Jehovah does and be determined to never give up.

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:40.429
May we never forget that it is the privilege of bearing Jehovah's name,

00:15:40.509 --> 00:15:45.789
having a relationship with him and our love for Jehovah that defines us.

00:15:45.789 --> 00:15:50.350
Jehovah is happy if we give the best that we can.

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:55.789
So may we do our part by not limiting ourselves due to our circumstances,

00:15:55.789 --> 00:16:00.350
but always look for ways to give our best to Jehovah.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:04.350
You beautiful older ones, even those with severe health problems,

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:07.629
can do much to help in the great work that's taking place today.

00:16:07.629 --> 00:16:10.269
Now you may wonder, what can you do?

00:16:10.269 --> 00:16:12.110
You can pray for your brothers and sisters.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:13.470
We need your prayers.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:15.070
Pray for the governing body.

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:17.070
Pray for those who are taking the lead.

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:19.710
Pray for the elders in your congregations.

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:23.470
Pray for those who are going through difficult times.

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:27.070
Do such prayers help the work of the organization?

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:28.669
Absolutely.

00:16:28.669 --> 00:16:31.629
James chapter five in verse 16 tells us

00:16:31.629 --> 00:16:37.549
that a righteous person's supplication has a powerful effect.

00:16:37.549 --> 00:16:41.549
No matter who we are and whatever our situation in life,

00:16:41.549 --> 00:16:46.669
may we find joy in giving what we can or Jehovah.

00:16:46.669 --> 00:16:50.509
And may each one of us rejoice at the privilege we have

00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:55.950
of being part of what Jehovah is accomplishing in these last days.
