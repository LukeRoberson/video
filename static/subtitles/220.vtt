00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.009
Have you ever considered who is the greatest example of humility?

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:11.009
If your answer is Jehovah, you're correct. Why?

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:16.010
Because every living intelligent creation is inferior to him,

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:22.010
yet he chose to and continues to include others in his activities.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:32.009
Humility can be described as loatheness of mind and being free from pride and arrogance.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:39.009
A humble person finds happiness in including others in his life and endeavors.

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:46.009
Because of its many benefits, our theme for discussion this month is humility,

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:51.009
a quality that will enrich our life eternally.

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:59.009
Jehovah's great measure of humility became apparent when he collaborated with his only begotten son

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:04.010
and included him as his master worker in creation.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:14.010
Later, as angels were created, these mighty spirit creatures imitated the humility already being shown by Jehovah.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.010
These faithful angels were free from pride and arrogance.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:26.010
This resulted in everyone in heaven enjoying peace for eons of time.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:34.010
Humility in heaven was like oil to an engine. It keeps things running smoothly.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:40.010
Satan was the first one to succumb to the temptation of pride and arrogance,

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.010
rejecting the godlike quality of humility.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.010
When he did so, rebellion and turmoil soon followed.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:02:00.010
But it's important for us to note that the need for humility didn't arise because of sin, rebellion and imperfection.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.010
Humility existed before these ugly traits.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:15.009
It's also vital for us to understand that while Jehovah is inferior to no one, that's not the case with us.

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:21.009
Jehovah knows that the quality of humility will help us in our imperfect condition.

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:30.009
For example, it will help us to imitate him, to faithfully serve him, and to survive the end of the system of things.

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:38.009
Yes, Jehovah knows that humility will enrich our lives today and eternally.

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:47.009
We can see how important this endearing quality is to Jehovah when we read Psalm 45 verses 3 and 4.

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:55.009
Jehovah gave these prophetic instructions to his kingly son before the great battle in heaven.

00:02:55.009 --> 00:03:02.009
Strap your sword on your side, O mighty one, in your dignity and your splendor.

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:10.009
And in your splendor, go on to victory, ride in the cause of truth and humility and righteousness.

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:21.009
These verses describe Jesus Christ as a king, riding in battle to defend truth, humility and righteousness.

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:28.009
The greatest truth, he defends, is the sanctification of Jehovah's great name.

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:34.009
In connection with righteousness, he supports Jehovah's standards of right and wrong.

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:43.379
And in the case of humility, he restores it to its rightful place among all intelligent creation.

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.379
Jesus has already reaffirmed these timeless standards in heaven.

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:56.379
Soon, he'll do the same for the earth, with the commission to save only those who are humble and obedient.

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:03.379
Our developing and displaying humility then, is essential to our survival.

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:10.379
If you want to know if you're truly humble at heart, ask yourself, how do others view me?

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:19.379
If you serve as a congregation elder, do your fellow elders feel comfortable giving you counsel?

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:24.379
When was the last time they did so? How did you react?

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:31.379
If you're serving as a pioneer, do you endeavor to learn from those with less experience?

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:40.379
Do our loved ones and our family feel that we really consider their opinion on matters?

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:43.379
Why are questions like these important?

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:51.379
Because a truly humble person will make a realistic assessment of himself with such questions.

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:57.379
Why is that? Because humility is directly related to honesty.

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:09.379
True humility enables us to see ourselves as we really are, and to honestly admit all of our weaknesses and failures.

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:20.379
In contrast, pride and arrogance are directly related to deception, and arrogant person covers up his weaknesses and failures.

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:30.379
And that can only last so long because, eventually, pride leads to a crash as Proverbs 16 verse 18 warns us.

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:36.699
Let's consider five ways that humility enriches our life.

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:44.259
First, the Bible clearly teaches that humble people receive God's help.

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:47.259
One example is David.

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:57.259
He became a powerful king in Israel, yet notice who he attributed his greatness to at Psalm 18 verse 35.

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:06.259
You give me your shield of salvation, your right hand supports me, and your humility makes me great.

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:16.259
Because Jehovah is humble, he lured himself to assist David, enabling this humble man to become a mighty king.

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:22.259
Down to our day, Jehovah delights to come to the aid of his humble servants.

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:27.259
Have you not felt him stoop down as it were to help you?

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:38.509
A second benefit is that having a humble disposition will protect us, just as a heavy coat can protect us from harsh elements.

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:45.509
It also makes our personality more attractive to Jehovah and to others.

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:52.509
Notice the word picture Peter used at first Peter 5 verse 5b.

00:06:52.509 --> 00:07:05.509
But all of you clothe yourselves with humility toward one another because God opposes the haughty ones, but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones.

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:09.509
Clothing both protects and dignifies.

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:16.509
If we're missing an item of clothing or our clothing is frayed, others can surely see it.

00:07:16.509 --> 00:07:24.509
Likewise, others can usually see if we're not fully clothed with humility.

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:32.509
In contrast, the more humility we display, the more attractive we are to Jehovah and to others.

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:42.509
Like a favorite garment, humility should be our go-to quality that's perfect for any occasion.

00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:48.509
A third benefit of humility is that it fosters teamwork.

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:57.509
When co-workers apply Philippians chapter 2 verse 3, they're able to enjoy productive collaboration.

00:07:57.509 --> 00:08:09.509
The verse says, do nothing out of contentiousness or out of ecotism, but with humility consider others superior to you.

00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:18.509
When we appreciate that everyone is superior to us in some way, we'll be more inclined to listen to their suggestions.

00:08:18.509 --> 00:08:23.509
Humility promotes cooperation, not competition.

00:08:23.509 --> 00:08:29.509
Humble people see others as resources and contributors, not rivals.

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:32.509
Consider a single musician.

00:08:32.509 --> 00:08:37.509
By himself he can generally only produce the sound from one instrument.

00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:45.509
However, as a member of an orchestra, the entire music performance is enriched.

00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:53.509
A humble musician finds contentment in collaboration, even if that places him in the background.

00:08:53.509 --> 00:09:04.509
He doesn't aspire to receive all the attention of a solo performance or to place all out, he drowns out his fellow performers.

00:09:04.509 --> 00:09:12.509
One translation renders humility at Philippians 2 verse 3 to be self-effacing.

00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:21.509
This means to make ourselves inconspicuous, working in the background and avoiding the limelight.

00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:27.509
That's like a photographer who takes portraits of others instead of himself.

00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:38.509
And as he focuses on others, the photographer endeavors to capture their features in the best light so that they look their best.

00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:41.509
The same principle applies to our sacred service.

00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:48.509
In all aspects of our worship, let's remember that we're part of Jehovah's team.

00:09:48.509 --> 00:09:56.509
By all of us humbly cooperating together, we'll be useful to Jehovah in accomplishing his will.

00:09:56.509 --> 00:10:04.509
Our humility will put others in a favorable light with God and with others.

00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:15.509
A fourth benefit of humility is that a humble person genuinely enjoys seeing others make advancement or receive privileges.

00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:19.509
John the Baptist is a good example in this regard.

00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:29.509
He humbly acknowledged that Jesus' ministry would keep on increasing as his own work would keep on decreasing.

00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:32.509
How did John feel about that?

00:10:32.509 --> 00:10:38.509
Seeing the advancement of Jesus moved John to say at John 3 verse 29,

00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:43.509
my joy has been made complete.

00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:53.509
Like John, humility allows a brother to be an overseer at one time and one being overseen at another time.

00:10:53.509 --> 00:11:01.509
If you have the privilege to serve as a congregation elder, can you see how this spirit would benefit your entire elder body?

00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:07.509
A fifth benefit is that humility helps us to endure opposition.

00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:11.509
A humble person doesn't feel he's above being reproached.

00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:20.509
He's able to endure unpleasant situations and not retaliate if Jehovah permits him to suffer adversity.

00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:26.509
We have the example of Jesus as highlighted at 1 Peter 2 verse 23.

00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:33.509
There it says, when he was being insulted, he did not insult in return.

00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:43.509
When he was suffering, he did not threaten, but he entrusted himself to the one who judges righteously.

00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:55.509
What helped Jesus to endure? Humility. He didn't think, do you know who I am? I shouldn't have to suffer like this.

00:11:55.509 --> 00:12:02.509
Likewise, our maintaining a humble demeanor may well serve as a protection for us.

00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:08.509
Perhaps even moving observers to come to our aid when others oppose us.

00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:15.509
We've just talked about five benefits of humility and there are many others.

00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:24.509
But what if we find that our background or our culture makes cultivating humility especially challenging for us?

00:12:24.509 --> 00:12:34.509
This is how you feel. You may be encouraged by the example of a Roman army officer introduced to us in Matthew 8.

00:12:34.509 --> 00:12:40.509
A Roman centurion had direct command of about 100 soldiers.

00:12:40.509 --> 00:12:46.509
He likely had a past littered with many acts of violence and bloodshed.

00:12:46.509 --> 00:12:52.509
Humility was likely not a quality associated with many officers of this rank.

00:12:52.509 --> 00:12:56.509
Let's read the account in Matthew 8.5 through 8.

00:12:56.509 --> 00:13:05.269
When he Jesus entered Capernaum, an army officer came to him pleading with him and saying,

00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:12.269
Sir, my servant is laid up in the house with paralysis and he's suffering terribly.

00:13:12.269 --> 00:13:17.269
He said to him, when I get there, I will cure him.

00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:28.269
The army officer replied, Sir, I'm not worthy to have you come under my roof but just say the word and my servant will be healed.

00:13:28.269 --> 00:13:37.269
The officers addressing Jesus twice as Sir was significant since Romans generally despised Jews.

00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:48.269
This army officer also said in verse 8, I am not worthy. In other words, I'm not important enough for you to come under my roof.

00:13:48.269 --> 00:13:56.269
Though I named in the scriptures, he proved himself to be an outstanding example of humility.

00:13:56.269 --> 00:14:02.269
Note what Jesus said about this officer at Matthew 8 verse 10.

00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:14.269
When Jesus heard that, he was amazed and said to those following him, I tell you the truth, with no one in Israel have I found so great a faith.

00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:24.269
How does this account encourage us? Despite our past, like the army officer, all of us can develop humility.

00:14:24.269 --> 00:14:31.269
How can we do so? Cultivated desire to be humbled to your very core.

00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:38.269
Frequently remind yourself that to please God, you must be humble.

00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:44.269
Also remember that pride and arrogance are traits of Satan.

00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:52.269
Keep the correct perspective by meditating on your insignificance compared to Jehovah.

00:14:52.269 --> 00:14:57.269
And pray to Jehovah for help to display humility as he does.
