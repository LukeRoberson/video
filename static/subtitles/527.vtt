00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:08.550
Today's printed comments consider how Satan has blurred people's view of Jehovah.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.550
Satan has blurred their view or blinded people by means of apostate teachings.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.550
And by seeing to it that God's name has been removed from many copies of the Bible.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.550
For this morning's discussion, we want to consider a related concern.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.550
And that is, what current and future events in Satan's world could blur our view of God's kingdom

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.549
if we're not careful.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:41.549
With each point, we'll tie in the principle found in these words in Jeremiah chapter 10 and verse 23 where it says,

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:47.549
I well know, O Jehovah, that man's way does not belong to him.

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:52.549
It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step.

00:00:52.549 --> 00:01:04.549
With this in mind, we're going to look at how widespread protests, political promises, and claims of peace and security could distort our view of God's kingdom if we're not careful.

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.549
First, widespread protests.

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:16.549
When protests sweep through any country, there's often someone leading the way with a very loud or persuasive voice, true?

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:22.549
And their message usually touches on something that many see as an injustice.

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:32.549
Whether the protest involves dozens, hundreds or thousands of people, most of the protesters are followers, and they repeat a message or slogan.

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.549
The problem is that the solutions they seek are human solutions.

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:45.549
Recall Jeremiah's words, it does not belong to man, even to direct his step.

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.549
What danger do such protests pose for true Christians?

00:01:49.549 --> 00:02:00.549
The danger is this, if we get caught up in the spirit of popular protests, even slightly supporting a cause, even silently within our heart,

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:06.549
we could find our view of God's kingdom growing dim, what in turn could that lead to?

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:14.550
Well, when people in the world lack clear direction or hope, their hearts often start to be filled with anger and rage.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:21.550
A servant of God can feel such things, too, if he or she loses sight of the kingdom.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:28.550
Consider for a moment what happened to those who followed after King David's son, Absalom.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.550
The Bible explains that Absalom objected to his father's rulership, but he did more than that.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.550
Through cunning words and actions, he gathered a following.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.550
You can read about what he did at 2 Samuel chapter 15 and verses 2 through 6.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:54.550
He promised the people justice, and verse 6 says that Absalom kept stealing the hearts of the men of Israel.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.550
In other words, the people got caught up in his message.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.550
Eventually, those who joined him turned violent, and the outcome was disastrous.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:17.550
Yes, even the hearts of those who worship Jehovah can be stolen or captured, or as today's text says, let us stray, for a misguided or bad purpose.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.550
So that is the danger, and we can be certain that Satan knows it.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:32.550
There's no question that Satan is right now using various messages of protest to direct people away from the real solution, God's kingdom.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.550
And Satan will cast his net wide to try to capture some of Jehovah's people if possible.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:48.550
To avoid that and remain focused on the kingdom, we must not forget what Isaiah 42 and verse 1 promises about Jesus.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:55.550
There it foretells that he will bring justice to the nations. He will, not humans.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:05.550
As King of God's kingdom, Jesus is the one who will bring what sinful humans can never bring real justice for people.

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.550
A second thing that can blur our view of the kingdom if we're not careful is political promises.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.550
Is there no end to the false promises that people will make when they want power?

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:26.550
And even when politicians try to fulfill some of their promises, they often fall short on the wisdom and the resources to do it effectively.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:33.550
Political powers can only provide short-term human solutions at best.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.550
They often cave in to popular and immoral thinking.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:43.550
Their thoughts are so distorted that they have difficulty seeing right from wrong.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:53.550
They face long-term problems, including social unrest, that they cannot permanently solve and no amount of money can fix it for them.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.550
Again, we recall Jeremiah's words, it does not belong to man, even to direct his step.

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:07.550
When the rulers of ancient Rome tried to put down social unrest, they gave many things to the people for free.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:13.550
Food, entertainment, and many services were free or very cheap.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.550
They called it bread and circuses.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.550
See, that was their formula to appease the people and gain their allegiance.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:27.550
But like the governments of today, that man-made empire was in gradual decline.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:34.550
And the humans in charge had no long-term answers, only short-term offerings.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:41.550
Now, it's likely that the early Christians in Rome and elsewhere benefited from some of the things that the empire provided.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.550
Food, water, good roads, and so forth.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:53.550
Still, those early Christians needed to remain focused on the Lord and on his promised kingdom.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.550
Otherwise, their view of things could have become distorted.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:03.550
And they might have been pulled into compromising their faith by giving undue glory to the empire.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.550
How short-sighted that would have been.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:12.550
That empire in Rome would have eventually turned against those Christians.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.550
Today, we too may benefit from some of the things that the nations are doing.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:25.550
But like the early Christians, we must never allow the kingdom to become out of focus in our minds and hearts.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.550
What will help us to do this?

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:34.550
We're helped when we remember that Jehovah and his son are in charge of man's future.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.550
The solutions they offer are permanent.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.550
The promises they have made will be fulfilled.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:50.550
If we keep that focus, then when this man-made system turns against God's people, it will have no hold on us.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:56.550
As God's Word directs, we submit to man's rulership where it does not conflict with God's rule.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:02.550
But in following that direction, we're not entrusting our future to political promises and favors.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:07.550
We entrust our future to God's kingdom alone.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:19.550
The more that the nations try to appease the people through political promises, the more determined we must be to keep the kingdom in focus, the real solution.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:29.550
That leads us to the third thing that could blur or distort our view of God's kingdom, namely when the nations are saying peace and security.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:42.550
At first Thessalonians 5-3, God's Word foretells that whenever it is that they, the political powers, are saying peace and security, then sudden destruction is to be instantly on them.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.550
Why will sudden destruction come?

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:49.550
Because human governments are not the solution.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:56.550
Despite having heard the kingdom message, the nations will not stop trusting in themselves to solve their problems.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:11.550
At some point, the political powers will arrogantly be saying peace and security in a way that fulfills first Thessalonians 5-3, Jehovah knows how and when that will prove to be.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:19.550
Yet no matter how much or how loudly the nations will be saying it, they cannot change this fact.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:24.550
It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step.

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:32.549
Just as humans cannot simply flap their arms and fly, so too humans cannot rule themselves successfully.

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:44.549
So as things move ahead toward the great tribulation, we must not allow ourselves to be fooled no matter how convincing the speeches and boasts from the nations may sound.

00:08:44.549 --> 00:08:58.549
And we will not be fooled if we refuse to get caught up in popular protests that seek human solutions to the world's problems, if we refuse to place our trust in political promises.

00:08:58.549 --> 00:09:05.549
And if we refuse to be fooled by the nations saying peace and security.

00:09:05.549 --> 00:09:15.549
So no matter what Satan's world promotes in the news on social media or elsewhere, we're convinced that God's kingdom alone is the solution.

00:09:15.549 --> 00:09:18.549
What can we do to keep that focus?

00:09:18.549 --> 00:09:24.549
Keep preaching the good news of the kingdom to people, including the warning about what is coming.

00:09:25.549 --> 00:09:37.549
Remember that Jehovah and his son are the ones who are in charge of man's future and never allow Satan and his world to weaken your faith and blur your view of God's kingdom.

00:09:37.549 --> 00:09:39.549
And always have this in mind.

00:09:39.549 --> 00:09:44.549
It stated in Isaiah chapter 26 and verses 3 and 4,

00:09:45.549 --> 00:09:47.549
Where it says of Jehovah,

00:09:47.549 --> 00:09:51.549
You will safeguard those who fully lean on you.

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:56.549
You will give them continuous peace because it is in you that they trust.

00:09:56.549 --> 00:10:02.549
Trust in Jehovah forever for John Jehovah is the eternal rock.
