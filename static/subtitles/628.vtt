00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.189
I don't know what to do.

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:05.710
I don't know what decision to make.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.669
Have you ever said that?

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:09.949
You may be in that situation right now,

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:11.990
perhaps the decision you're facing

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.349
is dealing with a family issue,

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.070
or perhaps trying to choose a medical path

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.309
for a serious health problem,

00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:22.910
or maybe it has something to do with your work assignment.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.750
Then to further complicate matters,

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.269
it may be that there's no right or wrong answer,

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:30.070
but rather a number of options,

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.710
each with their own advantages or disadvantages.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.789
And then we add the uncertainty of our times,

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:41.030
and we may be frozen and just cannot make a decision.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.630
Well, we've all been in that situation.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.149
Well, our text for today and some surrounding verses,

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.070
give us some points that can help us.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.789
Let's look at our scripture text again

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:54.490
in Hebrews chapter six and verse one.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:55.890
Hebrews six and verse one,

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.490
this is therefore now that we have moved

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.250
beyond the primary doctrine about the Christ,

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.209
let us press on to maturity.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:07.769
Yes, we're to press on to maturity.

00:01:07.769 --> 00:01:10.969
Now, you notice this first starts off with therefore.

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:14.489
That means it links back to what Paul was talking about previously.

00:01:14.489 --> 00:01:17.250
And you go back to chapter five and verse 11,

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.849
he's talking about those who were not mature.

00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:21.450
They should have been, but they weren't,

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.810
and they needed solid food.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:24.969
Why?

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:26.489
Let's look at verse 14.

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:29.569
Hebrews chapter five, verse 14,

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:32.810
but solid food belongs to mature people.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.569
To those who through use have their powers of discernment

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:40.450
trained to distinguish both right and wrong.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.489
See, spiritual maturity gives us power.

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:45.129
Gives us powers of discernment

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:49.010
and those powers of discernment allow us to make decisions,

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.090
to be able to use principles to see how to make decisions

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.569
when things are unclear or there's no rule to guide us.

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:00.489
So with that in mind, we're going to consider three points.

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:04.409
Number one, why is spiritual maturity needed

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.769
to make decisions based on principles?

00:02:06.769 --> 00:02:09.210
At number two, how do we use principles

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.370
to help us make decisions?

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.449
And number three, what Bible examples or example

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:18.810
gives us confidence that we can successfully face

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.930
naughty and complicated decisions

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.050
even if we're on our own.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.770
So let's start with our first point.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.409
Why is spiritual maturity needed

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.729
to make decisions based on principles?

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:33.969
Well, picture, if you will, that you walk up to a door

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:37.930
and the sign on that door says, do not enter.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.770
At verses you walk up to another door

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.849
and the sign on that door says, proceed with caution.

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:45.449
Now, the first is very clear.

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:46.330
You don't go in.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.409
It's a rule.

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:49.169
But the other one, we have a decision

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:50.409
to make, should I go in?

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:52.330
Why do I have caution?

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.250
Do I need a hard hat?

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.289
What's on the other side of that door?

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:57.849
Or let's say you drive onto a road

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.729
and there's a sign that says, speed limit 65.

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:06.090
Versus driving onto a road and the sign says, drive safely.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.210
Again, the first one, we know exactly what to do.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.090
I can go right to 65 and keep it there.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.409
On the other one, I have a decision to make.

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:14.889
How fast should I drive?

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:18.449
What is safe driving on this road?

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:21.090
Or to complicate matters further,

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.610
let's say the sign on that door just says caution

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.409
and the road sign just says, travel at your own risk.

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:30.250
Now, what do I do?

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.569
Do I even go near the door?

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.289
Do I even drive onto that road?

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:36.009
But what's the point?

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:38.449
The point is, is that where there's a rule,

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:39.969
we don't have to think generally.

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:43.889
We may not like the rule, but we generally know what to do.

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.370
But it takes greater effort if there is no rule

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.689
or the more ambiguous the situation becomes.

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:55.169
Thus the need for spiritual maturity.

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:56.810
So at least our second point is that

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.050
is how do we go about using principles

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.969
to help us make decisions?

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:01.810
And we know we should.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.289
We're told all the time to do that, but how do we do it?

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:09.530
Well, first, we have to identify Bible principles

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.930
that fit our situation.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.770
That doesn't mean just grabbing the first scriptures

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.849
that come to mind or gathering scriptures

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.649
to support what we think should be done.

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:23.649
No, determining what principles apply to this situation.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.769
Now, how do we do that?

00:04:26.769 --> 00:04:29.290
Well, depending on the complexity of our situation,

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.170
our decision, it takes time.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.370
It takes research, meditation, prayer,

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.329
may mean writing things down in a notebook

00:04:38.329 --> 00:04:40.569
and thinking about it over time.

00:04:41.649 --> 00:04:43.009
But now, here's a question.

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:47.209
What if you are struggling to find a principle

00:04:47.209 --> 00:04:51.610
to deal with the decision you're facing right now?

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.970
Well, here is one that you can start with

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.610
and it works every time.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.290
Let's look at Matthew, chapter 22.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.009
And we're very familiar with this.

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.370
Matthew 22, 37 through 39.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.449
Remember the man came and asked Jesus,

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:07.089
give me the greatest law.

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:09.769
Give me the greatest commandment in the law.

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:11.370
What did Jesus say?

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.209
Matthew 22, 37.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.649
You must love Jehovah your God

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:19.689
with your whole heart and with your whole soul

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:21.290
and with your whole mind.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.170
This is the greatest in the first commandment.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:25.850
The second like it is this.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.569
You must love your neighbor as yourself.

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:33.769
So here Jesus in his perfect economy of words

00:05:33.769 --> 00:05:36.689
gave us who we need to consider

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:38.689
while making a decision.

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:43.170
And the order of priority in which the way the options.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.930
So first of who do we have to consider?

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.410
Well, obviously we say Jehovah and our neighbor,

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.250
but you notice that's not all.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.569
It says Jehovah our neighbor and ourselves.

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:55.850
And also what is the order of priority?

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.089
Well, obviously Jehovah is the first priority.

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:02.410
And then generally we put love of neighbor ahead of our self

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.490
because we consider our neighbor superior to us

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.490
another principle.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.290
But you notice this says love your neighbor as your self.

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.170
So that means there may be times when we have to weigh

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.170
how this affects me a little bit ahead of my neighbor.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.050
Love Jehovah, love my neighbor, love myself.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.930
So how does doing this or not doing this?

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:32.009
So how do these options reflect on my relationship

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:34.610
with Jehovah or affect my relationship with Jehovah?

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:39.370
How do these options affect Jehovah's name in the community?

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.370
How does doing this or not doing this

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.610
or these options affect my neighbor?

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.730
Who are my neighbors that are affected by this decision?

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:51.449
Remembering that our closest neighbor is our family members.

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:55.689
How does doing this or not doing this affect me?

00:06:55.689 --> 00:06:58.970
So as a test, I encourage you to take whatever decision,

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.209
whatever situation that you may be struggling with right now

00:07:03.209 --> 00:07:07.569
and prayerfully use this principle as a starting point.

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:10.970
And you may be amazed at the clarity it gives you

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:15.089
and the other principles that it opens up to guide you.

00:07:15.089 --> 00:07:16.730
Well, what's the point?

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.730
The point is that principles can help us make decisions

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.089
when things are unclear.

00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:25.730
But we need spiritual maturity.

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:29.769
And frankly, now is the time that we have to grow

00:07:29.769 --> 00:07:32.810
to spiritual maturity so that we can make decisions

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.970
based on Bible principles.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:35.889
Why?

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:37.850
Well, because as we get deeper and deeper

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.089
into the time of the end, we know it out

00:07:40.089 --> 00:07:43.529
are going to face situations that are more complicated,

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:47.930
more challenging, and we may even be on our own.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:50.889
For example, what happens if we're cut off

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:52.810
from our brothers and sisters?

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:57.810
Or we are in uncharted times as we've been in this past year.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.009
What do we do then?

00:08:00.009 --> 00:08:03.410
Well, we will be just fine if we have Jehovah's Spirit

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:06.050
and spiritual maturity.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.649
But that leads to our third question.

00:08:07.649 --> 00:08:10.730
And that is what Bible example gives us confidence

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:15.730
that we can face even naughty and complicated decisions.

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:19.490
Well, the prophet Daniel provides such a comforting example

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:20.649
for us.

00:08:20.649 --> 00:08:23.689
We know that in the early part of Daniel,

00:08:23.689 --> 00:08:26.970
he had his three Hebrew companions with him

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.290
to bounce ideas and thoughts off of.

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:32.490
But we notice there's no mention of them later on

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.090
in the book of Daniel.

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:35.889
What would he do then?

00:08:35.889 --> 00:08:39.889
Well, Daniel had very difficult decisions to navigate.

00:08:39.889 --> 00:08:42.730
In fact, turn if you will, the Daniel chapter 5 and verse 12

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:46.049
and it gives us an inkling of what he had to deal with.

00:08:46.049 --> 00:08:51.049
Daniel 5 and verse 12, it says Daniel had an extraordinary spirit

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:55.370
and knowledge and insight to interpret dreams,

00:08:55.409 --> 00:08:59.610
to explain riddles and to solve naughty problems.

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.009
Oh my, he could solve naughty problems.

00:09:02.009 --> 00:09:04.409
Can you imagine if we could solve naughty problems

00:09:04.409 --> 00:09:07.210
or as the footnote says, untie knots?

00:09:08.129 --> 00:09:11.370
Well, what naughty problems did Daniel have to deal with

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.370
when he was there in Babylon?

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:14.490
Well, we don't know all of them,

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.529
but the few of them that we do know

00:09:16.529 --> 00:09:19.769
were incredibly difficult and serious.

00:09:19.769 --> 00:09:20.610
How did he do it?

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.490
How did he make good decisions?

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:25.330
Well, Daniel was a spiritual man.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.210
He had a depth of spiritual maturity.

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.450
We know he was a man of prayer.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:32.649
So much so that almost got him killed

00:09:32.649 --> 00:09:35.049
when the law said he wasn't allowed to pray.

00:09:35.049 --> 00:09:36.049
He kept praying anyway.

00:09:36.049 --> 00:09:38.730
He relied on Jehovah, on Jehovah's Spirit.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:42.049
Daniel was also a student of the Bible.

00:09:42.049 --> 00:09:44.610
Remember in Daniel chapter 9 and verse 2,

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:47.169
it says that he discerned from his reading

00:09:47.169 --> 00:09:50.970
and examining the sacred books when the 70 years would end.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:54.169
So he would read God's word and benefit from it.

00:09:55.129 --> 00:09:57.529
At Daniel chapter 5 and verse 11 says,

00:09:57.529 --> 00:10:02.169
at Daniel had the spirit of the holy gods.

00:10:02.169 --> 00:10:04.330
Yes, because of spiritual maturity,

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.690
he was guided by holy spirit

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.009
and he was able to make difficult decisions

00:10:09.009 --> 00:10:11.529
even though he may have been cut off

00:10:11.529 --> 00:10:13.250
or he may have been alone.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:17.250
So may each one of us be determined to work hard

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.570
to press on to spiritual maturity,

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:24.129
train ourselves to think in terms of principles

00:10:24.409 --> 00:10:27.809
rather than rules and how these can guide our life.

00:10:27.809 --> 00:10:30.009
And if we do, which Jehovah's help,

00:10:30.009 --> 00:10:31.769
we too will be able to navigate

00:10:31.769 --> 00:10:36.450
whatever naughty problems we face in these last days.
