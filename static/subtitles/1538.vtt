00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.219
Having a spiritually strong family

00:00:04.219 --> 00:00:08.220
prepares us also for other changes in life.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.820
Perhaps you are in your teens

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.619
and you're starting to notice

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:14.419
those of the opposite sex.

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:15.820
Such emotions are natural

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.420
and are part of growing up.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.820
But if you're not old enough to get married,

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.219
what do you need to keep in mind?

00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:26.219
This young sister made wise decisions

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:29.019
with the loving help of her parents.

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:43.390
Hi, yours.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.189
Yeah, thanks.

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:46.390
You're Lily, right?

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.289
Yeah, and you're Sean.

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:49.789
Yeah, I've seen you around.

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:52.490
You play a good basketball.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.990
Thanks.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.590
How do you?

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.590
So you want to hang out some time?

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.590
Sure.

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.560
My name is Lily, and I sort of have this problem.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.260
There's a boy named Sean that recently moved to our school.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
I know I'm not supposed to like anyone who's not a witness.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.959
The trouble was he is a witness.

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:24.760
Sean and his family moved into our congregation.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.760
And the more I saw of him, the more I liked him.

00:01:58.519 --> 00:02:06.019
Like I said, I had a problem.

00:02:06.019 --> 00:02:10.930
Every day I see couples my age at school.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:16.539
To me, they look happy.

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:23.770
Honestly, I wanted that happiness too.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:34.849
My parents noticed my problem too, and talked about it that night.

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.250
I'm pretty soon.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.849
I didn't feel alone anymore.

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:44.050
The next day, my mom invited me to go with her to run an errand.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.750
Afterward, we went to a little cafe.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.550
She asked me how things were going.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.550
At first, I didn't want to tell her,

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.550
but she made me feel really comfortable.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.449
So I told her my feelings for Sean,

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.250
expecting her to think bad of me.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.250
But she didn't.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.750
Everything you're feeling is naturally.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.750
I remember having the same feelings when I was your age too.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.449
Really?

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:12.750
It's true.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.050
That's just how Jehovah created us, honey.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.250
And because he created us,

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.750
he knows the best way for us to be happy.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.650
And that's all he wants for us.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.550
And that's all daddy, and I want for you too.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.050
She didn't scold me.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.849
She didn't make me feel embarrassed.

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.750
And most importantly,

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.449
she didn't seem to be in a rush.

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:41.349
My mom wasn't the only one helping me.

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:45.550
My dad was preparing to help me with my problem too.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.449
That evening, we had family worship.

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:52.349
And once again, they just let me talk.

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.849
They told me I didn't have to hold back.

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:55.949
So I didn't.

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:57.550
I just don't know what to do.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.050
Lily, thank you for telling us how you feel.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.150
Let me ask you something.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.650
Why do you think Jehovah created us

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.750
with these natural feelings toward the opposite sex?

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.550
So that one day a man or woman can marry.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:14.750
That's right.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.649
In fact, a good marriage is like two skaters on the ice.

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:22.750
A beautiful performance can seem effortless,

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.149
but is it really?

00:04:24.149 --> 00:04:25.149
No.

00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:28.550
No one would even attempt that without practice,

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.649
a capable partner, or the right kind of guidance, right?

00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:33.649
Yeah.

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:37.149
Well, it's the same with a good marriage, sweetie.

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:39.149
It doesn't just happen.

00:04:39.149 --> 00:04:43.350
It, too, depends on a good partner.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.149
Coordinated effort.

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:50.649
But most importantly, wise counsel from Jehovah.

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:53.350
In fact, could you please turn with me

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:59.050
to Psalm chapter 32 and verse 8 and read that for us?

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.649
Sure.

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:04.850
It says, I will give you insight and instruct you

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.449
in the way you should go.

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.750
I will give you advice with my eye upon you.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.649
Lily, Jehovah loves us very much.

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:16.149
And if we listen to him, we'll make good decisions

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:21.250
in our life with absolutely no regrets.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.050
We talk some more, and then I got some homework.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.350
My dad gave me some articles he printed out for me to read.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.649
So I did.

00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:36.649
And as I read the words and started meditating on them,

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:39.449
I realized something.

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:41.949
By holding off dating a little longer,

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:46.980
I wasn't missing out.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.079
Rather, I was preparing myself.

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:55.480
I could use the time now to focus on something much more important.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.980
My relationship with Jehovah.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.279
I could also gain Christian qualities

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:04.279
and experience that will help me later

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:06.279
if I ever do get married.
