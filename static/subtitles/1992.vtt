00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:09.539
And in production to the book of Galatians, the Apostle Paul wrote this letter during or

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:16.379
after his second missionary tour, either from Corinth or from Syrian Antioch.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.379
Although he usually used the secretary to write his letters, Paul himself wrote the letter

00:00:21.379 --> 00:00:34.409
to the Galatians. Galatians was written about 50 to 52 CE. Did you know? Galatia was the

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:42.090
Roman province that occupied the central portion of what is now known as Asia Minor. The Galatian

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.850
congregations to whom Paul wrote may have included the ones in Pesidian Antioch, Iconium,

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:57.759
Lystra, and Derby. Paul used this letter to counteract the work of false teachers who were

00:00:57.759 --> 00:01:04.799
asserting that observance of the Mosaic law was an essential part of true Christianity.

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.280
The letter to the Galatians has six chapters. In chapter 1, Paul relates his own experience

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.959
of conversion from Judaism to Christianity. He reminds the Galatians that what he has taught

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:25.150
them came through a revelation by Jesus Christ and that they should not deviate from it.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:33.150
In chapters 2 and 3, Paul reasons that works of law cannot make one righteous. He calls

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.269
the law a guardian that led people to the Christ. It is faith in Jesus that makes one righteous.

00:01:39.269 --> 00:01:47.030
Paul identifies Abraham's spiritual offspring as Christ and those who are heirs with Christ.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:54.510
The Galatians, though, are in danger of becoming enslaved to the teachings of men, Paul warns in

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:04.150
chapters 4 to 6. In chapter 4, Paul introduces a symbolic drama using the example of Hegar and

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:12.349
Sarah and their children, Ishmael and Isaac. Hegar and Ishmael correspond with enslaved earthly

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:20.550
Jerusalem and her children or citizens. Sarah and Isaac correspond with the Jerusalem above,

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.870
the heavenly part of Jehovah's organization, and her children, the spirit anointed and free

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:38.000
sons of God. That freedom, however, should not be used as an excuse to pursue a sinful course, Paul

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.159
cautions. He contrasts the works of the flesh with the fruitage of God's spirit and he teaches

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:56.080
that we reap what we sow. As you read the letter to the Galatians, note how Christians can be

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.280
declared righteous only by means of faith. How those who display the fruitage of God's spirit

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:09.840
reap benefits and how Abraham's spiritual offspring are identified as Christ Jesus and the joint

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.879
heirs of his everlasting kingdom.
