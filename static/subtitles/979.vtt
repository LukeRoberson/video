00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.980
For this part of the symposium, share the good news of peace.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.980
We're going to discuss the need to take the initiative.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.980
Now, we're going to look at why we should take the initiative,

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.980
how to take the initiative, and then concluding thought about

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.980
who's helping and directing us in our preaching work.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.980
Now, first of all, why take the initiative?

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.979
Well, think about it.

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:38.979
One thing about being Jehovah's Witnesses is that we're never off duty.

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:45.979
We never stop being one of Jehovah's Witnesses, wherever we are, whatever we're doing.

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:51.979
So it isn't just that when we're out in formal preaching work with congregation group,

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:56.979
we are one of Jehovah's Witnesses all the time.

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:03.979
There's no such thing as being off duty when we're one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:11.980
Now, to give you an idea of how significant this is with informal witnessing,

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.980
let me tell you a statistic, a survey was taken some years ago,

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.980
and you'll be surprised possibly.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.980
In one group of over 200 baptized witnesses,

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:31.980
now notice over 40% had been contacted by informal witnessing.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.980
Isn't that amazing?

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.980
So the door to door is crucial, of course,

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.980
during COVID that's been inhibited,

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.980
the letter writing has its place, the phone witnessing,

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.980
but the point is there's other times where we can do some witnessing informally.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.980
Now, let's examine how to do it,

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:00.980
and the best example of how to do informal witnessing is, of course, Christ Jesus.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.980
And there's an account all of us are familiar with in the Bible book of John,

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.979
so please find John chapter 4,

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.979
and we're going to take a look at how Jesus took the initiative,

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:20.979
and then imitate him to do just as he did.

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:23.979
Now, notice here in John chapter 4,

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:28.979
we get the context that they've been traveling through Samaria,

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:32.979
and then verse 6 will read,

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:35.979
in fact, Jacob's well was there.

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:41.979
Now, Jesus tired out as he was from the journey was sitting at the well.

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:44.979
It was about the sixth hour.

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:47.979
Now, that's interesting, is it not?

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:53.979
See, Jesus was tired, perfect man, but human,

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:56.979
and his journey tired him out,

00:02:56.979 --> 00:03:00.979
and he's there about noon sitting at the well,

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:02.979
and notice what happens.

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:04.979
And verse 7,

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:08.979
a woman of Samaria came to draw water.

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:10.979
Jesus said to her,

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:12.979
give me a drink.

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:16.449
Real simple.

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:18.449
Give me a drink.

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:20.449
Well, what did we learn from this?

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:23.449
As you notice, Jesus was tired.

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:28.449
We get tired because of being imperfect.

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:31.449
If a perfect man gets tired out, certainly we get tired.

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:33.449
Sometimes you get feeling,

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:37.449
maybe I could witness to this person take the initiative,

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:39.449
but I just don't feel like it.

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:41.449
I'm tired.

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:43.449
Not with Jesus.

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:48.449
See, to imitate Jesus even in a case that you're tired,

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:50.449
you're thinking of others,

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:54.449
and you want to take the opportunity to start a conversation.

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:56.449
That's the initial goal.

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:59.449
Now, notice something else here that we learn

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:03.449
in the ninth verse of John, chapter 4.

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:07.889
So the Samaritan woman said to him,

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:09.889
how is it that you,

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:13.889
despite being a Jew, ask me for a drink,

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:16.889
even though I am a Samaritan woman?

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.889
And then we learn more here,

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.889
parentheses for Jews,

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:23.889
have no dealings with Samaritan.

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.889
And it went both ways.

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.889
That's the way the prejudice was,

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:29.889
no dealings.

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.889
And on top of that, she's a woman.

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.889
And women were not treated very nice during that period

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.889
in man's history.

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:40.889
So she's a Samaritan.

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:42.889
She's a woman.

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.889
And Jesus asks her for a drink.

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.889
Starts a conversation with her.

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:51.889
Now, these are the things we learn with this.

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.889
He didn't make any assumptions about her.

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:57.889
And obviously new.

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:59.889
See, it was a woman,

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.889
and a Samaritan, a traveling through Samaritan at that time.

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:09.889
And he didn't refuse to speak to her because of that.

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:12.889
So the lesson for us there is,

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.889
don't judge people by what you see,

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:18.889
based on their culture,

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:20.889
color of their skin.

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:23.889
This world is filled with judges.

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:25.889
Where's your hooves' witnesses?

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:27.889
We don't do that.

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.889
We leave the judging to Jehovah in Jesus Christ.

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:34.889
And don't judge whether you think they'll converse with you.

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:36.889
That's wrong.

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:38.889
Jesus didn't do that.

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:42.889
And he set that perfect example for us.

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:43.889
Go ahead.

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:46.889
And then if you're a little nervous about it,

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:49.889
then we beg Jehovah for his spirit to help us,

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:52.889
to give us the courage to witness about

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.889
his beautiful name and purposes.

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:01.889
Now, he also teaches us something else interesting here.

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:03.889
And this is where taking the initiative,

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:06.889
you start a conversation,

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:09.889
you don't rush into things.

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:13.889
Now notice how you see we read verse 9,

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:16.889
and then they had this conversation take place

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:20.889
through these following verses here.

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:24.889
They get to verse 24 where he mentions God's spirit

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:27.889
and must worship him with spirit and truth.

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:29.889
And now here's what happens.

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:34.889
They had this fine conversation after simply asking for a drink.

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:36.889
Notice verse 25,

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:38.889
the woman said to him,

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:42.889
I know that Messiah is coming who is called Christ.

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:44.889
Whenever that one comes,

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:48.889
he will declare all things to us openly.

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:51.889
She spoke out of her heart.

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:53.889
Notice verse 26,

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:55.889
Jesus said to her,

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:58.889
I am He,

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:00.889
the one speaking to you.

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:02.889
What a moment.

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:07.889
And she's blessed with having the Messiah Himself speak to her.

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:11.889
However, give some thought.

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:14.889
What if Jesus rather than say,

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:16.889
give me a drink, start it off with,

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:19.889
I am the Messiah.

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:22.889
Give me a drink.

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:26.889
Don't know because Jesus had Jehovah's spirit

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:28.889
and heavenly wisdom.

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:30.889
And He entered the conversation first.

00:07:30.889 --> 00:07:32.889
So that's what we want to keep in mind

00:07:32.889 --> 00:07:34.889
and try to do ourselves.

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:36.889
They have a conversation.

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:40.889
It might just be speaking from your heart

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:43.889
and trying to engage the person.

00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:45.889
For example,

00:07:45.889 --> 00:07:48.889
you could be in the doctor's office waiting room.

00:07:48.889 --> 00:07:50.889
So you speak from your heart

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:54.889
and you notice the person's looking at you and said,

00:07:54.889 --> 00:07:59.889
I look forward to the day I'll never be sick again.

00:07:59.889 --> 00:08:01.889
Well,

00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:03.889
they could look at you and say,

00:08:03.889 --> 00:08:06.889
well, this guy is crazy

00:08:06.889 --> 00:08:08.889
or they could say,

00:08:08.889 --> 00:08:10.889
well, that would be nice

00:08:10.889 --> 00:08:12.889
or what makes you believe

00:08:12.889 --> 00:08:15.889
either way you're starting taking the initiative

00:08:15.889 --> 00:08:18.889
to start a conversation

00:08:18.889 --> 00:08:20.889
and leave the rest to Jehovah.

00:08:20.889 --> 00:08:23.889
He's the one that gets the credit

00:08:23.889 --> 00:08:25.889
for the results.

00:08:25.889 --> 00:08:28.889
Now, next we have a video here.

00:08:28.889 --> 00:08:30.889
Now as you watch the following video,

00:08:30.889 --> 00:08:32.889
notice how a sister finds

00:08:32.889 --> 00:08:35.889
an effective way

00:08:35.889 --> 00:08:37.889
to witness informally.

00:08:37.889 --> 00:09:02.840
They seem nice.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.840
I knew what Judy was thinking.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.840
I wanted to start a conversation,

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.840
but I didn't want to bother them either.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:23.429
And when an opportunity came,

00:09:23.429 --> 00:09:38.870
I just froze.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:54.990
Then I was in a rush to give a witness.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:10:04.870
It felt forced.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:07.870
It helped to hear that with all been there,

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:09.870
our past experiences were similar.

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:19.820
Whenever we didn't put pressure on ourselves

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:23.820
and just looked for something in common to talk about,

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.820
we could usually find a moment

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:28.820
when we could say something about the Bible.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:31.820
She was curious why we were dressed up.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:35.220
Turns out that she'd never talked

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.220
to Jehovah's Witnesses before.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:50.639
So how we appreciated how she took the initiative.

00:10:50.639 --> 00:10:52.639
Of course, you see the contrast there

00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:54.639
that at one point she froze.

00:10:54.639 --> 00:10:56.639
So it is stressful,

00:10:56.639 --> 00:10:58.639
no doubt about it,

00:10:58.639 --> 00:11:00.639
or only human.

00:11:00.639 --> 00:11:02.639
But then she rushed into things,

00:11:02.639 --> 00:11:04.639
running after it with the track.

00:11:04.639 --> 00:11:06.639
See, give us some thought.

00:11:06.639 --> 00:11:08.639
Try to have the conversation,

00:11:08.639 --> 00:11:10.639
then let the spirit move it,

00:11:10.639 --> 00:11:13.639
and that would be imitating Jesus.

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:15.639
Then it can move into getting

00:11:15.639 --> 00:11:18.639
into the spiritual purpose

00:11:18.639 --> 00:11:20.639
of initiating the conversation.

00:11:20.639 --> 00:11:22.639
So good example.

00:11:22.639 --> 00:11:24.639
Give it a try, brothers and sisters,

00:11:24.639 --> 00:11:27.639
and let Jehovah bless your efforts.

00:11:27.639 --> 00:11:30.639
Now, to conclude,

00:11:30.639 --> 00:11:33.639
I think to want to share this beautiful thought,

00:11:33.639 --> 00:11:36.639
when it comes to this work we're engaging in

00:11:36.639 --> 00:11:38.639
and sharing the good news of peace

00:11:38.639 --> 00:11:40.639
by taking the initiative,

00:11:40.639 --> 00:11:42.639
never forget this.

00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:44.639
And you know it, but it's a good reminder,

00:11:44.639 --> 00:11:47.639
Revelation chapter 14.

00:11:47.639 --> 00:11:51.639
And here in the Revelation,

00:11:52.639 --> 00:11:55.639
familiar to most of you listening

00:11:55.639 --> 00:11:57.639
in verse 6,

00:11:57.639 --> 00:11:59.639
let's read it.

00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:02.639
And I saw another angel flying in mid-Heaven,

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:05.639
and he had ever lasting good news to declare

00:12:05.639 --> 00:12:07.639
to those who dwell on the earth,

00:12:07.639 --> 00:12:10.639
to every nation and tribe,

00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:12.639
and tongue and people.

00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:15.639
Now, this is profound.

00:12:15.639 --> 00:12:18.639
Obviously, angel flying in mid-Heaven,

00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:20.639
the footnote helps us

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:23.639
where it's overhead,

00:12:23.639 --> 00:12:25.639
where the birds fly.

00:12:25.639 --> 00:12:27.639
You see them and see

00:12:27.639 --> 00:12:29.639
another angel in mid-Heaven.

00:12:29.639 --> 00:12:32.639
That's how close they are.

00:12:32.639 --> 00:12:35.639
And this is something you want to meditate on.

00:12:35.639 --> 00:12:38.639
Personally, when I was in the traveling work,

00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:41.639
sometimes I'd be working with one of the brothers

00:12:41.639 --> 00:12:43.639
or one of the sisters,

00:12:43.639 --> 00:12:47.639
and they had opposition

00:12:47.639 --> 00:12:49.639
and some of the territories we'd work,

00:12:49.639 --> 00:12:52.639
and I could tell they were feeling the stress,

00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:55.639
and I know it was the reaction

00:12:55.639 --> 00:12:57.639
of some of these householders.

00:12:57.639 --> 00:12:59.639
So what I used to enjoy doing

00:12:59.639 --> 00:13:02.639
and they appreciated after they realized

00:13:02.639 --> 00:13:04.639
what I was doing.

00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:05.639
We'd be walking along,

00:13:05.639 --> 00:13:06.639
and then I'd just stop,

00:13:06.639 --> 00:13:07.639
and I'd look up,

00:13:07.639 --> 00:13:08.639
and I'd say,

00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:10.639
you see them?

00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:11.639
And they're like,

00:13:11.639 --> 00:13:13.639
who?

00:13:13.639 --> 00:13:15.639
You're right up there above the trees,

00:13:15.639 --> 00:13:17.639
and they'd look at me,

00:13:17.639 --> 00:13:20.639
and our circuit overseers lost it.

00:13:20.639 --> 00:13:22.639
But I said, see,

00:13:22.639 --> 00:13:25.639
and we'll tell them about Revelation 146.

00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:27.639
When we're in the preaching work,

00:13:27.639 --> 00:13:29.639
whether it's informal,

00:13:29.639 --> 00:13:30.639
or out there,

00:13:30.639 --> 00:13:32.639
formally door to door,

00:13:32.639 --> 00:13:35.639
the angels are the real reapers.

00:13:35.639 --> 00:13:38.639
At least one is nearby.

00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:40.639
What a profound thought.

00:13:40.639 --> 00:13:43.639
They are the real harvesters.

00:13:43.639 --> 00:13:45.639
They are the ones directing us

00:13:45.639 --> 00:13:48.639
or the rightly disposed people.

00:13:48.639 --> 00:13:50.639
Don't ever forget that.

00:13:50.639 --> 00:13:52.639
When it comes to being ready

00:13:52.639 --> 00:13:54.639
to share the good news of peace,

00:13:54.639 --> 00:13:57.639
you go ahead and take the initiative

00:13:57.639 --> 00:13:59.639
to start conversations.

00:13:59.639 --> 00:14:02.639
You'll have valuable opportunities

00:14:02.639 --> 00:14:08.460
to share the good news of peace.

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:09.460
Brother Gary Brow,

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:12.460
a helper to the Service Committee,

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:15.460
will now present the next talk of this symposium.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:18.460
Be ready to share the good news of peace.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.460
Follow-up on interest.
