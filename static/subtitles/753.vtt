00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:08.619
The young man, he received his assignment, and it was not for the faint of heart.

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:14.500
He would have to tell the desolation of cherished cities, the burning of Jehovah's temple,

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:22.699
the captivity of his people, and for delivering these messages, which they were not easy,

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:29.980
he would endure scathing and murderous attempts on his life.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:41.219
Now on top of that, he would experience moments of discouragement, isolation, self-doubt.

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.460
When receiving his assignment, this young man said, Jehovah, I cannot do this.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.380
I'm just a boy.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:59.899
The boy was from Anifath, and his name was Jeremiah.

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.740
So what would help him be successful with this assignment?

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.939
It would be following and taking to heart the very points that Brother Flegal brought

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.620
out about faith.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.260
He would need deep abiding faith and trust in Jehovah.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:23.579
And in addition to that, he would need to learn how to march.

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:29.700
Jeremiah was ready to enter the front lines of the battle.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.060
The battle to defend pure worship against those who hate it.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:42.799
And like any good soldier, one of the first things you learn is how to march.

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.840
Now marching is more challenging than mere walking.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.120
Marching requires determination.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:02:01.200
It requires stamina, endurance, and to keep moving forward in a regular steady step.

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:10.909
And as Jeremiah entered this battle, he would need to learn how to march.

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:12.229
What would help him?

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:16.469
Recalling what was written in God's words, centuries before his time.

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:19.949
Words recorded at Deuteronomy chapter 31 and verse 6.

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:23.789
I want to read these words to you.

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:26.550
These words were so important to Jeremiah.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.270
The context was when Moses was encouraging confidence in Jehovah.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.669
The nation of Israel was ready to enter into the promised land.

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:36.909
They would face enemies.

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.949
They would face a fight, a battle.

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:46.150
But look what Moses says in verse 6 of Deuteronomy 31.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.669
Be courageous and strong.

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:52.349
Do not be afraid or struck with terror before them.

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:58.270
Or Jehovah, your God is the one marching with you.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.750
He's marching with you.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.460
He will neither desert or abandon you.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.819
So how did Jehovah march alongside this boy?

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.900
At Jeremiah chapter 1 and verse 8, Jehovah tells Jeremiah,

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.819
do not be afraid because of their appearance.

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.180
For I am with you to save you.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.180
Don't be afraid.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:33.060
In other words, when a person marches with Jehovah, you see Jehovah marches with him,

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.460
boosting him along, making him strong.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:43.270
It's as if Jehovah told Jeremiah, don't worry, you just come and march with me.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.030
And for the next 67 years, that's exactly what Jeremiah did.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.430
In Jehovah's strength, think about what happened.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.750
In Jehovah's strength, Jeremiah preached to hard-hearted people, including wicked kings,

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.750
corrupt priests, apostates.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:59.990
He did it.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.669
And as he marched, he saw Jehovah march with him.

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:08.379
He was conscious of that fact.

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:13.740
Jehovah saved him when imprisoned in a dungeon.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.500
Jehovah supplied him a daily ration of food during a famine.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.420
Jehovah rescued him from a cistern.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.860
You see, this is real.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.220
This was tangible.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.220
This was concrete.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.339
It wasn't made up.

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:29.339
Jehovah was marching with him.

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:33.819
And as Jeremiah saw Jehovah's support, it strengthened him.

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:36.180
It gave him more confidence.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.779
And Jehovah marched with him.

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:43.100
And then, Jeremiah was ready then for the next trial.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.459
Why do we bring this up?

00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:52.060
Because your situation is very similar to Jeremiah's household.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:58.220
Along with your Gilead training, you are being put on the front lines.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:04.220
You're going to be asked to defend pure worship, maybe like you never have before.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.500
So we want you to stay in the battle.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.500
We want you to keep marching.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:18.259
For example, what if in your assignment opposition turns into outright persecution?

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:24.899
Or what if in your branch territory you face a political upheaval or war?

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:35.579
What if you need to risk your lives to provide relief like our brothers in and around Ukraine

00:05:35.579 --> 00:05:36.579
are doing?

00:05:36.579 --> 00:05:39.860
What if that happens?

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.540
Your brothers will be looking to you as an example.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.779
Will you be able to set that example?

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:47.540
Can you maintain that example?

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.089
Yes, you can.

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:56.649
Because when you march with Jehovah, now listen carefully.

00:05:56.649 --> 00:06:04.410
When you march with Jehovah, he does something very special for you in moments of weakness.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.329
Well, consider what happened to Jeremiah.

00:06:08.329 --> 00:06:11.250
At one point it got so bad he wanted to quit.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.250
I'm quitting.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.170
Jeremiah, chapter 20, verse 9.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:15.970
I'm not going to mention Jehovah's name.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.930
I'm not going to talk about it anymore.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:18.930
I'm discouraged.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:19.930
I'm tired.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:20.930
I'm exhausted.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.009
I'm going to stop marching.

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:27.649
He was losing his focus.

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:29.050
So how does Jehovah help him?

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.370
What did Jehovah do?

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.089
Did he say, well, Jeremiah, that's it.

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:35.529
If you're going to be exhausted, I'll find another prophet.

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:38.649
No, Jehovah did not do that.

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:40.209
What did Jehovah do?

00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:42.329
And this is a thought we want you to take to heart.

00:06:42.329 --> 00:06:52.790
Jeremiah, chapter 20, and verse 11, how does Jehovah help him to keep marching?

00:06:52.790 --> 00:07:00.149
But Jehovah was with me, like a, what, friend, like a brother?

00:07:00.149 --> 00:07:05.069
No, no, no, like a fearsome warrior.

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:11.189
So in what way did Jehovah prove to be a fearsome warrior, a mighty soldier standing right

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:14.899
at Jeremiah's side?

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.860
How did Jehovah do that?

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.500
Well, what happens in battle?

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.740
When a soldier sees a fellow soldier's thumbel and fall, what does he do?

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.259
He rushes to his side.

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:27.259
He supports him.

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:28.259
He grabs him.

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:31.939
They go together, wraps his arm around him, and they move to safety together.

00:07:31.939 --> 00:07:36.949
This is what Jehovah did for Jeremiah.

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:43.269
In fact, Jeremiah tells us this in chapter 20 and in verse 7, what does Jeremiah say?

00:07:43.269 --> 00:07:45.550
He experienced this.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:53.350
He says, you used your strength against me and you prevail.

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:54.990
You used your strength against me.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:58.379
What does that mean?

00:07:58.379 --> 00:08:06.500
Jehovah used his strength against Jeremiah's weakness, seeing Jehovah do this for him time

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:11.939
and again, time and again, enabled Jeremiah to accomplish what he could have never accomplished

00:08:11.939 --> 00:08:14.459
on his own.

00:08:14.459 --> 00:08:16.620
This is the point we're making for you.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:23.180
And all of these experience, strength, and it transformed his natural shyness, his feelings

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:29.540
of inadequacy, his lack of confidence into iron-like boldness.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.939
Jehovah was with him like a fearsome warrior.

00:08:31.939 --> 00:08:35.659
Jehovah loved the commission he gave Jeremiah.

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:38.539
He was working with Jeremiah to fulfill this commission.

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:43.259
It was precious to Jehovah, just like your commission.

00:08:43.259 --> 00:08:46.860
It's precious to Jehovah.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.419
So you can be assured that Jehovah is going to do the same for you.

00:08:50.419 --> 00:08:53.700
We want you to have that confidence.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:09:04.179
In fact, one sister, who not long ago graduated from Gilead, experienced this first hand.

00:09:04.179 --> 00:09:09.179
Shortly after arriving in her assignment, she was arrested.

00:09:09.179 --> 00:09:14.179
Our sister was held captive in a dungeon-like prison.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:21.779
And during that time, she was given meager rations of food and was subjected to painful, prolonged punishment.

00:09:21.779 --> 00:09:23.500
How was she able to endure?

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.299
How could she stay strong?

00:09:25.299 --> 00:09:29.100
How by marching with Jehovah?

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:33.460
And she never lost sight of the fact that she was part of an army of marchers.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:36.860
She was marching with the fearsome warrior.

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:44.610
In fact, this is what she said, thinking about my Gilead classmates

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:49.649
and visualizing their faces gave me power.

00:09:49.649 --> 00:09:53.570
I kept their smiling faces in front of me.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:10:00.049
I imagined where each class made sad, each row from left to right, front to back.

00:10:00.049 --> 00:10:05.289
I recalled where they were from, what work they did in their assignments.

00:10:05.289 --> 00:10:10.330
This made the time go by quickly and I felt no physical pain at all.

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:14.049
I sang in my head, kingdom songs.

00:10:14.049 --> 00:10:18.490
The song I sang the most was Jehovah's Your Name.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:23.649
Another song that touched my heart deeply was song number 38.

00:10:23.649 --> 00:10:26.210
He will make you strong.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:33.490
I made that song more personal by replacing the pronoun you with me.

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:38.600
This song helped me never to give up.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.639
I had no Bible.

00:10:40.679 --> 00:10:47.279
So each day I meditated on Bible teaching such as everlasting life and paradise and a resurrection hope.

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:54.919
These meditations gave me deep inner joy and a calm that cannot be described.

00:10:54.919 --> 00:10:58.879
At times I thought about the possibility of facing death,

00:10:58.879 --> 00:11:04.940
but the fear of death did not consume me.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:08.539
Yes, she thought about the possibility of facing death,

00:11:08.539 --> 00:11:14.299
but the fear of death did not consume me.

00:11:14.299 --> 00:11:17.940
The fearsome warrior Jehovah was marching with her.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:22.700
No prison walls, no bars can block Jehovah from marching with her.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:29.950
And our sister was recently released from prison.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:34.350
So whatever your trials, we don't know what trials you're going to face.

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:37.110
You don't know, we don't know.

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:41.990
But reflect on how Jehovah supports you, stay in the battle.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:47.110
And when you reflect on Jehovah, how Jehovah supports you, it's tangible, it's real, it's concrete.

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:51.710
Think about that, Jehovah will never stop marching with you.

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:55.350
And remember, you are a part of a large army.

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:58.429
You're not alone.

00:11:58.429 --> 00:12:03.870
Therefore, when you see a fellow worshipper struggling, don't ignore them.

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.269
Help them, not to fall behind.

00:12:06.269 --> 00:12:07.710
Help them.

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:08.990
Help them.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:11.070
You're part of an army.

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:13.190
You've been trained to do this.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.870
That's what school taught you.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:18.509
Not to be independent, but to be interdependent.

00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:23.389
Not independent, interdependent with your brothers and sisters.

00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:25.669
That's your job.

00:12:25.669 --> 00:12:30.629
Be quick to help them back up, keep marching with Jehovah.

00:12:30.629 --> 00:12:35.669
And although you don't know what challenges lie ahead,

00:12:35.669 --> 00:12:38.269
you are prepared.

00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:44.669
So with your marching orders in hand, be courageous and strong.

00:12:44.669 --> 00:12:48.429
Knowing that each trial you face, each trial you endure,

00:12:48.429 --> 00:12:51.950
will make you stronger for the next one.

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:55.870
Be confident, you'll always have the fearsome warrior,

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:59.669
the mighty soldier marching by your side.

00:12:59.669 --> 00:13:03.029
He's there, Jehovah.

00:13:03.029 --> 00:13:05.870
So now go.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:09.950
Wherever the battle may take you, go.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:15.870
And be determined to fulfill your commission to support your brothers,

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:18.950
as you march on with Jehovah.
