00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.880
Hey everyone, Brooke here, guess who just walked in?

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.279
Olivia, and there's Jake, would she ever?

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:14.880
No, she wouldn't ever, she's meanless.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.920
It feels out of your control, doesn't it?

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.719
Remember when we studied about the Shula Mike girl?

00:00:22.719 --> 00:00:27.070
Who was really in control?

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.670
She was?

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.269
You have the same power.

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:36.070
If you believe that, it'll change how you handle the pressure.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.070
My peace comes from doing the right thing.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.070
I am a wall.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.469
You're just a coward.

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.469
Take a trash.

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.869
Think about what the jailer had done to Paul.

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:51.869
He could have hated him for it.

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:55.869
Yeah, he could have, but I guess he saw the jailer's pain

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:58.670
instead of just his own.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.469
Let me show you just one scripture.

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.469
Probably one scripture.

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.069
Jehovah has taught us to love.

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:15.500
And he's given our family peace.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.700
Hello everyone, Haley from Genoa Design here.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.500
You don't think she's showing off?

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.299
Is this just about Haley?

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.930
Can you believe how?

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.530
I haven't seen you all her posts.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.329
If Celia agrees that Haley's doing something she shouldn't,

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.530
you should talk to her.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.129
I've noticed you were posts lately on QuickPost.

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:39.329
What about them?

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.329
Some people might think you're bragging.

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:42.930
Who would think like that?

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:43.730
You.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:44.730
I didn't want to upset you.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:45.730
Jake said that I needed to take.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.730
Jake said everyone.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.129
Things my posts are in a boat.

00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:50.730
It's not what I'm saying at all.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.980
You are such.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.579
Think back to a time when you wanted forgiveness.

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:05.579
Love is patience and kind.

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.580
It's not jealous.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.379
I'm sorry, Haley.

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.780
Genuine affection fights peace rakers.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.780
And affection grows when we really know

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.860
our brothers and sisters well.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.860
I was always impressed with how close you two were.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:35.020
Well, it wasn't always that way.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.419
But started as a small disagreement, exploded.

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:43.030
You, you're the problem.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.229
I needed a lot of help from Jehovah

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:48.430
to make things right with Nick.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.229
There was a misunderstanding.

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:54.030
I've not gone all out of proportion.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.430
And I didn't handle it the best.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.830
That's when our peace was really put to the test.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.430
The body decided unanimously that you should no longer serve.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.830
You pushed them.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.830
Phil didn't know just how tense things were between Tim and I.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.629
I found comfort and accounts of Jehovah's servants.

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.430
They helped me realize that being a peace with my brothers

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.569
was more important than any appointed position.

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.569
It wasn't easy.

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.770
But we talked it out.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.169
And we were able to make peace with Jehovah's help.

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:36.370
Without peace, I don't know how we could have managed

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.569
what was to come.

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:45.460
At that moment, when you hear the verdict that you'll stand prison,

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.060
it's like you've been knocked unconscious.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:04:04.960
But then the doors of the elevator opened up and in front of us.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.039
That's Jehovah.

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:10.639
When you're just about to lose all your strength,

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:14.439
Jehovah does that something for you.

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:17.639
The Russian brothers and sisters, I pray for them constantly

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:31.029
because they aren't going through a very tough time.

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:33.629
What I've learned from all of this

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:38.029
is peace isn't from what's outside,

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:41.629
from what's going on or what you're experiencing.

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:45.629
I've learned that peace is on the inside

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:48.629
and that comes from Jehovah.
