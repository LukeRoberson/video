00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.819
Thank you so much for that talk. That was wonderful. Thank you.

00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:04.820
Sergey!

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:07.820
Lixie!

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.820
Natalia!

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:10.820
Yes, it's fast!

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.640
I haven't seen you both since...

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.640
I know! It's been 17 years!

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.640
We pray for you, Lix, every night, Sergey.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.640
Thank you so much.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.640
When they announce your name as our substitute circuit, we see I couldn't believe it!

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.640
Oh, I still can't believe it.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:38.590
I wanted to meet my wife, this is Anya.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.590
Nice to meet you.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.590
Nice to meet you.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.590
Nice to meet you.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.590
Nice to meet you.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.590
Nice to meet you.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.590
Your husband studied with us.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.590
It's wonderful to meet up again after all these years.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.590
Would you both come to my home for dinner tonight?

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.590
It would be so much to us.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.590
Sounds wonderful.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.590
We would be happy to come.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.590
Thank you.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.590
Thank you.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.500
Thank you.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:19.769
That was excellent.

00:01:19.769 --> 00:01:21.769
Like your talks, Sergey.

00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:26.769
Yes, it's rare for someone so young to teach us you do.

00:01:26.769 --> 00:01:27.769
No, I don't.

00:01:27.769 --> 00:01:29.769
Feather was right.

00:01:29.769 --> 00:01:32.769
You are wise beyond your years.

00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:35.769
Do you think your time in prison prepared you?

00:01:35.769 --> 00:01:38.769
I definitely had a lot of time to meditate, so...

00:01:38.769 --> 00:01:41.769
I guess it might have matured me a little.

00:01:41.769 --> 00:01:44.769
You were there nearly twice as long as most of us.

00:01:44.769 --> 00:01:50.769
We can only imagine how difficult those years were for you.

00:01:50.769 --> 00:01:53.769
Is it true you never saw your father again?

00:01:53.769 --> 00:01:55.769
It's true.

00:01:55.769 --> 00:01:59.769
You must be very strong to withstand that kind of pressure.

00:01:59.769 --> 00:02:01.769
I suppose so.

00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:06.769
I wish you could be our real circuit overseer.

00:02:06.769 --> 00:02:09.770
We heard good things about brother Elin.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.770
Many good things. We hope to meet him soon.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.770
He is okay.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.770
But he is not the man of the people.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.770
You have suffered. Like us.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.770
You understand us?

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.770
We need someone like you.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.770
Brothers, I appreciate the praise, but I really don't deserve it.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:30.770
Yes, you do.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:31.770
No.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.770
The praise should go to Jehovah.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.770
It is only because of his power that any of us can serve him the way we do.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.770
It's true. It's only because of Jehovah's spirit.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.770
He deserves the praise.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.770
And remember,

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.770
Jehovah is the one who chooses those who serve in the congregations.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.770
Each of us has strength that others don't have,

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.770
but Jehovah sees them all.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.770
And he knows how to use them to advance his will.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:07.770
So we must trust Jehovah and be determined to appreciate the ones he has chosen to use.
