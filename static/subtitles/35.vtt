00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.589
Welcome to JW Broadcasting.

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:08.589
This month we'll consider ways we can get the most benefit from Bible principles.

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:11.589
Here are some highlights.

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:16.589
How can Bible study and meditation prepare us for trials?

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:19.589
We'll learn about the example of Sister Gertrude Putzinger

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:21.589
through an archived interview.

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:25.589
What principles and Bible accounts enabled her and her husband Martin

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:29.589
to keep their integrity in Nazi Germany?

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:32.590
Jehovah urges us to seek first the kingdom.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.590
What can happen when a person seeks things in the world instead of the kingdom?

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.590
We'll listen to how this young sister learned to trust Jehovah

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.590
and lead a life that brings true happiness.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.590
Have you ever thought that a familiar piece of Bible counsel

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.590
didn't apply to your situation?

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.590
Well, how can analyzing such counsel lead to related principles

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.590
that fit your specific challenge?

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.590
We'll see in this encouraging dramatization.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.590
You're watching JW Broadcasting for February 2017.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:31.750
You and I make a lot of decisions every day.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.750
Now, some have a little impact on our lives.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.750
Others have a very big impact.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.750
And we can appreciate that we can make choices and decisions for ourselves.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.750
Think of how life would be if you made no decisions for yourself.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.750
Someone tells you when to go to bed.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.750
They pick out your clothes and they tell you what to do for work.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.750
Well, none of us would like that.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.750
Jehovah gave each of us free will.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.750
And that's the precious gift of making choices for ourselves.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.750
Now, have you ever thought about why Jehovah gave us this gift?

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.750
I mean, why trust us with free will when he knew that we could make

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.750
bad choices or decisions?

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.750
One powerful reason is love.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.750
The only way to give us the gift of love is also to give us the gift of free will.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.750
The two are tied together.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.750
You really can't have one without the other.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.750
For example, if I program my computer,

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.750
they give me a message every day at 2 p.m.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.750
John, I love you.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.750
I think you're a wonderful guy.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.750
I think there'd be a little something wrong with me if I thought,

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.750
oh, isn't that nice?

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.750
My computer, it loves me.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.750
Yeah, love only exists if it comes truly from a free will expression.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.750
Now, did Jehovah place any boundaries on free will?

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.750
Yes, they were stated in the law to the nation of Israel.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:06.750
And Jesus later repeated them at Matthew chapter 22 verses 37 through 40.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.219
He said to him,

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:17.219
you must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:20.219
This is the greatest and first commandment.

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:25.219
The second, like it is this, you must love your neighbor as yourself.

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:32.219
On these two commandments, the whole law hangs and the prophets.

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:39.219
So our use of free will has love of God and love of neighbor as its boundaries.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:43.219
I mean, notice, for example, what people are doing in this picture,

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:49.219
both inside the circle, boundary, and outside.

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:53.219
See, free will allows us to do any of the things we see in the picture.

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:58.219
But love of God and love of neighbor move us to reject what's outside the circle

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:03.219
and choose to do the kinds of things that we see inside the circle.

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:05.219
Now, to stay within those boundaries,

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:10.219
Jehovah gave us a marvelous brain and a built-in conscience.

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:12.219
But he also knows we need more help.

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:18.220
And that's why he also gave us Bible principles, basic truths from the Bible

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.220
that can help us to make good decisions.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.220
And it can safely be said that any decision we face can be guided by Bible principles.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.220
Now, our creator, Jehovah, knows what's best for us.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.220
And he also trusts us to make decisions based on Bible principles.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.220
Because he knows that when we do that,

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.220
then we're really truly going to be happy, content,

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.220
and at peace with him and with others.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.220
So in review so far, Jehovah gave us free will.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.220
That's the privilege to make choices for ourselves.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:02.220
And he also gave us Bible principles as the boundaries to our choices.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.220
But making difficult decisions requires that we train ourselves

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.220
to recognize Bible principles and apply them.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.220
Now, let's read Romans chapter 12 and verse 1.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:23.220
And let's see how this verse describes the decision making a process.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.220
Therefore, I appeal to you by the compassion of God brothers

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.220
to present your bodies as a living sacrifice,

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:39.220
holy and acceptable to God, a sacred service with your power of reason.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:46.220
So, are we using our power of reason to understand Bible principles?

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.220
For example, young children ask lots of questions.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.220
But as a child ever asked you, what happens when I drop a ball?

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.220
A pencil? A book? No, they don't ask that.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:04.220
They know what happens to anything they drop. It falls down.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.220
See, the child doesn't need rules for every object

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.220
but has quickly grasped the principle.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.220
Anything he drops falls down.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.220
Now, what if an 18-year-old asks you,

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.220
what's going to happen when I drop this pen?

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:27.220
Well, it's obvious he's not been paying attention to basic principles of life.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.220
So by us paying attention to Bible principles,

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:37.220
we can very quickly see the pattern of love of God and love of neighbor.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:43.220
And know the right thing to do without a long list of rules for every situation.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:48.600
Well, how can we train our power of reason?

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:54.600
We train it by paying attention as we read and study the Bible.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.600
Now, we don't need rules for which movies to watch,

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.600
which songs to listen to, or what clothes we can wear.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.600
If we're paying attention when we're reading the Bible,

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.600
we train our conscience with Bible principles

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.600
so we can make such decisions without needing a long list of rules.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.600
You know, we could compare our training our power of reason

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.600
to a blind person using a guide dog.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.600
Now, an untrained dog would be very helpful to a blind person.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.600
It would bark when others were around, for example.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:37.600
However, a dog trained in specific skills is amazingly helpful.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:44.600
The dog knows when to stop at curbs, walk around obstacles that the person right run their head into.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:50.600
A guide dog is also taught a skill called intelligent disobedience.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:55.600
And even if the blind person encourages the dog forward, it won't obey.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.600
But it'll pull the person back from danger.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.600
Now, it can take a year or more of training for the dog to learn the amazing skills

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.600
that are so helpful to a blind person.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:12.600
Likewise, our raw untrained power of reason can help us to a degree.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:18.600
However, it can be amazing if we take the time to train it.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.600
Now, here are three skills that we can use to train our power of reason.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:29.600
They are illustrating, analyzing, and balancing.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.850
Now, to consider our first skill illustrating,

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:39.850
let's use the general topic of forgiveness.

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:44.850
What Bible principles could help with forgiveness?

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:50.159
Please think of as many principles and scriptures as you can.

00:08:50.159 --> 00:08:56.159
Now, if it helps, you can pause the program now and write down the principles that come to mind.

00:08:56.159 --> 00:09:01.789
Now, your list may include principles like these.

00:09:01.789 --> 00:09:07.789
Matthew 18, 22, says, to forgive up to 77 times.

00:09:07.789 --> 00:09:13.789
Proverbs 12, 18 says, the tongue of the wise is a healing.

00:09:13.789 --> 00:09:20.789
And Colossians 3, verse 13 tells us, to forgive one another freely.

00:09:20.789 --> 00:09:26.789
Now, the skill we want to learn is illustrating, creating a mental picture of an idea

00:09:26.789 --> 00:09:29.789
or principle to see its real meaning and impact.

00:09:29.789 --> 00:09:36.789
Now, even if we are not skilled artists, all of us can and do create pictures in our minds.

00:09:36.789 --> 00:09:44.789
When illustrating, pay attention to things that are similar or like the thing you're trying to visualize.

00:09:44.789 --> 00:09:53.789
For example, if sin is like dead, then forgiveness is like someone cancelling the dead.

00:09:53.789 --> 00:10:01.789
If a hurtful remark is like a cut, then forgiveness is like seeing it heal.

00:10:01.789 --> 00:10:08.789
If sin is like a mark on a blackboard, forgiveness is like erasing it.

00:10:08.789 --> 00:10:17.710
A Proverbs 12 and verse 18 is a great example of using the like technique.

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:25.710
Thoughtless speech is like the stabs of a sword, but the tongue of the wise is a healing.

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:33.710
Imagine what your skin would look like if you still had every open cut, bruise or bleeding scratch since childhood.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:38.710
See, Jehovah wonderfully designed our body to heal such minor cuts and bruises.

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:45.710
And we can now visualize how the forgiveness of others helps us to heal emotionally.

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:49.710
Now, learning to illustrate or visualize takes time and practice.

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:55.710
However, it can be one of the most powerful skills we use to train our power of reason.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.710
And it can also be quite enjoyable.

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:06.710
Try at your family worship to take the principles for a topic and see how many similarities or likes you can come up with.

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:16.710
Now, granted, they all won't be amazing, but you may be surprised by the insights that come from seeing something from a new perspective.

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:21.710
Well, let's consider now our second skill, analyzing.

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:26.710
Now, analyzing something means examining it carefully in detail.

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:30.710
And let's use the topic of wrong desires.

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:38.710
Now, in this case, let's say we've already found the principle at Colossians chapter 3 and verse 5.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:55.179
Deadened, therefore, your body members that are on the earth as respect sexual immorality, uncleanness, uncontrolled sexual passion, hurtful desire and greediness, which is idolatry.

00:11:55.179 --> 00:12:03.179
Now, what can we learn from analyzing Colossians chapter 3 and verse 5 to help when we struggle with wrong desires?

00:12:03.179 --> 00:12:09.779
Again, feel free to pause the program if you want some time to think about it.

00:12:09.779 --> 00:12:12.779
Look carefully at each step outlined.

00:12:12.779 --> 00:12:20.779
Did you notice, for example, what appears to be a reverse order of the steps leading to sin?

00:12:21.779 --> 00:12:27.779
This verse works its way from sexual immorality back to the very roots of the problem.

00:12:27.779 --> 00:12:35.779
Now, let's take each phrase starting with the last, greediness, which is idolatry.

00:12:35.779 --> 00:12:42.779
So sexual immorality starts with selfishness, greedily putting our needs ahead of anything else.

00:12:42.779 --> 00:12:45.779
Next is hurtful desire.

00:12:45.779 --> 00:12:48.779
Greediness leads to hurtful desire.

00:12:48.779 --> 00:12:56.779
It's like a person hanging around a bakery, smelling the bread and cakes when he can't pay for it.

00:12:56.779 --> 00:13:06.779
Likewise, hanging around immoral entertainment or bad associates can feed hurtful desire for what is not ours.

00:13:06.779 --> 00:13:10.779
Next is listed uncontrolled sexual passion.

00:13:10.779 --> 00:13:22.779
So hurtful desire has now turned from an idea into a strong emotion of passion, causing one to look for an opportunity to fulfill the desire.

00:13:22.779 --> 00:13:25.779
Next, uncleanness.

00:13:25.779 --> 00:13:31.779
The previous steps have now led to inappropriate physical contact with another person.

00:13:31.779 --> 00:13:37.350
Finally, sexual immorality. Serious sin.

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:43.350
Sexual immoralities occurred between persons that are not married to one another.

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:52.350
So analyzing Colossians chapter 3 and verse 5 can really help us to eliminate not stimulate wrong desires.

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:57.350
And we can see how important it is to get rid of wrong desires immediately.

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:03.350
It's easier to walk away from sin when we're still in the early stages rather than later.

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:12.350
So we need to practice a skill of not simply just reading scriptures, but analyzing them until we've learned all that we can.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:18.350
And we can use the many research tools we have to find valuable comments and application.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:24.350
Now let's consider our third and final skill balancing.

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:29.350
And to do that, let's use a question on the topic of alcohol.

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:37.350
What Bible principles could help a couple to decide whether to serve alcohol at their wedding?

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:44.350
What principles and scriptures do you think would help them make a balanced decision?

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:50.350
Again, you're welcome to pause the program and if you'd like to write down what comes to mind or to research something.

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:55.889
Now, your list probably has some of these principles.

00:14:55.889 --> 00:15:00.889
At John chapter 2 and verse 9, Jesus made wine for a wedding.

00:15:00.889 --> 00:15:07.889
However, 1 Corinthians chapter 6 and verse 10 says that drunkards will not inherit the kingdom.

00:15:07.889 --> 00:15:21.889
And 1 Corinthians 10, 31 and 32 says, whether you're eating or drinking, do all things for God's glory, and to keep from becoming causes for stumbling.

00:15:21.889 --> 00:15:26.889
Now, it doesn't seem that any one principle provides the answer.

00:15:26.889 --> 00:15:32.889
The couple could simply say, well, Jesus served wine at a wedding, so can we do?

00:15:32.889 --> 00:15:35.889
However, there's really more to it than that, isn't there?

00:15:35.889 --> 00:15:41.889
It's clear that a balance of all these Bible principles is needed.

00:15:41.889 --> 00:15:46.889
Will relatives or others be there who might be prone to over drinking?

00:15:46.889 --> 00:15:53.889
Serving alcohol bother the conscience of many present because of local customs and feelings about alcohol.

00:15:53.889 --> 00:16:05.889
It's often the case when making decisions that we need to balance several Bible principles not taking any one principle solely on its own merit.

00:16:05.889 --> 00:16:13.889
Jehovah expects us to use our power of reason to balance Bible principles and make good decisions.

00:16:13.889 --> 00:16:21.889
Ecclesiastes chapter 7 and verses 16 through 18 gives us good advice about being balanced.

00:16:21.889 --> 00:16:29.889
Do not be overly righteous nor show yourself excessively wise. Why should you bring ruin to yourself?

00:16:29.889 --> 00:16:35.889
Do not be excessively wicked nor be foolish. Why should you die before your time?

00:16:35.889 --> 00:16:40.889
It is best to grasp one warning without letting go of the other,

00:16:40.889 --> 00:16:44.889
where the one who fears God will heed them both.

00:16:44.889 --> 00:16:51.889
How true. Such balance between extremes is often necessary when we apply Bible principles.

00:16:51.889 --> 00:16:54.889
We need to heed them both, so to speak.

00:16:54.889 --> 00:17:03.889
We need to balance all the Bible principles so we can come to the decision that would show love of God and love of neighbor.

00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:10.890
We could illustrate the balance between different Bible principles and applying them with this modeled bike.

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:12.890
It was a gift from a brother in Malawi.

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:20.890
Now, a bicycle has three basic principles of operation, the brakes, the pedals, and the steering.

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:27.890
Now, the brakes are really like principles that slow us down or stop us from doing the wrong thing.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:35.890
And the pedals are really like the principles that move us forward in showing love for Jehovah and our brothers and sisters.

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:42.890
And the steering is like our free will to choose a direction in life that pleases Jehovah.

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:51.890
So making decisions is like riding a bicycle. We have to balance several Bible principles.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:18:02.890
So in review, Jehovah gave us free will to use within the boundaries of love of God and love of neighbor and many other fine Bible principles.

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:09.890
Making difficult decisions requires that we train our power of reason to recognize Bible principles and apply them.

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:17.890
And we discussed how to train our power of reason with the three skills illustrating, analyzing, and balancing.

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:27.359
So no matter what decisions you're faced with, we encourage you, let Bible principles guide you.

00:18:27.359 --> 00:18:32.359
Let's use the following dramatization to practice the skills we've just discussed.

00:18:32.359 --> 00:18:38.359
In this video, three witnesses all hear the same familiar Bible counsel at a Christian meeting.

00:18:38.359 --> 00:18:45.359
And at first, it doesn't seem to apply to anything they're currently experiencing, but it does.

00:18:45.359 --> 00:18:47.359
Maybe that's happened to you.

00:18:48.359 --> 00:19:01.049
As you listen to their reasoning, what do you think they could do to let Bible principles guide them to making a good decision?

00:19:01.049 --> 00:19:13.049
We must know Jehovah well. That means knowing his thinking on matters. We should welcome such an examination and make any necessary changes.

00:19:13.049 --> 00:19:18.049
For example, let's read 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and verse 33 together.

00:19:18.049 --> 00:19:21.710
Here we read,

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:27.710
Do not be misled. Bad associations spoil useful habits.

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:35.710
As familiar as that principle is, can you think of an area in your life where it's difficult to apply?

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:44.299
Hey, John. I know it's not unusual, but there's no one entertained those clients tonight. So can you do it? Thanks.

00:19:49.589 --> 00:20:05.829
Till then, it wasn't my usual thing, but I need to support my family.

00:20:05.829 --> 00:20:20.049
And these aren't really my friends. I can handle it.

00:20:20.049 --> 00:20:25.049
I think we're faced with bad associations in subtle ways.

00:20:25.049 --> 00:20:30.049
This may require us to ask additional questions of ourselves.

00:20:30.049 --> 00:20:35.049
Are we letting in bad association through social media?

00:20:35.049 --> 00:20:38.049
Perhaps we can think of another way, Madison.

00:20:38.049 --> 00:20:47.829
I don't think so, except for some friends for my old congregation.

00:20:47.829 --> 00:20:51.829
Wow, they're not doing so well spiritually.

00:20:51.829 --> 00:20:58.829
But if I stay connected and see what they're doing, maybe I can help them.

00:20:58.829 --> 00:21:00.829
This can affect us.

00:21:00.829 --> 00:21:04.829
Maybe it's something very specific.

00:21:04.829 --> 00:21:15.309
Or maybe bad association is coming from a place we never expected.

00:21:15.309 --> 00:21:19.309
I only join games with witness friends, I know.

00:21:19.309 --> 00:21:26.309
But sometimes they connect with people I don't know.

00:21:26.309 --> 00:21:30.309
Who pick games? I'm not sure we should play.

00:21:30.309 --> 00:21:39.269
But maybe my friends know them.

00:21:39.269 --> 00:21:41.269
They're probably okay.

00:21:41.269 --> 00:21:45.269
Vital that we avoid bad associations.

00:21:45.269 --> 00:21:49.269
Now, as we resume in Psalm 26...

00:21:49.269 --> 00:21:53.269
The basic principle in this story is one we all know.

00:21:53.269 --> 00:21:56.269
Bad associations spoil useful habits.

00:21:56.269 --> 00:22:00.269
But do our three friends find themselves in the same situation

00:22:00.269 --> 00:22:06.269
where they can simply apply 1 Corinthians 15, 33 in exactly the same way?

00:22:06.269 --> 00:22:08.269
No.

00:22:08.269 --> 00:22:12.269
Our family head is concerned about supporting his family.

00:22:12.269 --> 00:22:17.269
Our sister wants to stay in touch with her friends in hopes of helping them spiritually.

00:22:17.269 --> 00:22:22.269
And our young brother didn't know exactly who his associates were.

00:22:22.269 --> 00:22:25.269
Are you already thinking of additional principles

00:22:25.269 --> 00:22:28.269
that would apply to each person's problem?

00:22:28.269 --> 00:22:32.269
How would you illustrate, analyze, or balance those principles

00:22:32.269 --> 00:22:34.269
if you were in their position?

00:22:34.269 --> 00:22:37.269
If you want to, pause the program here.

00:22:37.269 --> 00:22:40.269
Take the time to write down what you're thinking.

00:22:40.269 --> 00:22:44.269
Then watch how they each search for Bible principles

00:22:44.269 --> 00:22:47.269
and train their power of reason.

00:22:47.269 --> 00:22:52.220
I thought that talk didn't apply to me.

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:56.220
But can I really handle bad association?

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:59.220
If I take a stand, I may lose my job.

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:09.779
But that's being anxious about tomorrow.

00:23:09.779 --> 00:23:12.779
Jesus said, so never be anxious.

00:23:12.779 --> 00:23:14.779
And say, what are we to eat?

00:23:14.779 --> 00:23:18.779
Or what are we to drink? Or what are we to wear?

00:23:18.779 --> 00:23:21.779
Jehovah knows I need a job.

00:23:21.779 --> 00:23:29.779
And I need to set a good example for when my children face bad association.

00:23:29.779 --> 00:23:38.220
1 Corinthians 15, 33.

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:41.220
My friends' posts are getting worse.

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:45.220
They're pictures and comments.

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:51.049
2 Timothy 216.

00:23:51.049 --> 00:23:56.049
But reject empty speeches that violate what is holy.

00:23:56.049 --> 00:24:01.049
For they will lead to more and more ungodliness.

00:24:01.049 --> 00:24:06.779
I'm letting them share empty speeches with me online.

00:24:06.779 --> 00:24:09.779
I will try to help them while I still can.

00:24:09.779 --> 00:24:16.660
But following their posts is not the way to do it.

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:20.660
I told Mom what's been happening when I came with my friends.

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:26.380
She gave me good ideas on what to look for in the research guide.

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:28.380
Christian life.

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:30.380
Association.

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:34.980
Is your recreation beneficial?

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:39.650
Who are my companions?

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:43.650
It says, who are the ones I want to share my leisure time with?

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:50.220
Does he have the same Bible-based values and morals that I have?

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:52.220
Good question.

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:55.220
I don't even know who they are sometimes.

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:59.220
Psalm 11963 says,

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:02.220
I am a friend of all who fear you,

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:06.750
and of those who keep your orders.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:09.750
But if I only know them online,

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:15.740
I can't know if they fear Jehovah.

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:19.740
Let's turn in our Bibles to the book of 1 Timothy chapter 1.

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.740
Verse number 5.

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:23.740
And notice how it reads.

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:28.500
Really, the objective of this instruction

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:33.500
is love out of a clean heart and out of a good conscience

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:37.500
and out of faith without hypocrisy.

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.500
We train our conscience

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:45.500
with Bible principles that reveal Jehovah's thinking.

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:50.500
There may be several principles needed for our unique problem.

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.500
But when we find and apply them,

00:25:53.500 --> 00:26:04.220
we'll enjoy a clean heart and a good conscience.

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:07.220
How did their Bible principles and meditation compare

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:09.220
to what you were thinking?

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:12.220
Now, you may not have come up with the same scriptures and thoughts,

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:14.220
but that's okay.

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:18.220
The important thing is that by training our power of reason,

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:22.220
we're aligning our thoughts with Jehovah's thoughts.

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:25.220
Did you see the three skills in use?

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:29.220
The young brother was able to visualize his potential friends.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.220
He couldn't see them literally,

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:34.220
but knowing they didn't fear Jehovah

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.220
or keep his orders,

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:40.220
painted a picture of the kind of associates they might prove to be.

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:44.220
When our sister analyzed 2 Timothy chapter 2 and verse 16,

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.220
she saw the social media comments

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:52.220
were similar to empty speeches that could weaken her faith.

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:57.220
And the family had balanced his family responsibilities

00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:01.220
by applying the principle at Matthew chapter 6, verse 31,

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:05.220
where Jesus said not to be anxious over material things.

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:09.220
And we can imagine him trying to work the matter out with his boss

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:12.220
while trusting Jehovah to care for him and his family

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:15.220
no matter what might happen to his job.

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:19.220
Think now about another principle in Matthew chapter 6.

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:25.220
Jesus tells us in verse 33 to seek first the kingdom.

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:28.220
Young ones especially face temptations,

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.220
both large and small,

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:32.220
to seek things in the world instead.

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:37.220
And sadly, some have ignored Bible principles they have learned.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:39.220
They've looked for happiness in what appears

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:43.220
to be the exciting possibilities of the system of things.

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:46.220
In this truth transforms life's segment,

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:50.220
Sister Annalise Zalina explains what led her to a similar choice

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:53.220
and what drew her back to Jehovah.

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:59.539
Growing up in the truth,

00:27:59.539 --> 00:28:04.539
I felt like I fit in more with my friends at school

00:28:04.539 --> 00:28:06.539
or people who weren't witnesses.

00:28:06.539 --> 00:28:09.539
I was living a double life and I knew it.

00:28:09.539 --> 00:28:11.539
I was not baptized.

00:28:11.539 --> 00:28:15.539
I had always tried to make the truth fit in with the world.

00:28:15.539 --> 00:28:18.539
And this time I decided I just want to give the world a shot

00:28:18.539 --> 00:28:19.539
and see what that's like.

00:28:19.539 --> 00:28:22.539
I came right to my parents and I said I want to move to LA

00:28:22.539 --> 00:28:24.539
and pursue modeling.

00:28:24.539 --> 00:28:27.539
I had my first job within the week.

00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:30.539
It looked so glamorous.

00:28:30.539 --> 00:28:43.950
There's a lot of parties going to the coolest houses,

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:46.950
getting to hang out with celebrities.

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:49.950
There are new rules.

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:53.950
You have the money to do whatever you want.

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:58.950
That lifestyle was so far from what I was raised knowing I was right.

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:03.950
That I basically had no relationship with Jehovah.

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:05.950
Once all the smoke and mirrors are gone,

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:07.950
you see these things for what they are.

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:11.950
I remember I called my mom and I told her it's like Sodom and Gomorrah.

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:13.950
I'm literally in the middle of it all.

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:15.950
And I thought like this is it.

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:17.950
This is what everyone says is the best.

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:21.950
And I'm not happy and I just thought so dull, empty.

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:25.950
And I actually thought to myself, I wish I was never raised to witness.

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:28.950
I wish I never even knew Jehovah existed.

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:32.950
There were certain nights where I needed him.

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:34.950
I was thinking just pray, just go to him.

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:35.950
And I couldn't.

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:45.900
I thought I would never be able to come back to Jehovah.

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:49.900
One of the jobs I got hired to do was work for this young fashion company

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:52.900
in between different outfits and shoots.

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:57.339
You know, you talk with a photographer.

00:29:57.339 --> 00:29:59.339
So what are you guys going to be for Halloween?

00:29:59.339 --> 00:30:01.339
That doesn't celebrate Halloween.

00:30:01.339 --> 00:30:03.339
It's not a Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:30:03.339 --> 00:30:05.339
So am I.

00:30:05.339 --> 00:30:06.339
It's not a joke.

00:30:06.339 --> 00:30:09.339
No, I was raised as witness.

00:30:09.339 --> 00:30:11.339
Yeah, I was raised as well.

00:30:11.339 --> 00:30:13.339
Do you go to meetings?

00:30:13.339 --> 00:30:15.339
No, I haven't been in forever.

00:30:15.339 --> 00:30:16.339
What about you?

00:30:16.339 --> 00:30:18.339
No, I haven't.

00:30:18.339 --> 00:30:21.339
I got a last minute job to New York.

00:30:21.339 --> 00:30:24.339
I decided to walk the Brooklyn Bridge.

00:30:24.339 --> 00:30:27.339
I knew Bethel was there and I'd never been to Bethel.

00:30:27.339 --> 00:30:32.339
The sister stopped me on my tour and she invited me up to her office.

00:30:32.339 --> 00:30:35.339
There were different paintings of the resurrection.

00:30:35.339 --> 00:30:38.339
She asked me, you know what, the people are waiting on the balcony.

00:30:38.339 --> 00:30:41.339
And I was like, I don't know why.

00:30:41.339 --> 00:30:45.339
And she said, because they're waiting for their loved ones to be resurrected.

00:30:45.339 --> 00:30:51.089
It was as if something just went straight to my heart.

00:30:51.089 --> 00:30:53.089
I've never felt something like that.

00:30:53.089 --> 00:30:58.089
I had for the first time actually seen the resurrection and believed it.

00:30:58.089 --> 00:31:00.089
It wasn't just the saying that might happen.

00:31:00.089 --> 00:31:01.089
It was for sure.

00:31:01.089 --> 00:31:03.089
I knew exactly what it was going to look like.

00:31:03.089 --> 00:31:09.089
I would be standing there pulling that balcony looking for my loved ones to come back.

00:31:09.089 --> 00:31:13.230
I had to be there.

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:15.230
The resurrection.

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:17.230
It's so real to me.

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:24.230
The second I got out of Bethel, I, I called my mom and I told her in slays and mom.

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:27.660
I'll be back.

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:30.660
I know exactly what I need to do.

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:32.660
I'm coming back to Jehovah.

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:38.490
I had made up my mind, you know, I'm going to give Jehovah a chance.

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:40.490
But, you know, I'm coming back to truth.

00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:42.490
I'm going to do it right.

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:45.490
There was an elder who was doing the watchtower.

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:50.490
And he just came off so kind that I thought, you know, when this meeting ends, I want to talk with him.

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:52.490
And I'm going to explain to him why I'm here.

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:55.490
I knew I had so many changes to make.

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:58.490
Matthew 6, 33, is so important to me.

00:31:58.490 --> 00:32:01.490
Seek first the kingdom.

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:03.490
My entire life.

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:05.490
I saw everything I was before Jehovah.

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:07.490
I never put him first.

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:10.490
And I, for the first time, was saying, okay, Jehovah.

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:12.490
I'm going to put you first.

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:16.490
The job I have right now isn't necessarily my dream job.

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:19.490
But it allows me to do exactly what I want to do for Jehovah.

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:21.490
And that's fine here.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:26.490
I used to walk down Hollywood Boulevard going from casting to casting with my portfolio in hand.

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:30.490
And now I walk down Hollywood Boulevard with a cup in my hand.

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:33.490
Out in the ministry, I see models that I used to work with.

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:36.490
And I love getting to show them this is my new life.

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:38.490
And this has changed my life.

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:39.490
I am so happy.

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:42.490
I know what it's like to superficially feel good.

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:52.559
But to literally have the joy, the happiness, I want to share that with everybody.

00:32:52.559 --> 00:33:10.019
Jehovah completely changed my life.

00:33:10.019 --> 00:33:15.019
We're so happy that Sister Zelina returned and dedicated her life to Jehovah.

00:33:15.019 --> 00:33:19.019
Even though she wanted to forget what she knew about God,

00:33:19.019 --> 00:33:23.019
the things she had learned about him kept coming back to her mind.

00:33:23.019 --> 00:33:27.019
Finally, when she saw the picture of the resurrection while touring Bethel,

00:33:27.019 --> 00:33:30.019
it was a powerful reminder of Jehovah's love.

00:33:30.019 --> 00:33:36.019
Really, Sister Zelina's Bible-trained conscience was at work the entire time.

00:33:36.019 --> 00:33:43.019
Young ones, please know that Jehovah does not want to hold you back from having fun.

00:33:43.019 --> 00:33:50.019
And he doesn't want you to feel guilty for the desire to use your talents and to enjoy life.

00:33:50.019 --> 00:33:54.019
But he does want to protect you from spiritual dangers.

00:33:54.019 --> 00:33:59.019
And he asks you to seek first the kingdom in these last days.

00:33:59.019 --> 00:34:03.019
Proverbs 10 and verse 22 puts it well.

00:34:03.019 --> 00:34:07.019
It is the blessing of Jehovah that makes one rich,

00:34:07.019 --> 00:34:11.019
and he adds no pain with it.

00:34:11.019 --> 00:34:15.019
It is Satan's system that adds any pain we may experience.

00:34:15.019 --> 00:34:20.019
Sister Zelina and so many others have found that scripture to be true.

00:34:20.019 --> 00:34:24.019
So often, young ones who choose to give Jehovah their best

00:34:24.019 --> 00:34:30.019
are blessed with ways to use their talents and interests in sacred service.

00:34:30.019 --> 00:34:36.019
Jehovah wants you to be part of the exciting fulfillment of Micah chapter 4 and verse 2,

00:34:36.019 --> 00:34:41.019
where nations are saying, come, let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah.

00:34:41.019 --> 00:34:49.019
Well, that verse was the daily text and part of a morning worship discussion by Brother Jeffrey Jackson.

00:34:49.019 --> 00:34:52.019
Micah's prophecy is being fulfilled now,

00:34:52.019 --> 00:35:00.019
and it results in our worldwide Brotherhood and highlights the need for Christian unity and neutrality.

00:35:00.019 --> 00:35:03.019
So, Brother Jackson asked an interesting question.

00:35:03.019 --> 00:35:08.019
How important is our neutrality?

00:35:08.019 --> 00:35:12.019
It's true, isn't it? When we look at this prophecy in the book of Micah,

00:35:12.019 --> 00:35:19.019
it's very exciting because it portrays to us what's actually happening among God's people today.

00:35:19.019 --> 00:35:26.019
We know that, although in the new world, there will be a tremendous unity displayed by God's people,

00:35:26.019 --> 00:35:33.019
chapter 4 of Micah is actually portraying what's happening now, and we're involved with this.

00:35:33.019 --> 00:35:38.019
And we know that because in verse 5 says at the same time that this unity would be evident,

00:35:38.019 --> 00:35:42.019
all the peoples will walk each in the name of its God.

00:35:42.019 --> 00:35:48.019
Well, that's not talking about the new world, is it? It's talking about the time we're living in now.

00:35:48.019 --> 00:35:54.019
But what is it that helps all of Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide to be so united

00:35:54.019 --> 00:35:59.019
and not to be involved with the wars of this world?

00:35:59.019 --> 00:36:03.019
Well, one of the things that helps us is our Christian neutrality.

00:36:03.019 --> 00:36:06.019
What do we mean by neutrality?

00:36:06.019 --> 00:36:10.019
We mean not taking sides in political issues.

00:36:10.019 --> 00:36:13.019
Of course, we take sides with Jehovah and the Kingdom,

00:36:13.019 --> 00:36:21.019
but with regard to worldly political debates and issues that rise, we don't take sides.

00:36:21.019 --> 00:36:23.019
Why is this so important?

00:36:23.019 --> 00:36:33.019
Well, let's turn our Bibles to Revelation chapter 13, Revelation 13 verses 16 and 17.

00:36:33.019 --> 00:36:38.019
And here it tells us, it puts under compulsion all people,

00:36:38.019 --> 00:36:42.019
the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves,

00:36:42.019 --> 00:36:47.019
that these should be marked on their right hand and on their forehead,

00:36:47.019 --> 00:36:52.019
and that nobody can buy or sell except a person having the mark,

00:36:52.019 --> 00:36:58.019
the name of the wild beast of the number of its name or the number of its name.

00:36:58.019 --> 00:37:01.019
What's the point of this verse?

00:37:01.019 --> 00:37:06.019
Well, of course, we will look forward to seeing how this may turn out in the future

00:37:06.019 --> 00:37:10.019
and what pressure is put on God's people at that time.

00:37:10.019 --> 00:37:17.019
But even now we see the principle here that the political system is wanting to put its mark on us,

00:37:17.019 --> 00:37:20.019
mentally as well as physically.

00:37:20.019 --> 00:37:24.019
So we see the forehead as well as the hand being involved.

00:37:24.019 --> 00:37:32.019
So we need to be absolutely certain that we remain neutral with regard to political issues in the world,

00:37:32.019 --> 00:37:39.019
not only by not being involved actively in the political issues, but also mentally,

00:37:39.019 --> 00:37:43.019
not allowing ourselves to take sides.

00:37:43.019 --> 00:37:47.019
What are some of the things that perhaps could erode our neutrality?

00:37:47.019 --> 00:37:51.019
Well, maybe we could mention three things this morning.

00:37:51.019 --> 00:37:56.019
One is the propaganda that the world puts forward.

00:37:56.019 --> 00:38:00.019
And we have seen what the media says about Jehovah's Witnesses' Heaven.

00:38:00.019 --> 00:38:07.019
We have distorted some of their reports and how they can paint a negative picture with regard to us.

00:38:07.019 --> 00:38:14.019
Well, should we expect that they are neutral with regard to other events that they report on,

00:38:14.019 --> 00:38:17.019
particularly when there are conflicts between two nations.

00:38:17.019 --> 00:38:23.019
The media in one particular nation may promote certain ideas about the other nation.

00:38:23.019 --> 00:38:26.019
We may be affected by that.

00:38:26.019 --> 00:38:32.019
We may be surprised perhaps to visit some other countries that have a different political ideology

00:38:32.019 --> 00:38:37.019
and be surprised to see how things perhaps were a little different in that country

00:38:37.019 --> 00:38:40.019
to how it's portrayed by the media in our country.

00:38:40.019 --> 00:38:45.019
So we need to be careful not to be influenced by the propaganda of this world,

00:38:45.019 --> 00:38:49.019
particularly media reports and so on.

00:38:49.019 --> 00:38:54.019
What's another thing perhaps that could cause us to lose a measure of neutrality?

00:38:54.019 --> 00:38:56.019
Sporting events.

00:38:56.019 --> 00:39:02.019
Sometimes sporting events were able to achieve certain goals with regard to nationalism.

00:39:02.019 --> 00:39:06.019
We see the national anthem being played many of these events.

00:39:06.019 --> 00:39:10.019
It reminds me many years ago when I was in a different country.

00:39:10.019 --> 00:39:14.019
A friend of mine asked me to record a certain sporting event.

00:39:14.019 --> 00:39:19.019
I wasn't particularly interested in the event, but because he made this request, I recorded it.

00:39:20.019 --> 00:39:24.019
And of course, I wanted to make sure that I'd got the last 10 minutes of it.

00:39:24.019 --> 00:39:29.019
I thought a friendship may be strained if I didn't get the actual last part of the game.

00:39:29.019 --> 00:39:35.019
But I watched it. It was absolutely exciting, now biting finish.

00:39:35.019 --> 00:39:41.019
Well, after the brother gave me back the video tape, I thought maybe some of the other brothers

00:39:41.019 --> 00:39:46.019
who would be interested in this sporting event may want to have it rather than just wipe the tape.

00:39:47.019 --> 00:39:49.019
So I offered it to several.

00:39:49.019 --> 00:39:52.019
And each one of them said to me, no, thanks.

00:39:52.019 --> 00:39:55.019
If we had one, perhaps it would be different.

00:39:55.019 --> 00:39:57.019
Now, what was the problem?

00:39:57.019 --> 00:40:00.019
As I said to them, were you watching the game?

00:40:00.019 --> 00:40:02.019
Or were you taking sides?

00:40:02.019 --> 00:40:06.019
An interesting concept, because here two different nations were involved.

00:40:06.019 --> 00:40:12.019
So we have to be careful that even sporting events don't stir up within us

00:40:12.019 --> 00:40:15.019
in certain nationalistic feelings.

00:40:15.019 --> 00:40:20.019
And perhaps we could take sides with regard to certain events.

00:40:20.019 --> 00:40:25.019
The third area that perhaps could erode our neutrality,

00:40:25.019 --> 00:40:30.019
the political promises being made, particularly the election time.

00:40:30.019 --> 00:40:35.019
Perhaps one of the candidates is from our ethnic background.

00:40:35.019 --> 00:40:39.019
Or perhaps it's the same gender as we are.

00:40:39.019 --> 00:40:43.019
When we look at the political situation, these days with many elections,

00:40:43.019 --> 00:40:51.019
it seems to be more in the form of entertainment than anything else with music and very colorful characters.

00:40:51.019 --> 00:40:57.019
But if we were to say in our heart, I hope that idiot doesn't get into power.

00:40:57.019 --> 00:41:00.019
Are we neutral?

00:41:00.019 --> 00:41:04.019
Or were still, if we say, I hope the other person gets into power?

00:41:04.019 --> 00:41:07.019
Well, we need to be careful, don't we?

00:41:07.019 --> 00:41:11.019
I remember many years ago as a young pioneer in Australia,

00:41:11.019 --> 00:41:16.019
I was facing the conscription issue, the national call-up for the military,

00:41:16.019 --> 00:41:19.019
at that time the Vietnam War was being fought.

00:41:19.019 --> 00:41:22.019
And then there was an election in Australia.

00:41:22.019 --> 00:41:28.019
And at that time, the party that was trying to get into power said that if they got into power,

00:41:28.019 --> 00:41:30.019
they would abolish conscription.

00:41:30.019 --> 00:41:33.019
So now that affected me personally.

00:41:33.019 --> 00:41:37.019
I remember how hard it was sitting there watching the election results,

00:41:37.019 --> 00:41:41.019
not to say in my heart, I hope they get in.

00:41:41.019 --> 00:41:46.019
And then when they got in, not to say, yes.

00:41:46.019 --> 00:41:50.019
You see, if we personally are affected by some of these political promises,

00:41:50.019 --> 00:41:54.019
we may violate our neutrality.

00:41:54.019 --> 00:41:59.019
So brothers and sisters, let's work hard at remembering that we're no part of this world.

00:41:59.019 --> 00:42:04.019
We support the best government that could ever rule this earth.

00:42:04.019 --> 00:42:09.019
And by doing so, we will keep our neutrality and we will keep our unity.

00:42:09.019 --> 00:42:16.420
When neutrality is mentioned, isn't it true we often think of taking a stand during times of war?

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:24.420
But brother Jackson reminded us that neutrality is something we do every day in our thoughts and in our speech.

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:32.420
What a good example of analyzing a Bible principle to understand its full meaning and application for us.

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:39.420
Of course, there are times when governments do pressure God's people to renounce their faith or take up arms.

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:46.420
This happened to sister Gertrude Putzinger and her husband Martin in Nazi Germany during World War II.

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:50.420
Now later in life, brother Putzinger was a member of the governing body.

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:53.420
And he finished his earthly course in 1988.

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:58.420
Sister Putzinger continued faithful until her death in 2003.

00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:04.420
In an archived interview, sister Putzinger described her wartime experiences.

00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:12.420
How did Gertrude and Martin, like thousands of our spiritual brothers and sisters, keep their integrity through brutal persecution?

00:43:16.619 --> 00:43:20.619
I worked underground and travelled in Celetia.

00:43:20.619 --> 00:43:27.619
And at that time, I visited the family with copies of the watchtower.

00:43:27.619 --> 00:43:31.619
They catched me and arrested me in the rest.

00:43:31.619 --> 00:43:36.619
And there, there was the same strong interrogation.

00:43:36.619 --> 00:43:39.619
And Jehovah held me in a wonderful way.

00:43:39.619 --> 00:43:46.619
I was surprised by myself what kind of thoughts came in my mind.

00:43:46.619 --> 00:43:56.619
When they asked me, did you know that the organization of the watchtower is forbidden by the government?

00:43:56.619 --> 00:44:05.619
I was saying, sure, I noted, why you were working underground against our command?

00:44:05.619 --> 00:44:13.619
Then I was saying, the German judgment, they acknowledge the command.

00:44:13.619 --> 00:44:17.619
You have not to steal, not to lie, not to murder.

00:44:17.619 --> 00:44:21.619
And this came from the wasiah law, it's from the Bible.

00:44:21.619 --> 00:44:27.619
If you acknowledge this command, then you have to acknowledge the other command too.

00:44:27.619 --> 00:44:32.619
The Bible is saying, you have to watch to come together and to encourage one another.

00:44:33.619 --> 00:44:39.619
How can I do it if I would be ashamed to met them?

00:44:39.619 --> 00:44:41.619
I want to do the will of God.

00:44:41.619 --> 00:44:44.619
This is a command meant.

00:44:44.619 --> 00:44:47.619
The church was saying nothing. He spoke with it.

00:44:47.619 --> 00:44:50.619
Besides church, but he gave no answer.

00:44:50.619 --> 00:44:55.619
I was sentenced at first five years.

00:44:55.619 --> 00:44:59.619
And later on, they gave the go down to three and a half years.

00:44:59.619 --> 00:45:03.619
Because I was so young, I was 25 years of age.

00:45:03.619 --> 00:45:09.619
So I started my solitary confinement.

00:45:09.619 --> 00:45:16.619
But Jehovah's spirit made me a real joyful.

00:45:16.619 --> 00:45:26.619
Every day I was thinking, now I have to make every day a special object to think about.

00:45:27.619 --> 00:45:31.619
In fact, I want to think about the qualities of Jehovah.

00:45:31.619 --> 00:45:34.619
I start this with the more.

00:45:34.619 --> 00:45:40.619
So I put my finger in the ear and forth running to and fro and fro.

00:45:40.619 --> 00:45:43.619
I want nothing to hear outside.

00:45:43.619 --> 00:45:48.619
So wonderful thought and I was happy.

00:45:48.619 --> 00:45:54.619
Then when that was over, then I start what is hope.

00:45:54.619 --> 00:45:56.619
What is faith?

00:45:56.619 --> 00:46:00.619
I start to think about the fruits of spirit.

00:46:00.619 --> 00:46:02.619
You have a lot of.

00:46:02.619 --> 00:46:11.619
Then I have so much to think and the time runs after three and a half years.

00:46:11.619 --> 00:46:16.619
The Gestapo called me again and gave me declaration.

00:46:16.619 --> 00:46:22.619
I have to sign that I never want to be in connection with the Jehovah's Witnesses

00:46:22.619 --> 00:46:27.619
and that I refuse to learn more from the Bible.

00:46:27.619 --> 00:46:29.619
And I say, no, never.

00:46:29.619 --> 00:46:33.619
He said, you can think overnight.

00:46:33.619 --> 00:46:36.619
No, I want not to think overnight.

00:46:36.619 --> 00:46:40.619
And immediately I say, never, I will do it.

00:46:40.619 --> 00:46:42.619
Never, I will understand it.

00:46:42.619 --> 00:46:47.619
And then he was saying, then you have to take the consequences.

00:46:47.619 --> 00:46:53.940
You will come transferred to the concentration camp.

00:46:53.940 --> 00:47:00.940
And when I came and they ordered, I have to put all my breath out to give them away.

00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:10.940
And then I have to stay with other prisoners, several hours in a big bathroom.

00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:15.940
And we have to wait till the doctor will see us.

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:19.940
And then it was so humiliating.

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:24.940
They want to humiliate and they want to make a down.

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:30.940
And the old women between the young girls, they were so strong ashamed.

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:43.599
You saw it, how they suffered.

00:47:43.599 --> 00:47:45.599
I never will forget it.

00:47:45.599 --> 00:47:51.599
And after we get the new breath from the camp

00:47:51.599 --> 00:47:56.599
and they were trying to go to the panicked barrack.

00:47:56.599 --> 00:48:00.599
And then that was a terrible night.

00:48:00.599 --> 00:48:03.599
So many prisoners, they were crying tonight.

00:48:03.599 --> 00:48:11.599
And other women, women have to vomit.

00:48:11.599 --> 00:48:14.599
Although it was a terrible night.

00:48:14.599 --> 00:48:18.599
The next day we have to go for rocking.

00:48:18.599 --> 00:48:22.599
We had so strong to work from morning in summer time.

00:48:22.599 --> 00:48:25.599
From five o'clock we were on the roll, God bless.

00:48:25.599 --> 00:48:29.170
Till evening they have no luck.

00:48:29.170 --> 00:48:31.170
Then the quarantine came.

00:48:31.170 --> 00:48:33.170
We have no to go out.

00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:35.170
They closed the door.

00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:39.170
They give us our meal by a through the window.

00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:43.170
And we have fine time to have rest.

00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:47.170
We encourage one another with spiritual interest.

00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:51.170
And the doctor came knocked the window.

00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:53.170
Who died in your barrack?

00:48:53.170 --> 00:48:54.170
Nobody.

00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:56.170
No one.

00:48:56.170 --> 00:48:58.170
Our old weak sisters.

00:48:58.170 --> 00:49:00.170
They overcome all.

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:01.170
Never.

00:49:01.170 --> 00:49:04.170
Some were bekam sick.

00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:06.170
So it was real.

00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:09.170
A good witness for the other.

00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:11.170
In the camp.

00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:14.170
My husband was in the concentration camp.

00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:17.170
First in Dachau and later on in Mauthausen.

00:49:17.170 --> 00:49:20.170
They worked in a stone quarry.

00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:25.170
And in that group, a brother had to bat shoes.

00:49:25.170 --> 00:49:27.170
They were too tight for him.

00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:29.170
And he took them out.

00:49:29.170 --> 00:49:33.170
And he had forgotten to take them.

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:36.170
And for the don't worry to the camp.

00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:38.170
And my husband wanted to help him.

00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:41.170
And he was running to pick up the shoes.

00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:48.170
And the watchman observed that he ran away from the group.

00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:54.170
His punishment was to hang for one hour on the pale.

00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:57.170
When I asked my husband,

00:49:57.170 --> 00:50:01.170
how did you overcome such a thought?

00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:04.170
Then he said, I was thinking.

00:50:04.170 --> 00:50:10.170
How was the situation when Abraham had to kill his son?

00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:13.170
And this was a long way.

00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:15.170
I was all right thinking.

00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:17.170
What was his thoughts?

00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:20.170
How had he overcome his feeling?

00:50:20.170 --> 00:50:23.170
And what Jehovah wants for him?

00:50:23.170 --> 00:50:28.170
And then this way, he didn't feel anymore.

00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:32.170
After one hour, when it came down,

00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:34.170
the other brother was saying,

00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:39.170
you don't look as you have been on the target thing.

00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:45.170
So Jehovah can help us in all such situations.

00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:50.170
Every situation had some what was not so easy.

00:50:50.170 --> 00:50:53.170
But in every situation,

00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:56.170
we have a touch of wonderful help.

00:50:56.170 --> 00:51:00.170
Jehovah's spirit, and we could pray.

00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:04.170
Jehovah's name is the most important part in our life.

00:51:04.170 --> 00:51:08.170
Nothing is so important like Jehovah's name.

00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:13.340
Did you see the ways Jehovah blesses

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:18.340
Mr. Putzinger's determination to stay loyal under pressure?

00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:20.340
At Matthew 10 and verse 19,

00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:22.340
Jesus told his apostles,

00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:23.340
when they hand you over,

00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:28.340
do not become anxious about how or what you are to speak.

00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:32.340
For what you are to speak will be given you in that hour.

00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:34.340
Now she may have felt that same assurance

00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:37.340
when arrested and interrogated.

00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:39.340
Then when tested in the camps,

00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:42.340
they were not even meditated on Christian qualities

00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:45.340
and the faith of Bible characters.

00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:48.340
And finally, they, like so many witnesses,

00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:51.340
were helped to survive because of the love and care

00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:54.340
of their spiritual brothers and sisters.

00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:57.340
Sister Putzinger used her experience to encourage others

00:51:57.340 --> 00:51:59.340
in her later assignments.

00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:03.340
For example, in the interview with William and Sandra Malinfont,

00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:06.340
Sister Malinfont remembered working with Sister Putzinger

00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:08.340
in the Bethel-Sowing Department.

00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:11.340
After a memorable sewing illustration,

00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:15.340
she likened each prayer to adding another thread

00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:19.340
to a strong cord that unites us with Jehovah.

00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:21.340
You might enjoy watching that interview again

00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:24.340
in the interviews and experiences section

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:28.340
under blessings of Sacred Service.

00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:30.340
Later this month, you'll also want to watch

00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:34.340
a new original song under the music section.

00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:36.340
In the April 2016 program,

00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:39.340
a group of young ones explained why they visited Bethel

00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:41.340
and what they enjoyed seeing.

00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:45.340
While there, they also sang a song about their experience

00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:48.340
with the help of Bethelites at the branches they visited.

00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:55.119
And we have a music video to enjoy in this month's program.

00:52:55.119 --> 00:52:59.119
It's called Stop, Think, and Pray.

00:52:59.119 --> 00:53:03.119
No matter what the problem is, we should always take time

00:53:03.119 --> 00:53:06.119
to think about Bible principles and pray

00:53:06.119 --> 00:53:08.119
for Jehovah's Holy Spirit.

00:53:08.119 --> 00:53:24.210
I've been troubles around

00:53:24.210 --> 00:53:29.210
and the whole situation is guiding you down.

00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:34.210
So called friends, they just want a reaction.

00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:42.960
Turn to Jehovah and pray, silently pray.

00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:51.769
Don't give up, don't give in.

00:53:51.769 --> 00:53:56.769
Put your trust in Jehovah.

00:53:56.769 --> 00:54:07.130
Keep it calm if it stops and can pray.

00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:14.730
When there seems no way I'll be there.

00:54:14.730 --> 00:54:19.730
Always by our side, he will be our guide.

00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:22.730
Never doubt.

00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:27.730
Don't you stop and can pray.

00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:29.730
Make Jehovah smile.

00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:34.480
Let him show the way.

00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:51.250
He day will have troubles to share.

00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:53.250
There are bills to be paid.

00:54:53.250 --> 00:55:09.940
And so one smile.

00:55:09.940 --> 00:56:52.579
But I will solve the way.

00:56:52.579 --> 00:56:54.579
Jehovah will always bless us when we go to him

00:56:54.579 --> 00:56:56.579
and pray with our concerns.

00:56:56.579 --> 00:57:00.579
Whatever the situation, he can give us the power beyond

00:57:00.579 --> 00:57:01.579
what is normal.

00:57:01.579 --> 00:57:04.579
And as we learned and practiced in this program,

00:57:04.579 --> 00:57:07.579
we do our part by training our power of reason

00:57:07.579 --> 00:57:10.579
with the principles from his written word.

00:57:10.579 --> 00:57:15.579
Finally, we have greetings from the Vestoral and Islands in Norway.

00:57:15.579 --> 00:57:18.579
These islands are home to 30,000 people

00:57:18.579 --> 00:57:23.579
who enjoy the beautiful fjords, mountains and com beaches.

00:57:23.579 --> 00:57:27.579
The 53 publishers in the Surtland Norwegian congregation

00:57:27.579 --> 00:57:32.579
preach in a territory that covers 1,800 square kilometers

00:57:32.579 --> 00:57:37.579
or 695 square miles.

00:57:37.579 --> 00:57:41.579
Their thorough witnessing takes them into the beautiful countryside,

00:57:41.579 --> 00:57:46.579
as well as to the city of Surtland for metropolitan public witnessing.

00:57:46.579 --> 00:57:49.579
Each year, they organize trips to an assigned territory

00:57:49.579 --> 00:57:54.579
where they often meet people who show deep respect for the Bible.

00:57:54.579 --> 00:57:57.579
One Saturday each month, after the ministry,

00:57:57.579 --> 00:58:00.579
they gather to watch the JW Broadcasting program

00:58:00.579 --> 00:58:03.579
and enjoy spending time together.

00:58:03.579 --> 00:58:05.579
Progressive Bible studies and a Russian group

00:58:05.579 --> 00:58:08.579
join them each week at their meetings.

00:58:08.579 --> 00:58:10.579
We send our love and greetings

00:58:10.579 --> 00:58:14.579
and thank them for their Christian love and example of faith.

00:58:14.579 --> 00:58:19.530
Thank you for watching.

00:58:19.530 --> 00:58:22.530
From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:58:22.530 --> 00:58:24.530
this is JW Broadcasting.
