00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.980
Now, we would like to hear some challenges or trials that you've faced throughout those

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:06.980
years.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.019
Brother Murray, could you start for us?

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:10.019
It's interesting.

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.900
In the work we had a lot of travel.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.059
We've always had a lot of travel, of course, that's why it's called travel and work.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.500
And in South America and Guyana, we would sometimes travel for weeks and never ride in a car.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:28.620
We'd ride by plane, boat or some other way.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.259
As far as accommodations, they were very humble in Guyana.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.820
They were also very humble here in this country at times, but also very luxurious at times.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.060
But there's something that both places had in common.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.939
The brothers always provided us the best they had, the best they could.

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:51.939
And it's interesting, Sister Murray and I spent over half of our career in the travel

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:54.340
and work in homes.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.460
And some of our strongest, most enduring relationships were built with people that we stayed with

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.579
in their homes over the years.

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.980
And quite frankly, I strongly recommend that as a way to really strengthen your relationship

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.459
with the brothers.

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:13.579
Now you're telling me another challenge you faced last minute assignments from the branch.

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:20.140
As an example, last year on a Thursday, the first week in the service year, I got a call

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.140
early in the morning.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.900
I mean, before seven, from the branch asking me if I could go to Wisconsin to fill in

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.340
for a district overseer.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.299
And that was on Thursday.

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.500
I said, when do you want me to go?

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.340
They said, I want you to go tomorrow for the weekend.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.019
I didn't have the talks up.

00:01:38.019 --> 00:01:41.060
And there were four talks I had to get up.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.219
So I did what seemed to be the easiest thing I called some traveling brother friends and

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:50.060
said, similar outlines, it'll help me get my talks up.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.260
They did.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.099
And I think that's the benefit of having a strong relationship with your fellow traveling

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:57.099
brothers.

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:58.099
Help you get your talks up.

00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:59.099
Absolutely.

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:00.099
Very good.

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:01.099
Thank you.

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:03.900
Brother Episcopos, some challenges that you faced.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:10.219
And Bolivia, when I entered the circuit work in November of 1956, the main mode of travel

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:11.860
was on trucks.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.020
And the whole country, which is two and a half times the size of California, was my circuit.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.780
I only had five congregations in the whole country, the rest were isolated groups.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.379
And I had the privilege of introducing the truth into a number of villages.

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.900
There were challenges, but I was young and strong.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.659
Our great challenge came in 1964 when we had to leave our precious assignment and start

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:39.379
parenting.

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:44.900
And I must admit that I wasted about a year feeling sorry for myself.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.259
Well, I started to hear my own negativity.

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:52.060
And with Jehovah's help, I said, get on with it.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.580
There's life after children.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.580
And sure enough, we worked and pursued the goal of getting back into this.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.419
And in 1986, after our boys were raised, we were ready to get back into this.

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:07.340
We were able to get back into the special full-time service.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.340
Oh.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.340
Beautiful.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.939
Brother Thompson, some of your trials and challenges?

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:19.659
I'd like to relate this experience when waiting for an assignment upon leaving Bethel.

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:26.699
And my wife said, there are two places I don't want to go because of the social issues.

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:29.219
Mississippi and Alabama.

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:33.939
Well, Alabama was the first assignment.

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:37.099
And Mississippi was the third assignment.

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:42.379
And we loved it because Jehovah's molded us and trained us.

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:47.580
It was a beautiful experience that helped us to be prepared for the work he had assigned

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.300
for us to do.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:57.379
And on a list of challenges, I would say, dealing without aging parents is one and also

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.580
health concern on my part.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:08.659
In the case of my mother-in-law, it proved to be a time of great anxiety for Verneese

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:14.099
since she couldn't be there to give her assistance, although she had a brother and two sisters

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.220
that looked after her.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.740
And in my case, my brothers and sisters, I'm the oldest of eight.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.980
They were very supportive to me in my work.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.899
And if there was a crisis with my parents, I was the last to know about it.

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:32.939
They resolved things and then they would inform me.

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:35.660
And I appreciated that so much.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:42.740
If my concern as health, it was, I guess, about eight or nine years ago, I was diagnosed

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.339
with prostate cancer.

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:48.740
And so the organization was very supportive.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.980
I was wondering, worried about the expense of it, how it would be cared for.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:02.579
And so they let me decide a certain treatment, a robotic surgery that happened in Alabama.

00:05:02.579 --> 00:05:04.899
And not a worry at all.

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:09.500
So I never lost any sleep or concern over it.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.339
And I appreciate to this day the support the branch office provided.

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:14.339
Good.

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:15.819
Thank you, brothers, for your expression.

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:19.100
Obviously, you and your wives have dealt with various trials.
