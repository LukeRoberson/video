WEBVTT

00:01:42.129 --> 00:01:44.129
You'll keep going. I think I might have a signal

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.810
Come on

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.010
Where are we going? Yeah, we head into the camp

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:04.230
You should be worried that something's gonna eat you what may you'll be

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:07.109
Be nice to your sister

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:09.270
You two have to start looking out for each other

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:12.389
Okay, even on the road people are looking to hurt us

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:17.150
The verbose would be searching the road and we have to stay close together

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.629
Do not let us out of your sight

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.270
Understand yes

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.710
Come on, we'll be safe once we reach the camp

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:36.569
Have you been able to reach anyone?

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.169
There's barely enough signal to send a text let alone call anyone

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.009
I was able to get a test from in awkward this morning. We should be able to catch up to them soon

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.569
Hopefully by tomorrow

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.930
How much longer do we have to go

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:56.330
It's going to be a wash till Zouadi

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:04.500
Maybe I have a man go for you may on be stay close

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:19.360
Good come on son. You need to keep moving

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.750
Just taste you

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.100
Good to see you

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.410
You know call oh man

00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:36.170
What's that? I'm running my son

00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:55.089
It's happened so quickly when I got the call I grabbed my go bag and that was it

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:59.769
We seen a few others from the congregation headed for the camp as well

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.769
But see fine. I waiting to slow move in groups

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.620
See for are you okay?

00:08:08.779 --> 00:08:13.500
A little bit tired. Oh here. Let me hold your back for a bit. Oh, thank you

00:08:14.379 --> 00:08:19.180
Thank you. I have some more time for this you need it too. Oh see for

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.860
I'm so proud of you

00:08:23.259 --> 00:08:25.980
You were prepared even more than we were

00:08:28.339 --> 00:08:31.379
Musa can I talk to you about something sure man

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.220
I am so sorry

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:38.419
I should have listened

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.419
My son

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:42.419
No one is perfect

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:47.059
Don't dwell on your mistakes. Chobo is patient with us

00:08:48.259 --> 00:08:50.820
We correct our mistakes and we move on

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:56.580
Take it from an old man. There are many more lessons to learn

00:08:57.779 --> 00:09:02.500
You're too kind to me Musa. Thank you so much. Oh, you're welcome my son. You're welcome

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:13.059
You remember the account of the Apostle Paul

00:09:14.019 --> 00:09:16.500
No, no, no, no, no, I don't I don't

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:28.009
He traveled many miles for Chobo does anyone remember some of the things that happened to him

00:09:29.529 --> 00:09:31.529
He was shipwrecked

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:33.529
Four times actually

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:36.090
Didn't people try to kill him?

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:39.559
Yes

00:09:39.639 --> 00:09:44.379
We know what that's like

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.779
But Paul relied on Chobo

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.340
He trusted him completely

00:09:54.009 --> 00:09:55.690
His example teaches us

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.970
That we can face dangerous situations

00:10:00.009 --> 00:10:03.049
And with Chobo's help we can make it through

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:08.889
Paul's faith in God's promises help him to he do

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.970
You've been talking about these ghost promises

00:10:14.009 --> 00:10:20.299
Since we were kids

00:10:20.299 --> 00:10:23.610
Yes, Dunia

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:26.759
It is true

00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:30.519
I've been waiting on Chobo's promises for a long time

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:35.980
Perhaps even longer than I expected

00:10:41.289 --> 00:10:43.129
It wasn't immediate for Paul

00:10:46.549 --> 00:10:49.669
But every one of Chobo's promises came true

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.840
Not one word of his has failed

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:01.899
It's the same today

00:11:01.899 --> 00:11:03.740
Knowing Chobo's promises

00:11:05.259 --> 00:11:07.659
Helps us to endure these situations

00:11:08.299 --> 00:11:12.059
patiently

00:11:12.059 --> 00:11:14.220
You learn these things when you were a child

00:11:16.519 --> 00:11:19.799
Now you have grown up

00:11:19.799 --> 00:11:21.399
Now that Chobo loves you

00:11:23.879 --> 00:11:25.240
He wants to protect you

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.970
Notice what he tells us in his word

00:11:31.769 --> 00:11:33.769
At Isaiah for the Ace chapter

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.350
Notice verse 17

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:40.710
I Chobo

00:12:05.529 --> 00:12:06.009
Amani

00:12:06.889 --> 00:12:07.370
Amani

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:09.529
I was speaking to the group

00:12:09.529 --> 00:12:10.330
They are heading back

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:13.289
They said I can't visit a few days ahead

00:12:14.169 --> 00:12:16.809
But that's what people don't move at a normal speed

00:12:16.809 --> 00:12:17.289
Looking at

00:12:17.769 --> 00:12:19.129
Sifar and Babam is that

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:21.769
Do you think we will ever get there

00:12:22.649 --> 00:12:24.809
They even said the company is overcrowded

00:12:24.809 --> 00:12:28.740
What if we get there and we can't even get in

00:12:30.259 --> 00:12:31.700
I really don't know

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:32.899
Amani, you don't know

00:12:34.259 --> 00:12:36.419
It's about time you make that decision for the family

00:12:37.299 --> 00:12:38.419
This is about us

00:12:39.059 --> 00:12:40.740
We can't always be following the group

00:12:42.259 --> 00:12:43.059
You know what

00:12:44.019 --> 00:12:45.059
Let me think about it

00:12:45.059 --> 00:12:45.539
Okay

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:52.309
Come on

00:12:52.309 --> 00:12:53.110
Amani

00:13:04.539 --> 00:13:05.899
Brothers

00:13:05.899 --> 00:13:07.740
I was able to get a text from your Chobo

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.740
It seems most from the congregation have made it across the border

00:13:13.019 --> 00:13:15.019
Oh, that's wonderful news

00:13:15.019 --> 00:13:16.860
How's the situation there

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.299
You know with so many fleeing

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.700
The camp is overwhelmed

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:23.259
But our brothers are there waiting to get in

00:13:23.899 --> 00:13:26.299
It's good to know that they made it safely

00:13:26.299 --> 00:13:27.340
And how you liked it

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:31.500
Your Chobo women mentioned that there's a small kingdom hall and a congregation

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:33.179
Inside the camp

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.220
But that's all the message said

00:13:37.659 --> 00:13:38.299
But brothers

00:13:39.019 --> 00:13:40.940
It's good to know that we aren't far off

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.100
I'm so sorry. I'm slowing the group down

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:48.539
I'm not as strong as I used to be

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:50.379
Not since

00:13:50.379 --> 00:13:50.860
Musa

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:53.980
We are holding this together

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.710
Musa

00:15:14.149 --> 00:15:14.470
Yes

00:15:15.429 --> 00:15:16.309
But you saw what

00:15:42.179 --> 00:15:43.299
You know we were thinking

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:47.350
Let's stop and rest here

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:51.029
For a few days before we continue on to the camp

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.960
I don't think I can contain

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:58.759
Of course you can

00:16:01.129 --> 00:16:02.169
We will help you

00:16:03.929 --> 00:16:07.990
Amani

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:08.950
I'm too weak

00:16:12.169 --> 00:16:12.649
My son

00:16:14.759 --> 00:16:25.779
Don't be here, Chobo

00:16:25.779 --> 00:16:27.299
I'm not ready to say goodbye

00:16:32.759 --> 00:16:33.960
Mrs. Nagribai

00:16:38.899 --> 00:16:39.779
Remember Amani

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:42.179
Your strength

00:16:43.539 --> 00:16:43.940
Will be

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:45.779
In keeping calm

00:16:48.659 --> 00:16:49.620
In showing trust

00:16:54.539 --> 00:16:56.940
Chobo will fulfill his promises

00:17:00.139 --> 00:17:01.019
Just be patient

00:17:08.039 --> 00:17:08.680
We should read

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.680
Just promises to me

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:16.619
I would like to

00:17:19.049 --> 00:17:19.849
Yeah, his voice

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:27.880
Just a little while longer

00:17:36.259 --> 00:17:37.299
We could do we no more

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:42.630
You look at where they were

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:45.910
And they will not be there

00:17:48.119 --> 00:17:48.920
But the meek

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.000
Will pose us the earth

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:54.890
And they will find a squishy delight

00:17:55.529 --> 00:17:56.809
In the abundance of peace

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.019
We didn't sleep

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:39.619
Thinking about Musa

00:18:44.279 --> 00:18:45.319
I miss him too

00:18:48.259 --> 00:18:49.220
I'm scared, Dad

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:52.500
What if we can't make it to the camp

00:18:53.539 --> 00:18:55.539
What if something happens to your mom

00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:58.950
Well

00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:59.990
Something should happen

00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:02.150
Just keep heading to the camp

00:19:03.109 --> 00:19:04.789
And find a congregation inside

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:07.589
That's your family

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:09.190
You'd be safe

00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.950
Okay

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:14.569
And son

00:19:16.009 --> 00:19:18.089
Chobo will always be with you

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:21.690
All you have to do is just trust in him

00:19:23.829 --> 00:19:24.950
Just like Musa did

00:19:28.309 --> 00:19:29.509
Musa was strong

00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:32.470
Because of his virtual routine

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:34.869
He gave power

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:37.829
From reading God's word regularly

00:19:42.599 --> 00:19:43.079
May only

00:19:45.339 --> 00:19:46.299
You can do the same

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:47.420
Here

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:49.980
He wanted you to have it

00:19:58.869 --> 00:20:00.230
I know you're not gonna forget him

00:20:05.299 --> 00:20:07.059
And if you cannot forget him

00:20:07.299 --> 00:20:08.420
Think about Jehovah

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:14.009
He always remembers his loyal ones

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:15.690
Like Musa

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:26.819
Before we leave yet

00:20:26.819 --> 00:20:29.059
I want to say a few words to the group

00:20:29.059 --> 00:20:29.859
About Musa

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:32.630
When I do

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:35.349
You think it could help me by reading Job Chapter 14

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:36.549
Okay

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:41.779
Now

00:20:42.339 --> 00:20:43.619
When you read from it

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.140
Do it in a way that shows you know

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.420
Every word of it

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:49.140
To be true

00:20:50.819 --> 00:20:52.019
It comes from Jehovah

00:20:54.359 --> 00:20:55.559
Should we read together now

00:20:56.039 --> 00:20:56.519
Okay

00:20:58.359 --> 00:20:59.240
If a man dies

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:00.839
Can he live again

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:05.079
I'll wait all the days of my compulsory service

00:21:05.079 --> 00:21:06.519
Until my relief comes

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:15.700
You'll call

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:17.140
And I want to

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.170
Do that

00:21:20.410 --> 00:22:49.589
Oh wait

00:22:49.589 --> 00:22:50.390
I'm sorry

00:22:53.319 --> 00:22:54.440
I need to take a break

00:22:57.799 --> 00:22:58.279
It's okay

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.420
This is a good place to come for the night

00:23:05.259 --> 00:23:05.900
Okay, Sifu

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:07.819
I'll get you okay feet

00:23:32.869 --> 00:23:34.549
Let me see if I can find you some more water

00:23:35.109 --> 00:23:35.910
Thank you Noko

00:23:39.289 --> 00:23:39.769
Bomby

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:42.490
Can you help me get more firewood

00:23:43.529 --> 00:23:44.329
Okay, come on

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.950
There is good news

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:57.109
Tens of settled back home

00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:59.750
Don't yet

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:00.549
Not right now

00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:01.029
Come on

00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.509
Keep up

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:03.829
I was speaking with the group up there

00:24:05.109 --> 00:24:06.710
They have enough supplies

00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:08.789
We can join them and go back

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:10.150
Don't yet

00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:12.230
Do you see Sifu

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:15.029
We need to get Sifu help

00:24:15.509 --> 00:24:18.069
We need to get her in the camp as soon as possible

00:24:18.069 --> 00:24:19.349
We don't have to live in the camp

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:21.509
We can have everything all back

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:25.670
The house, the land, even the job, the near way

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:25.910
Wait

00:24:29.559 --> 00:24:30.039
Kids

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.039
Run

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:56.220
Anything

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:00.009
Nothing yet

00:27:01.849 --> 00:27:03.849
But the money in the near is still searching

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:09.109
How's Farajan done

00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:11.430
Not good

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:17.910
We're going to get through this

00:27:23.059 --> 00:27:23.859
Jawadi

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:25.779
Maombi

00:27:32.779 --> 00:27:33.500
Maombi

00:27:35.859 --> 00:27:36.420
Big brother

00:27:39.349 --> 00:27:40.150
Know you tired

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.990
Well

00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:43.589
We're going to find them

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:45.990
We're going to find them

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:47.829
I know they are smart kids

00:27:48.789 --> 00:27:49.829
They will know to head back

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:53.269
What do you mean

00:27:54.869 --> 00:27:55.430
Think of it

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:57.430
If you were a kid lost

00:27:59.509 --> 00:28:00.230
Where would you go

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.990
Home

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.859
You remember when we were kids on the road fleeing

00:28:09.299 --> 00:28:11.299
That was the only place we knew to go

00:28:12.019 --> 00:28:12.339
Home

00:28:14.869 --> 00:28:17.269
I know for sure that these kids are heading back home

00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:18.710
Maombi trust me on that

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:21.190
I don't know

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.670
Maombi

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:23.029
Wake up

00:28:25.859 --> 00:28:27.779
We've searched everywhere

00:28:27.779 --> 00:28:28.339
For the kids

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:31.859
And look at Sifu

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.019
She is suffering

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:36.420
Where is Papa Musana

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:39.299
We just buried Papa Musana

00:28:39.299 --> 00:28:39.940
He is dead

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.630
Wake up

00:28:43.509 --> 00:28:45.509
Are you still trusting these people to guide your life

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.359
Remember my money

00:28:52.279 --> 00:28:53.079
Your strength

00:28:54.359 --> 00:28:54.920
Will be

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:56.599
In keeping calm

00:28:58.519 --> 00:28:59.480
In showing trust

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:02.859
I'm citing that

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.460
Jehovah will fulfill his promises

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:09.640
Just be patient

00:29:14.099 --> 00:29:14.819
No dunia

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.119
I thought I knew best

00:29:19.079 --> 00:29:21.960
Look I put my family in danger when I ignored direction

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:23.960
But you know what

00:29:25.079 --> 00:29:26.680
These people love Jehovah

00:29:27.559 --> 00:29:29.000
And is Jehovah

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.519
Who is guiding our lives

00:29:32.279 --> 00:29:33.559
I'm trusting in Jehovah

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.680
We are continuing on to the camp

00:29:37.559 --> 00:29:38.279
I'm money

00:29:38.279 --> 00:29:39.799
I'm very very sorry then

00:29:40.519 --> 00:29:41.480
I can't help you then

00:29:43.079 --> 00:29:43.799
That's for me

00:29:44.519 --> 00:29:45.480
I am going home

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.240
Dunia

00:29:55.539 --> 00:29:56.019
Dunia

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:22.099
Father Jehovah

00:30:24.019 --> 00:30:25.140
Please help me

00:30:40.069 --> 00:30:40.869
Most dunia

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:44.140
He left

00:30:45.259 --> 00:30:45.900
He left

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:47.980
He's going back

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:50.380
What about the children

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:56.569
We're going to find them

00:30:57.289 --> 00:30:58.730
They could be anywhere

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:01.450
I know love

00:31:02.809 --> 00:31:03.930
But they are not alone

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:07.130
Jehovah is going to help them

00:31:08.089 --> 00:31:09.609
It's our job to protect them

00:31:09.609 --> 00:31:10.650
Where the parents

00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:11.609
They're just kids

00:31:14.089 --> 00:31:14.730
You're right

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:19.460
And we trained them to be obedient

00:31:20.259 --> 00:31:22.660
We did tell them if anything they go wrong

00:31:22.819 --> 00:31:24.339
They were to keep going to the camp

00:31:24.339 --> 00:31:25.539
And find a congregation

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:28.019
There is no way

00:31:28.019 --> 00:31:30.180
I'm living here without my babies

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:30.819
I can't

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:34.980
Fraja

00:31:36.259 --> 00:31:37.859
I saw them run into the woods

00:31:38.819 --> 00:31:39.940
They got away

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:46.119
They could be waiting for us

00:31:48.539 --> 00:31:49.900
They are sticking to the plan

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:55.259
I'm money is right

00:31:55.259 --> 00:31:56.619
And we'll keep searching for them

00:31:56.619 --> 00:31:57.740
In the direction of the camp

00:32:08.059 --> 00:32:11.099
This would be a good time for us to ask for Jehovah's help

00:32:12.539 --> 00:32:13.500
Why don't we do that

00:32:14.299 --> 00:32:15.259
And where's Jehovah?

00:32:15.259 --> 00:32:16.460
You care for the kids as well

00:32:17.339 --> 00:32:17.660
Okay

00:33:31.799 --> 00:33:32.200
No, go

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.759
Please stay with her

00:33:34.759 --> 00:33:36.200
We'll keep looking for the kids

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.000
Okay

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.200
See if they'll take care of you

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.960
I'll go ahead and see if somebody has seen the kids

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:51.029
Excuse me

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:53.349
Have you seen these two around here?

00:33:54.309 --> 00:33:54.789
This one

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:56.069
By this tall?

00:33:56.869 --> 00:33:57.190
No

00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.670
No

00:33:57.670 --> 00:33:58.309
On the girl?

00:33:59.430 --> 00:33:59.829
No

00:33:59.829 --> 00:34:00.069
No

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:04.940
You seen these two kids?

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:06.539
No

00:34:06.539 --> 00:34:07.500
Girls about this tall

00:34:08.059 --> 00:34:09.099
Not even on the way here

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:25.940
You seen these two kids?

00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:26.900
No

00:34:38.019 --> 00:34:38.500
Excuse me

00:34:40.179 --> 00:34:41.380
You see these two kids coming?

00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:43.139
We have so many kids coming through

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:45.460
Here are your food ration cards

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:49.059
Make sure to pick up your 10 items behind you

00:34:49.059 --> 00:34:50.820
And you get more information to next steps

00:34:51.539 --> 00:34:52.099
Keep moving

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:53.300
Next

00:34:59.909 --> 00:35:19.719
He's the brother's

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.239
My son's

00:35:30.889 --> 00:35:31.690
Zewati?

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:32.409
Zewati!

00:35:32.409 --> 00:35:32.889
Zewati!

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:13.980
I'm so proud of you, my little man

00:36:15.099 --> 00:36:15.579
Thank you

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:17.340
You are so brave

00:36:18.619 --> 00:36:20.380
You two good care of Zewati

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:21.820
Why are you two out there alone?

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:23.260
What?

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:23.659
Dad

00:36:24.619 --> 00:36:26.460
How much longer do we have to be here?

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:28.380
We don't know

00:36:31.059 --> 00:36:32.099
We just have to wait

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:34.420
Patiently

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:36.900
But

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:38.340
Are we ever going to go back home?

00:36:47.239 --> 00:36:47.559
Well

00:36:48.679 --> 00:36:49.880
Remember what Musa said

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.800
We have to commit our way to Jehovah

00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:58.199
All of this

00:36:59.159 --> 00:37:00.519
It is just temporary

00:37:08.059 --> 00:37:09.659
What does the Bible say

00:37:10.219 --> 00:37:11.659
Jehovah's promises are

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:14.860
That they're everlasting

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:15.739
Yeah

00:37:16.539 --> 00:37:17.260
It's sadly

00:37:18.219 --> 00:37:18.780
Forever

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.280
This can't live

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.000
I'm not the ideal

00:37:26.599 --> 00:37:28.199
But we're going to make the best out of it

00:37:29.079 --> 00:37:29.800
But how

00:37:31.909 --> 00:37:33.829
We just have to focus on what we have

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:35.269
We are safe

00:37:36.469 --> 00:37:37.429
We have the brothers

00:37:38.389 --> 00:37:39.429
You know the congregation

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:42.070
But most importantly we have Jehovah

00:37:42.869 --> 00:37:44.309
And we have each other

00:37:44.309 --> 00:37:45.030
Of course

00:37:45.989 --> 00:37:47.110
We do have each other

00:37:49.219 --> 00:37:49.460
And

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:52.980
We really are going to try

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:54.500
To make this place feel like home

00:37:56.699 --> 00:37:59.099
That will mean school for you and Zewati

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:01.420
Yeah I know

00:38:03.099 --> 00:38:04.539
And the ministry for all of us

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:06.460
Meetings

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:08.219
Family worship

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:10.539
And helping those in need

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:13.099
That's soccer

00:38:14.219 --> 00:38:14.780
Of course

00:38:15.579 --> 00:38:16.380
Playing soccer

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:17.980
You love soccer too much

00:38:19.579 --> 00:38:20.780
You ready to show me what you got

00:38:21.179 --> 00:38:21.980
Yeah come on

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:23.260
Let's go

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.639
Committing our way to Jehovah

00:39:17.639 --> 00:39:18.840
Requires faith

00:39:19.639 --> 00:39:20.679
And obedience

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:29.300
Our faith is not just a thought or feeling

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:34.360
For we are absolutely convinced

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:36.039
That Jehovah's way of doing things

00:39:36.679 --> 00:39:37.960
Is always right

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:46.170
We also show that we trust Jehovah

00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:49.610
When we obey the direction

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:51.690
Receive from his organization

00:39:51.690 --> 00:40:02.730
It has not always been easy

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:07.659
But we have seen the blessing that come from listening

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:15.619
And obeying

00:40:15.619 --> 00:40:18.260
We have to trust those whom Jehovah trust

00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:23.929
Even if we may not understand the direction at the time

00:40:33.579 --> 00:40:35.900
Strengthening our commitment to Jehovah now

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:42.940
Will cause us to obey him implicitly in the future

00:40:48.329 --> 00:40:50.889
Please convince yourself every day

00:40:52.329 --> 00:40:55.929
That all of Jehovah's promises for the future will come true

00:41:02.219 --> 00:41:03.739
And never forget

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:08.059
The words are Psalm 37 verse 5

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.340
Commit your way to Jehovah

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:15.190
rely on him

00:41:18.039 --> 00:41:20.039
And he will act in your behalf

00:41:26.579 --> 00:41:28.099
Our dear baptismal candidates

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:29.619
Is that time

00:41:30.659 --> 00:41:32.420
We invite you to please stand
