00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.219
and introduction to the Book of Philemon.

00:00:06.219 --> 00:00:11.220
Paul wrote this letter primarily to his friend and spiritual brother Philemon,

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.469
who lived in the city of Kalasi in Asia Minor.

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:19.469
Written in Rome about 60 or 61 CE,

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:24.469
the letter concerns Philemon's runaway slave, Onesimus.

00:00:24.469 --> 00:00:28.469
Onesimus somehow became associated with Paul and Rome,

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:33.390
and soon became a Christian.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.390
The letter to Philemon has just 25 verses.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.390
Paul opens with greetings to Philemon and to the congregation that meets in his house,

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.390
including Afia and Archipis.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.390
Paul tells Philemon that Onesimus, once considered a useless slave,

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.390
is now a valuable spiritual brother,

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.390
so much so that Paul would like Onesimus to stay for some time in Rome.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:08.390
But Paul does not overstep his authority by insisting that Onesimus stay without his master's permission.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.390
So Paul sends Onesimus back to Philemon,

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.930
who lives more than 1,400 kilometers away.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.930
On the basis of Christian love and personal friendship,

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.930
Paul appeals to Philemon to receive Onesimus, not as a runaway slave,

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.930
but as a beloved brother.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.930
Paul even writes the entire letter in his own hand, which is unusual for him.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.680
Did you know?

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.680
The letter to Philemon was Paul's only inspired letter addressed primarily

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.680
to a private person about a private matter.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.680
The letter could be considered a reintroduction for Onesimus,

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.680
a slave who is now also a brother.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.680
Paul expresses confidence that Philemon will do even more than what is asked.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.250
As you read the letter to Philemon,

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.250
note how we can express confidence in our brothers.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.250
How Paul showed genuine humility by not overstepping his authority

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.250
and how he highlighted kindness and forgiveness,

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.250
qualities that must be displayed by all who want to inherit God's kingdom.
