00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.649
As your sun rose up from the Jordan,

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.250
And your precious words filled his heart,

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:52.649
He was deeply and he longed to play his part.

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:00.939
He refused to yield to temptation.

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:07.379
He was jealous for your name.

00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:13.989
He gave everything he could.

00:01:13.989 --> 00:01:17.989
And I longed to do the...

00:01:17.989 --> 00:02:03.709
I think this joy is real.

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:19.879
This is real.

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:21.879
As I've come to,

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:31.960
I've found him inside.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.960
I will glad,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.759
And your truth,

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:50.139
I erving side by side with my brother.

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:54.060
There's no better.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:31.659
This joy is real.

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:32.659
I will...
