00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.620
Let's look at the entirety of Melachi chapter 3 and verse 16.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.619
In fact, what we'll do is read just the first part of it.

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:12.619
Melachi 3, 16.

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:18.620
At that time, those who feared Jehovah spoke with one another,

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.620
each one with his companion,

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:27.620
and Jehovah kept paying attention and listening.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.619
Now, did you notice that Jehovah is paying attention and listening to how we speak

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.619
to one another?

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:39.619
Why would Jehovah record the names of those who do just that,

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:42.619
speaking to one another in the way that pleases him?

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:48.619
Why would he list them in the book of life?

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:53.619
Well, it's because our speech reflects what's in our hearts.

00:00:53.619 --> 00:01:01.619
Jesus said, as we all know, a good man brings forth a good treasure out of his heart.

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:07.620
But a wicked man brings forth what is wicked out of his wicked treasure

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.620
for out of the heart's abundance, the mouth speaks.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.620
Now, that's pretty deep.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:20.620
What we say reflects what we really are inside.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:28.620
When we think about others, it's much easier to say things in a negative way.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.620
The saying is that it's easier to tear down a building than it is to build one new.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.620
And all of us have faults.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.620
King Solomon said, there's no righteous man in the earth that keeps doing good

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.620
and does not sin.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:54.620
Now, it takes a lot for us to have the gift of finding good.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:00.620
It does not take so much to identify someone's shortcomings.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:07.620
And we have to be careful how we talk to and about each other.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:14.620
What helps is if we focus on people the way Jehovah sees them.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.620
It calls them precious.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.620
And we all remember so well the words of Jesus at John, chapter 6, verse 44,

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.620
that no one comes to me unless the father who sent me draws him.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.620
So every one of Jehovah's dedicated people have been drawn by him,

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.620
in spite of their quirks and challenging personalities.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:46.620
Yet that one pronoun there to our quirks and personalities.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.620
But Jehovah sees positive things in every one of us,

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.620
even though we feel that some have challenging personalities.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.620
But by putting forth every effort to identify each other's good qualities,

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.620
the reason to speak positively to them and about them.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.620
It's easy to talk about someone in a negative way.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.620
But imagine if we have to say to them what we say to others about them,

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.620
then it should conjure up in us every effort to be positive.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.620
Now, it doesn't mean that we shouldn't offer counsel if we see the need to offer.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.620
It's not a matter of offering counsel or not.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.620
It's a matter of how it's delivered.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.620
Let's notice what the Bible says in James chapter 1 and verse 26.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.620
We've all read it many times.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.620
It makes a powerful point.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:53.620
There, James says, if any man thinks he's a worshiper of God.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.620
So he's not talking to people on the outside.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.620
He's talking to those within the congregation.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.620
We're a worshiper of God.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.620
And we do not keep a tight reign on our tongue.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.620
What does he say?

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.620
He is deceiving his own heart and his worship is futile.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.620
So how we use our tongue is a serious matter before Jehovah.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.620
Jehovah would not be pleased with us if we talk one way,

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.620
we find gracious in meetings and in the ministry,

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.620
but spoke harshly at other times.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.620
Now, go back to Melachi, if you would, in chapter 3 again, and verse 17.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:49.899
And notice the declarations Jehovah makes about such ones who watch their speech.

00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:55.899
And they will be mine, says Jehovah of armies,

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:59.899
in the day when I produce a special property.

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:01.899
Now, that's really something.

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:04.899
Parents have a special bond with their children.

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:09.899
A single man was visiting his friend who was married and had two children.

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:12.899
And he observed the little girl.

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:17.899
She was about five years old, but she was so in need of attention,

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:19.899
almost distracting her father.

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:22.899
And a little boy, three, was hyper, running around.

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:26.899
And a young man said, why do you love your children?

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:32.899
And the father thought for a moment and said, because they're mine.

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:35.899
Is that true?

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:38.899
Parents have a special bond with children.

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:40.899
They overlook certain things.

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:42.899
That's my child.

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:46.899
Well, Jehovah feels much more of an attachment to his dedicated servants

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:49.899
than earthly fathers to their children.

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:53.899
Notice verse 17 continues,

00:05:53.899 --> 00:06:01.269
I will show them compassion just as a man shows compassion to his son.

00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:04.269
When I hope Jehovah shows compassion to such imperfect ones,

00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:12.779
because they're his, really, our speech should reflect his view,

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:17.779
keeping in mind that we're included in these imperfect children

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:21.779
that he overlooks the shortcomings of.

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:26.779
The Bible realistically says, we all stumble many times,

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:29.779
not once in a while, many times.

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:32.779
If anyone doesn't stumble in word, he's a perfect man.

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:38.779
And we know, as the Bible writer knows, there's no such one today.

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:41.779
But the effort of Jehovah's people to have upbuilding speeches,

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:44.779
that's what sets us apart.

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:47.779
Now we go to verse 18 in Malachi, chapter 3.

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:53.019
And you will again see the distinction between the righteous person

00:06:53.019 --> 00:07:00.019
and a wicked person, between one serving God and one not serving him.

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:02.019
Think about that.

00:07:02.019 --> 00:07:06.019
I view this text really as Jehovah's way of commending his people

00:07:06.019 --> 00:07:10.019
for making every effort to use positive good speech.

00:07:10.019 --> 00:07:13.019
And it's good for all of us to keep that in mind,

00:07:13.019 --> 00:07:17.019
and all of us to make a self-evaluation from time to time.

00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:20.019
And if we have a measure of authority,

00:07:20.019 --> 00:07:24.019
whether it be in the congregation or secondly,

00:07:24.019 --> 00:07:28.019
we should be particularly aware of how we talk to

00:07:28.019 --> 00:07:32.019
and about our fellow workers.

00:07:32.019 --> 00:07:36.019
We're surrounded in a world in which bullying,

00:07:36.019 --> 00:07:42.019
being curt in speech and cutting people off, is common.

00:07:42.019 --> 00:07:48.019
That's why the dwelling manual issued to special full-time service,

00:07:48.019 --> 00:07:52.019
the manual dwelling together in unity, it says this.

00:07:52.019 --> 00:07:57.019
In these evil days, we need to pay more than the usual attention

00:07:57.019 --> 00:08:01.019
to the Scriptures so that we will not be overtaken by the customs

00:08:01.019 --> 00:08:05.019
and spirit of this wicked system of things.

00:08:05.019 --> 00:08:08.019
And then it cites to Scriptures, 1 Corinthians 2, 12,

00:08:08.019 --> 00:08:13.019
and Hebrews chapter 2 verses 1 to 3.

00:08:13.019 --> 00:08:18.019
Interestingly, the watchtower of 2022, the April edition,

00:08:18.019 --> 00:08:24.019
has as a heading, our speech matters to Jehovah.

00:08:24.019 --> 00:08:29.019
And therein is the artwork that you see depicted.

00:08:29.019 --> 00:08:35.019
And it's depicting opportunities for bad speech.

00:08:35.019 --> 00:08:39.019
Interestingly, the caption under this picture says,

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:45.019
on the left, a brother reacts harshly to an angry householder.

00:08:45.019 --> 00:08:48.019
And this is very interesting, the center picture,

00:08:48.019 --> 00:08:51.019
a brother holds back from singing in the congregation.

00:08:51.019 --> 00:08:56.019
Now that was included in the article regarding speech matters.

00:08:56.019 --> 00:09:02.019
And then at the end, a sister engages in harmful gossip.

00:09:02.019 --> 00:09:07.019
So we're receiving good instruction from the faithful slave in this area.

00:09:07.019 --> 00:09:11.019
So may we all continue to speak in a way that draws attention

00:09:11.019 --> 00:09:14.019
to Jehovah's way of dealing with people,

00:09:14.019 --> 00:09:18.019
and draws us ever closer to him and to each other.
