00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:08.689
The city of Cessaria and its harbor were built by Herod the Great toward the end of the

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:11.289
1st century BCE.

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:15.490
He named the city after Caesar Augustus.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:22.570
Located about 87 km or 54 miles north-west of Jerusalem on the Mediterranean coast, Cessaria

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.850
became an important maritime hub.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:34.350
We will see one, a Roman theatre, two, a palace, three, a hippopotamus, and two, a

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:44.600
hippodrome, four, a pagan temple, and five, a man-made harbor.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.920
This video of the ruins of Cessaria includes reconstructions, showing what these main buildings

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.750
may have looked like.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.429
The city included the Roman theatre shown here on the right.

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:04.590
In 1961, in the ruins of this theatre, a stone bearing a Latin inscription that includes

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.870
the name of Pontius Pilate was found.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.150
It was the first such inscription to be found.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.670
Next, we see a palace that extended toward the sea.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.629
It may have been here that Paul, awaiting to be transferred to Rome, was able to give

00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:26.469
a persuasive witness about Jesus to Governor Felix, and later to Governor Festus and King

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:28.590
Agripper II.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.189
A hippodrome, or Stadium for horse racing and other events, was located next to the palace.

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:42.920
This stadium could hold an estimated 30,000 spectators.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:51.719
An aqueduct supplied Cessaria with water, and the city had its own sewer system.

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:54.840
The city had a pagan temple.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:14.879
Its location and size made it a prominent landmark for those on ships entering the harbor.

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.719
The man-made harbor was an engineering marvel.

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:24.400
It was one of the largest seaports of the Roman world, making Cessaria a centre for international

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.680
trade.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.599
The Apostle Paul and other Christians travelled to and from Cessaria by boat.

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.500
Philip the evangeliser travelled to Cessaria at the end of a preaching tour and possibly

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.360
settled there.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.919
The first Gentile Christians, Cornelius and his household, lived in that city.

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:48.039
And it was probably in Cessaria that Luke wrote his gospel.
