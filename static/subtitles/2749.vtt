00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:06.509
People think the Bible says that God controls the world.

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.509
But how could that be?

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:14.980
This world is out of control.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:25.170
It's full of pain and suffering, sickness and death,

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.469
poverty and disaster.

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:33.469
How could a loving God be responsible for all of this?

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.469
What the Bible says may surprise you.

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.570
It says the evil one controls the whole world.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.270
In other words, there's an evil power behind the world's problems,

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.270
someone who is pulling the strings behind the scenes.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.170
That's why, no matter how hard we try,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.469
humans just cannot solve the world's problems.

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:08.670
The good news is, the Bible says things will not always be like this.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.469
It tells us why we're in this situation,

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:17.469
how God will fix it, and how we can deal with it in the meantime.
