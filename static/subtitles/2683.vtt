00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:07.719
A man of understanding acquires skillful direction.

00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:10.720
What is understanding?

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.219
Webster's dictionary defines it as the act of grasping mentally,

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:23.219
or the power of comprehending, analyzing, distinguishing, and judging.

00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:27.519
Insight on the scriptures picks up on that concept of distinguishing

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.519
and indicates that a person with understanding can see into a matter

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:36.520
and figure out how individual components of a situation work

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.520
to create the entire situation.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.520
To illustrate, a person who understands construction

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.520
sees not just a building, but an infrastructure, a design.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.520
He comprehends engineering, power, water, ventilation.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.520
He understands how all of these systems work together

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:05.519
and thus he can either marvel at the structure or point out where more work is needed.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.519
That's a valuable attribute, understanding.

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:17.519
So why does a person with understanding need skillful direction?

00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:21.519
A person with understanding knows four things.

00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:23.519
Let's consider them together.

00:01:23.519 --> 00:01:29.519
First, he understands his own responsibility to think.

00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:33.519
Second, he understands what he lacks.

00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:36.519
Third, he understands what Jehovah can impart,

00:01:36.519 --> 00:01:41.519
and he also understands what others can provide.

00:01:41.519 --> 00:01:43.519
Let's take those one by one.

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:46.519
To begin, please turn to Mark 12.

00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:50.519
Now here Jesus has just explained to one of the scribes

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:53.519
what constitutes the greatest commandment in the law.

00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:59.519
Now note the scribes' acknowledgement here in verse 33.

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:04.519
And to love him, God, with one's whole heart,

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:10.520
with one's whole understanding, and with one's whole strength,

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.520
and to love one's neighbor as oneself is worth far more

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.520
than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.520
Yes, Jehovah expects us to use our brains,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.520
to exercise our consciences, to render sacred service with our power of reason,

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.520
as Hebrews 121 puts it.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.520
So the man of understanding does not expect everybody else to do all the thinking for him.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.520
That is not why he seeks skillful direction on the contrary.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.520
He takes the time to meditate.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.520
He does as much thinking as his Bible-trained conscience is capable of.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.520
He understands what he lacks.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:02.520
He understands that Jehovah expects him to love with his entire understanding.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.520
Now perhaps at this point, you may be thinking to yourself,

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.520
what about Proverbs 3.5 that says that we must not lean or rely on our own understanding?

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.520
Well, that leads to our second point.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.520
The understanding person knows what he does not understand.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.520
He knows what he lacks. Turn please to Proverbs chapter 19.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.520
And see how this is borne out in the following verse.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.520
Proverbs chapter 19 and verse 25.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:41.520
It says strike the ridiculer so that the inexperienced one may become shrewd

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:50.520
and reproof the understanding one so that he will increase in knowledge.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.520
Now a ridiculer just mocks people who think differently.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:01.520
Slapping him serves as a warning to the inexperienced person.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.520
But even an understanding person needs, as it says,

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.520
reproof because he doesn't know everything.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.520
A man of understanding knows what he doesn't know.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.519
He realizes that he may not have all the facts.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.519
He probably doesn't know all of the circumstances.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:26.519
He hasn't seen things through the eyes of other people and he certainly cannot read parts.

00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:27.519
So what is needed?

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:32.519
Skillful direction. Proverbs 11-14 says where there is no,

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:36.519
or when there is no skillful direction, the people fall.

00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:40.519
But there is success through many advisers.

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:43.519
Now each of us does well to think about this when we're on the phone with

00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:48.519
or when we're writing a letter to an individual, a body of elders,

00:04:48.519 --> 00:04:54.519
another department at Bethel, a branch, brothers in general.

00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:58.519
Rather than judging them, appreciate their trust,

00:04:58.519 --> 00:05:03.519
credit them with intelligence, experience, spirituality,

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:09.519
seek insight from people who have seen things from their perspective,

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:12.519
acquire skillful direction.

00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:17.519
More over, notice what it says in chapter 21 and verse 2.

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:21.519
Proverbs 21-2, because we're imperfect,

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:27.519
we don't even realize how limited our own viewpoints appear to other people.

00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:32.519
Thus it says, all of a man's ways seem right to him,

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:36.519
but Jehovah examines the hearts.

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:39.519
And that leads us to our third point.

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:45.519
A man of understanding knows what Jehovah can impart.

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:48.519
Now knowing that we lack wisdom are very first.

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:53.519
Primary course of action is the one stated at James 1-5.

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:57.519
If anyone of you is lacking in wisdom, let him keep on asking God,

00:05:57.519 --> 00:06:01.519
for he gives generously to all and without reproaching.

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:05.519
Understanding has a source.

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:08.519
What is the source of understanding?

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:12.519
Job chapter 28 asks that question twice.

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:17.519
And the conclusion of that chapter says that the fear of Jehovah,

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:21.519
is wisdom and to turn away from bad, is understanding.

00:06:21.519 --> 00:06:25.519
The Psalmist sang, disclosure of your words gives,

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:32.519
like giving understanding to the inexperienced Psalm 119, verse 130.

00:06:32.519 --> 00:06:37.519
And we can't discount what we might call the Bezilell factor.

00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:42.519
Jehovah can enhance our understanding with his Holy Spirit

00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:45.519
and even qualify us to teach others.

00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:48.519
So we trust Jehovah's wisdom.

00:06:48.519 --> 00:06:53.519
Be careful never to assume that while the Bible is excellent,

00:06:53.519 --> 00:06:57.519
sometimes it doesn't go far enough.

00:06:57.519 --> 00:07:02.519
Jesus stamped God's Word as truth.

00:07:02.519 --> 00:07:05.519
And we'll come back to this point in a minute.

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:11.519
But now the Bible also indicates that it is proper to learn from experts.

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:12.519
That's our fourth point.

00:07:12.519 --> 00:07:15.519
An understanding person understands what others can offer.

00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:19.519
Job 1212 says, is not wisdom found among the aged?

00:07:19.519 --> 00:07:23.519
Does not understand income with long life?

00:07:23.519 --> 00:07:25.519
So each of us does well to ask himself,

00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:27.519
have I consulted with older ones?

00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:29.519
Do I associate with them generally?

00:07:29.519 --> 00:07:32.519
If not, am I missing something?

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:36.519
What about people who have experience in finance, mechanics,

00:07:36.519 --> 00:07:39.519
construction, design, linguistics, writing, music,

00:07:39.519 --> 00:07:42.519
any number of other topics?

00:07:42.519 --> 00:07:46.519
Would there be any objection to seeking skillful direction from such experts?

00:07:46.519 --> 00:07:47.519
Well, no.

00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:50.519
A man of understanding acquires skillful direction.

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:55.519
First Chronicles 25, 7 and 8 talks about musicians who were trained.

00:07:55.519 --> 00:07:57.519
All experts.

00:07:57.519 --> 00:08:05.519
And that is in Hebrew the same word that's translated as understanding.

00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:08.519
Daniel chapter 1 indicates that Nebuchadnezzar's chief court official,

00:08:08.519 --> 00:08:13.519
Ashpinaz instructed Daniel Hannonaya Mishail and Aziraya in the writing

00:08:13.519 --> 00:08:15.519
and the language of the Caldians.

00:08:15.519 --> 00:08:20.519
So receiving skillful direction, even from people who do not yet know and love Jehovah,

00:08:20.519 --> 00:08:22.519
is not condemned.

00:08:22.519 --> 00:08:26.519
A person with understanding understands what others can offer.

00:08:26.519 --> 00:08:30.519
But he also realizes that there are limits to what they can offer.

00:08:30.519 --> 00:08:34.519
If you're still in Proverbs chapter 21, notice verse 30,

00:08:34.519 --> 00:08:39.519
which says, there is no wisdom, nor discernment,

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:42.519
nor counsel in opposition to Jehovah.

00:08:42.519 --> 00:08:46.519
So if ever there is a conflict between a so-called expert and Bible principles,

00:08:46.519 --> 00:08:51.519
Bible principles should always win.

00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:57.519
If a written commentary maligns an inspired Bible writer,

00:08:57.519 --> 00:09:00.519
we reject that criticism.

00:09:00.519 --> 00:09:07.519
If a medical procedure violates God's laws, we keep looking for one that doesn't,

00:09:07.519 --> 00:09:13.519
because there is no wisdom, discernment, or counsel in opposition to Jehovah.

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:15.519
So by way of review, what is understanding?

00:09:15.519 --> 00:09:21.519
It's the ability to distinguish how various factors work together to create a situation.

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:27.519
What does the man who acquires understanding or skillful direction understand?

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:31.519
He understands his responsibility to think.

00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:33.519
He understands what he lacks.

00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:39.519
He understands what Jehovah can impart, and he understands what others can provide.

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:45.519
How grateful we are that understanding itself is built into Jehovah's regulations.

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:50.519
And as we keep those regulations, as Moses said at Deuteronomy 4.6,

00:09:50.519 --> 00:09:59.519
others will hear about this and say, this nation is undoubtedly a wise and understanding people.
