00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.009
I'm from Colombia, I have five more sisters.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.009
I learned the truth from a very young age through my parents.

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.009
It was a very active spiritual life.

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.009
My dad lived the truth.

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.010
He wasn't just in the truth.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.010
He lived the truth.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.010
And he always tried to pass that on to us.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.010
He made sure that we never went to school

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.010
without reading the day's text first.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.010
That was essential.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.010
We could be late for school,

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.009
but we couldn't leave the house without reading the text.

00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:38.009
We were a big family, but we were always at the meeting.

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:41.009
We filled two rows.

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:44.009
He was always concerned about the well-being of the brothers.

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:46.009
He was always available.

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:48.009
He was very hospitable.

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:51.009
My mom as well.

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:54.009
So he used to invite his Bible students

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:56.009
and the brothers to our house.

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:59.009
And I remember that he would close the kitchen door,

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:03.009
put on some music, and cook a delicious meal.

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:06.010
He liked to keep everything fun,

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.010
and for us girls to have fun,

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.010
especially when we were together as a family.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.959
He would give each one of us what we needed and enjoyed.

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:21.870
He used to take us for walks on the weekend,

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.870
after the meeting, and after preaching.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:32.430
It was a privilege to have a father like that.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.430
Well, that day, I remember that we were at home.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.219
He was going to put the car in the garage.

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:45.219
Someone came to the car and threatened him and my mom,

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:48.760
with machine guns,

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.760
to get him out of the car to kidnap him.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.760
We heard a noise.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.760
We all got scared and ran outside,

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.760
and then I remember that my dad was on the ground,

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.060
while a man had shot him.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.740
He was just left there.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.719
I just picked him up in my arms.

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:22.719
He was taken to the hospital,

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:25.719
and a few hours later, he died.

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:31.060
My dad's last words were,

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.060
Jova, protect my daughters.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.060
Take care of my daughters and my little lady,

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:44.879
them and my mom.

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.879
My mom, she was strong.

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.879
She gave us a lot of strength,

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.879
and she carried on with the spiritual routine.

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.879
The same week that my dad died, we had a meeting.

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.879
And my sister, Raquel, had a talk.

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.879
And even though my dad had died the day before,

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:05.879
she gave her part in the meeting the very next day.

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.879
That next week, we had an assembly.

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.879
We didn't miss it.

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:15.879
So we wanted to follow that pattern that my dad had left.

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.879
It was very difficult and complicated.

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:24.879
But Jova always took first place in all the decisions we made.

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.879
They were always made while thinking of Jova

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.879
and the loyalty that my dad always had shown toward him.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.879
I carried on as if he was alive,

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.879
trying to keep all my sisters together.

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.879
And in the truth, you know?

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.879
At first, I prayed to Jova for peace.

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:47.879
Give me the peace that surpasses all understanding.

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.879
And now, when there is something that is harder,

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:51.879
I say to Jova, Jova,

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:54.879
preserve the peace that you have already given me.

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.879
Don't let this trial take away my peace.

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:02.189
And that's when Jova strengthens me.

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:05.189
Well, I'm very fond of my sisters.

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:07.189
I have a lot of respect for them,

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:10.189
because they were like extra mothers to me.

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:12.189
Three of my sisters still live in Colombia,

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:16.189
so we make sure to stay in touch on the phone or on Zoom.

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:20.300
That way they can see how mom is doing.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.300
Some of my relatives who are not witnesses

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.300
wanted to have some of my sisters look with them

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.300
to finish raising them,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.300
but we didn't want our family to be split up

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.300
because that was not my dad's plan.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.300
His plan was for all of us to make it

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.300
into the new world serving Jova together.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.300
All his efforts, all his life,

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.300
and all that he devoted to Jova

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.300
are not going to be in vain

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.300
just because he was no longer with us.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.300
We can't let that all go away.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.300
My dad taught me so many simple things about creation

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.300
and about Jova

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.300
that instilled love for Jova in me.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.300
That was something that I didn't know

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.300
at that time was going to help me to move forward.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.300
But then I always say, wow,

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.300
dad's not here,

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.300
but he left me another father, Jova.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.300
And that's what's helped me to move on.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:24.379
In paradise, what I long for the most is

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:26.379
those last words that he said,

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:29.379
Jova, my wife, my daughters

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:31.379
is to be able to stay to him.

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:33.379
Look, here they are.

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:35.379
We are all here.

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:36.379
We made it.

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:38.379
You did a good job.
