00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:05.870
My life was only work and sleep.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.869
I didn't receive the love a child should have from his family.

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:16.570
Sometimes we spend several days starving with nothing to eat.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.570
We lost everything we had.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.570
The first thing I needed to do was pray to Jehovah.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.570
But the only thing I had time to say was Jehovah, please help me.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.570
Each time he answers my prayer.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.570
Jehovah was holding my hand. I could almost feel him saying, I'm with you.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.570
My love for Jehovah and for my fellow Christians motivated me to take the brothers in.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.570
When I comforted others, it brought me comfort too.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.570
I realized that the love shown to me by the brothers and sisters was an imitation of Jehovah.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.570
Jehovah showed me that love never fails.
