00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:07.139
Our text highlights the fact that we are at war with Satan.

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:18.140
War is defined as a state of hostility accompanied by actions to conquer or to destroy those viewed as the enemy.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:30.140
And the context of our text today, 1 Peter 5.8, talks about the type of enemy we have, a roaring lion seeking to devour someone.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:37.140
And that expression roaring denotes the howl of a beast and feast hunger and fierce hunger.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.140
So we have a real enemy.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.140
And that's why the words of Jesus are so meaningful for us when he gave the model prayer.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:58.140
He said that Matthew 6.13, do not bring us into temptation, but deliver, or the footnote, rescue us from the wicked one.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:09.140
Now, other Bible translations, like the King James Version or the Revised Standard Version, use an expression like deliver us from evil.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.140
Or the contemporary English version says, protect us from evil.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.140
But that doesn't convey the real fierceness of a real enemy. It's more generic.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:27.140
And so Jesus knew the devil was real and he is a real enemy.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.140
And the devil has no remorse. He's fierce. He has no pity.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:39.140
He will take a person and with his traps and lures get him to do something bad in Jehovah's eyes.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:50.140
And then the person is overcome with guilt and then like a fierce enemy, the devil comes along and stomps on him and makes him feel worse because he caved in and sent.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.140
So how do we deal with such a powerful enemy?

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.140
Well, in war, there are soldiers.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.140
So let's use an expression that the Apostle Paul used to describe our situation.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.139
Let's open our Bibles, please, to the book of 2nd Timothy, 2nd Timothy chapter 2.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:17.139
And we're going to read verses 3 and 4 and talk for a few moments about our being soldiers.

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:26.139
2nd Timothy, 2, 3, as I find soldier of Christ Jesus, take your part in suffering adversity.

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:36.139
No man serving as a soldier involves himself in the commercial businesses of life in order to gain the approval of the one who enrolled him as a soldier.

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:44.139
We become soldiers of Christ when we accept Jehovah's arrangements for salvation through Christ Jesus.

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:50.139
And we dedicate our lives to Him unreservedly for our entire life.

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:52.139
We become a soldier.

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:57.139
And like a soldier, we know that it's not going to be easy.

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:00.139
There are going to be hardships and trials.

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:08.139
And yet a fine soldier, his main objective is to stay loyal to his commanding officers and to those who are giving instructions.

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:13.139
And likewise, we know it's not going to be easy, it's not easy.

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:17.139
But we have chosen to become a soldier of Christ.

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:23.139
Now, a soldier, like this loyal one being described, is far different from a mercenary.

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:27.139
A mercenary is one who hires himself out to fight.

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:32.139
But he may not have any devotion really to the cause. He's a hired man.

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:37.139
And he's doing it for the reward only or for something else that he may gain.

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.139
But we're not mercenaries.

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:50.139
We're those with godly devotion, holy devoted to Jehovah and loyal to Christ so that we can be fine soldiers, loyal and true.

00:03:51.139 --> 00:04:00.139
Now, another aspect of soldiers are that they are identified by their distinctive uniforms or their particular fighting equipment.

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:06.139
And that's why it helps to identify who's the friend and who's the foe and middle of the battle.

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:11.139
Their appearance makes that possible.

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:20.139
Well, today there is a clear difference isn't there between the soldiers of Satan and the soldiers of Christ.

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.139
There's great enmity.

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:31.139
But there's a sharp contrast in appearance, in attitude, in disposition, in motivation, in conduct.

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:39.139
And that's why when we think about that, we think about the contrast between the works of the flesh described in Galatians chapter 5.

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.139
And those who have the fruit of God's spirit.

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:50.139
There is such a strong distinction between one serving God and one not serving him.

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:56.139
And that's why too we think about the type of armor we bear.

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:02.139
Ephesians chapter 6 says, put on the complete suit of armor from God.

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.139
So our very armor is from God.

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:13.139
We do not use the tactics and the methods of the devil, but we are clearly identified as a soldier of Christ.

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.139
And there can be no great area here.

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.139
We're either on one side or the other, correct?

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:28.139
For example, suppose that you're a soldier and you're on guard duty and it's evening and you see someone approaching and you cry out,

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:34.139
halt, who goes there, friend or foe, and you hear back, I'm both.

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:39.300
There's an enemy.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.300
You can't be on both sides.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.300
Now what is another aspect of being a good soldier in this fight?

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.300
Let's open our Bibles to Philippians chapter 1.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.300
Philippians chapter 1.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:06:00.300
And we get to the concept of unity and working closely together in peace because an army needs to be unified.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.300
Philippians chapter 1 verse 27 says,

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:12.300
only behave in a manner worthy of the good news about the Christ so that whether I come and see you or I am absent,

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:22.300
I may hear about you and learn that you're standing firm in one spirit with one soul and the footnote are with one accord,

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.870
striving side by side for the faith of the good news.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:35.870
And in no way, being frightened by your opponents, this very thing is a proof of destruction for them,

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.870
but a salvation for you, and this is from God.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.870
Well, we have this matter of unity, don't we?

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.870
Shoulder to shoulder side by side.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:52.870
And yet, one of the tactics of the devil is to get us divided

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:57.870
and disjointed and fighting among ourselves.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.870
To turn the enemy on itself is a very effective war strategy.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.870
Even Jehovah used that.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:05.870
Remember against his enemies?

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.870
In 2 Chronicles chapter 20 verses 20 through 23,

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:15.870
there was the attack of Ammon Moab in the mountainous region of Seer against Judah.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.870
And what did Jehovah do?

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:23.870
He confused them, they struck down each other, they to help destroy one another.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.870
And the devil, in a very sinister way, uses that same approach.

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:29.870
How?

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:38.870
Well, if we can get us to not get along with each other and turn on one another, then that's a very effective tactic.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:46.870
In fact, we remember the expression in Ephesians chapter 4 verses 26 and 27 about getting along,

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:53.870
be wrathful, but do not sin, do not let the sun set while you're still angry,

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.870
do not give the devil an opportunity.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:02.870
So when he sees discord and disunity, he can really amplify that.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:06.870
So we have to remember who are our real enemies.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:11.870
Now, our brothers may disappoint us, they may frustrate us, they may hurt us at times,

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.870
do their imperfections, but they're not the enemy.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:18.870
The devil and his hordes, those are the enemies.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:26.870
So we don't get to fighting with the wrong person, we keep in mind our brothers or with us.

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:32.870
And in this connection, we just read in that scripture in Philippians that talked about not being afraid.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:39.870
And do you remember something about being afraid when it related to a soldier in Israel's army?

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.870
Deuteronomy chapter 20 verse 8 says,

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:48.870
the officers should also ask the people who is fearful and faint-hearted.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:55.870
He should return to his house so that he may not cause his brothers to lose heart as he has.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:58.870
Well, we do have an effect on each other.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:04.870
Can you imagine being in Joshua's army getting ready to battle into your left as a soldier?

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:08.870
And as you're about ready to leave for battle, he says to you, we're going to die.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:13.870
We're not going to come back, say goodbye to your family, this is it.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:18.870
Or he may say, I'm not sure Joshua has Jehovah's backing like Moses did.

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.870
All of that would be terrible.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:26.870
And so anyone in that category was to go home because they do have an effect on others.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:31.870
How grateful though we are that we have positive courageous brothers who trust in Jehovah.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:38.870
Examples in the Bible, but also modern day examples just like our brothers in Russia.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:44.870
Well, as soldiers in this battle, we're not ignorant of Satan's designs.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:49.870
And yet he studies us very carefully and he knows our weaknesses.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:56.870
The September 1st, 1988 watchtower had an article stand firm against Satan's machinations.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:00.870
And in that it said, the devil knows what our weaknesses are.

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:02.870
But do we?

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:08.870
If we don't identify them and then correct them, we will be defenseless at times.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:14.870
But it takes honesty and humility and an earnest desire to address that which is bad.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:17.870
Otherwise, we become a victim.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.870
So we need to ask, what are my weaknesses?

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.870
Do I identify them? Do I work with them?

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:26.870
And yet would Jehovah's help?

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.870
We can come off victorious in this battle.

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.870
1 Peter 510 says that Jehovah will finish our training.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.870
He will make us firm. He will make us strong.

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:38.870
So would Jehovah's help? We can succeed.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:46.870
So maybe all continue as fine soldiers of Christ trusting in Jehovah and when the battle against the enemy, the devil.
