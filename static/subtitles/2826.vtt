00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:36.380
The time now came for Elizabeth to give birth and she gave birth to a son and the neighbors and her relatives

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:54.299
heard that Jehovah had magnified his mercy to her and they rejoiced with her on the eighth day

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:17.200
They came to circumcise the young child and they were going to name him after his father Zechariah

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:20.019
No

00:01:20.019 --> 00:01:22.019
But he will be called John

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:25.859
Not one of your relatives is called by this name

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:52.930
Then they asked his father by signs what he wanted him to be called so he asked for a tablet and wrote

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.890
John is his name

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:59.689
At this they were all amazed

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:10.909
instantly

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:19.289
His mouth was opened and his tongue was set free John

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:22.289
And he began to speak

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:24.289
John is his name

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.530
praising God

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.530
Praise to Jehovah

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:48.560
And fear fell upon all those living in their neighborhood and

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:56.680
All these things began to be talked about in the whole mountainous country of Judea and

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.729
All who heard noticed it in their hearts saying

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:05.650
What will this young child turn out to be?

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:20.979
For the hand of Jehovah was indeed with him then

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:36.330
Zechariah his father was filled with holy spirit and he prophesied

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:44.500
Let Jehovah be praised the God of Israel

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.580
Because he has turned his attention to his people and has brought them deliverance

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.979
And he has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of David his servant

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:08.099
Just as he had spoken through the mouth of his holy prophets from evolved of a salvation from our enemies

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.219
And from the hand of all those hating us

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:19.500
To show mercy in connection with our forefathers and to call to mind his holy covenant

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.579
the oath

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:29.819
That he swore to Abraham our forefather to grant us

00:04:31.579 --> 00:04:34.060
After we have been rescued from the hands of enemies

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:36.819
the privilege of

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:43.170
Fearlessly rendering sacred service to him with loyalty and

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.810
Righteousness before him

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.810
All our days

00:04:49.810 --> 00:05:17.339
That as for you young child

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.500
You will be called a prophet of the most high

00:05:23.019 --> 00:05:27.350
where you will go ahead of Jehovah

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:31.560
to prepare his ways

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.100
To give knowledge of salvation to his people

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:40.139
By forgiveness of their sins

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:58.300
Because of the tender compassion of our God with this compassion a daybreak will visit us from on high

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:09.889
To give light to those sitting in darkness and death shadow and to guide our feet

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:36.730
In the way of peace and the young child grew up and

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.490
became strong in spirit

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:46.769
And he continued in the desert until the day he showed himself openly to Israel
