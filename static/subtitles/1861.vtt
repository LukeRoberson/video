00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:09.980
In 2017, I was the treasurer for a prestigious bank in Nicaragua and I was the father of a one-year-old son.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.320
We were very happy, but then I lost my job.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.320
So I said, I have the experience and Jehovah will help me find another job.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.320
Something similar and I kept looking for jobs but doors kept closing.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:39.320
I felt very tense, it made me feel very useless, like I can't even provide for my family.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.390
It was something very difficult for me.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:54.390
Proverbs 17 and 17 says, a true friend shows love at all times and is a brother who is born for times of distress.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.740
And I have seen this come true in my life.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:07.739
When I lost my job at the bank, well I felt very depressed, troubled, tense, and I have a good friend that I can talk to.

00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:16.739
And when I told him how I was feeling, he told me, look Miguel, don't look for the same line of work.

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:20.739
Maybe what you need to do is make a change in your life.

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:31.739
Why don't you find some simple work outside of an office for a time that can help you to keep your eye simple and allow you to provide for your family?

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:43.459
I watched my wife make bread for our family and one day I told her, I'm going to make that bread, but not for our family.

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:45.459
I'm going to make it to sell.

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:49.459
So she told me, no, are you crazy?

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:58.459
It was a big change right from having a position at a bank and handling a lot of money to selling on the street.

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:09.460
So I told her, look, I'm going to put this hat on and I put like a chef's hat on and I told her, I'll be back in less than an hour.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.460
Whether I sell or not, and that's what happened.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.460
And to her surprise, I came back without any bread.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:22.460
So when I got ready to leave the second time to sell, she said, okay, go, but leave the hat here.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:45.400
I also started to iron clothes for people in their homes.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.400
And it looks strange because normally where we live, that type of work is done by a woman.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.400
But for a man to go and iron clothes at someone's home, you don't see that.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.400
But I didn't want to just sit back with my arms crossed and see what would happen.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.400
No, I had to put my hands to work to earn a living for my family.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.509
So I would preach one day and the next day I would iron clothes.

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:14.509
The next day I would preach and the day after that I would go out and sell bread.

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:19.509
So my mind was always occupied on doing something, either for the kingdom or my family.

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:20.509
And that helped me a lot.

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:23.979
Now I have a stable job.

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:25.979
I work at a hardware store.

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:29.300
Man, I feel that peace.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.300
The universities have made me stronger.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.300
And overall, I have a much closer relationship with Jehovah.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.300
But I'm still making bread.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.300
And at home, yeah, I'm the one who iron's the clothes.
