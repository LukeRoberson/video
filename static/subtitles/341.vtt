00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:08.980
As has been mentioned, our scripture for today, the Apostle Paul talks about this inner struggle,

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.980
this inner war, really, that is going on inside every one of us.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:22.980
It's the war between God's law and our mind and sin's law in our flesh.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.980
And it's interesting the expression law in both cases is appropriate because a law

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.979
the purpose is to legislate action or conduct.

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:39.979
And of course, God's law in our mind is trying to legislate that we act according to Jehovah's thinking.

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:46.979
But of course, sin's law in our flesh is trying to dictate that we act according to Satan's thinking,

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:48.979
selfishly, fleshly.

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:51.979
And it is an intense war.

00:00:52.979 --> 00:01:01.979
These two laws are warring, trying to overpower each other and dominate and control how we act.

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.980
And only if we fight hard will we win the war.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.980
Now the Apostle Paul fought hard, didn't he?

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.980
It's true he lost some battles along the way, but he won the war, didn't he?

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:20.980
And he's now an immortal spirit creature in the heavens, so we want to imitate Paul.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.980
And now what can help us win this war?

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.980
Well, let's develop an illustration they can help us, hopefully appreciate what can help us to win the war.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.980
We want to illustrate with two opposing armies.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.980
And if we think about it, that's what we have inside of us, don't we?

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.980
We have two opposing armies fighting each other in effect.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.980
One is a good army, one is a very bad army.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:53.980
Now what can we do to help the good army, God's law in our mind, to dominate over the other army?

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.980
Well, let's talk about two factors that are involved.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.980
One food, second attitude.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:07.980
Now taking first food, if one army is well fed and the other is starved,

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.979
now which one do you think is going to win? Well, the answer is obvious, isn't it?

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.979
Makes me think of the saying that an army marches on its stomach.

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:17.979
Well, how do we feed the good army?

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:22.979
Jesus said in Matthew 4, 4, man must live, not on bread alone,

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:26.979
but on every word that comes from Jehovah's mouth.

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:30.979
For Speeder 2, 2 talks about the milk of the word.

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:36.979
Hebrews 5, 14 talks about the solid food, deeper truths of God's word.

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:43.979
Matthew 24, 45, Jesus talks about feeding his disciples through the faithful slave.

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:45.979
So how do we feed the good army?

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:50.979
Well, we consistently, diligently consume the spiritual food,

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:56.979
and thereby keep the law of God in our mind well nourished, strong and healthy.

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:59.979
But now how do we starve the bad army?

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:04.979
Well, for one thing, we refuse to dwell on the immoral thinking

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:07.979
that Satan's world promotes.

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:10.979
We wouldn't even think of looking at pornography.

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:17.979
If we did that, I'd be like feeding a steak dinner to the bad army.

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:23.979
But even much more than that, if an immoral thought enters our mind, we push it out.

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:26.979
We pray to Jehovah, we get the Bible out, start reading it,

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:29.979
somehow we switch our mind onto something wholesome.

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:33.979
We do our best, as brought out to 2 Corinthians 10-5,

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:40.979
to bring every thought into captivity and make it obedient to the Christ.

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:47.979
We also refuse to feed our mind materialistic and other worldly thinking that Satan's world promotes.

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:53.979
And when we think about this matter of feeding the good army, starving the bad army,

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:57.979
it makes me think of the old Cherokee Indian legend.

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:00.979
You might have heard of this, according to one reference book,

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:03.979
a grandfather was talking to his grandson.

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:09.979
And he talked about how he had inside him two wolves fighting intensely each other.

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:12.979
One very good wolf, one a very bad wolf.

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:15.979
The grandson naturally wanted to know what which one's going to win.

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:19.980
Well, the grandfather explained the one I feed.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.980
And it's really true of us.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.980
But now let's get this second factor, attitude.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.980
If one army has a positive determined attitude,

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.980
and the other has a hopeless demoralized attitude,

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.980
which one is likely to win?

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.980
Well, again, the answer is pretty clear.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.980
Well, how do we maintain a positive determined attitude in the figurative good army

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:43.980
inside of us?

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.980
Open up to 2 Corinthians 4, please.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.980
And here's a key factor.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.980
No matter what trials test tribulations come our way, we don't give up.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.980
We don't lose our hope, we keep our eyes on the prize.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.980
Now, notice how it's expressed here.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.980
2 Corinthians chapter 4, beginning in verse 16,

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:11.980
it says, therefore, we do not give up.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.980
But even if the man we are outside is wasting away,

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.980
certainly the man we are inside is being renewed from day to day.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.980
For though the tribulation is momentary and light,

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:31.980
it works out for us a glory that is of more and more surpassing greatness

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.980
and is everlasting.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.980
While we keep our eyes not on the things seen,

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.980
but on the things unseen, for the things seen or temporary,

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.980
but the things unseen are everlasting.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.980
And I really like that thought that any trial, no matter how intense it is,

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:55.980
is only momentary and it's only light, relatively speaking.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.980
It's momentary when you think of the comparison of eternal blessings

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.980
in Jehovah's New World.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.980
It's light compared to the weightiness, the greatness of the blessings

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.980
of Jehovah's New World.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:14.980
Can you imagine being able to trade a moment of pain for an eternity of pleasure,

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.980
an ounce of misery for tons of happiness?

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.980
And if you think about it, we're able to make that exchange.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.980
See, if we don't give up, no matter what trial comes our way.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:32.980
But now, how do we infuse a hopeless demoralized attitude into the bad army?

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.980
Sands law in our flesh.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:41.980
Well, for one thing, we always remember that if we were to give in to Sands law

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.980
and pursue a life of sin, and that's just a terrible thought to even think about,

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.980
but if we did that, it would be a loose, loose proposition, wouldn't it?

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:56.980
In fact, we would lose big time now, reaping the horrible consequences

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.980
physically, mentally, emotionally of Sands.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.980
We would lose even bigger in the future, totally missing out on what Jehovah has in store

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.980
for those who love him.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:08.980
So we remember that.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.980
And we remember scriptures such as Psalm 37, 38.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.980
All the transgressors will be destroyed.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.980
The future of wicked people will be cut off, see.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:25.980
We remember that Satan and his followers are headed for the Lake of Fire.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.980
And we don't want to join them.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.980
See, our destination is the New World. Is it not the Lake of Fire?

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:38.980
So we don't even slightly envy the wicked, unlike Asaph, at one point in his life,

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:39.980
he began to envy them.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:40.980
We don't envy them.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.980
We feel sorry for them, don't we?

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:50.980
We certainly infuse this hopeless attitude into the bad army that to pursue a course of sin

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.980
would be very foolish.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:57.980
Well, there we have two factors involved, food and attitude.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:02.980
Now, if we had time, we could discuss training, equipment.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.980
But we're going to leave that for you.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.980
Now, you can do that in your family worship, your personal study.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:08.980
And I think you'll find it interesting.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:13.980
If you pursue just like we did with food and attitude, equipment and training.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:18.980
But the point is, as long as we have this inner struggle inside us,

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:20.980
it's really good.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:21.980
It means we haven't lost.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.980
See, we're still fighting.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:29.980
And even though we lose a battle or two along the way, we'll win the war.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.980
If we don't give up, we don't lose hope.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.980
We don't surrender.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.980
So don't ever put up the white flag.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.980
Don't ever call it truce.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:42.980
Continue to fight until that wonderful day.

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:44.980
That inner struggle will be gone.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:45.980
It will be perfect.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.980
And God's law in our mind will completely dominate.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:56.980
And like Jehovah and Jesus, just naturally our natural inclination will be to do what is right.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:01.980
But until then, let us fight with all our might.
