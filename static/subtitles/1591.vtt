WEBVTT

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.169
Hey Steve, yeah, I'm sorry. I was late to the meeting I

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:21.280
Should have been there to help out with my assignment. Yeah, we got delayed

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:29.329
Let's go kids

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:37.380
Yeah, family's fine

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:46.340
Everybody's adjusting really well anyone see my glasses

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:59.020
Anyone I mean we might be a little out of sync, but I don't know

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:09.109
Every family has their issues, right? You got on sign up?

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.180
Hey, well, thanks for understanding

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.340
All right

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:54.890
Okay, take care. All right, bye-bye. I don't know

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.129
What do you think? We all have to work on it. I know I need to

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.170
Why don't we approach it that way with the kids just be open with them?

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.009
That sounds like a good idea

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.930
Okay, so Irene and I have been talking about

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.280
communication

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.280
And our family

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.319
We want to talk about our phones and other devices

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:29.319
You're not talking about me are you you can't I know that we know be more balanced, but you can't take them away

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:35.080
I haven't done anything bad. I have responsibilities. You're always on your phone, too. That's true. It's okay

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.639
Let's just talk about it

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.370
All right, so

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.090
Can you read Ephesians 5 15 and 16 for us, please?

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.500
So keep strict watch that how you walk is not as unwise, but as wise persons

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:58.539
Making the best use of your time

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.650
Because the days are wicked

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.650
so

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.449
How do you think we're doing with our phones and other devices?

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:18.150
It isn't that what you're doing on your devices is wrong

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:20.949
exactly, but

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:23.669
Could it be taking time away from more important things

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:31.930
Like talking to each other and in that way affecting even how we're talking to each other

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.819
Yeah, I think it'd be smart to have some boundaries then

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:56.520
Yeah, okay, okay

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.719
Okay

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:03.689
Let's talk about how we can do that

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:05.370
Hey, I love you

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.780
Hey

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.860
Evidently I haven't figured out how to talk to her about her close yet. I need your help

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:21.110
I got this one

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.310
I know

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.550
But it's all about good spiritual judgment

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:29.750
Do you think that these trends reflect Jehovah's view of respectable dress?

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.620
I know that you'll do the right thing

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:49.660
While we're all here, I know we all have different views on punctuality

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.980
But I really need your help so I can take care of some of my responsibilities

00:04:57.899 --> 00:05:01.620
You think we can meet in the middle?

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.620
Yeah, all right

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.620
Great
