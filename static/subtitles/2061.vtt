00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:08.800
Russian authorities have rated over 1,600 homes of Jehovah's Witnesses since 2017.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:15.560
In the early morning hours of October 4, 2021, dozens of low-enforcement officers burst

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.000
into homes of Jehovah's Witnesses in the city of Irkutsk, Siberia.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.480
Several were beaten and humiliated.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.199
At 6.15 a.m., they smashed the window and knocked it out.

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.399
My husband thought Berglis had broken in.

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.000
He went to check the window and was immediately thrown down to the floor, which was covered

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.159
with glass.

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:42.000
His feet, elbows and hands were bloodied.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.719
My wife and I were walking up by persistent ringing of our doorbell.

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:52.000
I remember opening the door, then suddenly I was forced to the floor.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.600
I felt that my front tooth had been partially broken off.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.759
I heard the officer starting to beat him.

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:04.200
My wife was crying and shouting so that they would stop beating me.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.560
They broke entire apartment through the window.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.519
They started shouting at me to lie face down on the floor.

00:01:11.519 --> 00:01:13.719
I replied, what's happening?

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:15.680
I've got a small child here.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.599
Why have you broken in like this?

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:19.599
My child was terrified.

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:24.840
In some cases, the officers resorted to torture to try to force the witnesses to incriminate

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.280
themselves or to divulge personal information.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.719
The rest of the bar of home, officers stripped on a toilet naked and forced him to lie

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:35.159
on the floor.

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.719
I tried to raise my head.

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:38.560
They hit me in the face.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.959
They kicked me in the area of my kidneys and my head.

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:46.719
And then masked man came up behind me and lifted me up.

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:52.760
They twisted my arms like this and started hoisting me up from the ground.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.040
It was incredibly painful.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:02.079
One sat on my leg and the other tried to torture me by trying to force a glass bottle into

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:03.239
my buttocks.

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:06.680
They finally left me for a while just lying naked on the floor.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.959
The door was open.

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:09.840
It was freezing cold.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.039
After the raids, seven other Jehovah's Witnesses, Sergei Kastyev, Nikolai Martinov, Yaroslav

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:21.199
Kalian, Mikhail Moish, Alexey Solnichnyev, Sergei Vasilyev and Andrei Talmachov were detained

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:23.680
and sent to a temporary holding cell.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.360
In the following day, a court hearing took place to decide what restrictive measures would

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.360
be imposed on the man.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.159
Around 300 friends turned up at the courthouse to show support for the man.

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:43.400
I am very grateful to the brothers and sisters who stood outside the court in the cold

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.039
for 12 hours, even with children, in order to support brothers who were in the court

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:53.639
while their judges were deciding on the restrictive measures.

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.840
It was something special.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.879
I immediately felt that we are part of a brotherhood.

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:05.360
It was so obvious that the words of the friends came from the depths of their hearts and that

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.319
they were right there with us.

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.199
The judges ruled to send six men to a pre-trial detention center.

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:15.800
The violent raids in Irkutsk tested the faith of the local Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.280
However, they firmly believe that what took place has drawn them closer together and strengthened

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.280
their faith.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.840
And I would read about what happened in other cities.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.599
I often wondered how I would react in this situation.

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.400
Now it has happened to me, and I have seen how Jehovah has really supported me.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.439
I felt that there were angels with us because of the way we endured throughout the whole

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:38.439
search.

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:41.280
I know it was only possible with Jehovah.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.280
I was completely calm and felt total in appease during the search.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.639
After this experience, I am certain that any brother or sister who serves Jehovah today

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:57.400
and does so sincerely and wholeheartedly can endure no matter what trials he faces in

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.400
life.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.240
That's for sure.
