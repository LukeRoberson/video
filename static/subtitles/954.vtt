WEBVTT

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:07.440
On behalf of the governing body, I can say that we really appreciate your attending this

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.539
pursue peace convention.

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:17.320
Speaking of peace, we love the serene setting here at our World Headquarters on Blue Lake

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.320
in New York State.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.000
At times, the water is as smooth as a mirror.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.960
We occasionally see eagles and hawks fly by, and in the fall of the year when the leaves

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.759
change colors, the forest can look spectacular.

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:40.079
More important than this tranquil setting, though, is the abundant peace that Jehovah has

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.159
given to his organization.

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:49.920
We can say this because of the peace and harmony that unite us, no matter what our nationality,

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.719
language, race, tribe, or social background is.

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:02.200
This is truly spectacular, especially when we consider all the turmoil in the world,

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.840
and how divided people are politically, socially, and religiously.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.079
However, we cannot take our beautiful peace for granted.

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:16.200
It's not maintained automatically.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.760
Each of us personally must pursue peace in order to have God's approval.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.879
Jehovah certainly wants his worshipers to enjoy lasting peace.

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:29.159
That was true in ancient times.

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:36.439
God told Moses to have the priests in Israel bless the people with very reassuring words.

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:44.319
Notice these words that we find at Numbers 6, verses 24 through 26, and hear what the

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.760
priests were to say to the people.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.560
May Jehovah bless you and safeguard you.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.760
May Jehovah make his face shine upon you and may he favor you.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.120
May Jehovah lift up his face toward you and grant you peace.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:08.439
The next verse states, and they must place my name upon the people of Israel that I may

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:10.680
bless them.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.840
Jehovah has placed his name on us too, and he is richly blessing us.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.439
Let's consider what this convention program is going to cover, so that we'll know how

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:25.919
we can continue to enjoy God's blessing of peace.

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:31.439
First, we'll consider how to be at peace with God.

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:37.439
Our greatest peace comes from having a personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:44.000
Making him our best friend, benefits us, and leads to peace in every other aspect of

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.719
our life.

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:50.159
How can we reach out for a close relationship with God?

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.840
We need more than a superficial knowledge of him.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.240
We need to get to know Jehovah as a person and admire his qualities and ways.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.919
Then we can love what he loves and hate what he hates.

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:12.199
During this program, listen for details about Jehovah that will draw you ever closer to

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:13.800
him.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.639
Second, we'll consider how to be at peace with others.

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:22.879
Our home should be havens for peace for our families.

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.960
This means more than the absence of arguing.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.240
It involves putting the interests of our family members ahead of our own.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:37.120
As we'll learn from this program, that includes showing love and respect to one another, working

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:44.520
as a team, improving family communication, and worshipping Jehovah together.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:52.439
Third, we'll consider how to be at peace despite trials and troublesome world conditions.

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:59.319
During this convention, we're going to tour the world to see how, despite opposition,

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:07.080
illness, economic problems, and natural disasters, our brothers really care for one another.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:14.599
How they receive help from Jehovah's organization and how they continue their spiritual activity.

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:20.560
No matter what may threaten our lives or livelihood, we can be confident that Jehovah can help

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.120
us get through it and retain our peace of mind and heart.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.360
Fourth, we'll consider how to enjoy peace eternally.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:38.680
Once God's kingdom has lifted mankind to perfection, we'll no longer have to pursue peace.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:45.959
As Psalm 72 verse 7 promises, the righteous will flourish, and peace will abound until

00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:48.759
the moon is no more.

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:53.079
In other words, there will be peace forever.

00:04:53.079 --> 00:04:59.120
This program will help us to anticipate future blessings from Jehovah.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.439
When you see why pursue peace was well-chosen as the theme for this year's convention,

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:11.279
to pursue something means to chase it in order to capture it.

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:17.120
Because of the influence of Satan, his wicked world, and our own imperfections, peace is

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.120
constantly trying to elude us.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.639
Therefore, we have to chase after it to capture it in our lives.

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:29.160
This convention program will help us do that.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.839
May the God of peace be with all of you now and forever.

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:42.279
That's the heartfelt wish of all of us on the governing body because we love you dearly.

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:45.879
Please enjoy the entire convention program.
