00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:22.699
Finding a way to get everybody five people at the same time to have a whole evening together.

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.699
It can be a challenge.

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:29.699
I wondered whether I would be able to make our family worship interesting and beneficial.

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.659
I was not very confident.

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:37.659
A challenge for me is my own attitude toward family worship.

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:41.659
I would hang out with my friends from the congregation.

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:44.659
Children like it when you are interested in them.

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:46.659
Spend time with them.

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:51.539
But you don't always have the time and energy needed.

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.539
I had to provide financially for the family.

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:58.539
I was always tired and worn out.

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:03.789
So it was very hard to have family worship regularly.

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:06.790
Kenzie of course is special needs.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:13.790
And she has her challenges and there's times when it just doesn't work.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.790
Sometimes my dad would make us attend family worship when I actually want to go to bed.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.790
It is quite annoying.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.790
That's an honest reply.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.790
We have three different age groups.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.790
We have a 14-ager, we have a pre-teen, and we have a son who is very active, hyper.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.790
My husband not being a worshiper of Jehovah.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.549
Might have different plans for the family.

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.549
When family worship arrangement was introduced,

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.549
it became part of our service of Jehovah.

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.549
We never miss a congregation meeting.

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.549
So why should we miss the family worship?

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.549
Whether I'm tired or not, the consistency of having family worship is very important.

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.549
It really requires discipline because sometimes there's things that we want to do.

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.549
And we just know, well, family studies is what's most important, so we have to give that up.

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:12.550
My friends and the brothers and the congregation often call me

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.550
to exercise or play sports.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.550
Since family worship day doesn't change each week,

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.699
it becomes easier to turn them down.

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:34.080
I've said to the girls, let's try to push each other.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.080
Let's try to encourage each other because it's not easy.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.080
I feel it has to start with me making that time and effort to leave work on time

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.080
in order to be able to honor our family worship.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.080
I became confident that this can really be successful.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.080
I think the most important is the love we have with Jehovah

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.080
that keeps us going.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.080
I think that's our motivation.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.080
We are determined to teach you as much as we possibly can

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:11.080
and that you'll possibly understand so that the truth will mean everything to her too.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.080
Well, gateby.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.080
Well, gateby.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.419
We're a family and things pop up.

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:23.419
Something can come up unexpectedly.

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:28.419
So, when we need to cover it or the angles.

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:30.419
We make it relaxing.

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:35.419
The children look forward to getting cake or fruit or something else

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:38.419
so that they doesn't get strict and reach it.

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:41.419
We have to know when to be flexible.

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:46.419
When you have children, we feel that you have to make small

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:51.419
short sessions so that they can concentrate on the subject being discussed.

00:03:51.419 --> 00:04:00.419
I think, God, older, we had to change their methods.

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:03.419
At times, we invite brothers and their congregation.

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:10.419
We might get the kids to organize some questions so they can interview the brother or sister

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:13.419
that's coming over, especially to their new in the congregation.

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:17.420
So, sometimes family worship might be about issues that our family is facing.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.420
Sometimes it might be about things in the ministry that we want to try and accomplish.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.420
Sometimes it might be about games.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.420
So, we've stretched out all over the floor and you know,

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.420
done all sorts of wonderful things for family worship because it keeps people engaged.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.750
It's all about asking the family what they like to talk about.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.750
If a family is involved, it is a family worship.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.750
Rather than dad or myself sitting at the agenda for family worship,

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.750
well, then it'll be a dad's family worship, not the whole family.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.750
But if we get the feedback from the whole family, from everyone, everyone gets to put in ideas,

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.750
then we just plan that accordingly.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.750
The reality of what we need now for relevance is we need to make sure that they're grounded in their faith and belief.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:05.750
At every family study, we always try to focus on the kids' spiritual goals.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.750
Once the kid at school came and asked me if I could play for the football team.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.750
And I thought it was a good idea.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.750
So I went to dad and asked him.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.750
And then he said, oh, why don't we try something called role reversals?

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.750
I would play the dad. He would play the side.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.750
In my case, the biggest pressure that I have to face is dating in school.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.540
And family worship helps me a lot.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:34.540
Instead of allowing my problems and negative emotions to faster within me,

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.540
I shared this feelings with my family during family worship.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.540
Mom was very understanding, and she made an effort to come up with themes

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.540
during family worship to address those issues.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.540
We decided to make a scroll of the book of Isaiah.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:06:01.540
It really helps me to realize that Jehovah's organization makes it easier for us to find the scriptures that we're looking for,

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.540
and not to make it so complicated like in Jesus' days.

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:14.540
But for me, the best thing is to have an opportunity to express myself.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:20.459
It's good sometimes to break it up a bit so it's not always like dad talking.

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:27.800
When I see how happy all the family members are after our family worship,

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:33.800
I would silently thank Jehovah for helping me fulfill my responsibility as the head of the household.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.800
Our children have learned to be more outgoing and participate more into meetings.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:46.870
It was Jehovah's way of telling me, you're not alone.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:51.870
You have these precious children with you.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:58.759
It's just that I wasn't paying enough attention to them.

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:02.759
Open with prayer, and then right after that, it's just amazing. It's really fun.

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:06.759
So getting there is the hard part, but once we get into it, that's when it starts.

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:09.759
That's when it starts having fun.

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:14.759
The family worship has been protecting my family,

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:20.759
and it has been preparing my family for the difficulties we face.

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:26.759
We actually are more open with each other now than we ever were before,

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:31.759
and we can discuss just about anything and everything, which is actually good.

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:41.319
Family worship made me realize how happy I am to have Jehovah as my God,

00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:45.319
and that I have many reasons to be happy.

00:07:45.319 --> 00:07:49.319
It feels like I can just let go of what was making me sad,

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:53.319
what was making me a bit angry, and I can just be like,

00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:58.319
it's fine because I know everything will be okay, and Jehovah's blessed our evening.
