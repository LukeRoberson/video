00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:06.540
and introduction to first Samuel.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.539
In the original Hebrew canon, first and second Samuel were one volume.

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:18.850
The writing is attributed to the prophet's Samuel, Gad, and Nathan,

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.850
Samuel penning the first 24 chapters.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.129
First Samuel covers a period of just over 100 years

00:00:27.129 --> 00:00:35.130
from about 1180 to 1078 BCE, roughly when the writing was completed.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.130
The book is largely about four leaders in Israel.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:46.130
High Priest Eli, the prophet Samuel, King Saul, and David.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:55.229
In chapter 1, a barren woman named Hannah begs Jehovah for a son,

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:59.229
promising to devote him to God's service.

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:02.229
God answers her prayer.

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:09.230
When her child Samuel was weaned, she places him in the care of high priest Eli in Shiloh.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:17.230
In chapter 3, Jehovah tells young Samuel to deliver a judgment message against Eli's house

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.230
because he has failed to rebuke his wicked sons.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:27.230
In chapter 4, Philistines capture the ark of the covenant at Israel's army camp

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.230
and slay Eli's two sons, Hoffnai and Phineas.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:39.230
When 98-year-old Eli hears the news, he falls backward and dies.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.230
In chapters 5-7, the Philistines return the ark to Israel

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.230
after suffering a series of heavy punishments from Jehovah.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:55.609
In the next chapter, the Israel lights faithlessly demand a king.

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:04.609
In chapter 9, Jehovah tells Samuel to anoint Saul of the tribe of Benjamin as leader of Israel.

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:12.610
Chapter 11 shows that Saul starts out well, but before long he becomes disobedient.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:19.610
In chapter 13, he presumptuously offers up a burnt sacrifice.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:26.610
In chapter 15, he defeats the Amalekites, but disobediently spares king Agag

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.610
and the best of the herd and the flock.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.610
To obey is better than a sacrifice, Samuel says.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.610
He then tells Saul that God has rejected him from being king.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:48.610
In chapter 16, Samuel anoints David, a son of Jesse, to be the next king.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:58.610
In the next chapter, David, with just a sling and a stone, kills the giant Goliath, a champion of the Philistines.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:06.610
Chapter 18 records the start of a lifelong friendship between David and Saul's son Jonathan.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:13.889
Seeing David's courage, Saul puts him in charge of the fighting men.

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:23.889
David's campaigns are so successful that he receives more praise than Saul, who becomes filled with murderous envy.

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:33.969
In chapter 19, David flees for his life, remaining effugitive until Saul's death.

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:35.969
Did you know?

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:40.969
First Samuel has valuable lessons about faith and obedience.

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:45.969
Eli and Saul disobeyed Jehovah and came to a tragic end.

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:54.969
Samuel and David, however, served God faithfully from their youth, thus enjoying his blessing throughout their lives.

00:03:54.969 --> 00:04:08.340
In chapter 24 and 26, David has opportunities to kill Saul, but he refuses to harm Jehovah's anointed.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:16.339
In chapter 25, Samuel dies and all Israel mourns.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:27.339
David, now in the wilderness of Perran, sends ten of his young men to a wealthy sheep owner called Naible to ask for provisions.

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:34.339
When Naible insolently refuses to help, David prepares to take revenge.

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:43.339
However, Naible's wife Abigail quickly goes to David with provisions and avert's tragedy.

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:57.220
In chapter 31, first Samuel closes with the death of Saul and three of his sons, who are buried under a tamerisk tree in J. Beshgiliad.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:04.220
As you read first Samuel, note how Eli and Saul brought disgrace upon themselves.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.220
See why Jehovah loved Samuel and David.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:17.220
And read how God built for David a lasting house, which eventually led to the Messiah, the King of God's Kingdom.
