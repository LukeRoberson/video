00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:09.509
Jehovah is the only true God, the sovereign of the universe.

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:15.949
Some wicked spirits and even humans have deceitfully pretended to be gods.

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:21.109
Other gods are nothing more than figments of human imagination.

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.910
Those who put their trust in false gods are sure to be disappointed.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.670
False gods are incapable of blessing or protecting their worshipers.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:39.829
96.5 says, all the gods of the peoples are worthless gods.

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:46.149
In contrast, the true God Jehovah lovingly cares for his loyal worshipers and will never

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.310
forsake them.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:54.429
In Bible times, there were some among Jehovah's people who deceived themselves into thinking

00:00:54.429 --> 00:01:00.189
that they could worship false gods without losing Jehovah's favor.

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:08.909
For example, in Elijah's day, King Ahab married Jezebel and joined her in Bale worship.

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.750
Many Israelites followed King Ahab, giving lips service to Jehovah while at the same time

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.469
venerating the false God Bale.

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:25.510
The following audio drama will take us back to the days of the Prophet Elijah in the

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.069
10th century BCE.

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:34.430
We will examine how Jehovah proved to be the only true God.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.310
We will also see how we can avoid putting trust in false gods today.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:47.030
As we review the events that took place in Elijah's day, look for the answers to the following

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.030
questions.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.030
1.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:56.310
Why is it foolish to give our devotion to anything or anyone other than Jehovah?

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.069
2.

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:03.269
What could interfere with our giving exclusive devotion to Jehovah?

00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:04.269
3.

00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:10.030
How does Jehovah make himself known to us as individuals?

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:17.830
While listening to the recording, use your imagination to picture the various characters,

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.949
such as Pineless and hypocritical King Ahab.

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:32.550
People and domineering Queen Jezebel and the humble and loyal Prophet Elijah.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:41.150
Visualize the land of Israel, its valleys, ravines and hills, all scorched by severe drought.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.909
As you listen to the voices and sounds, remember that although these words were spoken thousands

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:54.310
of years ago, they were actual conversations between real people like us.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.310
1.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:04.389
Turn in your Bible to 1 Kings 1629-33.

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:10.830
This account begins by telling us about Wicked King Ahab.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.870
Can I see how this Bible account comes to life?

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.110
As we listen to the audio drama, Jehovah is the only true God.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:33.300
Ahab, the son of Amri, became King of Israel in the 38th year of King Acer of Judah.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.300
And Ahab, the son of Amri, reigned over Israel in Samaria for 22 years.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.180
Ahab, the son of Amri, was worse in the eyes of Jehovah than all those who were prior

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.180
to him.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.259
As if it were a trivial thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebath,

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:56.259
he also took his wife, Jezebel, the daughter of Beth Baal, the King of the Sidonians, and

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:59.860
began to serve Baal and about down to him.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.539
Further, he set up an altar to Baal at the house of Baal that he built in Samaria.

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:08.060
Ahab also made the sacred pole.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:23.860
Ahab did more to offend Jehovah than all the kings of Israel prior to him.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.060
Did you note the answers to the three questions posed earlier?

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:37.139
The first wise, why is it foolish to give devotion to anything or anyone other than Jehovah?

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:44.300
One after the other, the kings who preceded Ahab offended Jehovah and suffered terrible

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.500
consequences.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:53.540
Rather than learning from the past, Ahab did more to offend Jehovah than all the kings

00:04:53.540 --> 00:05:00.180
of Israel prior to him as it says at 1 Kings 1633.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:07.939
Ahab was foolish to think that he could successfully worship both Jehovah and Baal.

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:14.279
As stated at 1 Corinthians 10-21, you cannot be drinking the cup of Jehovah and the cup

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.019
of demons.

00:05:16.019 --> 00:05:21.660
You cannot be partaking at the table of Jehovah and the table of demons.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:29.420
Ahab suffered the worst possible consequence for attempting to do this, namely Jehovah's

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.339
disapproval.

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:40.300
The second question was, what could interfere with our giving exclusive devotion to Jehovah?

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:46.899
Today, it is unlikely that a person dedicated to Jehovah would intentionally worship a false

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:48.740
deity.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:55.620
Yet one could inadvertently begin to give Jehovah less than exclusive devotion.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:04.459
Under the influence of his pagan wife Jezebel, Ahab became entangled in false worship.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:11.579
We must avoid the harmful influence of people who do not worship the only true God so that

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:16.500
our heart proves to be complete with Jehovah.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:24.139
The third question was, how does Jehovah make himself known to us as individuals?

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:30.860
First King 1630 makes mention of the eyes of Jehovah.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:37.100
Even like false gods, Jehovah has the ability to see everything we do.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:44.699
First King 1633 states that Jehovah was offended by Ahab's actions.

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:52.180
Jehovah is a real person who reminds us that he cares about his earthly creatures.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.740
Our actions can either offend him or please him.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:04.860
And how comforting it is to know that our acts of love and our loyalty to Jehovah do not

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.339
go unnoticed by him.

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:16.500
The next portion of this drama is based on First King 171-7.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:30.620
Here the Bible for the first time introduces Jehovah's fateful prophet Elijah.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:35.699
Now Elijah the Tishbite, an inhabitant of Gilead, said to Ahab,

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:42.500
As surely as Jehovah the God of Israel, whom I serve is living, during these years there

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:47.740
will be no do or reign except by my word.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.740
The word of Jehovah came to him saying,

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:57.819
Leave here and turn eastward and hide at the valley of Kyrith, east of the Jordan.

00:07:57.819 --> 00:08:04.699
You should drink from the stream and I will command the ravens to supply you food there.

00:08:04.699 --> 00:08:08.819
He immediately went and did according to the word of Jehovah.

00:08:08.819 --> 00:08:13.899
He went and stayed by the valley of Kyrith, east of the Jordan.

00:08:13.899 --> 00:08:18.180
And the ravens were bringing him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:22.300
evening and he drank from the stream.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:44.009
And after some days the stream ran dry because there was no rain in the land.

00:08:44.009 --> 00:08:53.649
Again, did you note how First King 171-7 answers the three questions posed earlier?

00:08:53.649 --> 00:08:59.850
Remember our first question, why is it foolish to give devotion to anything or anyone other

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.129
than Jehovah?

00:09:02.129 --> 00:09:09.289
As a result of Ahab's apostasy, Jehovah afflicted the land with a drought that lasted three

00:09:09.289 --> 00:09:13.129
and a half years, according to Luke 4.25.

00:09:13.129 --> 00:09:21.330
Baal, the Canaanite God of rain and fertility, could not rescue the people from such a calamity

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:25.409
because Baal was a false God.

00:09:25.409 --> 00:09:33.769
Next, what could interfere with our giving exclusive devotion to Jehovah?

00:09:33.769 --> 00:09:43.690
Central desires, material comforts, secular careers, higher education, technology, pets,

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:52.169
entertainment, food, or drink could gradually become the objects of our devotion.

00:09:52.169 --> 00:09:58.409
Getting our trust in material things can bring only calamity and can ruin our friendship

00:09:58.409 --> 00:10:00.409
with Jehovah.

00:10:00.409 --> 00:10:10.210
That is why it is so important that we heed Jesus' words found at Luke 21, 34 through 36.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:20.009
Luke 21, beginning in verse 34, Jesus said, but pay attention to yourselves that your

00:10:20.009 --> 00:10:27.970
hearts never become weighed down with overeating and heavy drinking and anxieties of life.

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:36.529
And suddenly, that day be instantly upon you as a snare, for it will come upon all those

00:10:36.529 --> 00:10:40.730
dwelling on the face of the whole earth.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:47.889
Keep awake then, all the time making supplication that you may succeed in escaping all these

00:10:47.889 --> 00:10:56.289
things that must occur and in standing before the Son of Man.

00:10:56.289 --> 00:11:03.529
Finally, how does Jehovah make Himself known to us as individuals?

00:11:03.529 --> 00:11:09.970
Jehovah has power over the forces of nature as highlighted by his ability to produce a

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.929
drought over the land.

00:11:12.929 --> 00:11:19.129
He also demonstrated his power over earthly creatures, such as the ravens that he used

00:11:19.129 --> 00:11:21.289
to feed Elijah.

00:11:21.289 --> 00:11:26.929
The false gods of the people had no such powers.

00:11:26.929 --> 00:11:34.889
Today, Jehovah demonstrates his power by preventing his enemies from eradicating pure worship.

00:11:34.889 --> 00:11:45.929
This is in keeping with his promise found at Isaiah 54-17, which says,

00:11:45.929 --> 00:11:52.769
no weapon formed against you will have any success.

00:11:52.769 --> 00:11:58.169
And you will condemn any tongue that rises up against you in the judgment.

00:11:58.169 --> 00:12:01.809
This is the heritage of the servants of Jehovah.

00:12:01.809 --> 00:12:07.250
And their righteousness is from me, Declare's Jehovah.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:15.809
Yes, as individuals, we receive Jehovah's help to cope with the anxieties of this

00:12:15.809 --> 00:12:18.210
world.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:27.210
The next portion of this drama is based on First Kings 1817-46.

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:34.370
This account begins three and a half years into the severe drought, famine, as afflicted

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:38.809
Israel by the hand of Jehovah.

00:12:38.809 --> 00:12:44.690
Even in the face of such divine discipline, they have and many other Israelites

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:51.970
obstinately persist in their worship of the false god, Bale, while pretending also to

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.850
worship the true God, Jehovah.

00:12:54.850 --> 00:13:02.610
Ahab has been searching for Elijah for a long time, because he feels that Elijah is responsible

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:04.730
for the drought.

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:24.899
Let us listen as Ahab finally meets Elijah face to face.

00:13:24.899 --> 00:13:28.539
As soon as Ahab saw Elijah, he said to him,

00:13:28.539 --> 00:13:32.460
Is this you, the one bringing great trouble on Israel?

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:33.980
To this he said,

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:39.820
I have not brought trouble on Israel, but you in the house of your father have, by abandoning

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:44.299
the commandments of Jehovah and by following the Bales.

00:13:44.299 --> 00:13:51.659
And now, summon all Israel to me at Mount Carmel, as well as the 450 prophets of Bale,

00:13:51.659 --> 00:13:57.139
and the 400 prophets of the sacred pole, who are eating at the table of Jezebel.

00:13:57.139 --> 00:14:03.100
So Ahab sent word among all the people of Israel, and collected the prophets together at Mount

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.580
Carmel.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.779
Then Elijah approached all the people and said,

00:14:07.779 --> 00:14:12.860
How long will you be limping between two different opinions?

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:20.100
If Jehovah is the true God, follow him, but if Bale is, follow him.

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:23.659
But the people did not say a word in answer to him.

00:14:23.659 --> 00:14:26.139
Elijah then said to the people,

00:14:26.139 --> 00:14:32.820
I am the only prophet of Jehovah left, while the prophets of Bale are 450 men.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:39.779
Let them give us two young bulls, and let them choose one young bull, and cut it into pieces,

00:14:39.779 --> 00:14:43.659
and put it on the wood, but they should not put fire to it.

00:14:43.659 --> 00:14:49.019
I will prepare the other young bull, and I will place it on the wood, but I will not

00:14:49.019 --> 00:14:51.179
put fire to it.

00:14:51.179 --> 00:14:56.860
Then you must call on the name of your God, and I will call on the name of Jehovah.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:03.179
The God who answers by fire will show that he is the true God.

00:15:03.179 --> 00:15:05.980
To this all the people answered,

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:08.779
What you say is good.

00:15:08.779 --> 00:15:11.980
Elijah now said to the prophets of Bale,

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:18.340
choose one young bull, and prepare it first, because you are the majority.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:23.220
Then call on the name of your God, but you must not put fire to it.

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:28.700
So they took the young bull that was given to them, prepared it, and kept calling on the

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.259
name of Bale from morning until noon, saying,

00:15:32.259 --> 00:15:35.500
Oh, Bale, answer us.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.500
Bale, answer us.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:41.980
But there was no voice and no one answering.

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:45.940
They kept limping around the altar that they had made.

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:50.059
But noon Elijah began to mock them and say,

00:15:50.059 --> 00:15:52.940
Call out at the top of your voice.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:59.779
After all, he is a God, perhaps he is deep in thought, or he has gone to relieve himself,

00:15:59.779 --> 00:16:06.779
or maybe he is asleep, and someone needs to wake him up.

00:16:06.779 --> 00:16:11.820
They were calling out at the top of their voice and cutting themselves with daggers and

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:18.259
lancers, according to the customer, until they blood and gushed out all over them.

00:16:18.259 --> 00:16:23.940
noon was passed, and they continued in a frenzy until the time the evening grain offering

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.659
is presented.

00:16:26.659 --> 00:16:32.980
But there was no voice and no one answering, no one was paying attention.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:40.899
At length Elijah said to all the people, approach me, so all the people approached him.

00:16:40.899 --> 00:16:47.100
When he repaired the altar of Jehovah that had been torn down, Elijah then took 12 stones

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:51.940
corresponding to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom Jehovah's word

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:56.700
had come, saying, Israel will be your name.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:02.980
With the stones he built an altar in the name of Jehovah, then he made a trench all around

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:09.539
the altar, an area large enough to sew with two sear measures of seed.

00:17:09.539 --> 00:17:15.019
After that he put the pieces of wood in order, cut the young bull into pieces, and placed

00:17:15.019 --> 00:17:17.059
it on the wood.

00:17:17.059 --> 00:17:23.740
He now said, fill four large jars with water, and pour it on the burnt offering, and on

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:26.019
the pieces of wood.

00:17:26.019 --> 00:17:32.700
Then he said, do it again, so they did it again.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:40.019
Once more he said, do it a third time, so they did it a third time.

00:17:40.019 --> 00:17:47.299
And the water ran all around the altar, and he also filled the trench with water.

00:17:47.299 --> 00:17:52.579
About the time when the evening grain offering is presented, Elijah the Prophet stepped forward

00:17:52.579 --> 00:17:53.940
and said,

00:17:53.940 --> 00:18:02.019
O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, today let it be known that you are God

00:18:02.019 --> 00:18:07.500
in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that it is by your word that I have done

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.500
all these things.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:15.460
Answer me, O Jehovah, answer me so that this people may know that you, Jehovah, are

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:20.900
the true God, and that you are turning their hearts back to you.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:26.940
Yet that the fire of Jehovah fell from above, and consumed the burnt offering, the pieces

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:33.579
of wood, the stones, and the dust, and it leaped up the water from the trench.

00:18:33.579 --> 00:18:39.779
When all the people saw it, they immediately fell face down and said, Jehovah is the true

00:18:39.779 --> 00:18:44.819
God, Jehovah is the true God, Jehovah.

00:18:44.819 --> 00:18:46.819
Then Elijah said to them,

00:18:46.819 --> 00:18:51.819
O Jehovah, seize the prophets of Bale, do not let a single one of them escape.

00:18:51.819 --> 00:18:57.819
At once they seized them, and Elijah brought them down to the stream of Kaishan and slaughtered

00:18:57.819 --> 00:18:58.819
them there.

00:18:58.819 --> 00:19:01.819
Elijah now said to Ahab,

00:19:01.819 --> 00:19:07.299
Go up, eat, and drink, for there is the sound of a heavy downpour.

00:19:07.299 --> 00:19:14.299
So Ahab went up to eat and drink, while Elijah went up to the top of Kamal and crouched

00:19:14.299 --> 00:19:19.059
on the ground, keeping his face between his knees.

00:19:19.059 --> 00:19:21.059
Then he said to his attendant,

00:19:21.059 --> 00:19:24.579
Go up, please, and look toward the sea.

00:19:24.579 --> 00:19:27.700
So he went up and looked and said,

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.579
There is nothing at all.

00:19:29.579 --> 00:19:31.539
Seven times Elijah said,

00:19:31.539 --> 00:19:33.339
Go back.

00:19:33.339 --> 00:19:36.539
The seventh time his attendant said,

00:19:36.539 --> 00:19:42.859
Look, there is a small cloud, like a man's hand,

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.660
ascending out of the sea.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.259
He now said,

00:19:47.259 --> 00:19:49.619
Go, say to Ahab,

00:19:49.619 --> 00:19:51.220
Hitch up the chariot,

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:55.339
Go down so that the downpour may not detain you.

00:19:55.339 --> 00:19:59.500
Meanwhile, the sky grew dark with clouds,

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.019
the wind blew,

00:20:01.019 --> 00:20:03.619
and a heavy downpour fell,

00:20:03.619 --> 00:20:07.859
and Ahab kept riding and made his way to Jesu'il,

00:20:07.859 --> 00:20:11.140
but the hand of Jehovah came on Elijah,

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.819
and he wrapped his garment around his hips,

00:20:13.819 --> 00:20:17.380
and ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jesu'il.

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:26.109
Yet again,

00:20:26.109 --> 00:20:29.230
recall how this reading provides the answers

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:32.829
to the questions posed at the outset.

00:20:32.829 --> 00:20:36.589
First, why is it foolish to give devotion

00:20:36.589 --> 00:20:39.710
to anything or anyone other than Jehovah?

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:44.150
Elijah presented the people with a choice.

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.549
How long will you be limping

00:20:46.589 --> 00:20:49.109
between two different opinions?

00:20:49.109 --> 00:20:53.549
If Jehovah is the true God, follow him.

00:20:53.549 --> 00:20:56.549
But if Bale is, follow him.

00:20:57.869 --> 00:20:59.710
Shortly thereafter,

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:03.269
Jehovah produced irrefutable evidence

00:21:03.269 --> 00:21:06.950
of Bale's uselessness as a God.

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:10.990
Not a single one of Bale's prophets escaped punishment

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:12.670
by death.

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:16.990
Bale totally failed his worshipers.

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:20.829
It makes no sense to offend Jehovah,

00:21:20.829 --> 00:21:23.630
the source of life and true happiness.

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:30.230
Second, what could interfere with our giving exclusive devotion

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:32.990
to Jehovah?

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:35.509
When the Israelites witnessed the fire of Jehovah

00:21:35.509 --> 00:21:38.670
consuming the bull, the water, the wood,

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:40.910
and even the stones,

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:43.670
they were moved to declare repeatedly

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:46.269
that Jehovah is the only true God.

00:21:47.349 --> 00:21:50.029
The nation of Israel had been Jehovah's people

00:21:50.029 --> 00:21:51.509
for almost 600 years,

00:21:51.509 --> 00:21:55.549
and were well aware of His mighty power.

00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:58.150
The nation did not need to witness another miracle

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:00.990
to acknowledge Jehovah as the true God.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:05.309
Obviously, their senses had become dull,

00:22:05.309 --> 00:22:08.269
as if they had forgotten the wonderful things

00:22:08.309 --> 00:22:10.230
Jehovah had done for them.

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:15.349
Today, we must be determined never to forget

00:22:15.349 --> 00:22:18.670
the wonderful things that Jehovah has done for us

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:22.670
as individuals and as a people.

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:27.109
We do well to meditate on the abundant evidence

00:22:27.109 --> 00:22:29.109
of His Godship.

00:22:29.109 --> 00:22:34.190
Finally, how does Jehovah make Himself known to us

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:35.630
as individuals?

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:40.309
Jehovah answered Elijah's fervent prayers

00:22:40.309 --> 00:22:43.390
for fire and rain.

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:48.710
Jehovah continues to be the hero of prayer today.

00:22:49.589 --> 00:22:53.589
First John 514 states that no matter what we ask

00:22:53.589 --> 00:22:57.029
according to His will, He hears us.

00:22:58.349 --> 00:23:02.230
Jehovah miraculously empowered Elijah

00:23:02.269 --> 00:23:06.230
to outrun Ahab's horse-drawn chariot

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:09.990
for a distance of 19 miles.

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:14.109
Today, Jehovah's spirit gives us power

00:23:14.109 --> 00:23:18.769
beyond what is normal to face our challenges successfully.

00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:21.950
As the Apostle Paul wrote,

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:25.269
as recorded at Philippians 413,

00:23:25.269 --> 00:23:29.670
for all things I have the strength through the one

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:33.789
who gives me power.

00:23:33.789 --> 00:23:36.269
Now, the next portion of this drama

00:23:36.269 --> 00:23:41.269
is based on 1 Kings 19, 1 through 8.

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:47.789
This account reveals a very human side of Elijah.

00:23:48.869 --> 00:23:52.670
Faced with a death threat from wicked King Jezebel,

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:57.670
Elijah becomes frustrated and depressed.

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:00.910
Let us listen in and see how Jehovah

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:05.910
comes to Elijah's rescue and proves to be the true God.

00:24:18.519 --> 00:24:22.640
Then Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.799
and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.

00:24:26.759 --> 00:24:29.960
At that, Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah saying,

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.319
so may that God's due to me and add to it.

00:24:34.319 --> 00:24:35.960
If by this time tomorrow,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.279
I do not make you like each one of them.

00:24:40.319 --> 00:24:42.680
At that, he became afraid.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.200
So he got up and ran for his life.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:49.559
He came to be a sheba which belongs to Judah

00:24:49.559 --> 00:24:52.000
and he left his attendant there.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.759
He went a day's journey into the wilderness

00:24:54.759 --> 00:24:58.079
and came and sat down under a broom tree

00:24:58.079 --> 00:25:00.920
and he asked that he might die.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:01.920
He said,

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.720
it is enough.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:07.079
Now, O Jehovah, take my life away

00:25:07.079 --> 00:25:09.759
for I am no better than my forefathers.

00:25:09.759 --> 00:25:13.920
Then he laid down and fell asleep under the broom tree.

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:17.480
But suddenly an angel touched him and said to him,

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.240
get up and eat.

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.720
When he looked,

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:24.319
there at his head was a round loaf on heated stones

00:25:24.319 --> 00:25:25.480
and a jug of water.

00:25:26.759 --> 00:25:30.319
He ate and drank and laid down again.

00:25:30.319 --> 00:25:32.279
Later, the angel of Jehovah came back

00:25:32.279 --> 00:25:35.359
and touched him and said,

00:25:35.359 --> 00:25:39.839
get up and eat for the journey will be too much for you.

00:25:39.839 --> 00:25:42.599
So he got up and ate and drank

00:25:42.599 --> 00:25:45.359
and in the strength of that nourishment,

00:25:45.359 --> 00:25:48.759
he went on for 40 days and 40 nights

00:25:48.759 --> 00:25:50.559
until he reached Horeb,

00:25:50.559 --> 00:26:00.049
the mountain of the true God.

00:26:00.049 --> 00:26:05.049
Once again, our three questions find resounding answers.

00:26:06.049 --> 00:26:09.609
One, why is it foolish to give devotion

00:26:09.609 --> 00:26:12.529
to anything or anyone other than Jehovah?

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:17.769
Even after the miracles performed on Mount Carmo,

00:26:17.769 --> 00:26:21.970
a habit Jezebel remained unrepentant.

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:25.329
They sank into a disapproved mental state,

00:26:25.329 --> 00:26:29.009
having gone past all moral sense.

00:26:29.009 --> 00:26:32.329
This shows that a pattern of disobedience

00:26:32.329 --> 00:26:35.329
or half-hearted worship can harden us

00:26:35.329 --> 00:26:37.609
and draw us away from the true God.

00:26:38.569 --> 00:26:41.730
Two, what could interfere

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:45.329
with our giving exclusive devotion to Jehovah?

00:26:46.369 --> 00:26:50.730
Elijah was a man with feelings like hours.

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:54.529
He became depressed and felt like giving up.

00:26:55.529 --> 00:26:59.890
Although all of us are susceptible to negative feelings,

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:04.890
we must not allow them to paralyze us spiritually.

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:09.890
Three, how does Jehovah make himself known to us as individuals?

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:14.930
The angel of Jehovah literally fed Elijah

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:19.930
and also infused him with spiritual and emotional strength.

00:27:21.009 --> 00:27:25.170
As humans, we will experience periods of sadness

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:27.210
and frustration.

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:30.250
Jehovah makes himself known to us as individuals

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:34.410
by infusing us with encouragement through his word,

00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:38.210
his Holy Spirit, and the Christian congregation.

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:44.170
We can trust Jehovah to rescue us from the depths of despair.

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:51.170
The Bible account of Elijah teaches us many valuable lessons.

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:55.809
The prophets of Bale come to realize, but too late,

00:27:55.809 --> 00:27:59.289
that Jehovah is the only true God.

00:27:59.289 --> 00:28:02.089
But that lesson is only the beginning.

00:28:02.089 --> 00:28:04.009
As the only true God,

00:28:04.009 --> 00:28:09.009
Jehovah deserves and expects our exclusive devotion.

00:28:09.849 --> 00:28:14.690
Nothing should compete with our whole soul worship of Him.

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:18.730
Moreover, He has the power and the desire

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:21.450
to bless and protect us.

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:23.690
As the only true God,

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:28.690
He will be loyal to all those loyal to Him.

00:28:29.089 --> 00:28:34.089
Therefore, may each of us continue to demonstrate intense loyalty

00:28:35.809 --> 00:28:40.809
to our Heavenly Father, the only true God, Jehovah.
