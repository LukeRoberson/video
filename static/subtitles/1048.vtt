00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:05.990
Would you like to assist with a Theocratic building project?

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:12.830
You may see reports regarding branch construction and renovation or the need for new kingdom halls

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.470
and remote translation offices.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.030
And this may cause you to wonder if you could have a share.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.149
Well, that is a wonderful goal.

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:28.469
Now as we've considered in this symposium, it takes faith to do more for Jehovah.

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:34.350
Well, likewise, faith is required to share in a Theocratic building project.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.030
Now, why is that?

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.549
Well, generally, there are two concerns.

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:41.429
One, we may lack experience.

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:45.109
We may feel that we do not have construction, design, engineering,

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:47.270
or real estate experience.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:54.549
And thus, we may feel inadequate to assist with a local design construction or other project.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.630
Or two, we may also realize that to begin assisting,

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.350
generally, we do so on a temporary basis.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:09.510
Therefore, we may have concerns about leaving our job or our family for a period of time to assist.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.909
Well, if you can relate to those concerns and note out the example of Nehemiah,

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.870
we'll build your faith.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.590
Turn please to Nehemiah chapter one, verse two and three.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.349
Nehemiah one, two and three.

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:30.790
At that time, Haneinah, one of my brothers, arrived with other men from Judah.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:37.189
And I asked him about the remaining Jews who had escaped the captivity and also about Jerusalem.

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:42.430
They replied, those remaining there in the province who have survived the captivity

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.230
are in a terrible situation and in disgrace.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:52.629
The walls of Jerusalem are broken down and his gates have been burned with fire.

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:55.109
But Nehemiah here is presented with the knee.

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:56.109
What would he do?

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:57.109
What do you say?

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:01.189
Oh, I hope those skilled brothers help that situation one day.

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.109
Look at chapter two and verse five.

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:10.069
I then said to the king, if it pleases the king and if your servant has found favor with

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:17.789
you, send me to Judah, to the city where my forefathers are buried, so that I may rebuild

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:18.789
it.

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:20.229
Yes, Nehemiah was moved.

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:22.349
He wanted to help.

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.229
He saw an opportunity and demonstrated his faith.

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:28.830
He took the initiative.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.310
Now did it take faith for Nehemiah to take this step?

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.270
Well, no doubt it did.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.550
Why do we say that?

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.629
Well, first off, what was Nehemiah's work assignment?

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.909
Was he the head of the King's construction project?

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:46.909
Was he the leading architect or engineer or city planner?

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:47.909
No.

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:52.069
No, rather, he was the cup bearer to the king.

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.590
You can pitch your hymns saying, well, I don't have the experience to rebuild the walls

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.590
of Jerusalem.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.310
I wouldn't even know where to start.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.629
Maybe I best leave that to somebody else.

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.229
No, rather, he saw the need.

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:07.949
He had the circumstances to help and he acted on that knee.

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:13.590
At Nehemiah did not let his possible lack of experience hold him back.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.430
That took faith.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.150
Now what about the fact that this was only a temporary assignment?

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.310
Well, Nehemiah again was willing to leave his prestigious position as the cup bearer

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.310
to the king.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.310
You think about it?

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.830
He could have wondered whether his replacement would take over his position permanently.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.110
Would his nice job be there when he returned from Jerusalem?

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.949
Well Nehemiah showed faith that Jehovah had loyal love and would remember him.

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:47.789
Notice his words in Nehemiah chapter 1 and verse 5.

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:54.909
I said, Oh Jehovah, the God of the heavens, the great and awe-inspiring God who keeps

00:03:54.909 --> 00:04:02.310
his covenant and shows loyal love to those who love him and keep his commandments.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.949
As Nehemiah was confident, Jehovah would show loyal love.

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:08.430
Jehovah would work things out.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.469
And what was the result of Nehemiah's faith?

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:16.790
Well, although at first Nehemiah was not known as a builder, Jehovah used him in a mighty

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.189
way to accomplish, as well.

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:26.430
And Nehemiah contributed to the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem in significant ways.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.430
What's the lesson?

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.790
Well, the lesson is we need faith if we are going to assist with a theocratic building

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:34.790
project.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.750
Now primarily, we need brothers and sisters who have a strong relationship with Jehovah

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.389
and a willing spirit.

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.470
Those are the qualities we need.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.750
A construction or technical skills can be learned.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.910
And strong faith will give us the confidence that if we are invited, Jehovah will make

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.430
us equal to the task and help us to develop the skills that are needed.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.629
And faith will also help us to trust that Jehovah will care for us when our assignment

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:05.670
is over.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:12.230
In the following video, note how Sarah found the courage to assist in a theocratic

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:21.259
building project.

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:26.459
When I learned I was invited to work for a few weeks on the upcoming construction projects,

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:27.459
I was thrilled.

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:39.019
But her excitement quickly turned into anxiety because of what I had to do.

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:43.899
I pray to Jehovah for weeks to give me the strength to have the conversation with my

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:44.899
employer.

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:58.129
All right.

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:59.129
So?

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:02.129
I wanted to first of all say thank you for taking it.

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:07.370
I began to explain about the construction project and how it had been invited to volunteer

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:08.370
the time.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:14.050
So you want time off during the busiest time of our year?

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.189
Well, yes.

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:23.389
It's your choice, but under no circumstances will uphold your position.

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:32.500
Suddenly, this beautiful privilege felt like a huge risk.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:50.930
Was I making my life more complicated by doing this?

00:06:50.930 --> 00:07:00.009
I read the account about the people in Nehemiah's day, their will in spirit demonstrated faith

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:10.050
and Jerusalem's walls were built by people who put their heart into the work.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.850
I didn't want to miss out on the opportunity to save Jehovah in that way.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:16.170
This is my resignation letter.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:26.139
I had to have faith that Jehovah will bless my decision.

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:32.019
I'm not sure what the future holds when I get back, but I know Jehovah will take care

00:07:32.019 --> 00:07:33.019
of me.

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:53.990
For now, I'm going to focus on putting my heart into the work.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:59.949
Can you relate to when Sarah went to meet her employer or how she struggled with the decision

00:07:59.949 --> 00:08:00.949
of what to do?

00:08:00.949 --> 00:08:04.189
Well, how did Sarah resolve her concerns?

00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:10.110
I remember she examined the example of Nehemiah and others and this gave her courage to act.

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:14.310
And as a result, she enjoyed many blessings.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:18.149
Well many of our brothers and sisters have made the same choice.

00:08:18.149 --> 00:08:22.790
For example, one couple had to give up their apartment and resign from their secular

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:25.509
employment to help with the project.

00:08:25.509 --> 00:08:31.829
Now they said they did feel some anxiety as the end of their six-month assignment near,

00:08:31.829 --> 00:08:36.629
but they trusted that Jehovah would help them and help he did.

00:08:36.629 --> 00:08:40.750
When they returned, they called their former employer, and Nully did he offer them their

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:43.950
job back, but it was at better terms.

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:49.669
And they said that within one week of returning back, they had found a new apartment.

00:08:49.669 --> 00:08:54.629
In another example, the local design construction department invited a brother to work for a few

00:08:54.629 --> 00:08:56.590
months on a project.

00:08:56.590 --> 00:09:00.509
Now at the time, he was working full-time with a major company.

00:09:00.509 --> 00:09:05.309
He had good benefits, a good salary, a company car, housing.

00:09:05.309 --> 00:09:07.789
He requested a leave of absence.

00:09:07.789 --> 00:09:09.950
They denied his request.

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:13.789
Our brother decided to take the LDC assignment anyway.

00:09:13.789 --> 00:09:16.149
He was fired from his job.

00:09:16.149 --> 00:09:19.149
So what would he do after he completed his assignment?

00:09:19.149 --> 00:09:25.389
Well, he actually was able to find a part-time job that has allowed him to stay in full-time

00:09:25.389 --> 00:09:26.389
service.

00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:30.750
And now he is a pioneer, he and his wife are pioneers, and he's serving as a remote

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:34.429
volunteer for a branch construction project.

00:09:34.429 --> 00:09:39.429
And similar stories are repeated over and over.

00:09:39.429 --> 00:09:45.710
Jehovah foretold that during these last days, a great crowd would worship him acceptably.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:50.830
And the fulfillment of that prophecy has created an urgent need for more kingdom halls, assembly

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:54.950
halls, branch facilities, remote translation offices.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:10:01.590
Now we understand that the pandemic has limited theocratic building projects to some extent

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:03.070
at this time.

00:10:03.149 --> 00:10:09.710
However, there is still much work to do now and on into the future.

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:14.669
So if your health and circumstances permit, make yourself available.

00:10:14.669 --> 00:10:20.750
You can do so by filling out the A19 and DC50 applications.

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:26.350
Your elders can help you to access these on JW.org.

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:31.590
So if assisting with a theocratic building project is your goal, you can be confident

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:36.029
that you too will become powerful by faith.

00:10:36.029 --> 00:10:37.389
Take that leap.

00:10:37.389 --> 00:10:43.669
You will enjoy Jehovah's support and many, many blessings.

00:10:43.669 --> 00:10:48.549
Now brother Gaius Glocken team, a helper to the publishing committee will consider the

00:10:48.549 --> 00:10:56.029
final talk of this symposium, enter the door to activity and faith, set something aside

00:10:56.029 --> 00:10:57.149
for Jehovah's work.
