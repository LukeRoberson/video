WEBVTT

00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:23.989
We welcome all of you to the December program of JW Broadcasting.

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:26.989
This month, we have something different to share with you.

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:30.989
The governing body has decided that Gilea graduations

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.990
and the spiritual portion of the annual meeting programs

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.990
will be featured as monthly JW Broadcasting programs each year.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.990
At this time, you'll be able to watch the first part

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.990
of the graduation of the 143rd Class of Gilea.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.990
You will enjoy listening to the five scriptural talks

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.990
that will each be introduced to you by brother heard

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.990
of the governing body.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.990
Most languages that our monthly program is produced

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.990
and did not have the resources to also translate

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.989
and produce the Gilea graduation.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.989
Now, by using the graduation as the monthly program,

00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:11.989
many more of our brothers and sisters around the world

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:15.989
will be able to enjoy this rich spiritual banquet.

00:01:15.989 --> 00:01:18.989
We now invite you to enjoy part one

00:01:18.989 --> 00:01:22.989
of the graduation of the 143rd Class of Gilea.

00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:32.329
It's graduation day for this 143rd Class of Gilea.

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.329
And it's been a long time coming with a lot of work.

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.329
Worry, sweat, nerve-wracking parts

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.329
given in front of your instructors and fellow classmates.

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.329
Wow, woo.

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:56.329
But none of you received a feeling great, not one.

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.329
You're going to graduate today.

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:00.329
This is your day.

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.329
And that's a joyful day, isn't it?

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.329
A very joyful day for you

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.330
and a joyful day for each and every one of us.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.330
We're glad you came to Gilea's school

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.330
and it saddens us a bit to know you're leaving us.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.330
You're not going to be here much longer.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.330
You're fine spiritual instructors,

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:31.330
brothers Kothon, Lippo, Numer, Samuelson, and Stovol.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.330
They would like to cry,

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.330
but they're good, manly men

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.330
and it's hard for good, manly men to cry in public.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.409
Of course, there is a host of others,

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:50.409
too many to name, such as Sam Hurd.

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:55.409
Oops, it just slipped out beyond my control.

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.409
Your instructors have done a fine job of helping you

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:03.409
to open your eyes to see your grand instructor,

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:05.409
mentioned at Isaiah 30-20.

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:09.409
After all, he is the one who has been teaching

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:14.409
by giving his Holy Spirit to all these brothers

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:16.409
that I've mentioned.

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.409
Look at what is stated at Isaiah 66-1.

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:24.900
66-1, it says,

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.900
this is what Jehovah says.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.900
The heavens are my throne and the earth is my footstool.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.219
For the last five months,

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:37.219
you've been sitting at Jehovah's feet

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:41.219
and you have been taught by your grand instructor.

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:45.219
What you have learned is much more than you knew

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:49.219
when you first sat down five months ago.

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:51.219
Without a doubt,

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:53.219
the knowledge you have taken in

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:57.219
has brought you closer to Jehovah.

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:00.219
You have really drawn close to Jehovah

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:04.219
and he has drawn close to you.

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:09.219
However, you've only scratched the surface.

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:18.060
Job said,

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.410
did you hear what I said?

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.410
Of course you didn't.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.410
Now,

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.410
let's read the scripture.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.410
Job 26-14.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.410
Look, these are just the fringes of his ways.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:41.670
Only a faint whisper has been heard of him.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.670
This is just about as much as we have learned

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.670
compared to what Jehovah knows.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.269
Who knows all that Jehovah knows?

00:04:53.269 --> 00:04:55.269
No one.

00:04:55.269 --> 00:04:56.269
Not even Jesus.

00:04:56.269 --> 00:05:02.019
And he knows quite a bit more than we do.

00:05:02.019 --> 00:05:05.019
He's been around longer, hasn't he?

00:05:05.019 --> 00:05:07.019
Much longer.

00:05:07.019 --> 00:05:11.019
In fact, Jesus was present when the earth was created.

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:13.019
When was that?

00:05:13.019 --> 00:05:15.019
Well, if you've been listening to Morning Worship,

00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:17.019
you'll know that one of the members of the governing body

00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:19.019
told us in Proverbs chapter 8,

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:21.019
he says, take a look at that,

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:23.019
read it in verse 9 and 30,

00:05:23.019 --> 00:05:25.019
and he read it to us.

00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:27.019
He said, this is what it says,

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:29.019
when he established the foundations of the earth,

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:33.019
then I was beside him as a master worker.

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:35.019
Do you remember that?

00:05:35.019 --> 00:05:37.019
You don't, if you didn't hear the day's text,

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:39.019
or read it.

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:41.019
But we are convinced that you heard it,

00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:43.019
and you read it.

00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:45.019
Well, that's a long time, isn't it?

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:47.019
The earth, foundations of the earth.

00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:49.019
How long?

00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:53.019
Just on the very old circon rock from Australia,

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:57.019
some scientists say we know that the earth is at least four

00:05:57.019 --> 00:05:59.019
and one half billion years old.

00:05:59.019 --> 00:06:03.019
Give or take a hundred million years.

00:06:03.019 --> 00:06:07.019
Well, no one really knows down here on earth.

00:06:07.019 --> 00:06:11.019
We have to listen to some of these so-called wise men.

00:06:11.019 --> 00:06:15.019
Jesus in His prehuman existence was there.

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:17.019
There's no doubt about that.

00:06:17.019 --> 00:06:19.019
Question chapter 1 shows that that he was there.

00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:23.019
He was at Jehovah's side way before

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:25.019
then listening and learning.

00:06:25.019 --> 00:06:27.019
And he's at Jehovah's side today, isn't he?

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:29.019
You know that.

00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:31.019
He's right there seated beside Jehovah

00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:37.019
doing the work that Jehovah had outlined that should be done.

00:06:37.019 --> 00:06:39.019
When measured by Jesus,

00:06:39.019 --> 00:06:41.019
we're newborn infants.

00:06:41.019 --> 00:06:46.370
We barely have our eyes open.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.370
Barely.

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:54.370
What we see is not what we're going to see in years to come.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.370
We're just looking.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.370
We're just learning.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.370
We're touching things and for the first time.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.370
Just like in the past ten years,

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:08.370
how many things we've touched for the first time?

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.370
Even though we've read the Bible over and over again

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.370
and we've listened to it being read to us over and over again,

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.370
but we've just touched a few things.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.370
Like the generation.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.370
At 20 years ago we had a generation.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.370
And now we know all about that generation, right?

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.370
And so many other things.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:30.639
Dragon it.

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:32.639
Many other things.

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:34.639
Like the sanctification of God's name.

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:36.639
Vindication of His sovereignty.

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:38.639
Touch, touch, touch.

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:40.639
You Gilead students.

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:42.639
You've touched a few things.

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:44.639
Not everything.

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:48.660
Not everything.

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.660
But what you have learned

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:57.629
put to good use in your assignments.

00:07:57.629 --> 00:07:59.629
Keep in mind

00:07:59.629 --> 00:08:01.629
you don't know it all.

00:08:01.629 --> 00:08:05.629
And here's something else you never will.

00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:07.629
No matter how long we live,

00:08:07.629 --> 00:08:09.629
we'll never know it all.

00:08:09.629 --> 00:08:13.629
Jehovah will still be revealing things to us.

00:08:13.629 --> 00:08:15.629
And they're always good things.

00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:19.629
We benefit from what Jehovah gives us.

00:08:19.629 --> 00:08:21.629
He knows exactly what we need

00:08:21.629 --> 00:08:27.310
and he gives it to us.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:29.310
So always keep that in mind.

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:33.309
We're students under Jehovah.

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:38.309
And that's where we'll always be.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:43.990
But we're happy.

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:45.990
We're glad to be here.

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:49.990
We're glad to be here with you students.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:51.990
Every one of you.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.990
And you're good students, too.

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:55.990
Now it's true,

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:57.990
not all of you are A plus suit students.

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:02.299
I'm not either.

00:09:02.299 --> 00:09:07.639
I was happy to get a good C plus and school.

00:09:07.639 --> 00:09:13.039
Well, we're going to get started now

00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:16.039
with the major part of our meeting.

00:09:16.039 --> 00:09:20.610
Being happy despite challenges

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:24.610
is the theme of Brother Garrett Losh's talk.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:27.610
Brother Losh is a member of the governing body.

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:33.610
He is the senior member of the governing body.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.610
Now I mean to that,

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:37.610
he's been a member of the governing body

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.610
longer than the rest of us.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:44.460
I'm the oldest one on the governing body.

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.460
We all face challenges of some sort.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:50.460
So let's listen carefully to what he has to say.

00:09:50.460 --> 00:10:18.200
Oh, happy day.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.200
These are the first words of a gospel song.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.200
And it goes on to say,

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:28.200
oh, happy day when Jesus washed my sins away.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:33.200
And we can agree with this music lyrics

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.200
from the 18th century.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:42.200
We agree that forgiveness of sins makes happy, doesn't it?

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.200
But for many others,

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.200
the happy day is the pay day.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.200
At the end of the month.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.200
Now what is a happy day for you students?

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.200
Graduation day.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.200
But you are not happy because it's over,

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:04.200
but because you had the privilege to attend Gilead.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.200
Many in the world believe that if they had more money,

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.200
they would be happier.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.200
However, many who made gaining of wealth

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.200
that chief goal in life now suffered this appointment.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.200
Some have lost their house,

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.200
being unable to play the mortgage

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:24.200
when they were laid off from work.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.200
Wealth does not bring happiness.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:31.200
Rather, lasting happiness comes from doing Jehovah's will.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.200
What is happiness?

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.200
Happiness is a state of well-being,

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:41.200
contentment, even deep and intense joy.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.200
But in the world, many are unhappy.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:48.200
In 2015, there were more than twice as many suicides

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.200
in the United States,

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:55.200
namely 44,193,

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.200
and more than homicides.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.200
There were only 17,000 of those.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.200
Up to 120 people take their life

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.200
in the United States each day.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.200
How sad.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.860
Though very rare,

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:15.860
due to depression,

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.860
even some true Christians have taken their life.

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:22.860
But generally, we are happy people, aren't we?

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:26.860
And here are 12 reasons for our happiness.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:28.860
For one, we can be happy

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.860
because we worship a happy God,

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.860
some 33, 12.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:38.860
Happy is the nation whose God is Jehovah.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.860
Secondly, because we have our sins forgiven,

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.860
as mentioned in the introduction.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:45.860
Romans 4.7 says,

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:49.860
those whose lawless deeds have been pardoned

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:53.860
and whose sins have been covered.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.860
Number three, we can be happy

00:12:55.860 --> 00:13:00.860
because we are being loved by Jehovah and Jesus.

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.860
Four, we're happy because of being united

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:07.860
with our worldwide brotherhood.

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.860
Five, we can be happy

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.860
because of living in a spiritual paradise,

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:15.860
having peace with Jehovah, with our brothers,

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.860
and also having plenty of spiritual food.

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:24.860
Six, in the sermon on the Mount Jesus emphasized spirituality

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:25.860
when he said,

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.860
happy are those conscious of their spiritual need.

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:33.860
In this sermon, he mentioned nine things that make happy.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:34.860
What things?

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:38.860
Well, you'll find out by rereading this sermon.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.860
Number seven, we are happy

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.860
because our life has meaning,

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.860
namely, according to Ephesians 1-12,

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:51.860
to serve for the praise of his glory.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:54.860
Number eight, in Revelation 1-3,

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.860
Jesus showed that reading God's word makes happy.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:02.860
He says, happy is he who reads aloud

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:06.860
and those who hear the words of this prophecy.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.860
Do you want to be happy every day?

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:14.110
Read the Bible every day.

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.110
In the book of Revelation,

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:18.110
Jesus proclaims seven happiness.

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.110
Which ones?

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:24.110
Find out by rereading Revelation.

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:27.110
Number nine, we are also happy

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:30.110
because we serve in the spiritual temple.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:33.110
In Revelation seven, not just the United,

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:36.110
but also the great crowd are shown serving

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:41.110
not near or before, but in the temple.

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:44.110
David called the Levites happy.

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:47.110
He said in Psalm 654, happy is the one

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:53.110
whom you choose to bring near to recite in your court yards.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:55.110
David arranged the Levites

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:59.110
that they could serve at the temple twice a year for one week.

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:01.110
However, in contrast,

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:04.110
all of God's people serve him in the spiritual temple

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:06.110
every year long, every day,

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:09.110
how happy we can be.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:13.110
Number 10, Psalm 40 verse 4 says,

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:17.110
happy is the man who trusts in Jehovah.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:21.110
Trust is a must to maintain happiness.

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:24.110
When you arrive in your assignment,

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:27.110
trust that Jehovah will support you.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:29.110
Trust in Jehovah's strength

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:33.110
rather than in your Gilea training and your abilities.

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:37.110
If low on funds, trust in Jehovah.

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:39.110
He will care for you.

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:44.110
If you have to learn a new language, trust.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:47.110
When you are being accused wrongly,

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:51.110
trust that matters will be clarified in time.

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:56.110
When you are discouraged, trust in better times.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:16:00.110
There is light at the end of each tunnel.

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:04.110
Number 11, we are happy because we practice giving.

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.110
And Jesus said,

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:10.110
there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:15.110
Words well known, Acts chapter 2035.

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:19.110
And 12, we are happy because of the wonderful promise

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:22.110
of a heavenly paradise for some

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:25.110
and an earthly paradise for billions.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:29.110
We are happy because this is tied to the promise of ever lasting life.

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:34.809
How does happiness show?

00:16:34.809 --> 00:16:39.809
It shows by a spirit of appreciation and expressions of appreciation.

00:16:39.809 --> 00:16:43.809
So beware of a complaining spirit.

00:16:43.809 --> 00:16:46.809
When Jehovah liberated Israel, the people were happy.

00:16:46.809 --> 00:16:49.809
However, within just a few weeks, they complained

00:16:49.809 --> 00:16:54.809
and even wanted to return to slavery in Egypt.

00:16:54.809 --> 00:16:57.809
To stay happy, have a positive outlook.

00:16:57.809 --> 00:17:00.809
Don't complain about the thorns on rose bushes

00:17:00.809 --> 00:17:07.400
but be glad that some thorn bushes have roses on it.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.400
Number 2, when you go to your assignment,

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.400
radiate the happiness you feel.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:15.400
Let others see it in your eyes, in your face, in your smile,

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:20.400
but smile not like a salesperson, but smile from the heart.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:27.680
Happiness is also shown by enjoying singing.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.680
Happy people often sing.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:34.680
Do we sing from time to time, singing in the rain

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.680
or maybe in the shower or wherever?

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:42.470
How can we deepen our happiness?

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:45.470
What others do affect our happiness

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:48.470
and what we do affects the happiness of others?

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:53.470
We simply cannot escape the fact that our happiness is intertwined

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:56.470
with the lives of many other people,

00:17:56.470 --> 00:18:00.470
our families, our friends and others.

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:04.470
Happiness is often in small things

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:10.470
and unhappiness the result of neglecting small things.

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:13.470
Happiness is not the absence of challenges

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:17.470
but the ability to overcome them.

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:20.470
Happiness does not depend on outside circumstances

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:26.470
but on your inner thoughts and your relationship with our happy God.

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:28.470
Happiness is connected with joy.

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:30.470
Enjoy is part of the fruit of the Spirit.

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:33.470
So avail yourself of the Holy Spirit

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:36.470
and you will be happier.

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.470
You can be happy though hungry

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:42.470
that was the title of a special talk.

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:45.470
Of course, you can be happy if you are not hungry.

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:48.470
Perhaps you take advantage of the happier hour

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:51.470
in a restaurant where prices are reduced.

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:57.140
You can be happy though single.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:00.140
You can be happy because of being married

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:03.140
and sometimes despite being married.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:07.140
You can be happy without children

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:11.140
and you can be happy despite children.

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:15.140
You can be happy though you are only 15 years old

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:20.140
and you can be happy though you are 85 years of age.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:23.140
You can be happy though you are sick.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:26.140
Even more happy, of course, if you are healthy.

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:30.140
You can be even happy though you lost loved ones in death.

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:34.140
You will see them again.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.140
You can be happy though persecuted for Christ's sake.

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.140
Jesus said in Luke 6, 22, 23,

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:43.140
happy are you whenever men hate you.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:46.140
Rejoice in that day and leap for joy.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:51.829
You can be happy if you lost your job.

00:19:51.829 --> 00:19:55.829
You can be happy if you lost your wallet.

00:19:56.829 --> 00:20:01.829
You can be happy if you lost your heart in San Francisco

00:20:01.829 --> 00:20:07.829
or according to one's song or somewhere else.

00:20:07.829 --> 00:20:10.829
You cannot be happy if you lost your mind.

00:20:10.829 --> 00:20:13.829
Or maybe you can't be even happier then

00:20:13.829 --> 00:20:16.829
because of not being aware of all the problems around you

00:20:16.829 --> 00:20:18.829
and affecting you.

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:27.140
If you are happy, you make others happy.

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:31.140
If you are unhappy, you make others unhappy.

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:33.140
If you are not happy with others,

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.140
others will not be happy with you.

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:39.140
Humour adds to happiness.

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:43.140
It makes pain and problems more bearable.

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:46.140
Find happiness in small things,

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.140
the sun set, the clouds in the sky,

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.140
the birds chirping,

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.140
the butterfly on the flower,

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:56.390
the dog chasing its tail.

00:20:56.390 --> 00:21:01.390
Maintain happiness by meditating on the paradise to come.

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:03.390
Keep it in expectation.

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:05.390
Daniel 12, 12 says,

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:10.390
happy is the one who keeps in expectation.

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:14.390
In paradise there will be no more tears,

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:17.390
no emotional pain, no unhappiness.

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:22.390
Everyone will be happy every day all the time.

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:25.390
So that has maintained and deep in our happiness

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:29.390
despite challenges by praising our happy God Jehovah

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:33.390
and making others and ourselves ever more happy.

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:51.240
We certainly want to thank you, Brother Loesch.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:55.240
You made all of us happy with that wonderful talk.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.240
Our next speaker is Brother Gary Brole,

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:01.240
a helper to the service committee of the governing body

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:04.240
and a branch committee member.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:08.240
His theme is, continue to give Jehovah reasons

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.240
not to forget.

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:18.500
Well, we usually don't think of Jehovah as forgetting.

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.500
After all, he's all-knowing

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:26.500
and surely he doesn't forget anything.

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.500
But you know when it comes to humans,

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.500
it is possible to forget.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:33.500
You remember the account in Deuteronomy.

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.500
Moses, in this case,

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.500
was giving caution to the Israelites

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:41.500
about life once they entered in the Promised Land,

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:46.500
and who had Deuteronomy chapter 6 and verse 12.

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:50.500
He says, be careful not to forget Jehovah

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.500
who brought you out of the land of Egypt

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.500
and out of the house of slavery.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:58.500
So it's possible for servants of God to forget Jehovah.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:02.500
But you know that street goes both ways, so to speak.

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:07.500
The apostle Paul introduces the idea

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.500
that Jehovah God can forget too.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:15.500
It's in Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 10.

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:19.500
Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 10.

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.500
Notice Jehovah's ability to forget here.

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:25.500
It says, for God is not unrighteous

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:27.500
so as to forget your work

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:31.500
and the love you showed for his name

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:36.500
by ministering and continuing to minister to the holy ones.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:40.940
So he says there are two things that Jehovah God says

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.940
he will never forget.

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:43.940
What are they?

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:47.940
Well, it's work and love.

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:51.940
Now remember the theme of this talk that I chose.

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.940
It's not give Jehovah reasons not to forget,

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:58.940
because I would imply that you haven't been doing that,

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.940
and that's not the case.

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:07.940
But the theme is continue to give Jehovah reasons not to forget.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:10.940
And so it would be good for us to look a little deeper

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.940
into these simple words of Paul,

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:18.940
because it's going to help us not to forget about Jehovah

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:21.940
and hopefully he will not forget about that.

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:24.940
So we're going to talk first about work

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:27.940
and then we'll come back and talk about love.

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:31.940
Now it is interesting that Paul did not say

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:35.940
that God would not forget your assignment.

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:39.940
Jehovah says, oh, you're a branch committee member.

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:41.940
Oh, I'll never forget that.

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:45.940
Or you're a special pioneer.

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.940
You're an elder.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:51.940
Or you're a service desk in a service department.

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:52.940
I'll never forget that.

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:55.940
That's not what Paul said in this verse.

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:58.940
What did he say?

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:03.940
He said, it's the work that he will never forget.

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:04.940
Now it's true.

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:05.940
We need branch committee.

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:06.940
We need elders.

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:08.940
We need pioneers and so forth.

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.940
But that's not what Jehovah is not going to forget.

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:15.940
It's the work that we do in the various assignments

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.940
and the various ways that we serve Jehovah God,

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:22.940
giving him whole soul service.

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.940
I'd like to tell you about a brother

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:28.940
that really understands this part of Hebrews 610 well.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:30.940
A few years ago, we had five members

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:33.940
on an assembly hall committee.

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:36.940
And we were directed to bring it down to three.

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:39.940
So we had to remove two members of every committee.

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:41.940
And a branch committee decided

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:43.940
who was going to be removed from the committee.

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:47.940
So the oldest brother, one of the oldest brothers serving

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:51.940
and age-wise, it was decided that he will come off the committee.

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:53.940
So we had to send someone to tell him.

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:55.940
We were not going to write a letter to him.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:56.940
So guess what?

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:58.940
I was chose to go tell him.

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:00.940
So I was sitting at the table,

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.940
conference table with the assembly hall committee

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:04.940
and I was nervous and I was using the scriptures,

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:06.940
trying to get to their heart.

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:07.940
Finally, I got to the point.

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:09.940
I had to say, now, YouTube brothers

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.940
are being relieved of your assignment.

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:14.940
Immediately, the elderly brother raised his hand

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:17.940
and said, can I read you a scripture?

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:20.940
And I said, yeah, please do.

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.940
And he read Hebrews 6.10.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:28.940
And he said, brothers, I'm here not for a title.

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:30.940
I'm here to work.

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:33.940
Just give me work to do.

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:36.940
It affects me every time I tell that story.

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:41.940
Because really, his comment captures what Paul is saying.

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:46.940
Jehovah will not forget your work.

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.940
Well, let's go back to Hebrews 6.10

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:52.940
because it talks about the second thing.

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:56.940
He says he's not going to forget the love.

00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:58.940
Well, what kind of love is he talking about?

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:00.940
What would Jehovah we love you?

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:01.940
Jehovah looks down.

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:02.940
Thank you very much.

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:03.940
I'll never forget you love me.

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:07.940
Well, that's true, but that's not what Paul is saying.

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:09.940
Let's read it again.

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:12.940
Verse 10, I have to say, you won't forget the work.

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:15.940
He says, and the love you showed for his name

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:21.940
by ministering and continuing to minister to the only ones.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:26.940
So there's a couple of words here that are important to understand.

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:31.940
It's you showed and ministering.

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:35.940
In other words, your love for your brother,

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:38.940
Jehovah says, look at that.

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:41.940
I'll never forget it.

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:47.049
You see, it's not an intellectual love.

00:27:47.049 --> 00:27:50.049
Now, hey, you've been in class for what, five months.

00:27:50.049 --> 00:27:52.049
I would imagine you've read every scripture.

00:27:52.049 --> 00:27:55.049
You've heard all kind of examples about showing love.

00:27:55.049 --> 00:28:00.049
You have every reason to show love.

00:28:00.049 --> 00:28:03.049
And now we encourage you go out and do it.

00:28:03.049 --> 00:28:06.049
Practice what you have learned.

00:28:06.049 --> 00:28:08.049
Remember if it's only words, what did Paul say?

00:28:08.049 --> 00:28:12.049
It's like a symbol, clashing symbol.

00:28:13.049 --> 00:28:16.049
So love means action.

00:28:16.049 --> 00:28:19.049
It doesn't just mean words.

00:28:19.049 --> 00:28:25.299
I'd like to tell you another little story about a brother

00:28:25.299 --> 00:28:28.299
that had somewhat of a difficulty with this.

00:28:28.299 --> 00:28:31.299
When I was a young circuit of his year,

00:28:31.299 --> 00:28:36.299
the district of his year, I was afraid of him.

00:28:36.299 --> 00:28:39.299
Everybody else was scared of him, too.

00:28:39.299 --> 00:28:43.299
And one circuit assembly, his wife wasn't there.

00:28:43.299 --> 00:28:48.299
And so he didn't tell anybody why she wasn't there.

00:28:48.299 --> 00:28:50.299
We'd never ask.

00:28:50.299 --> 00:28:53.299
And so anyway, the closing talk on Sunday,

00:28:53.299 --> 00:28:55.299
I decided without getting his permission

00:28:55.299 --> 00:28:57.299
to let everyone know what was going on.

00:28:57.299 --> 00:29:01.299
And I said, now, you notice that his wife isn't with him.

00:29:01.299 --> 00:29:02.299
I just wanted you to know,

00:29:02.299 --> 00:29:05.299
tomorrow she's going to have a major operation.

00:29:05.299 --> 00:29:08.299
And so we should all keep them in our prayers.

00:29:09.299 --> 00:29:10.299
Then they introduced him.

00:29:10.299 --> 00:29:11.299
He didn't come out.

00:29:11.299 --> 00:29:15.799
He was back behind stage.

00:29:15.799 --> 00:29:18.799
And a long time, I didn't know what to do, frankly.

00:29:18.799 --> 00:29:23.799
Soon, here this man comes out very, very slowly

00:29:23.799 --> 00:29:25.799
and gets the microphone.

00:29:25.799 --> 00:29:27.799
His voice is cracking.

00:29:27.799 --> 00:29:29.799
He starts talking a little bit.

00:29:29.799 --> 00:29:32.799
And he gives his whole talk in this very low tone.

00:29:32.799 --> 00:29:34.799
At the end of the program, you know,

00:29:34.799 --> 00:29:37.799
we always have this heartwarming song

00:29:38.799 --> 00:29:39.799
and he had to pray.

00:29:39.799 --> 00:29:41.799
He couldn't pray.

00:29:41.799 --> 00:29:43.799
He started crying.

00:29:43.799 --> 00:29:46.799
Finally, after a long time,

00:29:46.799 --> 00:29:49.799
he said a word or two in Jesus' name, Amen.

00:29:49.799 --> 00:29:51.799
Do you know what happened next?

00:29:51.799 --> 00:29:54.799
The circuits surrounded him.

00:29:54.799 --> 00:29:56.799
They were hugging him.

00:29:56.799 --> 00:29:58.799
Everybody was crying.

00:29:58.799 --> 00:30:00.799
He told me later.

00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:04.799
He said, Gary, I love the brothers.

00:30:04.799 --> 00:30:07.799
I just don't know how to show it.

00:30:07.799 --> 00:30:13.069
Now, if you relate to that experience,

00:30:13.069 --> 00:30:17.069
learn how to show love.

00:30:17.069 --> 00:30:19.069
You know what, what can you do?

00:30:19.069 --> 00:30:21.069
You know, it might be you need to change your face.

00:30:21.069 --> 00:30:25.069
Well, not your face, but have a softer face.

00:30:25.069 --> 00:30:30.069
Maybe you need to soften your voice.

00:30:30.069 --> 00:30:36.069
Maybe you need to develop a more inviting personality.

00:30:37.069 --> 00:30:39.069
Do things for people.

00:30:39.069 --> 00:30:41.069
Take care of the old brothers and sisters

00:30:41.069 --> 00:30:44.069
and the congregations you're going to be with.

00:30:44.069 --> 00:30:46.069
Even if it's not natural for you

00:30:46.069 --> 00:30:49.069
and you feel awkward about it, do it anyway.

00:30:49.069 --> 00:30:53.069
Because in time, it will become part of you.

00:30:53.069 --> 00:30:57.069
Because when you walk in that front door of your kingdom hall

00:30:57.069 --> 00:31:00.069
or the front door of your branch,

00:31:00.069 --> 00:31:03.069
the brothers should be drawn to you

00:31:03.069 --> 00:31:06.069
not because of your assignment,

00:31:06.069 --> 00:31:12.069
but because you have worked hard to show love.

00:31:12.069 --> 00:31:14.069
So as you go to your assignments,

00:31:14.069 --> 00:31:18.069
always remember Jehovah knows the work you have done

00:31:18.069 --> 00:31:20.069
and the love you have shown

00:31:20.069 --> 00:31:37.859
and he will never forget it.

00:31:37.859 --> 00:31:39.859
Thank you very much, Brother Broin.

00:31:39.859 --> 00:31:41.859
We'll keep those reasons in mind

00:31:41.859 --> 00:31:46.859
if we don't forget.

00:31:46.859 --> 00:31:50.859
Who am I, O Jehovah God?

00:31:50.859 --> 00:31:53.859
Do you know who asked that question?

00:31:53.859 --> 00:31:55.859
I don't.

00:31:55.859 --> 00:31:58.859
So let's give our attention to Brother Patrick LaFanca,

00:31:58.859 --> 00:32:01.859
a helper to the personnel committee of the governing body

00:32:01.859 --> 00:32:03.859
and a member of the branch committee.

00:32:03.859 --> 00:32:07.329
He will give us the answer.

00:32:07.329 --> 00:32:12.329
Gilead students, have you ever asked yourself,

00:32:12.329 --> 00:32:17.329
who am I to have been invited to Gilead school?

00:32:18.329 --> 00:32:21.329
That's a good question, isn't it?

00:32:21.329 --> 00:32:24.329
Because very few of God's people relatively speaking

00:32:24.329 --> 00:32:26.329
have had that privilege.

00:32:26.329 --> 00:32:29.329
So why you?

00:32:29.329 --> 00:32:32.329
Was it because you were smarter or better looking

00:32:32.329 --> 00:32:35.329
than the average servant of Jehovah?

00:32:35.329 --> 00:32:37.329
No.

00:32:37.329 --> 00:32:40.329
It was because of your spiritual qualities.

00:32:40.329 --> 00:32:45.329
And foremost among those was humility.

00:32:45.329 --> 00:32:48.329
You have been humble.

00:32:48.329 --> 00:32:54.329
But maintaining humility is a definite spiritual challenge.

00:32:54.329 --> 00:32:58.329
Not just for you, but for all of us really.

00:32:58.329 --> 00:33:01.329
We've all inherited the tendency to exalt ourselves.

00:33:01.329 --> 00:33:08.329
You think of Adam and Eve in the act of profound arrogance.

00:33:08.329 --> 00:33:12.329
They wanted to put themselves in God's place.

00:33:13.329 --> 00:33:15.329
They seemed to forget who they were.

00:33:15.329 --> 00:33:19.329
Creatures made of dust.

00:33:19.329 --> 00:33:24.329
So we all have to fight against prideful tendencies.

00:33:24.329 --> 00:33:27.329
Humility is elusive.

00:33:27.329 --> 00:33:31.329
As soon as we think we are humble, we've lost it.

00:33:31.329 --> 00:33:34.329
However, Jehovah gives us help.

00:33:34.329 --> 00:33:37.329
In the Bible, there are many examples of those

00:33:37.329 --> 00:33:39.329
who did maintain humility.

00:33:39.329 --> 00:33:42.329
And one of these is David.

00:33:42.329 --> 00:33:46.329
Let's just follow David's life a bit.

00:33:46.329 --> 00:33:48.329
Different stages of his life.

00:33:48.329 --> 00:33:51.329
And see, did he maintain humility?

00:33:51.329 --> 00:33:55.329
Well, was he humble as a young man?

00:33:55.329 --> 00:33:59.329
You remember how Jehovah directed the prophet Samuel

00:33:59.329 --> 00:34:03.329
to go to Jesse's house and annoyed one of Jesse's sons

00:34:03.329 --> 00:34:06.329
as the future king of Israel?

00:34:06.329 --> 00:34:10.329
Well, seven of his sons were there,

00:34:10.329 --> 00:34:13.329
but not one of them was chosen.

00:34:13.329 --> 00:34:15.329
And finally, Samuel said,

00:34:15.329 --> 00:34:17.329
are these all your sons?

00:34:17.329 --> 00:34:20.329
No, there's David out in the fields,

00:34:20.329 --> 00:34:23.329
shepherding the sheep.

00:34:23.329 --> 00:34:25.329
So they call David.

00:34:25.329 --> 00:34:28.329
And Samuel anoints this young man

00:34:28.329 --> 00:34:33.639
to be the future king of Israel.

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:35.639
David must have been surprised

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:39.639
at the singular privilege that he had.

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:43.639
Now, did he become high-minded?

00:34:43.639 --> 00:34:48.639
How would he have treated his brothers, his older brothers?

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:51.639
Had he become prideful?

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:55.639
Well, he could have said to a lieab,

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:59.639
well, I guess you've got taken down a peg or two, didn't you?

00:34:59.639 --> 00:35:02.639
You better start respecting me.

00:35:02.639 --> 00:35:06.639
And Abinadab, isn't it time for you to go out now

00:35:06.639 --> 00:35:08.639
and shepherd the sheep?

00:35:08.639 --> 00:35:11.639
I have a more important assignment.

00:35:11.639 --> 00:35:14.639
I have to learn to be king.

00:35:14.639 --> 00:35:18.639
How can I get into the king's court?

00:35:18.639 --> 00:35:23.639
No, nothing indicates David felt that way about himself.

00:35:23.639 --> 00:35:27.639
He was content to wait on Jehovah for future privileges.

00:35:27.639 --> 00:35:30.639
Is there a lesson here for us?

00:35:30.639 --> 00:35:33.639
Yes, you may get future privileges,

00:35:33.639 --> 00:35:35.639
but you may have to wait for them.

00:35:35.639 --> 00:35:40.639
Go back to your pastures, shepherd the sheep.

00:35:40.639 --> 00:35:43.639
So after some time, David is still in the pastures

00:35:43.639 --> 00:35:45.639
and what happens?

00:35:45.639 --> 00:35:52.639
An attendant of king Saul recommends a David serve in the king's court.

00:35:52.639 --> 00:35:58.639
Listen to this recommendation in 1 Samuel 1618.

00:35:58.639 --> 00:36:04.099
One of the attendants said,

00:36:04.099 --> 00:36:09.099
look, I have seen how a son of Jesse, the Bethlehemite,

00:36:09.099 --> 00:36:14.099
plays skillfully, and he is a courageous mighty warrior,

00:36:14.099 --> 00:36:17.099
and he can speak well, and he is handsome,

00:36:17.099 --> 00:36:20.099
and Jehovah is with him.

00:36:20.099 --> 00:36:24.099
My, what an impressive recommendation.

00:36:24.099 --> 00:36:29.099
So humble David goes from the sheepfold to the king's court

00:36:29.099 --> 00:36:32.099
as a court musician.

00:36:32.099 --> 00:36:35.099
The more privileges followed, you'll see in verse 21,

00:36:35.099 --> 00:36:38.099
B, he became Saul's armor bearer,

00:36:38.099 --> 00:36:43.099
and later David had many exploits in war.

00:36:43.099 --> 00:36:48.099
He became famous, women sang about his victories.

00:36:48.099 --> 00:36:53.099
So, fame, good looks, youth, eloquence,

00:36:53.099 --> 00:36:57.099
musical skills, military prowess, divine favor.

00:36:57.099 --> 00:37:00.099
David had it all, didn't he?

00:37:00.099 --> 00:37:04.099
And any one of those things could have made him arrogant and prideful,

00:37:04.099 --> 00:37:08.099
but it seems that they did not.

00:37:08.099 --> 00:37:14.099
Note David's reaction when King Saul offered David his daughter in marriage

00:37:14.099 --> 00:37:20.619
that is in 1 Samuel 1818.

00:37:20.619 --> 00:37:24.619
At this, David said to Saul, who am I?

00:37:24.619 --> 00:37:26.619
And who are my relatives?

00:37:26.619 --> 00:37:28.619
How there's family in Israel.

00:37:28.619 --> 00:37:32.619
For me to become son-in-law to the king.

00:37:32.619 --> 00:37:35.619
Yes, being related to the king

00:37:35.619 --> 00:37:38.619
might have given David a reason to boast,

00:37:38.619 --> 00:37:41.619
but his words, who am I?

00:37:41.619 --> 00:37:43.619
Resonate with us.

00:37:43.619 --> 00:37:47.619
David felt unworthy of being related to the king.

00:37:47.619 --> 00:37:50.619
Is there a lesson perhaps in this for us?

00:37:50.619 --> 00:37:53.619
Well, we may work with and come into contact

00:37:53.619 --> 00:37:58.619
with prominent brothers in God's organization.

00:37:58.619 --> 00:38:02.619
In conversations with others, do we drop their names,

00:38:02.619 --> 00:38:07.619
trying to make ourselves perhaps seem more important?

00:38:07.619 --> 00:38:12.619
But now we come to another period in David's life.

00:38:12.619 --> 00:38:16.619
He's now the king of Israel with his capital in Jerusalem,

00:38:16.619 --> 00:38:20.619
and he's dwelling in a royal palace,

00:38:20.619 --> 00:38:24.619
and he's feeling very embarrassed.

00:38:24.619 --> 00:38:27.619
Because here he is in a royal palace,

00:38:27.619 --> 00:38:31.619
and the Ark of Jehovah, who is the real king of Israel,

00:38:31.619 --> 00:38:33.619
is in a tent.

00:38:33.619 --> 00:38:37.619
And so he says to the prophet Nathan,

00:38:37.619 --> 00:38:42.619
I want to build Jehovah a worthy house, a temple,

00:38:42.619 --> 00:38:45.619
but Jehovah says, no, not you,

00:38:45.619 --> 00:38:47.619
but one of your sons would do that.

00:38:47.619 --> 00:38:51.619
However, then Jehovah did something

00:38:51.619 --> 00:38:56.619
that took David completely by surprise.

00:38:56.619 --> 00:39:00.619
God tells him, instead of you building me a house,

00:39:00.619 --> 00:39:04.619
I am going to build a house for you,

00:39:04.619 --> 00:39:08.619
and he makes a covenant with David so that the kingship

00:39:08.619 --> 00:39:13.619
would remain in the family line of David forever.

00:39:13.619 --> 00:39:17.940
Well, how did David react?

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:24.940
Please open to 1 Chronicles 17, 16 through 18.

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:28.940
At that King David came in and sat down before Jehovah

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:32.940
and said, who am I, O Jehovah God?

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:36.940
And what is my house that you have brought me this far?

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:39.940
As if this were not enough of God,

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:42.940
you also speak about the house of your servant,

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:44.940
down to a distant future time,

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:48.940
and you've looked on me as if I were a man

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:52.940
who should be further exalted, O Jehovah God.

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:55.940
What more can your servant David say to you

00:39:55.940 --> 00:40:01.940
about the honor given me when you know your servant so well?

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:05.940
So this marvelous promise that Jehovah made to David

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:07.940
touches his heart,

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:12.940
and he sits before Jehovah in humility,

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:17.940
feeling so unworthy and insignificant.

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:21.940
And later, David made an enormous contribution

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:23.940
for the building of the temple

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:30.940
that by today's standards would amount to over $1,200,000,000,

00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:32.940
but in prayer to Jehovah,

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:36.940
he says, as recorded in 1 Chronicles 29,14,

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:40.940
and yet, who am I,

00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:42.940
for everything is from you,

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:47.940
and what we have given to you comes from your own hand.

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:49.940
What a humble spirit,

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:51.940
and it's true, isn't it?

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:53.940
Whatever we give to Jehovah,

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:57.940
it's something that he has already given to us.

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:02.940
It's no wonder that Jehovah God loved David.

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:07.940
He was a man really agreeable to God's own heart.

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:12.940
How can we cultivate and maintain such a humble heart?

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:14.940
It's not simply by saying,

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:17.940
I am determined to be humble.

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:20.940
No, but do as David did.

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:22.940
Once in a while,

00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:25.940
sit down, take a long look at your life,

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:27.940
and see what blessings,

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:32.940
what undeserved kindnesses Jehovah has extended to you.

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:35.940
Ponder over his awesomeness.

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:37.940
And when we do so,

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:39.940
we will be moved to say to Jehovah,

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:42.940
who am I, Jehovah God,

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:43.940
that you've honored me,

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:46.940
making me one of your fellow workers,

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:48.940
despite my many flaws?

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:50.940
Who am I, Jehovah,

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:53.940
that you've given me health and strength

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:56.940
to serve in my assignment?

00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:58.940
Who am I, old God,

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:00.940
to have this special privilege of service?

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:01.940
When I know,

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:04.940
there are many more more deserving than I.

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:06.940
Of course,

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:08.940
there is a wholesome pride

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:11.940
in having the privilege of being one of God's servants,

00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:14.940
but it is an unhealthy pride

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:17.940
that makes one feel superior.

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:19.940
And if we're looking down on others,

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:22.940
we cannot be looking up at Jehovah.

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:24.940
And that really is the secret

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:27.940
of maintaining humility.

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:30.940
To know what we really are,

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:34.940
we always keep Jehovah before us as David did.

00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:36.940
So students,

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:38.940
we have every confidence

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:41.940
that you will keep your eyes on your awesome God,

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:43.940
and that he will use you,

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:45.940
and he will bless you even more

00:42:45.940 --> 00:43:03.980
than he has on this day of your graduation.

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:05.980
Well, I don't know about you,

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:07.980
but I was enlightened

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:09.980
by who am I, old Jehovah God.

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:13.980
That was David that said that.

00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:14.980
Oh, yeah.

00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:16.980
Believe it or not.

00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:18.980
Brother James Cauthan,

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:20.980
one of our Theocratic School instructors

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:22.980
will speak on the theme,

00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:27.289
sympathetic strings.

00:43:27.289 --> 00:43:29.289
Imagine that you had the means

00:43:29.289 --> 00:43:33.289
to give everyone in your life

00:43:33.289 --> 00:43:35.289
an expensive gift.

00:43:35.289 --> 00:43:37.289
You know what would happen?

00:43:37.289 --> 00:43:39.289
They would be happy.

00:43:39.289 --> 00:43:41.289
You would be happier.

00:43:41.289 --> 00:43:43.289
Because you would experience what Jesus said

00:43:43.289 --> 00:43:46.289
is a greater happiness of giving.

00:43:46.289 --> 00:43:50.920
Actually, you can give others

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:53.920
something that is very special.

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:55.920
Something they really need

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:58.920
and it won't cost you a cent.

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:00.920
What is it?

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:02.920
It's your attention.

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:06.920
Romans 12 and verse 15,

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:09.920
you also Paul wrote this.

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:12.920
He said, rejoice with those who rejoice.

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:15.920
Weep with those who weep.

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:17.920
We need to learn to understand and share

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:19.920
another person's feelings

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:21.920
whether it's joy or sadness,

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.920
but why?

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:24.920
We need to understand it

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:26.920
because we're living in critical times,

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:28.920
hard to deal with.

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:30.920
And so when the Bible says

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:32.920
to weep with those who weep,

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:35.920
we can sum that up in two words,

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:37.920
show sympathy.

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.920
Why should we do that?

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:42.920
We're going back to Romans 12

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:44.920
and this time in verse 5,

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:48.920
notice what we're reminded of.

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:50.920
Paul wrote, so we,

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:52.920
although many, are one body

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:53.920
and union with Christ,

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:54.920
but individually,

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:56.920
we are members belonging

00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:58.920
to one another.

00:44:58.920 --> 00:44:59.920
Now this, of course,

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:01.920
was written with those

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:03.920
in the New Covenant in mind,

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:04.920
but in reality,

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:07.920
all of us as Jehovah's people

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:09.920
belong to one another.

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:12.920
Now you might find it interesting to know

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:14.920
that in the Christian Greek scriptures,

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:16.920
there are some 50,

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:18.920
one another commands.

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:20.920
Love one another,

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:22.920
encourage one another,

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:24.920
incite one another,

00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:25.920
pray for one another,

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:27.920
and other things.

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:29.920
The watchtower said this.

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:31.920
It said, we should be sensitive

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:33.920
to our pains and heartaches

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:35.920
of our brothers and sisters.

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.920
Often we can bring much relief

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.920
to fellow believers who are

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:41.920
suffering emotional pain

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:43.920
if we take time to listen to them

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:46.920
with a truly sympathetic gear.

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:49.920
Sympathy is entering in

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.920
and sharing in the pain of others.

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:54.920
Now sometimes in English,

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:56.920
we say empathy.

00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:58.920
It's also translated fellow feeling

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:00.920
or even feel pity.

00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:02.920
It's in times of crisis,

00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:03.920
grief, and doubt

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:06.920
when we need one another the most.

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:07.920
So how can we show

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:10.920
that we care the answer simple?

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:13.920
Listen sympathetically.

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:15.920
The effect can be likened

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:17.920
to the sympathetic strings

00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:19.920
that are used to enhance the sound

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:20.920
and harmony of certain

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:22.920
musical instruments.

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:32.280
Now all of these have

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:36.280
strings that are not played,

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:38.280
but they react to the strings

00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:39.280
that are struck

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:42.280
or plucked if you would.

00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:45.280
Thus they become sympathetic.

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:47.280
They produce a unique harmony.

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:49.280
It's a oneness really.

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:52.280
The effect of this is

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:55.280
something that is very special.

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.280
But now how this actually works

00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:59.280
can be demonstrated with use

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:01.280
of two tuning forks.

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:06.619
Notice the one reacts to being struck.

00:47:06.619 --> 00:47:08.619
The second,

00:47:08.619 --> 00:47:10.619
although not being struck,

00:47:10.619 --> 00:47:14.619
reacts to the feelings of the first.

00:47:14.619 --> 00:47:17.619
So the first fork is no longer alone.

00:47:17.619 --> 00:47:20.619
It has become joined by a second fork

00:47:20.619 --> 00:47:23.619
that is now also picking up the vibrations

00:47:23.619 --> 00:47:26.619
and is said to be sympathetic.

00:47:26.619 --> 00:47:28.619
It's a harmony really.

00:47:28.619 --> 00:47:30.619
After the loss of loved one,

00:47:30.619 --> 00:47:32.619
one sister said,

00:47:32.619 --> 00:47:35.619
tears became the language of my heart.

00:47:35.619 --> 00:47:37.619
I so appreciated it

00:47:37.619 --> 00:47:38.619
when the friends came over

00:47:38.619 --> 00:47:40.619
and just cried with me.

00:47:40.619 --> 00:47:42.940
Sure.

00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:45.940
It's a oneness, a harmony.

00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:47.940
She felt it.

00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:50.940
We recognize so that there is a certain caution here.

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:54.940
Because sharing joy is one thing,

00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:58.940
but sympathetically listening to another's pain of heart

00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:02.940
can be emotionally taxing and time consuming.

00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:09.940
As our illustration demonstrates,

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:12.940
even after the original fork is removed,

00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:16.940
the one sympathetic is still feeling the effects.

00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:18.940
Isn't that right?

00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:20.940
And that's why,

00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:22.940
whether we like it or not,

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:25.940
our actions will reveal what's really in our hearts

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:28.940
when it comes to our brothers and sisters.

00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:30.940
Going back to Romans again,

00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:32.940
this time, Romans chapter 12,

00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:34.940
and verse 10,

00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:36.940
we're reminded of this.

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:37.940
It says,

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:38.940
in brotherly love,

00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:42.940
have tender affection for one another.

00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:47.940
Listening is a simple gesture of affection.

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:49.940
Often the problem, of course,

00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:51.940
is that we're in such a hurry to fix things

00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:54.940
that we feel that we can't take the time

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:56.940
to listen to someone else

00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:58.940
or just sympathize with them.

00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:01.940
Or sometimes we're so preoccupied

00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:03.940
with our own hurts

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:06.940
that we're caught up in that.

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:11.940
But self-pity will smother sympathy for others.

00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:14.940
And we need to be careful, frankly,

00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:16.940
because sometimes we feel

00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:18.940
that we just have to solve the problem right away.

00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:20.940
So we make statements

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:25.940
that are not helpful to the person that is suffering.

00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:26.940
You know,

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:28.940
you need to just toughen up.

00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:33.659
Or here's one of my favorites.

00:49:33.659 --> 00:49:37.940
Other suffered, now it's your turn.

00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:40.940
Or comparisons.

00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:42.940
Well, at least you can walk.

00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:49.510
Well, we don't mean those things to be malicious.

00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:51.510
But how do they come across?

00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:55.510
You see, they come across as condescending.

00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:58.510
And it's another way of saying,

00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:00.510
I don't care.

00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:03.510
Or I don't care enough.

00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:07.510
Job tried 10 times

00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:10.510
to explain to his comforters his feelings.

00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:12.510
And finally, after the 10th time,

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:16.510
he said, oh, if someone would but listen to me.

00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:19.510
His hurt, his pain was enhanced

00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:23.510
because of his companion's failure to listen.

00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:25.510
How sad that is.

00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:28.510
Neither they need cared about Job,

00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:37.119
nor did they want to understand his feelings.

00:50:37.119 --> 00:50:43.579
They shut him down.

00:50:43.579 --> 00:50:47.579
Could we ever do the same thing or something similar?

00:50:47.579 --> 00:50:50.579
How sad that would be.

00:50:50.579 --> 00:50:53.579
To share in someone's grief and pain,

00:50:53.579 --> 00:50:55.579
you must be willing to listen.

00:50:55.579 --> 00:50:57.579
You must be willing to take the time

00:50:57.579 --> 00:51:00.579
and you must care more about them than you do yourself.

00:51:00.579 --> 00:51:04.579
We need to learn to take ourself out of the equation.

00:51:04.579 --> 00:51:07.579
Romans 1210 continues

00:51:07.579 --> 00:51:11.579
to join honor to one another, take the lead.

00:51:11.579 --> 00:51:14.579
We honor others by being nonjudgmental,

00:51:14.579 --> 00:51:16.579
by taking them seriously

00:51:16.579 --> 00:51:19.579
and by giving sincere heartfelt attention

00:51:19.579 --> 00:51:24.579
and consideration to their words and their feelings.

00:51:24.579 --> 00:51:27.920
We need to remember this point.

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:31.920
That is that our relationship with God

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:34.920
and our relationship with our brothers

00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:37.920
is one and the same.

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:40.920
Jehovah cares deeply about how we interact with one another.

00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:44.920
Jehovah wants his people to be known for their love

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:47.920
for one another, more than anything else.

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:52.389
So your gift of sympathetic concern

00:51:52.389 --> 00:51:55.389
will be a powerful means of showing love

00:51:55.389 --> 00:51:57.389
and restoring a measure of harmony

00:51:57.389 --> 00:52:00.389
into the lives of others.

00:52:00.389 --> 00:52:03.389
We need to learn to take the lead.

00:52:03.389 --> 00:52:06.389
We need to learn to take the lead.

00:52:06.389 --> 00:52:29.909
This measure of harmony into the lives of others.

00:52:29.909 --> 00:52:36.289
It talks like that, I can see why I'm not one of the instructors.

00:52:36.289 --> 00:52:38.289
The illustration of the two forks,

00:52:38.289 --> 00:52:40.289
is drove the coin home, didn't it?

00:52:40.289 --> 00:52:42.289
Well, here's another.

00:52:42.289 --> 00:52:45.289
The glowing coal is the theme.

00:52:45.289 --> 00:52:48.289
Brother Mark Newmere has chosen.

00:52:48.289 --> 00:52:51.289
He's also one of the Theocratic School instructors

00:52:51.289 --> 00:52:54.289
and helper to the teaching committee to the Governor Body.

00:52:54.289 --> 00:52:59.889
we are burning with anticipation.

00:52:59.889 --> 00:53:05.889
On joyous occasions as today, your love burns strong.

00:53:05.889 --> 00:53:14.090
And rightly so, remember this day, etch indelibly in your minds how you feel right now because

00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:21.690
this love that is burning brightly within you will be tested.

00:53:21.690 --> 00:53:27.929
When we undergo trials, reviewing Bible accounts of faithful men and women can bolster

00:53:27.929 --> 00:53:35.090
our own faith, but we can hear their words ringing in our minds.

00:53:35.090 --> 00:53:41.929
But what about those who have never spoken a word recorded in the Bible?

00:53:41.929 --> 00:53:46.929
Can their silent examples of faith help us?

00:53:46.929 --> 00:53:48.809
Let's consider one.

00:53:48.809 --> 00:53:51.530
Her name is Rizba.

00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:53.570
We know very little about her.

00:53:53.570 --> 00:53:57.369
She is first introduced to us as a concubine of King Saul.

00:53:57.369 --> 00:54:02.090
No doubt she must have been very beautiful to catch the attention of the king.

00:54:02.090 --> 00:54:06.369
However, her life was not an easy one.

00:54:06.369 --> 00:54:10.809
In time, Saul, the father of her children, is killed in battle.

00:54:10.809 --> 00:54:14.369
She now becomes the property of Saul's son, Ishbo Sheth.

00:54:14.369 --> 00:54:16.969
He too is killed.

00:54:16.969 --> 00:54:25.170
Unfortunately, Rizba's most painful test was yet to come.

00:54:25.170 --> 00:54:30.530
Long after Saul's death, Jehovah tells King David that blood guilt remains on Saul's

00:54:30.530 --> 00:54:38.730
house due to his attempt to annihilate the Ghiblianites, which violated an ancient covenant.

00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:46.329
Thus the entire nation of Israel is guilty of shedding innocent blood.

00:54:46.409 --> 00:54:48.969
How does David resolve this issue?

00:54:48.969 --> 00:54:55.690
Second Samuel, chapter 21, and verse 3, shows what David did.

00:54:55.690 --> 00:55:02.730
Second Samuel, 21, 3, David asks the Ghiblianites, what should I do for you?

00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:09.570
Verse 6, they answer, let seven of Saul's sons be given to us, will hang their dead bodies

00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:11.969
before Jehovah.

00:55:11.969 --> 00:55:16.289
Verse 6 continues, David said, I will hand them over.

00:55:16.329 --> 00:55:18.329
Who does David hand over?

00:55:18.329 --> 00:55:24.409
He hands over in verse 8, Rizba's two sons.

00:55:24.409 --> 00:55:30.090
The two sons of Rizba, the two people in the whole world that she loved most, what a

00:55:30.090 --> 00:55:33.130
heartbreaking tragedy for Rizba.

00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:35.289
But she could do nothing about it.

00:55:35.289 --> 00:55:36.769
The decision was made.

00:55:36.769 --> 00:55:39.769
It was out of her control.

00:55:39.769 --> 00:55:43.050
Eventually, all seven men are hung.

00:55:43.090 --> 00:55:48.130
Now under the Mosaic law, those executed upon a stake, they should have been taken down

00:55:48.130 --> 00:55:50.570
before nightfall and buried.

00:55:50.570 --> 00:55:56.769
Burial would have brought closure to this mother's cross-soul, and above all, it would conform

00:55:56.769 --> 00:56:01.130
to Jehovah's requirements for the dignity of life.

00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:06.809
And that proper disposal of the dead body would have been according to Jehovah's instructions.

00:56:06.809 --> 00:56:11.289
Undoubtedly, Rizba knows this.

00:56:11.409 --> 00:56:14.289
But it didn't happen that way.

00:56:14.289 --> 00:56:21.489
So can you feel her anguish as night approaches and no one comes to take those bodies down?

00:56:21.489 --> 00:56:26.849
And Rizba could have been thinking, but the Mosaic law, no one is following the law.

00:56:26.849 --> 00:56:29.369
It's not right.

00:56:29.369 --> 00:56:31.889
But there was a catch.

00:56:31.889 --> 00:56:37.610
It seems that the Ghibinites were allowed to follow a different procedure in this instance

00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:43.449
because the national sin had been committed by King Saul.

00:56:43.449 --> 00:56:45.369
Now did Rizba know that?

00:56:45.369 --> 00:56:46.889
We don't know.

00:56:46.889 --> 00:56:51.530
But what we do know, one day goes by, the laws not followed.

00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:54.489
The bodies are not taken down.

00:56:54.489 --> 00:56:56.849
Two days go by.

00:56:56.849 --> 00:56:59.329
Three days go by.

00:56:59.329 --> 00:57:01.050
What does she do?

00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:07.090
Well according to verse 10, Rizba continues day after day in the blaze of that scorching

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:08.690
summer sun.

00:57:08.690 --> 00:57:11.889
In fact, verse 10 says what she did do.

00:57:11.889 --> 00:57:17.690
It says that she didn't allow the birds of the heavens to land on those bodies by day,

00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:21.449
nor the wild beasts of the field to come near by night.

00:57:21.449 --> 00:57:26.530
There she was out there day after day, shewing those birds away.

00:57:26.530 --> 00:57:33.289
Not to draw attention to herself, not to get justice for her sons, no, she understood.

00:57:33.289 --> 00:57:39.849
She appreciated and she upheld Jehovah's view of human life.

00:57:39.849 --> 00:57:47.329
She allowed Jehovah's values to shape her behavior even at great personal cost.

00:57:47.329 --> 00:57:49.849
Must love this woman.

00:57:49.849 --> 00:57:54.969
Although Rizba probably didn't understand exactly why things were happening this way,

00:57:54.969 --> 00:57:57.289
why was it turning out in this way?

00:57:57.289 --> 00:58:03.929
This different procedure of not burying her sons had a major impact on her personal

00:58:03.929 --> 00:58:05.769
life.

00:58:05.769 --> 00:58:13.250
Yet her conduct showed her love for Jehovah and the loyalty that she had for his arrangements

00:58:13.250 --> 00:58:17.969
that this love and loyalty burned brightly within her.

00:58:17.969 --> 00:58:19.610
Here's your big lesson.

00:58:19.610 --> 00:58:26.929
Now at times, you might feel that your life is outside of your control.

00:58:26.929 --> 00:58:33.969
You may go through a trial that allows Jehovah's standards and decisions to shape you,

00:58:33.969 --> 00:58:38.050
perhaps at great personal cost.

00:58:38.050 --> 00:58:43.889
For example, you're familiar with theocratic procedure, you're familiar with theocratic

00:58:43.889 --> 00:58:46.690
policies, we know that.

00:58:46.690 --> 00:58:52.250
But there might come a time when an organizational direction, an organizational procedure is

00:58:52.250 --> 00:59:02.530
modified for reasons that you are not fully aware of, and that decision affects you personally.

00:59:02.530 --> 00:59:04.369
What will you do?

00:59:04.369 --> 00:59:09.809
Like Rizba, keep doing what you can under your circumstances, show those birds away, those

00:59:09.809 --> 00:59:16.289
negative thoughts, stir up that fire, don't allow your warmth and glow for Jehovah God to

00:59:16.289 --> 00:59:18.570
burn out.

00:59:18.570 --> 00:59:27.690
Now days go by, according to verse 9 and verse 10, from the start of the harvest to the

00:59:27.690 --> 00:59:29.690
rain.

00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:34.969
Now this implies this may have been five to six months that she kept vigil over her son's

00:59:34.969 --> 00:59:36.809
bodies.

00:59:36.809 --> 00:59:41.610
What could she have been thinking about during this time that may have been close to a half

00:59:41.610 --> 00:59:42.610
a year?

00:59:42.610 --> 00:59:45.530
What would she have been thinking about?

00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:52.050
How could David be so uncareing as not to command to give my boys a proper burial?

00:59:52.050 --> 00:59:59.369
And Jehovah, after all that I've been through, where are you, Jehovah?

00:59:59.369 --> 01:00:05.289
Now these might have been natural thoughts, true, yet if she did have them, she did

01:00:05.289 --> 01:00:13.130
not allow these thoughts to put out the fire of her love for God or to make her bitter.

01:00:13.690 --> 01:00:18.650
Perhaps others even tried to discourage her saying, go home, give up.

01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:20.449
But she didn't.

01:00:20.449 --> 01:00:24.650
Nor did she start a campaign by gathering others to her side.

01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:30.929
There's no record of her bad mouthing, David criticizing his decision as unfair.

01:00:30.929 --> 01:00:33.170
Nor did she presume to take the bodies down herself.

01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:36.530
Well, if nobody's going to do it, I'll do it.

01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:37.530
No.

01:00:37.530 --> 01:00:42.690
In spite of all of these difficulties, imagine that Rizba was suffering.

01:00:42.690 --> 01:00:48.690
She still had embers of love for Jehovah God glowing brightly.

01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:58.849
That moved her to stay loyal, remain in her place, and wait on David to make the decision.

01:00:58.849 --> 01:01:03.809
Did her faithful endurance really matter?

01:01:03.809 --> 01:01:07.809
Did anyone notice her plight?

01:01:07.809 --> 01:01:10.730
Verse 11.

01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:15.929
It was told what Saul's concubine, Rizba, had done.

01:01:15.929 --> 01:01:20.409
So imagine, someone goes to David, David, there's this Rizba, she's up there near these

01:01:20.409 --> 01:01:23.929
bodies, she's chewing these birds away.

01:01:23.929 --> 01:01:26.170
So what did David do?

01:01:26.170 --> 01:01:31.170
Did he now finally give Rizba's sons a decent burial?

01:01:31.170 --> 01:01:35.409
Actually, he did more.

01:01:35.409 --> 01:01:42.210
His 12 through 14 show how David had the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan brought

01:01:42.210 --> 01:01:48.090
all the way from J. Besh-Gilid, which might have taken a journey of about 100 miles and

01:01:48.090 --> 01:01:56.130
buried those bones with the bones of Rizba's sons and Saul's family plot in Benjamite territory.

01:01:56.130 --> 01:02:01.929
So in the end, Rizba got more than she expected.

01:02:01.929 --> 01:02:08.449
She saw the bones of her sons and their father buried together.

01:02:08.449 --> 01:02:14.489
Rizba didn't see that coming, but it was worth the wait.

01:02:14.489 --> 01:02:18.809
So what's the big lesson we want you to remember here?

01:02:18.809 --> 01:02:25.449
Rizba's love and loyalty and endurance provides an example worth imitating.

01:02:25.449 --> 01:02:31.889
When you go through a trial, remember that others are observing your conduct.

01:02:31.889 --> 01:02:33.929
They're watching.

01:02:33.929 --> 01:02:40.570
And out of frustration, you might feel, well, why haven't the elders done anything?

01:02:40.570 --> 01:02:43.769
Why aren't the overseers taking care of this situation?

01:02:43.769 --> 01:02:47.849
Jehovah, why don't you do something?

01:02:47.849 --> 01:02:51.849
And Jehovah is saying, I am doing something.

01:02:51.849 --> 01:03:00.449
I'm using your silent example to show others that when you endure a situation, I will reward

01:03:00.449 --> 01:03:01.449
them.

01:03:01.449 --> 01:03:04.570
I will reward them more than they ever anticipated.

01:03:04.570 --> 01:03:11.369
And it will be worth the wait because I, Jehovah, I love being a rewarder.

01:03:11.369 --> 01:03:18.130
What a noble and honorable way to be used by Jehovah God.

01:03:18.130 --> 01:03:22.530
Now Rizba was not a victim of her circumstances.

01:03:22.530 --> 01:03:28.210
Rather, she became a victor over her adversities.

01:03:28.210 --> 01:03:33.809
The intense heat of her trials did not break her as a person, nor crush her desire to

01:03:33.809 --> 01:03:37.210
please Jehovah God.

01:03:37.210 --> 01:03:43.969
So little is known about her, and yet we learn so much from her.

01:03:43.969 --> 01:03:50.050
She never had one spoken word recorded in the Bible, yet Jehovah must have been very

01:03:50.050 --> 01:03:56.570
impressed with this remarkable woman, her name, an example, earned a place in his sacred

01:03:56.570 --> 01:03:59.730
book and is worthy of our examination.

01:03:59.730 --> 01:04:07.369
She teaches you, she teaches you how to take life's indignities with dignity.

01:04:07.369 --> 01:04:11.769
So what helped her endure successfully?

01:04:11.769 --> 01:04:15.570
Perhaps a clue is in her name.

01:04:15.570 --> 01:04:19.809
It literally means glowing coal.

01:04:19.809 --> 01:04:24.690
Now we don't know why she was given that name, true, but like a piece of coal glowing

01:04:24.769 --> 01:04:30.690
warm and bright, Rizba kept her thoughts focused on love for her son's loyalty to Jehovah,

01:04:30.690 --> 01:04:36.849
loyalty to his arrangements, confident that relief would eventually come.

01:04:36.849 --> 01:04:38.610
She was industrious.

01:04:38.610 --> 01:04:43.050
She actively guarded her son's bodies from being eaten by animals.

01:04:43.050 --> 01:04:48.769
She didn't allow negative feelings to shut her down and extinguish her love.

01:04:48.769 --> 01:04:54.809
Rather, in the face of what she might have felt to be an injustice, she did what she

01:04:54.809 --> 01:04:56.610
could.

01:04:56.610 --> 01:04:58.090
So what do we want you to remember?

01:04:58.090 --> 01:05:03.409
What do we want you to go away with to your assignments thinking about?

01:05:03.409 --> 01:05:08.250
In the face of a perceived injustice, keep working.

01:05:08.250 --> 01:05:10.849
Keep carrying out your assigned work assignments.

01:05:10.849 --> 01:05:12.610
Keep doing what you can.

01:05:12.610 --> 01:05:14.050
Shoe away those birds.

01:05:14.050 --> 01:05:18.849
Look up the fire of your love for Jehovah God and the brothers.

01:05:18.849 --> 01:05:26.530
And wait on Jehovah to resolve any pending issues, confident that relief will come now

01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:27.929
or in the new world.

01:05:27.929 --> 01:05:31.010
It will be worth that wait.

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:36.849
And yet above all, above all, be a Rizba.

01:05:36.849 --> 01:05:49.260
Under all circumstances keep your love for God burning brightly like a glowing coal.

01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:54.139
Those talks were inspiring to the students of the 143rd class.

01:05:54.139 --> 01:05:58.340
And I'm sure that you feel much the same way after viewing them.

01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:02.300
But you probably are wondering, what about the rest of the program?

01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:03.780
Wonder no longer.

01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:10.059
Part 2 and Part 3 will be posted on the video on demand section of JW Broadcasting later

01:06:10.059 --> 01:06:11.380
this month.

01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:16.340
In fact, Part 2 is a video entitled The Inside Story.

01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:19.739
It is scheduled to be posted next Monday, December 11.

01:06:19.739 --> 01:06:24.300
You will enjoy hearing experiences from some of the graduates of the class.

01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:29.179
Until the next monthly program, this is JW Broadcasting coming to you from the World

01:06:29.179 --> 01:06:31.219
Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses.
