00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:10.349
I had many questions, why do young people have to die?

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.349
Why do my children have to go through this?

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.350
God did not create us to make war.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.350
The priests in my church always said it is God's will.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.350
Being on the run was dreadful.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.350
More than once I thought we were going to die.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.350
Eventually we arrived in Germany

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.350
and I was convinced that the priests there

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.350
could give me some answers.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.350
I went to several different churches, but no answers.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.350
I kept telling them, I'm looking for something.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.350
I don't know what it is, but I didn't find it here with you.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.350
Sometimes I thought I was searching for something

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.350
that no one could give me.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.340
One day, a German woman approached me in Arabic.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.340
That was amazing for me.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.340
I never had a good opinion of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.340
I didn't think I could learn anything from her, but I gave her a chance.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.340
She gave me logical answers to all of my questions.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.930
In my home country, there are multiple religious groups

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.930
and nationalities who hate and fight each other.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.930
But at the meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.930
I have seen that all people can live in peace with each other.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.930
If they get to know our father in heaven,

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.930
he gives love and peace.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.930
At last, I found what I had been looking for.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:55.659
I lived a life without rules.

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.659
I used to get drunk, smoked a lot,

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.659
and I became a compulsive gambler.

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.659
My behavior was a complete disaster.

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.659
My wife wanted to separate from me.

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:13.659
It was a horrible time.

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:17.659
My wife started studying the Bible with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:22.659
I remember being doubtful, very doubtful.

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:27.659
But there was one thing that started to make me think.

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:34.659
Both my wife and my children look more peaceful, more joyful, happier.

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.659
That's why I even accepted a Bible study.

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:44.479
I came to realize that Jehovah lives each one of us as an individual.

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:48.479
That gave me real hope for the future.

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:51.479
Everything I was studying in the Bible helped me to understand

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:55.479
that doing Jehovah's will is in our best interest.

00:02:55.479 --> 00:03:01.500
This really helped me to quit my bad habits,

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.500
treat my family better,

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.500
and show due respect to my wife.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.500
If Jehovah hadn't searched for me,

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.500
if I hadn't come to know him,

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.500
we would no longer be a family.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.500
Today, we are indeed a happy family,

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.500
a united family, united more than ever.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:33.500
Only Jehovah could perform such a miracle.
