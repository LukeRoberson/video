00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:08.960
I was born in Congo, my family died, we had to flee, there was a wall going on.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:16.960
One thing I remember is the bombs and the shootings that were behind us as we were running.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.960
Here people screaming too, each day we live, each step we took,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.960
we knew that something was going to happen to adults, we never knew if we were going to survive.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:39.530
My mom and I were the only one who survived and that was one of the reasons we had to go to Luwanda.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:46.530
As someone who was raising the refugee camp, I can tell you that the life in the camp was not easy.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.530
The hardest part was just seeing people facing hunger.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.530
And since I never had a big brother to support me,

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.530
all these kids would come and beat me up, hitting me.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.530
I just felt like I was a victim, even though there was all this sadness,

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.530
I knew there was God out there who cares for people.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.530
So what I did was I started paying to God.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.530
Then I started going to the Catholic church to look for him.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.530
At the age of seven, I saw these two women,

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.530
because I came to know that they were witnesses.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.530
I was so inspired by their smile and these women had the Bible in their hands

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.530
and the track they gave me was about paradise.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.530
Now knowing that there is a hope, there is a hope for the future,

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.530
there is something good coming, knowing that there is a meaning of life.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.530
These brought me so much joy.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.530
Then I met this kid who went to his book.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.530
As I opened the book, there was a scripture from Exodus, chapter 20, verse 4.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.530
In that verse, it shows you must now worship any other gods.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.530
When I read these words, I was so shocked.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.530
I was so shocked.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.530
And more than I was so disappointed of myself,

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.530
because now I know that I was doing something wrong.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.530
I was now worshiping the true God.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.530
From there on, I left the Catholic church.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.530
I pray for the strength to go and to look for Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.530
to look for the Kingdom.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.530
Then later, I went to the meeting.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.530
I went to my first meeting, the unity among God's people.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.530
That really touched me.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.530
And then after that, everybody came and hugged me.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.530
Show me this love I never said before.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:48.530
And more than that, more than that, I went home knowing God's name is Jehovah.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.530
This name was so special.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.530
This name was just like full of strength and spirit.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.530
The moment I started using Jehovah's name,

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.530
the moment I started praying to Jehovah.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.530
He became so real to me.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.530
He became my big brother.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.530
He became more than a big brother.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.530
Because when I prayed the first time in Jehovah's name,

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.099
that day, like all those kids were beating me,

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.099
who were hitting me up, now wanted to be my friend.

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.099
And this was the day after I went to my first meeting.

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:33.580
Really, Jehovah put a wall between my enemies.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:40.580
Jehovah became my rescuer in that moment.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.580
And right here, I knew this is my God.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.580
And I was determined to never leave him.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.580
I was determined to serve him my whole life.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:59.280
In 2011, we ended up moving from Luwanda to the U.S.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.280
And I asked this lady if she knew Winnesys.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.280
And she said, yes, I know Winnesys.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.280
So then, from then on, she called them

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.280
and I was able to reunite with my brothers and sisters.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.280
In 2012, I got baptized.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.279
And now I was officially one of Jehovah's Winnesys,

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:19.279
one of Jehovah's people.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.279
So right after getting baptized,

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.279
more refugees kept coming in the country.

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:26.279
I knew what these refugees went through.

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:29.279
I knew they left their lives because they lived through their life.

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:34.279
Jehovah allowed me to be able to comfort these people.

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:37.279
Being in the darkness, it was so hard.

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:41.279
But now, for everything that Jehovah had done for me,

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:45.279
it just felt as if he pulled me out of this darkness.

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:47.279
Like, Son, come up.

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:49.279
He pulled me out of this darkness.

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:50.279
To the light.

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:54.779
You come to save Jehovah.

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:55.779
You rely on Jehovah.

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:57.779
You make Jehovah your salvation.

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:59.779
He show you who he is.
