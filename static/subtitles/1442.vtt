00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:08.439
On September 23, 2015, it was announced at all branches that the governing body was

00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:13.339
requesting all Bethel families to reduce in size.

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:19.339
For me personally, when they made that announcement on the Wednesday of September 23, that was exciting.

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:22.140
I knew it was momentous.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.539
When the announcement was made, tears rolled up in my eyes because I realized how close we are to the end.

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.739
And I remember just closing my eyes and saying to Jehovah, whatever you want will do.

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:36.740
When I received news of my reassignment, initially I was numb.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:43.140
When I got news about my reassignment, I was so scared at the beginning.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.939
Caught me off guard. I wasn't expecting it.

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:56.939
We were quite shocked and sad, but we were encouraged by the brothers at Bethel and also in the congregation.

00:00:56.939 --> 00:01:02.539
The direction from the governing body was where being reassigned as regular pioneers.

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.340
We signed the forms for pioneering that very Thursday.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:15.939
For me, I've always appreciated the scripture for Samuel 1222, where it states here for the sake of his great name Jehovah, not abandon his people.

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:23.140
I don't want to forget my Bethel time because it was lovely, but I want to stretch forward ahead to pioneering and really enjoy it.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:32.939
We pray specifically for a place that is going to help us to be as simple as possible so that we can forecast our attention to the ministry.

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:42.939
All that I'd love to say to everyone who has been reassigned is that Jehovah is our father and will never relinquish his responsibility as a father.

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:44.540
He will take care of us.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:52.939
We are losing four couples from our congregation and I would like to tell the congregation where they have been assigned to.

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:59.739
That they are getting real spiritual people and that they are really going to be an asset to their congregation.

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:10.740
I just want to also think the brothers in the congregation will be going to because they organize secular work for us and also as Bonnie mentioned accommodation.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.740
So they made it easy for us to look forward to our assignment.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.939
But we know this, of course, comes from Jehovah.

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:23.139
And so the Bronze Committee said, well, we have to move quickly with this.

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:29.139
We asked the family, please give us two, three weeks to work things out and that is what they appreciated.

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:35.740
Congregations, funding, the Bethelites were offered jobs, they were offered accommodation.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.139
Our congregation is delighted.

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:45.139
Having two young Bethelites coming in general, our congregation has quite a number of young people.

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:48.740
We can already see that it's going to benefit them quite a lot.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:57.539
We've actually assisted them in getting a place where they could stay and also assisted them to settle in and be part of the congregation.

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:00.939
Welcome to our new home. We've been here a little over a week now.

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:06.539
The brothers helped to paint their house, to put tiles on, to clean the entire place.

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:09.139
So they really did a lot of work in our behalf.

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:11.740
Also memories of our friends from Deva.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.939
It was about six months ago when we enjoyed Pioneer School.

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:18.340
Thanks to your brothers, we were able to find employment.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:26.340
Jehovah has been answering our prayers and sometimes he's been answering our concerns even before we even pray about it.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:33.340
No doubt these extraordinary experiences in South Africa are mirrored all over the world.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.340
The love we show to each other is a reflection of Jehovah's great love for each of us.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.340
And we thank him to be part of this amazing brother.
