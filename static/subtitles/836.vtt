WEBVTT

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.179
We thought it might be a truck driving by.

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:32.179
When it happened again, we got up and started reading the news on the internet.

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:37.460
And we found out that there were explosions happening in all the cities.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.179
My mama woke from her sleep to sirens sounding all over the city.

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:49.179
Of course, we were very anxious and turned on the TV immediately.

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:52.179
But we didn't even have to look for information,

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:56.179
because all the channels were already talking about the fact that war had started.

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:00.179
We just immediately started praying to Jehovah,

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:04.180
calling friends and close ones and asking how they were

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.849
and waiting for guidance from the brothers.

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:12.849
At 5.30 a.m., a brother from CUBE called us

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:17.959
and said that the bombs were landing in CUBE.

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:22.959
We immediately got up, woke up the children,

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:24.959
and told them about the situation.

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:27.959
And we didn't let the children go to school.

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:31.959
We realized that our lives had changed.

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:35.459
We read the daily text,

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:39.459
but I want to note that this scripture is well known for us.

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:43.459
It used to be a year text, and of course we knew it.

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:46.459
But at that moment, it sounded special.

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:49.459
I mean, it was like personal guidance,

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:52.459
such a personal answer from Jehovah to everyone.

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:56.459
And I understood what I had to do.

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:00.459
In that day, brothers created a Zoom meeting

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:03.459
that ran for the whole day.

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:06.459
And brothers and sisters could connect via Zoom to preach,

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:10.460
talk to each other, and support each other.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.460
We were all together.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.460
Every day, it became more difficult.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.460
It became more difficult to deliver food,

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.379
and the food became more expensive.

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.379
We started to panic,

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:33.889
which led to panic buying of medicines

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:36.889
and basic staple products.

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:39.889
Yes, before that, during the pandemic,

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:41.889
for two years now,

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:43.889
brothers had been constantly reminding us

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.889
of the necessity of go-bags.

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:48.889
And then, closer to the war,

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:51.889
reminders also began to come from brothers

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:54.889
about not only stocking up on such backpacks,

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:57.889
but also about checking what condition they were in.

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:00.889
And it was also recommended to stock up on food

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:05.610
for two months in advance.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.610
When the war started, we were really frightened

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.610
because I was in my ninth month of pregnancy.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.610
And I could go into labor at any moment.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.610
We prayed a lot.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.610
We wanted to work out what to do next,

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.610
what the right thing for us to do was.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.610
We weren't sure what was going on

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.610
and how it would end.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.610
But when we heard that next to us,

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.610
they bombed a hospital

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.610
and they bombed a dormitory, we understood.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.610
We had to find a safer place.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.139
It was then that my husband made the decision

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.139
that we should go.

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.139
We couldn't leave because I wasn't able to travel,

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:53.139
even to transport me from one room to the other was a problem.

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:57.139
So the situation really was such that in our case,

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.139
it was very difficult to leave

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:02.139
and it was very hard to stay

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:06.139
because almost every day the area was being shell.

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:12.830
My dad isn't quite a difficult condition right now.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.829
He is completely blind with poor hearing.

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.829
He had a stroke

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.829
and broke his hip a few months ago.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.829
So now he is completely bedridden

00:04:25.829 --> 00:04:28.829
and requires constant care.

00:04:28.829 --> 00:04:30.829
Patia's mom is hard of hearing

00:04:30.829 --> 00:04:33.829
and she broke her arm.

00:04:33.829 --> 00:04:37.829
It is our duty to take care of our parents.

00:04:37.829 --> 00:04:40.829
It is a commandment that Jehovah gave

00:04:40.829 --> 00:04:46.829
but we did not know how we could do it in this situation.

00:04:46.829 --> 00:04:49.829
When the war started and the first days of it,

00:04:49.829 --> 00:04:53.829
my grandfather had a second stroke

00:04:53.829 --> 00:04:57.829
and worries about him were added to the situation.

00:04:58.829 --> 00:05:00.829
We had to take care of him

00:05:00.829 --> 00:05:03.829
because he could not eat.

00:05:03.829 --> 00:05:06.829
Only my mom, my older brother,

00:05:06.829 --> 00:05:10.829
my grandmother and I are Jehovah's Witnesses in our family.

00:05:10.829 --> 00:05:13.829
My dad was worried about my safety.

00:05:13.829 --> 00:05:16.829
We understood that out of our whole family,

00:05:16.829 --> 00:05:18.829
I was the only one you could leave.

00:05:18.829 --> 00:05:23.199
Before we left,

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.199
my husband called an elder from our congregation.

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:30.199
He and his wife were already in the west of Ukraine at the time

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:33.199
and they gave us a lot of advice.

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:36.199
They gave us advice on how to behave at roadblocks

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:38.199
that we should hide our phones

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:41.199
and not take photos of anything.

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:44.199
They were advising us on which villages to go through

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:47.199
because there were very big traffic jams at the time

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:51.199
and people were stopped in some traffic jams for 10 or 12 hours.

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:54.540
There were no lights.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.540
We drove large sections of the road in one go,

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.540
constantly praying that we wouldn't get a flat tire,

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.540
that the car wouldn't break down,

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.540
and that we wouldn't get stuck in a field.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:11.269
Before each checkpoint, we were so nervous

00:06:11.269 --> 00:06:16.480
because local militia, when drunk,

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.480
could be unpredictable.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.480
But since they had weapons,

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.480
combat weapons,

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.480
we were afraid not only of the invaders,

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.110
but the locals as well.

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.110
I don't think we ever prayed as much as we did

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.110
during those hours on the road.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.110
My husband tried to stay as calm as possible

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.459
and reassure me so that I wouldn't worry.

00:06:44.459 --> 00:06:52.589
A sister found out that there would be an evacuation train

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:55.589
and we kind of wanted to get on it,

00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:58.589
but we were not sure that we would.

00:06:58.589 --> 00:07:01.589
But this time, with prayers,

00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:04.589
she managed to organize the transportation

00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:07.589
and both our families went.

00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:10.589
It was amazing that this train had a special carriage

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:13.589
for people with disabilities,

00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:16.589
and we were taken to this carriage,

00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:20.589
and the train was even delayed until we sat down.

00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:23.589
They were waiting for us.

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:26.589
Before we left, we informed the elders

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:28.589
that we had made up our minds,

00:07:28.589 --> 00:07:30.589
and we were going.

00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:33.589
The brothers sent us a certain amount of money.

00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:35.589
They said,

00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:37.589
this is to help you.

00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:39.589
And when we boarded the train,

00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:42.589
we found out that we had to pay for the train.

00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:43.589
Although before that,

00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:46.589
all evacuation trains were free.

00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:48.589
They told us the amount for the tickets

00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:50.589
and it was exactly the same

00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:53.589
as what the brothers had given us.

00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:56.589
The only opportunity for me to leave

00:07:56.589 --> 00:07:59.589
was by evacuation train.

00:07:59.589 --> 00:08:03.589
Usually, a compartment is designed for four people.

00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:08.769
In ours, there were 13 of us.

00:08:08.769 --> 00:08:11.769
On the train, I was traveling with the family

00:08:11.769 --> 00:08:14.769
for my congregation.

00:08:14.769 --> 00:08:16.769
In order to reduce our worries

00:08:16.769 --> 00:08:18.769
and switch to something positive,

00:08:18.769 --> 00:08:21.769
we decided to take the opportunity

00:08:21.769 --> 00:08:25.769
and preach to the people.

00:08:25.769 --> 00:08:30.240
We drove for 16 hours,

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.549
and we arrived very late.

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:36.549
I believe a group of police approached

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:41.340
and took me to the security service of Ukraine.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.340
Since I have a Russian passport,

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:48.070
I'm essentially like an enemy to them.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.070
I knew that Jehovah was with Dad,

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.070
that he would protect him,

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:55.070
and that most likely he would not be dragged there

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:59.700
to prison or something like that.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:03.700
But I was worried that they might simply not let us go further,

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:10.059
and we would stay in Ukraine.

00:09:10.059 --> 00:09:14.059
That and waited. I prayed to Jehovah.

00:09:14.059 --> 00:09:17.059
And this helped me,

00:09:17.059 --> 00:09:20.059
not to focus on my negative thoughts,

00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:25.620
but to trust Jehovah completely.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.620
They begin to incite me to say such slogans as,

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.620
glory to Ukraine.

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:33.620
I answered,

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.620
I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.620
and we take a neutral position in this war.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.899
We do not support the Russian side,

00:09:41.899 --> 00:09:44.899
I also cannot glorify some other country,

00:09:44.899 --> 00:09:51.840
and then he told me to curse Putin.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.840
I said,

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.840
well, since I am a believer,

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.840
I cannot speak swear words,

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:03.659
so I cannot say this either.

00:10:03.659 --> 00:10:04.659
And the policeman said,

00:10:04.659 --> 00:10:07.659
yes, I know your people.

00:10:07.659 --> 00:10:09.659
They don't want to defend their homeland.

00:10:09.659 --> 00:10:10.659
I replied,

00:10:10.659 --> 00:10:12.659
well, if I were a conscript,

00:10:12.659 --> 00:10:14.659
I would fight against Ukraine now,

00:10:14.659 --> 00:10:16.659
since I am Russian.

00:10:16.659 --> 00:10:18.659
He said, well,

00:10:18.659 --> 00:10:20.659
then save your family.

00:10:20.659 --> 00:10:24.419
Go with God, Alexey.

00:10:24.419 --> 00:10:26.419
He gave me back my documents,

00:10:26.419 --> 00:10:28.419
and wished me a good journey.

00:10:28.419 --> 00:10:32.419
We waited at the border for about 17 hours.

00:10:32.419 --> 00:10:36.419
The difficulty was that it was very cold.

00:10:36.419 --> 00:10:38.419
The car got cold quickly,

00:10:38.419 --> 00:10:40.419
and there were no toilets.

00:10:40.419 --> 00:10:43.419
As it was our turn to be checked,

00:10:43.419 --> 00:10:45.419
we spoke to the female border guard

00:10:45.419 --> 00:10:48.419
and explained to her that I could go into labor at any time,

00:10:48.419 --> 00:10:51.419
and that I really needed my husband's help.

00:10:51.419 --> 00:10:54.419
I couldn't even carry my own bag.

00:10:54.419 --> 00:10:56.419
Then she told me that if I wanted,

00:10:56.419 --> 00:10:58.419
I could stay in Ukraine,

00:10:58.419 --> 00:11:00.419
but there was no way my husband

00:11:00.419 --> 00:11:10.970
would be allowed to leave.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.970
Our final destination was the city of Helm in Poland,

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:16.970
where we arrived.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:18.970
And there was an outburst of emotions

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:22.970
when the volunteers quickly brought us to the sisters,

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.970
and we saw this JW.org sign.

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:28.970
There were so many emotions.

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:30.970
That is, well,

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:32.970
it took our breath away,

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:34.970
and we just couldn't speak.

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:36.970
And now, indeed,

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:40.970
this was the moment when we understood that this is it.

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:42.970
We were saved.

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:49.070
When we arrived at the Kingdom Hall,

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:54.250
we were feeling really emotional.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.250
We were very worried and nervous about what was going to happen.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.250
But once we entered the Kingdom Hall,

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:03.250
we were able to calm down.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:06.250
There were a lot of local brothers and sisters

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:08.250
who greeted us with hugs.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:10.250
Many even had tears in their eyes

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:13.250
when they saw that I was going to have a baby soon.

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:15.250
At that moment,

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.250
we realized that Jehovah and our brotherhood

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:21.250
will take care of us as their own family,

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:24.250
and whatever circumstances we find ourselves.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:28.419
I sat in the Kingdom Hall

00:12:28.419 --> 00:12:30.419
and didn't know what to plan next.

00:12:30.419 --> 00:12:32.419
The elder who was on shift at the Kingdom Hall

00:12:32.419 --> 00:12:34.419
took time for me,

00:12:34.419 --> 00:12:36.419
and he encouraged me very much.

00:12:36.419 --> 00:12:38.419
He acknowledged everything I had gone through

00:12:38.419 --> 00:12:40.419
and comforted me,

00:12:40.419 --> 00:12:42.419
letting me know that I was now safe.

00:12:42.419 --> 00:12:45.419
He assured me that Jehovah is with me,

00:12:45.419 --> 00:12:47.419
and will continue to support me

00:12:47.419 --> 00:12:49.419
and that I have no reason to fear.

00:12:49.419 --> 00:12:51.419
I remember a moment

00:12:51.419 --> 00:12:53.419
when I went outside in the evening

00:12:53.419 --> 00:12:55.419
in the view of the Carpathian Mountains

00:12:55.419 --> 00:12:57.419
opened up to me.

00:12:57.419 --> 00:12:59.419
The birds were singing.

00:12:59.419 --> 00:13:01.419
It strengthened me so much.

00:13:01.419 --> 00:13:03.419
I remember the thought

00:13:03.419 --> 00:13:06.419
where a brother said that if Jehovah created all this,

00:13:06.419 --> 00:13:08.419
won't he help you?

00:13:08.419 --> 00:13:11.899
And while later I felt that power on myself

00:13:11.899 --> 00:13:14.899
when everything began to resolve so quickly,

00:13:14.899 --> 00:13:18.899
and I didn't even think that it would resolve that way.

00:13:18.899 --> 00:13:24.720
My biggest fear is probably the fear of the unknown,

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.720
but now we see that there is nothing to be afraid of.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:31.220
There was a disaster relief committee

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.220
that helped to accommodate refugees,

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:38.240
and the sisters working with the committee

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.240
were looking for routes,

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.240
and looking for transport,

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.240
buses, trains,

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.240
and planes.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.240
We were accommodated with an amazing family

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.240
where we felt really comfortable.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.240
We felt completely understood.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:00.240
It is simply incredible

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:06.240
Of course, Jehovah has accompanied us all these years.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.240
All these years we have been feeling his help.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.240
But now it is just like an avalanche,

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.240
an avalanche of miracles, help, and support.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:20.649
Different brothers and sisters began to visit us straight away

00:14:20.649 --> 00:14:22.649
and each time there was someone new,

00:14:22.649 --> 00:14:25.649
and they always brought some bags or boxes.

00:14:25.649 --> 00:14:29.379
And for the non-witnesses,

00:14:29.379 --> 00:14:31.379
it was like a miracle.

00:14:31.379 --> 00:14:33.379
And they kept asking,

00:14:33.379 --> 00:14:34.379
do you know them?

00:14:34.379 --> 00:14:36.379
Are these your relatives?

00:14:36.379 --> 00:14:37.379
No.

00:14:37.379 --> 00:14:39.379
We have never seen them before.

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:41.379
Why are they helping you?

00:14:41.379 --> 00:14:43.379
Oh, it was such a good witness.

00:14:43.379 --> 00:14:46.659
On March 24th,

00:14:46.659 --> 00:14:50.659
exactly a month after the war began.

00:14:50.659 --> 00:14:53.659
Danielle and I gave birth to a beautiful baby girl.

00:14:53.659 --> 00:14:57.100
It was a great help

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:00.100
that a sister who could translate

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:03.100
was present in the delivery room.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.100
This made me feel calmer.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:12.360
We try to speak at every possible opportunity,

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.360
sending each other text messages

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:18.360
and communicating via video conferencing.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.360
I send Danielle videos and photos

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.360
of our little girl, Mido Slava,

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:29.889
and we constantly reassure each other of our love,

00:15:29.889 --> 00:15:32.889
and that we appreciate each other very much.

00:15:32.889 --> 00:15:39.730
Feeling forced to move to another country

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:41.730
is very difficult.

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:45.230
But thanks to Jehovah,

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:47.230
I have become convinced

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:49.230
that his organization

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:52.230
really functions as one body.

00:15:52.230 --> 00:16:00.100
And I'm very happy to be part of it.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.100
The Brotherhood.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:07.100
These are the people waiting for you with open arms.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:13.299
We felt that it was Jehovah

00:16:13.299 --> 00:16:17.649
who personally helped us.

00:16:17.649 --> 00:16:19.649
It is really evident that a lot of refugees

00:16:19.649 --> 00:16:21.649
from Ukraine who come here

00:16:21.649 --> 00:16:23.649
are alone with their problems.

00:16:23.649 --> 00:16:28.629
And it is very difficult for them.

00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:30.629
How much easier it is for us

00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:33.629
because we have a friendly Brotherhood with us.

00:16:33.629 --> 00:16:35.629
And although we're in a foreign country,

00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:37.629
we feel at home.

00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:40.629
All things go to Jehovah.
