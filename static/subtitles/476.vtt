00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.710
So our text for today is Philippians chapter 3 and verse 14.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:12.710
And here the Apostle Paul assures the Philippian congregation that he has not lost sight of the goal,

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.710
in spite of all the distressing things that he's dealing with.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:22.710
He's keeping his mind on the big picture, the advancement of the good news, the hope that he has for the future.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.710
Well, how can this help us?

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.710
Well, let's consider three things that Paul was dealing with during this time he was writing his letter to the Philippians

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.710
that could have diverted his focus and see what we can learn.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.710
The first thing we'll consider is discouragement.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.710
Well, why? Well, Paul, as we know, was under house arrest at the time.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.710
He could not do what he wanted to do for Jehovah.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.710
It's thought that when Paul wrote his letter to the Philippians,

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.710
he had been under house arrest for a year or more.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.710
How discouraging this could have been for Paul.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:07.709
Also, we remember during this time the Philippian congregation had sent a Paphroditus to Paul with a gift from the congregation.

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:11.709
Well, what happened? A Paphroditus was to go and encourage Paul,

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:16.709
but he ended up getting sick to the point of death and then got depressed.

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:24.709
So now rather than receiving help, Paul had to worry about and help a Paphroditus to recover and then deal with his depression,

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:29.709
then eventually send him back home, all while dealing with his own situation.

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:36.709
And finally, who knows the emotional ups and downs that Paul dealt with during his imprisonment?

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:41.709
We can imagine him getting reports of, I think your case is going to get heard soon.

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:45.709
You can leave soon and then, no, sorry, nothing's happening.

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:48.709
You're going to be here for a while.

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:51.709
Well, can you relate to Paul?

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:59.709
Many of our brothers and sisters are getting emotionally and physically distressed or fatigued due to this pandemic.

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:02.709
Some of them feel like they are in house arrest.

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:04.709
There seems to be no end in sight.

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:08.710
Sometimes it's like we take one step forward and two steps back.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.710
We cannot do the things that we want to do for Jehovah.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.710
What do we learn from Paul?

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.710
What did he do?

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.710
Let's look at Philippians chapter 1 and verse 12.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:20.710
Where was his focus?

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.710
Philippians 1 and 12, he says,

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:29.710
Now I want you to know, brothers, that my situation has actually turned out for the advancement of the good news.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.710
He focused on advancing the good news, the big picture.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.710
He talks about how his situation was giving a witness to the prison guards.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.710
How his endurance in verse 14 was encouraging the congregation.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.710
He was not in the situation.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.710
He wanted to be in, but he focused on the positive.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.710
And see, we need to do the same.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.710
Keep our focus on the big picture.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.710
The increases that we hear about, the incredible experiences that we're hearing that shows

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:05.710
that Jehovah's people are continuing to advance kingdom interest even during these difficult times.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:11.710
Now we have heard so many encouraging reports that remind us that Jehovah has been with his people

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:17.710
and with his organization during this last period of time, during this pandemic.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:23.710
So that his organization not only continued functioning, but flourishing.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.710
Should we lose trust now that Jehovah will not carry us the rest of the way?

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.710
A good reminder from Paul.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.710
What else was Paul dealing with?

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:40.710
Well, our second point is that he was dealing with pain of heart due to those who had left the truth.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.710
Look at chapter 3 and verse 18.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.710
Philippians 3, 18, he says,

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:53.710
He says, for there are many, I used to mention them often, but now I mention them also with weeping

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.710
who are walking as enemies of the torture stake of the Christ.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.710
Yes, some who used to be close to Paul had abandoned the truth.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.710
This distressed him.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.710
It made him weep.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.710
Well, can we relate?

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:08.710
Well, yes.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:14.710
Some among us have very close family members or friends who have left the truth and are now disfellowshipped.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.709
And that's painful.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.709
Now, when emotions are running high, it can cause us to question decisions made by the elders,

00:04:22.709 --> 00:04:27.709
or maybe to struggle with the direction on how to deal with disfellowshipped ones.

00:04:27.709 --> 00:04:29.709
It tests our faith.

00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:36.709
You see, when somebody is heading into a wayward way, of course, we all do what we can to help.

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:39.709
The friends, family, the elders, everybody,

00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:43.709
but when someone has reached the point where they have to be disfellowshipped,

00:04:43.709 --> 00:04:49.709
Jehovah now, in effect, says, I have this now, leave this to me.

00:04:49.709 --> 00:04:51.709
And what do we have to do?

00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:57.709
We have to back off and trust Jehovah in his organization.

00:04:57.709 --> 00:04:59.709
Now, we can illustrate this way.

00:04:59.709 --> 00:05:04.709
You could picture maybe you're having a nice family meal with your family and during the evening,

00:05:04.709 --> 00:05:09.709
suddenly your uncle grabs his chest and falls over on the floor unconscious.

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:10.709
Well, what happens?

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:12.709
Well, we all jump into action.

00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:14.709
Somebody starts doing CPR.

00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:15.709
Somebody calls the paramedics.

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:17.709
The rest of us try to do it.

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:18.709
We can.

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:21.709
But what do we do when the paramedics arrive?

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:28.709
We step out of the way and we leave our loved one in the hands of those who have been trained to handle medical emergencies.

00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:35.709
Now, would we ever think of pulling the paramedics off of our uncle and insisting that, no, we're going to care for him ourselves?

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:36.709
No.

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:41.709
We know by doing that, we will greatly reduce the chances of him surviving.

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:46.709
See, we leave it to the paramedics and we hope for the best.

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:50.709
Now, sometimes the patient recovers.

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:54.709
Sadly, sometimes the patient does not recover.

00:05:54.709 --> 00:06:01.709
But yet, we know that he has a much better chance of recovering at the hands of the trained paramedics.

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:05.709
And see the same is true with our loved ones who leave Jehovah.

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:12.709
At first, we try to do what we can, but then we step back and leave it to the paramedics, if you will.

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:18.709
The spiritually qualified men who are trained to offer necessary spiritual assistance.

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:20.709
That's Jehovah's arrangement.

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:22.709
But it doesn't mean that it's easy.

00:06:22.709 --> 00:06:23.709
It's painful.

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:24.709
It hurts.

00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:28.709
It's similar watching those events unfold with your uncle there.

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:29.709
It's emotional.

00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:30.709
It hurts.

00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:32.709
Well, what do we do to get through it?

00:06:32.709 --> 00:06:34.709
Well, the same thing Paul did.

00:06:34.709 --> 00:06:35.709
Look back.

00:06:35.709 --> 00:06:41.709
You notice there in verse chapter 3, verse 18, it says that this just stressed him so much that he wept.

00:06:41.709 --> 00:06:43.709
But where was his focus?

00:06:43.709 --> 00:06:45.709
Look at verse 20.

00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:48.709
But our citizenship exists in the heavens.

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:53.709
And we are eagerly waiting for a savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:06:53.709 --> 00:06:58.709
Yes, he stayed focused on his hope for the future.

00:06:58.709 --> 00:07:05.709
The third thing we'll discuss at Paul was dealing with was concerns about potential divisions in the congregation.

00:07:05.709 --> 00:07:10.709
Notice what he says as recorded in Philippians chapter 2 and verse 2.

00:07:10.709 --> 00:07:20.709
He says, make my joy full by being of the same mind and having the same love, being completely united, having the one thought in mind.

00:07:20.709 --> 00:07:21.709
Unity.

00:07:21.709 --> 00:07:26.709
See, Paul was concerned with divisions cropping up in the congregation.

00:07:26.709 --> 00:07:29.709
Unity was the theme of his letter to the Ephesians.

00:07:29.709 --> 00:07:37.709
It was also featured in his letter to the Colossians, all of which were written around the same time as the Philippian letter, the letter to the Philippian congregation.

00:07:37.709 --> 00:07:41.709
Why was Paul so concerned about unity?

00:07:41.709 --> 00:07:49.709
Well, because highly charged issues were circulating at the time, at one of which that wouldn't go away was the issue of circumcision.

00:07:49.709 --> 00:07:54.709
Some were insisting that everybody must get circumcised.

00:07:54.709 --> 00:07:57.709
Others were saying, no, it's a personal choice whether you do or not.

00:07:57.709 --> 00:08:03.709
False teachers were using this issue to discredit Paul's position as an apostle.

00:08:03.709 --> 00:08:09.709
Now, the governing body had made their position on this subject very clear.

00:08:09.709 --> 00:08:12.709
Well, what did Paul do?

00:08:12.709 --> 00:08:18.709
Well, he trusted Jehovah and Jehovah's representatives and he supported the decision.

00:08:18.709 --> 00:08:22.709
Well, do we see similar situations today?

00:08:22.709 --> 00:08:30.709
Yes, there are many highly charged issues that exist that have the potential of creating divisions in the congregation.

00:08:30.709 --> 00:08:33.710
We must never let that happen.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:35.710
It's a test of our faith.

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:37.710
Well, what did Paul do?

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.710
We'll notice a few verses down in verse 5.

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:46.710
He says, keep this mental attitude in you that was also in Christ Jesus.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:50.710
He focused on the Christ, on the big picture.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:52.710
And see, we need to do the same.

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:54.710
Focus on Jesus.

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:59.710
Trust that Christ is leading this organization.

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:04.710
Trust those whom Jehovah and Jesus trust to take the lead.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.710
Keep our focus on the goal and the big picture.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.710
And we think about it. We appreciate so much.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:14.710
All that Jehovah and his organization have done for us.

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:31.710
And isn't it true? We see clearly how the direction that we've received over the years indicates that Jehovah is clearly with his people, with his organization, with the governing body, those who are taking the lead, and that Christ is firmly in control.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:36.710
Why would we question the direction we're getting now?

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:44.710
Yes, our scripture text provides very good lessons to help us navigate troubling and distressing times.

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:48.710
Philippians 3.14, I'm pressing on to the goal for the prize.

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:55.710
And we need to have the same attitude whether our prize is everlasting life in the heavens or here on earth.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:10:01.710
And like when Paul wrote the Philippians, there are many things that can divert our focus today.

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:12.710
And focusing on these troublesome situations can cause us to become anxious, bitter, depressed, angry, or distracted.

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:18.710
So may we follow Paul's example and keep our eyes fixed firmly on the big picture.

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:20.710
The goal that's set before us.

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:28.710
May we stay focused on the incredible privilege we have to be part of this organization and what Jehovah is doing in these last days.

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:36.710
The undeniable evidence that Jehovah's blessing is people, blessing those who are taking the lead that Christ is firmly in control.

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:42.710
Stay focused on the unfolding of Bible prophecy, our beautiful hope that we have for the future.

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:52.710
And if we do, like Paul, one day we will not need to press on any longer to the goal because we will be living it.
