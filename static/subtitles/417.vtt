00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:07.179
Estimates vary, but some say that the basic chemical elements that make up the human

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:12.140
body can be valued at as little as five dollars.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.420
And that's understandable when we read the description of man's creation at Genesis

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.660
chapter 2, verse 7.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.820
Please open your Bibles to this scripture, and as we read it, notice the materials Jehovah

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.460
used when he created man.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.539
Genesis 2 7 says, and Jehovah God went on to form the man out of dust from the ground

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:43.820
and to blow into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living person.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.299
Jehovah took basic elements from the ground and formed them into a complex structure.

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:56.020
Then he added the breath of life and raised the value of that dust to a level that can

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.780
be described only as priceless.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.379
From five dollars worth of dust, God created a walking, talking, intelligent human made

00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:08.980
in God's own image.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.819
Since man is made from the dust of the ground, it's fitting that the prophet Jeremiah and

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:21.540
Isaiah use the example of a potter molding clay to illustrate our relationship with our

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.739
creator.

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:28.900
There's so much we can say about this illustration, but I'd like to focus on three lessons that

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.780
we can learn from the potter and the clay.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.819
The first is, be content.

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:39.219
Be content with how Jehovah molds and uses us.

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:42.859
Second, be patient and endure.

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:47.340
And third, cultivate an obedient heart.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.700
Let's consider the first lesson.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.180
Be content with how Jehovah molds and uses us.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.260
Pottery making is a highly treasured art form in Japan.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:06.219
And depending where the clay came from and the methods used, the results can be very unique.

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:12.780
Pottery made in the town of Bezen in Western Japan is called Bezenyaki or Bezenware.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.580
And it is noted for its earth tones and the fact that it is not glazed.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:26.139
This Koyaki made in the town of Moshko north of Tokyo is colorful and it is glazed.

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:32.379
Each piece of pottery from these different regions has unique characteristics, but no

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:40.219
matter what the color, consistency or origin of the clay, the final result is still a

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:42.219
piece of pottery.

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:45.419
We can say the same thing about Jehovah's people.

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:48.419
Each one of us is custom made.

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:52.379
It's true we come from 240 lands around the world.

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:58.419
Our physical features, our customs, our language, our personalities vary greatly.

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:01.580
But we all have one thing in common.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.500
We are all molded by the same potter.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:13.259
As Jehovah uses his word, his Holy Spirit and his organization to mold us into a desirable

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:18.379
vessel, we may notice a lump of clay on the potter's wheel next to us.

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.139
He's taken a different shape.

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:24.020
He's become in a useful jar.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.460
She's starting to look like a beautiful vase.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.729
I'm just a plain old bowl.

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:36.449
Well there's no reason for us to be envious or to become competitive.

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:43.050
Rather we should be happy that Jehovah has such a variety of loyal worshipers all using

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.810
their God-given gifts to bring him praise.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.530
Please open your Bibles to 1 Corinthians 12.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.930
We'll read verses 14, 17, and 18.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.810
And here we find the illustration of the human body being used to show the great variety

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.090
of gifts that we have in the Christian congregation.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.250
So there's no reason for us to be competitive.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:16.930
1 Corinthians 12 verses 14, 17, and 18 reads, for indeed the body is made up not of one

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.170
member but of many.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:25.290
And verse 17, if the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be?

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.889
If it were all hearing, where would the sense of smell be?

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:36.730
But now God has arranged each of the body members just as He pleased.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.170
Remember, Jehovah is the potter.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.410
We are the clay.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:48.649
And He will use each one of us in a way that utilizes our strong points to help us to

00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:51.490
do His will.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:58.730
For the second lesson, please open your Bibles to James 1 and we'll read verse 4.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:04.610
This scripture talks about the need for us to be patient or to endure.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:11.970
James 1 4 says, but let endurance complete its work so that you may be complete and sound

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:17.209
in all respects, not lacking in anything.

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:21.050
So why do we need endurance in order to be molded?

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.649
While pottery making is a time-consuming process.

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:30.009
And that's why the potter uses the wheel to keep the clay spinning around and around repeatedly

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:32.569
going over the same places.

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:36.250
And gradually he gives the clay its shape.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.810
In addition, even before putting the clay on the wheel, the potter washes it to remove

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.410
any debris such as pebbles and sticks.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:50.490
Then he may trample on it with his feet to make it pasty and malleable.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.930
Next he needs it with his hands like kneading bread dough.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.529
And finally, he places it on the potter's wheel.

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:05.889
In the same way, before Jehovah can start to mold us, major preparations are needed.

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:10.730
When we start to learn the truth, we have a lot of debris mixed in with the clay.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:17.009
The debris may be personality traits, some form of wrong conduct, or false religious

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:20.050
beliefs and practices.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:25.009
Once we correct these matters, we dedicate our lives to Jehovah and he puts us on the

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:29.290
wheel to continue the molding process.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:33.449
At that point, we all are terribly out of shape.

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:39.129
But Jehovah patiently molds us into a desirable vessel.

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:42.370
Some of us have been in the molding process for decades.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.930
Others just started in recent years.

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:50.970
But no matter how long we've been spinning on the great potter's wheel, we must endure

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:54.970
and remain soft and pliable.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:00.449
Cultivating an obedient heart will help us to do this.

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:03.250
And that is our third lesson.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:08.290
When Solomon became king of Israel, he made one request of Jehovah.

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:12.290
This recorded at 1 Kings chapter 3, verse 9, where he prayed,

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:19.889
So grant your servant an obedient heart to judge your people to discern between good

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:22.410
and bad.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:29.410
Having an obedient heart means allowing Jehovah's Word to mold our desires, our affections,

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:33.850
our emotions, our feelings, our motives, our goals in life.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:37.009
Interestingly, much pottery is hollow.

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:41.970
And that means the potter has to put his hands and fingers inside the clay to give it

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.209
its proper form.

00:07:44.209 --> 00:07:52.290
In the same way, God's Word has to get into our hearts to build us up from within.

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:56.930
Please open your Bibles to Psalm 143, verse 10.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:04.810
These words of David reveal a humble, teachable spirit that will help us to cultivate an obedient

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:06.129
heart.

00:08:06.129 --> 00:08:11.490
Psalm 143, verse 10 says, Teach me to do your will.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.370
For you are my God.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:14.610
Your spirit is good.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:17.209
May it lead me on level ground.

00:08:17.209 --> 00:08:23.250
Yes, there is much we can learn from the illustration of the potter and the clay.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:28.529
First of all, it teaches us contentment with the wage of Jehovah is molding us and our

00:08:28.529 --> 00:08:30.449
fellow workers.

00:08:30.449 --> 00:08:36.090
It also shows us the need for endurance and the need to cultivate an obedient heart.

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:44.250
So may we continue to submit to the gentle, loving hands of our great potter.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:49.730
If we do that, sometime in the future he's going to stop spinning that wheel.

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:54.250
He's going to look down at what used to be five dollars worth of clay and say with

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:57.850
a smile, perfect.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:04.649
Well hearing that, how happy we will be that like Isaiah, we said, O Jehovah, we are the

00:09:04.649 --> 00:09:07.929
clay and you are our potter.
