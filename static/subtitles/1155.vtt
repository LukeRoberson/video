00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:07.370
Are you convinced that Jehovah wants you to rejoice?

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.970
We have many reasons to believe that.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.890
Creation is one such proof.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.530
In the beginning, the Bible teaches that Jehovah worked very hard to make our home a delightful

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.969
place to live here on planet Earth.

00:00:22.969 --> 00:00:28.530
This included his creating millions of different species of plants and animals.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:34.990
And when he finished with all this amazing activity, do you know what our Creator did next?

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:42.049
At the end of the sixth creative day, the Bible tells us at Genesis 1 and verse 31, God

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:48.829
saw everything He had made, and look, it was very good.

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.670
Think about that.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.109
After working hard over perhaps the course of thousands of years, our Father paused.

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:04.790
He inspected everything, and then He rejoiced in all that He had made.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.670
Brothers and sisters, the beauty and wisdom in creation proves that our Heavenly Father

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.310
wants us to enjoy life on planet Earth.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.909
In fact, He wants us to join Him in rejoicing over all that He has made.

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.430
But how can we do that?

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.030
The Bible gives us a clue at Psalm 111 and verse 2.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.469
I invite you, please, to open your Bible and read along with all of us Psalm 111, verse

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:36.950
2.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.709
It says, The works of Jehovah are great.

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:46.989
They are studied by all those finding pleasure in them.

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:52.030
We see clearly in the Bible that Jehovah invites us to look closely at the things He has

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:59.150
made so that we can learn from them, and doing so is a delightful experience.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.829
So let's do that together.

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:09.310
In this symposium, we will examine six of Jehovah's many works and our God-given ability

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.870
to enjoy them all.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.030
First we'll focus our attention on exquisite flowers.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.789
Then our next speaker will talk about one of our favorite things, delicious food.

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:28.550
Next we will discuss beautiful colors, our well-designed bodies, delightful sounds, and

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.189
lastly fascinating animals.

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:37.189
Each talk in this series will also teach us scriptural lessons from creation that can

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:42.949
help us rejoice in life even now in these difficult last days.

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:45.509
Well are you as ready as I am?

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:49.750
Let's start by looking closely at exquisite flowers.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.469
In the following video, I invite you to look for the answers to these three questions.

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:59.430
First, how many species of flowering plants are there?

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.750
Second, what practical needs do flowers serve?

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.389
And third, how can flowers help us when we get anxious?

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:15.060
Please enjoy the video.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:27.360
The earth has more than 350,000 species of flowering plants.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.069
Flowers serve practical needs.

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:40.430
Flowers make pollen in order to reproduce and nectar for creatures that spread pollen.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:47.759
Pollination produces nutritious seeds, fruits and vegetables.

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:52.840
The beautiful flower we see may look like this to be.

00:03:52.879 --> 00:04:01.860
Some flowers reflect ultraviolet light in ways that create a hard to mistarget.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.379
We enjoy more than the flowers beauty and aroma.

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:12.219
Yet some plants do not need beautiful flowers to reproduce.

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:20.019
Flowers, pollen, nectar and aromas are costly for plants to produce.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.139
Those resources could be used for other purposes.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.819
Plans make flowers in breathtaking abundance.

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:47.800
The hover generously created flowers in a way that brings us joy

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:54.139
and reminds us to trust him when we are anxious.

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:57.579
Take a lesson from the lilies of the field.

00:04:57.579 --> 00:05:02.459
How they grow, they do not toil nor do they spin.

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:14.649
But not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these.

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:22.089
Did that video stir within you a desire to get to know Jehovah's creative works even better?

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:29.329
Jehovah designed us to enjoy the beauty of flowers and their lovely fragrances.

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:35.810
Can you imagine trying to study all 350,000 species of flowering plants?

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:43.649
Admiring their beauty, smelling them and maybe even making a drawing or taking a photo of each one?

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:51.089
You know, if you started today and spent a little time every day getting to know a different flower,

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:56.610
your study project would take a little over 958 years.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.490
It's a good thing we're going to live forever, isn't it?

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.569
But in addition to seeing the beauty and flowers,

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:10.009
as we've learned in the video, flowers play an important role in our ecosystem.

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:17.689
Flowers make pollen in order to reproduce and nectar for creatures like the bees that spread pollen.

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:23.089
In turn, pollination produces nutritious seeds, fruits and vegetables.

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:35.529
Thanks to the flowers, we have food to eat and how we marvel at the ingenious design that's evident in all things in creation.

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:41.410
Many people today enjoy looking at creation, but few realize that when they do so,

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:48.490
they're actually getting a glimpse into the mind and heart of our loving creator, Jehovah.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.970
Well, that's not true of us, though, is it?

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.490
Because we know who Jehovah is.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:58.569
When we carefully observe all the things he has made, we naturally think of him,

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:03.449
our drawn closer to him and to his beautiful qualities.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:14.730
At one point in life, the faithful man Job was reminded by his friend Elihu to stop and consider carefully the wonderful works of God.

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.730
Do you recall how that advice helped Job?

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:27.329
As Job learned, our joy increases when we're focused on Jehovah and on his works instead of on ourselves.

00:07:27.329 --> 00:07:31.730
Parents and young ones, this is a good lesson for all of us,

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:37.129
following the advice given to Job can also draw us closer to Jehovah.

00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:44.009
How much better that is than spending time with much of the world's entertainment that is debased?

00:07:44.009 --> 00:07:50.889
Such pre-packaged entertainment is often designed to turn us away from Jehovah, not draw us closer to him.

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:55.449
But what about spending time observing Jehovah's works?

00:07:55.449 --> 00:08:01.050
Now, that's a wholesome pastime with a future.

00:08:01.089 --> 00:08:07.810
Observing flowers may also bring to our mind another lesson, one that Jesus taught.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:14.689
Please open your Bible again to Matthew 6 and we'll read together verses 28 to 30.

00:08:14.689 --> 00:08:18.490
In the reading, look for the answer to the following question.

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:22.730
How can flowers help us when we get anxious?

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:26.810
Let's read Matthew 6 verses 28 to 30.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:28.649
Jesus said,

00:08:28.689 --> 00:08:32.610
Also, why are you anxious about clothing?

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:36.570
Take a lesson from the lilies of the field how they grow.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:39.610
They do not toil, nor do they spend.

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:45.730
But I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:52.169
Now, if this is how God closed the vegetation of the field that is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven,

00:08:52.169 --> 00:08:57.649
will he not much rather clothe you with little faith?

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.570
How heartwarming.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:03.450
Have you ever been anxious about food and clothing?

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.529
If so, you're not alone.

00:09:05.529 --> 00:09:12.570
Among those listening to Jesus on this occasion were many poor people who had the same natural concerns.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.450
But Jesus encouraged them.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:15.809
How so?

00:09:15.809 --> 00:09:20.409
By reminding them to take a lesson from the flowers.

00:09:20.409 --> 00:09:22.570
Jesus knew what we know.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:31.809
Jehovah generously created flowers in a way that brings us joy and reminds us to trust him when we are anxious.

00:09:31.809 --> 00:09:41.409
When we see how well Jehovah takes care of all the flowers, we're reminded of how generous he is and his loving care of humans.

00:09:41.409 --> 00:09:50.049
And like Jehovah, when we give generously to others and help care for their needs when it's within the power of our hand to do so,

00:09:50.049 --> 00:09:54.889
we too will experience the joy that comes from giving.

00:09:54.889 --> 00:10:04.929
Dear ones, may we never forget that it was Jehovah who gave us the ability to appreciate exquisite flowers.

00:10:04.929 --> 00:10:13.929
May doing just that bring you joy and add to your praise of Jehovah forever.

00:10:13.929 --> 00:10:21.690
Now, Brother Ralph Walls, who serves as a helper to the Personnel Committee, will present the next talk of this symposium.

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:26.730
Creation proves that Jehovah wants us to rejoice, delicious food.
