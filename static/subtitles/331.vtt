00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:08.929
Today's text leaves no doubt that Jehovah holds elderly ones in high regard.

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:14.089
After all, the text says, before gray hair, you should rise up and you must show honor

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:16.329
to an older man.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:20.410
And Jehovah truly loves those who have grown old in his service.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:27.570
Oh, they may suffer the pains and limitations of advancing age, some more so than others,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.329
but we appreciate their faithful service as they continue to radiate the joy of Jehovah.

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:41.729
Likely you remember the article in the June 1st, 2015, Watchtower How to Age Gracefully.

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:47.289
The opening paragraph asks, how do you feel when the thought of aging comes up?

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:51.729
It fills many with concern, anxiety, and even dread.

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:57.289
This is because aging is usually associated with negatives, such as diminished looks,

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:02.929
a frail body, memory loss, and chronic diseases.

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:08.969
Regarding all that two years ago, the Watchtower stated, we need not try too hard to erase

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:11.409
all signs of aging.

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.890
Those signs can be evidence of maturity, dignity, and inner beauty.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.090
And as was already said this morning, Proverbs 1631 says, grayheadedness is a crown of beauty

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.450
when it is found in the way of righteousness.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.650
And that is certainly how Jehovah views us.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.290
The Watchtower said, and we should try to view ourselves as he does.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.090
Some years before that, another article stated, if advancing age hinders you from accomplishing

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.689
as much as you would like in Christian activity, do not despair.

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:50.930
Remember, the value of a Christian is gauged not by his level of activity, but by his faith

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:58.450
and depth of love, and by serving Jehovah to the best of one's own ability.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:06.530
And yet the hard fact of life is that right now we are all experiencing the aging process.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.129
The older we get, the more we become aware of that.

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.689
All of us, whether young or old, should give thought to what Moses prayed about in Psalm

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:15.689
90.

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:21.849
So let's turn there to Psalm 90 and keep our Bibles open for a few verses.

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:27.189
We start with some phrases in verse 9.

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:34.750
He prayed, our days ebb away, our years come to an end like a whisper.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:41.830
Verse 10, the span of our life is 70 years, or 80 if one is especially strong.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:49.509
While they are filled with trouble and sorrow, they quickly pass by and away we fly.

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:52.590
My dear father died faithful at the age of 91.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.150
A few years before that, his doctor told him he had a lot of things wrong with him and

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.270
none of them could be fixed.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.310
So my father would often say old age is not for sissies.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:13.509
Well, the effects of aging can certainly make life more difficult, less enjoyable, and even frightening.

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:17.710
How meaningful then are Moses' next words in verse 12.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:24.710
Teach us how to count our days so that we may acquire a heart of wisdom.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.310
What does it mean to count our days?

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.789
Well, it surely means more than just checking them off on a jail cell wall.

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:38.590
Nor does it mean that we should become obsessed with how long we might live.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:46.830
Now, like Moses, we need to pray that Jehovah will teach us to value our days as a very precious resource

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.430
that we use our days in a worthwhile way that brings honor to Jehovah.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:59.110
So regardless of our age, if we live each day so as to have Jehovah's approval and make his heart glad,

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.229
then we can continue to pray as Moses did in verse 14.

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:10.150
Satisfy us with your loyal love in the morning so that we may share joyfully, shout joyfully,

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.710
and rejoice during all our days.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.189
Solomon also expressed wisdom about this matter.

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:23.990
If you turn to Ecclesiastes, the 12th chapter, the first verse is very familiar to us,

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.230
the second, not so much. Ecclesiastes 12, 1.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.069
Remember, then, your grand creator of the days in the days of your youth

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:37.029
before the days of distress come and the years arrive when you will say,

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:43.629
I have no pleasure in them, before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars grow dark

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:47.509
and the clouds return after the downpour.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:54.790
In verse 2, Solomon likens the days of youth to the Palestinian summer

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:01.750
when sun, moon, and stars shine from a cloudless sky and things look very bright.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:08.430
And there's no better time to think seriously about the creator than when a person is in the summertime of his life

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.350
in his prime when he can really give his very best in Jehovah's service.

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:18.629
However, that ability wanes during the days of distress, of old age,

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:24.790
when the body is weak and alien, and then a person's days are like the cold rainy season of winter

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.829
with one downpour of trouble after another.

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:34.230
Some say they wish they could live their life backward, but what would that be like?

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.870
Well, one person explained it this way, get old age out of the way at the start,

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:44.790
spending the first few years in an old age home and being evicted when you're too young and well,

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.790
then receive a gold watch and begin your years of secular work,

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.670
work 40 years until you're young enough to enjoy retirement,

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:57.949
then go to school, slowly turn into a playful child with no responsibilities,

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:03.750
eventually turn into a little baby and finishing off as a gleam in someone's eye.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.910
What a preposterous notion.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.589
Or is it?

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:09.790
Not totally.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.629
Look at Job 33, verse 25.

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:18.949
Job 33, 25.

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:25.629
The Bible promises that in the new world, the aging process will in effect reverse.

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:31.230
For it says, let his flesh become fresher or healthier than in youth,

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:36.310
let him return to the days of his youthful vigor.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:41.110
And for those who are never going to die, they will return to the days of their youth,

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:46.550
though not all the way back to the crib, but back to the prime of adulthood,

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:53.310
when we will have a strong, perfectly healthy body to complement a sound mindful of knowledge,

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:59.949
wisdom, and experience, and who would want, not want to enjoy that.

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:07.389
Well, none of us are so old now that we cannot hope to live to see that day come soon.

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:13.709
The article How to Age Gracefully states whether confronted with age-related problems or not,

00:07:13.709 --> 00:07:17.149
most people wish to be able to age gracefully.

00:07:17.149 --> 00:07:18.949
How can this be done?

00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:28.310
In part, doing so depends on our attitude and our willingness and ability to adapt to this new phase of life.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:33.589
And one simple and practical principle of the article highlights is to be positive.

00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:38.230
It says, as you age, you may experience negative feelings when you remember your youthful vigor,

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:40.189
and the many things you were once able to do.

00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:42.230
This is understandable.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.389
However, make an effort not to be overcome by those negative feelings.

00:07:46.389 --> 00:07:53.910
Dwelling on the past can make your days gloomy and discourage you from doing what you are still able to do.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:58.470
So with the right attitude, it is possible to age gracefully.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:01.350
Right now, we cannot live our life backward.

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:10.949
We can live it forward, eventually on into the endless future when we will turn out to be a real gleam in someone's eye, Jehovah's.

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:11.870
Why?

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:16.470
Because he will know that we remembered him, our grand creator.
