00:00:48.340 --> 00:01:07.810
Discipline can be painful, appreciating it for what it truly is, takes faith.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:35.890
Moses!

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.120
Mary, oh it's so good to see you.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.420
I've missed you. It is time.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:02:52.120
I'll be exalted. Please. Don't give up on me.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.439
Miriam was well known in the camp of Israel.

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:07.360
She enjoyed a close relationship with her brothers, Moses and Aaron.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:31.629
During the slavery in Egypt and the Exodus that followed, the people had grown to respect and love her.

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.030
Zipura!

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.030
Oh welcome back.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.430
Aaron. Zipura.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.830
Perhaps at first Miriam was pleased to have Zipura back.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.830
How is Zipura settling in?

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:55.009
Well, everyone seems excited. Don't you think?

00:03:55.009 --> 00:04:12.919
But it seems that in time, she gave him to pride.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.919
She might have felt threatened.

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:16.920
Thank you, Zipura.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:26.480
Thinking that Zipura would replace her as the most prominent woman in the nation.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.589
In any case, Miriam and Aaron engaged in negative talk.

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:35.189
But she's a kushite.

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:38.459
And when she's his wife?

00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:45.670
Yes. But she's not one of us.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.870
Who knows how she influences him?

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.269
At first, their talk focused on Zipura.

00:04:52.269 --> 00:04:57.670
But it soon escalated into complaining about Moses himself.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.870
Book.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.670
The people need leadership.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.470
And they trust us.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.870
Miriam.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:14.180
Jehovah is leading the people.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:21.410
You're not listening.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.410
Miriam, where are we?

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.209
We are suffering out here.

00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:27.209
Some have questioned my brothers.

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:29.209
Something has to be done.

00:05:29.209 --> 00:05:31.209
She says his kushite life is destroyed.

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:33.209
I just don't understand who I am.

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:34.209
I'm tired of this.

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:35.209
We suffered in Egypt.

00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:36.209
And we're suffering here.

00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:37.209
Miriam is worried.

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:39.209
Maybe there's a better way.

00:05:39.209 --> 00:05:43.209
Moses is still qualified to lead the nation.

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:46.209
Maybe Jehovah wants us to do so.

00:05:46.209 --> 00:05:48.209
Maybe we have to listen to Moses.

00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:50.209
I'm sure other people feel the same.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.610
And we're suffering here.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.810
Why do we have to listen to Moses?

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:57.810
Let's jump back.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.810
Maybe Jehovah wants us to do so.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.810
Is it only by Moses that Jehovah has spoken?

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.810
Has he not also spoken to us?

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:15.139
The three of you.

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:32.680
To the tantam meeting.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.079
Hear my words.

00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:43.670
Please.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.670
It is not that way with my servant Moses.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.670
Face to face I speak to him.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.870
And the appearance of Jehovah is what he sees.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.269
Why then?

00:06:56.269 --> 00:07:00.470
Did you not fear to speak against my servant?

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:28.680
Against Moses?

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.680
I beg you, my Lord.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.079
Please do not hold us sin against us.

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:36.279
We have acted foolishly.

00:07:36.279 --> 00:07:43.689
Please do not let her continue like someone dead.

00:07:43.689 --> 00:08:03.769
Oh, God, please heal her, please.

00:08:03.769 --> 00:08:08.410
Let her be quarantined for seven days.

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:22.540
Afterward, she may be brought back.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:27.620
Jehovah, you are the most high.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:31.420
You chose Moses to lead your people and I.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.620
I disrespected him.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:54.139
And you, please, please forgive me.

00:08:54.139 --> 00:08:57.740
Miriam was not defined by her mistakes.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:08.620
Shall I go and call a nursing woman from the Hebrews?

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:13.139
To miss the child free.

00:09:13.139 --> 00:09:14.940
It is time.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:28.269
Jehovah will bless you and Aaron.

00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:32.669
Jehovah disciplines those he loves.

00:09:32.669 --> 00:09:46.919
Miriam accepted his discipline with faith.

00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:49.519
She was restored to God's favor

00:09:49.519 --> 00:10:10.120
and continued serving faithfully for decades.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:14.320
In centuries afterward, Jehovah lovingly honored Miriam

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.919
for her faithful service.

00:10:17.919 --> 00:10:22.320
Through his prophet Micah, he reminded his people.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.919
From the house of slavery I redeemed you.

00:10:25.919 --> 00:10:32.320
I sent before you, Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.
