00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:09.179
I arrived in a new city during the rainy season. It rained all day every day for a whole month.

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.179
At that time, there were only three publishers there.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.179
The first sister I met was my new pioneer partner.

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.179
At first, I felt as if the people in this territory spoke a different language.

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:25.179
When I tried to talk to some people about the Bible, they did not like it,

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:30.420
and some were even afraid of these new ideas.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.420
When government officials noticed that we had shared some tracks with the people,

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.420
they began to watch us and followed us for about three months.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.420
I felt overwhelmed by all of this and became very anxious.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.420
I had few return visits or opportunities to speak about Jehovah.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.420
I felt lost. I didn't know what to do or where to go.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.420
I often wondered, Father, why did you send me here?

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.420
It was like I had gone from being on a mountain peak to the bottom of a deep valley.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:10.260
I studied the Bible to see how Jehovah cared for his servants in the past.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.260
For example, I read how Jehovah told Jacob throughout his life,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
I will be with you wherever you go.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.260
I pictured Jehovah telling me the same thing.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.260
Don't worry, just go, and I will always be there to help you.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.260
I begged him to help me to be balanced, to feel peace,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
and to have courage to go out in the ministry.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.260
One day, Jehovah helped me to find a very good Bible student.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.260
It was an absolutely wonderful and unexpected gift from Jehovah.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
Our small group joins congregation meetings through the Internet.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.260
This arrangement is a valuable source of spiritual food for me.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.260
We get together for meals and association as well.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.260
The experiences on JW Broadcasting make me feel that I am not alone,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.260
and I always smile and wake by at the end.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
It's wonderful to be here.
