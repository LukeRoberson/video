00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:13.300
Jehovah God's inspired word makes this significant declaration at Titus, chapter 2, and verse 11.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.300
It reads,

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:25.300
For the undeserved kindness of God has been manifested, bringing salvation to all sorts of people.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.300
Yes, to all sorts of people.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.299
This was true in the first century, and it's true today, more than ever before.

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:43.299
We are a worldwide brotherhood made up of all sorts of people who have come to a knowledge of the truth,

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:48.299
and we have made the decision to serve Jehovah.

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:54.299
In this symposium, we will discuss three sorts of people.

00:00:54.299 --> 00:01:00.299
First, those whose mates are not yet Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:07.299
Second, those who are being raised by one believing parent or relative.

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.299
And third, those who are single.

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:23.299
Many brothers and sisters who find themselves in these situations are successfully putting up a hard fight for the faith as stated in Jude, verse 3.

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.299
And all of them are valuable assets to the congregation.

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:43.299
So as we discuss each situation during this symposium, please focus your attention on those who are in the congregation that you attend and ask yourself.

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:51.299
How can I show my appreciation for brothers and sisters who have these circumstances?

00:01:51.299 --> 00:02:05.640
And ask yourself, if I am in one of the situations being discussed, what will help me to continue to fight successfully for the faith?

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.639
This talk will focus on Christians with unbelieving mates.

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:20.639
For a well-known example, we look back to the first century to a woman named Eunice, the mother of Timothy.

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:31.639
She is referred to in Acts 161, which says that Timothy was the son of a believing Jewish woman, but of a Greek father.

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:35.639
So it refers to Eunice as a believing woman.

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:40.639
But it does not refer to Timothy's father as a believing man.

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:45.639
The point is that Timothy's father was not a Christian.

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:59.400
Nevertheless, Eunice, his mother, along with Lois, his grandmother, taught Timothy the holy writings, the truth as found in God's Word.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:08.400
When we speak of unbelieving mates, we recognize that their circumstances are not all the same.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.400
Some non-witness mates oppose true worship.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:20.400
Others are indifferent, and others may be tolerant, even somewhat interested and supportive.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.400
But they may not be progressing toward baptism.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:32.400
Some mates of believers are baptized, but they have weakened spiritually.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.400
They may no longer be regular at meetings, go in service, or participate in family worship.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:50.400
And last of all, sad to say, some mates are disfellowshipped, but we never give up on unbelieving mates.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:04:02.449
And we always hope that any who are disfellowshipped will come to their senses, repent, and return to Jehovah.

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:13.449
Is there something that we as publishers in the congregation can do to show appreciation for fellow believers whose mates are not yet serving Jehovah?

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:27.449
Yes, there is. And the Apostle Paul tells us at Philippians chapter 3, verse 17, that we can learn from their good example and imitate them.

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.449
Philippians chapter 3, verse 17 says,

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:46.449
Unitedly, become imitators of me, brothers, and keep your eye on those who are walking in a way that is in harmony with the example we set for you.

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:55.449
So Paul tells us to look closely at his example and the fine example of others in the congregation.

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:02.449
Among those setting a fine example are brothers and sisters who have unbelieving mates.

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:07.449
They have worked hard to maintain a strong relationship with Jehovah.

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:13.449
They have cultivated self-discipline to keep a good schedule of theocratic activities,

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:21.449
and many have become proficient in balancing family obligations with spiritual pursuits.

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:27.449
It's not easy, but they are doing it.

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:32.449
So how should we view them and treat them?

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:37.449
We do what Philippians chapter 2, verse 4 tells us to do.

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:44.449
We look out not only for our own interests, but also for the interests of others.

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:48.449
That means that we show concern for their well-being.

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:51.449
We treat them with respect.

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:54.449
We certainly do not ignore them.

00:05:54.449 --> 00:06:01.449
We recognize that as spiritual people, they have much to offer.

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:08.449
Isn't it wonderful that we are family and we belong to one another?

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:13.449
We take brothers and sisters who have unbelieving mates into account,

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:17.449
and we look out for their interests as the Scripture states,

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:22.449
because we love them and we see their good qualities.

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:27.449
So what can we do?

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:32.449
Whenever possible, we should include them in our activities.

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:36.449
But what else can we do?

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:42.449
We can show interest in their mates and try to help them spiritually.

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:51.449
For example, if circumstances allow, invite them with their mates for a meal or to a gathering.

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:59.449
You know that friendliness and upbuilding conversation can have a powerful effect on a person's heart.

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:08.449
As you watch the following video, think about how you can show appreciation for any in your congregation

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:14.449
whose mates are not presently serving Jehovah.

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:18.449
It was when my husband was really opposed.

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:25.449
One night, he put a knife to his stomach and said,

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:29.449
will you choose me or the truth?

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:32.449
My husband was cooperative.

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:36.449
He would wave goodbyes we went to the meetings.

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:41.449
But he wasn't interested at all.

00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:47.449
I felt really jealous when I saw families sitting together at assemblies.

00:07:47.449 --> 00:07:52.699
Because of work and taking care of his mother,

00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:56.699
my husband gradually started missing meetings.

00:07:56.699 --> 00:08:01.699
Some in our congregation, with good intentions, pointed it out to him.

00:08:01.699 --> 00:08:07.699
But the way they did this made him feel misunderstood and discouraged.

00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:11.699
And he put the Bible and the publications away.

00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:19.839
I also had times when I wanted to drift away with him.

00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:23.839
I was really happy when I learned the truth.

00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:27.839
In my zeal, I bombarded my husband with information.

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:30.839
And that made him worry that I had turned into a fanatic.

00:08:30.839 --> 00:08:36.090
I think he was genuinely concerned for his family.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:40.909
And thought that I had joined a weird religion.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:45.909
One family in the congregation often invited us to meals and outdoor activities.

00:08:45.909 --> 00:08:50.909
I think my husband appreciated those small acts of kindness.

00:08:50.909 --> 00:08:55.909
I also tried to show that I appreciated him through my speech and conduct.

00:08:55.909 --> 00:09:01.419
When my children and I applied what we learned in our lives,

00:09:01.419 --> 00:09:06.419
I think he gradually became interested in the truth.

00:09:06.419 --> 00:09:11.419
The words, safeguard your heart, caught my eye.

00:09:11.419 --> 00:09:19.419
I decided to try and keep my heart and my children's hearts towards Jehovah.

00:09:20.419 --> 00:09:23.419
When I went out in the ministry with my children,

00:09:23.419 --> 00:09:28.419
I would point out various aspects of God's creation around us.

00:09:28.419 --> 00:09:32.419
And before my husband would come home from work,

00:09:32.419 --> 00:09:36.419
I made it a habit to teach them God's word.

00:09:36.419 --> 00:09:42.419
I made a conscious effort to see myself in paradise with my husband.

00:09:42.419 --> 00:09:47.419
This strengthened my resolve to never leave the truth.

00:09:48.419 --> 00:09:53.419
I wrote caring notes to my husband when I went to the meetings.

00:09:53.419 --> 00:09:58.419
I was convinced that he would come back one day.

00:09:58.419 --> 00:10:01.419
And he did come back.

00:10:01.419 --> 00:10:08.419
I did not leave Jehovah and so Jehovah never abandoned me.

00:10:08.419 --> 00:10:12.419
My husband never embraced the truth.

00:10:12.419 --> 00:10:17.419
However, right now, all five of my children are in the truth.

00:10:17.419 --> 00:10:21.419
And I feel really blessed.

00:10:21.419 --> 00:10:26.419
Being able to serve Jehovah as a family, along with my husband,

00:10:26.419 --> 00:10:34.779
the joy and appreciation just keep dwelling up.

00:10:34.779 --> 00:10:37.779
What did we learn from the video?

00:10:37.779 --> 00:10:42.779
We learned that believing mates who display fine Christian qualities

00:10:42.779 --> 00:10:48.779
can have a positive influence on mates who are not yet serving Jehovah.

00:10:48.779 --> 00:10:54.779
So what will help you to keep on fighting for the faith?

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:59.779
Wisdom and strength that only Jehovah can provide.

00:10:59.779 --> 00:11:03.779
Remember, his power is unlimited,

00:11:03.779 --> 00:11:09.779
and he finds pleasure in showing favor to those who trust in him.

00:11:10.779 --> 00:11:13.779
Also, you know that he loves you,

00:11:13.779 --> 00:11:21.019
and that he listens to sincere prayers from those who want to do things his way.

00:11:21.019 --> 00:11:26.019
The combination of God's love, prayer, and his spirit

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:34.019
can give you the strength and the wisdom you need to maintain a balanced routine of spiritual activities

00:11:34.019 --> 00:11:40.019
while making sure to care for your family responsibilities.

00:11:40.019 --> 00:11:47.019
In the video, the believing mates took advantage of all the spiritual food that was available

00:11:47.019 --> 00:11:50.019
to build themselves up.

00:11:50.019 --> 00:11:56.019
And Jehovah helped them to display the spiritual qualities of patience and tact.

00:11:56.019 --> 00:12:03.019
You know, as well as I do, that at times we may not be as tactful as we should be.

00:12:03.019 --> 00:12:10.019
Being patient and tactful is not always easy, especially when you're tired

00:12:10.019 --> 00:12:15.019
and feel disappointed by your mates' words or actions.

00:12:15.019 --> 00:12:20.019
And yet, regardless of your situation,

00:12:20.019 --> 00:12:26.019
Jehovah can supply you with the power to keep setting a fine example

00:12:26.019 --> 00:12:33.399
as you keep on praying that your mate will eventually respond to the truth.

00:12:33.399 --> 00:12:38.399
At 1 Peter, chapter 3, verses 1 and 2,

00:12:38.399 --> 00:12:42.399
1 Peter 3, 1 and 2,

00:12:42.399 --> 00:12:47.399
we find this very wise and practical counsel.

00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:51.399
1 Peter 3, 1 and 2 reads,

00:12:51.399 --> 00:12:57.399
in the same way you wives be in subjection to your husbands

00:12:57.399 --> 00:13:01.399
so that if any are not obedient to the Word,

00:13:01.399 --> 00:13:07.399
they may be one without a word through the conduct of their wives.

00:13:07.399 --> 00:13:16.399
Because of having been eyewitnesses of your chased conduct together with deep respect.

00:13:16.399 --> 00:13:18.399
Isn't that wonderful?

00:13:18.399 --> 00:13:23.399
The counsel that Peter gives is tested and true.

00:13:23.399 --> 00:13:30.399
Its application has helped an untold number of unbelieving mates to accept the truth.

00:13:31.399 --> 00:13:36.399
And when you think about it, it truly is amazing how deep respect

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:45.399
and fine conduct can win over an unbelieving mate without a word being spoken.

00:13:45.399 --> 00:13:48.399
Of course, as you work what is good towards your mate,

00:13:48.399 --> 00:13:52.399
there undoubtedly will be opportunities to speak about the truth

00:13:52.399 --> 00:13:57.399
and provide spiritual assistance when circumstances permit

00:13:57.399 --> 00:14:00.399
and it seems appropriate.

00:14:00.399 --> 00:14:03.399
So keep on setting a fine example

00:14:03.399 --> 00:14:08.399
and praying that your mate will respond to the truth.

00:14:08.399 --> 00:14:17.399
Have faith in the inspired words that Paul wrote at 1 Corinthians, chapter 7 and verse 16.

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:20.399
1 Corinthians 7-16.

00:14:20.399 --> 00:14:27.399
And remember to continue to show a positive attitude toward your mate.

00:14:27.399 --> 00:14:34.399
1 Corinthians 7-16 poses two questions but with a positive slant.

00:14:34.399 --> 00:14:37.399
Chapter 7 and verse 16 read,

00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:43.399
For wife, how do you know whether you will save your husband?

00:14:43.399 --> 00:14:49.399
Or husband, how do you know whether you will save your wife?

00:14:49.399 --> 00:14:58.399
Yes, this text is telling us to remain positive about the possibility of a mate taking the truth.

00:14:58.399 --> 00:15:03.399
And it is a fact that many unbelieving mates have accepted the truth

00:15:04.399 --> 00:15:09.399
because of observing a husband or a wife who follows God's direction.

00:15:09.399 --> 00:15:14.399
Therefore, we continue to hope, wholeheartedly,

00:15:14.399 --> 00:15:19.399
that in time unbelieving mates will respond to the truth

00:15:19.399 --> 00:15:23.399
and find pleasure in serving Jehovah.

00:15:23.399 --> 00:15:28.399
As you apply divine counsel from God's Word,

00:15:28.399 --> 00:15:31.399
be assured that with Jehovah's help,

00:15:31.399 --> 00:15:36.399
you can continue to be a successful fighter for the faith

00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:41.779
and bring honor to Jehovah God.

00:15:41.779 --> 00:15:46.779
Brother Seth Hyatt, a helper to the service committee will consider the next talk.

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:53.779
Successful fighters for the faith, those being raised by single parents.
