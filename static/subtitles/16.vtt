00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:07.209
Welcome brothers and sisters. This month we are going to focus on the beautiful

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:13.009
Christian quality of endurance. As we watch these faith-strengthening

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:19.570
interviews and experiences, ask yourself, what is helping them to endure? And

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:26.010
how can I follow their example in my life? In each case, we will see the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.810
importance of always relying on Jehovah. When I prayed for comfort to calm

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:40.049
my heart, I felt a peace come over me. This convinced me that Jehovah was

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:45.289
truly looking after my family. And if you're made is going through a hard time

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:51.329
spiritually, how can you help? We will consider a practical scriptural

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:59.130
principle and how we can apply it. This is the April program of JW Broadcasting.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:23.489
We will start our program by visiting the South Africa branch. The work there

00:01:23.489 --> 00:01:28.329
has increased tremendously in the past few years and the branch is now

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:35.930
expanding to support the growth. Globally, the good news is published in over

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.489
800 languages. Almost 300 of those languages are spoken in Africa. The South

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:46.010
Africa branch supports printing, purchasing, building design and audio

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.170
video production in the region. Literature is printed and packed for over 15,000

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.769
congregations in 20 countries. To keep up with this demand, printing and shipping

00:01:56.769 --> 00:02:01.890
teams run two shifts per day. And in peak periods, the press works around the

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.689
clock. To help speed up work in the boundary and shipping departments, we have

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.650
automated and mechanized many work processes. Arrangements are underway to

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.490
install a second printing press but with all this increase storage spaces

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.289
become very limited. So the shipping department needs a larger warehouse. The

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:26.009
regional audio video center supports all languages in Africa with producing

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:30.849
audio and video items. They are currently busy with an extensive training

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:36.689
program. And soon, recording facilities will be set up in over 100 different

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:42.810
locations on this continent. The results are wonderful. Five years ago, none of

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:49.090
our videos were released in any of the languages of Africa. Now, 300 languages

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.449
have permission to produce audio and video publications. Recently, a branch

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:59.490
video team has been established to assist in providing video material for

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:05.250
JW.org and for JW Broadcasting. Due to this growing demand for audio and video

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.729
publications, new facilities are needed. In order to support these increases, the

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:14.449
branch is busy with a large expansion project. Doing so in an

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:18.889
ecologically sensitive residential area and without interrupting publication

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:24.129
production is challenging. The first part of the expansion project is a

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:29.169
five-story building with 48 new residence rooms. Now, this building is scheduled

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:34.650
to be completed by May of 2015. The major part of the expansion project is the

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.250
shipping warehouse. Now, this is a massive building. It's 210 meters long, 70

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.530
meters wide and 15 meters high. And perhaps just to put that into perspective, you

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.409
could park three Boeing 747s inside of this building.

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:52.129
Adjoining the warehouse is an administration building that will house the

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:57.330
regional audio video center. Included will be state-of-the-art recording studios

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.889
and editing facilities. When designing these buildings, attention was given to

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:06.729
making them environmentally friendly, energy efficient and also pleasant for the

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:10.490
brothers and sisters who will be working inside. The concrete structure of the

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.889
warehouse has been designed in such a way that in the future additional

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.970
suspended slabs for officers could be added if the use of the building ever

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.810
needs to change. This is what we call future-proofing a building. The branch

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.449
road system is also being upgraded to allow all of the literature to be

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:30.970
transported safely and efficiently between the countries and the new warehouse

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.529
building. Rainwater running from the roads, roofs and paving all of these new

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:40.009
buildings and areas is going to be directed into a large stormwater attenuation

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:44.250
pond and from there the water will slowly be discharged into a local stream.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.209
Solar roof panels are being installed in various places around the branch to

00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:52.170
harvest some of the beautiful sunshine that we have and added as electricity

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:56.970
into the Bethel power grid. The last phase of the project will be to upgrade the

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.410
printer in preparation for a second manned Roland printing press. A new

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.730
visitor's deck will be added and when you come on tour you'll be able to have

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.689
a bird's eye view of all of the action down at the process. The building

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:13.329
project has been contracted to several construction companies to speed up

00:05:13.329 --> 00:05:18.769
the schedule. At the peak of construction, 700 contract workers will be on

00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:23.490
site. We also have a large group of brothers and sisters from 21 different

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:29.449
countries to assist with project management, quality control, mechanical and

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:35.009
electrical installation and some of the finishes and builders trades. On weekends

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:39.610
volunteers from local congregations come into a system with site preparation

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:45.129
between the different phases. A good news reached Africa more than 100 years ago.

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:51.850
Since then, it has grown in many receptive hearts. Currently 3.5 million

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:57.370
Bible studies have been conducted in Africa. That is 30% of the global figure.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:03.490
This certainly shows that Jehovah is drawing people from every nation, tribe and

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:12.339
tongue to bring in praise. Exciting developments indeed. We are happy to see

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:17.740
how the kingdom preaching work is speeding up all over the world. And you may

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.459
have noticed that we decided to use outside contractors to help with this

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:28.180
particular project. Although we generally use our own construction workers, it

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:34.300
can sometimes be beneficial to use contractors on a case-by-case basis. At

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:42.550
times, that can speed up a project and result in savings. For a few moments, I

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:50.350
would like to speak to you on the theme. We continually remember your endurance.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:57.990
What is endurance? The original language word in the Greek scriptures has the

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:05.110
sense of standing one's ground and persevering, remaining steadfast under

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:11.670
trial. But it means even more than just toughing it out under a difficult

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:19.829
circumstance. The Christian who endures has genuine hope. He or she is convinced

00:07:19.829 --> 00:07:26.670
that as 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and verse 17 puts it, the tribulation is

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:35.910
momentary and light compared with the reward which is everlasting. To illustrate

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:42.949
the importance of endurance, you see before me a number of suitcases. Some are

00:07:42.949 --> 00:07:51.350
small, some are large. What we don't know is how heavy each one is. That depends

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:59.550
on what's inside. Some large suitcases can be surprisingly light. Some smaller

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:08.910
ones could be surprisingly heavy. In a sense, this illustrates what confronts each

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:17.149
one of us when we dedicate our life to Jehovah and start out on the race for life. At first,

00:08:17.149 --> 00:08:23.829
we may not know what loads will have to carry. We may worry about what might seem to be

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:29.990
big tests only to find that they're not as overwhelming as we feared they would be.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:37.429
On the other hand, some loads that we thought would be light, perhaps getting along with one

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:45.750
another in love, might be heavier to carry than we anticipated. Then there are unexpected

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:53.509
tests of our faith. Tests that could involve health problems, financial anxieties, family

00:08:53.509 --> 00:09:03.190
issues and personal disappointments. All such situations call for endurance. The governing

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:10.389
body wants you dear brothers and sisters to know that we love you for your steadfast endurance.

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:20.309
Our feelings are well summarized by Paul's words at 1 Thessalonians chapter 1 verses 2 and 3.

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:30.149
There he wrote to the faithful Christians, we always thank God when we mention all of you in our

00:09:30.149 --> 00:09:40.070
prayers, for we continually remember your faithful work, your loving labor, and your endurance

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:46.070
because of your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the presence of our God and Father.

00:09:47.029 --> 00:09:57.190
How beautifully these words convey our feelings about you. We are greatly encouraged and strengthened

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:05.350
by your faithfulness, your integrity, and your endurance. No matter what type of hardship you

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:15.190
are facing, two things are certain. Jehovah knows how heavy your load is and he can give you the

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:23.909
strength to carry it. Think about that first statement. Jehovah knows how heavy your load is.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:31.909
How do we know that? Open your Bible to Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 10.

00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:42.470
Here the Apostle Paul, himself, a wonderful example of endurance, tells us what makes our steadfast

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:47.429
endurance worthwhile. Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 10 says,

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:57.190
for God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:07.269
by ministering and continuing to minister to the holy ones. Imagine, Jehovah would consider it

00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:16.309
unrighteous to take your endurance for granted. In fact, Jehovah does more than acknowledge your work.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:26.870
He also helps you to carry your load. How do we know that? Open your Bible to Philippians chapter 4

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:38.840
verses 12 and 13 and notice here what the Apostle Paul, this model of endurance, tells us.

00:11:39.639 --> 00:11:47.480
Now just before we read it, perhaps we may think of Paul as being a newcomer to the Christian faith

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:57.240
and compared to many others, he was. But by the time he wrote to the Philippians in 60 or 61 CE,

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:06.360
Paul had encountered many obstacles. He had many heavy loads to carry. Paul mentions a few of them

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:13.639
in these verses, but then in the second half of verse 12, notice what Paul writes

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:23.080
in everything and in all circumstances. I have learned the secret of both how to be full

00:12:24.039 --> 00:12:30.039
and how to hunger, both how to have an abundance and how to do without.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:40.679
Now, notice what he says in verse 13, for all things, I have the strength through the one who

00:12:40.679 --> 00:12:49.799
gives me power. What does this mean for us? That whatever load we have to carry as a Christian,

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:58.519
we are not doing it with our own power. Jehovah will help us carry it. He will give us the

00:12:58.519 --> 00:13:08.200
needed strength. Paul knew that because he had experienced this from Jehovah first hand,

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:16.600
he had Jehovah's help in his life. How? Well, consider what Paul faced on his first missionary

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:24.440
tour. An exciting assignment laid before Paul, Barnabas, and their traveling companions.

00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:33.480
Would it be a light load full of only good experiences? Or would this assignment involve

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:42.759
challenges? Some perhaps heavier than he anticipated. Let's find out. One of Paul's first stops

00:13:42.759 --> 00:13:51.720
was Pesidian Antioch. Here, Paul and his companions had great success. In fact, the people begged

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:58.600
them to come back on the next Sabbath to tell them more. That seems like a light load to carry,

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:05.799
doesn't it? But Paul's return visit did not go as smoothly as he probably expected.

00:14:06.759 --> 00:14:14.279
While some accepted the good news, a poser stirred up the crowd to the extent that Paul and his

00:14:14.279 --> 00:14:23.240
companions were thrown out of the city. Paul's next stop was Iconium, about a one hundred mile

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:33.879
or 160 kilometer trip from Antioch. Paul couldn't take a train, a bus, or a taxi. He had to travel on foot.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:42.200
Did things go better for him when he got to Iconium? Would his preaching there be a lighter load to

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:51.240
carry than it was in Antioch? Well, some did accept his message, but then a poser stirred up

00:14:51.240 --> 00:15:00.600
opposition before long Paul and his companions had to flee again. This time, they walked 20 miles,

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:09.639
or about 30 kilometers to Listera. At first, things went well there. After Paul and Barnabas were

00:15:09.639 --> 00:15:17.480
mistaken for gods, they gave a skillful witness to the people of Listera about their powerful

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:28.039
creator. But then the imposers from Antioch and Iconium came after Paul. Some of them hated Paul so

00:15:28.039 --> 00:15:38.200
much. They walked over one hundred miles or 160 kilometers to attack him. When they found him,

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:43.639
they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, leaving him for dead.

00:15:44.919 --> 00:15:51.960
Did Paul think that this load was getting too heavy to carry? Did he cave into discouragement

00:15:51.960 --> 00:16:01.080
because imposers hated him and even attacked him physically? No. Paul had endurance.

00:16:01.879 --> 00:16:10.759
And a person who endures never gives up hope, even in the face of persecution. So what did Paul do?

00:16:11.799 --> 00:16:19.879
He continued right on with preaching. This time in Derby, just imagine the effort. Paul had

00:16:19.879 --> 00:16:28.759
to exert to walk the 60 miles or about 100 kilometers to Derby the day after he had almost been

00:16:28.759 --> 00:16:37.399
stoned to death. However, the trip was worth the effort because while in Derby, Paul and his

00:16:37.399 --> 00:16:48.120
companions made many disciples. As you can see, Paul had a heavy load to carry, but he didn't give up.

00:16:48.759 --> 00:16:58.919
He continued preaching, but then Paul did something more. Open your Bible to Acts chapter 14.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:09.720
Here we see something that proved Paul to be a man of endurance. At Acts chapter 14 and verse 21,

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:16.920
we read, after declaring the good news to that city and making quite a few disciples,

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:28.200
they returned to Listera, Iconium, and Antioch. Imagine Paul and his companions walked back

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:35.880
to the very cities where they had been viciously persecuted. Why? Verse 22 says,

00:17:36.839 --> 00:17:43.880
There they strengthened the disciples, encouraging them to remain in the faith and saying,

00:17:44.839 --> 00:17:54.440
we must enter into the kingdom of God through many tribulations. At first, that statement might seem

00:17:54.440 --> 00:18:01.960
strange. How could Paul encourage the disciples by telling them that they would have many tribulations?

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:10.519
That prospect would seem depressing, not encouraging, but look carefully at Paul's words.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:20.440
He didn't simply say, we must endure many tribulations. He said, we must enter into the

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:28.839
kingdom of God through many tribulations. In other words, Paul strengthened the disciples

00:18:28.839 --> 00:18:38.279
by emphasizing the positive result of endurance. As Jesus said at Matthew chapter 10 verse 22,

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:46.440
the one who has endured to the end will be saved. What's the lesson for us?

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:56.119
Endurance is not just a matter of toughing it out under a difficult situation. Endurance means

00:18:56.119 --> 00:19:03.720
keeping our hope bright in our mind. It means being personally convinced that as 2 Corinthians

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:14.920
chapter 4 and verse 17 says, the tribulation is momentary and light, but the reward is ever lasting.

00:19:16.119 --> 00:19:21.880
Would you like to see how some of your brothers and sisters are displaying that kind of endurance?

00:19:22.839 --> 00:19:30.200
We'd like to introduce you to brother Vasili Kalin, who was baptized for more than 50 years

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:37.480
and serves together with his wife Maria at the Russia branch. Has their load been easy to carry?

00:19:38.599 --> 00:19:51.660
This is their story. I was born in Ukraine to a family of Jehovah's Witnesses. When I was five,

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:58.299
our whole family was exiled to Siberia. Traveling in the same train was a little girl who 17

00:19:58.299 --> 00:20:04.859
years later would become my wife. That was Maria. We were married in 1968.

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:17.289
Under the Soviet Union, there was a ban on importing our publications. The congregations needed

00:20:17.289 --> 00:20:23.289
more literature and we wanted to help the brothers. So Maria and I decided that we would start printing

00:20:23.289 --> 00:20:30.569
the publications ourselves. I knew it would be risky because we had two young children.

00:20:30.569 --> 00:20:37.450
Our son was then only five years old and our daughter was less than a year old. We risked losing

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:45.690
our freedom and even our children. But we trusted in Jehovah to support us and we didn't think too

00:20:45.769 --> 00:20:50.970
hard about what could happen. If we have done that, we would just have given up.

00:20:54.569 --> 00:21:00.410
My biggest problem was that I had no experience with photo development whatsoever.

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:05.289
So what did I do? I bought a reference book and some equipment.

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:12.730
The circuit of the year gave me the microfilm that was used for duplicating literature.

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:19.769
Then one evening we tried printing the literature for the first time. Of course it was a complete mess.

00:21:19.769 --> 00:21:25.450
But in a little while we were able to start producing publications that were of good quality and

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:34.490
readable. Our work was highly confidential and we had to keep it a secret even from our family

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:40.890
who were all witnesses. Our work was done at night. We closed our curtains and turned off the lights.

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:43.930
We had a red lamp that gave us light while we were working.

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:49.450
When the literature was ready, we would deliver it in the morning to all the congregations.

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:55.769
It was also difficult and dangerous because if they caught us with literature,

00:21:55.769 --> 00:22:01.849
there was no doubt we would be sent to prison. We needed to travel dozens of kilometers.

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:08.569
I am very grateful to Maria that she often helped me. A brother would drive up in his car and

00:22:08.569 --> 00:22:14.730
I would pass on the literature to him. One time the brother was late. In Siberia it gets very cold.

00:22:15.609 --> 00:22:21.609
And I remember that it was snowing so heavily that I turned into a snow woman you could say.

00:22:21.609 --> 00:22:26.329
I couldn't go into a store to wear a mom because the brother could come any minute and we would miss

00:22:26.329 --> 00:22:28.569
each other. So I had to wait.

00:22:30.569 --> 00:22:35.769
When I would come back from work and Maria wasn't home, I would get very worried.

00:22:35.849 --> 00:22:38.730
Anything could have happened. Maybe she had been arrested.

00:22:39.849 --> 00:22:45.210
Sometimes our children knew that mama was a way to deliver in literature and they also got worried.

00:22:48.089 --> 00:22:55.769
Everything I have gone through has taught me never to rely on myself but instead to completely trust

00:22:55.769 --> 00:23:02.650
in Jehovah. We got a lot of joy out of the years we spent producing literature.

00:23:03.289 --> 00:23:10.329
We knew that our brothers and sisters were being fed spiritually. We are grateful to Jehovah

00:23:10.329 --> 00:23:14.329
that for 17 years we were able to print the publications.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:23.660
1991 was a landmark year for Jehovah's Witnesses in the Soviet Union. We received official

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:30.859
recognition. What a victory that was. Unfortunately, the situation with Jehovah's Witnesses today

00:23:30.859 --> 00:23:37.099
reminds me of the time we lived through. I see that Satan's methods have not changed but it is

00:23:37.099 --> 00:23:43.740
really encouraging to remember that Jehovah also has not changed. He defended and protected his

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:51.819
people in the past and he will do the same today. Did you notice how happy brother and sister

00:23:51.819 --> 00:23:59.900
Kalinar despite all the trials they've experienced? After all, what they went through was very serious.

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:08.940
It's just as James chapter 5 and verse 11 says, we consider happy those who have endured.

00:24:09.579 --> 00:24:16.700
What examples of faith brother and sister Kalinar? But it's not just older ones who are

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:23.660
showing faithful endurance. Many of you younger ones are standing your ground against opposition.

00:24:24.539 --> 00:24:32.779
For example, in South Korea, our brothers have been facing the neutrality issue since 1950.

00:24:33.579 --> 00:24:41.420
Since that time, over 18,000 have been imprisoned for their faith. Right now,

00:24:42.299 --> 00:24:50.140
607 of our brothers in South Korea are imprisoned for refusing to join the military.

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:59.900
Consider the Namkong family. This Christian family has three sons. The oldest has already finished

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:06.940
his prison sentence and been reunited with his family. The second son is currently in prison

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:14.299
and the youngest son will soon be required to take his stand. But in spite of these trials,

00:25:15.099 --> 00:25:27.910
this family is enduring without wavering. Because their boys they like to run around and play,

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:33.829
we play soccer together. In the winter, we enjoy skiing or snowboarding.

00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:39.349
From when they were young, we did our best to teach them basic morals from the Bible.

00:25:41.349 --> 00:25:46.869
My parents always reminded me that although they were hardships, I could be proud of being

00:25:46.869 --> 00:25:54.069
imprisoned because Jehovah highly values my stand for integrity. Knowing this gave me great comfort

00:25:54.069 --> 00:26:01.750
and encouragement. I stood in court twice. I was so nervous. I didn't know what to say.

00:26:02.869 --> 00:26:10.069
So I prayed and prayed. And sure enough, just as the scriptures promised, I was able to recall

00:26:10.069 --> 00:26:14.390
all the words I needed to say and gave a bold witness before the judge.

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:25.509
After the sentencing, my heart ached so much. My son had committed no crime but he had to live

00:26:25.509 --> 00:26:33.349
in a bad environment. Do her labor not be able to freely see those he loves. These thoughts kept

00:26:33.349 --> 00:26:41.829
going through my mind. It was unbearable. My brother wasn't where he would always be.

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:52.470
I remember being really sad. I kept thinking, my son did nothing wrong. Why does he have to go

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:58.150
through this? My heart hurts so much and there was no end to my tears.

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:05.589
I felt I needed to be strong for her. I never prayed so much for my wife as I did then.

00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:13.269
I prayed for Jehovah's help and for him to help my children maintain their integrity

00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:19.269
despite whatever hardship they faced. And when I prayed for comfort to calm my heart,

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:27.029
I felt a peace come over me. This convinced me that Jehovah was truly looking after my family.

00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:33.910
Also, when the brothers mentioned those maintaining neutrality and their closing prayers,

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:36.710
it really gave me great strength.

00:27:40.309 --> 00:27:45.349
As soon as I arrived in prison, I prayed to Jehovah to let me meet our brothers.

00:27:46.869 --> 00:27:51.430
Soon after, I saw a brother about my age walk through the prison door.

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:57.430
I was amazed that Jehovah took notice of even such minor issues

00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:06.230
and how quickly he answered my prayers. This helped me realize how much he really cares for me

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:09.829
and knowing this, helped me confront the challenges that lie ahead.

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:16.549
I still remember a comment that a brother made during one of our meetings in prison.

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:23.430
He talked about the means that Jehovah uses to provide help, that he speaks to us

00:28:23.509 --> 00:28:26.710
through our well-prepared comments and encouraging talks.

00:28:29.509 --> 00:28:34.069
Our middle son is in prison now. When I go to visit my son in prison,

00:28:34.069 --> 00:28:38.549
he tells me that he is encouraging the other brothers, conducting meetings,

00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:40.950
and feeling his spirituality is getting stronger.

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:52.490
I was young and the taunting words of the non-witnesses terrified me,

00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:57.369
not being able to see and have physical contact with my loved ones for over a year

00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:01.849
was the hardest part to endure. Despite difficult conditions,

00:29:01.849 --> 00:29:07.450
the brothers are doing their best to exalt Jehovah. We know that he is pleased with us

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:11.450
and watches over all the brothers who are maintaining their Christian neutrality.

00:29:14.089 --> 00:29:20.730
My sons have loyally maintained their integrity to Jehovah and they continue to set a good example.

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:25.930
That fact gives me great joy and happiness deep in my heart.

00:29:28.329 --> 00:29:34.089
Instead of viewing this as a trial, we see this as a way of demonstrating our faith to Jehovah.

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:40.089
I am convinced now that when we put spiritual things first in our lives,

00:29:40.089 --> 00:29:42.809
Jehovah will help us maintain our faith.

00:29:45.049 --> 00:29:49.849
Looking back on the experiences and trials that I face serving in prison for neutrality,

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:56.569
I feel more confident that I can overcome any difficulties that may lie ahead.

00:30:01.769 --> 00:30:05.769
I often receive letters from brothers and sisters around the world.

00:30:06.569 --> 00:30:11.849
They often write, the entire congregation and I, along with our Christian family around the

00:30:11.849 --> 00:30:18.490
world, are praying for you brothers in Korea to keep your integrity. I am very grateful for their

00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:24.170
prayers and interests and thank our loving father Jehovah for his constant care.

00:30:27.579 --> 00:30:33.099
Isn't it beautiful to see such a close, spiritually strong family?

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:39.339
Truly, they are enduring this painful situation with Jehovah's help.

00:30:40.299 --> 00:30:44.059
But maybe your endurance is related to something else.

00:30:45.339 --> 00:30:53.019
Open your Bible to 2 Corinthians chapter 12, which reveals another heavy load that the

00:30:53.019 --> 00:30:58.460
Apostle Paul had to carry. Beginning with verse 7, Paul writes,

00:30:59.259 --> 00:31:07.660
"...to keep me from becoming overly exalted, I was given a thorn in the flesh, an angel of Satan to

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:17.420
keep slapping me so that I might not be overly exalted. Three times, I begged the Lord about this,

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:25.180
that it would depart from me, but he said to me, my undeserved kindness is sufficient for you,

00:31:25.819 --> 00:31:34.059
for my power is being made perfect in weakness. What was Paul's thorn in the flesh?

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:42.460
We don't know for sure, but it may well have been a physical affliction, such as a problem with

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:50.539
Paul's eyesight. Many of you dear brothers and sisters are enduring chronic health problems.

00:31:51.339 --> 00:31:59.259
Perhaps you have been doing so for many years, like Paul, you may have prayed repeatedly that

00:31:59.259 --> 00:32:08.299
your thorn be removed. Never think that Jehovah is ignoring your prayers, or that he doesn't care

00:32:08.299 --> 00:32:16.220
about your situation. On the contrary, it may be that the answer to your prayer is the same one

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:25.019
that Paul received. In effect, Jehovah could be saying, my power is being made perfect in weakness.

00:32:25.819 --> 00:32:34.460
In other words, the fact that you are enduring is proof that Jehovah's power is supporting you

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:43.740
every day. Let's meet someone who illustrates that very point. Brother John Foster has served as a

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:52.779
member of the United States Bethel family for more than 50 years, but one day something unexpected

00:32:52.779 --> 00:33:08.630
happened that changed his life. I was baptized in 1958 in January the 11th at a high school in Detroit.

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:17.829
The ministry was very important to me because I've met the lives of individuals and so I

00:33:17.829 --> 00:33:28.549
considered it a priority to go out into the ministry. I applied for Bethel in 1962 at a district

00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:39.829
convention and I arrived there on my birthday in December of 28, 1962. I came to Bethel and I was

00:33:39.829 --> 00:33:50.470
determined to use my strength the best way possible and so I worked very hard to produce the

00:33:50.470 --> 00:34:01.269
publications because I realized that it made lives of individuals. It was a very good time for me

00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:13.670
because I could give a mile to Jehovah at a young age when I was strong and could carry out more.

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:26.969
In 2006 everything changed. That was in a Jehovah car accident. We were on our way to the congregation

00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:42.489
and we hit a tree. I got a broken neck and a broken leg and unfortunately the driver did not survive.

00:34:43.369 --> 00:34:54.409
The others that were in the car didn't receive injuries as severe. I was in the coma for three weeks.

00:34:54.409 --> 00:35:05.530
When I woke up I dealt with the pain of my recovery by witnessing people. I wanted to place literature

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:17.449
with the people in the hospital and almost seemed like an unworked feel. I placed a Bible

00:35:17.449 --> 00:35:26.489
teachbook with my surgeon and I told him that you saved my life so I want to save your life.

00:35:28.699 --> 00:35:36.539
If I was concerned after the accident whether Bethel would be able to use me in a meaningful way

00:35:36.539 --> 00:35:47.739
and not simply tolerate me, the responsibilities that I have now are to work with the books

00:35:47.739 --> 00:35:58.780
that have been printed from all over the world and we put them in archives as examples of the

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:08.219
printing that have been done. Another job that I have once in a while is to talk to departments

00:36:08.219 --> 00:36:20.630
and give them encouraging talks. I assume that I would heal and be better than I am now.

00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:28.550
I have been able to return to what I used to do but I was wrong in that.

00:36:30.389 --> 00:36:40.949
I feel that I'm doing the best I can so I feel comfortable. I wish I could do more but

00:36:41.829 --> 00:36:49.110
I just don't have the ability to do more and so I met peace with Jehovah. I think he

00:36:49.989 --> 00:36:56.070
understood. I know that he understands my situation and I'm doing the very best I can

00:36:56.869 --> 00:37:02.869
and that any real improvement is going to come from life in a new system of things.

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:12.550
So that's where my hope is that I'll make it to the new system of things and that I'll

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:25.210
yet see and prove to our perfect God really. Brother Foster is a beautiful example for us.

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:34.969
Although he is limited by his circumstances, he is not giving up. It is obvious that Jehovah is

00:37:34.969 --> 00:37:43.530
helping him to faithfully endure. Another test of faith that Paul had to endure is identified

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:55.690
at Romans 9 verses 2 to 4. Their Paul wrote, I have great grief and unceasing pain in my heart.

00:37:56.650 --> 00:38:04.250
For I could wish that I myself were separated from the Christ as the cursed one for the sake of my

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:13.369
brothers, my relatives according to the flesh who are Israelites. It hurt Paul that

00:38:13.369 --> 00:38:20.170
members of his own nation oppose the kingdom message and even persecuted those who proclaimed it.

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:29.130
Many of you brothers and sisters endure something similar when members of your own family

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:37.210
oppose your Christian course. Of course, this is to be expected because Jesus stated at Matthew

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:45.289
chapter 10 and verse 36, a man's enemies will be those of his own household.

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:54.409
The governing body commends you brothers and sisters who serve Jehovah despite opposition

00:38:54.409 --> 00:39:02.329
from members of your own family. To help you endure, we would like you to meet sister Priscilla

00:39:02.329 --> 00:39:11.610
Lagno from the United States. Her experience highlights what can result when we endure family

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:18.360
opposition. Paul and I were high school sweethearts and after two years of college we got married.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:25.800
We started a family, we had three beautiful children, we were very involved in our church and we

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:34.519
were very happy. Even so, I was searching. I remembered the scripture to Ephesians 4.5 that says

00:39:34.519 --> 00:39:42.599
there's only one true faith and so I wanted that. I wanted one true faith and so I prayed for God

00:39:42.599 --> 00:39:48.360
to help me. So that's when Jehovah's Witnesses knocked at my door and offered me a Bible study.

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:53.719
I really loved what I was learning. I started going to the meetings at the kingdom hall.

00:39:53.880 --> 00:40:03.159
I started making changes and those changes were good for my family but it wasn't making my husband

00:40:03.159 --> 00:40:11.719
very happy. He blamed me or my religion for any problem that came up. He even threatened that he

00:40:11.719 --> 00:40:18.519
would divorce me. Some of the things that Paul did to keep me from going to meetings or to slow me

00:40:18.599 --> 00:40:24.760
down was to hide my literature. He even took parts out of the car so I couldn't use the car to go.

00:40:26.599 --> 00:40:32.440
But one of the lowest points was when he would not let me take the children to the meetings with me.

00:40:33.159 --> 00:40:40.519
It bothered me because I felt it was my responsibility to make sure the children learned about

00:40:40.519 --> 00:40:47.480
Jehovah. So one memorial I took the children to the kingdom hall with me. Paul wasn't home

00:40:48.119 --> 00:40:53.960
to take care of them. That's why. And when we came out of the meeting there was a note on the car

00:40:53.960 --> 00:41:00.440
that said don't bother coming home. So we were able to go to a family member's house to spend the night.

00:41:01.159 --> 00:41:08.840
The next morning we got up and he said we could come home. So I told the kids to give him a hug.

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:17.320
We brought him a nice treat. And I remember praying with him. And I just did not want them

00:41:18.199 --> 00:41:23.079
to feel that their dad was a bad man. I wanted them to love their dad.

00:41:24.119 --> 00:41:30.360
At this point I really was convinced I had found the true religion or that one faith that I

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:35.719
had read about in the Bible. So what I did is I studied secretly with the children. I didn't want

00:41:35.719 --> 00:41:42.679
to make Paul upset. And as a result they were well behaved. They were happy. And Paul could see

00:41:42.679 --> 00:41:49.559
that. And eventually he allowed them to come to the meetings. So one day a Bethel couple invited

00:41:49.559 --> 00:41:55.800
Paul to tour Patterson. And because he was in construction work he was an engineer. He was very

00:41:55.800 --> 00:42:01.960
interested and very impressed with the work. So he agreed to go. And little by little he realized

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:09.000
that the witnesses, the Bethelites were just ordinary people. Then there was a big change

00:42:09.719 --> 00:42:15.960
that showed me that Jehovah had really been helping me all along. And I'm happy to say Paul can

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:22.440
tell you about it. Well yes, as Prasol said I'm an engineer and one day on one of our big jobs

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:28.280
we had a leak. I went to Jehovah in prayer and I made a bargain with him. And if he would help

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:35.480
find this leak I would go to one meeting with Prasola. Mind you she knew nothing about this prayer.

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:43.000
Well the very next day we found that leak. So that next Sunday out of the blue I told Prasola that

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.400
I was going to be going to a meeting with her. Well eventually started to go into meetings were

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:55.079
regularly. I started my own Bible study and in about a year later I got baptized. I realized over

00:42:55.159 --> 00:43:01.480
the years I was missing out on that happiness that both Prasola and the children had. So through

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:06.519
Prasola's kindness and submissive matter to me I started changing my view.

00:43:07.719 --> 00:43:13.880
Well Paul's retired now and we're still together and we're able to pioneer together which is

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:22.280
a real blessing. The children are all in full-time service and I just always remember that if you

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:29.559
trust in Jehovah rely on him he'll always help you endure. And I'm so thankful that Prasola

00:43:29.559 --> 00:43:36.440
stuck it out with me and now we have a spiritual family that I would never never want to give up.

00:43:38.199 --> 00:43:45.559
What a powerful lesson we can learn from Sister Lagno. Although 10 years went by before her husband

00:43:45.559 --> 00:43:55.719
joined her in the truth she trusted in Jehovah. We must never lose hope that even opposing family

00:43:55.719 --> 00:44:05.079
members may one day accept the truth. But sometimes we need to display endurance even if everyone

00:44:05.079 --> 00:44:14.039
in the family is in the truth. In this portrayal we will see how applying one specific Bible principle

00:44:14.039 --> 00:44:19.000
can do a lot to help a marriage mate who is going through a hard time.

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:26.679
As a family we have always served Jehovah together but something was changing in my husband.

00:44:29.699 --> 00:44:45.210
He said he was just burned out but he started to miss all of the meetings. I couldn't believe I was

00:44:45.210 --> 00:45:26.250
doing this by myself. The elders stopped by to encourage him but he didn't change. He stopped

00:45:26.329 --> 00:45:49.030
taking the lead spiritually. I was getting more and more upset. I tried to remind him of his

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:58.360
responsibilities as a spiritual head and what he should be doing but the more I said the worst

00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:15.940
things got and it drove him further away. I didn't know what to do. I was only seeing my own

00:46:16.019 --> 00:46:43.179
struggles. I didn't see his. After the meeting the elders encouraged me. They shared with me

00:46:43.179 --> 00:46:50.460
first Peter 3-1 which says if any or not obedient to the word they may be one without a word

00:46:51.099 --> 00:46:57.989
through the conduct of their wives. I could see there was another way to handle this situation.

00:46:59.590 --> 00:47:06.309
My attitude and actions can have a strong effect on my husband and showing empathy and compassion

00:47:06.309 --> 00:47:14.280
goes a long way. Even more than words. I thought about the Bible example of Abigail.

00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:43.829
Her husband, Nebel, was a worthless man. But Abigail was so patient. My husband was

00:47:43.829 --> 00:48:01.400
no Nebel. My husband was nothing like that. That night we had a good talk. I allowed him to express

00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:17.510
his feelings and I just listened. He was under more pressure than I realized. I told him not to feel

00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:27.420
any pressure from me and to come back when he's ready. I assured him that the kids and I love him

00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:56.679
very much. That assurance went a long way. Everyone was feeling better. Though it took some time

00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:13.500
things started changing for the better. My attitude and support went so much farther than any words

00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:38.469
ever could. When we apply Bible principles we don't always know what blessings may come about.

00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:09.690
I am forever thankful for Jehovah's guidance. Regardless of the outcome

00:50:10.409 --> 00:50:16.889
we are sure to have Jehovah's approval when we work hard to apply Bible principles.

00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:25.849
Expanding our ministry also requires endurance. We may need to learn a new language,

00:50:25.849 --> 00:50:33.050
a new culture, and adapt to very different living conditions. Consider the example of

00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:39.769
Denton and Janet Hopkinson. Brother Hopkinson currently serves as a member of the Philippine's

00:50:39.769 --> 00:50:48.809
Branch Committee. He was baptized in 1943 and has served in the Philippines for more than 60 years

00:50:49.449 --> 00:50:57.050
and Sister Hopkinson for more than 50 years. What challenges have they faced and what has

00:50:57.050 --> 00:51:08.840
helped them to endure? Let's find out. My mother learned the truth from a neighbor. I was 10 years old

00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:17.860
when I was baptized but then I became a pioneer when I was 16 years of age. My father and I were

00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:26.019
baptized at the same circuit assembly in October of 1950 and at that time I was 11 years old. I set

00:51:26.019 --> 00:51:32.579
a date after I finished high school to go into my pioneering and that's what I did. Later on of

00:51:32.579 --> 00:51:38.900
course I got an application to attend the 35th class of Gilead and I was still 20 at the time.

00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:47.699
After I had been pioneering for about three years I was called up for compulsory military service.

00:51:47.699 --> 00:51:54.099
Of course I refused to accept that but the judge sentenced me to six months in prison.

00:51:54.980 --> 00:52:01.219
And while I was in prison the application for Gilead was approved and the invitation came.

00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:08.500
Gilead was a wonderful experience and when we arrived in the Philippines we did not expect ever

00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:16.019
to return to our home country. Coming to the Philippines as a first port of call. That's the first

00:52:16.019 --> 00:52:23.619
time that I met Denton but my partner and I were going to Thailand. A arriving in Thailand was

00:52:23.619 --> 00:52:31.380
quite a change coming from a cold country. It was hot so that was a challenge to get used to.

00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:38.420
Brother Leech my partner and I we didn't learn much of the language in the first few months.

00:52:39.139 --> 00:52:47.460
Although I did try to learn by comparing the Let God be true book in English with the Let God be

00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:55.539
true book in Tagalog but that wasn't so easy because the grammar is so much different to English.

00:52:55.539 --> 00:53:04.420
After six months in the Philippines and we found a pile of letters on our desk in our room and

00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:11.219
that was our assignment to go into the circuit work. This was really a challenge for me is something

00:53:11.219 --> 00:53:18.820
new. I was only 22 years old at that time. I remember one time I went to a congregation and they

00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:25.300
showed me my room. It was just a plain room. It was a new house just newly built but it was just a

00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:34.739
wooden floor and four walls and that was it. In the corner a banik sleeping mat. In some cases

00:53:35.619 --> 00:53:44.340
there was a toilet outside the house mostly outside the house but in some cases there was no toilet

00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:56.179
at all so you just had to find your own way into the nearby countryside. After about two and a

00:53:56.179 --> 00:54:03.219
half years in the circuit work then I received the letter assigning me a district overseer and then

00:54:03.219 --> 00:54:10.179
oftentimes we have to travel by bus in some remote areas. I remember one time in Masbati the road

00:54:10.179 --> 00:54:18.630
was so rough and it was long it was much more difficult than it was in the circuit work. I had no

00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:25.989
vehicle to travel in. It was mostly public transportation. I've never owned a car in my life.

00:54:27.909 --> 00:54:35.510
He was while I was serving in the district work that I received the letter telling me to come to

00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:42.869
Bethel. When I came to Bethel brother Stuart the branch servant told me that I was to look after his

00:54:42.869 --> 00:54:49.909
work while he was away traveling to visit various countries in the zone work and I was really

00:54:50.869 --> 00:54:56.389
felt completely unprepared and unqualified for that kind of work at that time.

00:54:57.429 --> 00:55:03.989
After I was in Thailand for four years then and I had decided to get married and brother

00:55:03.989 --> 00:55:10.070
nor had agreed that I would be the one to be reassigned to the Philippines and we were married in

00:55:10.070 --> 00:55:18.820
1965. I have found that whatever assignment you're given in Jehovah's organization although it

00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:26.019
seems intimidating it seems to be difficult at the start but if you accept it and trust in Jehovah

00:55:26.659 --> 00:55:32.340
don't approach it as if you know everything or you can do it yourself but really trust in Jehovah

00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:39.780
to help you then you can succeed. The Jehovah's help we can all have the privileges of serving him

00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:44.420
and can all get the help of the Holy Spirit to continue to serve him faithfully.

00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:54.659
Sometimes brothers ask me how I was able to endure that long for 60 years in missionary service

00:55:54.659 --> 00:56:03.860
but I believe it is being willing to endure problems with the hope that things will improve as

00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:14.489
time goes by and Jehovah himself will give us a strength. How rewarding it is to spend a lifetime

00:56:14.489 --> 00:56:22.889
in Jehovah's service. On the video on demand section of JW Broadcasting you'll find another

00:56:22.889 --> 00:56:30.889
fine record of endurance. It's a fascinating video about the Stratton Ohio legal case that went

00:56:30.889 --> 00:56:38.570
all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States. The case came about after the village of Stratton

00:56:38.570 --> 00:56:45.849
required that Jehovah's witnesses obtain a permit before going from door to door. You will learn

00:56:45.849 --> 00:56:51.050
more about this case and hear actual recordings from the Supreme Court hearing.

00:56:53.769 --> 00:57:01.050
At one time or another we all have to endure the imperfections of our brothers and sisters.

00:57:02.090 --> 00:57:09.210
In this morning worship brother David Schaefer guides us to the principles that will help us to do so.

00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:17.289
Please open your Bibles to Philippians chapter four. If you are using an electronic device I

00:57:17.289 --> 00:57:23.369
invite you to do this by means of the JW Library app. Sometimes in our public ministry we have

00:57:23.369 --> 00:57:28.730
an opportunity to show people the difference between the King James version and the new world

00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:38.010
translation. If you tap the six on your iPad at Philippians four six you'll notice that the King James

00:57:38.010 --> 00:57:46.090
renders this verse be careful for nothing which sounds like an exhortation to worry needlessly

00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:53.050
exactly the opposite of what Philippians four six and seven is encouraging us to do. Namely do

00:57:53.050 --> 00:58:01.690
not be anxious over anything but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving

00:58:01.690 --> 00:58:08.969
let your petitions be made known to God and the peace of God that surpasses all understanding

00:58:08.969 --> 00:58:15.849
will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus. Now I invite you to use

00:58:15.849 --> 00:58:22.889
the bookmark feature of your JW Library as we'll return here but now regarding the comments in our

00:58:22.889 --> 00:58:32.250
text today that have to do with stumbling how is it what are some sorts of understanding that

00:58:32.889 --> 00:58:42.250
are surpassed by the peace of God. Sometimes when a person is mistreated he thinks and rightly so

00:58:42.889 --> 00:58:51.849
that this sort of thing ought not to happen in Jehovah's organization. How might the peace of God

00:58:51.849 --> 00:59:00.250
surpass that understanding? One way is that Jehovah reminds us through his word that sometimes

00:59:00.329 --> 00:59:09.130
things happen in Jehovah's organization that ought not to happen. Turn please to 1 Samuel chapter 24

00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:16.650
and verse two. Here young David was enduring persecution from Saul who had lost Jehovah's favor

00:59:16.650 --> 00:59:26.389
and who was jealous of David. Notice what happens here in verse two for Samuel 24 too. So Saul

00:59:26.389 --> 00:59:35.510
took 3,000 men chosen from all Israel and went to look for David and his men on the rocky cliffs

00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:45.429
of the mountain goats. Imagine that the king of Israel using Israel's army which was supported by

00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:57.429
dedicated funds to go after a personal enemy, an enemy of his who actually had Jehovah's favor.

00:59:57.429 --> 01:00:04.150
That was wrong on so many levels and it continued for years but the point is what was David's response

01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:11.269
to that? Was he bitter? Did he say you know there's no use even trying under circumstances like

01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:18.630
this? Well, no. On the contrary, he remained respectful of Saul's position as God's anointed one,

01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:25.510
refusing to attack even when he had many opportunities to do so. In fact, notice his actions in verse

01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:32.150
eight. Then David got up and went out from the cave and called out after Saul, my Lord the King,

01:00:32.789 --> 01:00:41.190
when Saul looked behind him, David bowed down low with his face to the ground and prostrated himself.

01:00:41.269 --> 01:00:48.150
David refused to allow bitterness to poison his heart or to compromise his integrity.

01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:54.150
But today we're living in a time when Jehovah's people as a whole can never be corrupted.

01:00:54.949 --> 01:01:04.230
So how is it that this brother who disappointed me can maintain a good standing? That is a form

01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:11.190
of understanding. How does the peace of God surpass that understanding? Well, one way

01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:15.349
is that it brings back to our minds that the Christian Greek scriptures are full of counsel

01:01:16.070 --> 01:01:23.110
directed to us to help us put up with those who have given us a legitimate cause for complaint.

01:01:23.110 --> 01:01:28.070
So we shouldn't be surprised if occasionally one of our brothers or sisters is lacking in some

01:01:28.070 --> 01:01:34.949
Christian quality. Is it possible that applying the words of Philippians chapter four in verse eight

01:01:34.949 --> 01:01:41.269
will help us? A lot has to do with the way we direct our thoughts. If you have enabled your

01:01:41.269 --> 01:01:47.510
electronic bookmark, you can just tap it and go back to Philippians chapter four. And while you're

01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:55.190
tapping, tap the eight for the kingdom interlinear rendering, the main text of Philippians for eight

01:01:55.190 --> 01:02:01.110
reads, finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are of serious concern,

01:02:01.110 --> 01:02:05.829
whatever things are righteous, whatever things are chased, whatever things are lovable,

01:02:06.869 --> 01:02:12.309
continue considering these things. But notice that the kingdom interlinear instead of lovable

01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:21.349
uses the expression affection inducing. Jehovah wants us to consider what is good in people.

01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:27.989
To focus on that which induces our affection for them rather than our resentment and the article

01:02:27.989 --> 01:02:33.590
finding the key to brotherly affection in the October 15, 1993 issue of the watchtower,

01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:41.989
the watchtower boiled the whole process down to one word appreciation. Appreciation is the key

01:02:41.989 --> 01:02:49.429
to brotherly affection. Yes, I'm hurt. However, is there something? Anything that I, that God or

01:02:49.429 --> 01:02:58.070
others sees in this brother and appreciates? Can I see it? Is he seeking first the kingdom?

01:02:58.070 --> 01:03:02.070
He didn't have to make himself available to Jehovah to serve here at Bethel, but he has.

01:03:03.110 --> 01:03:08.389
Is he putting up a good fight against our three common enemies, Satan the devil, the flesh,

01:03:08.389 --> 01:03:15.190
the world? Despite where he has come from in life and what he is presently going through,

01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:22.789
is he not really doing his best? Continue considering the affection inducing things.

01:03:23.829 --> 01:03:28.070
Moreover, notice what it says right here in Philippians chapter 4 and verse 13.

01:03:30.659 --> 01:03:39.059
For all things, I have the strength through the one who gives me power. Oh, true, when an offense is

01:03:39.059 --> 01:03:44.659
a major sin, it's understandable that we would take steps to initiate the appropriate congregation

01:03:44.659 --> 01:03:50.579
action, but we should always remember that Jehovah gives us the strength we need to serve him

01:03:50.579 --> 01:03:57.460
even under difficult circumstances. There's never a reason to stop serving Jehovah. We should always

01:03:57.460 --> 01:04:03.539
be ready to ask Jehovah for his help, particularly if it seems that something is going to interfere

01:04:03.539 --> 01:04:10.820
with our feelings for him and our stand for his kingdom. Always ready to ask Jehovah for help.

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:16.179
Indeed, we should be careful for nothing, not in the sense of worrying needlessly,

01:04:16.179 --> 01:04:23.860
but in the sense of our days text that we keep on asking Jehovah, not being anxious over anything,

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:30.179
but letting our petitions be made known to God with the confidence that he will supply us the

01:04:30.179 --> 01:04:39.510
strength that we need to remain firm and do his will. In Bible times and today, many have

01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:47.190
encouraged themselves to endure by singing spiritual songs. You may recall that when Paul and

01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:57.750
Silas were in prison, Acts 1625 says they were praying and praising God with song. We know they must

01:04:57.750 --> 01:05:04.550
have sung out with their whole hearts because the verse goes on to say that the prisoners were

01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:14.949
listening to them. Yes, even in the darkest moments, singing spiritual songs can lift our spirits.

01:05:15.909 --> 01:05:23.510
That's why I'm convinced that you will enjoy this music video that in a few words summarizes the

01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:29.670
message of this month's program. The song is called Never Give Up.

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:51.079
The words that were said by your son, if they persecuted me, then they'll do it to you.

01:05:51.079 --> 01:05:59.320
It's not a surprise, really nothing that's new. Jehovah, I pray, please let me be strong.

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:07.079
My life and devotion to you, they belong. My record of faith will never be lost.

01:06:07.079 --> 01:06:16.300
I'll be loyal to you no matter the call. I'll never give in to talk or to

01:06:16.300 --> 01:08:03.610
breath enduring in vain. The sufferings fail, I fail. Brothers and sisters,

01:08:04.650 --> 01:08:10.010
please remember that no matter what situation you may be enduring,

01:08:10.809 --> 01:08:19.210
Jehovah will never abandon you. He will always be there to strengthen and sustain you.

01:08:20.329 --> 01:08:34.359
Never forget what Jehovah promises at Isaiah chapter 41 and verse 10. Do not be afraid for I am with

01:08:34.359 --> 01:08:46.279
you. Do not be anxious for I am your God. I will fortify you. Yes, I will help you. I will

01:08:46.279 --> 01:08:52.119
really hold on to you with my right hand of righteousness.

01:08:54.039 --> 01:09:01.720
We hope that this program has assured all of you that the governing body truly loves each

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:14.949
one of you and that we notice and appreciate your steadfast endurance. To conclude,

01:09:15.670 --> 01:09:22.630
we would like to take you to a remote part of Southern Chile. We have greetings from the 23

01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:31.189
publishers that live in the town of Cochran. Seven of them are pioneers. The local congregation

01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:38.470
has two elders and three ministerial servants taking the lead. A number of the publishers regularly

01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:46.310
overcome great distances and other obstacles to attend the meetings. One family travels for an

01:09:46.310 --> 01:09:54.470
hour by boat, followed by over two hours in a four by four vehicle. And when there is too much

01:09:54.470 --> 01:10:02.390
snow for them to drive, they arrive on horseback. We thank you for joining us this month.

01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:10.630
This is JW Broadcasting from Brooklyn, New York.
