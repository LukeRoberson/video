00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:13.400
I've been an insecure and reserved person since childhood.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:21.679
When I finished school, my report said that I was unable to express myself and that I had a limited vocabulary.

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.679
These words injured my already low self-esteem.

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:28.679
So I started to wonder, what am I living for?

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:36.390
During my teenage years, I began to drink alcohol.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.390
Life seemed meaningless to me.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.390
I felt depressed and started to have suicidal thoughts.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:53.380
When I was around 20, I became obsessed with hard rock.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.380
This music really charged me with energy.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:02.649
I loved its roughness and rapidness.

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.650
It whipped me into a frenzy.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.819
In time, I became rude and aggressive.

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:13.819
I often quarreled with those close to me.

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:17.819
This, of course, did not bring me happiness.

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:22.819
I started to have suicidal thoughts again, but serious ones this time.

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:28.819
The only thing that stopped me was the thought that my mom would not survive it.

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:34.819
I tried to take my mind off these thoughts, and I began to want to do something for God.

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:39.819
For the first time in my life, I poured out my heart to God in prayer.

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:43.819
I asked Him to help me find my purpose in life.

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:50.819
Just two hours later, Jehovah's Witnesses knocked on my door and offered a Bible study.

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.819
That's how my new, happy life began.

00:01:54.819 --> 00:02:03.359
Although it wasn't easy for me, I got rid of everything that was related to hard rock and alcohol.

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:07.359
I thought that I would never be able to tell others about my faith.

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:12.360
At the same time, however, I understood that people needed to hear about it.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.360
But to my surprise, my preaching gave me confidence.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.360
It also strengthened my faith.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.360
Now I have a good family.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.360
I'm happy that I've been able to help people, including my sister and mom, to learn the truth from the Bible.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:37.120
Throughout my life as a Christian, Jehovah's words at Hebrews 13.5 have greatly supported me.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.120
I will never leave you, and I will never abandon you.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.120
And He didn't abandon me, even when I did not know Him.
