00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:04.250
What do you see when you look at this picture?

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.250
Do you see yourself in it?

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.769
You should.

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:10.529
But why?

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:16.530
This picture helps us to visualize the beautiful description of Jehovah found at Isaiah 40

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.329
verse 11.

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:22.170
Like a shepherd, he will care for his flock.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.929
With his arm, he will gather to gather the lambs.

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:29.329
And in his bosom, he will carry them.

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.810
He will gently lead those nursing there young.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:39.090
Jehovah bears many titles in the Bible, but the designation shepherd is among the most

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.729
tender.

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:47.409
Like a shepherd, Jehovah says he will carry his lambs in his bosom, illustrating his

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:52.729
tender love and care for each one of his precious sheep.

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:55.090
Look again at the picture.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:01.250
Is it hard for you to see yourself as a lamb nestled in the bosom of our shepherd, Jehovah?

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.329
We know that many of you dear brothers and sisters are coping with very difficult challenges

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:11.250
day after day in this cruel wicked world.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.890
Such challenges can make it difficult for you to feel like a lamb safe and secure in

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.769
the bosom of our shepherd.

00:01:19.769 --> 00:01:26.890
Please be assured that Jehovah is fully aware of every challenge you face.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.409
Why can you be so sure?

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.010
Let's read with David, the writer of Psalm 23 verse 4 says,

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.489
Though I walk in the valley of deep shadow, I fear no harm.

00:01:39.489 --> 00:01:47.010
For you are with me, your rod and your staff reassure me.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:52.450
Much like a physical valley located deep in the shadows of nearby mountains, a figurative

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.650
valley can be used to describe a low point in one's life when we're feeling down, gloomy,

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.409
or in a dark place.

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.449
When David wrote this song, he was feeling down at a low point in his life.

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:13.490
Well, what valley of deep shadow are you currently going through?

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.889
Are you feeling overwhelmed with trying to provide for your family's needs?

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:23.689
Dealing with a serious health issue such as cancer?

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:29.330
Exhausted because you're caring for your mate or a parent with dementia?

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.689
Trying to cope with the death of a loved one?

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:41.129
Baddling feelings of loneliness, worthlessness, or anxiety, or facing persecution?

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:48.289
It's so difficult to remain positive when facing the darkest days of our life.

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:50.250
But there's a bright side.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.250
What is that?

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.250
Jehovah is aware of the mountain-like obstacles that cause you to feel low as if you were in

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.650
a valley of deep shadow.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.129
He not only sees your pain, but he's ready to come to your rescue, lift you up with

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:12.650
his strong arms and embrace you like that lamb in the picture.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:19.409
Psalm 23 is one of the most well-known passages in the Bible, and beautifully describes the

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:27.409
loving way that our shepherd Jehovah leads, protects, and feeds his precious sheep.

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:32.610
As we consider these three ways that Jehovah cares for us, look for the answers to the

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.009
following questions.

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:37.449
What does Jehovah do?

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:39.090
How does he do it?

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.449
And what do you need to do?

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:44.129
The first way.

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:47.129
Our shepherd leads us.

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:54.650
At Psalm 231, the theme of our discussion, David expressed with full confidence, Jehovah

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.129
is my shepherd.

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:58.370
I will lack nothing.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.849
As a young man, David proved to be a capable shepherd who tenderly cared for and protected

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:11.090
his entire flock and cared for the specific needs of each sheep.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:18.170
Here in Psalm 23, David portrays himself not as a shepherd, but as a humble sheep under

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:25.529
the loving care of Jehovah, affectionately calling him my shepherd.

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:33.610
During his lifetime, David experienced many highs and lows, peaks, valleys, joys, and

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.529
disappointments.

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:42.129
But whatever value of deep shadow he faced, David always relied on his shepherd to lead

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:49.250
into safety and provide exactly what he needed when he needed it.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:55.209
With complete trust and confidence, he said, I will lack nothing.

00:04:55.209 --> 00:05:02.660
No wonder Psalm 23 has been called a psalm of assurance or trust.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.860
What does our shepherd do?

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.500
Verses two and three answer.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.980
In grassy pastures, he makes me lie down.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.660
He leads me to well-watered resting places.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.819
He refreshes me.

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:21.420
He leads me in the paths of righteousness for the sake of his name.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:28.459
The watchtower once explained, David here paints a scene of contentment, refreshment, and

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:31.060
security.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.500
Jehovah leads us to grassy pastures and tranquil waters.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.899
The Hebrew word rendered pastures can mean pleasant place.

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:46.819
If we humbly follow our shepherd, he will lead us to a pleasant place where we can feel

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:54.180
secure and have peace of mind, even when we're going through a valley of deep shadow.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.660
How does Jehovah lead us?

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:02.660
By means of his word, he teaches us how to make wise decisions that lead to paths of

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:09.459
righteousness, a life course that is pleasing to him and brings us happiness.

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:15.459
He sets a course and a pace that we're able to follow, never expecting us to do more

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:17.860
than we're able.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:25.660
Jehovah also leads us by means of undershepherds, the elders, who tenderly care for a spiritually,

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:31.699
emotionally and physically, so that we will lack nothing.

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:34.060
What do you need to do?

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:39.620
If you're going through a valley of deep shadow, search our many publications for specific

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:45.620
Bible principles and helpful advice that can shed light on your present circumstances

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:54.259
and provide practical ways to overcome difficulties or give you the patience to endure.

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:58.860
We find encouragement and comfort watching JW Broadcasting.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:05.500
In fact, once Sister said, JW Broadcasting has helped me to be more positive.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:10.180
When I get lonely or discouraged, I find an encouraging talk or a morning worship

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.529
program to watch.

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:20.129
Are you benefiting from the monthly broadcasts, videos, and uplifting songs?

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:21.649
The second way.

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:24.769
Our shepherd protects us.

00:07:24.769 --> 00:07:28.449
Let's read the second half of verse 4.

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:32.730
Your rod and your staff reassure me.

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:38.050
David used a shepherd's rod and staff to illustrate Jehovah's protective care.

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:44.290
Ancient shepherds used a rod to protect their sheep from predators, such as lions, bears,

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.529
wolves, and snakes.

00:07:46.529 --> 00:07:53.370
They also used a staff to guide their sheep, gently nudging them in the right direction.

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:58.769
Interestingly, some staffs had a hook at the end of the long stick that helped them as

00:07:58.769 --> 00:08:05.689
a shepherd gently draw back a sheep strain or nibbling into danger, guiding them back

00:08:05.689 --> 00:08:08.730
to the protection of the flock.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:15.290
The sheep certainly did not fear that the shepherd would use his rod or staff to beat them.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.449
What does Jehovah do?

00:08:17.449 --> 00:08:23.329
Our loving shepherd stands ready to use his figure of rod and staff to warn and protect

00:08:23.329 --> 00:08:30.250
us from predators seeking to harm us, especially from Satan, who in the Bible is portrayed

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:34.809
as a vicious lion and a cunning serpent.

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:41.730
Jehovah also has appointed elders in the congregation to warn and protect us from harmful influences

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:46.610
and from taking a dangerous path in this wicked world.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:52.370
No doubt, you're filled with heartfelt appreciation and are comforted knowing that Jehovah

00:08:52.409 --> 00:08:59.769
is always on the lookout to use his figure of rod and staff to warn and protect us, not

00:08:59.769 --> 00:09:02.210
to beat us.

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:09.809
If you strayed or nibbled away from the flock for whatever reason, please listen to Jehovah

00:09:09.809 --> 00:09:15.649
as he speaks to you through his written word, the Bible, and our brotherhood.

00:09:15.649 --> 00:09:21.450
Humbly follow the gentle nudging to lead you back to the safety of the congregation, where

00:09:21.529 --> 00:09:29.570
you'll enjoy lush, grassy pastures and refreshing, well-watered resting places.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:36.889
Elders, you are entrusted with a privilege but a heavy responsibility to protect Jehovah's

00:09:36.889 --> 00:09:41.409
precious sheep, whom he's placed under your care.

00:09:41.409 --> 00:09:47.210
We take this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation for those of you who use your

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:54.490
figurative rod and staff to protect the sheep, never making them feel beaten down but truly

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:58.409
loved and appreciated.

00:09:58.409 --> 00:10:00.929
How does Jehovah protect us?

00:10:00.929 --> 00:10:05.330
He protects us as a group or flock.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:10.450
Satan will never succeed in wiping Jehovah's sheep from the earth.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:14.289
Jehovah also protects each sheep individually.

00:10:14.289 --> 00:10:15.889
How?

00:10:15.889 --> 00:10:19.850
Most important, he protects us spiritually.

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:26.450
The draw close to Jehovah book explains, our loving God protects us from spiritual harm

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:32.009
by equipping us with what we need in order to endure trials and to safeguard our relationship

00:10:32.009 --> 00:10:33.330
with him.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:41.649
Jehovah thus works to preserve our life, not just for a few short years, but for eternity.

00:10:41.649 --> 00:10:47.690
How reassuring that Jehovah makes sure that we have everything we need so that we will

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:52.090
in effect lack nothing?

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:54.450
What do you need to do?

00:10:54.450 --> 00:11:00.769
Take full advantage of the many provisions Jehovah makes available to protect us spiritually,

00:11:00.769 --> 00:11:08.289
prayer, fellow worshippers, and timely spiritual food which we'll discuss next.

00:11:08.289 --> 00:11:12.769
The third way, our shepherd feeds us.

00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:20.370
Psalm 23 verses 5 and 6 reassures us, you prepare a table for me before my enemies.

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:22.970
You refresh my head with oil.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.529
My cup is well filled.

00:11:25.529 --> 00:11:31.289
Surely goodness and loyal love will pursue me all the days of my life and I will dwell

00:11:31.289 --> 00:11:34.929
in the house of Jehovah for all my days.

00:11:34.929 --> 00:11:37.289
What does Jehovah do?

00:11:37.289 --> 00:11:43.730
Jehovah now describes our shepherd as a generous host who spreads before us his invited guests

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:49.850
delicious and nutritious food and drink in great abundance.

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:52.289
How does Jehovah feed us?

00:11:52.289 --> 00:11:57.250
Through the faithful and discreet slave, Jehovah gives us timely publications as well as

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:05.330
rich spiritual programs at our meetings, assemblies, conventions, JW broadcasting, governing

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:11.370
body updates, along with encouraging songs and videos, and so much more.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:18.850
Truly, the slave is giving us food at the proper time, what we need when we need it.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:23.090
We certainly lack nothing spiritually.

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:25.570
What do you need to do?

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:32.490
Show your appreciation for the food the slave provides by eating it and never being fussy,

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:35.409
picky or selective in your eating habits.

00:12:35.409 --> 00:12:41.730
Remember, the Bible and Bible-based publications are ways that Jehovah speaks to us in

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:47.409
effect saying, this is the way, walk in it, my precious sheep.

00:12:47.409 --> 00:12:53.490
As we read the Bible and meditate on the verses that touch our heart, we'll be better equipped

00:12:53.490 --> 00:13:01.289
to correct any faulty thinking that could lead us to dark feelings of anxiety, loneliness,

00:13:01.289 --> 00:13:05.850
worthlessness, anger or resentment.

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:12.129
Like David, be determined to dwell in the house of Jehovah for all your days.

00:13:12.129 --> 00:13:17.769
Continue attending our upbuilding meetings, assemblies and conventions, where we receive

00:13:17.769 --> 00:13:21.809
spiritual nourishment and protection.

00:13:21.809 --> 00:13:27.169
A sister who has traversed various valleys of deep shadow, expressed what helps her to

00:13:27.169 --> 00:13:30.809
stay focused and keep on enduring.

00:13:30.809 --> 00:13:37.769
She said, depressive thoughts are not trustworthy, they are the product of a treacherous heart

00:13:37.769 --> 00:13:40.850
that distorts our thinking abilities.

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:47.970
But because I trust Jehovah completely, each Bible verse proves to be like a solid stepping

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:55.450
stone that enables me to gradually climb out of my many valleys of deep shadow.

00:13:55.450 --> 00:14:02.210
Our sister expressed so well how we feel about our loving shepherd who promises to help

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:07.730
us successfully navigate through any valley of deep shadow.

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:11.730
Isn't this a beautiful picture of a shepherd with his sheep?

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:16.809
It's a door in the governing body conference room since the 1970s.

00:14:16.809 --> 00:14:22.330
It's a visual reminder of the importance of their work as shepherds.

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:28.009
Another loach, a member of the governing body since 1994, recently explained what this

00:14:28.009 --> 00:14:32.570
inspiring painting has meant to him throughout the decades.

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:35.370
Enjoy the following video segment.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:42.169
This painting in the governing body conference room shows the shepherd and his sheep and

00:14:42.169 --> 00:14:49.289
the shepherd is caring for the sheep and they feel obviously comfortable and protected.

00:14:49.289 --> 00:14:56.649
They do that despite, as you can see in the background, stormy weather, but the sheep feel

00:14:56.649 --> 00:14:57.970
just fine.

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:04.889
In connection with the application in the Bible, the Bible shows that Jehovah God is a shepherd

00:15:04.889 --> 00:15:07.809
and cares for us as his sheep.

00:15:07.809 --> 00:15:12.090
But so is Jesus Christ, he is called the fine shepherd.

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:15.090
And what are shepherds to do?

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:25.970
Shepherds lead the sheep, feed the sheep, shepherds protect the sheep, but then shepherds

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:30.490
also care for injured or ailing sheep.

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:34.809
But the fact is that all of God's people are sheep.

00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:42.970
And so we have the privilege to follow the lead of Jehovah and Jesus and the elders and

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:45.169
work together in unity.

00:15:45.169 --> 00:15:56.490
At the governing body meeting, we sometimes look at the picture and we try to apply what

00:15:56.490 --> 00:16:03.889
is implied in the painting to our work with the congregations and the worldwide flock.

00:16:03.889 --> 00:16:08.570
Thank you, brother Loach, for sharing those encouraging comments with us.

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:13.970
How reassuring it is to know that our loving shepherds on the governing body take their

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:21.490
responsibility to lead, protect, and feed you, me, and all of Jehovah's precious sheep

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:23.570
very seriously.

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:29.730
May we all continue to humbly and obediently follow their lead as we follow closely the

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:36.009
lead of our great shepherd Jehovah and in the footsteps of our fine shepherd and king,

00:16:36.009 --> 00:16:38.009
Jesus.

00:16:38.009 --> 00:16:46.009
Never forget that Jehovah is not just our shepherd, he is your shepherd, he is my shepherd.

00:16:46.009 --> 00:16:52.450
With Jehovah our shepherd leading, protecting, and feeding us, we can face the future with

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:58.169
complete confidence and echo the words that David used to introduce this beautiful and

00:16:58.169 --> 00:16:59.889
reassuring Psalm.

00:16:59.889 --> 00:17:06.170
The words contained at Psalm 23, Jehovah is my shepherd, I will lack nothing.
