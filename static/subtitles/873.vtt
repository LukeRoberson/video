00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.979
we love what we're learning and I feel like we finally have something we're doing together

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:33.539
but we have a question shoot so we're with my folks and they start talking about how bad the world

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.419

SKI I know we're not pioneering yet but eventually why not

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:47.439
think how far we've come we thought we'd never speak up about the truth but we did

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.560
and it took a while to shift our priorities but the ministry is part of our life now

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.560
and did we ever imagine starting Bible studies every time we thought we couldn't

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:07.839
Jehovah showed us that we could why not sit the bull and see where he takes us

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:27.360
