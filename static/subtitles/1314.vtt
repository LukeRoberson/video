WEBVTT

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:11.539
Received the phone call, inviting myself and some other brothers back to Brooklyn, New York in October of 2012.

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:16.539
We were the branches planning a international convention in the year 2014.

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.539
We needed a venue, we needed adequate parking, we needed adequate hotel space,

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.539
and all of those pieces had to fit together in one location.

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.539
The full scope of it was explained to us.

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.539
I just remembered going back to my room that night and says,

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.539
what's going to happen?

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:38.539
To have 16 international conventions, and then with five of the weekends,

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:45.539
having dual cities going on at the same time, and each one streaming to various regionals.

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:52.539
But also to understand the importance of talking to more than just management of a facility,

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.539
to go to city government, to go to convention bureaus, the hotel community,

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.539
the restaurant community.

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.539
25 years since we've been in the area, we don't know them, they don't know us.

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.540
How are we going to realistically meet these challenges based on the deadlines that we have?

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.540
Well, there are literally hundreds of brothers involved.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.540
There was a whole team working on nothing but hotels.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.540
There was a contract team working with government officials, home land security,

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.540
city officials and the like, and building management.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:30.329
There were some concerns because it is an organization that we haven't dealt with in the past.

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:37.329
And generally speaking, we reserved the asset for sports related activities.

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.329
We've investigated some of the major facilities here in Atlanta.

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:47.329
And they've been too pricey at various kinds of restrictions, obstacles we had to overcome.

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.329
We didn't have a lot of success in downtown Atlanta.

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.329
It's not in Atlanta Falcons football game, it's certainly not a college football game.

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.329
This is a different type of event that has a lot of different challenges.

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:06.329
So overcoming the first logistic of actually being able to provide dates was the biggest hurdle.

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.330
They'll be using Ford Field, which is a great facility.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.330
They're going to have 45,000 people.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.330
The parking that's going to be required is tremendous.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.330
This is the first time that we've ever hosted a large-scale religious event or convention at the stadium.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.330
Well, there was a lot of things that we had to figure out.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.330
The type of video systems they had, how to interact with the audio system.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.330
We needed to go see the airport management people at the three airports in Washington DC

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:39.330
to see what their protocol was for us to have a welcome committee at the airports when the flights arrived.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:46.330
And as we spoke to all the major hotels down here, they were a little reluctant to give us what we wanted.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.330
Most conventions do not follow through on their room blocks, and they didn't believe us.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:59.330
Well, we've never done anything this large on this type of a scope, technology-wise.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.330
The challenges that we had to overcome are a little unique to Jehovah Witnesses because of your ability to self-serve.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.330
The challenge was getting everybody to ride mod, rather than drive their own automobiles.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:16.330
The first things that we did was to help them appreciate that Jehovah's Witnesses are different as a client.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.330
And not pushing a contract right away, beginning their confidence.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.330
And once they saw that we were real, we're genuine, we're honest, we're different.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.330
And because of who we are than anybody else, they began to trust us.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.330
And that trust grew and grew and grew.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.330
We talked about this concept of a partnership.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.330
So we're not here with Hatten Hand.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.330
We're here to say what we can do to benefit you as well as you benefit us.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.330
Nobody's been pushy, so this is one of the more pleasurable events that I've had the experience of working with.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.330
They needed to know that we were equal to the task.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.330
This is not something is the first time for us.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.330
We'd hold annual conventions, 300 plus a year in the United States.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.330
We're the largest convention meeting organization, not only here, but throughout the world.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.330
We let them know right away that we wanted to cooperate with them.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.330
It came to see me and suggested they wanted to have a big convention here.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.330
And I said yes, I took them down to meet the city manager and he said yes.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.329
I didn't hear anything else until the convention started.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.329
So they just did all the work in the background and it was no hassle for us.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:29.329
The community knows the financial advantages, but the University of Washington was extremely interested in our program.

00:04:29.329 --> 00:04:35.329
And the fact that we taught family values how to become better parents, better children.

00:04:35.329 --> 00:04:38.329
This is a perfect type of event for our city.

00:04:38.329 --> 00:04:45.329
Arlington and AT&T Stadium is really a very unique place to have a convention like the Jova's Witness Convention here.

00:04:45.329 --> 00:04:51.329
One of the good things about having the your convention in Houston is that we've got some great venues for that.

00:04:51.329 --> 00:04:56.329
Certainly this event cannot be housed in a small hotel ballroom or certainly one of the small kingdom halls.

00:04:56.329 --> 00:05:00.329
And so there's a lot of coordination and enormous amount of details.

00:05:00.329 --> 00:05:07.329
And working with the Jova's Witnesses organization, you'll never find a group that takes on so much ownership

00:05:07.329 --> 00:05:09.329
as the Jova's Witnesses do.

00:05:09.329 --> 00:05:15.329
We had to count all the bathrooms, all the soap dispensers, trash cans, and recycle bins to the side.

00:05:15.329 --> 00:05:17.329
How many volunteers we needed.

00:05:17.329 --> 00:05:20.329
We were friendly first. They were friendly in return.

00:05:20.329 --> 00:05:23.329
So it's just like we've been taught at the Theocratic Ministry School.

00:05:23.329 --> 00:05:28.329
The way you conduct yourself and handle yourself generally can break down some barriers.

00:05:28.329 --> 00:05:31.329
Because the governing body, the convention office, they've trained us.

00:05:31.329 --> 00:05:35.329
They've always been there for us because of their experience in relying on Jehovah.

00:05:35.329 --> 00:05:37.329
They were a phone call away even on the weekends.

00:05:37.329 --> 00:05:40.329
The governing body is chosen the places that they want.

00:05:40.329 --> 00:05:43.329
And with his help, Jehovah's Spirit, it can be accomplished.

00:05:43.329 --> 00:05:46.329
And so we went with a positive attitude and that worked.

00:05:46.329 --> 00:05:49.329
Little things have to happen sometimes. Details are critical.

00:05:49.329 --> 00:05:56.329
And when those things fall into place, you just say, wow, that didn't just happen all by itself.

00:05:56.329 --> 00:06:07.819
It made my job easy how much time and effort that they put into it and how they were willing to do anything

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:09.819
to make sure that it was successful.

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:13.819
The Jehovah's Witness Convention had everything organized very well organized.

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:15.819
The planning was exceptional.

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:20.819
Each day we had something like 300 volunteers in each in the model stations.

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:23.819
With signs on how to direct the friends.

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:25.819
Volunteers have been superb.

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:27.819
So we've appreciated having them here at modern.

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:33.819
We were able to go out and work with parking venues, the city of Detroit, to secure the parking that would be required.

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:41.819
On Thursday prior to the convention starting, we requested a little over 3,000 volunteers.

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:45.819
But we ended up getting over 5,000 brothers and sisters coming in the clean.

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:47.819
Everything was as advertised.

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:56.819
The assistance, the help, the cleaning, all of the capabilities, all of the volunteers were very well prepared and ready to do the job.

00:06:56.819 --> 00:07:02.819
It really is the best way for the Jehovah's Witnesses to present their event and to work directly with the venue to help them do that.

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:05.819
It was really, really, really a great thing for us.

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:08.819
They were happy, they had their buckets, they had their rooms.

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:14.819
Who else can say that they're inviting 30,000 of their friends to come to Detroit and they're coming?

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:15.819
We can do that.

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:19.819
And it's very easy to work with people that are honest, that are concise and candid.

00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:26.819
I've had the opportunity to work super balls and final fours and with a lot of industry professionals, but this group gets it.

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:32.819
And when we ask for something, they deliver and they deliver above and beyond our expectations.

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:41.819
Not at all, hollow promises or anything very much capable and competent to deliver on what they say they're going to do and articulate what support they may need.

00:07:41.819 --> 00:07:45.819
And once those things are agreed to, people do what they say they're going to do.

00:07:45.819 --> 00:07:49.819
The attendees that come in are incredible individuals.

00:07:49.819 --> 00:07:54.819
It really delivers the type of group, the atmosphere that we love to host here in Arlington.

00:07:54.819 --> 00:07:56.819
It's very much of a family atmosphere here.

00:07:56.819 --> 00:08:01.819
You have 30,000 people in there that's these learning, learning and actually listening.

00:08:01.819 --> 00:08:06.819
Nobody's drunk, nobody's walking around, nobody's spilling food, anything.

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:10.819
No, they're actually sitting and listening and learning.

00:08:10.819 --> 00:08:12.819
And they're being polite and kind.

00:08:12.819 --> 00:08:16.819
My police chief told me that this is the best behave group he's ever seen at the stadium.

00:08:16.819 --> 00:08:17.819
And you ought to be very proud.

00:08:18.819 --> 00:08:21.819
Your organization comes in, my whole staff feels good.

00:08:21.819 --> 00:08:22.819
The work with everyone.

00:08:22.819 --> 00:08:24.819
It has been a phenomenal experience.

00:08:24.819 --> 00:08:27.819
All of your attendees are just amazing.

00:08:27.819 --> 00:08:31.819
And it's our job to make you guys feel welcome, but it's interesting.

00:08:31.819 --> 00:08:32.820
We feel welcomed as well.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:33.820
And this is our city.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.820
You have a fantastic group of people.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.820
I mean, we've done tons of conventions and we can't say that about most of them.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.820
The people got here and were just very easy to deal with and very pleasant.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.820
So it was a great, great event for us.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:50.820
We would love the opportunity to host the Jehovah's Witness International Convention every year if we could.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:54.820
You've definitely left the city in a much better place than you found it.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:55.820
And we appreciate that whole heart.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:09:00.820
And I would encourage any city that you talk to, any official that you talk to, to please call me.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:05.820
And I'm happy to expound the virtues of having Jehovah Witnesses come to be your city.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.820
I'm convinced that this is history in the making.
