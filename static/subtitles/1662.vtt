WEBVTT

00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:05.509
I came from a rather large family.

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:08.509
We went to church from our youth on.

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:11.509
I guess I really stopped going to church

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:13.509
when I was a teenager.

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.510
I graduated from high school in 1965.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.510
Since the Vietnam War was raging,

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.510
I knew I would have to make a decision.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.510
I didn't want to fight in Vietnam

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.510
because I didn't want to get killed first of all.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.509
And I didn't really want to be put in a position

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.509
where I might have to kill someone else.

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:38.509
And so I decided that the best thing for me to do

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:41.509
instead of trying to dodge the draft

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:44.509
was to join a form of the military

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:46.509
where I wouldn't have to fight.

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:48.509
I worked on airplanes.

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:50.509
Every night was an adventure.

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:51.509
You know, when you're off base,

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:54.509
you're either downtown with the black market,

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:57.509
the clubs, buying and selling drugs.

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:58.509
It was just a wild scene.

00:00:58.509 --> 00:01:01.509
After my military service was over

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:03.509
and I was utterly discharged,

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:05.510
I went to one of the old clubs

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.510
that everybody used to go to.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.510
And to my surprise,

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.510
one of the guys that I worked with

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.510
and the Air Force was there.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.510
We got to talking.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.510
And right there,

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.510
that very night we devised

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.510
this plan to go to Thailand.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.510
And I got some drugs.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.510
Two months later, that's what we did.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.510
Just to get there,

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.510
we had to go through a channel

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.510
of waterways through the jungle.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.510
When we got to this one little island

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.510
where this drug lord was,

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.510
we picked up the drugs

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.510
and when we got to the airport,

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.510
this Thai colonel

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.510
and the police force,

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.510
he put a 38 right here

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.510
and he told me,

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.510
please do not try to resist me.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.510
So from there, of course,

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.510
we went to a jail,

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.510
a clung-prim prison,

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.510
right there in Thailand.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.510
Life in clung-prim was pretty grim.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.510
And so you only had got fear twice a day.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.509
They wouldn't serve it to us.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.509
They would put it out in the middle of the yard.

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:15.509
And you had to run for it.

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:17.509
Awful.

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:19.509
Two months.

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:21.509
I lost 130 pounds.

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:25.509
And so I had to fight.

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:27.509
It was crazy.

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:31.509
We had this British gentleman

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:33.509
come to visit us

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:35.509
while we were in prison.

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:37.509
And he told us that

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:39.509
he was from the American consulate

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:41.509
and that he wanted to help us.

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:42.509
And he said,

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:43.509
let me tell you something.

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:45.509
You're in a lot of trouble.

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:47.509
So as it turned out,

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:50.509
this man was the chief narcotics agent.

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:53.509
For the whole Southeast Asia area.

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:54.509
And he said,

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:55.509
I want you to work for me

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:57.509
as a special agent.

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:58.509
And so I told him,

00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:00.509
okay, you know, I'll try it.

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:02.509
And then back to Okinawa.

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:04.509
And that's where I started to work

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:07.919
as an agent.

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:09.919
He said, you're not going to get paid.

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:12.919
You know, you're going to have to deal drugs to survive.

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:14.919
And along the way,

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:15.919
I set up drug dealers

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:18.919
who was dealing pretty big.

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:20.919
After a year of that,

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:21.919
and they reviewed my case

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:23.919
and they gave me an opportunity

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:26.919
to either keep working

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:28.919
as one of their special agents

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:30.919
so I got out of the business.

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:32.919
So I chose to get out of the business.

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:34.919
I had decided that I had to change my life.

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:36.919
I was disgusted

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:38.919
with the way I was living.

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:40.919
And so I was sitting in my apartment

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.919
late one afternoon and,

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:44.919
as a little lady, you know,

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:45.919
knocked on the door,

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:46.919
a little Japanese lady.

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:48.919
I went to the door

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:50.919
and I discerned

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.919
that she wasn't trying to hustle me for anything.

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:55.919
And so I invited her in.

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:59.919
And she was talking about God and the Bible.

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:02.919
And she had this little blue book, you know,

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.919
a truth at least to eternal life.

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:07.919
I said, sit to myself, here we go.

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:10.919
That's when everything began to make sense.

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:15.919
What now seems to me to be basic Bible doctrines

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.920
were like bombshells to me.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.920
I mean, I was phenomenal

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.920
the way that one visit

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.920
changed my life that day,

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.920
that very day I knew that

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.920
that was the truth

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.920
and that I had to stick with it.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.920
The very next week,

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.920
she came, took me to the

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.920
Theocratic school and service meeting

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.920
and I've been going every sense.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.920
I realized that I had to

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.920
change my lifestyle completely.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.920
I made rapid changes,

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.920
internal changes.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.920
My whole thinking process has changed.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.920
I was baptized on August 30th, 1974.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.920
They I'll never forget.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.920
The best thing for me to do

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.920
was to return home

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.920
and go to the local congregation there

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.920
where there will be, you know,

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.920
spiritually qualified men to help me

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.920
to continue to grow spiritually.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.920
I really, really wanted to go to Bethel

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.920
and so I determined

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.920
that that's what I was going to do.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.920
And so I made it a goal

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.920
and I stuck with it, you know,

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.920
for five years after I got home.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.920
And finally, I got the privilege.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.920
That privilege

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.920
that was extended to me

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.920
to come into serve at Bethel.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.920
It stretched out to be 35 years

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.920
and I can't believe it.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.920
Since serving here at Bethel,

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.920
I've served in a number of assignments.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.920
Currently, I serve as a desk receptionist,

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.920
caring for building maintenance duties,

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.920
the occupants of the building,

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.920
greeting guests,

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.920
and just generally trying to be

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.920
as helpful as possible.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.920
I mean, I think about

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.920
all the good things that Jehovah has done for me

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.920
and for my wife, Bonnie.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.920
It's been phenomenal.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.920
I've learned that you can't

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.920
really do anything in your own strength.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.920
Jehovah, he searches the heart.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.920
He looks for people who are

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.920
yearning for something better,

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.920
the direction that only he can give.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.920
Sometimes I shudder

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.920
at the course I could have taken

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:41.920
on a number of occasions

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.920
that would have led to

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.920
a different outcome.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.920
And so I'm very happy to be in the truth.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.920
It is absolutely

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.920
the best way of life.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.920
I don't know much,

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.920
but I do know this

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.920
that Jehovah is real.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.920
He's very kind and merciful.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.920
I do know that.
