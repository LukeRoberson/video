00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.459
I invite you to turn please to Proverbs chapter 17.

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:14.500
And as you locate this in your Bible, I invite you also to imagine two runners.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.219
One is rich, the other is poor.

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:27.660
The rich runner has a gymnasium, an Olympic-sized pool, all-the-weight machines, a nutritionist,

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.980
a physical therapist, a doctor, and a personal trainer.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.579
And he has access to the finest foods there are.

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.659
But somewhere along the way, he's grown just a little bored with the whole concept of

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:43.219
foot races.

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.340
And so he hasn't put his heart into training.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.700
Also lined up next to him is the poor runner.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.700
The poor runner also has a few advantages.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.859
He has a good pair of shoes.

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:05.859
He has real food, he eats not much, mostly plants, but he loves the race.

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:07.500
He has a heart for it.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.340
He trains in all kinds of weather.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.900
Now which of the two will win the race?

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.780
The man with the most advantages or the man with the heart?

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:31.140
Now with that illustration in mind, notice what it says in Proverbs 17 and verse 16.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:43.299
What good is it that the stupid one has the means to acquire wisdom when he has no heart

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.060
for acquiring it?

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:55.099
Like winning a race, acquiring wisdom does not happen without effort, without cost, without

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:59.900
sacrifice, hence a person has to have the means.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:07.099
And yet doesn't Jehovah really supply the necessary ingredients for each of us to acquire

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:08.099
wisdom?

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:17.300
It has access to thinking, ability, information, opportunities, evidence in some degree or

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.259
another if he really wants it.

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:29.860
But as Proverbs 17 and 16 asks, what good is that if a person has no heart, no drive,

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.539
no sense?

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:39.780
It's not about the multiplicity of our advantages or the quality of our advantages.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.819
It's about the heart, the total inner person.

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:49.780
Now when it comes to acquiring true wisdom, making sound decisions despite not having much

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.699
data at one's disposal, our publications have often pointed to the example of Joseph.

00:02:56.699 --> 00:03:03.819
Long before Moses recorded Jehovah's Law against adultery, Joseph understood that this

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.020
was a sin against God.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:12.580
Recall his words at Genesis 39 and verse 9, there is no one greater in this house than

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:19.860
I am, and he has not withheld from me anything at all except you because you are his wife.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:28.300
So how could I commit this great badness and actually sin against God, conscience fully

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.300
engaged?

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.139
But the question is, how did Joseph know that?

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:38.780
Follow along in Genesis and consider what may have influenced his thinking.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:48.300
Joseph had one Bible principle and no less than four real life applications of that principle

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.300
to meditate on.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:58.419
The principle, of course, is stated in Genesis 2, verse 24, that is why a man will leave

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:04.979
his father and his mother and he will stick to his wife and they will become one flesh,

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:10.419
the words of Jehovah God himself, earth's first wedding talk.

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:17.860
One man, one wife, one flesh, that's the standard, Joseph meditated on that.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:23.860
And likely he meditated on what happened to his great grandfather Abram in chapter 12

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:30.860
as Abram and Sarai traveled to Egypt, Genesis 1217.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.779
This account tells us that Abram failed to tell Pharaoh that he was married to Sarai.

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:41.860
So when Pharaoh showed special interest in Sarai, Genesis 1217 says that Jehovah struck

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:50.699
Pharaoh and all his household with severe plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife.

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:56.939
Later in chapter 20, Abram and Sarai went to the land of Girar and employed a similar

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:57.939
strategy.

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:04.779
They didn't reveal that they were married and the king of Girar, Abimalech, had this experience

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:11.459
in Genesis 20 and verse 3, afterward God came by night to Abimalech in a dream and said

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:19.019
to him, here you are as good as dead because of the woman whom you have taken since she is

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:23.899
married and belongs to another man.

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:26.339
And Abimalech said to Jehovah, listen, I didn't know.

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:28.819
And Jehovah said, I know you didn't know.

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:40.819
And so he says in verse 6, at the end, I held you back from sinning against me, sinning

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:45.300
against me.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.379
Joseph undoubtedly meditated on that.

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:55.100
Then in Genesis chapter 26 and verse 10, his grandfather Isaac and his grandmother Rebecca

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.339
also went to Girar.

00:05:57.339 --> 00:06:01.819
They also met a man named Abimalech, likely a successor of the Abimalech mentioned in

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:06.180
chapter 20 and they too didn't tell Abimalech that they were married but the king found

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.500
out.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.980
And so in Genesis chapter 26 and verse 10, Abimalech continued, what have you done with

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:12.980
us?

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.139
One of the people could have easily have lain down with your wife and you would have

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:22.660
brought guilt upon us.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.819
And audibly Joseph meditated on that or considered what happened in Genesis chapter 34.

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:35.339
The principal recorded it, Genesis 2.24 again came into play, a man, his wife, one flesh.

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:41.459
Jacob was not yet married to Dina, but he violated her.

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:47.600
And Genesis chapter 34 verse 7 says, something like that ought not to be done.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.139
That was how it was viewed.

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:53.379
So while it's true that Joseph didn't have the mosaic law, young people ask, learned

00:06:53.379 --> 00:07:00.699
from the great teacher, JW Library or JW.org, he had a principal.

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:02.139
He had enough.

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:08.019
He had seen at no fewer than four applications of that principal.

00:07:08.019 --> 00:07:13.540
If only Ruben and Judah had also had such appreciation for that principal.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:18.019
But the point is, Joseph fed his heart with that knowledge and there's also another

00:07:18.019 --> 00:07:23.300
important factor that we can't lose sight of in Genesis chapter 39 and verse 21.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.779
It wasn't just an intellectual exercise for Joseph.

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:36.339
Look at chapter 39 and what it says in verse 21, Jehovah continued with Joseph and kept

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:39.699
showing loyal love to him.

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:48.420
Yes, even before the situation where he was tested with Potiphar's wife, Jehovah had

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.660
been showing loyal love to him.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.500
That's born out in Genesis chapter 39 verse 3.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.540
And afterward he kept showing loyal love.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.220
And to whom does Jehovah show loyal love?

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:01.620
Jehovah shows loyal love to those acting in loyalty toward him.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.819
Doesn't that be speak a relationship?

00:08:03.819 --> 00:08:05.860
Joseph wasn't just interested.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.860
He didn't just love Jehovah's righteous standards.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:14.819
He loved Jehovah as a person and that was the key.

00:08:14.819 --> 00:08:19.339
Turn with me please to Psalm 119, verse 9.

00:08:19.339 --> 00:08:23.860
Joseph had what Proverbs calls the means to acquire wisdom.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.860
He didn't have the libraries, the websites and the broadcasts, but he had enough.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:36.700
Now notice the similarities between Joseph's situation and that described here in Psalm 119.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.659
How can a young man keep his path clean by keeping on guard according to your word with

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:43.700
my whole heart?

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.500
I seek you.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.779
Do not let me stray from your commandments.

00:08:48.779 --> 00:08:56.580
In my heart, I treasure up your saying so that I may not sin against you.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:00.500
A Joseph had what these verses are talking about.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.940
He searched for Jehovah with his whole heart.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:07.539
He treasured up Jehovah's sayings in his heart and that's how he was able to stay true

00:09:07.539 --> 00:09:10.779
to Jehovah the person that he loved.

00:09:10.779 --> 00:09:11.779
Well we can do the same.

00:09:11.779 --> 00:09:16.820
We have so much more data than Joseph had.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:24.460
We have such excellent tools and Jehovah hasn't changed.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:31.659
So the essential question always boils down to this.

00:09:31.659 --> 00:09:33.740
How is my heart?

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:43.379
Am I still seeking Jehovah with my whole heart or are fear, greed, immoral desire or

00:09:43.379 --> 00:09:49.940
the negative emotions depriving from the completeness of my heart?

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:56.700
If our heart is complete, then we can indeed avoid being swept away by the flood of immoral

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:00.860
propaganda spewed out by Satan's system of things.
