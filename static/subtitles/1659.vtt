WEBVTT

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.849
We graduated in June, got married in July, had a child and of him.

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:10.849
Well, it was a happy time.

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:21.800
At one point, two witnesses knocked on my door and they showed me song 8318.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.800
God's name is Java.

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:34.109
They offered a Bible study, but my study only lasted two to three weeks.

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:38.000
We got a car.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We started going to parties, starting to smoke, have drugs, getting drunk.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We did all these things that really tore our marriage apart.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We thought moving away from our town and our old associates would help.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.099
It was worse than ever.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:11.099
Baseball was more important to me than even my wife.

00:01:11.099 --> 00:01:15.099
I had a real problem with headshot.

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:21.099
There were times when I felt like I was smarter than him.

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:26.099
So I felt like I could make a better decision than he could make.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:39.849
In time, Zaina left me for another person and that's what really hurt me.

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:43.849
Zaina had a hard time with drugs and so forth.

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:51.900
That's when I got custody of the kids.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:02:07.540
I decided at that moment I was done and Jehovah popped into my head.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:17.539
I remember getting down and telling Jehovah,

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:21.539
just show me what to do.

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:29.539
I went through the telephone book and looked up Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:37.539
They gave me a book, a family life book.

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:44.169
I showed him that book and I told him,

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:50.169
had we applied this in our marriage from the beginning,

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:55.169
our marriage would have never broke up.

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:59.169
My mind was going really, really,

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:06.960
but I see she was doing things in a spiritual way.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:15.960
She stopped doing drugs and I just saw her mannerism change.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.960
And that short period of time, things got better and better.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.960
And then I started studying the Bible with Zaina.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.960
As when things start, click it.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.960
One of the scriptures that helped me to rebuild our marriage

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.960
is 1 Corinthians 113.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.960
Art is my head.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.960
I am not the head.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.960
Knowing that everybody but Jehovah has a head,

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.960
I view that as a protection.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.960
Now I don't have to make decisions on my own.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:07.069
Galatians chapter 5, verse 22, 23,

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:14.069
that helped me to show love to be a better husband,

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:21.069
a better father, and I always treated like a lady.

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:26.069
Listen to her viewpoints and things like that.

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:32.069
I remarried Arthur on April 2, 1979.

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:38.579
I would tell someone who is struggling in their marriage now,

00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:44.579
apply Bible principles, apply them.

00:04:44.579 --> 00:04:52.579
We learn to be a family with Jehovah.

00:04:52.579 --> 00:04:58.579
And that's why we can deal with the problems that we have to face every day.

00:04:58.579 --> 00:05:05.579
The second time around is so much sweeter with Jehovah in the picture.
