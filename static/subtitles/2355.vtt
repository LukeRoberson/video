00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:17.030
When the Apostle Paul was teaching Jews in the synagogue in Thessalonica, he was accurate

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.350
and convincing.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.309
The count at Acts 17, 2 and 3, says that he reasoned with them from the scriptures, explaining

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:31.789
and proving by references that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.310
the dead.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.509
As a result of Paul's teaching, some of the Jews became Christians.

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:42.990
That will help us to be accurate and convincing when we teach.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:50.189
We must consult reliable sources, use those sources properly, and reason on the evidence

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:52.630
with our audience.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.850
Let's say you're giving a public talk about the last days and you read the following

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:03.189
quote regarding pestilence from the 1996 edition of the Encyclopedia Americana.

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:08.829
It is estimated that more than 100 million cases of malaria occur each year.

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:14.349
In some places, nearly the entire population is infected.

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:18.349
Is the Encyclopedia Americana a reliable source?

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:20.189
Yes.

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.469
Is the source up to date?

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:24.189
No.

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:30.230
When referring to a scientific discovery, a news report, a person's experience, or other

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:38.590
information as evidence, make sure that your sources are trustworthy and up to date.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.390
Additionally, be sure to use sources properly.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.549
Don't overstate or exaggerate facts and figures.

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:53.510
Also, we must apply scriptures in harmony with their context, the Bible's overall message,

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.469
and the publications of the Faithful and Discrete Slave.

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.790
Let's see if you can identify a problem in the following scenario.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.469
After Babylon the Great is destroyed, Jehovah's people will continue to dwell in peace.

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:12.629
What happens next?

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:19.270
In Ezekiel, chapter 38 and 39, we find a thrilling prophecy regarding Gog of the land of

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.990
Megag.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.909
What will Gog of Megag do?

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:29.740
Notice chapter 38 verse 11.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.900
You will say, I will invade the land of unprotected settlements.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.939
I will come against those living in security, without disturbance.

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:47.379
All of them living in settlements unprotected by walls, bars, or gates.

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:57.379
So as we can see, Gog of Megag, which represents Satan the Devil, will attack Jehovah's people.

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:03.099
This in turn will provoke a reaction from the sovereign Lord Jehovah himself.

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.259
What do you think about what this brother said?

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:11.699
Was his explanation of Gog of Megag in harmony with our recent publications?

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:13.500
No.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.780
Let's give him another chance.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.539
I will come against those living in security, without disturbance.

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:26.659
All of them living in settlements unprotected by walls, bars, or gates.

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:35.819
Yes, Gog of Megag, which represents a coalition of nations, will attack Jehovah's people.

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:41.300
This in turn will provoke a reaction from the sovereign Lord Jehovah himself.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:47.340
Now how can we reason with people on the facts so that we're not only accurate, but also

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.699
convincing?

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:53.580
Let's look in on an informal setting.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.659
So based on that, do you think humans evolved over created?

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:58.659
Both.

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:04.539
I think God created simple organisms and then let them evolve.

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:06.419
That doesn't make any sense.

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:09.020
It's either one or the other.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.699
Creation is much more logical.

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:16.300
How far will that conversation go?

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:22.379
We can't force our view on others, but we can reason with them on the evidence.

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:25.339
Let's watch another example.

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:29.699
So based on that, do you think humans evolved or were created?

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:30.699
Both.

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:35.180
I think God created simple organisms and then let them evolve.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.139
That's an interesting view.

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:43.420
When I think about the remarkable complexity of life, I find a Bible verse to be helpful.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.459
It's here at Hebrews chapter 3, verse 4.

00:04:47.459 --> 00:04:54.060
Of course, every house is constructed by someone, but the one who constructed all things

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.660
is God.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.019
We would not assume that something like a phone could come about by chance, right?

00:04:59.019 --> 00:05:00.019
Of course not.

00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:01.420
That wouldn't make sense.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.420
Right.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.459
Complex design is the product of an intelligent mind.

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:13.259
Of course, if your listener poses a question and you don't know the answer, offer to research

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:16.699
the topic and return later.

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:22.220
By using trustworthy evidence to help our listeners arrive at the right conclusions, we may be

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.699
able to help them on to the road to life.
