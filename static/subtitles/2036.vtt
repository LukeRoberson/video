00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:06.259
and introduction to the Book of Numbers.

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:09.259
Numbers was written by Moses.

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:12.259
He began the writing in the wilderness of Sinai

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.260
and completed it on the plains of Moab.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.260
The narrative covers a period of 38 years and nine months,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:27.260
from 1512 to 1473 BCE, when Moses finished the writing.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
Numbers gets its name from the two times

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.259
that Moses numbered the people, first at Mount Sinai,

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:38.259
and later on the plains of Moab.

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:42.259
The book highlights Jehovah's ability to lead his people.

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:47.259
It underscores the need to obey God's appointed representatives,

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:52.259
and it illustrates the importance of strong faith.

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:55.259
Numbers has 36 chapters.

00:00:56.259 --> 00:01:01.259
In chapters 1-4, Israelite males 20 years old and up,

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:05.260
except for the Levites, are registered for the army.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.260
The Levites are set apart to assist the priests.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.260
Chapters 5-9 discuss marital faithfulness, quarantining,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
and service as a Nazarite.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.260
In chapter 10, the Israelites pull away from the wilderness of Sinai

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
by their tribal divisions.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.260
In chapter 11, the people complain about the manna,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.260
a miraculous food provided by Jehovah.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.260
In the next chapter, Miriam and Aaron speak against Moses.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
For this, Miriam is temporarily struck with leprosy

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.260
and quarantined for seven days.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.260
In chapters 13 and 14, 12 Israelite chieftains,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.260
one from each tribe, are sent to spy out the land of Canaan.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
Ten spies bring back a negative report,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
and the people want to return to Egypt.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
For this gross lack of faith,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.260
the Israelites must wander in the wilderness for 40 years

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.889
until that generation has died.

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:14.889
Did you know Joshua and Caleb were the only spies

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:17.889
who had faith in Jehovah.

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:21.889
So they were the only spies who would enter the Promised Land,

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:23.889
and they did.

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:27.889
Caleb inherited the field and settlements of Hebron.

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:31.889
Joshua's inheritance was in the mountainous region of Ephraim,

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:37.319
where he died at the age of 110.

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.319
Chapters 15-17 discuss the various offerings for sins,

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.319
as well as the rebellion and execution of Korah,

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.319
and their supporters.

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.319
In chapter 21, the people again complain about the manor,

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.319
calling it contemptible bread.

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:03.319
In chapters 22-24, Moabite King Balak hires Balam,

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.319
a greedy non-Israelite to curse Israel.

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.319
But Jehovah makes Balam pronounce blessings.

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.319
In chapter 25, many of God's people commit sexual immorality

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.319
with Moabite women.

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.319
This leads to idolatry,

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:27.319
and the death of 24,000 Israelites by a scourge from God.

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.319
In the next chapter, Moses takes the second census.

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.319
In chapter 27, the daughters of Zalofah had tell Moses

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.319
that they have no brother to carry on the family inheritance.

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.319
Jehovah directs that in such situations,

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.319
a daughter may have that privilege.

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.319
Then God commands Moses to ascend a mountain in the region

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.319
of Abraham to view the Promised Land.

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.319
Because Moses is soon to die,

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:03.319
Jehovah tells him to appoint Joshua to lead Israel into Canaan.

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.319
Chapters 31-36 discuss the apportioning of Canaan

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.319
and other matters as the Israelites prepared

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.789
across the Jordan River.

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:16.790
As you read the book of Numbers,

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.790
note how Jehovah patiently guides his people.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.790
See why we need to obey those appointed to take the lead among us,

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.790
and reflect on our need for strong faith

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.790
as we approach a far greater Promised Land,

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.790
the new world under God's Kingdom.
