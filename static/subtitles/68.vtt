WEBVTT

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.740
We extend a warm welcome to all of you.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:13.740
This is the January 2020 edition of JW Broadcasting.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:36.700
Excitement was in the air as brothers and sisters from around the world

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:46.700
poured into the assembly hall in New York for the annual meeting on October 5, 2019.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:53.700
Encouraging reports and thrilling announcements gave clear evidence of Jehovah's

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.700
blessing on the preaching work. Now you will year it for yourself.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:05.700
Please enjoy the first part of the 2019 annual meeting.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:18.159
I've chosen the theme. Your leader is one, the Christ, based on Matthew 23, verse 10.

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:25.500
Starting out with Nimrod of Babylon, the world has seen many leaders, religious leaders,

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.500
political leaders. When Hitler ruled Nazi Germany, Nazis created a slogan,

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:39.500
one people, one empire, one leader. Well, what happened to that leader?

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:47.500
After causing the death of millions during World War II, he reportedly ended his life by suicide.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:55.500
Human leaders have failed. Why? For one, most did not have enough love for God and for the people.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.500
They used their position to acquire wealth, fame, power. Others might have had noble intentions,

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:13.500
but still failed. Why? Imperfect man does not have the ability to rule or lead others perfectly.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.500
In Bible times, Jehovah was the leader of the ancient people of Israel, he said,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:26.500
according to Leviticus 1145, for I am Jehovah who is leading you up out of the land of Egypt

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:33.500
to prove myself God to you. However, Jehovah appointed Moses as visible leader

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.500
representing him, although he was imperfect. Later, he appointed Joshua, then the judges,

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.500
then the kings. However, the people sometimes rejected their leadership.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:56.500
Today, a leader exists whose leadership is perfect, Jesus Christ. He was appointed by Jehovah.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:04.500
We have a leader who is sinless, different from any other human. He is perfect in wisdom and in righteousness.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:12.500
He is more powerful than all human leaders together. He is also perfect in love.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:22.500
He is a leader that gave his life for the people. Do we all appreciate his leadership? I am sure we do.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:29.500
Jesus provided leadership by personal example at the same time showing humility in dealing with others.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.500
He would show love for his disciples throughout the centuries until today, strengthening them when persecuted.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:44.500
He would never abandon them as he also indicated in Matthew 28, 19 and 20.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.500
Do you want to follow his lead? I trust you do.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:58.500
In the first century, at Pentecost 33 CE, the Christian congregation was formed,

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:05.500
but there was a governing body of mature Christians, namely the apostles, who were responsible to take the lead.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:13.500
When some of them were killed or died of sickness or old age, other anointed ones were appointed to serve on that body.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.500
Similarly, today, there is no specific number on the modern day governing body.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:29.500
In the first century, the governing body was not only led by the spirit, but in matters of doctrine, even inspired.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:35.500
Today, it is not inspired, but still led by the spirit.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:46.500
Today, our recognizing Christ's leadership involves submission to and cooperation with his spiritual brothers and with other appointed overseers.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:56.500
After Brother Russell, Brother Rutherford became the president of the society or a human leader at that time.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.500
Whereas at the beginning of his presidency, he strongly emphasized his position.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:10.500
He changed his attitude later, realizing he was not to be considered the number one or the leader.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:19.500
The book, Jehovah's Witnesses Proclaimers of God's Kingdom, says on pages 220 and 21, quote,

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.500
at a conventionist and Louis Missouri in 1941 shortly before his death.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:35.500
He spoke about the matter of leadership, saying, I want to let any strangers here know what you think about a man being you a leader, so they won't forget.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:45.500
If there's any person in this audience who thinks that I, this man standing here, is the leader of Jehovah's Witnesses, say yes.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.500
Where the response was an impressive silence.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:56.500
Broken only by an emphatic no from several in the audience.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:09.500
The speaker continued, if you who are here believe that I am just one of the servants of the Lord and you're working shoulder to shoulder in unity, serving God and serving Christ, say yes.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:17.500
And in unison, the assembly roared out a decisive yes. End of quote.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:26.500
From January 1942 to June 1977, rather Nathan Homer nor served as president of the society.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:38.500
Gradually, by divine influence, authority was shifted more and more from the president to a governing body, as the meaning of the term and the function was understood increasingly better.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:50.500
Today, Jesus is still the leader providing leadership for the congregations. He also directs the worldwide preaching work from heaven.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:07:05.500
However, he has delegated leadership to the faithful and discreet slave, the governing body, through whom he provides spiritual food at the proper time in line with Matthew 24, 45 to 47.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:19.500
No member of the governing body has the title leader, since Jesus said that none of his disciples should be called leader, Matthew 23, 10 to 12.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:27.500
The term governing body was used by us for the first time in the watchtower of 1944, November 1.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:42.500
Page 328 in the article, Theocratic organization in action. But the fact that in 1944 there was no governing body with collective decision making in operation yet.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:55.500
A historic change came on September 6, 1971. It was resolved that the championship of the governing body would rotate annually among its members, doing so alphabetically.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:10.500
On October 1, 1971, Frederick William France became the chairman of the governing body for one year, according to Proclaimers book page 106 and 7.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:18.500
Starting with 1971, the number of the members of the governing body was raised. Gradually, there were 18 members.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:32.500
When the governing body was formed, it was put in writing that all members consider themselves as equals to others. None were more equal than the others.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:47.500
Who was the number one among the 12 apostles? Well, none of them. Revelation 21 and 14 says that in a figurative description, you know, of the New Jerusalem,

00:08:47.500 --> 00:09:01.500
the Messianic Kingdom, that there would be 12 apostles of the Lamb. And no apostle is shown in this text as being superior to another.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:12.500
The governing body also appoints helpers to assist them. This was instituted in 1992.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:26.500
Each of the governing body committees has helpers. They are over 30 helpers now. They participated the meetings of the governing body committee to which they were assigned.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:39.500
They do not share in decision-making, but are offering observations and suggestions, and also they carry out the decisions made by the respective governing body committee.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:51.500
The governing body also appoints branch committees and country committees in different parts of the world, and they take oversight over one or more countries.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:10:06.230
Now, who is the number one on the branch committee? None. Christ is number one. Branch committees also have a chairman that rotates each year alphabetically.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:17.230
This is in place since 1976 already. The chairman of the US branch starting this coming January is Brother Long Schilling.

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:31.230
Who is the leader among congregation elders? Although all of them are to take the lead, none of them is to be considered number one. There is no rotation in place.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:51.230
In a sense, we could say that Jesus is number one or the leader. He is the head of the congregation. The coordinators of the body of elders do not rotate, but they are aware that all elders are equals. None are more equals than the others.

00:10:51.230 --> 00:11:08.230
Well, is Christ's leadership real to you? Well, we are not following a man. Be determined to study more about our leader, imitating him in our personal lives.

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:29.100
Jehovah will love you if you follow his appointed leader now. And if you do, you may get the privilege to follow him forever after into all eternity.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:51.580
We now have the privilege to hear from Brother Steve Lett of the governing body. He will address the subject of our relief ministry used by Jehovah to provide relief.

00:11:51.580 --> 00:12:18.580
Jehovah is a wonderful God of comfort and relief. In stark contrast, Satan the devil is a horrible God of pain and suffering. In fact, if we think about it, even the so-called natural disasters that cause a lot of pain and suffering, Satan is the ultimate cause. Why can we say that?

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:29.580
Well, by alienating humans from Jehovah, Satan deprived them of the creator lovingly controlling the weather for their benefit.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:46.580
Additionally, humans under Satan's rule have grossly mismanaged the earth and its environmental provisions resulting in erratic weather swings which undoubtedly contributes to the so-called natural disasters.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:13:07.580
But how thankful, as we said, Jehovah is a God of comfort and relief. And one way he lives up to this title is by empowering and motivating us to share in a relief ministry in behalf of our brothers who have been pummeled by some catastrophe.

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:14.580
And when we allow Jehovah to use this in this way, we're actually imitating our first century brothers and sisters.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:30.580
Please go to Acts chapter 11, verse 29, the setting is about the year 46 CE. Our brothers in Judea are suffering from a terrible famine.

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:38.580
Being unable to pay the sky high prices for food, they're very hungry. They're even facing starvation.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:47.580
So what did their brothers in Antioch, their Jewish and Gentile brothers do for these brothers in Judea?

00:13:47.580 --> 00:14:00.580
Well, let's read beginning of verse 29, so the disciples determined each according to what he could afford to send relief to the brothers living in Judea.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:06.580
And this they did sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:15.580
Now you can just imagine how appreciative those brothers facing starvation in Judea were to receive this aid from their brothers in Antioch.

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:23.580
And you can just imagine how appreciative Jehovah was for what the ones in Antioch did for their very needy brothers.

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:36.580
And this Bible account is just one of several about our brothers in one area performing a relief ministry in behalf of others living elsewhere who are very needy.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:47.580
Now we ask this, how specifically does Jehovah provide comfort and relief by means of our relief ministry? Well here are three ways.

00:14:47.580 --> 00:15:01.580
One, physical relief is given. See, our brothers immediate needs regarding food, clothing, shelter, medicine, first aid supplies are provided to emotional relief is given.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:10.580
See, assurance is given that they're not alone. Jehovah is with them and their brothers are with them in this time of distress.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:26.580
But most importantly, spiritual relief is given. We make sure that our brothers have what they need to resume immediately their spiritual routine observing Jehovah.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:35.580
But now in order to continue their spiritual routine long term, their lives and their circumstances have to be stabilized.

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:46.580
This often requires either repairing or rebuilding their kingdoms, repairing or even many cases rebuilding their homesy.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:50.580
And then they can continue in this spiritual routine.

00:15:50.580 --> 00:16:06.580
In fact, enjoy please this video showing how our brothers in Indonesia were helped to resume quickly their spiritual routine after the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2018.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:18.620
Four days after the earthquake, evacuation of 132 people began.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:25.620
On Thursday morning, the day after the evacuation, four of us from the branch arrived in Posa.

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:33.620
We combined the meeting of Posa and Barlo congregations was held and our talk was delivered by a member of the branch committee.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:42.620
It was important to check out of the spiritual needs of the brothers and sisters. And amazingly, not a single meeting was missed.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:47.620
And several of us from the branch office give encouraging talks to the publishers there.

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:54.620
Meeting for field service were also held and the publishers. They went out preaching just a couple of days after they had arrived.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:17:03.620
We had the opportunity to go out preaching in Poso. Many people were interested in discussing the events that took place in Barlo.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:07.619
They listened to the Bible's message and asked to be visited again.

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:19.480
After meeting for field service at the Poso Kingdom Hall, we had the opportunity to play sign language videos from GW.org to several deaf ones.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:26.480
Even though we were struck by natural disaster, we were still able to carry out spiritual routines.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:40.480
I am very grateful to Jehovah, the brothers from the branch office and others whose prayers, examples and presents will help us to endure and keep on relying on Jehovah no matter what.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:55.619
By means of our relief ministry, we prove we are imitators of the God of comfort and relief.

00:17:55.619 --> 00:18:09.619
And we also prove that we are obeying the commanded Ephesians 5.1 and 2, which says become imitators of God as beloved children and go on walking in love.

00:18:09.619 --> 00:18:16.619
Now if you think about it, we are really created to imitate Jehovah. We are made in his image, aren't we?

00:18:16.619 --> 00:18:23.619
In contrast, animals cannot imitate Jehovah, the God of unselfish love and comfort and relief.

00:18:23.619 --> 00:18:32.619
For example, you can't imagine a dog thinking to himself, you know, I really feel bad about taking that bone away from the other dog.

00:18:32.619 --> 00:18:37.619
In the future, I'm really going to try to be more unselfish.

00:18:38.619 --> 00:18:43.619
You can't imagine a horse looking up at a beautiful sunset.

00:18:43.619 --> 00:18:51.619
My, that sunset makes me love my creator more. I'm going to try to please him more in the future.

00:18:51.619 --> 00:19:00.619
You can't imagine an eagle praying. Lord, thank you very much for the fish I'm about to eat.

00:19:01.619 --> 00:19:10.619
No animals are not made in God's image, we are. We can imitate our wonderful God of comfort and relief and of love.

00:19:10.619 --> 00:19:18.619
But here's a question, how does our relief ministry glorify Jehovah? Well, here are three ways we'll discuss.

00:19:18.619 --> 00:19:25.619
Number one, it proves that we are true Christians. And that reflects well on our God.

00:19:25.619 --> 00:19:33.619
Secondly, it unites us as brothers and sisters. It unites us in love and prayer.

00:19:33.619 --> 00:19:37.619
As soon as we hear about a disaster affecting our brothers, what do we do?

00:19:37.619 --> 00:19:44.619
We start praying for them, don't we? And then as we start giving them relief, they start praying for us.

00:19:44.619 --> 00:19:50.619
And they start working in harmony with us. That's the second way we're united in activity.

00:19:50.619 --> 00:19:57.619
We bring in the action to help our brothers and they do what they can to support our efforts in their behalf.

00:19:57.619 --> 00:20:04.619
In fact, please enjoy this video, relief workers from the United States, Indonesia and Africa,

00:20:04.619 --> 00:20:08.619
springing into action to help their brothers.

00:20:08.619 --> 00:20:26.599
We are so happy to be able to come and help rebuild the damaged houses so that the brothers feel secure living in them.

00:20:27.599 --> 00:20:32.599
We see this as evidence that we have brotherly love toward one another.

00:20:32.599 --> 00:20:42.910
It's been a faith-strengthening event, not just for the families affected directly by the fire, but for all of us helping out.

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:48.910
We've had the privilege to watch Jehovah do so much for his people.

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:56.910
Physically, emotionally, spiritually, mentally, it's very faith-strengthening to know that Jehovah never abandons us.

00:21:03.099 --> 00:21:08.099
Right after the cyclone hit here in Barrow, we were privileged to be able to come up here and help out.

00:21:08.099 --> 00:21:15.099
It felt really good to be there, to be able to help the brothers to face an extremely difficult situation.

00:21:15.099 --> 00:21:24.099
I learned a lot during this time, always, always, always, follow Jehovah's direction. This is good for us.

00:21:24.099 --> 00:21:28.099
We're actually putting a roof back on their kingdom while it was completely destroyed during the storm.

00:21:28.099 --> 00:21:35.099
And the idea is the memorials next week, they're going to be able to come back to their kingdom hall, which will be fixed up and celebrate the memorial.

00:21:35.099 --> 00:21:47.880
So we're happy to be a part of that.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:52.880
Additionally, we're united in giving contributions.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:57.880
See, we give generously as cheerful givers.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:06.880
And those who have been helped, what do they do? Subsequently, they in turn help others who are afflicted with their contributions.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:17.880
In fact, here are some statistics about the great magnitude of our relief ministry just during the past two service years.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:27.880
Now, during these two service years alone, more than 900,000 of our brothers have been affected, almost a million.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:36.880
62,000 of them being displaced, 190 injured, sadly, 64 were killed.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:44.880
More than 700 kingdom halls were damaged or destroyed. More than 15,000 homes damaged are destroyed.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:54.880
The organization spent $49.5 million on relief efforts just during these two service years.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:58.880
I mean, that's almost $50 million, just two service years.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:06.880
Obviously, our relief ministry has taken on gigantic proportions.

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:20.880
To help you appreciate how your donations are being used, please enjoy this video showing before and after pictures of homes of our brothers after Cyclone EDI struck in Africa.

00:24:17.019 --> 00:24:37.019
Just for your information, those homes that were rebuilt, that you saw there, some were rebuilt, some were repaired, the cost to repair range from $50 to $900 per home, the cost to rebuild was from $900 to $3,500 for each home.

00:24:37.019 --> 00:24:51.019
As you saw, the rebuilt homes are not extravagant, but the brothers often ended up with something a lot better than what they had before because of the use of improved building materials.

00:24:51.019 --> 00:24:56.019
And undoubtedly, this will help them better weather future storms.

00:24:56.019 --> 00:25:11.019
But at this point, we'd like to just take a moment and thank you, dear brothers, commend you for your generous, generous contributions, which make our relief ministry possible.

00:25:11.019 --> 00:25:14.019
You can be sure Jehovah is well pleased.

00:25:14.019 --> 00:25:28.019
In fact, in Hebrews chapter 13 and verse number 16 were told, moreover, do not forget to do good and to share what you have with others.

00:25:28.019 --> 00:25:34.019
For God is well pleased with such sacrifices.

00:25:34.019 --> 00:25:48.019
And I love that thought, not just pleased, he's well pleased with your generosity. So thank you very much. And the governing body, thanks you from the bottom of our hearts, our brothers and sisters who have been helped.

00:25:48.019 --> 00:26:00.019
They thank you from the bottom of their hearts. In fact, enjoy this video and you're going to see some of the brothers in the United States and Africa expressing their appreciation.

00:26:00.019 --> 00:26:22.630
Jehovah has really helped us out in this disaster. Using the brotherhood to strengthen and encourage us in ways we've never seen before. And it's really drawn us closer to him.

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:32.630
Jehovah, through his organization, gave me two wonderful people that were there to take care of my needs, my wants.

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:41.630
Everything I needed was handled through them, just having someone that you can talk to, just having people that care.

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:53.630
I've been in the truth almost 50 years and I've always had friends and it's always been loving and good but I have never felt as loved by Jehovah.

00:26:53.630 --> 00:27:01.630
The service department called and warned that a big storm would arrive one Thursday.

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:11.630
We saw the true love that the branch office had for us and we followed their example. We risked our lives to inform the brothers to come to the Kingdom Hall.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:27.630
The brothers from the branch were constantly in contact with us. I found that really encouraging until very late in the evening they were sending us messages, telling us that they are still up praying for us. Those messages were a great comfort to us.

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:42.289
The organization has been helping us so much emotionally. The branch sent representatives to provide shepherding and also a variety of food, good nutritious food.

00:27:42.289 --> 00:27:50.289
All of this has really been impressive and we want to thank Jehovah for the way he's been caring for us.

00:27:50.289 --> 00:27:58.289
What Jehovah's organization is doing right now is far superior to anything the human governments have been doing.

00:27:58.289 --> 00:28:17.569
We really want to say thank you. We really feel Jehovah's love.

00:28:17.569 --> 00:28:29.569
Seeing that video motivates us even more so to want to help our brothers by means of our donations but also by means of our labor.

00:28:29.569 --> 00:28:44.569
Speaking of labor, we're happy to inform you that later in our program Brother Loosh will tell you about a new provision for applying to help with relief work and other needs in the organization.

00:28:44.569 --> 00:28:50.569
Stay tuned for that revealing of that information.

00:28:51.569 --> 00:29:06.569
Now one more way, a third way, our relief ministry gives a good witness and glorifies Jehovah is that it gives a good witness to onlookers and that glorifies Jehovah.

00:29:06.569 --> 00:29:19.569
Neighbors, family members, government officials see our love in action as a result some actually come into the truth.

00:29:19.569 --> 00:29:27.569
Please enjoy this video, an unbelieving husband coming into the truth as a result of our relief ministry.

00:29:32.599 --> 00:29:39.599
I always loved my family. I wanted the best for them, so I worked to provide for them. That's my duty.

00:29:39.599 --> 00:29:56.759
My wife got baptized two years before me. I built our home right here, then one day our lives changed forever. This is my house, so I have to start again.

00:29:56.759 --> 00:30:05.759
Two brothers came to see me. They said, don't worry about a thing. Everything will be alright. The brothers will take care of it.

00:30:05.759 --> 00:30:11.549
I thought, hmm, I don't know if he knows what he's talking about.

00:30:11.549 --> 00:30:18.549
When the brothers started showing up at my place to help, I was thinking, why would they help me? They don't know me.

00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:25.549
Every morning I watched the brothers, when they finished praying, everyone grabbed their tools and got to work.

00:30:25.549 --> 00:30:30.549
I told my wife that this, this is unbelievable.

00:30:30.549 --> 00:30:40.549
When I saw an elderly sister carrying concrete blocks, they were so heavy for them. I ran inside with tears in my eyes. I didn't want anyone to see me cry.

00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:47.789
I thought, something is wrong with them for sure, or something is wrong with me.

00:30:47.789 --> 00:30:53.710
I began to appreciate what they did and how they acted.

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:57.710
A lot of love. That's the only way I can put it. A lot of love.

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:06.470
They even shared their food with me. They made it clear that this work was a sign of Jehovah's love.

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:15.470
And all those things touched my heart. They let me know that, man, this organization is for real and it's the truth.

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:27.470
I wanted to be part of that. I decided to give my life to Jehovah because he showed me how much he loves both me and my family.

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:31.470
Now I take care of my family better than ever before.

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:53.900
So in review, our relief ministry is a loving expression from the God of comfort and relief whom we serve.

00:31:53.900 --> 00:32:00.900
By means of it, Jehovah uses us to provide physical, emotional and spiritual relief to our brothers.

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:14.900
And it glorifies Jehovah by one, identifying us as true Christians, too, by uniting us as brothers and sisters in love, prayer, action, and giving contributions.

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:22.900
And it glorifies Jehovah number three by attracting honest-hearted ones to the truth.

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:29.900
How happy we are that soon, Jehovah will provide permanent relief.

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:41.900
There will be no more disasters. But until that grand time, we will continue to exert ourselves in our relief ministry in behalf of our brothers.

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:57.900
Doing so will help us remain focused on spiritual things. It will unite us as brothers and sisters and it will give a unique witness to onlookers and it will help prepare us for the great tribulation

00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:02.900
and the great reconstruction to follow.

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:22.799
Thank you, Brother Lett. It's a relief to know that the Brotherhood provides relief in times of disaster, isn't it?

00:33:22.799 --> 00:33:34.799
We now have a video we invite you to enjoy. It is entitled, The Good Hand of Our God is upon us. Let us get up and build.

00:33:34.799 --> 00:33:57.450
Jehovah's organization now cares for almost 80,000 buildings worldwide, with a total area of more than 215 million square feet or 20 million square meters.

00:33:57.450 --> 00:34:07.450
That is the area of about 2,800 soccer fields or six times the area of Central Park in Manhattan.

00:34:08.449 --> 00:34:21.449
The scores of branch office buildings, hundreds of assembly halls and tens of thousands of kingdom halls around the world provide tangible proof that God's kingdom is ruling.

00:34:21.449 --> 00:34:24.449
Why can we say that?

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:32.449
As Psalm 1271 reminds us, none of this would be possible without Jehovah's blessing.

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:44.449
Like Nehemiah and the Jews who rebuilt Jerusalem's walls, we are confident that the Good Hand of Our God is upon us.

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:54.449
These buildings have been dedicated to Jehovah, so it is a privilege for us to make sure they continue to measure up to the purpose for which they were built.

00:34:54.449 --> 00:35:06.449
Our branch facilities are especially well maintained. Some of these properties are relatively new, but many others are 30 or more years old.

00:35:06.449 --> 00:35:23.449
A building itself may last 30, 60 or even 100 years, but building systems may reach the end of their life after only 15 or 20 years, so many of our facilities are need of major renovation or replacement.

00:35:23.449 --> 00:35:31.449
Activities at Bethel are also changing, so interior layouts sometimes need to be updated.

00:35:31.449 --> 00:35:41.449
All of this presents a challenge. How do we take care of our Bethel facilities and still keep up with the work on our kingdom halls?

00:35:41.449 --> 00:35:47.449
Indeed, what is the need? How can we address it? And how can you help?

00:35:47.449 --> 00:35:52.449
Join us now on an encouraging trip around the world.

00:35:53.449 --> 00:36:07.710
We want to show you what's being done and plan for our branch facilities. Fasten your seat belts, please. This report will be moving quickly.

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:20.710
Our brains are not good at noticing gradual change. For this reason, the organization began a program a few years ago to evaluate the current and future needs of our properties every two to three years.

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:28.710
And based on this assessment, a decision can be made for each property on whether or not to renovate and what that should involve.

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:42.230
At times, it makes more sense to renovate or redevelop what we already have. Major renovations have already started in branches that need it the most.

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:54.230
The government body would like to see more of the Bethelites care for their own personal services. The offices always used to be individual for one person.

00:36:54.230 --> 00:37:09.039
Now, it's better if the office is open and use dividers because these can be easily changed, modified according to the necessity of the work.

00:37:09.039 --> 00:37:19.039
Well, Patterson is a beautiful and practical complex. I don't think anyone envisioned when the complex was built that we would have over a thousand of our brothers and sisters visiting Bethel every day.

00:37:19.039 --> 00:37:29.039
But having a visitor center is going to give them an improved tour experience here at Patterson and at the same time make sure that departments are able to do their work.

00:37:29.039 --> 00:37:43.920
In 2013, the government body decided to merge the Finland branch with several other branches.

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:53.920
Additionally, the oldest parts of the facility were almost 60 years old. We had been printing literature in Finland for 83 years.

00:37:53.920 --> 00:38:07.920
But now, under the guidance of the government body was decided that we will stop printing in Finland and use the space of the old printer for new offices and other purposes.

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:13.920
We were a little concerned where would we find all the needed volunteers.

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:21.920
When we told about our needs to local congregations, the applications started to flow in.

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:34.329
We realized that here we have all fine young brothers and sisters. It has been really touching to see their willing spirit.

00:38:34.329 --> 00:38:43.329
Sometimes it's not practical to renovate a property, so we would purchase or build new buildings and then sell the old ones.

00:38:43.329 --> 00:38:54.670
This was recently decided, for example, in Argentina, Cameroon and India.

00:38:54.670 --> 00:39:00.670
Our Bethel family decreased from around 350 to 160.

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:08.670
The multiple buildings were spread across several properties and with the reduction, many of them were no longer being used.

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:16.670
It was decided that our Bethel facilities resolved and to begin a search for a new Bethel facility.

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:26.670
The timing had to be precise between the purchase and construction of a new facility and the sale of all current properties.

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:37.670
We saw Jehovah's direction clearly. On the one hand, we had the sale of all the properties and on the other hand, the purchase of the new process.

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:42.670
Both processes climaxed within the same 24-hour period.

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:54.659
The kingdom preaching work has sped up in our branch territory. We've experienced a 4% increase in Cameroon like we've never experienced before.

00:39:54.659 --> 00:40:01.659
We're now translating into 29 different languages. We did consider renovating our present location.

00:40:01.659 --> 00:40:07.659
But how do you continue the work in a tiny branch while a renovation is happening around you?

00:40:07.659 --> 00:40:14.659
We had a piece of land right next to one of our major assembly halls in one of the biggest cities in our branch territory.

00:40:14.659 --> 00:40:23.659
But sadly, the access was terrible. A dirty muddy road, very difficult to access either in car or on foot.

00:40:23.659 --> 00:40:33.659
All of a sudden something amazing happens. The local government decides to build a road ranked outside our assembly hall, thus giving us access to this piece of land.

00:40:33.659 --> 00:40:38.659
It was Jehovah saying this is the piece of land where you should build a new Cameroon rush.

00:40:38.659 --> 00:40:54.599
Our facility was now oversized for our real needs. The governing body directed that we sell this property, relocate the branch to a more economical facility.

00:40:54.599 --> 00:40:59.599
We realized that we were millions of dollars short of the needed funds.

00:40:59.599 --> 00:41:09.599
We needed a buyer who would agree to buy the facility at the right price, give us enough money in advance to pay for the new branch,

00:41:09.599 --> 00:41:16.599
and allow us to keep using the existing branch till the new one is ready. We felt very helpless.

00:41:16.599 --> 00:41:31.070
It was a few days before we were scheduled to sign up for the new branch, a buyer who'd shown interest, but had not yet committed anything, signed a binding agreement and met all our conditions.

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:38.070
He also provided a large amount of non-refundable deposit to help us to purchase the new branch.

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:45.070
Nothing is impossible for Jehovah. He timed everything perfectly.

00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:57.070
Many more projects like these are in the planning stage. We want all of our properties to keep meeting the organization's needs and reflecting well on Jehovah.

00:41:57.070 --> 00:42:04.070
Besides renovations, many of our branch facilities are again being used to capacity.

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:13.539
The number of publishers, commuters, remote volunteers and Bethelites has increased worldwide.

00:42:13.539 --> 00:42:20.539
Some countries have seen an increase of 5, 7 or more percent in the number of publishers each year.

00:42:20.539 --> 00:42:30.539
More work is also being done worldwide in translation, video production, digital publishing, and other important areas.

00:42:30.539 --> 00:42:41.539
The organization pursues every avenue to make our Bethel operations more efficient, but we will always need people to do much of the work.

00:42:41.539 --> 00:42:47.539
Therefore, planning has already begun to see where additional expansion might be needed.

00:42:47.539 --> 00:42:56.539
We have many World Headquarters departments involved in the planning process to get input, also the branch committee is involved in this.

00:42:56.539 --> 00:43:09.539
Before any facility is recommended for expansion, questions are asked. For example, is this expansion going to directly advance the preaching and teaching activity in the country?

00:43:09.539 --> 00:43:24.539
Could it be that with some operational changes the function of the branch could be discontinued in some way or outsourced or simplified in some way to mean that we wouldn't need to expand?

00:43:24.539 --> 00:43:38.539
With recent changes in Bethel operations, it is possible for us now to buy standard apartments and offices for a Bethel facility, if we need more offices and apartments we buy them from the market.

00:43:38.539 --> 00:43:47.539
And as these options are investigated, we look for Jehovah's Hand in this, what is evidence that his spirit is behind one of these options?

00:43:47.539 --> 00:44:01.539
The governing body has asked all of us to give priority to those activities that contribute the most to the spiritual welfare of God's people and the advancement of the global preaching work.

00:44:01.539 --> 00:44:07.539
This principle helps us to prioritize our efforts worldwide.

00:44:07.539 --> 00:44:18.039
There is definitely a lot to do, but it is really exciting to see the good hand of Jehovah on his people today.

00:44:18.039 --> 00:44:29.039
The brothers and sisters everywhere are zealously supporting this work with their time, financial resources and prayers.

00:44:29.039 --> 00:44:38.179
We are confident that Jehovah God will continue to bless the collective efforts to provide the facilities the organization needs.

00:44:38.179 --> 00:44:48.690
And the skills we are learning do not only benefit us now, but into the future, right into God's new world.

00:44:48.690 --> 00:45:05.670
Thank you brothers for bringing us up to date on what is happening with our Bethel facilities around the world.

00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:13.670
When Nehemiah prepared to rebuild Jerusalem's walls, he took a prayerful and practical approach.

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:21.670
Jehovah blessed that approach because Nehemiah acted in faith and relied fully on Jehovah.

00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:29.670
When the people saw that Jehovah's good hand was on Nehemiah, they said, let us get up and build.

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:35.670
Well the governing body today makes facility decisions in a similar way.

00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:50.670
They prayerfully analyze what is needed, they make sure we have the necessary resources to finish the work, and then they present to God's people what they have in mind to do and ask for their support.

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:54.670
So what is left for us to say?

00:45:54.670 --> 00:46:01.670
Thank you for your loyal support in the days ahead of all these important initiatives.

00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:06.670
Jehovah will bless you too for your willing and generous spirit.

00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:21.739
And now it's time for us to get up and build.

00:46:21.739 --> 00:46:26.739
Maintenance, renovation and new construction are ongoing projects.

00:46:26.739 --> 00:46:32.739
But how does the governing body decide when and where to build new facilities?

00:46:32.739 --> 00:46:42.739
We searched our archived video files and found some comments from some brothers who were involved in property acquisition in years past.

00:46:42.739 --> 00:46:49.739
These comments predate the more recent decision to move World Headquarters out of Brooklyn, New York.

00:46:49.739 --> 00:46:58.739
Please enjoy this faith strengthening video entitled A Historic Look at Property Acquisition.

00:46:58.739 --> 00:47:11.539
Back in 1926 the Rutherford wanted to have a block for 30 Columbia Heights.

00:47:11.539 --> 00:47:18.539
And he tried to buy it and they kept it in problems and obstacles. So finally told him to get something else.

00:47:18.539 --> 00:47:28.539
1927, Squibbottom, and in that block they had to sink over 1,600 pilings, eight inch cylinders,

00:47:28.539 --> 00:47:32.539
some as much as 90 feet to get solid terrain and fill all those of concrete.

00:47:32.539 --> 00:47:42.539
It's a tremendous expense. Had the society got a purpose to build there, they may not have had the money to do the two jobs, the footings and the building.

00:47:42.539 --> 00:47:52.039
So there was a case where Jehovah blocked it because of that and finally we got 117 out of this.

00:47:52.039 --> 00:47:57.039
Well, I was down in North Carolina at the paper mill that makes all of our Bible paper.

00:47:57.039 --> 00:48:02.039
And I happened to mention too, we're trying to expand in Brooklyn with discount fine property.

00:48:02.039 --> 00:48:05.039
And the president said, would you be interested in Squibbottom?

00:48:05.039 --> 00:48:10.039
I said, we sure would, we don't think that's available. He said I can tie you in on that if you're interested.

00:48:10.039 --> 00:48:15.039
So he got a hole in the settle up for three million cash.

00:48:15.039 --> 00:48:19.039
We never expect to get it for that. There's ten buildings on the phone.

00:48:19.039 --> 00:48:22.039
This case just shows your whole direction matters.

00:48:22.039 --> 00:48:36.150
Well, originally the reason we bought the what-star farm, the family was growing here in Brooklyn.

00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:40.150
And mountain farm was limited because it was only a hundred and some acres.

00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:45.150
So Broughtonore approved this buying a piece of land.

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:49.150
But it was as the Georgia got one place in mind, Goble's Farm.

00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:54.150
Georgia is the same place I want to look at. So we went up there without a Friday.

00:48:54.150 --> 00:49:04.150
The brother there said to both Georgian Max, well you know we just had a family business meeting just a few days ago.

00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:08.150
And we want to sell our property, our farm.

00:49:10.619 --> 00:49:16.619
And the interesting thing is, Broughtonore said this is only going to be for a farm.

00:49:16.619 --> 00:49:23.619
Don't get any ideas of anything else. It's for a farm.

00:49:23.619 --> 00:49:30.619
Well back in 1960 when we bought that much land, we had no idea of a printer rep.

00:49:30.619 --> 00:49:36.619
But what did the Lord have in mind for it? He had in mind to put the printer there.

00:49:36.619 --> 00:49:43.619
We were zealously going after a farm, but we didn't need string beans and potatoes.

00:49:43.619 --> 00:49:50.619
We needed books and bibles printed up there. And so we see the good results of it today.

00:49:50.619 --> 00:50:03.619
What a difference. Who could ever think that watchtower farms could turn into being the United States branch of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:50:03.619 --> 00:50:10.619
That to me is a wonderful example of Jehovah leading the organization.

00:50:10.619 --> 00:50:21.119
So we started in 1980 looking for suitable property out of the city for expansion.

00:50:21.119 --> 00:50:26.119
One time we looked at the piece of property over in Jersey it was an old school.

00:50:26.119 --> 00:50:30.119
The buildings were so bad we never got them fixed up.

00:50:30.119 --> 00:50:35.119
And so we told the real estate man know we really don't want them.

00:50:35.119 --> 00:50:42.119
I know he's looking anymore. Well he got a little upset and he said, well what do you want?

00:50:42.119 --> 00:50:59.119
And I said what we really want is something up near Soffron or Brewster, about five, six hundred acres of land where there's roads and hills and scenery and water and all that.

00:50:59.119 --> 00:51:03.119
And I'm thinking he'd never find them because we looked all over the country.

00:51:03.119 --> 00:51:10.119
Well the next day about 11 o'clock he called me and he said I found your property.

00:51:10.119 --> 00:51:16.119
I took it up with the governing body and we looked at the property and I loved it.

00:51:16.119 --> 00:51:21.119
We told the town we wanted four or five hundred people.

00:51:21.119 --> 00:51:27.119
Well before we got our final permit to build we had it up to 1,500.

00:51:27.119 --> 00:51:34.119
And we're looking to adjust here and there to accommodate what we need there now.

00:51:34.119 --> 00:51:39.119
Patterson has cooperated very well with us and it let us build anything we wanted to build.

00:51:39.119 --> 00:51:41.119
And it's quite extensive.

00:51:41.119 --> 00:51:45.119
The even the point now that they're made known if you want to expand you can still expand.

00:51:45.119 --> 00:51:48.119
So we got a good relationship with Patterson.

00:51:48.119 --> 00:51:53.119
How these projects have met the organization's need is amazing.

00:51:53.119 --> 00:51:58.119
And at the proper time every one of these no matter what.

00:51:58.119 --> 00:52:05.119
Today we have millions in the truth and the Bible tells us that we're going to grow and fill the earth.

00:52:05.119 --> 00:52:10.119
How many millions of people will have in the truth when Armageddon comes?

00:52:10.119 --> 00:52:14.119
We don't know. We don't know when Armageddon's coming.

00:52:14.119 --> 00:52:19.119
We're not going backwards. We're going to continue going ahead.

00:52:19.119 --> 00:52:25.119
Doing things more efficient or it means you're going to have to expand. You're going to have to build.

00:52:25.119 --> 00:52:28.119
So you have to always be looking ahead.

00:52:28.119 --> 00:52:33.119
Right to the end we're going to be giving us spiritual food at the right time.

00:52:33.119 --> 00:52:39.119
We don't know what the Lord's going to use after the Great Tribulation immediately.

00:52:39.119 --> 00:52:44.119
As Brother Couch said and Brother Larson felt the same way.

00:52:44.119 --> 00:52:49.119
The Lord is running the organization. So we got to follow him.

00:52:49.119 --> 00:53:01.530
And whatever he tells us we do it.

00:53:01.530 --> 00:53:08.530
It's so interesting to see Jehovah's direction in locating useful properties.

00:53:08.530 --> 00:53:17.530
And that brings us to a related subject. The title of the next video is a new construction project is being planned.

00:53:17.530 --> 00:53:21.530
Please watch and enjoy the following presentation.

00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:35.210
We live in a time when technology has allowed us to communicate the truth of God's Word in new and exciting ways.

00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:45.210
Our modern world has seen advancements in printing, radio, television, computers and of course the Internet.

00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:54.210
You likely can remember a time just a few short years ago when we released only a handful of videos every year.

00:53:54.210 --> 00:54:04.210
But these now number into the hundreds with videos created for use in the ministry, midweek meetings,

00:54:04.210 --> 00:54:10.210
GW broadcast programming, regional conventions.

00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:16.210
And we can't forget the become Jehovah's Friend series.

00:54:16.210 --> 00:54:24.699
Jehovah's organization has made use of videos over the years, over the decades.

00:54:24.699 --> 00:54:30.699
But from 2014 forward we have seen a dramatic increase in the use of videos.

00:54:30.699 --> 00:54:35.699
And that has really impacted how we teach and how we reach hearts.

00:54:35.699 --> 00:54:39.699
Because of the demand for more videos, more space was needed.

00:54:39.699 --> 00:54:42.699
So we purchased the Mount Ebo property.

00:54:42.699 --> 00:54:46.699
And there we have been making many of our large video productions.

00:54:46.699 --> 00:54:52.360
Well the response from the brothers and sisters in the field has been outstanding.

00:54:52.360 --> 00:55:05.360
It's been amazing. It's actually been very encouraging for the teaching committee and the governing body to see how the brothers and sisters appreciate the videos, the music and the recordings that are produced.

00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:11.360
It's helping them to really understand the teaching points and God's word.

00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:15.360
It helps them to deal with the anxieties and pressures of life.

00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:24.360
It really helps them to appreciate too what's happening around the world when they hear reports, dramatizations and interviews.

00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:29.360
With this explosive growth and even more coming on the horizon.

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:38.360
The governing body has determined it's Jehovah's direction that we take further steps to support this expanded use of video.

00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:45.360
So we are thrilled to announce an exciting initiative currently underway to accomplish this.

00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:56.360
The creation of a site dedicated primarily to media production, the building of a new facility in Ramapo, New York.

00:55:56.360 --> 00:56:16.349
Yes, the governing body has a proof construction of an additional World Headquarters complex on a 248 acre property purchased in 2009.

00:56:16.349 --> 00:56:23.349
The property is located two miles or about three kilometers from the existing World Headquarters facility in Warwick.

00:56:23.349 --> 00:56:35.730
Our objective is to build a facility similar in size to Warwick, which would include ten residence buildings, a main office building.

00:56:35.730 --> 00:56:47.730
Eight studio spaces for audio video productions, a multi-purpose space including kitchen, dining and meeting area, plus a visitor center.

00:56:47.730 --> 00:57:01.730
This will culminate in a location capable of housing over 1,000 volunteers with 920 office spaces and will accommodate audio video services,

00:57:01.730 --> 00:57:07.730
text processing, writing correspondence and the art department.

00:57:07.730 --> 00:57:12.679
Planning and engineering are already underway.

00:57:12.679 --> 00:57:16.679
We are beginning our discussions with the local authorities on this project.

00:57:16.679 --> 00:57:28.679
In Jehovah willing, we hope to start site work in 2022 and have a completed facility by December 31, 2026.

00:57:28.679 --> 00:57:39.679
One year ago this week, in October, the teaching committee was discussing all that has been asked of audio video services, all the videos that they're producing,

00:57:39.679 --> 00:57:51.679
and we could see that it was a little bit difficult because this department was spread out over four different complexes, ten different buildings and 16 different floors.

00:57:51.679 --> 00:57:56.679
So working together and collaborating has been a little difficult being spread out.

00:57:56.679 --> 00:58:04.679
If you go back some years, it was planned to increase the Bethel facility, expand the Bethel facility at Patterson, New York.

00:58:04.679 --> 00:58:11.679
Yet at that time, there were two large construction projects underway at Walgill and Warwick.

00:58:11.679 --> 00:58:19.679
So another construction project, it was just not feasible at that time, but audio video services still had needs, immediate needs.

00:58:19.679 --> 00:58:27.679
So at that time, the governing body approved to purchase the building in Mount Ebo as a temporary solution.

00:58:27.679 --> 00:58:40.679
The use of video in our teaching programs was exploding, and so there was a need for much more studio space and the associated spaces to support video production.

00:58:40.679 --> 00:59:00.679
After searching the area of Patterson for additional space, this property in Mount Ebo rose to the top, was a smooth transaction, and we were in renovating and using the space very quickly, which all of us have benefited from since.

00:59:00.679 --> 00:59:12.679
And the intent was that AVS would use it for ten years or so, and then when a more permanent facility became available, the Mount Ebo would be sold to recoup the original purchase price.

00:59:12.679 --> 00:59:18.679
So Ramapo will become that more permanent studio location.

00:59:18.679 --> 00:59:28.679
When any functional department is split up over multiple locations, it can involve a degree of inefficiency, and it can also involve a doubling up of tasks,

00:59:28.679 --> 00:59:32.679
which creates a complex framework for anyone to operate.

00:59:32.679 --> 00:59:43.679
So having all audio video services operating out of one facility will surely mean a much more collaborative environment for those brothers and sisters to work in.

00:59:43.679 --> 00:59:53.679
And the end result obviously will affect the preaching work that we do, and also the teaching that we get in our meetings at the assemblies and conventions.

00:59:53.679 --> 01:00:04.679
To be able to consolidate the operations, design was put together, costing was put to the design that was presented to the governing body.

01:00:04.679 --> 01:00:12.679
And they gave us the okay to go ahead and then meet again with the town of Ramapo, which now a decade later was an entirely new group of officials.

01:00:12.679 --> 01:00:16.679
To meet with them to see if we'd still get the same positive reception.

01:00:16.679 --> 01:00:22.679
And we had an excellent reception from them. They seemed to welcome us with open arms.

01:00:22.679 --> 01:00:32.679
Obviously we're going to have to meet their code and criteria, but they seem as though they want to have us develop that site as an audio video facility.

01:00:32.679 --> 01:00:37.679
Over the period of time that we held the property, we tried to sell it at different times.

01:00:37.679 --> 01:00:51.679
But despite our best efforts in a variety of different marketing exercises, there was very little interest expressed in the property at this time.

01:00:51.679 --> 01:00:58.679
And so when we began thinking about expansion again, it was logical to look through a property we already owned.

01:00:58.679 --> 01:01:17.679
For almost a year now we've been working with pre-construction activities. And of course that means thousands and thousands of hours in project planning and project design to be able to meet the requirements of the town and the state to be able to obtain a building permit for the project.

01:01:17.679 --> 01:01:28.679
And of course once that building permit is obtained and we've actually put shovel to the ground, then we would expect that we'd have four years or less to actually deliver the project.

01:01:28.679 --> 01:01:40.679
In recent projects that the governing body has directed such as the Britain branch, adaptability was foremost in the design of the offices.

01:01:40.679 --> 01:01:50.679
So therefore office space could be reconfigured as the needs of departments and functions at the branch changed on the Britain project.

01:01:50.679 --> 01:02:01.679
Some of the exciting no design features were for example there was no central laundry. So each room has laundry facilities in it so the occupant can do their own laundry.

01:02:01.679 --> 01:02:10.679
The multipurpose building on that site is a building that can be easily configured to various different functions.

01:02:10.679 --> 01:02:21.679
Creating a building that is modular allows the brothers as the needs evolve to modify the building with the smallest amount of renovation costs possible.

01:02:21.679 --> 01:02:32.679
These no design features are very flexible in their nature and that's very helpful because our dynamic organization is moving quickly and changes come fast as well.

01:02:32.679 --> 01:02:40.679
That allows us to move with it. We can reconfigure spaces without any major expense and keep up with those changes that will be made.

01:02:41.679 --> 01:02:55.679
The Ramapo Audio Video Studios will be the largest in our organization. There have been other audio video studios constructed around the world and lessons learned from these are already being brought forward to the Ramapo AV studio.

01:02:55.679 --> 01:03:07.679
But that means we need you. We need your prayers, your support, your strong backs because this project will call for thousands of volunteers.

01:03:07.679 --> 01:03:25.679
With as many as 1,500 volunteers a day during the peak of construction. But we have utmost confidence in Psalm 110 and verse 3 when it says your people will offer themselves willingly on the day of your military force.

01:03:25.679 --> 01:03:32.679
So do not hold back. Do whatever you can to support this exciting new initiative.

01:03:32.679 --> 01:03:43.679
We will need thousands upon thousands of willing volunteers who are available for one week to one month or six months wherever the case may be to help with this project.

01:03:43.679 --> 01:03:53.679
On recent large scale projects we found it very successful to hire contractors for the specialized or the heavily mechanised parts of the work.

01:03:53.679 --> 01:04:08.679
Such as the steel superstructures or the concrete superstructures of the buildings, the building envelopes, cladding or roofing and then to get volunteers to carry out the all important hidden work or where the detail really makes the difference.

01:04:08.679 --> 01:04:16.679
For example the underground utilities or the site works, the mechanical and electrical fit out of the buildings as well as the all important finishes.

01:04:16.679 --> 01:04:26.679
We want to work with the LDC to identify brothers and sisters that can help and be trained now. They could either be assigned to local projects with the LDC.

01:04:26.679 --> 01:04:37.679
Some of them could be invited to start helping on renovation projects like the one at Patterson. And this will allow us to start giving them valuable training now that will be useful on the Ramapo project.

01:04:37.679 --> 01:04:46.679
We're hoping on the Ramapo project that Jehovah's Spirit will energise the brotherhood again as it did at Warwick and also in the Britain project.

01:04:46.679 --> 01:04:57.679
Really seen from the initial concept design through the estimating and establishing budgets and reviewing the personnel needs all the way to the first initial meetings with the town.

01:04:57.679 --> 01:05:10.679
Prayerful consideration was given by all the brothers and sisters involved and so we could really see in every one of those decisions that Jehovah was steering this project and he knows already how it will be completed.

01:05:10.679 --> 01:05:22.679
Going back more than a decade ago from between 2005 to 2009, when we were searching for property, these two properties became available and they both seemed as though they were suitable.

01:05:23.679 --> 01:05:37.679
And it was the organization's decision to go with one and not develop the other. Now when it seems like there is a real need, we can develop the second property that we already have, that we already own and we already have a good reception with.

01:05:37.679 --> 01:05:50.679
To me, those things are face strengthening because what I see is that the work we were doing a decade ago and that the brothers and sisters and work involved with it in the branch committee, we didn't know what the outcome might be.

01:05:50.679 --> 01:05:58.679
And we didn't know what the use might be over this last decade. But now what we have is something that can be very suitable as we move forward.

01:05:58.679 --> 01:06:01.679
And to me, that's face strengthening. I see Jehovah's hand in that.

01:06:01.679 --> 01:06:14.679
Projects like this, in addition to serving a very practical need, offer an opportunity for Jehovah's people to show their thankfulness and their zeal for him.

01:06:14.679 --> 01:06:33.679
And as we experience with Warwick, just the project alone and the participation of our brothers and sisters from all over the country resulted in a spiritual blessing to thousands of individuals, their families and their congregations.

01:06:33.679 --> 01:06:39.679
And we fully expect this project will have the same positive effect.

01:06:39.679 --> 01:06:46.679
On a project of this scale, the early strategic decisions are absolutely crucial.

01:06:46.679 --> 01:06:59.679
Now what we've seen with the design and project planning teams coming together, with the plans for the support, feeding, housing and care of the volunteers,

01:06:59.679 --> 01:07:10.679
with the spirit that's already evident amongst those who are involved in the project. And also the strong backing of the Governor Body, we clearly see that Jehovah's hand is with us.

01:07:10.679 --> 01:07:17.679
James, four eight states, draw close to God and he will draw close to you.

01:07:17.679 --> 01:07:25.679
Yes, Jehovah is allowing once every opportunity to draw close to him as never before.

01:07:25.679 --> 01:07:36.679
And he is speaking to them through his inspired word, as well as vivid artwork, beautiful music and heart-touching videos.

01:07:36.679 --> 01:08:27.619
And it's the feeling of the entire governing body that this new site will allow us to produce even more wonderful products to help us to do just that.

01:08:27.619 --> 01:08:31.939
Good to note your enthusiasm.

01:08:31.939 --> 01:08:37.939
You're encouraging to hear that information. This was the first part.

01:08:37.939 --> 01:08:50.939
In parts two and three of the annual meeting, you'll hear six talks by governing body members that refine our understanding of Bible truths and strengthen our trust in Jehovah.

01:08:50.939 --> 01:08:59.939
Make sure to watch them when they appear in the video on the month section of JW Broadcasting in the next few weeks.

01:08:59.939 --> 01:09:07.939
To conclude this month's program, let's travel to Papua Nagini. It is located in the southwestern Pacific Ocean.

01:09:07.939 --> 01:09:15.939
Papua Nagini covers the eastern half of the island of New Guinea and includes other islands and atolls.

01:09:15.939 --> 01:09:25.939
There are three official languages in Papua Nagini. English, Harry Motu and the most widely used official language, Tok Pisin.

01:09:25.939 --> 01:09:35.939
Besides these three official languages, it is estimated that there are over 800 other languages spoken here.

01:09:35.939 --> 01:09:44.939
Many of these have fewer than 1,000 people. This presents a huge challenge in the ministry.

01:09:44.939 --> 01:09:51.939
Our brothers use preaching cards and high traffic areas to catch the attention of those passing by.

01:09:51.939 --> 01:09:58.939
And they use these videos available in the local language to teach the good news.

01:09:58.939 --> 01:10:06.939
And the Quiver Golo congregation, they walk up to five hours just to reach their scattered territory.

01:10:06.939 --> 01:10:11.939
Their determination in the preaching work is producing good fruit.

01:10:11.939 --> 01:10:18.939
The 34 publishers are conducting an average of 38 Bible studies.

01:10:18.939 --> 01:10:27.939
They hold their congregation meetings in Harry Motu and their preaching is done primarily in the local language of Tubulamo.

01:10:27.939 --> 01:10:36.939
When building the kingdom, these brothers did all of the excavation manually since machines were not available.

01:10:36.939 --> 01:10:46.939
Then they carried all of the building supplies up the mountain by hand. A trip that takes two to three hours.

01:10:46.939 --> 01:10:54.939
Our brothers send you their warm love and greetings. And we send ours in return.

01:10:54.939 --> 01:10:59.939
