00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:08.259
While meditating on the text this morning, I was reminded of an experience I had many years ago as a missionary.

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:15.259
At the time I was studying with a young man who was training to be a pastor in his church.

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:24.260
This man had got to the point where he started to attend all our meetings while at the same time still attending his church gatherings.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.260
The church obviously was very disturbed about the fact that he was coming to the meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.259
and the headquarters sent in a missionary from overseas to try and rectify the situation.

00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:38.259
The young man told me what happened.

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:44.259
He said, the missionary asked him, what is it that impresses you about Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:48.259
He said, well, one of the things is that they do the preaching work.

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:53.259
The missionary replied, well, our church can do that too.

00:00:53.259 --> 00:01:05.260
So the next time they had a service, the missionary conducted the service and with great zeal and enthusiasm demanded that everyone in the church take part in the preaching work.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.260
He announced the time that they would have the group to go preaching.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.260
The young man told me quite a number of people came along, but there's just one thing missing.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
You guessed it, the missionary.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:24.260
He felt that it was enough just to encourage everybody else to do it without engaging in it himself.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:33.260
How different was the example of Jesus and of our hardworking elders who do take the lead with regard to the preaching work?

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:42.260
Let's take our Bibles and turn to a very interesting scripture in Hebrews 13 and verse 7 and 17.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.260
I'd like to highlight the beauty of the New World Transition in these two verses.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:02:00.260
You see at the beginning of verse 7, remember those who are taking the lead among you and then verse 17, be obedient to those who are taking the lead among you.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:08.259
If you look at other Bibles, whether it's new or old, most of them say, your leaders.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:17.259
Obviously, the New World Transition Committee had in mind Jesus' comments with regard to no one being a leader among us,

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:25.259
and although it's a different word in the Greek text, still in English, we can't help but be sensitive to that matter.

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:33.259
This accurate translation of saying, taking the lead really summarizes, doesn't it, what the role is of an elder.

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:37.259
We're not leaders, but we set the right example.

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:47.259
Now, this accurate translation is also portrayed in the words of Lord Jesus Christ as recorded in Luke chapter 22,

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:56.259
and you'll be interested to note that this is part of the revision of the New World Transition text, Luke 226.

00:02:56.259 --> 00:03:06.259
It now portrays accurately the fact that both expressions in Hebrew and this one here are the same word.

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:18.259
So, Luke chapter 22 verse 26, it says, you, though, are not to be that way, but let the one who is the greatest among you become as the youngest.

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:21.259
And then notice, and the one taking the lead.

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:27.259
Now, this is the same expression as in Hebrews as the one ministering.

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:37.259
So, obviously, to take the lead means to do the work, to be a minister, to be a servant, to serve others.

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:44.259
This also reminds me many years ago when I worked with the translation team in the Pacific Nation of Samoa.

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:51.259
At that point, we were trying to select an accurate expression to convey this thought of taking the lead.

00:03:51.259 --> 00:04:00.259
And there were two words, eventually, that the brothers were trying to select between a choose between one was the word ta-i and the other ta-i-mua.

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:02.259
Now, you don't have to remember those words.

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:09.259
But as a foreigner, I didn't really understand the subtleties between the difference of the two words.

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:14.259
So, I asked the brothers, how can you explain to me what these two words mean?

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:21.259
So, one of the brothers was very eloquently, he said, well, just imagine a procession, a parade.

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:27.259
So, ta-i is the old man who sits on the side of the road barking out the orders.

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:30.259
You should do it this way, you should do it that way.

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:38.259
The ta-i-mua, on the other hand, is the one right in the front of the parade, taking the lead, and everyone's following them.

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:41.259
Which word do you think we selected?

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:46.259
Doesn't that summarize nicely? Just exactly what's involved with being an elder.

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:55.259
It's not a matter of sitting on the sidelines barking out orders, but getting involved, setting the right example, and then others following.

00:04:55.259 --> 00:05:00.259
And this is in harmony with one Greek lexicon that describes this expression this way.

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:10.259
It says, the concept of leading can be expressed by showing how to do something, demonstrating how we ought to do it, and going ahead showing the way.

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:18.259
Of course, on the other hand, some religions even viewed the expression elder as a title.

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:21.259
You've probably heard of them introducing themselves.

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:24.259
Good morning, I'm Elder Jackson.

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:33.259
Well, of course, none of us would want to view being an elder as a title in the sense of a position that lords it over others.

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:40.259
And with that in mind, another subtlety to the revision is seen in 1st Timothy chapter 3.

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:43.259
So please turn there with me.

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:47.259
1st Timothy, chapter 3 and verse 1.

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:55.259
These are well-known words, particularly when our brothers are considering the qualifications for elders.

00:05:55.259 --> 00:06:01.259
But you may or may not have seen the subtlety of the change here in this revision.

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:06.259
It says, now, this statement is trustworthy.

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:13.259
If a man is reaching out to be an overseer, he is desirous of a fine work.

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:23.259
Do you remember before the original New World Transition said, if someone is reaching out for the office of being an overseer?

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:32.259
And they're that reflected and know that was influenced by the King James and many of the older transitions that translated it that way.

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:42.259
But when we look at the rest of the verse, we see that it's not the office or the position of being an overseer that someone reaches out for.

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:44.259
Rather, it's the work.

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:49.259
Yes, the hard work that needs to be done by an overseer.

00:06:49.259 --> 00:07:03.259
An overseer recognizes that he needs to work hard as setting a right example and then others will follow rather than just telling everyone what they should do.

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:10.259
So when we look at these subtlety in the New World Transition, it only helps us to appreciate it even more, doesn't it?

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:15.259
So with this in mind, what does that text this morning help us to keep in mind?

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:19.259
Well, as elders, what do we need to do?

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:33.259
Not sit on the sidelines barking out orders, but rather to take the lead, be in the forefront, do the work, and then others will follow our example just as we follow the example of Jesus.
