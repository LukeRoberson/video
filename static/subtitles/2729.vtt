00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.900
I was 53 years old.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.900
I was known as a troublemaker.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.900
I was fighting in the bars,

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.899
come to a point where you began to enjoy it.

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:19.899
He was flat out scary.

00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:22.899
He was a very mean and violent man.

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:26.899
So everybody kind of kept their distance from him.

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:30.899
My language was too testable.

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:34.899
I would make good men blush by the things that I could say

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:36.899
and things that I would do.

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.899
It was involved with some bikers,

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:40.899
and they were trying to prospect me

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:42.899
into getting into their club.

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.899
Things were escalating.

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:46.899
We got married very young,

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.899
and we were 17.

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:51.899
And had my oldest daughter?

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.899
I was the mom, and he lived a life

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.899
of being out with his friends and partying.

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:01.899
About that time, my wife started studying a Bible

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:03.899
which I always witnessed.

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.900
It was a big change for her,

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.900
but she explained the reason behind it.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.900
I couldn't argue with it.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.900
She talked me into studying.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.900
I studied a fun 28 years old to 30.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.900
I always seen it.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.900
I always seen it.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.900
I knew this was what I needed to be.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.900
Somehow, I just couldn't ever break free

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:24.900
of the person that I was.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.900
My mom always raised us in the truth,

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.900
growing up, and that's what we knew.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.900
So then to see my dad,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.900
where he was so different.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.900
But yet believed it to be the truth.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.900
And then to see that his lifestyle

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.900
didn't do him any good,

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.900
was kind of a good example.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.900
Of a bad example, if that makes sense.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.180
I was afraid of the change.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.180
People accepted me for who I was.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.180
Being a tough guy.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.180
Being Jimmy Brown.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.180
The scripture comes to mind.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.180
I planted a polished water.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.180
God kept making it grow.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.180
Many brothers have studied with Jim

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.180
from time to time over the years.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.180
I just happened to be the one

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.180
at the time in his life

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.180
when he was taking the truth

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.180
and running with it.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.180
Wanted to be a better person.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.180
Actually, you know,

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.180
this was just not a way of life

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.180
that I wanted anymore.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.180
He changed his friends.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.180
He changed his life.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.180
He changed his dress and grooming.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.180
He changed his speech patterns.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.180
He changed the way he was a grandfather.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.180
He changed the way he was a father.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.180
He changed the way he was a husband.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.180
Everything changed about him.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.740
I knew of the work that witnesses do.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.740
Going out toward the door.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.740
Talking to people.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.740
I thought I could never do that.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.740
Whoa. Me going toward the door.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.740
I'm going to run into people that I know.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.740
Did I drink with for years and years?

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.740
How can I face them now?

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.740
I had always told my wife

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.740
would be much easier for you to become a witness.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.740
If I didn't live here.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.740
But how wrong I was

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.740
because, what a witness.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.740
My changes have been to so many people in town.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.740
I love life now.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.740
I have two friends.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.740
I know that I have hope for the future.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.740
Jehovah has seen something in me.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.139
And he's brought it to light.

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.139
I am a good person.

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.139
I can be a good human being.

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:31.139
I can hope other people.

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:35.139
I can be loved by him.

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.460
Surprise us.
