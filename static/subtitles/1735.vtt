00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.140
Well, I was a special pioneer in Waxahatchee, Texas.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.140
That was back in 1940 when there was a lot of mob violence.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.539
And we were in the Waxahatchee jail.

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.539
89 of us were arrested there.

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.140
That's how I got to know Lorraine.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.740
And in August of 31st is when we got married.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.939
Then afterwards, we were sent to Palestine, Texas.

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:44.740
And afterwards back to Waxahatchee.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.240
And then from Waxahatchee to Dallas.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.840
And Dallas is when we received our secret letter.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.740
Nobody was supposed to know anything about it.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.740
We were living in the same trailer campus.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.240
My wife's folks.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.039
So we couldn't even tell them about it.

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:02.539
My wife and I from the very time we,

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.340
even before we got married,

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.239
we decided that any assignment that society gave us,

00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:09.040
we would accept.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.340
Well, we still didn't feel we were worthy of it.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.540
But we sold the car and the trailer.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.540
Said goodbye to everybody because we never thought

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.040
we'd get back to see them again.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.640
Because at that time, why the World War II was on.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.840
And well, we thought the end was nearby.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.540
That was 1st of February, 1943.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.340
We went to Gilead.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.739
They had a terrific north storm.

00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:43.040
And of course, the school started the 1st of February.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.239
Brother Nore, he was president at that time.

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:48.140
He introduced us all.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.040
And we went on into the classrooms.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.079
And for five months, we were there at Gilead.

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.480
We were the guinea pigs of the Gilead school.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.579
Because we were the first ones.

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.379
No instructors, the program was new.

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:06.079
In fact, everything was new.

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.780
It was a difficult course.

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:14.180
I was educated in a small country school.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.979
And of course, went to the eighth grade and eighth grade

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:19.479
and two years in high school.

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:21.180
And I went into the pioneer work.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.680
So it was difficult.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.879
We went through the whole Bible.

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.479
And then also Bible prophecies.

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:31.479
We had to learn to study.

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:34.280
But it was a real training.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.180
It trained us for future missionary service.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.580
After that, we were sent to Cuba.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.580
We lived on a $25 allowance.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.080
So we had a pair of rent.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.879
We had a buyer of food.

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.879
And also buyer furniture.

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.879
We slept on the floor the first night.

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.379
Next day, we went out and bought our beds.

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:58.680
We bought in the market.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.180
We bought wood apple boxes.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.879
And we made our dressers and covered

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.479
out of those.

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:08.580
Literature placement was quite well.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.979
We went out with a phonograph at that time.

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:12.180
We used it.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.580
We played the record for four and a half minutes.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.780
And then we offer the literature.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.979
We go in a Bible study.

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:20.780
We take the English copy of the book.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.580
English copy of the Bible.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.080
And also the Spanish copy.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.979
And we finally saw that that wasn't necessary.

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:32.580
That was this hindering us from progressing

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.580
in the Spanish language.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.080
So we put our English books away and just worked in Spanish.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.479
Little by little, we caught on to the language.

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:47.580
The Cubans speak very, very fast.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.780
And we'd come out of a meeting.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.680
And our head would just be busting on us because of their

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.680
of the Spanish language.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.479
And of course, one puts such an effort

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:01.280
for us to learn the language.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.860
And after a few months while we were able to defend ourselves

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.159
we received some speaking assignments,

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:09.759
even on assemblies.

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:11.360
I don't know how the brothers understood us,

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.159
but the Cubans are very, are very loving people.

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:18.259
And all they just delight us to have us in their homes.

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:20.360
When we went to Cuba,

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.860
brother Nora talked to us the night before we left

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.459
from New York.

00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:30.560
And he says, I'm leaving you in Cuba for five years

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.259
or until you have 5,000 publishers.

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:35.860
He sent us a letter, five years later,

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.560
to the day inviting us to take a new assignment.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.060
We had the 5,000 publishers and we were there five years.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.060
So he must have written down some agenda,

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.360
some place as he wrote us to the day.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.540
In 1948, we were assigned to Argentina with four other

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.259
sisters.

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:58.959
When we arrived in Buenos Aires,

00:04:58.959 --> 00:05:01.860
there were 900 publishers in the country.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.459
After being in Buenos Aires for six months,

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:07.459
brother Nora came down.

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:09.759
And he assigned me the circuit work.

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:11.560
It's a big country.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.660
I've traveled all over the country.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:19.420
I know a good number of the brothers.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.620
We were never recognized as a religion in Argentina

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.480
until 1982.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.180
So we just saw the work move ahead.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.680
In 1975 or 1976,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.079
when the band was put on the work the second time,

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:39.779
we had 33,000 publishers in the country

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:42.779
and it dropped down to 27,000.

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:43.779
But even under the band,

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:45.779
while we just started going, moving ahead,

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:49.279
moving ahead, we even had small assemblies.

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:51.579
But when you look back over the years,

00:05:51.579 --> 00:05:55.480
there's no question that Jehovah's directed everything.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.680
He's permitted things to happen

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.279
and it just strengthens one's faith

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:01.680
that Jehovah's organization.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.779
There's no question about it.

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:08.079
Really, when one looks back over the years,

00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:10.579
we know we've taken the best course of life.
