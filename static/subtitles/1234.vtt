00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:08.580
I learned the truth as a child and since then have always had the struggle to conduct

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.580
myself in a way that pleases Jehovah.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.059
I don't find it easy to control my temper or to keep calm.

00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:22.379
When I first arrived in this country, a brother treated me in an unkind manner and was not

00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:25.629
very hospitable.

00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:30.829
Because of this, I started feeling resentment toward him.

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:37.149
So much so that when he called me on the phone, I spoke to him very rudely.

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:42.429
My wife had to help me, reminding me that both the brother and I are imperfect and that

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:46.070
the feelings I had toward him were not healthy.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.189
During that time I felt awful and really bad about my relationship with Jehovah.

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:54.909
Discipline is never a cause for joy.

00:00:54.909 --> 00:01:00.149
And especially when I receive a letter from the branch correcting and counseling me for

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.950
something I have not been doing right.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.549
It certainly makes me feel uncomfortable.

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:12.430
But I try to reflect on the fact that acting in a cord with Jehovah's wisdom will bring

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:19.670
me blessings, prayer to Jehovah, Bible principles, and trusting that Jehovah will give me the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.310
needed direction has really helped me.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.629
As the Psalms mention, Jehovah is aware that we are dust.

00:01:29.629 --> 00:01:36.670
It says, if he were saying to me, son, you make so many mistakes, but I love you anyway.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.230
I can use you in my service and I know that you will succeed.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.069
And of course, it's possible because Jehovah has always helped his servants.

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:59.200
All of them, from able down to our day, all of us who are serving him are imperfect people.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.719
One day I was doing some electrical work and I was electrocuted.

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:10.830
When the doctor saw me, he decided that it was necessary to amputate both my hands.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.590
I had lost my hands.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.069
There was so much I wouldn't be able to do.

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.389
How would I work?

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:20.830
How would I care for my children, for my wife?

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.069
The first thing I asked for was a Bible to see if I would be able to turn the pages.

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.629
And I could.

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.219
That made me so happy.

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:35.830
Now I am able to work to support my family.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.629
I work as a painter, welder and carpenter.

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.270
I can even drive myself to and from work.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.710
I have been able to work on my spiritual goals as I continue serving Jehovah, like being

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:56.669
an elder in the congregation and above all, helping my family to continue to grow spiritually.

00:02:56.669 --> 00:03:01.830
Keeping myself occupied with spiritual matters has meant that I don't dwell on my disability.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.110
In fact, sometimes I even forget that I am disabled.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.509
Jehovah has always sustained me.

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:14.069
Since the day of the accident, I have seen how Jehovah got by means of my family, my

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:20.069
wife and kids, and the brothers and sisters in the congregation has helped me to move on.

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.229
Once, after giving a talk, a young girl came up to me and gave me a letter and a drawing

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:27.229
she had done of me.

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:32.270
She thanked me and encouraged me by saying that very soon, Jehovah would give me my hands

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:41.009
back in the paradise, things like that, like being able to hold my wife's hand.

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:46.210
My children's too, to carry them and play with them.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.849
That's my hope.

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:57.740
And I have complete confidence that Jehovah will bring it about.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.460
I was arrested and sentenced to two and a half years in prison for my neutrality.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.740
The surroundings in prison were unfamiliar and overwhelming.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.180
I didn't know anyone and I didn't know what to expect from them.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.329
I was the only witness.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.129
I was continually praying to Jehovah for power and strength to be able to resolve any problems

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:26.009
in a peaceful manner and withstand any difficulties.

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:30.449
In that situation only prayer and God's word brought me comfort.

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.129
But then my Bible was taken away from me.

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:35.930
It was returned to me though sometime later.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.970
I was allowed to have literature on one condition that I would not preach.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:47.209
True, preaching wasn't allowed, but that didn't mean I wasn't allowed to speak, did it?

00:04:47.209 --> 00:04:52.970
I was determined that no matter what happened, I would remain faithful.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.930
My good conduct had a positive effect on the other prisoners.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.449
Some of them started reading the Bible.

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:04.769
Quite often I couldn't even get my turn to read it.

00:05:04.769 --> 00:05:08.769
I didn't swear and I kept myself physically clean.

00:05:08.769 --> 00:05:12.490
This didn't go unnoticed by the prison officials.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.529
One day they said to me, because you are morally and physically clean, we want you to be our

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:18.529
head cook.

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:25.569
That's how I became their chef.

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:29.170
I constantly saw evidence of Jehovah's hand.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.329
The ministry was amazing.

00:05:31.329 --> 00:05:35.170
There were months when I served up to 120 hours.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.769
I placed more than 100 pieces of literature.

00:05:38.769 --> 00:05:45.250
Thanks to Jehovah I was able to stay in full-time ministry the whole time I was in prison.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.529
This filled my heart with joy.

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:53.810
The thought at 1 Peter 5-9, which says that the entire association of brothers is experiencing

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.810
the same kind of suffering I was, strengthened me.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:03.170
I am confident that no matter what circumstances we find ourselves in, no matter who is around

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.209
us, Jehovah will never abandon us.

00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:10.209
The day for my release finally arrived.

00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:13.250
It was a complete surprise for my mother.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.639
I hadn't told her.

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:21.759
I will never forget that moment when we were reunited.
