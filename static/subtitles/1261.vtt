00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:17.239
I hope you want to play in your sleep in your day.

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:19.239
Actually, I was thinking about it.

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:22.239
Come on, Papa. Look how beautiful it is outside.

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:25.239
Okay.

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:32.750
I found this picture while cleaning the attic.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:54.409
I didn't know you played the violin.

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:57.409
Okay. Sergey is getting late. It's time to put the violin down.

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:01.409
A little longer. Please. My teacher says I'm really good.

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:06.230
It's true. You're playing better than I do now.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.230
A man from a music conservatory, a chemistry class,

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.230
and my teacher told me to play for him.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.230
Oh, and how did that go?

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.230
Well, first I was nervous. After I was done,

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.230
he asked me if I can attend a program for young gifted musicians.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.230
Hmm. And what did you tell him?

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.230
I told him I'd ask you for it. So can I please?

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.700
I don't think it's a good idea.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.700
But why? It's just playing the violin.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.700
You and I played together was a difference.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.700
The difference is we play violin for our enjoyment.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.700
It's different with the world.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.700
The pressure to be very best is so strong.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.700
And the spirit of competition,

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.700
it can become so great that it will consume you.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.700
I can handle it.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.700
Sergey, conservatory exists to convince young people

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.700
to make music their life, their career.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.700
You will be surrounded by people who don't love Jehovah.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.699
Can you handle that?

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.699
I don't know, but I really love it.

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:15.699
And I'm not good at anything else, but I'm good at this.

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:17.699
Can I just try for a little bit?

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:21.699
I think it will make only harder for you.

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:25.699
And Sergey, you don't have to give up playing.

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:28.699
We're still killing joy, playing beautiful music together,

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:30.699
like we always do.

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:32.699
It's not a conservatory.

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:34.699
That's right.

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:38.699
We must show Jehovah that we love him first.

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:40.699
I just don't understand.

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:43.699
One day you will understand.

00:02:43.699 --> 00:03:03.520
For now, I really appreciate you being obedient.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.520
Really appreciate you being obedient.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:27.009
Good answer, Alexey.

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:30.009
Natalia and I have really enjoyed our study, Sergey.

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:32.009
But we miss your father tonight.

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:34.009
We really hope his feeling better soon.

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:44.710
Who is it?

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.710
Alexey, that's me, Daniil.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:47.710
Let me in.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.710
Sorry, I'm late.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:50.710
It's okay, Daniil.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.710
We're glad you can join us.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:53.710
You're sure you weren't followed?

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:54.710
Yes, I'm sure.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.710
I passed a group of police on the way, but they did not see me.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.710
They were busy arresting a man.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.710
It's getting more and more dangerous.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:03.710
I'm so scared.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:04.710
It's true.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.710
These are dangerous times.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.710
What helps me is to think of the ones like Jeremiah and the Apostle Paul.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.710
They were ordinary people, just like us.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.710
But you have granted them the power beyond what is normal,

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.709
so that they were able to endure.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.709
When we meditate on examples like these, it gives us courage.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:34.430
Father?

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.660
Father!

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.660
I gave you some Alexander.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.660
We have been looking for you.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.660
Have you done with him?

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.660
I will ask the questions.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.660
Where is it?

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.660
Let him go.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.660
Please.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:49.660
He's sick.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.660
I will ask again.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.660
Where is it?

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.660
Where is it?

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.660
Where is what?

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.660
The seditious literature.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.660
Your religion produces.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.660
We know your Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.660
Why are you doing this?

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:05.660
We've done nothing.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.660
You know the law, and yet you chose to disobey it.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.660
You believe this is nothing, Sergey?

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.660
Now, tell us where to find your literature.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.660
Perhaps then.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.660
I will extend some consideration.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.660
I won't find anything here.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:23.660
We'll see.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:33.500
You play?

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:58.889
Play something.

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:00.889
No, no, no, no, no.

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:01.889
Not that.

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:03.889
Play the anthem for us.

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:04.889
No.

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:06.889
I will not.

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:17.850
We're loyal to our Jehovah.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.850
Why do you play for the wrong side?

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.850
When you know, there is only one outcome.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:50.339
Where I am convinced that neither death nor life nor angels

00:06:50.339 --> 00:07:01.420
nor governments will be able to separate us from God's love convinced.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:11.259
Now, brothers and sisters, come with me.

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:26.300
We have news about your father.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.300
How is he?

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:35.290
He's dying, Sergey.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.290
Can I see him?

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.290
You can do even more than that.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:41.290
You can take him home.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.290
We can leave?

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:45.290
Yes.

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.290
You can leave and never have to come back.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:52.290
Just sign this.

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:53.290
What is it?

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:56.290
I read it.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:02.600
Read it.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.600
No.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.600
This opportunity will not come again.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.600
I assure you.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.600
Renounce your religion and you both can leave.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.939
No.

00:08:14.939 --> 00:08:25.870
One has to know.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.870
My God will know.

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:30.870
Your God.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.870
Where is your God, Sergey?

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:37.279
Can he rescue you from this place?

00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:40.279
Can he give you back your life?

00:08:40.279 --> 00:08:41.279
Your father?

00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:45.720
You've been here for five months.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.720
Would you prefer to make it five more years?

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:53.220
Look at me, if not for yourself.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.220
Do it for your father.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.220
You love him, right?

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:07.799
Then prove you love for him.

00:09:07.799 --> 00:09:11.799
I love my father very much.

00:09:11.799 --> 00:09:16.799
We must show you who we love him first.

00:09:16.799 --> 00:09:19.799
But I love you first.

00:09:19.799 --> 00:09:25.210
And whatever happens, I will serve him.

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:28.870
Okay.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:30.870
You want to serve him?

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:34.379
Serve him.

00:09:34.379 --> 00:09:36.379
Enjoy your five years.

00:09:36.379 --> 00:09:38.379
Guard, take him.

00:09:38.379 --> 00:09:59.580
Who is Johor?

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.580
Thank you so much for that talk that was wonderful.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:02.580
Thank you.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:03.580
Sergey.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:07.110
Look, see.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:08.110
Natalia.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:10.110
Yes, it's fast.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:14.059
I haven't seen you both since...

00:10:14.059 --> 00:10:17.059
I know. It's been seventeen years.

00:10:17.059 --> 00:10:20.059
We pray for you least every night, Sergey.

00:10:20.059 --> 00:10:21.059
Thank you so much.

00:10:21.059 --> 00:10:24.059
When they announce your name as our substitute circuit,

00:10:24.059 --> 00:10:26.059
we see I couldn't believe it.

00:10:26.059 --> 00:10:28.059
Oh, I still can't believe it.

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:36.110
I wanted to meet my wife.

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:37.110
This is Anya.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:38.110
Nice to meet you.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:39.110
Nice to meet you.

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:40.110
Nice to meet you.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:41.110
Nice to meet you.

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:42.110
Nice to meet you.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:44.110
Your husband studied with us.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.110
It's wonderful to meet up again after all these years.

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:49.110
Would you both come to my home for dinner tonight?

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:52.110
It would mean so much to us.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:53.110
Sounds wonderful.

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.110
We would be happy to come.

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:56.110
Thank you.

00:10:56.110 --> 00:11:01.879
Thank you.

00:11:01.879 --> 00:11:16.289
All right.

00:11:16.289 --> 00:11:18.289
That was excellent.

00:11:18.289 --> 00:11:20.289
Like your talks, Sergey.

00:11:20.289 --> 00:11:25.289
Yes, it's rare for someone so young to teach us you do.

00:11:25.289 --> 00:11:26.289
No, I don't.

00:11:26.289 --> 00:11:28.289
Feather is right.

00:11:28.289 --> 00:11:31.289
You are wise beyond your years.

00:11:31.289 --> 00:11:34.289
Do you think your time in prison prepared you?

00:11:34.289 --> 00:11:37.289
I definitely had a lot of time to meditate, so...

00:11:37.289 --> 00:11:40.289
I guess it might have matured me a little.

00:11:40.289 --> 00:11:43.289
You were there nearly twice as long as most of us.

00:11:43.289 --> 00:11:48.289
We can only imagine how difficult those years were for you.

00:11:49.289 --> 00:11:52.289
Is it true you never saw your father again?

00:11:52.289 --> 00:11:54.289
It's true.

00:11:54.289 --> 00:11:58.289
You must be very strong to withstand that kind of pressure.

00:11:58.289 --> 00:12:00.289
Yeah, I suppose so.

00:12:00.289 --> 00:12:05.289
I wish you could be our real circuit overseer.

00:12:05.289 --> 00:12:08.289
We heard good things about brother Elin.

00:12:08.289 --> 00:12:11.289
Many good things. We hope to meet him soon.

00:12:11.289 --> 00:12:13.289
He is okay.

00:12:13.289 --> 00:12:16.289
But he is not the man of the people.

00:12:16.289 --> 00:12:18.289
You have suffered, like us.

00:12:18.289 --> 00:12:21.289
You understand us?

00:12:21.289 --> 00:12:24.289
We need someone like you.

00:12:24.289 --> 00:12:28.289
Brothers, I appreciate the praise, but I really don't deserve it.

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:29.289
Yes, you do.

00:12:29.289 --> 00:12:30.289
No.

00:12:30.289 --> 00:12:32.289
The praise should go to Jehovah.

00:12:32.289 --> 00:12:36.289
It is only because of his power that any of us can serve him the way we do.

00:12:36.289 --> 00:12:37.289
That's true.

00:12:37.289 --> 00:12:40.289
It's only because of Jehovah's spirit.

00:12:40.289 --> 00:12:42.289
He deserves the praise.

00:12:42.289 --> 00:12:44.289
And remember,

00:12:44.289 --> 00:12:50.289
Jehovah is the one who chooses those who serve in the congregations.

00:12:50.289 --> 00:12:53.289
Each of us has strengths that others don't have,

00:12:53.289 --> 00:12:55.289
but Jehovah sees them all.

00:12:55.289 --> 00:12:59.289
And he knows how to use them to advance his will.

00:12:59.289 --> 00:13:05.289
So we must trust Jehovah and be determined to appreciate the ones he has chosen to use.

00:13:05.289 --> 00:13:18.659
Sergei, what is it?

00:13:18.659 --> 00:13:24.049
Victor wants to see you.

00:13:24.049 --> 00:13:26.049
Sergei, yes, Victor.

00:13:26.049 --> 00:13:28.049
You are doing because I need your help.

00:13:28.049 --> 00:13:31.049
Dimitri is sick and I have no one else to cover for him.

00:13:31.049 --> 00:13:32.049
Which Dimitri?

00:13:32.049 --> 00:13:34.049
He works at our sister plan.

00:13:34.049 --> 00:13:36.049
And I need you to start working there beginning tomorrow.

00:13:36.049 --> 00:13:38.049
Where is it at the plan?

00:13:38.049 --> 00:13:39.049
About an hour away.

00:13:39.049 --> 00:13:42.549
An hour away?

00:13:42.549 --> 00:13:43.549
Look, Victor.

00:13:43.549 --> 00:13:47.549
With all due respect, I really appreciate this job.

00:13:47.549 --> 00:13:48.549
Really.

00:13:48.549 --> 00:13:51.549
But I've been covering for several people in the last few months.

00:13:51.549 --> 00:13:53.549
And I already feel very exhausted.

00:13:53.549 --> 00:13:55.549
Do you think you could find somebody else?

00:13:55.549 --> 00:13:58.549
Well, but I have family now and other responsibilities.

00:13:58.549 --> 00:13:59.549
Other responsibilities.

00:13:59.549 --> 00:14:01.549
My congregation.

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:02.549
Ah.

00:14:02.549 --> 00:14:05.549
Your religious beliefs again.

00:14:05.549 --> 00:14:08.549
Well, I give you time for your meetings, don't I?

00:14:08.549 --> 00:14:09.549
Yes.

00:14:09.549 --> 00:14:13.549
Remember, I do this not because I value your religion,

00:14:13.549 --> 00:14:15.549
but because I value your work.

00:14:15.549 --> 00:14:18.549
You're welcome and look for another job.

00:14:18.549 --> 00:14:20.549
But I doubt you're going to find an employer

00:14:20.549 --> 00:14:24.549
as understanding as I am concerning your religious beliefs.

00:14:24.549 --> 00:14:27.549
Well, as I said, Victor, I really appreciate this job

00:14:27.549 --> 00:14:30.549
and all the extra consideration has been shown to me.

00:14:30.549 --> 00:14:45.009
I guess I'll just cover for Dimitri.

00:14:45.009 --> 00:14:46.009
Have a good day.

00:14:46.009 --> 00:15:03.980
We'll be ready for a family study when you get home.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:06.980
Just as it is written,

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:12.330
for your sake, we're being put to death all day long.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.330
We have an accountidest ship for slaughtering.

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:24.379
On the contrary, in all these things,

00:15:24.379 --> 00:15:27.379
we are coming off completely victorious

00:15:27.379 --> 00:15:30.379
for the one who loved us.

00:15:30.379 --> 00:15:34.460
We can't be victorious.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:43.259
So, how are my girls doing?

00:15:43.259 --> 00:15:48.259
Papa, we've been practicing for the study tonight.

00:15:48.259 --> 00:15:51.259
I'm going to be married and Mama's going to be married.

00:15:51.259 --> 00:15:53.259
I guess that makes me Jesus.

00:15:53.259 --> 00:15:56.259
Yeah, I hope you're ready for tonight.

00:15:56.259 --> 00:15:58.259
Yes, I'm ready.

00:15:58.259 --> 00:15:59.259
I'm ready, sweetheart.

00:15:59.259 --> 00:16:01.259
I wouldn't miss it for anything.

00:16:02.259 --> 00:16:04.259
All right.

00:16:04.259 --> 00:16:31.259
Irina, I'd like you to meet a very dear friend of ours, Natalia.

00:16:31.259 --> 00:16:32.259
Hello.

00:16:32.259 --> 00:16:35.259
I knew your father when he was close to your age.

00:16:35.259 --> 00:16:37.259
He helped me learn the truth.

00:16:37.259 --> 00:16:38.259
He did.

00:16:38.259 --> 00:16:40.259
He was a good teacher too.

00:16:40.259 --> 00:16:42.259
Very patient.

00:16:42.259 --> 00:16:45.259
Where is Alexei because we were hoping to see him too?

00:16:45.259 --> 00:16:47.259
He's not here.

00:16:47.259 --> 00:16:50.259
Maybe we could stop by and see him tomorrow if I will leave.

00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:51.259
Yeah.

00:16:51.259 --> 00:16:52.259
You can't.

00:16:52.259 --> 00:16:53.259
Why not?

00:16:53.259 --> 00:16:55.259
What's wrong, Natalia?

00:16:55.259 --> 00:16:56.259
Is he sick?

00:16:56.259 --> 00:17:01.720
What is it?

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.720
What does it tell us?

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:08.720
A few months ago, Alexei left the truth.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.720
Oh, no.

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:15.140
He's so sorry, Natalia.

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:27.539
A word made began feeding his mind with doubts about the organization.

00:17:27.539 --> 00:17:32.539
Pretty soon, those doubts turn into belief.

00:17:32.539 --> 00:17:40.490
And he left.

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:43.490
Everyone's been so supportive in the congregation.

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:47.490
And Jehovah, he has never left me.

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:48.490
Yeah.

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:51.490
I remember your words about courage all those years ago.

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:55.490
I just didn't want to tell you because I knew how much I would hurt you.

00:17:55.490 --> 00:18:07.599
I just can't believe it.

00:18:07.599 --> 00:18:33.259
He's been like a second father to me.

00:18:33.259 --> 00:18:36.259
Now it feels like it was two.

00:18:36.259 --> 00:18:38.500
You know?

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:42.960
He may still come back.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.960
It's been my earnest wish that he does.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:50.259
Mine too.

00:18:50.259 --> 00:18:59.670
I love you so much.

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:00.670
People might leave.

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:07.470
But Jehovah never will.

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:10.470
He will never abandon his loyal ones.

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:12.470
For I'm convinced.

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:15.230
Remember?

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:16.230
Yeah.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:36.430
I found this picture while cleaning the attic.

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:39.809
Didn't know you played the violin.

00:19:39.809 --> 00:19:41.809
I lost interest in it, I guess.

00:19:41.809 --> 00:19:50.289
Sergey, Irina, good afternoon.

00:19:50.289 --> 00:19:52.289
Is it?

00:19:52.289 --> 00:19:54.289
I have received your test results.

00:19:54.289 --> 00:19:56.289
I wish I had better news.

00:19:56.289 --> 00:19:58.289
It's okay, go ahead.

00:19:58.289 --> 00:19:59.289
We have to operate.

00:19:59.289 --> 00:20:02.289
All right.

00:20:02.289 --> 00:20:04.289
But remember, no blood.

00:20:04.289 --> 00:20:06.289
I will do my best.

00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:09.289
But your best option is a broad transfusion.

00:20:09.289 --> 00:20:12.289
Without it, your chances are much lower.

00:20:12.289 --> 00:20:14.289
They understand what I'm trying to say.

00:20:14.289 --> 00:20:21.700
Yeah, I understand.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.700
And thank you, Doctor, for doing your best.

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:29.680
Leaving this choice to me.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.680
My stand is the same.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.680
Very well.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.680
We'll schedule the surgery for the end of this week.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:39.680
And we have to run a few more tests this afternoon.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.680
But I will give you a few minutes first.

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:43.680
Thank you.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:54.670
I love you, Barbara.

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.670
I know you'll make it through.

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:58.670
Mama always said he was strong.

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:01.980
I love you too, sweetheart.

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:11.150
Should something happen,

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:18.869
keep your hope anchored on that wonderful day.

00:21:18.869 --> 00:21:22.869
The day when your mom and I

00:21:22.869 --> 00:21:26.869
will be reunited with you in the new world.

00:21:26.869 --> 00:21:28.869
Promise me?

00:21:28.869 --> 00:21:42.779
I promise.

00:21:42.779 --> 00:21:59.980
I'll see you out.

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:03.980
We must show you a way that we love him first.

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:18.190
For I'm convinced that neither death, alive,

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:22.190
nor angels, nor governments,

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:26.190
nor things now hear or things to come,

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:30.190
nor powers, nor height, nor depth,

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:32.190
nor any other creation,

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:36.190
will be able to separate us from God's love.

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:39.190
That is in Christ Jesus, our Lord.

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:45.799
For I'm convinced.
