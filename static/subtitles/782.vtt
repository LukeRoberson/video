00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:06.639
Jehovah is the most generous person in the universe.

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:11.400
He is the giver of every good and every perfect present.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.399
And no doubt you, Gilead students, have thanked Jehovah many times

00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:23.559
for the numerous spiritual gifts that you have received over the past five months.

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:30.879
I recall what one of you said in your introduction, Gilead is an undeserved gift.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.280
What I would like to ask you now is, have you experienced over these five months

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:43.439
the gift of God that's mentioned in Ecclesiastes chapter 3 and verses 12 and 13?

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:50.780
Let's have a look at these verses together. Ecclesiastes 3, 12 and 13.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.979
I have concluded that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:01.340
and to do good during their life, also that everyone should eat and drink

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:08.219
and find enjoyment for all his hard work. It is the gift of God.

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:15.579
So this verse offers a very simple formula for enjoying life if we're blessed with good health.

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:22.540
There is nothing better than to eat and drink and find enjoyment for hard work.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.379
Why is that? Because it is the gift of God.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.579
Now as explained in verse 12, the work which produces feelings of enjoyment and

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:41.579
satisfaction is, you know, to do good. That is, good deeds on behalf of others.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.939
As Jesus said, there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:57.099
Proverbs 8 verse 30 also tells us that as a master worker, Jesus rejoiced

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:02.540
or as the Hebrew word for rejoice implies, he had a good time.

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:09.900
Yes, he had a good time working with his father over billions of years, creating the universe.

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:15.979
Now we may be a long way from being blessed as a master worker,

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:23.020
but all can enjoy the satisfaction that comes from doing good work in Jehovah's service.

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:28.699
And don't you find that it's this feeling itself that is a gift from God.

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:38.460
Now if you turn with me to Ecclesiastes chapter 5, verses 18 and 19, expands on this thought.

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:46.139
Ecclesiastes 5 verse 18, this is what I have seen to be good and proper,

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.460
that one should eat and drink and find enjoyment for all the hard work at which he

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.139
toils under the sun during the few days of life that the true God has given him,

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:07.419
for that is his reward. Also, when the true God gives a man riches and material possessions

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:14.780
along with the ability to enjoy them, he should take his reward and rejoice in his hard work.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:24.780
This is the gift of God. Now in effect, the Bible writer wisely recommends two things here.

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:34.539
One, work diligently from day to day and two, enjoy what you have right now.

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:42.060
Now when we recognize that our prosperity is a gift from God, we get a lot of personal

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:49.500
enjoyment from what we possess. And you notice that twice in these verses, this gift of God

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:57.340
is described as a reward from Jehovah to us. It's not a beautiful thought that Jehovah chooses to

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.900
reward us for our hard work. And I'm sure you agree that Gilead has added an abundance of

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:11.580
spiritual treasures to your possessions. In the coming years, you will find enjoyment again

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:18.139
and again, when you recall an explanation of a verse that you discovered during your personal

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:23.420
study, or that you gleaned from one of your instructors during a class lesson.

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:33.339
Like travelers abroad, you have collected priceless souvenirs. Now if you're still in Ecclesiastes

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:40.620
5, let's have a look at verse 20. Because this verse explains how the gift of God can affect our

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:47.980
outlook on life. It says, for he will hardly notice, or as the footnote says, remember,

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:56.139
he will hardly notice the passing days of his life, because the true God keeps him preoccupied

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:04.220
with the rejoicing of his heart. Time flies is a very common refrain here at Bethel.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:12.939
And isn't that so true when we enjoy our work? We hardly notice that our days, weeks, years,

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:24.060
even life itself seems to fly by. Therefore the advice is, save the moment. As one famous quote says,

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:32.939
yesterday is the past, tomorrow is the future, but today is a gift, and that is why they call it

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:46.300
the present. And there are benefits to being busy. The gift of God can help us to protect our

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:52.379
mental well-being. When we are preoccupied with interesting work, we don't become

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:58.060
unduly concerned with the brevity of life and its problems and uncertainties.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:04.540
Rather we get so much enjoyment from doing good, like Jesus having a good time,

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:12.300
that the negative aspects of life tend not to dominate our thinking. You see, we become

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:23.259
joyful at heart. So enjoy that feeling. It is a gift from God. Now the past 20 weeks of schooling

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:30.860
was hard work, wasn't it? Your minds were stretched, yet hasn't time flown by since you introduced

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:37.180
yourselves to us on November the 6th, last year. Well, now it's time to relax,

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:45.100
to eat and drink, in moderation, of course, with your family and friends as you reflect on your

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:54.699
gillied experience. So now is the time to savor the reward from Jehovah. The same wise writer also

00:06:54.699 --> 00:07:00.220
suggested a good balance between work and rest when he wrote at Ecclesiastes 4vs6.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:07.500
Better is a handful of rest than two handfuls of hard work. Now think about that.

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:15.339
A workaholic has no time or energy left to participate in restful activities that are designed to

00:07:15.339 --> 00:07:23.339
refresh and rejuvenate us. So we have to be modest about work, especially when we really love

00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:31.899
our assignments. The Bible encourages a balanced view. Work hard and enjoy the rewards.

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:39.980
We may thoroughly enjoy our work, but we must remember that work is even more enjoyable

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:44.860
if we take time to relax and reflect with pleasure on that work.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:52.060
Now since it's likely that many of you will receive new and enjoyable privileges which will

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:57.740
increase your workload, this is good and timely advice from the Scriptures. Is it not?

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:04.779
Now may I invite you to turn to 2 Timothy chapter 1 and verse 6.

00:08:06.699 --> 00:08:11.660
Because this verse conveys another positive dimension to the expression,

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:17.740
the gift of God, as you look to future assignments. It says,

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:25.019
for this reason I remind you to stir up like a fire, the gift of God that is in you

00:08:25.019 --> 00:08:32.299
through the laying of my hands on you. Now if you to look at the study note, it says this,

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:39.179
the gift that Paul here mentions seems to involve a gift of Holy Spirit,

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:46.700
the imparting to Timothy of some special ability that helped him to fulfill his assignment.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:54.779
Now of course, Gilead students do not have scholastic abilities conferred upon them by God, do they?

00:08:56.379 --> 00:09:03.580
One of you even said in your introduction, we're just ordinary battle lights, living extra-ordinary

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:13.019
lives. Now while that may be true, nevertheless, Gilead training has perhaps helped you to discover

00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:20.620
and nurture hidden talents that you never knew you had. True? Your instructors may have noticed

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:30.639
if you didn't. All of us who enjoy service privileges like Timothy need to treasure our gift of

00:09:30.639 --> 00:09:39.120
God. Service privileges are expressions of Jehovah's undeserved kindness, not a reward for months of

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:47.360
study. In fact, all of our energies, our abilities, our talents may be viewed as gifts from Jehovah

00:09:48.559 --> 00:09:55.519
and they have the purpose of doing good towards other people. Now if that's our outlook and that's

00:09:55.519 --> 00:10:03.679
our motive, we will thoroughly enjoy our assignments. You notice too in this verse that Paul reminded

00:10:03.679 --> 00:10:12.080
Timothy to stir up like a fire, the gift of God that was in him. No doubt you are fired up

00:10:12.639 --> 00:10:19.919
and you are ready to work hard in your assignments. But again, as explained in the study note,

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:28.320
stirring up like a fire implies continuous action, as one scholar suggests, to keep the fire

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:36.399
burning at full flame. So we are encouraged to put our heart and energy into our assignments.

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:46.399
Be fired up, but don't burn out. The fire will continue to burn at full flame if we always remember

00:10:46.399 --> 00:10:55.600
to balance work and rest. So yes, the days of our life quickly pass. It's a fact of life now,

00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:05.200
but only for now. In the new world, we will enjoy work to the full. The joy of living will get better

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:12.159
and better, especially when we're in perfect health. We will enjoy the pleasure also of consuming

00:11:12.159 --> 00:11:21.440
unpolluted food and drink. So enjoy life. Enjoy life with your family and friends. Enjoy all that

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:27.600
you have now. Enjoy your assignments. Put your heart into them. That be balanced.

00:11:28.559 --> 00:11:34.960
The simple formula from Ecclesiastes will carry on for billions and billions of years,

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:44.480
even forever. Eat and drink and find enjoyment for all your hard work, because it is the gift of

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.039
God.
