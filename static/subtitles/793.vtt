WEBVTT

00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:05.330
It is as high as the heavens.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.289
It fills the earth.

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:16.530
It is extended to a thousand generations, and it endures forever.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.289
What is it?

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:26.050
It is one of Jehovah's most beautiful qualities, his loyal love.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.809
Now what is loyal love?

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:33.070
Now one of our publications says this.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:40.189
Loyal love defies a concise definition in many languages, and I'd like to say English

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:42.270
is one of them.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.109
Trying to find a concise definition is not easy, but I'll take a stab at it.

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:54.670
The glossary of Bible terms in the New World translation says this.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:05.750
Loyal love refers to love motivated by commitment, integrity, loyalty, and deep attachment.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.469
Another reference says this.

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:16.670
It is kindness that lovingly attaches itself to persons becoming evident in continual

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.549
kind actions.

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.950
Did you get that?

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.750
Being evident in continual kind actions.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.709
But perhaps the best reference that I found was the one that said this.

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:41.670
The best way to grasp the essence of the biblical expression loyal love is by studying how God

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.349
treated his true worshipers down through the ages.

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:47.150
Isn't that true?

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.829
When we think about how Jehovah protected and fed the Israelites when they were in the

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:57.629
wilderness for 40 years, when he brought them into the promised land, he gave them judges

00:01:57.629 --> 00:02:00.150
to rescue them from their enemies.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.670
He gave them prophets to rescue them and bring them back when they got involved in false

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.549
worship.

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:16.349
And because Jehovah stuck with them in good times and in the very most difficult of times,

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.150
Jehovah could say this to the nation.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.150
Let's read it.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.590
Jeremiah, chapter 31, and verse 3.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:34.189
About midway down the verse, Jehovah says, I have loved you with an everlasting love.

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:40.189
That is why I have drawn you to me with loyal love.

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:42.270
Well that is so true.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.069
We are drawn to Jehovah because of his loyal love for us.

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.270
We can trust it.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:57.469
We can rely on it in good times and in the very most difficult of times in our lives.

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:07.189
We are always living in expectation of Jehovah's loyal love that he manifests in his continual

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:10.629
kind act toward each of us.

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.629
Brothers, don't we love Jehovah's loyal love?

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:26.180
Well, while we can never equal Jehovah in showing loyal love, the Scriptures do show that

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.259
this is a quality that we as humans must display toward others.

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:40.740
Now let's read together what it says in Proverbs, chapter 3, Proverbs, chapter 3, and verse

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.740
3.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:48.379
It says, do not let loyal love and faithfulness leave you.

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:51.060
Tie them around your neck.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.860
Write them on the tablet of your heart.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.419
So what do you learn from that?

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:02.300
We are expected by Jehovah to display loyal love.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.900
But how do we as humans display loyal love to other people?

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:17.139
Well just as Jehovah's loyal love causes him to attach himself to us with commitment and

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:25.579
loyalty, well, we want to attach ourselves, others to others, not simply with warm and

00:04:25.579 --> 00:04:37.339
fuzzy feelings, but with continual, enduring, steadfast acts of kindness that demonstrate

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:39.779
our loyal love.

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:45.819
Now why is this an important topic for all of you who are graduating today?

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:47.500
So let's consider three reasons.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.699
Here's the first.

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:55.939
You have all been recipients of loyal love from others.

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:58.699
Now how did you get here to Gilead?

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:02.779
Now I don't mean how did you get here to the auditorium this morning.

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:09.819
But how is it that you got to this point in your life that today you are graduating from

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:12.300
the Gilead school?

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.060
It's good for all of you to pause now and reflect on that question.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.779
Who were the people that loved you?

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:27.699
Who were the people that helped you so that you could be here today, graduated?

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:34.300
Who stood by you in good times and in bad times?

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:41.579
Maybe some of you think of your dear parents, some of whom might be here today in the audience.

00:05:41.579 --> 00:05:46.300
If you are, this is a happy day, right, I don't need to ask.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.500
Maybe it was the brother or sister who studied the Bible with you.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:57.180
Maybe it was the circuit overseer who encouraged you when you were young or that older sister

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:03.259
in the congregation that believed in you and encouraged you to pioneer or to put in

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:06.100
your application for Bethel.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:14.579
Well today is a day for you to look through the photo album of your heart and consider

00:06:14.579 --> 00:06:21.220
all of the people that have shown loyal love to you and have encouraged you all along the

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:29.779
way and then to be like Jehovah and show loyal love to them.

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:35.259
Maybe write them a card, send them a letter or an email.

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:39.100
Maybe a text message or a gift.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:48.180
You see some kind act to maintain that bond of loyal love between you.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.779
And how are you benefited by doing so?

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:59.220
Well among other things, it helps to keep you humble and modest, always remembering that

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:05.060
the things that you have achieved thus far and whatever you may achieve in the future

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:13.060
is not solely due to your efforts but in large part due to the loyal love that you have

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:19.860
experienced from Jehovah and from so many other loyal friends.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:26.060
And never underestimate the power of a simple act of loyal love.

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:33.220
You know one day I suddenly began to think about a couple who had helped us so much during

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.060
the court cases in Moscow.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:41.500
I decided them to just send them a brief text message just to see how they were doing

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.779
to check on them, let them know I was thinking about them.

00:07:45.779 --> 00:07:52.699
And just a few minutes later a text came back, brother Mark, we can't believe you wrote

00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:54.899
to us right now.

00:07:54.899 --> 00:08:03.019
We were both on our knees praying to Jehovah, begging him for some encouragement.

00:08:03.019 --> 00:08:09.819
And suddenly we heard ding on our phone.

00:08:09.819 --> 00:08:17.220
Prove yourselves to be like your Heavenly Father by demonstrating loyal love to all of

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:23.699
the people that have loved you and who have helped you to be sitting in these front rows

00:08:23.699 --> 00:08:27.509
of this auditorium today.

00:08:27.509 --> 00:08:34.269
Here's a second, in your assignments you brothers who are graduating are going to

00:08:34.269 --> 00:08:37.750
serve in one sense or another as overseers.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:43.789
Now always demonstrate loyal love to the brothers and sisters that you're going to oversee

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:44.909
and care for.

00:08:44.909 --> 00:08:49.549
Now that sounds like a very obvious statement doesn't it?

00:08:49.549 --> 00:08:53.350
And yet for us as humans it can be challenging.

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:56.830
Well why so?

00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:03.269
Well as we've discussed when it comes to humans loyal love involves a bond between two

00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:12.549
people and the continual kind deeds that occur between them that create this lasting bond.

00:09:12.549 --> 00:09:14.710
But now here's the challenge.

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:21.470
You see as imperfect humans we may be very quick to form a bond with people that we feel

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:28.590
a connection with, people who have similar abilities, similar talents, similar interests.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:33.190
If you work in the service department you're drawn to the circuit overseers, the missionaries,

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:39.120
the special pioneers, the desksmen, they're all wonderful.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:46.120
If you're a translator, oh you love the translators, that brother helped translate the Bible.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.600
My, right?

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:53.980
So you just love them, can't get enough of them.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:57.500
If you work in the legal department you even love the lawyers.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:04.649
Oh, sorry we all love the lawyers, sorry we love you all.

00:10:04.649 --> 00:10:07.570
And so on and so on.

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:16.129
You see, we all love those wonderful, capable people that we easily admire and look up to.

00:10:16.129 --> 00:10:18.889
But here's a question.

00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:20.970
What about all the faithful people?

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:25.490
What about all the faithful servants of Jehovah that we just don't have that immediate

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:26.809
connection with?

00:10:26.809 --> 00:10:29.730
Let me be far more clear.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:36.360
What about all the faithful people that are just plain annoying?

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:43.620
You know who you are?

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:53.750
All the won't take your phone calls.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:59.389
Well, what are we going to do with all of those people?

00:10:59.389 --> 00:11:06.029
Well we have an answer because just to be quite frank with you, the Bible is filled with

00:11:06.029 --> 00:11:09.309
annoying people.

00:11:09.309 --> 00:11:11.590
Now we all love Abraham, right?

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:13.470
We all love Abraham.

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:17.950
But now if you go to Genesis chapter 18, we're not going to read all of this, but I'm just

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:23.269
going to remind you of this account that you know well, Genesis 18.

00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:28.909
And you know, we go down here and we hear Abraham praying to Jehovah, it begins about

00:11:28.909 --> 00:11:34.669
verse 24 and Abraham begins to go into this thing with Jehovah.

00:11:34.669 --> 00:11:36.909
Jehovah, what if there's 50, see?

00:11:36.909 --> 00:11:38.750
What if there's 45?

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:40.389
What if there's 40?

00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:41.710
What if there's 30?

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:43.429
What if there's 20?

00:11:43.429 --> 00:11:44.950
What if there's 10?

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:47.629
That's annoying.

00:11:47.629 --> 00:11:51.740
That's just annoying, sorry.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:58.860
But now what did Jehovah do with that man who was a bit annoying?

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.740
He loved him.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:02.139
He loved him.

00:12:02.139 --> 00:12:05.100
He loyally stuck by him.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:11.100
And although Abraham had been dead for more than a thousand years, he continued to call

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:15.740
him Abraham, my friend.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:19.620
That's real loyal love.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:21.259
What about Peter?

00:12:21.259 --> 00:12:24.500
Peter could be very annoying.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:31.179
Now think about just one occasion, Matthew chapter 17, Matthew 17.

00:12:31.179 --> 00:12:37.899
Now here is Jesus, and it's the occasion of the transfiguration.

00:12:37.899 --> 00:12:41.340
This is a miraculous event, right?

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:48.220
So here Peter is watching, as Jesus is being transfigured, and he sees him speaking with

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:50.220
Moses and Elijah.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:51.700
What an event, right?

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:56.019
Wouldn't it be exciting to see this, this supernatural event?

00:12:56.019 --> 00:12:58.179
And what does Peter say?

00:12:58.179 --> 00:13:06.950
Hey, let's put up tents, and we can go camping.

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:09.629
That is annoying.

00:13:09.629 --> 00:13:16.100
That is annoying, but it doesn't end there.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:21.220
Of course, Peter went on to deny Jesus three times.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.740
That's annoying.

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:29.659
But what did Jesus do with that man who could be so annoying?

00:13:29.659 --> 00:13:33.139
He gave him the keys of the kingdom.

00:13:33.139 --> 00:13:37.139
He entrusted him with great responsibility.

00:13:37.139 --> 00:13:43.100
He showed true loyal love to that annoying man.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.220
So what's the point?

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:51.500
As you work as overseers and you deal with your brothers and sisters, even the annoying

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:58.580
ones, remember the principle, the simple principle that Jesus stated at Luke chapter 6.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:13:59.860
Will you read it with me?

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.139
Let's read it.

00:14:02.139 --> 00:14:09.980
Luke chapter 6 verse 32, if you love those loving you of what credit is it to you, for

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:15.019
even the sinners love those loving them, and if you do good to those doing good to

00:14:15.019 --> 00:14:22.779
you, of what credit is it to you, even the sinners do the same.

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:30.879
So demonstrate loyal love, not just to those who you feel that immediate connection with,

00:14:30.879 --> 00:14:36.860
but to all the faithful ones that you will oversee and care for, work to form a bond

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:43.019
of love even with the annoying ones.

00:14:43.019 --> 00:14:49.340
And here's the third, people in your assignments need your loyal love.

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:54.500
You see the stated purpose of Gilead is to train men and women who can strengthen and

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.139
stabilize God's people.

00:14:57.139 --> 00:14:58.860
Well now who are those people?

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.379
Who are they?

00:15:00.379 --> 00:15:08.139
They're simple, humble, faithful men and women who are just trying their best to serve

00:15:08.139 --> 00:15:09.779
Jehovah.

00:15:09.779 --> 00:15:16.580
Some are widows, some are orphans, some are elderly, others are victims of natural disasters

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.220
and calamities of every sort.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:26.500
Some are facing devastating diseases while others are imprisoned for their faith.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:35.299
All of these people need for you to loyally attach yourself to them, to reassure them of

00:15:35.379 --> 00:15:41.059
your love through your continual kind deeds.

00:15:41.059 --> 00:15:47.340
Well to do so is going to require more than just warm feelings.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.779
It's going to take your time.

00:15:49.779 --> 00:15:53.820
It's going to take your emotional energy.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:59.779
But this is what Jehovah instructs us to do at Zechariah chapter 7 and verse 9.

00:15:59.779 --> 00:16:01.620
Can you read it with me?

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:05.379
Zechariah chapter 7 and verse 9.

00:16:05.379 --> 00:16:14.980
It says, this is what Jehovah of armies says, judge with true justice and deal with one

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:20.139
another in loyal love and mercy.

00:16:20.139 --> 00:16:28.019
So Jehovah instructs us to deal with one another in loyal love, showing loyal love for your

00:16:28.019 --> 00:16:34.039
brothers and sisters who are struggling, who are suffering, will show that you really

00:16:34.039 --> 00:16:41.700
got the point of your Gilead training and that you are in your assignments to strengthen

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:48.860
and to stabilize, to loyally love and support your brothers and sisters.

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:56.139
Remember, remember, they need, they need your loyal love.

00:16:56.139 --> 00:16:58.019
So what have we learned in this discussion?

00:16:58.019 --> 00:17:04.619
Loyal love is one of the most beautiful qualities of our amazing God, Jehovah.

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:11.579
But Jehovah also expects that we are going to display loyal love to one another.

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:18.740
That we will go through the photo album of our heart and remember those who have displayed

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.420
loyal love to us.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:30.019
But we will loyally love all of those under our oversight, even the annoying ones, and

00:17:30.019 --> 00:17:37.140
that we will reach out with loyal love to those who are suffering and who most need our

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.700
kindness and attention.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:47.299
Well, if you work hard in these ways to display loyal love, what can all of you who are graduating

00:17:47.299 --> 00:17:50.180
today expect?

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:58.140
We know that you will be deeply loved by our Heavenly Father, Jehovah, but also by

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:02.619
all your brothers and sisters that you are going to serve.

00:18:02.619 --> 00:18:03.859
And how do we know this?

00:18:03.859 --> 00:18:12.740
Well, it's because of something the Bible says here in Proverbs 19 and verse 22.

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:24.099
Proverbs 19 verse 22 says, the desirable thing in a man is his loyal love.

00:18:24.099 --> 00:18:30.339
So may the blessing of Jehovah go with all of you wherever you go, and may you never

00:18:30.339 --> 00:18:35.779
forget that the desirable thing in a man is his loyal love.
