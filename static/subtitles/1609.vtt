00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:17.859
I grew up in a country where people judged you according to the colour of your skin.

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:23.859
There was black, white, mixed race, but we all kept separate.

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:33.000
I needed to learn not to see colour but to see people.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Even though it's such a multicultural area, there is still this prejudice that exists.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I've seen a witness times where ones from another country are often left isolated or are treated in a way that they're not welcome here.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
If we're not careful, these attitudes could creep into the congregation.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We could have isolated groups of cultures that maybe would stick together.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
In the area where I grew up, young ones show great respect for older ones.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.560
Older ones, however, do not give much importance to young people.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.560
This attitude or culture has a major impact on recommendations of young ones, as elders in the congregation.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.560
We might say, in my opinion, is too young to be appointed as an elder in the congregation.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.560
In this area, people sort of open up to you when you are to your age.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.560
In some areas, they would even wonder what you are doing there if you don't have the right kind of looks.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.560
In terms of what you can afford to wear, what kind of car you can afford to drive.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.560
What your profession is.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.560
If we brought that with us into the Christian congregation, then what Solomon mentions,

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.560
it could be the case that we actively seek the friendship of those that we regard to be rich and abandon those that are poor.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.560
I like the example in Galatians with Peter.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.560
He grew up in an area where there was a lot of prejudice.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.560
It wasn't something that he overcame straight away.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.560
If I'm not careful, I think it would be easy for me to slide back to see people as a different race,

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.560
and that would affect the way I view my brothers and sisters in the congregation.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.560
The article mentions that when we use the Bible, it helps us to make changes.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:34.639
We need to constantly look at ourselves so that we can continue to make progress.

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:38.639
In the article we mentioned about opening our hearts wide,

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:42.639
whether it be working with them on the ministry, having them over socially,

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:46.639
not just from the same group that we might be comfortable with,

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:50.639
but actually with different ones from different backgrounds.

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.639
Timothy was still a young man,

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:59.639
and the Apostle Paul had given him heavy responsibility in the congregation.

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:10.639
The article mentions that the Scriptures do not give an exact age for recommendation of brothers as ministerial servants or elders.

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:21.930
Recommending a younger brother as an elder in the congregation has been a great blessing to us.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:30.139
In the article, there was a little phrase that has become a guiding principle for me.

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:35.139
Jehovah does not judge our relationship with him by what we possess.

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:40.139
So when I meet new brothers and sisters, and for a moment,

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:45.139
I'm tempted to judge or view them according to those sentiments,

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:50.139
as to whether they are rich or poor, that principle comes into my mind,

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:56.139
my focus therefore shifts to who they really are in terms of their devotion to Jehovah.

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:01.139
Their faith, that is what we build friendships are.

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:05.139
I have friends from different cultures, different races,

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:10.139
and I don't see them as colour, but I see my brother and my sister.

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:15.139
I've got the most amazing friendships with ones from different backgrounds and cultures,

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.139
something I would always, always cherish.

00:04:24.829 --> 00:04:29.829
So our congregation is a wonderful place for everybody.

00:04:29.829 --> 00:04:32.829
There's no emphasis on who is rich and who is poor.

00:04:32.829 --> 00:04:39.689
Friendship I build on the basis of our love for Jehovah.
