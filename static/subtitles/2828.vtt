00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:09.699
But this is how the birth of Jesus Christ took place.

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:14.900
During the time his mother Mary was promised in marriage to Joseph.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.100
She was found to be pregnant by Holy Spirit,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:29.449
before they were united, however.

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.450
Because her husband Joseph was righteous

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.600
and did not want to make her a public spectacle,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.399
he intended to divorce her secretly,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.000
but after he had thought these things over.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.109
Look, Jehovah's Angel appeared to him in a dream.

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:26.420
Joseph, son of David,

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.239
do not be afraid to take your wife Mary home

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:36.040
for what has been conceived in her.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.780
He is by Holy Spirit,

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.180
she will give birth to a son.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.579
And you are to name him,

00:01:45.579 --> 00:02:06.140
Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.139
All of this actually came about

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:14.169
to fulfill what was spoken by Jehovah through his prophet,

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:18.379
saying, look,

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.319
the Virgin will become pregnant

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:32.370
and will give birth to a son

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.530
and they will name him Emmanuel,

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.300
which means when translated,

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:58.969
with us is God.

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:04.370
Joseph woke up from his sleep

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.169
and did as the angel of Jehovah had directed him

00:03:07.169 --> 00:04:03.050
and he took his wife home,

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:14.979
but he did not have sexual relations with her

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:19.709
until she gave birth to a son

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.709
and he named him Jesus.
