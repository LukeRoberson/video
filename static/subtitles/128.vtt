00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:04.049
I want to address the theme,

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.890
young ones, you are loved by Jehovah and his organization.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:16.929
Young ones, you are loved by Jehovah and his organization.

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:23.070
But now, when we say young ones, to whom are we referring?

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.050
As evidence of Jehovah's love,

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.010
some may immediately think of the animated series of videos

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:37.109
entitled Become Jehovah's Friend Feaching Featuring Caleb and Sophia.

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:45.810
And that has indeed been evidence of Jehovah's and the governing body's love for little children.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.609
We have gotten hundreds of letters of appreciation for this series

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:56.009
from small children and their parents and even from grandparents.

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:58.810
But what about you teenagers?

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.409
You too are still young when compared to adulthood.

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:09.569
And you are appreciated very much when you show your respect and love for Jehovah.

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:16.049
Does the Bible indicate anything about Jesus' disposition as a teenager?

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.650
There are comments about him as an infant.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.450
Also in the book of Luke, it describes Jesus as a child of 12 years old.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:37.450
Let's look at that account and determine if it also includes any comments about Jesus' attitude as a teenager.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.609
In Luke, chapter 2, verse 42,

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:49.650
it describes Jesus as a pre-teen in saying this.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.250
Luke 2, 42,

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.530
and when he was 12 years old,

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.170
they went up according to the custom of the festival.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.329
When the days of the festival were over and they were returning,

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:08.889
the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.849
And his parents did not notice it.

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:19.729
So his parents went looking for him and finally found him three days later.

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:24.770
What was Jesus focused on as a 12-year-old?

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.250
He was sitting in the temple talking with the teachers about Jehovah.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.169
Notice verse 47.

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:42.409
But all those listening to him were in constant amazement at his understanding and his answers.

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:51.569
What a good example for your children 12 years of age and younger to talk about Jehovah with confidence.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.129
But what was Jesus' attitude like as a teenager?

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:02.449
Please follow along in verses 51 and 52.

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:13.490
Then he, Jesus, went down with them and returned to Nazareth and he continued subject to them.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.650
That is to his parents.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.050
How old was he?

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.610
12.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.009
Well, what comes after 12?

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:24.210
13.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.009
Notice verse 52.

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:30.930
And Jesus went on progressing.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:43.289
You see, after 12, he went on progressing in wisdom and in physical growth and in favor with God and man.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:50.689
Evidently, then, Jesus was an intelligent well-balanced teenager.

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:54.569
But who took note of his progress as a teen?

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.849
It said God and man.

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:05.810
Yes, godly children and teenagers are appreciated by Jehovah and by spiritual men.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:12.969
Jehovah and his organization love all you young ones who are striving to do what is right.

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:18.050
But how do we know that Jehovah loves all of you?

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:23.089
Well, if you have your Bible, turn to Matthew chapter 19.

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:30.329
And here we say that Jesus showed his high regard for young ones.

00:04:30.329 --> 00:04:36.649
So Matthew chapter 19, notice verses 13 and 14.

00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:44.970
Then young children were brought to him, for him to place his hands on them and offer prayer.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.089
But the disciples reprimanded them.

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:53.089
They did not want the young ones to bother Jesus.

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:55.689
But notice verse 14.

00:04:55.689 --> 00:05:01.970
Jesus, however, said, let the young children alone.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:11.170
And do not try to stop them from coming to me for the kingdom of the heavens belongs to such ones.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.449
Yes, Jesus welcomed young ones.

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:19.970
And the Bible tells us that Jesus is the perfect reflection of Jehovah.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.490
So Jesus was imitating Jehovah's love for young ones.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.250
After many wise sayings and performing miracles,

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:36.449
Matthew chapter 21 describes Jesus riding into Jerusalem as Jehovah's anointed one.

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:42.769
Please notice the difference between some of the adult's reactions and that of appreciative young ones.

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:49.569
Matthew 21 and verse 15 tells us this.

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:56.009
When the chief priest and the scribe saw the marvelous things he did

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:02.329
and the boys who were shouting in the temple, save we pray the son of David.

00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:05.410
They became indignant.

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.529
Who was boldly praising Jesus?

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:14.129
The scripture said that the boys were shouting out praise.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:21.889
What a contrast those young ones were to the religious leaders who were irritated by all of this.

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:29.050
Young people, when you speak up about Jehovah and Jesus, they both take notice of you.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.209
They are proud of your stand for the truth.

00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:38.850
But how do you know that the governing body and the organization loves you?

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:45.569
Well, they have published many books and magazine articles specifically for young ones.

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:49.050
In addition to all of the printed material,

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:54.129
there are the become Jehovah's friend videos for children.

00:06:54.129 --> 00:07:04.050
But you teenagers, have you been keeping up with all of the information specifically for you on jw.org?

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:12.889
There are dozens of printed articles on an array of subjects that interest those of your age.

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:24.720
In so many ways, Jehovah and his organization show their love and appreciation for all you dear young ones.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.959
What can you young ones do in return?

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:32.560
You may say, I go to all the meetings and out in service.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.639
Well, that is wonderful.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:41.000
Some of you may have even joined the Theocratic ministry school already,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.199
and you help clean and maintain the kingdom hall.

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:49.199
We warmly commend you for your good works.

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:56.800
But if you think about it, even more important is having a good personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.879
In Luke chapter 10, verse 27, it says,

00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:15.120
You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole strength and with your whole mind.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:22.720
To love Jehovah with your whole heart means that you have a good personal relationship with him.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.879
That involves more than just doing good things.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:32.039
It involves praying to him about what is in your heart.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:37.480
Tell him everything you love and whatever you fear.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:41.519
You can tell Jehovah very personal things.

00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:44.679
He is not going to tell anyone else.

00:08:44.679 --> 00:08:52.559
But he can give you the strength and wisdom to handle matters for the best possible outcome.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:58.840
Set up your own personal Bible study program in addition to family worship evening.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:07.480
This is how Jehovah communicates back to you and your relationship with him will be strengthened.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:12.879
You are the next generation of adults in Jehovah's organization.

00:09:12.879 --> 00:09:20.080
We continue to need spiritually qualified ones to get Jehovah's work done.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:30.039
A good relationship with Jehovah as a youth sets you up for the best way of life as a responsible adult.

00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:38.399
Along the way though, you will face pressure from Satan's system that can test your faith.

00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:46.080
But by loving Jehovah with your whole heart, you can get through any test you may encounter.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.480
And I mean any test that you may encounter.
