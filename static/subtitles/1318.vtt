WEBVTT

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:10.820
Since we come from a variety of different backgrounds, the organization is making a great effort to provide spiritual food and as many languages as possible.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.820
So that in spite of our differences, we can all be one united family.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:26.820
Our brothers and sisters, as speak Navajo, a Native American language, experience that unity, especially in October of last year.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.820
That was the first time an assembly was held in their mother tongue.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:43.109
The Navajo Nation is the largest reservation in the U.S.

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:46.109
It's made up of 27,000 square miles.

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:51.109
The reservation itself is bigger than 10 of the states in the U.S.

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:56.109
And also there's almost 300,000 members of the Navajo tribe.

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:02.109
When it comes to the language and the reservation, some people think that the language is a dying language

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:05.109
and that nobody speaks their native tongue anymore.

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:11.109
But really that's a myth because Navajo is spoken by everyone, young and old alike.

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:13.109
In fact, they teach it in school.

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:18.620
The Navajo people are very receptive to learning the truth.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.620
We could see though that there's something missing.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.620
We had excellent teaching in our meetings.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.620
We had wonderful pioneers, need graders that moved out, working the area.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.620
But something was missing.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:36.620
And it took us a while to realize we needed to talk to people in their language.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:43.620
We automatically assume because they speak English, we can talk to them about how are you doing their day-to-day life,

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.620
that they're getting everything, but they're not.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:53.620
When we started using Navajo in the meetings and using our Navajo Bible and choking it out like we can even do it well,

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.620
it had more impact on the friends and the most eloquent English talks we could give.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.620
To acknowledge the first Navajo baptize was in the 1950s. It was a sister.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:13.620
It wasn't until the 90s where more effort was put forth to bring in more of the witnesses and to the reservation.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:21.620
In 2011, the governing body gave directions to establish a remote translation office in Chinley, Arizona.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.620
In March 2013, the first Navajo congregation was established.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:33.620
And from that point on, we now have three additional congregations that have been formed.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.620
And we have seven groups.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.620
The last few years, we've assigned a number of special pioneers.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.620
There are 12 of them now.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.620
And two missionaries, to the reservation, to spread the good news to the Navajo people.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.620
And they were directed to learn the language.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:06.620
We usually, my wife and I get up early and we'll either listen to the Navajo Bible or we'll listen to a brochure on JW.org in the Navajo language.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.620
And that really gets us prepared for speaking the language and reading the language to our neighbors.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.620
In our congregation, we have 48 Bible studies and 150% meeting attendance.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.620
With many Bible students attending meetings on a regular basis, they're going to assemblies and conventions.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.620
Currently, we're helping a family of eight learn more about the Bible and their progressing well.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.620
One of their relatives told them, you're losing your culture and you're learning a white man's religion.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.620
And the young daughter spoke up and said, we're not losing our culture.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.620
At the meetings, we're learning to write, read and speak Navajo.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.620
And we use the Navajo Bible at all of our meetings and we love it.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:04:22.319
And so what a joy it is to help people to make changes in their lives and they have a happier, fuller life because of what they're learning.

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:26.319
October 25th, 2014 was a very special day.

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:34.319
One that'll long be remembered because it was the first time Jehovah's Witnesses had an assembly all in the Navajo language.

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:39.319
To see the great increases taking place.

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:47.319
And then to be at that special occasion, when they all came together at one time, was just somewhat overwhelming.

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:51.319
I was smiling dear to year the whole time.

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:57.319
When I got on the stage, I had to be very careful because it was such an emotional time for me.

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:09.319
And to see the old ones that had struggled for years and years to help the work get off the ground in the Navajo field was very, very touching and heartwarming.

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:14.920
It really is an experience I will never forget in my life.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.920
And so many different tribes also came that spoke their native tongues.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:28.920
In fact, we had 26 total Native American tribes and they came from three countries, Canada, US and Mexico.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:35.920
And many of them drove hours. We heard of one group that drove 22 hours in order to attend this special occasion.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:41.920
Being here with the brothers and just an interchange of encouragement makes it really special for me.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:48.920
It's so encouraging to be with other people that are learning or know Navajo and see him get to know Jehovah more.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:55.920
I almost cried when I heard the first talk, when it was over, it was just beautiful. It's wonderful.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:02.920
You get to see what Jehovah's Holy Spirit when it directs you in the right place, what it can accomplish.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.920
All I could say to Jehovah is thank you, Jehovah, for letting me be here.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:14.920
I feel so happy how much Jehovah has taken an interest in all his people, but today the native people.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:37.920
This is the first time these Navajo brothers and sisters were able to hear the entire program in their own language

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.920
and to hear the Bible read in their language.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:49.920
They've struggled for many years in the reservation and just off the reservation because they had to attend English meetings.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:58.920
And they did wonderful Jehovah bless their beautiful efforts. And at this assembly, it was a paraded touch their hearts.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:04.920
But the first time ever in my life, I didn't have to translate from English.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:12.920
And to be able to hear it, it goes straight here. It doesn't stop here, it goes here.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.920
I think the most exciting to me was looking at Psalm 68.4.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:44.920
I appreciate our Navajo friends so much because they stuck with Jehovah all that time, even though they weren't understanding everything.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:53.920
To form a love for Jehovah without a full understanding, that's an amazing thing. Our Navajo friends have been building a strong faith on crumbs.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:08:03.920
And now they're getting fed spiritually. The good news brochure, the Jehovah's Wheel brochure, this is the richest spiritual food the Navajo friends have ever had in their life.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:09.920
They've sat through every watchtower study, but they're hearing something in their language that's touching them.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:18.920
I always imagined a new system, entered A, I saw it, and so it's really special, very special.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:27.920
I see this as a small step. And Jehovah's organization soon, we're going to all learn one language, and that language is left.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:36.919
I feel like Jehovah reads out and hugged the Navajo people. That's what it was like. He embraced them and said, I love you.

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:49.919
We pray Jehovah's continued blessing upon all the effort that's being put into preaching the good news to people, and all nations, tribes, and tongues, including the Navajo feel.
