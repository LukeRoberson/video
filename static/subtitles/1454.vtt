00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.040
Today, over 600 witnesses worldwide are imprisoned

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.039
for remaining neutral in world affairs.

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:13.039
Join us as we visit the legal department

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:15.039
at World Headquarters.

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:19.039
They work tirelessly to help our brothers legally

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.039
and to protect our rights to publicly witness to others.

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.460
Please watch.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.460
In carrying out the responsibility to do God's will,

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.740
Jehovah's Witnesses have met with legal challenges.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:46.740
These challenges have been many and at times severe.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.340
There's no time to lose.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.340
We need to get our surgery right away.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.340
And we need to prepare for blood transfer.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.340
This has led to the establishment of a legal department

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.340
which is located at the Watchtower Educational Center

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.340
in Patterson, New York.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.340
Under the direction of the governing body

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.340
and the United States Branch Committee,

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.340
the legal department works to protect our legal rights to worship.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.340
When restrictions are placed on our activities,

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.340
we work to defend and legally establish the good news.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.840
Let's examine a case that was taken all the way

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.840
to the United States Supreme Court.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.840
The town of Straton, Ohio passed an ordinance

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.840
requiring anyone wanting to engage in door to door activity

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.840
to obtain a permit from the mayor.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.840
The ordinances that were enacted were specifically designed

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.840
to restrict the activity of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.840
The witnesses tried to work the matter out

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.840
with the municipality, with the village,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.840
but the village was insistent

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.840
our brothers and sisters obtained permits

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.840
prior to going from door to door.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.840
This permit scheme was appelled in the lower courts in Ohio.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.840
Thus, the case was appealed to the United States Supreme Court.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.250
The Supreme Court ruled in our favor

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.250
and held that such ordinances are unconstitutional

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.250
as applied to the public ministry of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.250
Even now, we still have some municipalities

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.250
that would like to enforce their permit regulation

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.250
against our brothers and sisters.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.250
We turn their attention to the Straton decision

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.250
and the issue is resolved.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.250
Since 1919, Jehovah's Witnesses have obtained 50 victories

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.250
before the United States Supreme Court.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.169
Just as extraordinary, we have prevailed

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:46.169
in the European Court of Human Rights over 50 times.

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:49.169
Jehovah's Witnesses do not seek confrontation.

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:53.169
They prefer to quietly serve God.

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:59.169
But when events unfold that force them to stand up

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:03.169
and say, I won't do this or I have to do that

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:07.169
because my faith compiles me to do so.

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:13.169
It is remarkable to see the steel-like determination

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:17.169
of these individuals who have looked in the eyes of judges,

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:21.169
magistrates, police officers, and have simply said,

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:23.169
I have to obey God.

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:26.169
What part can you play in defending

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:29.169
and legally establishing the good news?

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:32.169
You can stay informed of legal developments

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:35.169
by means of reports provided by the faithful

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:37.169
and discreet slave.

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:40.169
You can ask Jehovah in prayer to give your brothers

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.169
and sisters the power beyond what is normal

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:45.639
and for his will to be done.

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:49.639
Also, you can faithfully maintain your integrity

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:52.639
to Jehovah even when facing opposition.

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:55.639
And thank you again for respecting my wishes.

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:56.639
You're very welcome.

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.639
How grateful we are to Jehovah

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:01.639
who has granted his people the legal victories needed

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:04.639
to freely carry out our worship.

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:06.639
I know you have your ministry,

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.639
but when people call...

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.639
It is the legal department's privilege

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:12.639
to work shoulder to shoulder with you

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:16.639
in defending and legally establishing the good news.
