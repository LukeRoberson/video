00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.429
How does a camel survive in this harsh environment?

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:13.220
Jehovah has uniquely equipped a camel for desert life.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:19.320
What is inside the camel's famous hump?

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.320
It's mostly fat.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.460
A healthy camel's hump can weigh 36 kilograms or 80 pounds.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.600
It can draw on this fat reserve when food is limited.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.039
When given an opportunity, a thirsty camel can drink up to 95 liters

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:43.659
or 25 gallons of water in just a few minutes.

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:49.700
Yet their bodies lose little moisture, even in extreme heat.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:56.469
As a result, they can go weeks or even months without drinking water.

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:01.310
The camel's impressive ability to absorb and conserve nourishment and water

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:10.129
enables it to endure.

00:01:10.129 --> 00:01:17.750
High in the mountains of North America, living conditions are unfavorable for most plants.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.829
Yet the bristle cone pine not only survives, but can thrive at some 3,000 meters

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:27.950
or 10,000 feet above sea level.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.060
These remarkable trees can live for thousands of years.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.900
One key to their survival lies in their roots.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:47.540
Shallow branching roots spread out and gather up as much water as possible.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:55.510
Large, strong roots firmly anchor the trees against intense winds.

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:04.780
These remarkable trees are designed to make the most of a challenging environment.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:20.289
As a result, they are among the oldest living organisms on the planet.

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:25.050
Butterflies play a vital role in pollinating flowers.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.099
They also accomplish amazing feats of endurance.

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.939
Each year in North America, as many as 300 million monarch butterflies

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:38.180
complete a migration of some 4,000 kilometers

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:46.409
or 2,500 miles from as far north as Canada to a forest in Mexico.

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:51.229
Butterflies are also surprisingly resilient.

00:02:51.229 --> 00:03:00.870
Some butterflies have been observed feeding and flying with up to 70% of their wing surfaces missing.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.189
Butterflies may appear to be delicate and fragile.

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:21.639
But these small creatures display remarkable endurance.

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:27.680
As its name suggests, most Arctic turns breed in the Earth's far northern regions

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:35.199
where they take advantage of the short Arctic summer to feed and raise chicks.

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:39.199
But as winter approaches, they fly south to the Antarctic region

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:45.900
where they greet the arrival of summer in the southern hemisphere.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.900
When summer ends, they return to the Arctic,

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:55.340
completing the longest known annual migration of any animal.

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.379
What guides the Arctic turn to reach its destination?

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:04.259
Scientists believe that the Arctic turns can sense the Earth's magnetic field

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:06.219
and use it for orientation.

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:09.780
But how they do this still remains a mystery.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.699
Jehovah has given the Arctic turn an accurate means of guidance

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:23.129
to complete its long journey.

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:27.850
The blacksmith lap wing or plover is found in Africa.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.870
It nests on the ground, often near water.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:39.589
Its choice of nest location can bring it in contact with much larger animals.

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:47.009
When its nest is threatened, the lap wings sounds the alarm.

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:52.610
Sometimes the lap wing will attempt to draw an intruder away from its nest.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.889
At other times, the bird will courageously stand its ground,

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.970
spreading its wings and crying harshly.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.810
Lap wings have been known to attack humans and square off against elephants and buffalo.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:13.709
At times, giving the larger animal a sharp strike with its beak.

00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:18.149
Jehovah gave the lap wing the instinctive courage to protect its young,

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:26.399
enabling it to survive.

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:31.819
Very little rain falls in the arid wilderness of Sinai.

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:38.139
One of the few types of trees to grow here is the Acacia.

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:45.100
The wood of the Acacia tree is dense, hard, and resistant to insects.

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:53.610
Some types of Acacia trees are protected by thick bark and long, sharp thorns.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.250
Acacia trees often grow closely together.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.449
The branches of some Acacia's interlock together forming dense canopies.

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:06.730
Other Acacia's grow entangled thickets.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:11.329
These natural defenses help the Acacia tree to endure.
