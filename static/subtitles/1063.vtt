00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:11.300
For almost 40 years, Moses enjoyed a life of comfort and privilege as the adopted son of Pharaoh's daughter.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:21.300
Among the advantages, material prosperity, and advanced education, how might those advantages

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.300
have affected Moses' outlook?

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.300
We gained some insight from an incident that took place when Moses was 80 years of age.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.299
It's recorded in Exodus chapter 5.

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:39.299
There in a conversation with the Pharaoh, the Pharaoh is reported to have said to Moses,

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:42.299
who is Jehovah that I should obey his voice?

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:45.299
I do not know Jehovah at all.

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:48.299
No truer words have ever been spoken.

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:54.299
That Pharaoh did not know Jehovah, and as a result had no faith in him.

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:57.299
He was faithless.

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:02.299
His hearty words, dismissive of Jehovah,

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:08.299
no doubt reflected the Egyptian belief that the Pharaoh was himself a God.

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:16.299
Was Moses' outlook affected in a negative way by that Egyptian culture?

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:17.299
No.

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.299
We see a refreshing contrast.

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.299
Moses was a humble man, a man of faith,

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.299
who at the age of 40 made a decision that reflected the depth of that faith

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.299
and that changed his life forever.

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.299
Why should you and I be interested in Moses' example of faith?

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:51.299
Because like Moses, we face situations that require choices, decisions that reflect the quality of our faith.

00:01:51.299 --> 00:02:11.500
For example, note how an elder faces a test of his faith in the following dramatization.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.500
Danny is going to look after the business while we're away.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.069
I only scheduled a few small jobs.

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:31.009
I'm sure he can handle it.

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:36.009
It's our sign convention, and I planned as best I could for us to go together.

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:44.500
But some things, you just can't see coming.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.500
Hello?

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.500
Danny was in a panic.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.500
He got trouble calls from my two biggest accounts.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.599
It was bad.

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:05.000
I can't lose their business.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
For just a few minutes, let's consider what the scriptures have to say about Moses' faith

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and consider four ways that we can imitate him.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.409
Turn please to Hebrews chapter 11.

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:23.409
And we're going to begin reading in verse 24.

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.409
Hebrews 11, 24.

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:34.409
By faith, Moses, when grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:43.409
choosing to be mistreated with the people of God, rather than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin.

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:52.409
So the first thing that Moses did, he rejected the proud selfish thinking of that Egyptian world.

00:03:52.409 --> 00:04:04.409
He chose to be mistreated with the Israelites, who were slaves, rather than to align himself with a culture that dismissed Jehovah.

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:08.819
What prompted that decision?

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:15.819
The opening words of verse 24 tell us Moses was a man of faith.

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:24.819
And his faith shaped his decisions, not his culture, not community pressure, his faith.

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:26.819
And that's our second point.

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:31.220
Now let's continue reading in verse 26.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:38.220
Because he considered the reproach of the Christ to be riches greater than the treasures of Egypt.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:45.220
For he looked intently toward the payment of the reward.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:52.220
Moses received an assignment, a commission from Jehovah.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:59.220
And he viewed that commission as more valuable than anything that Egypt had to offer.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:09.220
He turned his back on the comforts of Egypt and aligned himself with Jehovah and the outworking of Jehovah's purpose.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.220
Our third point?

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.220
He had clear spiritual vision.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.220
He looked intently toward the payment of the reward.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:28.220
Moses could see outside the Egypt box, and he could see the fulfillment of Jehovah's wonderful promises to Abraham and Abraham's descendants.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:35.220
The spiritual vision is committed on further in verse 27.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.220
By faith, he left Egypt, but not fearing the anger of the king.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:47.220
For he continued steadfast as seahine, the one who was invisible.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:55.220
Yes, Moses could see the Pharaoh, but with his clear spiritual vision, he could see Jehovah.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.220
Moses had an unbreakable friendship with Jehovah.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.220
So can you.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:10.220
The quality of any friendship can be measured by the quality of communication that characterizes it.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:21.220
Regular heartfelt prayer and meaningful study of the Bible constitute two-way communication between an individual and Jehovah.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:29.220
As we get to know Jehovah better and better, as our faith strengthens and deepens.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:34.220
Then our decisions reflect that faith.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:41.220
And in our words and actions, we give evidence of that faith.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.220
And that brings us to the fourth point.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:53.220
In the opening words of verse 27, by faith, Moses left Egypt.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:07:00.220
His faith was of such quality that it evidenced in his words and his actions.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.220
True, Moses was a man of action.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.220
He left Egypt.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.220
But he was also a man who expressed his convictions.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:17.220
When Moses and the Israelites stood on the shore of the Red Sea, with Pharaoh and his armies behind them,

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:26.220
and the Red Sea in front of them, and seemingly nowhere to go, how did Moses strengthen the people?

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.220
Do not be afraid.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:34.470
Stand still and see the salvation of Jehovah.

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:38.470
Those words must have strengthened the Israelites.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:47.470
In a similar way, we can strengthen those around us, whether in the preaching work in our dealings with our family or with others,

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:55.470
when our faith is voiced and evidenced in the things that we say and do.

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:59.470
We're a blessing to those around us.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:07.470
Of course, it's important that we stay humble, as Moses did, ever receptive to Jehovah's direction and counsel

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:12.470
that he provides through his word and his organization.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:16.470
Now, how about that elder who we met earlier?

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:25.620
Let's look in and see how he imitates Moses in making a decision.

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:33.279
Okay, just find the parts, and I'll call you back. This will take our weekend.

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:37.279
You want us to go? Will you get the program later?

00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:41.279
Yeah, and I'll have to text John that I can't be an attendant.

00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:43.279
But what will I miss that I can't get later?

00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:46.820
Hey, welcome, author.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:59.899
In Hebrew's 11 verse 26 it says,

00:08:59.899 --> 00:09:07.899
Moses considered the reproach of the Christ to be riches greater than the treasures of Egypt.

00:09:07.899 --> 00:09:12.899
For he looked intently toward the payment of the reward.

00:09:12.899 --> 00:09:20.330
Of what value is being a prince of Egypt compared with me?

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:31.870
Honey, what do you think?

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:35.870
Nanny? Yeah, here's what I want you to do for now.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:43.509
And we'll pick up the pieces when I get back.

00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:49.509
Did you notice how the elder made a decision based on his faith?

00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:55.509
With his eyes of faith, he could see the blessings that he and his family would enjoy.

00:09:55.509 --> 00:10:03.509
If they attended the convention together and he made a decision as a spiritual man.

00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:09.509
In a similar way, if we imitate Moses rejecting the proud selfish thinking of the world

00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:17.509
and allowing our decisions to be shaped by our faith, not by culture or community pressure.

00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:24.509
If we maintain clear spiritual vision and if our faith is evidenced in our words and actions,

00:10:24.509 --> 00:10:35.509
then we can be confident of Jehovah's support and his hand of salvation in our behalf just as he did for Moses.

00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:42.509
Brother Robert Soranco, a helper to the writing committee, will consider the final talk of this symposium.

00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:46.509
imitate the faithful, not the faithless.

00:10:46.509 --> 00:10:50.509
Jesus disciples, not the Pharisees.
