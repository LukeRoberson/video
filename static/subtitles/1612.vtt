00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:20.989
Our goal as teachers is to help the person to become a disciple of Christ.

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:27.429
I want my student to love Jehovah the same way that I do.

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.429
What I most enjoy is conducting Bible studies.

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:36.429
Being able to see a student grow spiritually is a joy that can't be put into words.

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:44.429
The Watch Tower of January 2020 mentions several things that we need to keep in mind as we conduct a study.

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:50.429
Studying the article I saw how many changes I needed to make when I conduct a Bible study.

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:53.429
It highlighted that besides helping the student to gain knowledge,

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:58.429
it's even more important that we help them progress to the point of dedicating their lives to Jehovah

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.429
and of course getting baptized.

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:05.430
Even though I read about how we should stop studying with non-progressive Bible studies,

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.430
I didn't feel comfortable doing it because I was afraid I might make the wrong decision.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.430
Although I was pretty sure that my Bible student wasn't yet married, that is legally married,

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.430
she had never told me this directly.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.430
And I just didn't feel comfortable talking with her about it.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.430
I had a Bible student who always prepared for and commented well at the study.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.430
I kept inviting her to the meeting, but she never went to a single one.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.430
And she never attended the memorial.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.430
I saw that she still had ties with some aspects of her religion.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:50.250
The article brought out that in the first few weeks, as soon as the study becomes regular,

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.250
it's important to start praying with the student.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.250
It used to take me a long time to start doing that.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.250
The article helped me because it encouraged me to bring others with me on the study

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.250
and also not to be afraid to bring along those who were more experienced.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.250
In the article, it was brought out how important it is not just for us to pray with our students,

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.250
but also to help them to begin saying their own prayers as well.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.250
After that, when the study became regular, I prayed before and after each session.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.250
And I encouraged each of them to also begin praying to Jehovah personally,

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.250
so praying became a daily habit for them.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.250
A circuit over a seer's wife went with me on the study,

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.250
and she asked my student if she was married.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.250
Yes, I'm married. What are you legally married?

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.250
And then she responded, no.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:55.250
So that really opened up an opportunity for me to help the student out with the situation.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.250
The article gave some suggestions about how we need to pay attention to the student's spiritual progress.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.250
It really should be consistent.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.250
We studied for a long time, a little over a year,

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.250
and that's when I realized that it was time for me to stop and decide if I should discontinue the study.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.250
Then I put into practice the suggestion from the Watchtower of January 2020.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.250
I told her, you're really a someone who appreciates God's word,

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.250
and you're always regular with your studies.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.250
But like we just read about, there's some footage in your life that's missing.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.250
But she responded, but I think it's all in Jehovah's time.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.250
So I said, Jehovah has already invited you personally,

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.250
so it's really up to you now.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.250
But she kept saying, well to me, it'll happen in Jehovah's time.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.250
Unfortunately, it seemed better to discontinue the study,

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.250
because she showed that she didn't feel the need to make progress.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.250
This article was a present from Jehovah.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.250
It was like everything that was important came all together in just one article.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.250
We're living in urgent times, so we need to be as efficient as possible.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.250
The spiritual progress a person makes, which may have taken five years, can take place now.
