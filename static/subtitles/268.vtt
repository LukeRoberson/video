00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:09.929
That was my best friend, Lucas, when we were kids, and that was me, Oscar.

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.490
We knew exactly what we wanted to do when we grew up.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.170
Pioneer, go to Bethel, build Kingdom Halls.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:31.609
We kept those goals, and when graduation came, we were ready.

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.530
Our little business needed just a few more accounts.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.240
Then we'd have enough for us and to help our families.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:47.259
Finally, day one for this service year.

00:00:47.259 --> 00:01:12.930
And two new pioneers, where we live, finding spiritual interest is tough.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.209
We really have cleaners.

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:19.260
And finding enough work was harder than we thought.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.180
A few months in, I was sure Jehovah would help if we just stuck it out.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.459
Sorry, Oscar, I can't make it today.

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:28.700
Something came up.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.659
Lucas.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.900
What came up was an opportunity for more money.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.430
But at what cost?

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.269
You quitting or what?

00:01:45.269 --> 00:01:46.670
Nah.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.989
I'm not quitting.

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:52.569
Pioneering, or a business.

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:54.930
Neither, but you know the struggle here.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.650
Most brothers can afford to pioneer for a year, two tops.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.969
Look, it's not full-time while I'm training.

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:38.300
It's a backup plug.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:46.550
So Lucas stopped pioneering?

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.310
Maybe he's right.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.430
He's just being practical.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.539
I mean, is it wrong to quit if you think it's not working?

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:07.740
I struggled with the same question when I pioneered.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.060
Whatever you decide, if you can tell Jehovah your reason,

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.259
with a clean conscience, then it's the right decision for you.

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:26.789
Why would I keep going when it's so difficult?

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:29.789
Since all these things are to be dissolved in this way,

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:32.229
consider what sorts of people you ought to be

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:35.870
in holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:55.330
Here he is, the last days.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.889
And people need the good news.

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:02.930
And they'll only hear it if we keep up our deeds

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.129
of godly devotion as best we can.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.389
I prayed to endure and only stop pioneering

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:17.870
if my circumstances left no other choice.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.870
And I prayed to see the blessings.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:32.660
And after a while, I learned that a little perseverance

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:44.660
with Jehovah's spirit can be contagious.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.300
So what do you want to do when you go up?

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.779
Pioneer.

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:50.740
And go to Bethel?

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:51.339
Yep.

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:53.139
And then maybe build Kingdom Halls.

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:53.660
You in?

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.500
Here.
