00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:30.230
Since 1953, young brothers in Korea have been imprisoned for refusing military service.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.590
More than 19,000 brothers have spent a total of 36,000 years in prison for refusing to

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.630
compromise their faith.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:45.469
However, on February 28, 2019, the last of our imprisoned brothers was released.

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:51.350
For the first time in 66 years, not one of Jehovah's Witnesses is imprisoned for refusing military

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.189
service.

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:58.789
Brothers and sisters around the world rejoiced at this historic legal victory.

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.590
But how was this possible?

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.230
It was Jehovah's powerful hand at work.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:14.019
He blessed the young brothers and their families for the faith and courage they showed.

00:01:14.019 --> 00:01:19.659
His Holy Spirit strengthened them, and he provided them with support and encouragement

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.900
through a globally united brotherhood.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:32.560
Now, let's take a closer look at the record of unwavering faith and courage among the Korean brothers.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.239
When the Korean War broke out in 1950, the issue of conscientious objection to military service

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:39.840
came to the fore.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.280
Brother Jung Il Park was one of the first of Jehovah's Witnesses to refuse to compromise his faith.

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:53.280
In 1953, before the war was over, I received an enlistment notice.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.519
At the Recruitment Center, I explained that my sincere conscience would not allow me to

00:01:58.519 --> 00:02:00.799
join the military.

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:07.840
They took me to a counterintelligent facility where I was interrogated and tortured.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.159
Once I realized the sincerity of my religious convictions, I was transferred to the military

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:20.199
police, where a military tribunal gave me a three-year prison sentence.

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:25.560
Even after the armistice in 1953, the Korean government continued to punish conscientious

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.680
objectors.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.199
In 1973, under the President's special order to achieve 100% enlistment, authorities

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:40.840
raided kingdom halls and the private homes of brothers to forcefully enlist them.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.599
When the officials raided the kingdom hall, I was giving a public talk in the podium.

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.599
After the meeting, I said goodbye to my family and fellow witnesses and told them I would

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.759
see them in paradise.

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:56.099
Then I was taken away to the military base.

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.120
The brothers who were forcefully taken with me were beaten mercilessly and suffered

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.400
all kinds of abuse.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.039
As time passed, the inhumane treatment of our brothers enlisted against their will became

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:10.000
even more severe.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:18.080
Between 1975 and 1985, five brothers died due to physical abuse.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.199
The government formally admitted responsibility for this tragedy.

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:26.280
Brother Chun-gil Lee was one of the five brothers.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.039
Brother Chun-gil Lee was such a precious son to his mother.

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:33.639
At a young age, he had to be the head of his family.

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:38.280
According to the records later found by the commission on suspicious deaths, Brother Lee

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.800
had been hit in the stomach with a rod until he lost consciousness.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.460
The officer thought he was pretending and continued to beat him.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.680
After realizing how bad he was hurt, the officer tried to revive Brother Lee by splashing

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.560
water on him, but he never woke up.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.120
Brother Chun-gil Lee also suffered similar hardships back then.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.120
What helped you to endure?

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:11.039
The year-tax that year was Psalm 91-2, Jehovah is my refuge and my stronghold.

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:16.120
It felt as if it had been chosen especially for us Korean brothers.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.519
Our families were suffering as well.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.560
They had no visitation rights and were denied all contact with us, so they didn't know

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.360
whether we were dead or alive.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.480
All they could do was calm their anxious hearts and look to Jehovah who reassured them

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.199
with the promise.

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:37.000
I will be your refuge and your stronghold.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.459
This was a great comfort to them.

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:48.259
At that time, if we refused to enlist in the army, some of us were imprisoned multiple

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:49.579
times.

00:04:49.579 --> 00:04:57.019
In my case, I was imprisoned in 1972 and again in 1975.

00:04:57.019 --> 00:05:02.939
Just the thought of having to return to the same prison was emotionally devastating.

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:08.180
While in prison the second time, I received a letter from brother Albert Schroeder who

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.019
was a member of the governing body at the time.

00:05:12.019 --> 00:05:16.339
I read the letter with all the brothers who were imprisoned with me.

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:22.019
In it, he warmly encouraged us by telling us that the governing body and all of the brothers

00:05:22.019 --> 00:05:26.699
around the world were praying for us.

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:32.540
After reading this stirring letter, our faith in Jehovah grew stronger.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:38.220
Not only were we reassured that we were not alone, but we also gained greater strength

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.620
and courage to defend our faith.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:48.379
During this time, it was difficult to get a fair hearing in court.

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:53.060
In 1982, we were tried in a military tribunal.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:59.139
The military policeman guarding us threatened us not to make a defense for ourselves.

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:04.379
On the day of the trial, even the judicial officer in charge of our defense said,

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:08.300
it's cold, so please go easy on them.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.060
That was it.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.259
At the time, the longest legal prison sentence was two years.

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:22.180
Yet we received a three-year sentence without having a proper hearing or even an explanation

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.259
as to why it was long.

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:29.300
Did the situation improve for the brothers over time?

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.379
When I was charged with the maximum sentence of two years for insubordination and a military

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:38.699
tribunal, there was no way for me to make a defense for myself.

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:44.139
Sadly, the situation hadn't changed at all when my oldest son was tried in court years

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:47.139
later.

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:51.939
I was sentenced in a military tribunal in the year 2000.

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:56.620
In fact, I was told that if I tried to make a defense during the trial, I would face retaliation

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.420
afterwards.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.300
At that time, many brothers were sentenced to three years in prison.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.500
This was even longer than my father's prison sentence.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.899
However, there was a change.

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:13.779
The brothers had been tried in military tribunals for decades, but in 2001, the cases were

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:16.100
moved to civilian courts.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:20.100
I refused to enlist in November 2001, and so I was arrested.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:24.579
I wanted to defend Jehovah's name and my stance on Christian neutrality in court, so

00:07:24.579 --> 00:07:26.379
I requested bail.

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:28.899
Surprisingly, my request was granted.

00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:33.660
It was the first time anyone was released on bail under the military service act.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:38.259
As I walked out of the jail cell, I realized that Jehovah had opened the door for us to

00:07:38.259 --> 00:07:40.139
fight this legal battle.

00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:45.939
In court, we felt the fulfillment of Jesus' promise to his disciples in Matthew 10, what

00:07:45.939 --> 00:07:49.259
you are to speak will be given you in that hour.

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:52.699
I claimed my innocence in the courts for two years.

00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:56.779
Although I received the guilty decision in the initial and appeal trials, I appealed to

00:07:56.779 --> 00:07:58.420
the Supreme Court.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.620
Unfortunately, my case was dismissed and I was imprisoned once again.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.620
But while I was in prison, another door opened.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:10.019
With the help of our brothers and human rights groups, I filed a complaint with the UN Human

00:08:10.019 --> 00:08:13.939
Rights Committee to raise awareness in the international community.

00:08:13.939 --> 00:08:20.180
In 2006, the UN Human Rights Committee declared that imprisoning conscientious objectors

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:26.220
was a violation of human rights, and it firmly stated that the South Korean government

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:31.339
is obligated to compensate the complainant, Brother Yabum Yun.

00:08:31.339 --> 00:08:36.100
During this time, the governing body arranged for the brothers at the Korea branch to work

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.779
with the World Headquarters Legal Department.

00:08:39.779 --> 00:08:47.649
This was an important turning point in the legal fight for the Korean brothers.

00:08:47.649 --> 00:08:53.370
Andre and I felt so privileged when we arrived to deliver letters from the governing body

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:56.129
to our dear brothers in prison in Korea.

00:08:56.129 --> 00:08:58.649
At that time, there were almost a thousand of them.

00:08:58.649 --> 00:09:06.730
There was about 150 young brothers facing trial, so a legal package was compiled so that

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:10.649
the elders could prepare the young brothers for their trial.

00:09:10.649 --> 00:09:15.970
You remember, Philip, the meetings with the 10,000 elders?

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:22.330
They were just excited at the prospect of this new strategy.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.169
I was very fortunate.

00:09:24.169 --> 00:09:30.730
Unlike my father, I had the opportunity to clearly state my case in court.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:36.409
The elders in my congregation helped me to go over the legal packet, provided by the branch,

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:40.769
and a lot of other materials to prepare me for the trial.

00:09:40.769 --> 00:09:47.169
Thanks to their help, I no longer felt afraid, and I was eager for the trial to start, so

00:09:47.169 --> 00:09:51.850
that I could courageously and boldly convey my faith.

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:56.929
Although I ended up serving time in prison, I received hundreds of letters from brothers

00:09:56.929 --> 00:09:59.330
and sisters around the world.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.929
Those letters really helped me to endure with happiness.

00:10:02.929 --> 00:10:07.450
Close to 500 complaints were filed with the United Nations Human Rights Committee on

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:09.129
behalf of these brothers.

00:10:09.129 --> 00:10:14.970
The committee ruled in favor of the brothers every time, and really all of this is in harmony

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:15.970
with the principal.

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:22.929
The admonition we find in 2nd Kings, 13, 19, that is to strike our arrows repeatedly on

00:10:22.929 --> 00:10:24.169
the ground.

00:10:24.169 --> 00:10:30.090
These wonderful international decisions, along with the fine efforts of our young brothers

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:36.289
in court that had been prepared by the elders, well, this sent shockwaves through the legal

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.529
system in Korea.

00:10:38.529 --> 00:10:46.529
Jehovah has greatly blessed the various efforts made, not only in Korea, but also internationally.

00:10:46.529 --> 00:10:52.210
The majority of the brothers made their defense without a lawyer, skillfully using only the

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:53.610
legal packet.

00:10:53.610 --> 00:11:00.210
As a result, local courts throughout Korea rendered more than 100 not guilty decisions.

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:03.610
How did this affect the Supreme Court's decision?

00:11:04.169 --> 00:11:11.049
On June 28, 2018, the Constitutional Court of Korea ruled that an individual's right to

00:11:11.049 --> 00:11:16.090
refuse military service according to his own conscience should be protected by the Constitution

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:17.090
of Korea.

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:22.090
Furthermore, it declared that the government must provide and implement alternative service

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:24.090
by 2020.

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:29.289
So now it was the Supreme Court's turn to respond to this historic decision by the Constitutional

00:11:29.289 --> 00:11:30.289
Court.

00:11:30.289 --> 00:11:35.289
All attention was focused on whether or not it would protect the conscientious objectors

00:11:35.289 --> 00:11:38.129
and declare our brothers not guilty.

00:11:38.129 --> 00:11:41.809
The Supreme Court held a public hearing on August 30.

00:11:41.809 --> 00:11:45.809
What preparations were made and what was the result?

00:11:45.809 --> 00:11:49.970
The governing body made some very loving arrangements through the legal department at World

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.529
Headquarters.

00:11:51.529 --> 00:11:56.769
They had 14 lawyers from five branches around the world assist us to thoroughly prepare

00:11:56.769 --> 00:11:59.529
for the public hearing.

00:11:59.529 --> 00:12:03.169
The public hearing was broadcast live on the Internet.

00:12:03.169 --> 00:12:08.009
Later, many brothers told us that they were watching the hearing and praying earnestly

00:12:08.009 --> 00:12:09.009
for us.

00:12:09.009 --> 00:12:14.169
Thanks to their support, we were able to respond appropriately to the judge's aggressive

00:12:14.169 --> 00:12:16.210
questions.

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:24.409
As stated at 1 Peter 315, we did so with a mild temper and deep respect.

00:12:24.409 --> 00:12:29.690
Those two months after the August 30th public hearing, the Supreme Court announced that

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:33.690
the defendant was not guilty.

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:41.250
In effect, the highest court confirmed that Jehovah's Witnesses were not criminals.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:48.850
This historic ruling is the result of the faithful endurance of over 19,000 brothers

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:53.289
along with the tears and the sacrifices of their families.

00:12:53.289 --> 00:12:58.889
I believe these momentous legal victories were possible because of their deep love for

00:12:58.889 --> 00:13:05.139
Jehovah and their long history of faith and courage.

00:13:05.139 --> 00:13:13.019
Our Korean brothers suffered injustice and went to prison rather than violate their conscience.

00:13:13.019 --> 00:13:17.659
They remembered 1 Peter 2 and verse 20.

00:13:17.659 --> 00:13:25.100
If you endure suffering because of doing good, this is an agreeable thing to God.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:34.820
We rejoice that their courageous stand has finally been recognized and that this injustice

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.580
has ended.

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:42.500
This historic legal victory and the integrity of the Korean brothers have certainly exalted

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:46.100
Jehovah's name and upheld his sovereignty.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:51.340
When all the imprisoned brothers were finally released, brothers and sisters around the world

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.100
rejoiced.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:59.059
No doubt all of us are united and sincere thanks to our father Jehovah for this wonderful

00:13:59.059 --> 00:14:00.580
triumph.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:07.620
Jehovah gave our Korean brothers the strength to endure with faith and courage.

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:13.139
We are confident that he will do the same for all our beloved brothers and sisters around

00:14:13.139 --> 00:14:16.379
the world who are imprisoned because of their faith.
