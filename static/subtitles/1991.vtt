00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:09.890
An introduction to the Book of Ephesians, the Apostle Paul first came to the port city

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:19.370
of Ephesus on a second missionary tour, probably in 52 CE, accompanied by Aquila and Priscilla.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:25.250
After a short visit, Paul departed leaving Aquila and Priscilla behind to continue preaching

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.170
and teaching.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.170
But on his third missionary tour, Paul stayed for about three years, zealously carrying

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:41.049
out his ministry and forming a close bond with the Ephesian brothers.

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:47.950
Later about sixty or sixty-one CE, the Apostle Paul wrote the letter to the Ephesian congregation.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:54.950
He wrote it from Rome where he was under guard awaiting trial.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.250
The letter to the Ephesians has six chapters.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.849
After one highlights that God purposed an administration or a way of managing his household.

00:01:06.849 --> 00:01:12.329
By this means, those chosen to live in heaven and those who would live on earth would be

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:17.150
united with Jehovah through Christ.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.269
In chapter 2 the Apostle likens the Mosaic law to a wall that had long separated Jews

00:01:23.269 --> 00:01:26.510
and Gentiles.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.870
The sacrificial death of Jesus abolished the law covenant and thus destroyed the wall

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.390
in between the two groups.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.629
In chapter 3, Paul mentions the sacred secret of the Christ and explains that it is God's

00:01:41.629 --> 00:01:47.590
will to include non-Jews among the relatively small number of humans who are called to

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.829
reign with Christ in heaven.

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:53.549
Did you know?

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:00.230
The city of Ephesus was famous for a huge temple dedicated to the goddess Artemis.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:06.989
As related in Acts chapter 19, Silversmiths of Ephesus had a lucrative business selling

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:10.750
small silver shrines of Artemis.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.069
During his roughly three-year stay in Ephesus, Paul had exposed as wrong the use of images

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.830
in worship.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:26.150
As a result, a number of people in Ephesus abandoned their idolatry and became believers.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:36.210
Because of that, those making and selling such idols became infuriated and caused a riot.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:42.050
In chapter 4 the Ephesians are counseled to put away the old personality according to

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:50.009
their former conduct and to put on the new personality in harmony with Jehovah's will.

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:56.490
In chapter 5, Paul encourages the Ephesians to go on walking in love.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.810
That love should be reflected in the family.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.090
Wives are counseled to be in subjection to their husbands.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.129
Husbands are counseled to continue loving their wives, just as the Christ also loved the

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.240
congregation.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.360
In chapter 6, Paul uses an illustration about armor and urges the Ephesians to put on

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.270
the complete suit of spiritual armor.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:31.949
Doing so will help them to remain faithful despite all difficulties.

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:37.909
As you read the inspired letter to the Ephesians, note how we must put on the new personality

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:44.550
according to Jehovah's will, how we should put on the complete suit of spiritual armor,

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.150
and how Jehovah purposed to unite Jews and non-Jews as heirs with Christ in the kingdom.
