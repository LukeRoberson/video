00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.929
Warm greetings to one and all.

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:23.929
The final session of our powerful by-faith regional convention is about to begin.

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:26.929
As you watch the music video presentation,

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:31.929
reflect on how strong faith helps us triumph when our integrity is tested.

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:33.929
Please enjoy the video.

00:00:33.929 --> 00:07:02.269
The light I should I fear it gel over by my side.

00:07:02.269 --> 00:07:05.269
I will not run and hide.

00:07:05.269 --> 00:07:11.269
My God is with me this I know.

00:07:11.269 --> 00:07:22.449
With eyes of faith, the dark eyes of nothing.

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:28.899
It gel over I am strong.

00:09:45.809 --> 00:10:50.070
We have now reached the final portion of this convention.

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:56.070
In this session, we'll see how Bible prophecy strengthens our faith

00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:00.070
and we'll take an exciting look ahead of future events.

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:06.070
First, let's sing a song that expresses our determination to exercise faith.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:09.070
The song is number 126 entitled,

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:13.070
stay awake, stand firm, grow mighty.

00:11:13.070 --> 00:13:25.259
Again, that song number 126.

00:13:25.259 --> 00:13:29.259
We saw how Daniel the Prophet showed faith as a young man.

00:13:29.259 --> 00:13:32.259
What further testly ahead?

00:13:32.259 --> 00:13:35.259
And how did Jehovah strengthen him?

00:13:35.259 --> 00:13:38.259
We now invite you to watch part two of the drama,

00:13:38.259 --> 00:13:41.259
Daniel, a lifetime of faith.

00:13:41.259 --> 00:14:52.190
Over here.

00:14:53.190 --> 00:16:39.720
The Queen Mother, my Lord.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.289
May you live on forever.

00:16:43.289 --> 00:16:47.659
There's a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the Holy Gods.

00:16:47.659 --> 00:16:50.230
Tell you the interpretation.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:52.230
Who is this man?

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:56.299
Daniel.

00:16:56.299 --> 00:16:57.299
Who's Daniel?

00:16:57.299 --> 00:17:44.519
Are you Daniel?

00:17:44.519 --> 00:17:46.519
I am my Lord.

00:17:46.519 --> 00:17:53.500
I've heard concerning you that you're able to provide interpretations.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:57.500
Now, if you're able to read the writing

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.500
and make its interpretation known to me,

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.500
then you will be clothed with purple.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:06.500
A gold necklace will be placed around your neck,

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.500
and you will rule as the third one in the kingdom.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.500
You may keep your gifts.

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:15.500
Give your presence to others.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:19.500
However, I will read the writing to the King.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:23.500
The most high God granted to Nebuchadnezzar the kingdom,

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.500
and greatness, and honor, and majesty.

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.500
But when his heart became haughty,

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.500
he was brought down from the throne of his kingdom,

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.500
and his dignity was taken away.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:45.609
But you, those Shazar,

00:18:45.609 --> 00:18:47.609
you have not humbled your heart,

00:18:47.609 --> 00:18:50.609
although you knew all of this.

00:18:50.609 --> 00:18:55.609
Instead, you exalted yourself against the Lord of the heavens.

00:18:55.609 --> 00:18:59.609
You had them bring you the vessels of his house,

00:18:59.609 --> 00:19:03.609
and then you, and your nobles,

00:19:03.609 --> 00:19:08.609
your concubines, and secondary wives drank wine from them,

00:19:08.609 --> 00:19:12.609
and praised the gods of silver and gold,

00:19:12.609 --> 00:19:20.359
gods who see nothing, and hear nothing, and know nothing.

00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:25.859
But you've not glorified the God,

00:19:25.859 --> 00:19:30.859
and whose hand is your breath, and all your ways.

00:19:30.859 --> 00:19:35.859
So the hand was sent from him.

00:19:35.859 --> 00:19:45.730
This is the interpretation of the words, meaning,

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:49.730
God has numbered the days of your kingdom,

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:52.730
and brought it to an end.

00:19:52.730 --> 00:20:08.259
T-Cal, you have been weighed in the balances,

00:20:08.259 --> 00:20:11.539
and found lacking.

00:20:11.539 --> 00:20:22.769
P-Res, your kingdom's been divided,

00:20:22.769 --> 00:20:29.140
and given to the meads and the Persians.

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:13.190
You can grasp this as Daniel, a Jew,

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:15.190
taken captive by the Babylonians.

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:21.369
Did you interpret the handwriting from the gods?

00:21:21.369 --> 00:21:24.369
No.

00:21:24.369 --> 00:21:33.130
And not me, O King, my God, the God of Israel.

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:37.130
We could use a seetrap who understands the captives.

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:41.130
I confess, a seetrap is not,

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:45.130
it's prominent position, as Boshazar granted you.

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:48.130
My Lord, Daniel refused every gift,

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:53.460
and honor Boshazar offered him.

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.460
Banned without a price.

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:58.460
We don't need you as a seetrap.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:05.259
We need you over them.

00:22:05.259 --> 00:22:10.259
Tura pronounced Daniel's appointment throughout the kingdom.

00:22:10.259 --> 00:22:13.259
I want those stealing from the treasury to know

00:22:13.259 --> 00:22:14.259
that they will now be held accountable.

00:22:14.259 --> 00:22:44.660
Daniel, you'll make a fine high official.

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:48.539
Only with Jehovah's help.

00:22:48.539 --> 00:23:17.710
You still land tax-wide.

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:27.579
Another revolt?

00:23:27.579 --> 00:23:29.579
This is far more troubling.

00:23:29.579 --> 00:23:31.579
I just collected the land tax from an administrator.

00:23:31.579 --> 00:23:33.579
Did he pay?

00:23:33.579 --> 00:23:36.579
Yes, but he refuses to give us our fees.

00:23:36.579 --> 00:23:38.579
I've heard the same problem.

00:23:38.579 --> 00:23:41.579
They're calling anything more than the tax extortion.

00:23:41.579 --> 00:23:43.579
What's changed?

00:23:43.579 --> 00:23:44.579
Daniel.

00:23:44.579 --> 00:23:48.829
Have you offered him anything to make him more reasonable?

00:23:48.829 --> 00:23:50.829
He won't take a shackle of silver.

00:23:50.829 --> 00:23:54.829
Daniel claims that what he receives is more than enough.

00:23:54.829 --> 00:23:56.829
Don't be so naive.

00:23:56.829 --> 00:23:59.829
He's putting on a show of integrity for the king.

00:23:59.829 --> 00:24:01.829
It won't last.

00:24:01.829 --> 00:24:04.829
Dress will tire him soon enough.

00:24:04.829 --> 00:24:16.569
There seems to be a discrepancy in the taxes to the treasury.

00:24:16.569 --> 00:24:18.569
My Lord.

00:24:18.569 --> 00:24:21.569
You're brave to say that here.

00:24:21.569 --> 00:24:23.569
I know it's hard to hear.

00:24:24.569 --> 00:24:26.569
We'll review the evidence.

00:24:26.569 --> 00:24:30.569
Daniel, your time here has given you much wisdom.

00:24:30.569 --> 00:24:32.569
How long have you been here?

00:24:32.569 --> 00:24:35.569
Over 70 years.

00:24:35.569 --> 00:24:37.569
Share more with me.

00:24:37.569 --> 00:24:41.569
Tell me about the dreams you interpreted for Nebuchadnezzar.

00:24:41.569 --> 00:24:44.569
Interpretations belong to my God, Jehovah.

00:24:44.569 --> 00:24:47.569
He revealed the dreams to me.

00:24:47.569 --> 00:25:03.349
Have I really been in Babylon over 70 years?

00:25:03.349 --> 00:25:29.940
Jeremiah's prophecy.

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:31.940
When 70 years have been fulfilled,

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:36.940
I'll call to account the king of Babylon and that nation for their error.

00:25:36.940 --> 00:26:03.329
What does this mean for God's people?

00:26:03.329 --> 00:26:30.990
When 70 years of Babylon are fulfilled, I will turn my attention to you.

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:39.299
And I will make good my promise by bringing you back to this place.

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:58.059
Judah must approach Jehovah to confess this sin of my people.

00:26:58.059 --> 00:27:05.380
Over Jehovah.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:10.940
You do here, but do forgive.

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:15.509
But Jehovah, do pay attention and act.

00:27:15.509 --> 00:27:19.509
Do not delay for your own sake.

00:27:19.509 --> 00:27:26.700
Oh my God.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:33.289
Oh Daniel, I've come to give you insight and understanding.

00:27:33.289 --> 00:27:38.880
When you began your intriguing word went out.

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:59.279
I have come to work with you.

00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:02.279
Daniel, as they're all in here.

00:28:02.279 --> 00:28:03.279
Hello Daniel.

00:28:03.279 --> 00:28:06.279
It's so good to see you.

00:28:06.279 --> 00:28:09.279
Efer, come sit with me.

00:28:09.279 --> 00:28:14.509
I have good news.

00:28:14.509 --> 00:28:15.509
What's the good news?

00:28:15.509 --> 00:28:20.140
Jehovah has long told this.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:23.140
We will return to Judah.

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:27.140
I looked again at Jeremiah's prophecy.

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:32.990
This is what Jehovah says.

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:43.990
When 70 years of Babylon are fulfilled, I will make good my promise by bringing you back to this place.

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:45.990
70 years.

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:48.990
That means God's people will return soon.

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:55.180
How can you be sure?

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:57.180
Jehovah's in an angel to tell me.

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.180
An angel?

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:04.180
He said that the city and its temple will be rebuilt.

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:08.180
And Messiah will finally come.

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:12.180
You will get to see the temple rebuilt.

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.180
But won't it be dangerous?

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:22.880
Jehovah is eager to fulfill the needs of his people.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.880
He told Isaiah,

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:30.130
We will bear children for distress.

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:32.130
For there's the offspring,

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:35.130
made up of those blessed by Jehovah.

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:37.130
And if Jehovah says it,

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:39.130
It's as good as them.

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:42.130
But isn't the land desolate?

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:47.130
That's why we all need skilled builders for the restoration work.

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:50.130
Does this mean you'll return to Judah?

00:29:50.130 --> 00:30:03.900
I sure hope so.

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.900
Have a team of workers maintain the roads.

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:10.900
Otherwise, conditions will only worsen during the rainy season.

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:14.500
Teracy that is done.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.500
How is it that you know so much?

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.500
Well, I can't take credit.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:19.500
My Lord, I just...

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:26.200
We have many great men who provide the information we need, O King.

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:31.700
Daniel, about that seetrap in Susa.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.700
Should he be replaced?

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:37.700
My men have thoroughly investigated.

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:40.700
And the seetrap has been diverting palace money

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.700
to his own pocket.

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:43.700
That's impossible.

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:44.700
Isn't he your nephew?

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:45.700
What's on us?

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:46.700
Indeed.

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:49.700
And I can vouch for his integrity.

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.700
There must be some mistake.

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:55.700
How can Daniel know his character as I do?

00:30:55.700 --> 00:31:01.500
I will speak with him and resolve the matter.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:06.500
We means in Persians are not as intolerant as these Jews.

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:09.500
I'm sure we can fix this.

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:13.500
Very well, settle it quickly, and that will be all.

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:53.829
My Lord, I'm so sorry.

00:31:53.829 --> 00:31:54.829
You have guests.

00:31:54.829 --> 00:32:10.599
All you Jews do is pray.

00:32:10.599 --> 00:32:17.099
I could not serve the King the way I do without God's help.

00:32:17.099 --> 00:32:22.099
Serve the King by intimidating seetraps.

00:32:22.099 --> 00:32:24.099
I've only done what I should.

00:32:24.099 --> 00:32:28.099
An outsider has no place telling us how to conduct business.

00:32:28.099 --> 00:32:31.920
I act in the King's interest.

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:36.920
We've heard how you acted in Nebuchadnezzar's interest.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:40.740
You made him go insane.

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:42.740
That was a message from Jehovah.

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:46.740
Call it what you will, but do not interfere with us.

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:54.230
If it seemed easy to remove a seetrap,

00:32:54.230 --> 00:33:25.240
think of how much easier it will be to get rid of an old Jew.

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.240
To honor, to be with you.

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.240
Do you know why someone do?

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.240
No, my Lord.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:33.240
That seetrap, who's dismissal, Daniel recommended.

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.240
What's become of him?

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.240
Yes.

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:39.240
We thoroughly investigated the matter.

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:40.240
Was there negligence?

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.240
None.

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.240
Any omission of duty?

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.240
Not at all.

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:48.240
All taxes do the treasury have come to the treasury?

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:52.240
Every shackle of gold and court of beer are accounted for.

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:57.519
Daniel reached a different conclusion.

00:33:57.519 --> 00:34:01.519
My Daniel, he served the Babylonian kings well.

00:34:01.519 --> 00:34:03.519
But he's so old.

00:34:03.519 --> 00:34:06.519
What autonomous means is, at Daniel's age,

00:34:06.519 --> 00:34:08.519
how reliable is his judgment?

00:34:08.519 --> 00:34:11.519
His ideas are outdated.

00:34:11.519 --> 00:34:14.519
Besides, he is a Jew.

00:34:14.519 --> 00:34:16.519
We're tolerant of all peoples.

00:34:16.519 --> 00:34:17.519
Yes.

00:34:17.519 --> 00:34:18.519
Of course, that's my point.

00:34:18.519 --> 00:34:22.730
Daniel, we were just talking about you.

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:24.730
You were right.

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:26.730
There's been a revolt in Susa.

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:30.010
They demanded a new seetrap.

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:32.010
One who doesn't steal from that.

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:34.010
But, my Lord, surely...

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:35.010
Enough!

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:37.010
I sent my own inspectors.

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:39.010
Men, I trust.

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:45.730
Daniel, you've distinguished yourself over these men.

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:51.969
Imagine what I could do if you were my prime minister.

00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:59.309
Perhaps we could approach the king.

00:34:59.309 --> 00:35:01.309
That's no use.

00:35:01.309 --> 00:35:03.309
Daniel's manipulating him.

00:35:03.309 --> 00:35:05.309
We need an accusation against Daniel.

00:35:05.309 --> 00:35:07.309
Something to rise can't ignore.

00:35:07.309 --> 00:35:09.309
But no one's accused him of anything.

00:35:09.309 --> 00:35:11.309
Not yet.

00:35:11.309 --> 00:35:13.309
Assemble the team to comb through our laws.

00:35:13.309 --> 00:35:15.309
Surely he's violated something.

00:35:15.309 --> 00:35:19.309
You interview merchants, inspectors, officials,

00:35:19.309 --> 00:35:21.309
where we'll make an accusation against him.

00:35:21.309 --> 00:35:23.309
Sure, the accuser.

00:35:23.309 --> 00:35:26.309
He will be generously rewarded.

00:35:26.309 --> 00:35:28.309
We have the Babylonian records.

00:35:28.309 --> 00:35:31.309
Search for any scandal that might implicate him.

00:35:31.309 --> 00:36:00.460
There's nothing in the records.

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:02.460
Anything.

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:05.460
Not a shekel of silver is missing.

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:08.460
In fact, when Daniel gets involved,

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:10.460
corruption and loss go down.

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:13.900
Keep searching.

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:20.949
No one will speak against him.

00:36:20.949 --> 00:36:25.480
They all love him.

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:31.769
And he has the king's trust.

00:36:31.769 --> 00:36:41.119
Usually the foreign merchants are ignored when they experience theft.

00:36:41.119 --> 00:36:44.119
However, Daniel stands up for them and investigates.

00:36:44.119 --> 00:36:49.199
He has these returned, whatever was stolen.

00:36:49.199 --> 00:36:53.739
Even his friends are spotless.

00:36:54.739 --> 00:36:58.739
Maybe it can never once forbade anyone to speak against their God.

00:36:58.739 --> 00:37:03.739
Supposedly, this Jehovah saved them from the furnace

00:37:03.739 --> 00:37:06.739
when they refused to worship the Babylonian God.

00:37:06.739 --> 00:37:08.739
Jews went worship other gods.

00:37:08.739 --> 00:37:16.130
So it would seem to think you've solved our problem.

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:19.179
Katu?

00:37:19.179 --> 00:37:20.179
Litanas?

00:37:20.179 --> 00:37:22.179
What favor do you seek?

00:37:22.179 --> 00:37:25.179
A king to rise may live on forever.

00:37:25.179 --> 00:37:29.179
This Babylon of which you are king is mighty but diverse.

00:37:29.179 --> 00:37:33.179
There are Babylonians, Egyptians, Greeks, and others.

00:37:33.179 --> 00:37:36.179
Just Otanas, I know these things.

00:37:36.179 --> 00:37:41.179
You are the rightful king, but also a foreigner and a newcomer.

00:37:41.179 --> 00:37:46.179
The people must adapt, or the kingdom could become unstable.

00:37:46.179 --> 00:37:49.179
What do you suggest?

00:37:49.179 --> 00:37:52.179
All royal officials, prefects, say traps,

00:37:52.179 --> 00:37:55.179
high royal officers, and governors

00:37:55.179 --> 00:37:59.179
have consulted together to establish a royal decree

00:37:59.179 --> 00:38:01.179
and to enforce a ban.

00:38:01.179 --> 00:38:06.179
For 30 days, whoever makes a petition to any God or man

00:38:06.179 --> 00:38:12.179
except to you, O king, should be thrown into the landspit.

00:38:12.179 --> 00:38:15.179
The people are not above rebellion.

00:38:15.179 --> 00:38:17.179
Look what happened in Susa.

00:38:17.179 --> 00:38:25.719
Now, O king, may you establish the decree and sign it.

00:38:26.719 --> 00:38:29.719
So that it cannot be changed according to the law

00:38:29.719 --> 00:38:31.719
of the needs and the Persians.

00:38:31.719 --> 00:38:36.219
Which cannot be annulled.

00:38:36.219 --> 00:38:50.170
At this time, our empire experiences peace

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:53.170
and prosperity unlike ever seen before.

00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:56.170
The recent acts of defiance in Susa,

00:38:56.170 --> 00:39:00.170
along with similar acts by small groups of radicals,

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:03.170
seek to undermine our way of life.

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:09.170
A way of life, we will sacrifice for nothing.

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:12.170
In honor of the glorious freedom

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:15.170
so kindly granted by the empire,

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:18.170
and as a reminder of its sovereignty,

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:22.170
I, derise the need to make this decree.

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:28.170
For 30 days, anyone who makes a petition to any God or man

00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:32.170
except to the king, should be thrown into the landspit.

00:39:32.170 --> 00:40:00.500
I'm going to pray, are you?

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:01.500
That's right.

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:10.219
You know me.

00:40:10.219 --> 00:40:12.219
And so do my enemies.

00:40:12.219 --> 00:40:14.219
I pray at my window.

00:40:14.219 --> 00:40:16.219
Three times a day.

00:40:16.219 --> 00:40:19.219
Every day.

00:40:19.219 --> 00:40:24.559
If I even appeared to compromise,

00:40:24.559 --> 00:40:28.539
what would they think?

00:40:28.539 --> 00:40:30.539
That you stopped praying altogether.

00:40:30.539 --> 00:40:32.539
Or even worse.

00:40:32.539 --> 00:40:35.539
That I had trained my worship

00:40:35.539 --> 00:40:38.539
for my life.

00:40:38.539 --> 00:40:40.539
I know Jehovah.

00:40:40.539 --> 00:40:43.539
And if I trust him,

00:40:43.539 --> 00:40:45.539
he'll reward me.

00:40:45.539 --> 00:40:54.150
I don't know how, but he will.

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:57.150
Pray that I keep my faith,

00:40:57.150 --> 00:41:01.619
that we all keep our faith,

00:41:01.619 --> 00:41:04.619
no matter how this ends.

00:41:25.199 --> 00:41:58.690
I have something for you.

00:41:58.690 --> 00:42:09.900
Hear me, O Jehovah.

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:26.880
Show me your favor.

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:27.880
And answer me.

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:31.380
Your face.

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:34.380
O Jehovah, I will seek to find

00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:39.420
for you are my helper.

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:52.760
Or leave me God of salvation.

00:42:52.760 --> 00:44:02.900
O Kim, may you live on forever.

00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:07.880
Did you not sign a band,

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:10.880
stating that for 30 days

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:14.880
any man who makes a petition to any God or man?

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:16.880
Except to you, O Kim.

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:18.880
Should be thrown into the lance pit?

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:20.880
Yes, the matter is well established

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:22.880
according to the law of the Means and Persians.

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:24.880
What's your business?

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:29.670
Daniel, who is of the Exiles of Judah,

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:32.670
has paid no regard to you, O Kim,

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:37.650
nor to the band that you signed.

00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:40.650
But three times a day, he is praying.

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:59.489
Daniel, it can't be true.

00:44:59.489 --> 00:45:02.489
Are you sure?

00:45:02.489 --> 00:45:04.489
He doesn't even try to deny it.

00:45:04.489 --> 00:45:09.110
Where are their witnesses?

00:45:09.110 --> 00:45:11.110
All five of us, my Lord.

00:45:11.110 --> 00:45:13.110
We can't test him.

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:15.110
But he is old.

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:17.110
Does he know what he's doing?

00:45:17.110 --> 00:45:19.110
As a high official,

00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:21.110
surely he understands what it means

00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:23.110
to obey the King?

00:45:23.110 --> 00:45:28.860
Let me be.

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:29.860
Should we arrest?

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:31.860
Leave the matter to me.

00:45:31.860 --> 00:46:30.920
Daniel should indeed be made an example of.

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:32.920
I will remove him from his post

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:35.920
and expel him from the city tomorrow morning.

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:36.920
My Lord.

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:39.920
All will learn that our laws must be obeyed.

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:41.920
But the law actually states

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:45.920
that the accused would be thrown into the lion spit my Lord.

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:47.920
I see what you're doing.

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:49.920
Have you no shame?

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:52.920
The law of the Meads and the Persians

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:54.920
is that any ban or decree

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:56.920
that the King establishes

00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:58.920
cannot be changed.

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:00.920
We only wish the King

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:03.920
to receive the honor he deserves.

00:47:03.920 --> 00:49:53.539
Your God, when we are continually serving,

00:49:53.539 --> 00:49:55.539
will rescue you.

00:49:55.539 --> 00:50:12.480
Remove the stone.

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:22.539
Daniel.

00:50:22.539 --> 00:50:27.409
Daniel.

00:50:27.409 --> 00:50:31.219
Okay.

00:50:31.219 --> 00:50:34.219
May you live on forever.

00:50:34.219 --> 00:50:38.139
Lives.

00:50:38.139 --> 00:50:39.139
Bring him up.

00:50:39.139 --> 00:50:42.139
My God sent his angel

00:50:42.139 --> 00:50:45.139
and shut the mouths of the lions.

00:50:45.139 --> 00:50:48.139
And they have not harmed me.

00:50:48.139 --> 00:50:53.809
For I was found innocent before him.

00:50:53.809 --> 00:51:01.190
Nor have I done any wrong to you.

00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:02.190
Okay.

00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:10.730
Armenia is mine.

00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:12.730
Daniel let them off too easily.

00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:15.730
We need their exceptional horses for our cavalry

00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:21.630
and a few for themselves.

00:51:21.630 --> 00:51:22.630
Fine.

00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:24.630
You take Armenia.

00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:26.630
I have my own bacteria

00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:29.630
and it's precious stones.

00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:34.170
Must you divide up a Daniel's kingdom now?

00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:35.170
The battle will.

00:51:35.170 --> 00:51:42.610
The meaning of this.

00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:45.610
You're being arrested for crimes against the rice.

00:51:45.610 --> 00:51:46.610
The King.

00:51:46.610 --> 00:51:48.610
The King ordered Daniel's arrest not ours.

00:51:48.610 --> 00:51:50.610
Daniel was arrested.

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:55.460
And lifted from the pit this morning.

00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:57.460
Unharmed.

00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:59.460
They can't be.

00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:01.460
The lions must have already been fed.

00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:05.860
Perhaps they were ill.

00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:09.619
The lions were ill.

00:52:09.619 --> 00:52:10.619
Not hungry.

00:52:10.619 --> 00:52:20.969
Throw them in their families into the pit.

00:52:20.969 --> 00:52:22.969
Or they can test their duties.

00:52:22.969 --> 00:52:23.969
No!

00:52:23.969 --> 00:52:27.380
Please don't kill this!

00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:28.380
No!

00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:42.780
I'm issuing an order that in every domain of my kingdom,

00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:47.780
people are to tremble in fear before the God of Daniel.

00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:50.780
For he is the living God and he endures forever.

00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:52.780
His kingdom will never be the same.

00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:59.780
He rescues, saves, and performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth.

00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:02.780
For he rescues Daniel from the paw of the lions.

00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:04.780
Do I ask for that?

00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:07.780
He's sending it to all of his subjects.

00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:09.780
You were so worried.

00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:11.780
Were you scared?

00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:13.780
I was very scared.

00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:17.780
But Jehovah helps us when we're scared.

00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:20.780
They're scared of going to Jerusalem.

00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:21.780
Me, for...

00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:26.780
We're still thinking about it.

00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:28.780
About you.

00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:29.780
Are you going back?

00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:31.780
The King says we're all allowed to go.

00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:41.780
I'd love to go home.

00:53:41.780 --> 00:54:01.449
I think it's too late for me.

00:54:01.449 --> 00:54:14.000
I'm gonna go either.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000
Oh, no, no.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:22.260
Don't cry.

00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:27.260
If you go, you'll see a better city than the one I left.

00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:30.659
You'll see prophecies fulfilled.

00:54:30.659 --> 00:54:37.289
A city full of people worshiping Jehovah.

00:54:37.289 --> 00:54:42.420
New temple.

00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:45.420
The most beautiful building on earth.

00:54:45.420 --> 00:55:58.570
Stay close to Jehovah.

00:55:58.570 --> 00:56:00.570
You will be blessed.

00:56:00.570 --> 00:56:32.119
That I might dwell in the house of Jehovah.

00:56:32.119 --> 00:56:35.119
All the days of my life.

00:56:35.119 --> 00:57:03.119
To gaze and to look with appreciation.

00:57:03.119 --> 00:57:10.820
It's terrible.

00:57:10.820 --> 00:58:08.510
Daniel, you need to rest.

00:58:08.510 --> 00:59:10.139
Oh, Daniel, you very precious man.

00:59:10.139 --> 00:59:12.139
I have been sent to you.

00:59:12.139 --> 00:59:16.510
Do not be afraid, Daniel.

00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:18.510
Your words have been heard from the first day

00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:20.510
you gave your heart to understanding

00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:23.510
and humbling yourself before your God.

00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:25.510
I have come to make you understand

00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:29.510
what will befall your people in the final part of the days.

00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:32.510
I have no strength.

00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:34.510
There's a breath left in me.

00:59:34.510 --> 00:59:37.510
Do not be afraid of very precious man.

00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:39.510
May you have peace.

00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:43.460
Be strong.

00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:55.250
Be strong.

00:59:55.250 --> 00:59:57.250
And my Lord speak.

00:59:57.250 --> 00:59:59.250
For you have strengthened me.

00:59:59.250 --> 01:00:03.250
I will tell you the things recorded in the writings of truth.

01:00:03.250 --> 01:00:07.250
Look, three more kings will stand up for Persia.

01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:29.639
And the fourth one will have mass greater riches than me.

01:00:29.639 --> 01:00:34.639
Oh, my Lord, what will be the outcome of these things?

01:00:34.639 --> 01:00:37.639
Happy as the one who keeps an expectation.

01:00:37.639 --> 01:00:41.849
Go on to the end.

01:00:41.849 --> 01:00:45.849
You will rest, but you will stand up for your lot

01:00:45.849 --> 01:00:47.849
at the end of the days.

01:00:47.849 --> 01:01:10.269
If we eat those foods, we'll disobey our God.

01:01:10.269 --> 01:01:12.269
You fear your God?

01:01:12.269 --> 01:01:17.760
I do.

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:20.760
Interpretations belong to my God, Jehovah.

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.760
I know that He will reveal it to me.

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:32.280
Jehovah is to fulfill the needs of His people.

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:45.059
And if I trust Him...

01:01:45.059 --> 01:02:28.670
What an inspiring account.

01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:34.670
Like Daniel, we look to Jehovah for strength and protection.

01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:38.670
Our next song expresses our confidence in Him.

01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:43.670
The song is entitled Seek God for Your Deliverance.

01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:47.670
Let's sing together song number 150.

01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:50.670
Again, that song number 150.
