00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:08.349
Welcome to JW Broadcasting. On our program for this month, we'll hear the

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:13.390
experience of Brother Jim Brown. He studied the Bible with Jehovah's Witnesses

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:19.710
off and on for 30 years. What motivated him to make changes and dedicate his

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.350
life to Jehovah? It's important for youth to develop good spiritual habits

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:30.309
early. How can teenagers get the most out of their daily Bible reading? We have

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:55.500
a lot to look forward to on the April 2018 edition of JW Broadcasting. As

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.859
gods were, such as the heart of a Bible student, they may need to make

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:05.099
significant changes to live by Jehovah's standards. We start our program with

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:11.540
just such a story. Meet Jim Brown, a brother from Key Largo, Florida in the

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.060
United States. Before becoming one of Jehovah's Witnesses, he was on a dangerous

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.659
path of vice and violence. What changes did he have to make on the road to true

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:36.659
worship? 53 years old. I was known as a troublemaker. I was fighting in the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.900
bars, come to a point where you began to enjoy it. He was flat out scary. He was a

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:50.420
very mean and violent man. So everybody kind of kept their distance from him. My

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.140
language was too testable. I would make grown men blush by the things that I

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.659
could say and things that I would do. It was involved with some bikers and they

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.939
were trying to prospect me into getting into their club. Things were escalating.

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:15.340
We got married very young and we were 17. And had my oldest daughter? I was the

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:22.939
mom and he lived a life of being out with his friends and partying.

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:26.780
About that time, my wife started studying a Bible which Jehovah's Witnesses. It was a

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.819
big change for her. But she explained the reason behind it. I couldn't argue with it.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:40.300
She talked me into studying. I studied from 28 years old to 30. I always

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.979
seen it. I always seen it. I know this is where I needed to be. Somehow I just

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:49.539
could never break free of the person that I was. My mom always raised us in the

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:54.900
truth growing up and that's what we knew. So then to see my dad where he was so

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.099
different but yet believed it to be the truth. And then to see that his lifestyle

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:07.020
didn't do him any good was kind of a good example of a bad example if that

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:15.469
makes sense. I was afraid of the change. People accepted me for who I was. Being

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:21.830
a tough guy. Being Jimmy Brown. The scripture comes to mind. I planted a

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.150
polished water. God kept making it grow. Many brothers have studied with Jim from

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.509
time to time over the years. I just happened to be the one at the time in his

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:39.189
life when he was taking the truth and running with it. Wanted to be a better

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:44.909
person. Actually, you know, this was just not the way of life that I wanted

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:51.189
anymore. He changed his friends. He changed his life. He changed his dress

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:56.750
and grooming. He changed his speech patterns. He changed the way he was a

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.310
grandfather. He changed the way he was a father. He changed the way he was a

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:07.580
husband. Everything changed about him. I knew the work that witnesses do. Going

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.539
out door to door, talking to people. I thought I could never do that. Whoa. Me

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:16.420
going door to door. I'm gonna run into people that I know. Did I drink with for

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:23.420
years and years? How can I face them now? I had always told my wife would be much

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.779
easier for you to become a witness if I didn't live here. But how wrong I was

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:38.620
because what a witness. My changes have been to so many people in town. One of

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:44.779
my favorite things to do is a bridge witness scene with my granddaughter. People

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:48.939
are fishing in the bridge. Some of them are all night. I even have return visits

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:52.540
that I do because people are regularly come down the weekend to fish on the

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.500
bridges. I seize every opportunity. My kids laugh at me. Who witnessed to

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.899
anybody, anytime, anywhere. You'll see some raggedy tag, the old rough guy

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:07.980
that he knew and brought to the kingdom hall. And a few weeks he's got a new

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:15.300
suit on, got a haircut, clean shaven. This is the effect he has on the people

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:22.860
that he comes in contact with. I love life now. I have two friends. I know that I

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:29.560
have hope for the future. Jehovah has seen something in me and he's brought it

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:35.319
to light. I am a good person. I can be a good human being. I can hope other

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:53.100
people I can be loved by him. It's a precious. Are you a Bible student who is

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:59.060
undecided on whether to commit your way to Jehovah? Take note of the trust and

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:05.019
confidence Brother Brown showed in dedicating his life to God. Be assured that

00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:10.620
Jehovah will guide and care for us if we give him the opportunity. Brother

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.259
Brown now enjoys the blessing of living under Jehovah's protection, serving

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:21.060
of the ministerial servant and regular pioneer. You too can experience Jehovah's

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:26.899
spiritual protection as we'll learn throughout our program. The theme of our

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:33.139
broadcast is a very comforting one, being securely wrapped in the bag of life

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:38.819
with Jehovah. Perhaps the thought of being securely wrapped makes us think of a

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:43.699
faithfully swaddled baby or being enveloped in the warm blanket on a cold

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:49.339
night. In the Bible, these words were uttered by the woman Abigail to Jehovah

00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:54.180
servant David. To understand the meaning of the words and their importance

00:06:54.180 --> 00:07:01.019
today, let's review the context the first Samuel chapter 25. David and 600 of

00:07:01.019 --> 00:07:05.459
his men were dwelling as fugitives. They eventually encountered men who

00:07:05.459 --> 00:07:10.699
worked as shepherds for Abigail's husband, Navel. David and his men began to

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:15.300
help guard Navel's flocks and serve as a protective wall for Navel's flocks

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:21.220
and servants against thieves and invaders who roamed through the wilderness. It

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:26.540
was likely challenging to find enough food for 600 soldiers. So David decided

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.500
to send 10 of his men to kindly ask Navel for food in repayment for the

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:40.060
services that they had performed. But at first Samuel chapter 25 verse 10 and 11

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:48.879
note Navel's reply. Navel answered David's servants, who is David? And who is the

00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:53.540
son of Jesse? Nowadays, many servants are breaking away from their

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:59.819
masters. Do I have to take my bread and my water and the meat that I butchered

00:07:59.819 --> 00:08:06.180
from my shears and give it to men who come from who knows where? This was not

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:11.459
the response that David and his men were expecting to hear. The Bible describes

00:08:11.459 --> 00:08:17.300
Navel as a very harsh, worthless man. And this is certainly evidence by his

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:23.379
reply. He screamed insults at the messengers and ridiculed David, comparing

00:08:23.379 --> 00:08:29.459
him to a runaway servant. So David decided to take matters into his own hands.

00:08:29.459 --> 00:08:37.379
And resolve the situation the way many people today might. By fighting. In verse 13,

00:08:37.379 --> 00:08:43.980
he has 400 of his men prepare themselves for battle with one mission to wipe out

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:49.980
every male and Navel's household. Eventually, we're getting back to Abigail

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:54.259
about what her husband had done. Without telling Navel, she gathered an

00:08:54.259 --> 00:08:58.580
abundance of food and went out to meet David. When she met up with him,

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:03.899
she poured out her heart at length, asking David to forgive her personally and

00:09:03.899 --> 00:09:09.019
making a powerful plea for mercy on behalf of her husband and her household.

00:09:09.019 --> 00:09:14.940
She acknowledged that Navel was a foolish and senseless man. So she urged David

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:19.539
not to take any action that might bring blood guilt upon him or cause him to be

00:09:19.539 --> 00:09:25.019
affected by a troubled conscience. As Abigail concluded her appeal to David,

00:09:25.019 --> 00:09:33.419
notice what she tells him in verse 29, the theme of our discussion. When

00:09:33.419 --> 00:09:39.500
someone rises up to pursue you and seeks your life, the life of my Lord will be

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:44.820
wrapped securely in the bag of life with Jehovah your God. But the lives of

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:51.330
your enemies, he will hurl away like stones from a sling, just as we might wrap

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:56.090
up something valuable in order to protect and preserve it. Abigail was

00:09:56.090 --> 00:10:01.250
telling David that is how his life would be in Jehovah's hands. Jehovah would

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:06.090
protect and preserve David's life from his enemies. As long as he did not seek

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:12.169
to save himself by personal efforts, but waited on Jehovah, trusting in the one

00:10:12.169 --> 00:10:20.340
to whom he owed his life. What lessons can we learn from this account? As David

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:25.779
saw, his relationship with Jehovah was a protection. In verse 32, he

00:10:25.779 --> 00:10:31.500
acknowledges that God has sent Abigail with the warning. We learn that Jehovah's

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:36.659
spiritual protection for us is related to the quality of our relationship with

00:10:36.659 --> 00:10:45.259
him. That's why the Bible tells us at James chapter 4, verse 8, draw close to

00:10:45.259 --> 00:10:51.940
God and he will draw close to you. Jehovah invites us to draw near to him

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:58.299
because he wants to receive us into his favor as his friends. When we dedicate

00:10:58.299 --> 00:11:03.139
our lives and vow to serve him unconditionally, we gain an approved standing

00:11:03.139 --> 00:11:08.820
with him, we're figuratively put in that bag of life. And as we work to develop a

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:13.500
close personal relationship with him, then we can experience Jehovah's

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:18.820
friendship and protection. We would never want to restrict Jehovah's protection

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:25.340
by not looking to him for guidance or relying on our own thinking. Now, can we

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:30.980
think of areas or situations that might require us to wait on Jehovah? Perhaps

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:37.100
we're experiencing literal opposition at work or at school. Like Abigail, he

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:41.500
might face the challenge of living with a difficult marriage made. Maybe we're

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:47.460
battling a health issue and loyalty is needed regarding our medical choices. Or

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:51.580
it may be that we live in a country where we cannot preach freely or we face

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:58.419
opposition for our beliefs. Really, it could be any number of situations, but it is

00:11:58.419 --> 00:12:05.379
our response the way we handle the situation that indicates how much we are

00:12:05.379 --> 00:12:11.580
allowing Jehovah to help us. Do we trust him enough that we can leave the

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:18.299
matter in his hands and see how he works things out in our behalf? We have to

00:12:18.299 --> 00:12:23.500
manifest Christian qualities in order to do that. Think about what qualities

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:29.019
displayed by Abigail and David impress you most. Two, they come to mind are

00:12:29.019 --> 00:12:34.860
patience and reasonableness. Patience is closely connected with endurance and

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:40.220
enables one to put up with difficult circumstances while maintaining a positive

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:47.580
attitude. Reasonableness describes a person who is fair, considerate, willing to

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:53.659
yield to others. How well this describes Abigail? It must have been quite a

00:12:53.659 --> 00:12:58.700
challenge to live with someone like Nebel. But nowhere do we read that she was

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:03.940
ever disrespectful of him or that she belittled him. Even when she referred to

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:09.220
him as senseless in verse 25, from Jehovah's standpoint, her comments were

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:16.059
proper because Nebel's actions put his entire household in danger. How about

00:13:16.059 --> 00:13:21.580
David? He was in a position of authority, but he showed great patience and

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:26.139
reasonableness in listening to Abigail and having the good sense to know that

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:31.220
she was right. That's not always easy to do when the heat of the moment or when

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:36.860
we're upset. Perhaps you recall that our don't give up regional convention

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:42.940
last year. When discussing 2nd Peter chapter 1 verses 5 through 8, we learned a

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:46.940
nice formula that can help us to cultivate and strengthen Christian

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:55.299
qualities. We were encouraged to study them, meditate on them, and put them into

00:13:55.299 --> 00:14:00.220
practice. If we apply this formula with the qualities of patience and

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:05.740
reasonableness, it can help us to endure our trials successfully. And we're

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:10.779
confident that Jehovah will supply us with whatever power we need so that we

00:14:10.779 --> 00:14:18.340
will not tire out as we continue to endure and put our trust in him. In addition

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:22.340
to developing these qualities, something else that can help us is our spiritual

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:28.539
routine. Our consistent routine of study, meeting attendance, and the ministry

00:14:28.539 --> 00:14:36.220
will help us remain busy, stay active, and make good decisions. We'll have no

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:42.539
time to become curious or occupy what the things this world has to offer. It's

00:14:42.539 --> 00:14:47.059
good to remember the people during the days of Haggai. When the Jews lost

00:14:47.059 --> 00:14:52.100
their focus and started neglecting Jehovah's Temple, they lost his

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:58.899
blessing and protection spiritually. And what was the result? Well, notice

00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:04.580
how Haggai draws our attention to a different type of bag at Haggai chapter

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:14.940
1 verse 6. You have so much seed, but you harvest little. You eat, but it is not

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:21.700
to satisfaction. You drink, but you do not drink your fill. You put on clothing

00:15:22.259 --> 00:15:29.539
but no one gets warm. The one who hires himself out puts his wages in a bag full

00:15:29.539 --> 00:15:36.620
of holes. The Jews sowed seed but had a meager harvest. They lacked enough food

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:41.740
to satisfy their needs. They were unable to clothe themselves with warm garments.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:48.179
Because Jehovah withheld his blessings, Haggai rightly compared them to a man

00:15:48.179 --> 00:15:54.620
who puts his wages in a bag full of holes. Imagine the disappointment of

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:59.179
discovering that hard-earned wages had gradually disappeared through a leaking

00:15:59.179 --> 00:16:05.899
bag. Of course, our focus is not material prosperity because whether we have

00:16:05.899 --> 00:16:10.899
an abundance of material things or not, if we fail to receive Jehovah's

00:16:10.899 --> 00:16:19.139
blessing, our spirituality is jeopardized. So we must be determined to never lose

00:16:19.139 --> 00:16:26.059
our focus and keep Jehovah in the forefront of our lives. When we examine the

00:16:26.059 --> 00:16:31.700
life of David, it's evident that he enjoyed a preserved and protected

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:38.259
relationship with God. When we read the book of Psalms, take note of how David

00:16:38.299 --> 00:16:46.299
describes Jehovah's protective care. In Psalm 18, Psalm 31, and Psalm 34, as he

00:16:46.299 --> 00:16:53.139
went through distresses, just beautiful accounts. Now, did David always do

00:16:53.139 --> 00:16:59.460
everything the right way? No. Think of his encounter with naval. While his

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:06.619
angry reaction was understandable, his way of expressing it was not correct. But

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:11.660
David learned from his mistakes and each new trial that he went through

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:18.180
strengthened his relationship with Jehovah even more. For example, after the

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:23.859
ordeal with naval, a short time later, David married Abigail. They were still

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:29.099
fugitives, but he found a king that befriended them and gave David's men and

00:17:29.099 --> 00:17:35.579
family a land to dwell in. One day, while all the men were away, the amalachites

00:17:35.579 --> 00:17:41.259
raided and burned the city and carried off all the men's wives, children, and

00:17:41.259 --> 00:17:48.140
flocks. Upon returning and seeing what had happened, David and his men wept.

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:55.099
Grief quickly turned to bitterness, and David's men spoke of stoning him. This

00:17:55.099 --> 00:17:59.900
was likely quite stressful for David. He was concerned for the safety of his

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:05.500
family, and likely he was frustrated that his men had turned on him. Maybe

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:11.460
he felt disrespected again as he had with naval. So how would he handle this

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:19.980
situation? We get a glimpse of David's feelings at 1 Samuel, chapter 30, verse 6.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:28.099
David was very distressed because the men were talking of stoning him, for all

00:18:28.099 --> 00:18:33.779
the men had become very bitter over the loss of their sons and daughters. But

00:18:33.859 --> 00:18:42.740
notice how did David handle the situation? The verse continues, but David

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:52.660
strengthened himself by Jehovah his God. How did he do this? Verse 8 says, David

00:18:52.660 --> 00:19:00.019
inquired of Jehovah. This time, David has a different thought process and

00:19:00.019 --> 00:19:07.619
response. Immediately, he remembers to consult Jehovah. Isn't this a nice

00:19:07.619 --> 00:19:11.859
reminder that when you and I are going through difficult trials and situations,

00:19:12.579 --> 00:19:18.259
we want to immediately pray to Jehovah and seek his direction through the pages of

00:19:18.259 --> 00:19:24.019
his word, the Bible. This is essential for our spiritual protection.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:31.859
So in review, as we face difficult situations in life, may we look for

00:19:31.859 --> 00:19:37.140
opportunities to show and develop our Christian qualities, such as patience and

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:42.980
reasonableness. These qualities show Jehovah that we want to be like him, that we

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:47.700
have the mental disposition of Christ, and that we will allow him to guide us

00:19:48.019 --> 00:19:55.380
constantly. Next, may we keep focused and busy in the work of the Lord. By drawing

00:19:55.380 --> 00:20:01.619
close to Jehovah through prayer and engaging in spiritual activities, we make the best of

00:20:01.619 --> 00:20:08.420
our situation now. But we will also find everlasting protection in Jehovah's hands,

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:18.309
safely swaddled, and securely wrapped in his bag of life. We need to rely on Jehovah's

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:24.950
guidance even in the most severe trials. It's possible that you may face a life-threatening issue

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:31.509
where there's no desirable option, but a decision is necessary. In the following

00:20:31.509 --> 00:20:39.430
dramatization, Emma is faced with a situation like this. What will she do? And how will God's

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:48.569
word help her to make a decision? When Thomas and I first learned I was pregnant,

00:20:48.569 --> 00:21:03.990
we were both really shocked. But then we grew more and more excited. And we were so thrilled

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:14.569
when we saw our little girl for the first time. We really didn't care if it was a boy or a girl.

00:21:15.369 --> 00:21:36.619
We just wanted the baby to be healthy. Unfortunately, our hopes were completely destroyed when the

00:21:36.619 --> 00:21:42.619
doctor told us that the baby would likely be born with severe problems and could even die.

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:57.339
My husband and his parents are not Jehovah's witnesses, but they do feel abortion is wrong.

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:15.000
Still, they thought that we should listen to our doctor's advice. I couldn't believe this was

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:21.960
happening. I even questioned why Jehovah would allow it. I really felt it was more than I could

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:31.210
bear. Thomas asked me what I wanted to do, and I told him that I could never have an abortion.

00:22:32.089 --> 00:22:38.009
He agreed that normally it would be wrong, but felt that in our situation God would understand

00:22:42.869 --> 00:22:48.390
I was so overwhelmed. I was being pressured to make a decision I knew was wrong,

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:57.589
but that everyone was telling me was based on my child. I had never felt so alone.

00:23:00.519 --> 00:23:16.900
I needed Jehovah more than ever, so I poured out my heart to him in prayer. And then I did

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:57.829
research. I showed Thomas the scripture I had found. If men should struggle with each other

00:23:57.829 --> 00:24:07.259
and they hurt a pregnant woman, if a fatality does occur, then you must give life for life.

00:24:08.619 --> 00:24:14.700
Jehovah views even the unintentional killing of an unborn child as a serious sin.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:26.740
So how could we intentionally take the life of our child? I made my decision clear to our doctor.

00:24:30.579 --> 00:24:34.099
Thank you. I'll have a look at that later. And to my in-laws.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:43.559
There was a chance the diagnosis was incorrect, and I'd love to say that that's what occurred.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:49.799
But it did not. My daughter Chloe only loved a few weeks after she was born,

00:24:50.519 --> 00:24:56.519
and losing her was the hardest thing I've ever had to endure. But Jehovah gave me the courage

00:24:56.519 --> 00:25:03.160
to explain my beliefs to my husband, my in-laws, and the medical staff, and they all expressed

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:09.079
admiration for my strong faith. And I've never regretted the decision I made.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:15.880
Even though Chloe only loved those few weeks, I'm so grateful for the time I had with her.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:22.920
I know Jehovah remembers every detail about her, and he'll give her back to me in the resurrection,

00:25:23.559 --> 00:25:28.839
in perfect health, because all life is truly precious in his eyes.

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:39.700
Getting Jehovah's thinking on a matter should be the first thing we do when making decisions.

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:46.339
This is especially true when well-intentioned friends or family offer advice that may conflict

00:25:46.339 --> 00:25:53.140
with Bible principles. As we weigh a variety of options, follow Emma's good example of consulting

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:59.700
God's word in our Christian publications. This will help us make decisions that bring honor to Jehovah.

00:26:00.579 --> 00:26:06.980
In our program, we've seen a few ways that Satan will exert pressure on those securely

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:13.460
wrapped in the bag of life. True Christians courageously stand up to the devil, never allowing him to

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:19.779
pry us away from Jehovah's protection. At a recent Bethel morning worship, for the Mark Sanderson

00:26:19.779 --> 00:26:26.099
of the governing body discussed 1 Peter, chapter 5, verse 9, and outlined how we take our stand

00:26:26.099 --> 00:26:32.819
against Satan. Is it possible to survive the attack of a roaring lion?

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:40.579
Well now I did some just quick checking on various wildlife websites, and here's what they say.

00:26:40.579 --> 00:26:46.500
Basically, they all give the same advice if you're being attacked by a lion. They say,

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:56.980
hold your ground, never run, or turn back. In fact, one website says a lion can run 50 miles per

00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:06.099
hour, so stand still. If you run, you will only die tired. Well, that's true.

00:27:07.059 --> 00:27:17.460
1 Peter, chapter 5, and verse 9, gives us exactly the same advice. It says, take your stand against him.

00:27:18.339 --> 00:27:25.220
Well, in this case, not against a literal lion, but against that roaring lion, Satan the devil,

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:34.579
who is seeking to devour every single one of us. Our ability to stand firm when facing this lion,

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:43.539
to be able to oppose him, to refuse to be intimidated by him, to refuse to run away, or turn back,

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:50.420
requires what the Apostle Peter next mentions there in verse 9, a brother crane, so nicely covered

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:59.859
in his comment. We have to take our stand against him firm in the faith. To be successful, we

00:27:59.859 --> 00:28:07.539
must have complete trust and complete confidence in Jehovah. Well, now, in that regard,

00:28:07.539 --> 00:28:13.539
let's look at an example of someone in Bible times who had that kind of confidence in Jehovah.

00:28:14.339 --> 00:28:21.539
This is in the days of King Jehoshaphat, when Judah was threatened by the combined forces of Moab,

00:28:22.099 --> 00:28:28.019
Ammon, and the inhabitants of the mountainous region of Seer. Now, let's begin by opening our

00:28:28.019 --> 00:28:37.619
Bibles and reading 2 Chronicles chapter 20 and verse 12. So here, Jehoshaphat is praying to Jehovah.

00:28:37.619 --> 00:28:45.299
He's pouring out his heart to him and see what he says. Oh, our God, will you not execute judgment

00:28:45.299 --> 00:28:53.299
on them? For we are powerless before this large crowd that is coming against us. And we do not know

00:28:53.299 --> 00:29:02.500
what we should do, but our eyes are toward you. Well, Jehoshaphat was facing the lion.

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:12.740
He said to Jehovah, we don't know what to do, but Jehoshaphat had complete and total trust. He had

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:19.460
firm faith in Jehovah. Well, what did Jehovah tell Jehoshaphat to do? See, verse 17,

00:29:19.619 --> 00:29:29.859
you will not need to fight this battle. Take your position. Does that sound familiar? Take your position,

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:39.380
stand still and see the salvation of Jehovah in your behalf. Oh, Judah and Jerusalem do not be afraid

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:46.980
or be terrified. Tomorrow, go out against them and Jehovah will be with you. Well, what did

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:53.859
Jehovah tell them to do? He said, take a position in opposition to that military force,

00:29:53.859 --> 00:30:00.900
stand firm, refuse to run away and see the salvation that will come from Jehovah.

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:09.220
Well, in order to do that, Jehoshaphat and the people with him would need to have strong, firm,

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:15.539
solid faith. Well, not to help the people. Look at what Jehoshaphat said to them,

00:30:15.539 --> 00:30:21.059
as they were getting ready for this battle in verse 20. You see just about middle of the verse.

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:29.140
It says, Jehoshaphat stood up and said, listen to me, Oh, Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem.

00:30:30.019 --> 00:30:39.140
Put faith in Jehovah your God so that you may be able to stand firm. Put faith in his prophets

00:30:39.779 --> 00:30:47.140
and you will be successful. Well, that's exactly what happened. See, with that kind of confidence

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:54.500
in Jehovah, with that firm trust in him, with that standing firm, what did Jehovah do? Well,

00:30:54.500 --> 00:31:00.339
according to verses 22 and 23, you'll remember what happened. The men of Ammon, Moab and the

00:31:00.339 --> 00:31:08.019
inhabitants of the mountainous region of Seer, they all went to striking down one another. And

00:31:08.019 --> 00:31:14.259
in verse 23 says, and the Ammonites and the Moabites turned against the inhabitants of the

00:31:14.259 --> 00:31:20.500
mountainous region of Seer to destroy and annihilate them. And when they finished with the inhabitants

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:30.019
of Seer, they helped to destroy one another. Well, Jehovah had rewarded their firm faith in him.

00:31:30.019 --> 00:31:35.619
The weapons that had been formed against Jehoshaphat and his people had no success.

00:31:36.019 --> 00:31:43.220
Well, now, sometimes we think, of course, that these kinds of situations only happened in Bible

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:50.579
times, but it's amazing to see how our brothers in our modern day have had that same kind of faith

00:31:50.579 --> 00:31:57.299
and have stood firm against the lion. Here's just a couple of experiences that really touch my heart.

00:31:57.619 --> 00:32:06.339
Here's one about a brother named Pavel from Russia. In 1958, Pavel was arrested for religious

00:32:06.339 --> 00:32:11.779
activities. Accompanying me to the train, he says, the officer with me said,

00:32:12.579 --> 00:32:19.220
look at your wife for the last time because you will never see her again while there's the lion.

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:26.339
I spent six months in solitary confinement before my trial. During interrogations,

00:32:26.579 --> 00:32:35.380
the investigators did everything to undermine my faith. Sometimes violence was used. I begged Jehovah to

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:43.059
give me the strength to stay firm, but now look what happened. During a routine interrogation,

00:32:43.779 --> 00:32:50.259
the investigator called me into his study and he said, now we will show you what your organization

00:32:50.339 --> 00:32:56.900
is doing, then you can see if it is God's work or not. Looking at me intently, he continued.

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:06.579
This year, your convention in New York was attended by 253,000 people in two stadiums. The

00:33:06.579 --> 00:33:14.259
convention lasted eight days. The investigators screwed the table with photographs. In one of them,

00:33:14.259 --> 00:33:20.339
I saw happy delegates and colorful native dress embracing one another. Another photo showed

00:33:20.339 --> 00:33:29.380
brother nor giving a talk and yet others showed the baptism. The investigator could not even imagine

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:35.140
what I was feeling at that moment. I felt that I was attending the convention without ever

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:43.460
having leaving the prison. I felt new strength flooding into me. It was just what I needed.

00:33:44.099 --> 00:33:51.380
And Jehovah generously blessed me in a special way. I was ready to endure further. Isn't that

00:33:51.380 --> 00:34:00.180
amazing? Here's another similar experience. 1960, also in Russia, a large publicized trial of

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:06.339
Jehovah's Witnesses. About 300 persons were present in the courtroom, including many of our brothers

00:34:06.339 --> 00:34:13.860
and sisters. Well, as the evidence, as evidence against the brothers, the prosecutor decided to

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:19.539
present a letter from Nathan H. Norr. One of the brothers who attended the trials had this.

00:34:20.659 --> 00:34:26.500
The prosecutor loudly began to read a letter that had been intercepted by the KGB from

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:33.059
brother norr to the brothers in the Soviet Union. For all of us witnesses present in the hall,

00:34:33.059 --> 00:34:37.380
it was a wonderful gift from Jehovah. The letter warmed our hearts.

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:44.260
We heard wise counsel from the Bible and encouragement to serve our fellow believers lovingly

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:51.940
and to stay faithful even under trials. The prosecutor read the letter from beginning to the very

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:58.579
end. We listened with wrapped attention. It seemed to us that we were attending a convention.

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:06.409
When our brothers, what additional lessons do we learn from these two experiences?

00:35:07.769 --> 00:35:15.289
When we stand our ground against Satan, firm in the faith, then Jehovah will do just what he

00:35:15.289 --> 00:35:23.449
promised in 1 Peter 5 and 10. Do you see what it says there? But after you have suffered a little

00:35:23.449 --> 00:35:30.409
while, the God of all undeserved kindness who called you to his everlasting glory and union with

00:35:30.409 --> 00:35:39.210
Christ will himself finish your training. He will make you firm. He will make you strong. He will

00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:50.730
firmly ground you. So, brothers, can we survive the attack of a roaring lion? Absolutely. With firm

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:56.730
faith, let's stand fast and see the salvation from Jehovah.

00:35:58.489 --> 00:36:04.570
Burm faith is needed to resist the relentless attacks of Satan the devil. The modern day examples

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:12.250
brought out in the presentation are truly inspiring. However, did you notice that Brother Sanderson

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:19.929
also applied the biblical example of Jahashafat? The Bible is full of accounts that can revive and

00:36:19.929 --> 00:36:28.570
renew our courage every time we read them. But here's a question. When should we develop the type

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:34.409
of faith that can resist the attack of a roaring lion? Is there something only longtime servants of

00:36:34.409 --> 00:36:43.929
Jehovah can do? Ecclesiastes 121 says to remember then your grand creator in the days of your youth.

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:52.730
Young ones, do you find it a challenge to read the Bible every day? A few of your peers have

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:57.929
excellent suggestions based on how they do their Bible reading and how they get the most benefit

00:36:57.929 --> 00:37:06.840
from it. I often put it off until later, so I come home in the evening tired and like to relax.

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:11.960
I was very often tired for many different reasons and that is why I didn't have the motivation

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:17.480
even to start Bible reading in the first place. I also had many phases where it was really tough

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:23.719
to stick it out with Bible reading. Especially in the age of social media, there are many other things

00:37:23.719 --> 00:37:31.320
you can fill your day with. One hobby that mainly got in the way was watching movies. I really

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:35.639
spent a lot of time on that. This often seals precious time you could have made better use of.

00:37:36.039 --> 00:37:42.599
So something that moved me was the thought that through Bible reading you're actually talking to

00:37:42.599 --> 00:37:49.320
Jehovah, that you pray to him and he is the nuts ring you through the Bible. As Jehovah promised

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:54.119
that he can give us both the power and the desire to act, I just pray to Jehovah to please first

00:37:54.119 --> 00:38:02.199
give me the power to read and then the desire follows. Then I decided to simply start and stick with

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:06.840
it. I started with reading my favourite book and that way it was easier for me.

00:38:08.519 --> 00:38:11.960
Well I started with Genesis just to get through the whole Bible.

00:38:13.559 --> 00:38:19.000
My favourite Bible book is Esther and because I think she was a very special person,

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.840
it was especially then that I could imagine what her situation was like and what kind of a person

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:31.719
she was and I could see myself in the account. The weekly Bible reading program has been such a

00:38:31.719 --> 00:38:36.599
guideline. It's motivating since we discussed this content at the meetings and I could use the

00:38:36.599 --> 00:38:41.719
study aids in our workbook too. You can better relate to the brothers and sisters comments because

00:38:41.719 --> 00:38:48.039
you've read the material yourself and I can comment too. When I'm reading the Bible in the JW

00:38:48.039 --> 00:38:54.199
Library app on my phone there is of course the risk that it vibrates and I get a message and then

00:38:54.199 --> 00:38:59.559
of course you have the urge to check to see who just wrote me. For me personally then it's really

00:38:59.639 --> 00:39:05.000
helpful when I put my phone in airplane mode so that I can really focus on what I'm reading and

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:13.190
nothing can distract me. I like reading at home but I also like to do outdoors because I think that's

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:19.670
where you're closest to Jehovah. I never just read about the events that are described in the Bible

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:25.030
but I ask myself questions like why did Jehovah have this written down? What is in there for me

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:30.789
personally and this helps me to stay focused and not just scratch the surface otherwise my mind would

00:39:30.789 --> 00:39:36.869
immediately start wondering. At a convention I learned something that helps me to really take

00:39:36.869 --> 00:39:41.829
in the things I read. The point discussed was to remember to look in four different directions when

00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:49.269
meditating so to speak. First to look upwards to find out exactly what I am learning from the text

00:39:49.269 --> 00:39:56.789
about Jehovah. Then downwards to find out what it teaches me about his purpose, about what he

00:39:56.789 --> 00:40:04.630
wants for the earth. Then to look at myself how I can personally benefit now and eventually towards

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:11.909
others thinking about how I can help other people with this particular Bible text. In the JW Library

00:40:11.909 --> 00:40:18.389
app there are four different colours for highlighting text so I simply use a different colour for

00:40:18.389 --> 00:40:26.489
each of the four directions and highlight them on my tablet or smartphone. For example one of my

00:40:26.489 --> 00:40:31.849
hobbies is drawing. I decided one time that I was going to draw the spiritual suit of armor,

00:40:31.849 --> 00:40:37.210
all of its different parts and their symbolic meanings and this especially helped me to actually

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:43.050
see the benefit of it. To see how many wonderful resources Jehovah provides us with and that he never

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:49.530
leaves us alone. Another thing I like very much is the category Bible study activities where you can

00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:55.449
directly pick a topic that you personally find interesting and then to read that. It's Jehovah's

00:40:55.929 --> 00:41:00.650
word. I love him and also want to please him of course. That's why it's very important to understand

00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:05.849
his word. It feels really good when you've understood a difficult phrase by doing it this way.

00:41:05.849 --> 00:41:11.050
It actually makes you feel like you've achieved something and this brings you a lot closer to Jehovah.

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:18.889
It happens often that you don't even know what you should pray about or what you could thank Jehovah for.

00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:24.250
My personal Bible reading has helped me with this a lot because now I know exactly what I want to

00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:31.210
tell Jehovah. Daily Bible reading is very important to me as it gives me some sort of inner balance when

00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:37.849
I face situations that might be unfamiliar or shape me up. I know that no matter what the problem is,

00:41:37.849 --> 00:41:44.949
Jehovah has always the right answer prepared. At the beginning it is really hard. You have to fight

00:41:44.949 --> 00:41:51.349
to keep it up and you definitely need discipline. After a while you truly start to enjoy it and it

00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:56.949
gets easier and easier and you're happy that you started in the first place. I really think that

00:41:56.949 --> 00:42:02.869
when Jehovah sees how much effort you put into it that he's genuinely proud of you and that's

00:42:02.869 --> 00:42:18.010
the best thing that can happen to you. These young brothers and sisters didn't just acquire knowledge.

00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:23.690
They drew closer to Jehovah. This will help them build a fine foundation for their future

00:42:24.409 --> 00:42:30.329
and you can too. It may not be easy at first but as one young brother suggested,

00:42:30.969 --> 00:42:37.530
start with something that captures your interest. Try using the JW Library app or a handy notebook

00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:43.530
to keep track of points you hope to apply or discuss at family worship. This will make it a part of

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:50.489
your daily routine that you look forward to. Each segment in the program has highlighted some way

00:42:50.489 --> 00:42:56.570
we can build a strong relationship with God. Our music video depicts the joy of marriage where

00:42:56.570 --> 00:43:04.170
Jehovah is part of a threefold court, one that cannot quickly be torn apart. The song is called

00:43:04.809 --> 00:43:06.170
Truly in Love.

00:43:20.409 --> 00:43:49.289
That comes from a lovely gift called Gantubeet as one then no time has begun. It's simple so

00:43:49.289 --> 00:45:51.420
and it's something we know with a threefold Jehovah to guide us in a flesh search and exit.

00:45:51.420 --> 00:47:30.739
So many of our brothers and sisters can agree with the words of that song with a threefold

00:47:30.739 --> 00:47:39.780
court love will grow. In marriage, in youth, really in all things we've considered,

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:47.460
Jehovah will be there to guide us. What will be the result? We'll find the warmth and security

00:47:48.179 --> 00:47:55.510
of being securely wrapped in Jehovah's bag of life. We hope you enjoyed our program.

00:47:56.469 --> 00:48:01.989
We conclude by heading to the beautiful tropical island of Sri Lanka off the southeast coast of

00:48:01.989 --> 00:48:09.750
India in the Indian Ocean. Over 6,000 publishers make up the 112 congregations on the island,

00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:16.789
including 13 isolated groups. As you travel throughout the country, the scars of decades-long

00:48:16.789 --> 00:48:23.110
civil war are still evident. However, our brothers and sisters display the beautiful spirit of

00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:29.349
Christian unity. Publishers preach the good news to those on the coast, high in the mountains,

00:48:30.789 --> 00:48:36.230
and in the bustling cities. More than 8,000 Bible studies are being conducted,

00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:42.309
and over 650 brothers and sisters are in the pioneer work. Due to the dense population in the

00:48:42.309 --> 00:48:49.989
city of Colombo, those in metropolitan witnessing see an average of almost 17,000 people in just one

00:48:49.989 --> 00:48:57.750
eight-hour period. High in Sri Lanka's tea mountains is a small congregation in the town of Badula.

00:48:58.789 --> 00:49:03.590
Their productive ministry takes them into banana plantations, jungles,

00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:07.670
and mountain-tea states as they search for those receptive to the good news.

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:15.670
Despite differing ethnic backgrounds, they're completely united in worship and brotherly affection.

00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:19.590
Our brothers and sisters, who are wrapped up in Jehovah's bag of life,

00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:23.349
send you their warm love and greetings from the mountain tops of Sri Lanka.

00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:28.710
Thank you for watching. From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:37.429
this is J.W. Broadcasting.
