00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:02.899
Help!

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:09.779
No doubt you have sometimes in your life heard somebody call out, help!

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:14.259
Perhaps you yourself have called out, help to Jehovah.

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:17.620
In Psalm 30 verse 10, David once sang,

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.019
Oh, Jehovah, become my helper.

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.940
Jehovah becomes our helper not only when we are in danger.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:32.820
He provides help in many positive ways in everyday life.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.820
What helped us Jehovah provide for us?

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.659
First, find with me a revelation chapter 14 verse 6.

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:50.259
For one thing, Jehovah provides his holy angels to support the worldwide preaching work.

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:55.100
In Revelation 146, John recorded.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.979
And I saw another angel flying in mid-Heaven and he had ever lasting good news to declare

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:10.680
to those who dwell on the earth to every nation and tribe and tongue and people.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.519
It is not just one angel that is active in support of the preaching work.

00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:19.159
Many angels are involved in it.

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.760
If it were not for the help and direction of the angels, we would sometimes overlook

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.920
somebody with a good heart when we go out and preach.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.359
Secondly, Jehovah has also given us his holy spirit, the fruitage of which makes us more

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:43.519
effective teachers and helps us to draw sheep like ones to the truth.

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:48.280
Thirdly, Jehovah has given us as help the privilege of prayer.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.560
He gets personally involved in our activities,

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:56.359
Bible teachers and students alike need Jehovah's help.

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:59.239
Psalm 127 verse 1 says,

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:06.480
unless Jehovah builds the house, it is in vain that its builders work hard on it.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.000
Fourth, Jehovah gives us also the needed wisdom.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.560
It is wisdom to pray for the wisdom from above mentioned at James 3 verse 17.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.360
Lastly, Jehovah also gives us the needed strength which helps us a lot when we are tired

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.000
or discouraged or have a lot of work.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
First, Peter 4.11 refers to the strength that God supplies.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.879
Yes, we can pray for Jehovah's help for wisdom and for the necessary strength.

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:58.969
In the following dramatization, notice the power of praying in behalf of a Bible student.

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:03.689
So, how do we know that Jesus did not become king when he was on earth

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:10.189
or immediately after he was resurrected?

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:16.319
Oh, because he didn't.

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.949
Well, what did Jesus teach his disciples to pray?

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:26.310
Oh, yeah, well, I know the obvious.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.509
Let your kingdom come, implied future tense.

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:37.419
But how come you know for sure what's going on in heaven?

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:44.180
Maybe it would help if we reviewed the sighted scriptures here.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.659
Before you leave, a suggestion.

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:50.740
Maybe if you were to study ahead of time, I would...

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.740
How about no?

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.340
I'm really swamped.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.699
I know you're busy.

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:56.699
We all are.

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:58.860
You have no clue, do you?

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:07.449
I gotta go.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.169
I didn't know what to do next.

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:21.540
I thought she was making our study a priority, but maybe she wasn't.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:50.500
Do all die time.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:05:08.149
Then, I remembered first Corinthians 3, verse 6, that God keeps making it grow.

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:35.459
So I asked him to help Jade, then left it with him.

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:39.329
Look, I need to apologize.

00:05:39.329 --> 00:05:40.730
Forget it.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.290
You were stressed.

00:05:42.329 --> 00:05:44.649
Yeah, but there's more.

00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:47.410
Inside, I knew you were right.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.529
It's just the last thing I wanted to stop.

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:54.889
Really?

00:05:54.889 --> 00:06:08.610
How about I show you how I prepare?

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:18.819
Okay.

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:23.379
How can prayer help us in making disciples?

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:31.750
Please locate with me Philippians 1, verses 9 and 10.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:38.149
And this is what I continue praying that your love may abound still more and more,

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:46.509
with accurate knowledge and full discernment, that you may make sure of the more important things

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:53.480
so that you may be flawless and not stumbling others up to the day of Christ.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:59.879
Just as Paul prayed that the love of the Philippians may abound with accurate knowledge and

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:06.079
full discernment, we can pray for the same in behalf of our Bible students.

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:12.879
Pray also for the Holy Spirit to guide your thoughts and actions and the ones of your students.

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:17.360
Pray from the heart, confident that your hope will hear you.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:26.279
Psalm 65 verse 2 says, O hero of prayer, to you people of all sorts will come.

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:33.720
Teach your Bible students how to pray, not only encourage them to do so, urge them to do so.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:39.720
Meaning to pray will help your students to form a close friendship with Jehovah.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:46.759
Pray with your Bible students and for them, using or spelling out their name.

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:52.519
Be confident that Jehovah will answer your prayers and theirs.

00:07:52.519 --> 00:07:57.279
Please turn to Acts 10 verse 9.

00:07:57.279 --> 00:08:03.759
Peter was a fine example of one who prayed.

00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:09.579
Acts 10 verse 9 says,

00:08:09.579 --> 00:08:14.139
The next day as they were continuing on their journey and were approaching the city,

00:08:14.139 --> 00:08:21.699
Peter went up to the house top about the six hour to pray.

00:08:21.699 --> 00:08:26.180
In the same chapter, Cornelius was also a fine example.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:33.620
In Acts chapter 10, 30 and 31, he reported to Peter.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:39.460
Four days ago, counting from this hour, I was praying in my house at the ninth hour,

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:43.980
just in a man in bright clothing stood in front of me and said,

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:53.750
Cornelius, your prayer has been favorably heard and your gifts of mercy have been remembered before God.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:58.830
Jehovah answered Peter's prayer and Cornelius prayer.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:05.750
Jehovah has given us what we need to increase our joy in making disciples.

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:10.149
When a report came to John that Jesus was making many disciples,

00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:12.789
John did not become jealous.

00:09:12.789 --> 00:09:15.149
A John chapter 3, he replied,

00:09:15.149 --> 00:09:18.789
This joy of mine has been made full.

00:09:18.789 --> 00:09:25.149
That one must go on increasing, but I must go on decreasing.

00:09:25.149 --> 00:09:31.870
When we do not make disciples personally, we can still rejoice with those who do make them.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:37.309
The angels rejoice, although they do not personally make disciples.

00:09:37.309 --> 00:09:40.110
At Luke 157, Jesus said,

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:42.909
There will be more joy in heaven,

00:09:42.909 --> 00:09:50.590
or the one sinner who repents than over 99 righteous ones who have no need of repentance.

00:09:50.629 --> 00:09:58.190
We also rejoice because we have the Bible and powerful research tools in print and electronically,

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:01.470
as well as in audio format.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:06.429
We rejoice because we have our brotherhood to support and assist us.

00:10:06.429 --> 00:10:11.549
We can ask them for suggestions and we can invite them to accompany us in the ministry,

00:10:11.549 --> 00:10:17.149
even if it is only by computer, tie-in or telephone witnessing.

00:10:17.149 --> 00:10:21.149
If we cannot meet together physically for a congregation meeting,

00:10:21.149 --> 00:10:25.950
we can arrange for tie-ins with others, and here and see them.

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:28.909
It warms our heart.

00:10:28.909 --> 00:10:34.509
Don't forget the provisions from Jehovah, which we mentioned at the beginning of this talk.

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:38.509
First, we have the privilege of prayer.

00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:41.870
Second, the help of God's angels.

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:46.029
Third, the support of the Holy Spirit.

00:10:46.029 --> 00:10:48.590
Fourth, the wisdom from above.

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:54.669
And fifth, the spiritual and emotional strength that God supplies.

00:10:54.669 --> 00:11:01.470
Jehovah has given us all of this because he cares about us and about those we teach.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:08.029
We will have great joy in the ministry if we take full advantage of Jehovah's help.

00:11:08.029 --> 00:11:13.549
Lastly, we want to mention something very precious that brings us deep inner joy.

00:11:13.549 --> 00:11:16.429
Some 25, 14.

00:11:16.429 --> 00:11:24.669
Close friendship with Jehovah belongs to those who fear him and pray to him.

00:11:24.669 --> 00:11:35.470
May your joyous friendship with Jehovah and the joyous friendship with disciples of Jehovah last for an eternity.
