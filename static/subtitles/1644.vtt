Jehovah invites each of us to dig into his word and draw closer to him.

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:24.539
That's why we're convinced that Jehovah is blessing the ongoing work to improve our study tools.

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:33.539
It was in 2013, for example, that the organization released an exciting new tool, J.W. Library,

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:42.539
a digital library with the Bible, publications, audio, and video that goes where we go.

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:52.539
The writing committee of the governing body directs and approves updates to J.W. Library, including new and improved features.

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:58.539
After an update, we might not notice a new feature or know how to take full advantage of it.

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:07.540
So we asked the brothers who worked with the programming of J.W. Library to show us how we can make the best use of it.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:17.540
Have you ever tried to help someone find a publication or media file in J.W. Library, but had to explain how to get their step-by-step?

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.540
Now you can send a link using the share feature.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:33.569
If the recipient has the app installed, when he clicks on the link, it will open directly in the app.

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:38.569
If he doesn't have the app, it will open on the J.W.org website.

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:45.569
We've all had trouble trying to remember a point related to a scripture from a recent talk or a Bible reading.

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:47.569
Tap a Bible verse.

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:52.569
Create a new note, enter text in the note in the study pane.

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:58.459
Try this. Make some notes directly in your Bible.

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:06.459
The next time you're repairing a talk or conducting a Bible study, those explanations or illustrations will be right at your fingertips.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:13.460
Do you ever wish there was an easier way to look up scriptures while taking notes in J.W. Library?

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.460
Full screen notes were made for just that reason.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.460
Tap the note from the personal study tab to open it in full screen.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.460
Then minimize the note to look up a scripture.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.460
When you are finished reading the verse, you'll notice just one tap away.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:39.460
When in full screen, the note is automatically in edit mode, so you can start typing immediately.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.460
While we have a note open, let's talk about tags.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:51.020
A good tag identifies what the note is about and helps you find the note again.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:57.020
A tag can really be anything that would help you find this gem in the future.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:07.020
Some like to make tags for family worship topics, illustrations they want to remember, or reminders to dig deeper at a later time.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:13.020
And you can use emojis in your notes and tags to make them stand out.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:22.020
When you are in the app, do you ever wish you could start listening to audio recordings at a specific verse instead of starting at the beginning of the chapter?

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.020
Now you can.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:32.270
Tap a Bible verse number. Then tap the play button.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:45.310
This also works in other publications, like the Watch Stower and the Material We're Studying in the Congregation Bible Study.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.310
Are you planning on getting a new device? You don't have to worry about losing your notes and highlights.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.310
Use the backup and restore feature to save your notes.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:10.699
You can backup to a cloud service or email the file to yourself and then restore it to your new device.

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:16.699
And if you just want to keep your notes safe, remember to make a backup regularly, maybe once a week.

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:27.699
Some have JW Library on more than one device. They use one device to take notes, then send a backup from there to other devices.

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:34.699
Note that when you restore a backup and a second device, it will replace any notes you have there.

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:39.699
We encourage you to learn to use the features of JW Library well.

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:47.699
It will help you to find and dress you up with them from Jehovah and teach others how to do the same.

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:53.699
Thank you, brothers, for those excellent tips on how to get the most from JW Library.

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.699
I know I'll be able to put many of them to good use.

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:04.699
If JW Library is one of your study tools, we encourage you to become skilled with it.

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:15.699
While you don't have to use every feature of JW Library, you can learn and practice the ones that help you study God's Word and teach others.

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:24.699
The major Jehovah continued to bless us as we make every effort to dig into His Word and draw closer to Him.
