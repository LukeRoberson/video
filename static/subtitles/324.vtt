00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:06.879
Let's open our Bibles and read the text directly from the Bible because there's more to it.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:19.519
Genesis 24 and verse 67. And as we read this, what we're looking for is a clue into Isaac's

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:27.519
personality. Let's see what we can find out about Isaac from verse 67. It says, after that,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.359
Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah, his mother. Thus he took Rebecca as his wife,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:46.079
and he fell in love with her, and Isaac found comfort after the loss of his mother.

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:56.000
So what clue do we have into Isaac's personality? He's obviously a man who has feelings.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:06.159
This is a man of sentiment. Now how long had Sarah been dead when Isaac got married?

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:18.879
Do the math. Sarah was 90 when Isaac was born. She was 127 when she died, so how old was Isaac when

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:30.640
Sarah died? 37. Now he's 40. Three years have passed, and his sorrow is so great that the

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.840
Bible makes special mention of the fact that he found comfort over the death of his mother.

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:47.519
So Sarah's death obviously hit Isaac hard. And then it says that he fell in love with his wife.

00:01:47.519 --> 00:01:54.719
Now how would the writer of Genesis know all this? Obviously Isaac shared his feelings,

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:03.040
unlike some men. Now from what we know of Rebecca, we can easily understand why Isaac would fall

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.919
in love with her. Brother Verges referred briefly to the situation that brought them together.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:15.520
Remember the oldest servant of Abraham? They think it was Ellie Yeezer, and for simplicity we'll

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:25.039
call him Ellie Yeezer. Abraham asks Ellie Yeezer to go to the city of Nehor to pick out a wife

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:30.960
for Isaac. Now Ellie Yeezer doesn't lean on his own discernment, his own judgment.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:40.719
He prays to Jehovah and he asks Jehovah for help. And he says now the woman who offers not only

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:48.400
to give me a drink, but who is willing to water my ten camels, let her be the one whom you have chosen

00:02:48.400 --> 00:03:01.840
for Isaac. And so he makes the trip to the city of Nehor. Enter Rebecca. She has a water jar on her

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:10.000
shoulder. And she not only offers to give Ellie Yeezer a drink, but she also offers to water his

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:19.439
ten camels. Now think about what's involved. Let's turn to Genesis 24 and read verses 19 and 20.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:30.500
Genesis 24, 19 and 20. When she finished giving him a drink, she said,

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:41.300
I will also draw water for your camels until they are done drinking. So she quickly emptied her jar

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:48.900
into the drinking trough and ran again and again to the well to draw water. And she kept

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:58.340
drawing water for all his camels. Easy to read. Not so easy to do. Now researchers tell us

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:06.099
that a camel can drink 25 gallons of water. Now let's be careful with our figures here.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:13.460
Does that mean that Rebecca drew 25 times 10 or 250 gallons for those camels?

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:22.019
Not necessarily. A camel has good mileage. You can get 40 or 50 miles of the gallon from a camel.

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:29.620
And so it's possible that the camels made that 500 mile journey on five or six gallons of water.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:37.620
But even if that was so, 50 or 60 gallons is still a lot of water. Now Ellie Yeezer had men with

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.980
him. And she could have said, well I'll draw water for you and your men can help themselves

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:49.300
to the water after all their servants. I'm not. But she didn't. So what do we learn about her?

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:57.300
She was a hard worker. Now you and I would have been ready for a nap after drawing all that water.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:03.220
But now she's a hospitable woman. She offers straw for the camels and a place for the men

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:11.540
to spend the night. So what do we learn about her? We learn that she is a hard worker and she is warm

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:19.620
and hospitable. What do we learn about Isaac? He's a warm man of sentiment. What about the camels?

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:28.339
Well, when we used to look for types and anti-types, we thought that the 10 camels pictured the perfect

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:35.860
word of God. And just as the camels brought Rebecca to Isaac, so the word of God brings the bride to

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:43.220
Christ. A couple of problems with that. First of all, the camel is an unclean animal. And you

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.420
wouldn't think that Jehovah would select an unclean animal to picture his perfect word.

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:54.180
And then if the camels picture the perfect word of God, you'd think that it would be the camels

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:00.339
that would bring water to Rebecca and not the other way around. So it seems that the camels

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:08.990
are just camels. Well, the day after Al-Eezer arrives, he asks Rebecca if she's willing to return

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:17.870
to Bir Shiba. Now, as we mentioned, that's a 500 mile journey on a camel. How long would it take?

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:25.470
These are not your speedy roadster camels. There are speedy camels that can do about 100 miles a day,

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:33.550
but these would be the slow, burden-bearing, Arabian camels, and they can do about 25 miles a day.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:41.069
So you're looking at a 20-day journey on a camel. How would you like to meet your

00:06:41.149 --> 00:06:49.149
fiancÃ©e for the first time after you'd traveled 20 days on a camel? Well, Rebecca was no pushover.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:58.110
She was a strong woman. When Esau and Jacob were born, Jehovah had said that the older Esau was

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:04.509
going to serve the younger Jacob. But remember what happened when Isaac thought he was about to die?

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:12.670
He wanted to bless the older Esau and Rebecca took action so that Jacob got the blessing. Now,

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:19.629
whether she was fully aware of it or not, that fit into Jehovah's purpose. So we're thinking of

00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:28.829
warm, sentimental, Isaac, and a strong, hard-working, smart, hospitable woman. What a wonderful

00:07:28.829 --> 00:07:35.550
combination that made. And it makes us think of how many Rebecca's we have in the organization

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:42.750
today. Some of them are working in construction. Others are working in Bethel. Others in the field.

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:49.149
They're willing to learn new languages and to serve with a need is great. They're hard workers.

00:07:49.149 --> 00:07:55.709
They're willing to do whatever is required and even go beyond the call of duty. They're hospitable,

00:07:55.709 --> 00:08:11.069
smart, attractive. Our sisters make an amazing contribution to Bethel. What would we do without them?
