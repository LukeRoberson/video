00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:06.839
I was arrested and sentenced to two and a half years in prison for my neutrality.

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.839
The surroundings in prison were unfamiliar and overwhelming.

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:15.839
I didn't know anyone and I didn't know what to expect from them.

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.839
I was the only witness.

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:25.269
I was continually praying to Jehovah for power and strength

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.269
to be able to resolve any problems in a peaceful manner

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:30.269
and withstand any difficulties.

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.270
In that situation only prayer and God's word brought me comfort.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.270
But then my Bible was taken away from me.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.270
It was returned to me though sometime later.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.270
I was allowed to have literature on one condition that I would not preach.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:52.270
True, preaching wasn't allowed, but that didn't mean I wasn't allowed to speak, did it?

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:58.270
I was determined that no matter what happened, I would remain faithful.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.270
My good conduct had a positive effect on the other prisoners.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.269
Some of them started reading the Bible.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.269
Quite often I couldn't even get my turn to read it.

00:01:10.269 --> 00:01:14.269
I didn't swear and I kept myself physically clean.

00:01:14.269 --> 00:01:17.269
This didn't go unnoticed by the prison officials.

00:01:17.269 --> 00:01:19.269
One day they said to me,

00:01:19.269 --> 00:01:22.269
because you are morally and physically clean,

00:01:22.269 --> 00:01:26.159
we want you to be our head cook.

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.159
That's how I became their chef.

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.400
I constantly saw evidence of Jehovah's hand.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.400
The ministry was amazing.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.400
There were months when I served up to 120 hours.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.400
I placed more than 100 pieces of literature.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.400
Thanks to Jehovah, I was able to stay in full-time ministry the whole time I was in prison.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.400
This filled my heart with joy.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.400
The thought at 1 Peter 5.9, which says that the entire association of brothers

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.400
is experiencing the same kind of suffering I was, strengthened me.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.400
I am confident that no matter what circumstances we find ourselves in,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.400
no matter who is around us, Jehovah will never abandon us.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.400
The day for my release finally arrived.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.400
It was a complete surprise for my mother.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.919
I hadn't told her.

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:27.919
I will never forget that moment when we were reunited.
