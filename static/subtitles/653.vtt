00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:07.540
In 1891, Charles Taze Russell visited Kishnell Moldova and he found one

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.119
kingdom proclaimer. If you were to visit Moldova today, you would find some

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:19.780
20,000 active publishers of the good news. Moldova has a rich spiritual

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.059
heritage that includes enduring faithfully under adverse conditions. Although

00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:28.219
governmental authorities tried to stop the spreading of the good news by

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:33.859
exiling thousands of our brothers to Siberia, to their dismay, all they did

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:39.710
was help bring the truth to one of the farthest corners of the earth. As the

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.229
following two experiences show, it seems that governmental authorities never

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:49.670
seem to learn. These experiences take place in a break-away state in the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.590
eastern region of Moldova that has been trying to ban our work for the past

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:00.869
17 years. One day this last summer, two sisters using a mobile display in the

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:04.629
capital of this region were approached by the city prosecutor and four of her

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.750
colleagues who started to interrogate them. This commotion attracted the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.310
attention of all the passers-by. One woman, not realizing what was going on,

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.390
thought the entire group was made up of Jehovah's Witnesses and thanked all

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.109
present for the literature display, saying how nice it was that people could now

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:30.780
choose their own literature. Another woman, who was perusing the literature,

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.540
overheard what was going on and addressing those from the prosecutor's office

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.260
as though speaking to children, said, why don't you leave them alone? They're

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.980
doing a good work and aren't causing any problems. I live in a crime-infested

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.939
neighborhood and you haven't done a thing about that, but you won't leave these

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:55.060
good people in peace. During that one-hour interrogation, 12 books and eight

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:02.969
magazines were placed. In another city, in the same region, two other sisters

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.010
were using a mobile literature display and were taken to the police station to

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.090
be questioned by the chief of police. As he wasn't in yet, they were told to wait

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.650
at the entrance to the building. These two courageous sisters decided to set up

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.930
their display cart. One woman, thinking the police had arranged for the

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.129
literature display cart, approached the sisters asking honest-hearted questions.

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.689
All the while, the police been working the front desk told those entering the

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:35.810
station, including their fellow officers, to help themselves to the literature,

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:43.919
saying, take it, it's free. Recently, two brochures, eight tracks and the video

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:49.520
why study the Bible, were translated into G-G-U-S, a Turkic language spoken by

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:56.319
some 150,000 people in the south of Moldova. What's been the reaction of those

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.919
who've seen the why study the Bible video? One sister, a native G-G-U speaker,

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:06.319
said with tears in her eyes. I'm hearing the same thing I've heard for years

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:12.319
in Russian, but this is going straight to my heart. I feel even more Jehovah's

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.719
love for me. And a man in the territory exclaimed,

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:22.719
you don't understand, he's speaking G-G-U-S, my G-G-U-S, Moldovan G-G-U-S,

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:27.840
without an accent. And I understand everything he's saying.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.680
Twenty special pioneers have been assigned to spearhead the search for honest-hearted

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.919
ones in this territory and are already conducting some 40 Bible studies.

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:42.639
Moldova may be the poorest country in Europe, but our brothers are spiritually rich

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:48.080
and well cared for. They continue to seek first the kingdom and trust in Jehovah

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.879
to provide life's necessities. Since 2005, our total average number of pioneers has doubled.

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:59.120
The time spent in the ministry by each kingdom publisher has increased by more than 20%,

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.960
and the number of return visits has also almost doubled.

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:09.439
This zeal for true worship has resulted in a ratio of 1 to 173.

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:16.560
It's my privilege to bring you the love and greetings of your Moldovan brothers and sisters,

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:26.879
including the 26 members of the Moldova Bethel family.
