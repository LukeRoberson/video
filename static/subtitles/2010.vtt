00:00:02.319 --> 00:00:06.639
and introduction to the book of Amos.

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:10.240
Amos, the prophet who wrote the book bearing his name,

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.199
describes himself as having been a herdsman,

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:16.480
and one who took care of sycamorphics.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.120
Amos came from the Judean town of Tukoa,

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.079
located south of Jerusalem.

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:29.390
Jehovah sent Amos as a prophet primarily to the northern kingdom of Israel.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.750
Amos prophesied sometime within the period from

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.549
829 to 804 BCE during the reign of King Jerobo in the Second.

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:46.990
Amos recorded his prophecy by about 804 BCE after he returned to Judah.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.109
He was a contemporary of the prophet's Jonah,

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:58.259
Joel, and Osea. The book of Amos has nine chapters.

00:00:58.259 --> 00:01:04.739
Chapter 1 contains judgment messages against a number of surrounding nations.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.219
Chapter 2 records pronouncements against Moab, Judah,

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:12.980
and the northern Ten Tribe Kingdom of Israel.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.780
Chapters 3 to 6 contain a message of judgment against Israel

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.980
because of the nation's false religious practices

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.900
and stubborn refusal to accept discipline.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.260
Israel has adopted a greedy materialistic lifestyle.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.659
Luxury-loving wives pressure their husbands to defraud the poor and lowly.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.859
Chapters 7 and 8 present a series of impressive visions.

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:48.180
Amos sees an unstoppable locus swarm and then a destructive fire.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:55.060
Next, a plumb line illustrates how far Israel has deviated from Jehovah's requirements.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:03.629
Finally, a basket of summer fruit signifies that Israel's end is near.

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:08.750
Did you know? During a meeting of the first century governing body,

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.789
James, Jesus' half-brother, quoted from the book of Amos to show that Jehovah

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:19.710
would gather kingdom errors from both Jews and Gentiles.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.750
Chapter 9 includes Jehovah's promise to raise up the booth of David,

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.469
referring to the royal line leading to the Messianic Kingdom.

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:38.669
As you read the book of Amos, note how Jehovah uses humble people to do important work.

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:44.270
How those who put faith in material things and ignore God will not prosper.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.069
And how Jehovah foretells the establishment of the Messianic Kingdom.
