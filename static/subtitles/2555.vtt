00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.040
Well, there have been so many changes.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.679
It's hard to keep up.

00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:10.119
We hear that a lot, and it's true.

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:14.859
So the question is, how did these changes come about?

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:19.359
Does the governing body get together on a Wednesday morning and say, well, what will we change

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:20.359
this week?

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.399
Let's throw the brotherhood off a guard a little bit.

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:29.079
That would not be faithful or discreet.

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:35.119
The fact is that although changes may seem to be announced one after another, the decision

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:41.560
to put the changes into effect is often years in the making.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.759
Now one of the first big changes that the current governing body had to grapple with had to

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:49.960
do with this.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.159
Is it feasible to have a branch committee serving in the United States?

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.759
Now for years, I thought was that we really couldn't have a branch committee functioning

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:10.079
in the United States because the states was host to the governing body and the world headquarters.

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:16.640
So this was going to be a big decision, and it wasn't taken overnight.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.599
A lot of consultation with mature, experienced brothers was necessary.

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:25.159
But finally, the decision was made.

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.200
And we believe that decision has had Jehovah's Ridge blessing.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:36.000
We're proud of our hard working branch committee, and we're happy to have their support.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.400
We need their support.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.879
Now let's consider a couple of other examples.

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:48.840
Beginning of the first week of January 2009, the school service meeting and the congregation

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.840
book study were merged.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.760
Now that decision was almost 10 years in the making.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.599
As far back as 1999, it was being discussed.

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:06.079
Well then, why wasn't the decision made 10 years earlier?

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.120
Because the governing body wanted to be sure.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.639
Will the brothers have what they need?

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:16.639
Will they have all of the spiritual food they need if we merge the meetings?

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:19.960
Now then one Wednesday, I think it was about 3.30 in the afternoon.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.919
We'd had a long meeting.

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:29.280
We received two letters from a large branches, and one of the branches said that they had

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.680
many large congregations with seven or eight book studies, but with only one elder and

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.159
one ministerial servant.

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.960
So the elder might conduct five book studies, and the ministerial servant might conduct

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.960
three.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.280
And then they had all of the parts on the meetings to prepare.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.319
So all they were doing with their time was conducting book studies and preparing parts

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.599
for the meetings.

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.800
It was hard.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.719
And then the same week we received a letter from another branch, and they explained why

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:01.319
the attendance at the book study was so low.

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.479
They explained that the publishers loved the meetings, all of the meetings, including

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:12.360
the book study, but they're very poor, and they couldn't afford the bus fare to attend

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.479
two mid-week meetings.

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:16.400
They had to choose.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.719
And if they attended the school and service meeting, they could get almost two hours of

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:25.560
spiritual direction, whereas with the book study they would get one.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.280
So most of the time it was the school and service meeting that won out.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:38.439
Well, those two letters put a real face on the situation, and it helped us to make the

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:39.759
decision.

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:48.439
Now in 2008, a public edition and a study edition of The Watch Tower began to be published.

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:52.520
That decision was a long time coming.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.319
We discussed the possibility off and on, but we always said, let's not be hasty, let's

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.479
wait a little bit, let's see what Jehovah wants.

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:03.919
The main thing was, what would Jehovah want?

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.960
And how would we know?

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.800
We decided to make a sort of fleece test.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:17.120
And so in 2006, we began publishing one awake a month, but we kept publishing two watchtowers.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.240
So that would be three magazines per month instead of four.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.279
And the rationale was, we'll try it for a year.

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:29.839
And if at the end of a year our magazine placements have plummeted, we'll know that Jehovah is

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:34.839
not backing this arrangement, we can go back to producing two Awakes a year.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.600
Well, what was the result?

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.560
At the end of the year, we were placing as many magazines at three per month as we had

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.720
been placing at four per month the year before.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.000
So that indicated to us that Jehovah was backing the arrangement and how many of us have

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.319
appreciated having a study edition of The Watch Tower that speaks directly to the Brotherhood

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:01.000
and then a public edition of The Watch Tower.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.319
That can be tailored a little bit more to the needs of the public.

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:11.519
Now before making any decision that affects the kingdom work, the governing body has

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:15.720
to carefully consider the spiritual implications.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.279
An example.

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:24.360
In 2008, the decision was made to reduce the length of public talks from 45 minutes to

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.680
30 minutes.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.959
Well, you see, how could that decision possibly affect the spirituality of the Brotherhood?

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:38.040
And if you're serving in an urban congregation with many elders and nearby, there are other

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.800
urban congregations with many elders, perhaps you'd have difficulty in understanding the

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.800
reasoning.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.240
But the governing body has to look at the whole picture.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.600
Thousands of our brothers have served with Anita's great and they've learned a foreign

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.680
language.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.720
And in many, many of these congregations, the learners are the elders.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:04.959
Some of the learners have told us that for every minute of a public talk, it is required

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:07.360
one hour of preparation.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.199
So can you imagine 45 minute public talk, 45 hours for some of them?

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:17.959
So the reduction in the length of the public talks has actually meant that these congregations

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:21.240
could have more public talks.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.600
That's not all.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.720
There are thousands of elders who are serving in isolated congregations that may be a hundred

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.920
miles or more from the next congregation.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.240
So in one congregation, you have one elder and then a hundred miles away, you have another

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.519
congregation with one elder.

00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:42.319
How many public talks were those brothers getting when there were 45 minute public talks?

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:46.199
The 15 minute reduction made a difference.

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:51.199
So if we take a narrow view and think only about our own situation and our own congregation,

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:56.720
well, we can have difficulty in understanding why certain decisions are made.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.639
Now, the same principles apply to clarifications in our beliefs.

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:06.519
The governing body loves to get together and discuss the Bible, and when those Bibles

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:10.600
come out on the table and when the brothers bring their research in and they're starting

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.480
to search the scriptures and analyze the scriptures, you see the happy smiles on their faces.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:20.240
The brothers love discussing spiritual things.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:27.000
The clarifications are often a long time in coming into print.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Why?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.279
Because the clarification on one scripture can have a domino effect on others.

00:07:33.279 --> 00:07:38.079
The clarification on one scripture can have ramifications on other prophecies, so we

00:07:38.079 --> 00:07:42.879
have to be absolutely sure that everything fits.

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:49.279
So to reiterate, although certain changes may be announced one after another, these decisions

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:52.560
are thought out very carefully.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.079
And here's an interesting side point.

00:07:55.079 --> 00:08:01.160
The older members of the governing body, brother Jaros, brother Barr, were just as interested

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.519
in making the adjustments as the younger members were.

00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:07.399
They were very progressive.
