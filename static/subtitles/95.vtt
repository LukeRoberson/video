WEBVTT

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:06.740
It's a pleasure to welcome you to JW Broadcasting.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.220
What can we look forward to in this month's program?

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.859
In the series, Iron Sharpen's Iron,

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:15.060
we'll join an experienced circuit overseer

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.579
for some field-tested suggestions

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:20.300
on how we can use questions to start

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.019
and continue good conversations in the ministry.

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:26.100
Day after day, our young people are tested

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.179
to compromise their integrity.

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:30.260
We'll meet Cory and Camera,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.179
two young people who talk, frankly,

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:36.060
about the pressure they faced in high school to have sex.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.460
How did they resist temptation and stand their ground?

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.020
Do you find the idea of conducting a Bible study

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.460
intimidating in a new dramatization?

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.340
Jade conducts her first Bible study

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.420
and learns what it takes to be an effective teacher.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:16.230
This is the October 2022 edition of JW Broadcasting.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.030
For over 100 years,

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.829
Jehovah's Organization has been producing books

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.109
to help us teach people Bible truths.

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:27.950
Do you remember when some of these study books were released?

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.629
This means everlasting life was released in 1950.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.829
The truth that leads to eternal life in 1968.

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.069
You can live forever in Paradise on Earth in 1982

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:45.670
and knowledge that leads to everlasting life in 1995.

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.829
What did those titles have in common?

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:51.829
They show that it's possible for a person

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.870
to learn what Jehovah requires to live forever.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.790
And that's why we keep searching for people

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.150
who are rightly disposed for everlasting life

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.549
and who are willing to study the Bible with us.

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.390
All those books and several more that we publish since then

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.750
have been instrumental in helping people become believers

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.949
in our wonderful hope for the future.

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:18.550
In 2021, we added one more book to the list entitled

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.430
Enjoy Life Forever and Interactive Bible Course.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.389
This title adds another element that is possible

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:28.750
not only to gain everlasting life,

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.270
but also to learn how to enjoy life even now.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.990
The title is taken from Psalm 2226,

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.750
which says,

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:42.189
Those seeking Jehovah will praise him,

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:45.349
may you enjoy life forever.

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.030
This newest study publication is very different

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.909
from all the others that we've produced.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.150
In this broadcast, we want to explain

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.310
what went on behind the scenes to produce Enjoy Life Forever.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.229
Under the direction of the governing body,

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:02.430
hundreds of Bethelites around the world

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.229
worked very hard to make it possible

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:06.789
for us to have this innovative study tool.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.229
However, they'll be quick to say

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:11.830
that all credit for this goes to Jehovah.

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:14.150
That's why we can say,

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.629
just as the prophet Isaiah said in ancient times

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.830
of our great God,

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.590
O Jehovah,

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.030
everything we have done you have accomplished for us.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.949
We know that any success we enjoy

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:31.110
is because of Jehovah's direction and blessing.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.310
And so the theme of this presentation is,

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.469
see what Jehovah has done for us.

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:41.389
The faithful discrete slave has always taken

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:45.789
very seriously Jesus command recorded at Matthew 28.19.

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:49.270
Go and make disciples of people of all the nations,

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.069
baptizing them.

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.469
And that's what our Bible study activity aims to accomplish.

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:57.629
For decades, our method of conducting studies

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:02.430
was to study printed material paragraph by paragraph.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.310
When answering the questions for the paragraph,

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.469
some students would often just repeat

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:08.669
what was stated in the book.

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:10.509
However, it was hard to know whether the truth

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:11.949
was really touching their heart.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.389
With enjoy life forever,

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:16.750
we're using a different method of teaching

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.750
that generates candid expressions

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.310
by the students in their own words.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.310
This is just what the governing body feels is needed

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.990
to bring new ones to dedication and baptism

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.910
during these urgent last days.

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:31.910
If you've begun conducting Bible studies

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:33.189
with enjoy life forever,

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:36.550
you can appreciate how it's adjusting our Bible study work.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.269
Here's what some long time pioneers have said

00:04:40.269 --> 00:04:43.310
after covering just one lesson on their studies.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.709
This was the most beautiful spiritual conversation

00:04:47.709 --> 00:04:49.389
I've ever had with a student.

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:54.430
My student revealed things she had never told me before.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.949
I felt as if I was hearing her heart for the first time.

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:03.430
It truly reaches the heart and motivates students to action.

00:05:04.709 --> 00:05:06.230
And one brother wrote,

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.189
I am so excited about this new Bible course

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:11.750
that I am begging Jehovah to hear my prayers

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.990
to be able to conduct progressive studies.

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:19.110
It was early in 2019 when the writing committee

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.750
took on the amazing project

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.269
to produce a new Bible study tool.

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:26.069
They assembled a team of writers, designers,

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:29.069
and consultants to investigate whether we could improve

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:31.589
the publications that we were then using.

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:35.230
At the very first discussion session,

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.550
everyone was encouraged to pray often

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:38.910
about the task at hand,

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.670
to pray when thinking about it,

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.589
when brainstorming with others and when working on it,

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:47.189
and to respond to the influence of Holy Spirit.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:49.829
Why pray so much?

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:55.189
Proverbs 16 verse three gives the answer.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.589
Commit to Jehovah whatever you do

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:00.790
and your plans will succeed.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.310
The team was also encouraged to think outside the box,

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.310
which means to think outside or beyond

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.509
the way things have always been done in the past.

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:13.550
Times have changed, people have changed,

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.589
and the way that many prefer to be taught has changed.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.269
These days, they respond better to multimedia

00:06:20.269 --> 00:06:22.550
that engages them and holds their attention.

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:25.910
The team has shown a puzzle

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:29.470
that illustrates what it means to think outside the box,

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.550
the nine dots puzzle.

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.310
The challenge is to connect all nine dots

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.709
with just four straight lines.

00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:40.350
Here are a few examples of how some will try to solve the puzzle.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.870
Notice that with each attempt, one dot is missed.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.709
The problem is that our mind tends to build a box

00:06:46.709 --> 00:06:49.110
around the dots, and that instantly limits

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.230
what we can imagine.

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:53.949
The only way to connect all nine dots

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:58.189
with just four straight lines is by going outside the box

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:03.500
and thinking differently than we normally would.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.420
The point was to show that novel, creative thinking

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.500
was needed to imagine something

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.660
other than the traditional way of studying the Bible with people.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.939
With Jehovah's Spirit guiding, fresh thinking,

00:07:14.939 --> 00:07:17.620
it would be interesting to see what innovative ideas

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.019
could be thought of on how to teach the truth to Bible students.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.980
And yet it was felt that our brothers and sisters

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.300
would need to see some familiar features in the new publication.

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:30.740
That's why the first part of each lesson is designed

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.980
similar to the Good News brochure.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.139
It features numbered questions, each followed by a paragraph

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:39.939
that briefly covers fundamental facts about the topic.

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:44.379
Next, the dig deeper section, Reasons on the Topic,

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:46.459
shows how to apply what's learned

00:07:46.459 --> 00:07:50.379
and discusses what the topic teaches us about Jehovah.

00:07:50.379 --> 00:07:54.259
It includes features found in the Life and Ministry meeting workbook,

00:07:54.259 --> 00:07:58.500
bolleted discussion points, scriptures to read, videos to play,

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.500
and viewpoint questions to answer.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.939
And like the study articles in the Watch Tower,

00:08:03.939 --> 00:08:08.660
the last part of each lesson includes just three review questions.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.100
It was decided that we could cover much less printed material

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.100
and let the Bible do the teaching.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.259
That we need to draw out the student's feelings

00:08:17.259 --> 00:08:19.899
with well-worded viewpoint questions

00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:22.100
and include videos in generous artwork.

00:08:23.579 --> 00:08:27.500
We must help the student to see Jehovah as a real person

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.540
and to develop a warm relationship with him

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.100
and encourage the student to get into a routine

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.220
or regular Bible reading prayer and meeting attendance.

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:39.940
Does enjoy life forever provide what we need

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:41.980
to accomplish all of that?

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.100
It certainly does.

00:08:44.139 --> 00:08:47.779
The scriptures are the focal point of each lesson.

00:08:47.779 --> 00:08:50.860
So the student is prompted to find answers in the Bible.

00:08:51.779 --> 00:08:53.940
The questions draw out the student's feelings

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.019
about what he's learning.

00:08:56.019 --> 00:08:58.820
Early in the course, students are helped to appreciate

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:03.419
what Jehovah is like, to feel his love for them

00:09:03.419 --> 00:09:07.100
and to see how to draw close to him as their friend.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.620
The beautiful artwork and motivating videos

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.659
have real emotional impact.

00:09:12.659 --> 00:09:16.019
This project to produce enjoy life forever

00:09:16.019 --> 00:09:18.700
require the collaboration of six departments

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.700
at World Headquarters.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.700
As directed by the governing body,

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.019
the writing department researched,

00:09:25.019 --> 00:09:28.659
wrote, and proofread the text for each lesson.

00:09:28.659 --> 00:09:30.500
These were then sent to hundreds of brothers

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.820
and sisters around the world to test them

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.220
on their Bible studies.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.419
The writing department coordinated the work

00:09:37.419 --> 00:09:40.659
with other departments to keep the project on schedule.

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:45.340
Translation services helped to simplify the vocabulary

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.779
and logic of what was written.

00:09:47.779 --> 00:09:51.059
They identified any English text that would be a problem

00:09:51.059 --> 00:09:53.820
for translators to render in their local languages.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.899
As of right now, enjoy life forever has been approved

00:09:57.899 --> 00:10:00.580
and upward of 700 languages.

00:10:01.539 --> 00:10:04.700
The art department designed the book's layout and artwork.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:08.100
Teams and several branches photograph models

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.500
to help the illustrators create the many beautiful scenes

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:16.139
that appear in the book, which contains over 600 images.

00:10:16.139 --> 00:10:18.139
Maps programming developed new tools

00:10:18.139 --> 00:10:20.100
so that the digital version of the book

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:25.100
in the JW Library app would look similar to the printed edition.

00:10:25.299 --> 00:10:27.019
This was the first publication

00:10:27.019 --> 00:10:29.500
for which both print and digital formats

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.299
were designed simultaneously.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.740
Text processing services composed the text and artwork

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.139
for both the print and digital formats,

00:10:38.139 --> 00:10:40.659
transcribed the book into English Braille

00:10:40.659 --> 00:10:43.259
and instructed the branches on how to produce the book

00:10:43.259 --> 00:10:45.139
in their languages.

00:10:45.139 --> 00:10:47.980
Audio video services produced several new videos

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.779
and excerpts of many existing videos

00:10:50.779 --> 00:10:53.340
from the JW.org website.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.139
They also produced unique audio recordings

00:10:56.139 --> 00:10:59.299
of the book that include various voices and sounds.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.460
This was truly a collaborative effort,

00:11:03.259 --> 00:11:07.220
but there was a major problem that could have stalled this project,

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:08.539
COVID-19.

00:11:09.539 --> 00:11:13.059
When World Headquarters and the branches were locked down,

00:11:13.059 --> 00:11:16.899
60% of the project still needed to be completed,

00:11:16.899 --> 00:11:19.899
and yet the governing body had given it high priority.

00:11:21.179 --> 00:11:23.419
The following video will give you some idea

00:11:23.419 --> 00:11:25.980
of how the departments worked together

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:29.379
to get their work done despite the challenges they faced

00:11:29.379 --> 00:11:30.740
during the pandemic.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.779
Everything about enjoy life forever is different

00:11:33.779 --> 00:11:36.580
from any other publication we've produced in the past

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.139
and from the start of the project, two things were critical,

00:11:39.139 --> 00:11:42.059
good communication and good documentation.

00:11:42.059 --> 00:11:44.139
But honestly, time and again, the thing that proved

00:11:44.139 --> 00:11:46.740
to be the most important was reliance on Jehovah.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.500
The writing committee's goal was to create a first-class

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:53.620
digital experience that would engage Bible students.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:57.019
The digital design system had to be completely remodeled

00:11:57.019 --> 00:11:59.299
so that enjoy life forever would look uniform,

00:11:59.299 --> 00:12:04.100
whether it's viewed in JW Library on JW.org or in print.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.419
Right from the inception of this project,

00:12:06.419 --> 00:12:08.740
the brothers looked for inputs of a study material

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.500
would be easily available in as many languages as possible.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.700
And for that reason, a team from translation services

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.139
worked along with the writers.

00:12:18.019 --> 00:12:20.299
A publication of this size would usually take

00:12:20.299 --> 00:12:22.620
about two or three years to complete,

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.500
but the writing committee was really interested

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.299
in getting the enjoy life forever book

00:12:26.299 --> 00:12:28.179
out there as soon as possible.

00:12:28.179 --> 00:12:30.299
The enjoy life forever book required an intense

00:12:30.299 --> 00:12:31.580
amount of collaboration.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.419
Right from the beginning, the writing committee

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:35.220
got all six departments together

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.539
so we could work in idly through their production.

00:12:38.539 --> 00:12:41.580
Enjoy life forever has many elements.

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:45.580
Over 250 pages of text, 597 images,

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:53.340
121 video boxes, 840 links, and 62 QR codes.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:01.700
Also, the goal box must allow the student to add text

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.220
and we had to build alternate layouts for languages

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:08.139
that have longer text and for languages

00:13:08.139 --> 00:13:10.019
that read right to the end.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.940
Our existing toolset didn't have the ability

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.500
to style digital publications like we can with print.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.379
We could do black text on a white background with gray boxes.

00:13:21.379 --> 00:13:23.220
That was the extent of the functionality

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.379
that we had available.

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:28.460
And joy life forever is very interactive for the student.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.860
When producing the audio for this publication,

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.340
we endeavor to maintain that feel.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.860
So we added multiple voices, musical cues,

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.700
and in some cases, the audio track for the video

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.580
was re-edited to teach the point effectively.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.460
When we got to Lesson 32,

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.580
we felt that it might be too complicated

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.940
to build as a digital experience,

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:51.580
but that's when the collaboration really paid off.

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.980
It took every tool that we had,

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.940
and basically every trick in order

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.580
to build the digital version of that lesson.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:00.259
As we were working on the prototype,

00:14:00.259 --> 00:14:02.659
we would collaborate with the user experience group

00:14:02.659 --> 00:14:05.299
to make sure that the look and feel of the digital addition

00:14:05.299 --> 00:14:06.139
was the same,

00:14:06.139 --> 00:14:09.419
whether it was on a large device or a small device.

00:14:09.419 --> 00:14:11.700
The entire chart is a visual aid.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.700
So we wanted to be sure that all of our users,

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.820
especially those who are visually impaired,

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.580
would be able to understand the teaching point.

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.580
This required us to build the chart

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:23.100
so that screen readers could read the text

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.340
and that each picture would have a description

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:26.379
for those who needed it.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:28.899
Early in the concept stage,

00:14:28.899 --> 00:14:31.139
we understood that there would be about 200 videos

00:14:31.139 --> 00:14:34.580
in this publication requiring thousands of hours of work.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.460
Eight brand new videos of the remaining videos

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.139
around 60 would need to be edited.

00:14:40.139 --> 00:14:41.820
Just as the eight new videos were entering

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.860
the production phase, COVID-19 hit,

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.139
effectively halting video production around the world.

00:14:48.139 --> 00:14:50.779
This work stoppage continued until each branch

00:14:50.779 --> 00:14:53.259
could determine how they could film safely

00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:56.779
and still meet the deadline only nine months away.

00:14:56.779 --> 00:14:57.980
Due to the pandemic,

00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.460
photo sessions here at headquarters

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.860
were completely stopped for four months.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.179
Now, as things progressed,

00:15:03.179 --> 00:15:05.379
we were able to resume photography

00:15:05.379 --> 00:15:08.259
only adhering to strict protocols.

00:15:08.259 --> 00:15:10.940
For example, we had a family photograph themselves

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.820
while being directed by the art department here.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.580
So everything that a Bible study conductor

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:16.899
has been trained to do,

00:15:16.899 --> 00:15:18.340
ask all the important questions,

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.779
develop love for Jehovah in their Bible students,

00:15:20.779 --> 00:15:23.980
show videos, it's all built into the publication.

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:27.179
So would the concept work with actual Bible students?

00:15:27.179 --> 00:15:29.500
To find out we did in-house testing,

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:30.500
and then at the same time,

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.580
we sent out the lessons around the world

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:36.259
to publishers, pioneers, missionaries, circuit overseers,

00:15:36.259 --> 00:15:39.299
and they used the lessons with actual Bible students.

00:15:39.299 --> 00:15:41.940
And we tested every lesson of the book this way.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:43.980
And then the responses that we got back were analyzed

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.299
and we made further refinements.

00:15:46.299 --> 00:15:48.299
We had hundreds of team meetings

00:15:48.299 --> 00:15:50.700
and we felt Jehovah's Holy Spirit equipping all of us

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.860
after we opened a meeting with prayer.

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:55.820
When you collaborate, you get a better product.

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:59.779
It's more direct, simpler, and easier to understand.

00:15:59.779 --> 00:16:02.539
Also, thinking ahead about potential transition problems

00:16:02.539 --> 00:16:03.820
and addressing them,

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:06.659
helped expedite translation in hundreds of languages.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:12.059
I saw firsthand how Jehovah uses his organization

00:16:12.059 --> 00:16:15.220
to give us what we need at the right time,

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.940
even with the pandemic.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:20.620
The results showed me that Jehovah was in control

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.259
of the project.

00:16:22.259 --> 00:16:24.899
I feel that Jehovah helped us accomplish this job

00:16:24.899 --> 00:16:26.419
in a shorter amount of time

00:16:26.419 --> 00:16:28.460
and a quality that would have been very difficult

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.620
even under normal circumstances.

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:34.230
How amazing is Jehovah?

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:35.389
With the governing body,

00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:38.110
wholeheartedly embracing the project

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:39.789
and everyone on the production team

00:16:39.789 --> 00:16:41.789
willingly giving their all,

00:16:41.789 --> 00:16:44.710
we could see clear evidence of Jehovah's backing.

00:16:46.029 --> 00:16:49.509
Now that we've seen what Jehovah has wonderfully done for us,

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:51.309
what must we do for him?

00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:56.029
Remember Jesus commanded Matthew 28, 19 and 20

00:16:56.029 --> 00:16:58.549
applies to all Christians.

00:16:58.549 --> 00:16:59.750
Regarding that command,

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:02.509
note what the article keep busy during the last

00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:06.109
of the last day's states in the October 2019 issue

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:07.150
of the watchtower.

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:10.750
As we conduct Bible studies,

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:13.910
we have to try our best to make disciples,

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:17.269
teaching them to observe all the things Jesus has commanded.

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:21.390
We need to help people understand how important it is

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:25.269
for them to take their stand for Jehovah and his kingdom.

00:17:25.269 --> 00:17:27.150
This means trying to motivate people

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:31.069
to make the truth their own by applying what they learn,

00:17:31.069 --> 00:17:35.150
dedicating their life to Jehovah and getting baptized.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.269
Only then will they survive Jehovah's Day.

00:17:39.349 --> 00:17:40.750
In most parts of the earth,

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:43.990
people are not waiting in line for Bible studies.

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:46.630
So we have to be proactive trying our best

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:48.630
to find people with whom we can start

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:50.789
and conduct progressive studies,

00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:53.509
using our interactive Bible course.

00:17:53.509 --> 00:17:56.549
We want as many right-handed persons as possible

00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:59.549
to become Jehovah's willing loyal witnesses.

00:18:00.509 --> 00:18:03.150
Here are seven suggestions you can write down now

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:04.509
and try later.

00:18:04.509 --> 00:18:05.509
They really work.

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:11.430
The first and most important is pray for a Bible study.

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:14.789
Never underestimate the power of prayer.

00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:19.789
So be specific in your prayers and keep praying for studies.

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:21.430
Work in harmony with your prayers

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:24.390
by offering studies at every opportunity,

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:27.029
including to your relatives and acquaintances.

00:18:28.069 --> 00:18:31.829
Two, show people the brochure.

00:18:31.829 --> 00:18:34.950
Use the intriguing question on the back cover

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:36.910
to peak their interest.

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:40.549
It asks, is it possible to enjoy life forever?

00:18:41.589 --> 00:18:43.789
Offer to cover the three introductory lessons

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:45.309
in the brochure.

00:18:45.309 --> 00:18:48.069
After that, the person can decide whether to continue

00:18:48.069 --> 00:18:50.470
with the rest of the Bible course in the book.

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:55.269
Three, try the direct approach.

00:18:55.269 --> 00:18:57.269
Introduce yourself as a Bible teacher

00:18:57.269 --> 00:18:59.230
and come right out and ask people

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:01.589
whether they would like to learn more about the Bible.

00:19:02.589 --> 00:19:04.430
Explain that we have a most enjoyable

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:06.869
and easy interactive Bible course

00:19:06.869 --> 00:19:09.470
and that you have openings in your teaching schedule.

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:15.309
Four, ask your studies for referrals.

00:19:15.309 --> 00:19:17.670
You can do this while studying the first paragraph

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:20.190
of lesson one, it asks.

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:22.710
Do you think that the Bible can help anyone you know?

00:19:23.789 --> 00:19:26.549
If your student mentions a friend, a relative,

00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:28.710
a neighbor, or a workmate,

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:31.349
offer to demonstrate the course to that person.

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:36.430
Five, approach meeting attenders.

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:38.390
Don't assume that interested ones

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:41.829
you see at congregation meetings are already studying.

00:19:41.829 --> 00:19:43.069
Ask them.

00:19:43.069 --> 00:19:45.269
And if they are not currently studying,

00:19:45.269 --> 00:19:46.710
offer to get them started.

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:52.549
Six, ask non-witness marriage mates.

00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:55.430
When was the last time they were offered a Bible study?

00:19:56.349 --> 00:19:58.869
Even if they had declined an offer in the past,

00:19:58.869 --> 00:20:00.910
they might be interested now

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:04.390
and they may prefer to study with someone outside their family.

00:20:05.549 --> 00:20:09.150
And seven, talk to those who studied before.

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:11.829
Did you study with someone years ago

00:20:11.829 --> 00:20:13.710
in one of our other publications

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:16.150
who did not make any progress?

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:17.829
Why not contact them?

00:20:17.829 --> 00:20:21.230
Explain that we have a new interactive Bible course

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:23.910
and ask if they'd like to study again.

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:26.230
This may be just what they need now

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:30.259
to act on what they learn.

00:20:30.259 --> 00:20:32.460
A key principle that applies to the efforts

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:35.019
we put forth in the Bible study work

00:20:35.019 --> 00:20:39.500
is found at Galatians six verse nine, which says,

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.779
so let us not give up in doing what is fine

00:20:42.779 --> 00:20:47.220
for a new time we will reap if we do not tire out.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:50.019
So may we never lose our enthusiasm

00:20:50.019 --> 00:20:53.500
and making disciples nor relax our efforts.

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:57.099
With Jehovah's rich blessing on our Bible study activity,

00:20:57.099 --> 00:20:59.500
use the enjoy life forever.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.579
We'll be able to say thankfully,

00:21:01.579 --> 00:21:04.420
oh Jehovah, everything we have done,

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:10.119
you have accomplished for us.

00:21:10.119 --> 00:21:13.079
One way we've been trained to become better disciples makers

00:21:13.079 --> 00:21:14.359
is through the videos.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:18.559
Do you remember when we first met Nida and Jabe

00:21:18.559 --> 00:21:21.559
during the 2020 Always Rejoice Convention?

00:21:22.519 --> 00:21:25.279
That series provided so many valuable lessons

00:21:25.279 --> 00:21:27.559
about what it takes to be an effective teacher.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.759
This month we have another new dramatization.

00:21:31.759 --> 00:21:35.480
And in this episode, the story has come full circle

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:39.200
with Jade now conducting her first Bible study

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.039
using enjoy life forever.

00:22:11.299 --> 00:22:17.319
Who, what's your biggest question about life?

00:22:17.319 --> 00:22:22.819
Why are people so obsessed with clicking round objects?

00:22:22.819 --> 00:22:27.819
Well, there's that, but seriously, anything?

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:33.690
Why do people hate?

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:36.329
If we all go to children, what's the deal?

00:22:36.329 --> 00:22:37.730
Good question.

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:40.049
And one of the Bible definitely answers.

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:45.769
But you've a train to catch, so we'll stop there.

00:22:45.769 --> 00:22:50.680
But is Tuesday still good?

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:54.440
Suming space time hasn't collapsed into a singularity.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:57.259
I'm open.

00:22:57.259 --> 00:22:58.579
OK.

00:22:58.579 --> 00:22:59.579
Cool.

00:23:00.579 --> 00:23:23.650
So, on Tuesday, we'll carry on with...

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:27.589
So, how's the study going?

00:23:29.109 --> 00:23:31.549
Brilliant. Was it the right for the easy stuff?

00:23:31.549 --> 00:23:37.819
So, what I loved about this prophecy

00:23:37.819 --> 00:23:40.299
is that it was written like 200 years

00:23:40.299 --> 00:23:43.859
before actually happened and every single detail came true.

00:23:43.859 --> 00:23:49.980
The men in charge just left the gates open.

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.579
I mean, I would have fired anyone that got drunk

00:23:52.579 --> 00:23:58.160
and left to see gates open.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.720
Anyway, back to the prophecy.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:03.559
So, God is love, but he's going to kill billions.

00:24:03.559 --> 00:24:05.160
How's that work?

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.799
Well, it'll make sense later.

00:24:06.799 --> 00:24:10.400
But for now, let's just focus on what I was talking about earlier.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.359
What's so nice about this chapter is that it's talking about prayer.

00:24:13.359 --> 00:24:16.839
Well, it's talking about how Jehovah helps us with prayer.

00:24:16.839 --> 00:24:19.640
And so, it's really lovely, because we can pray to someone

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:26.980
that's basically all of this is evidence of the last days.

00:24:27.019 --> 00:24:30.420
So, what would you say of the signs of the last days?

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:34.660
Wars.

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:37.299
Disasters.

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:40.140
Red people.

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:42.940
Yep.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:44.900
Anything else?

00:24:46.619 --> 00:24:47.619
No.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:49.700
Okay.

00:24:50.819 --> 00:24:54.700
That's fine. We can just, we'll just review it in the next lesson.

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:55.700
That's fine.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.420
Do you want to just wrap it up now then?

00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:03.230
Yeah.

00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:06.420
Is everything okay?

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:09.369
This will.

00:25:09.369 --> 00:25:11.369
I'm going to go.

00:25:11.369 --> 00:25:23.259
All right, bye, Gladys.

00:25:23.259 --> 00:25:24.539
She just said one word.

00:25:24.539 --> 00:25:26.259
I just...

00:25:26.259 --> 00:25:30.099
I said I want to do.

00:25:30.099 --> 00:25:32.619
Wow, thankfully I've never had a student like that.

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.539
Okay, she's really getting a hang of the ceremony.

00:25:35.539 --> 00:25:39.259
Is she?

00:25:39.259 --> 00:25:41.819
But seriously, I...

00:25:41.819 --> 00:25:46.059
I really put myself into the study to try and make it live.

00:25:46.059 --> 00:25:47.339
And I get...

00:25:47.339 --> 00:25:48.579
Yes.

00:25:48.579 --> 00:25:49.859
No.

00:25:49.859 --> 00:25:51.220
Maybe.

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:56.650
Or another insufferable off-topic question.

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:58.650
Maybe let's do a bit of research.

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:02.920
And you'd say that.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.279
I'll put the kit along.

00:26:04.279 --> 00:26:05.279
Thanks.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.200
Here we go.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.519
October 2020, watch tower.

00:26:10.519 --> 00:26:16.460
This box.

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:20.339
Exercise self-control by not talking too much.

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.539
I guess I do need help.

00:26:27.539 --> 00:26:30.700
But look, let the students see that you're excited

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:31.980
about Bible truths.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:35.150
But on there?

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:40.099
Make friends in the congregation.

00:26:40.099 --> 00:26:44.099
I could or maybe we could do this.

00:26:44.099 --> 00:26:47.900
Look for signs that reveal her desire to serve Jehovah.

00:26:49.779 --> 00:26:52.099
Who's free on Friday?

00:26:52.099 --> 00:26:53.539
Sorry, Jalen, busy.

00:26:53.539 --> 00:27:23.200
Oh, yeah, I'd love to.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.079
So, a surprise today.

00:27:25.079 --> 00:27:28.480
My usual lecture has been cancelled in favour of a discussion.

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.619
And?

00:27:31.619 --> 00:27:34.059
Jalen, I'm not really the drum roll type.

00:27:34.059 --> 00:27:35.059
Oh, OK.

00:27:35.059 --> 00:27:35.900
Hi.

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.539
I'm Nita, one of Jalen's remakes.

00:27:38.539 --> 00:27:39.980
And you're...

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:42.660
Gladys.

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:47.019
So, let's start with the question you hit me with last time.

00:27:47.019 --> 00:27:51.299
Which is, why do we stay neutral when we see injustice?

00:27:51.299 --> 00:27:55.640
I take it. You've had your fair share?

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.799
Hmm. Me too.

00:27:57.799 --> 00:28:00.039
Although, not as bad as my mum and dad

00:28:00.039 --> 00:28:01.839
for not telling me.

00:28:01.839 --> 00:28:03.640
But how are things ever changed

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.240
if we don't do something about it?

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.319
Let's see what the Bible has to say.

00:28:08.319 --> 00:28:11.920
In Jeremiah chapter 10,

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:16.000
on verse 23, could you read that?

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.599
I will know, O Jehovah, that man's way does not belong to him.

00:28:20.599 --> 00:28:26.440
It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his death.

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.319
But, if that's true,

00:28:28.319 --> 00:28:32.440
then the future of the human race is looking quite bleak.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:44.650
Does that mean anything bad?

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:47.529
Jade was excited to conduct a study.

00:28:47.529 --> 00:28:49.170
But she learned that making disciples

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:51.730
takes more than just enthusiasm.

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:53.569
It also requires patience

00:28:53.569 --> 00:28:58.130
and the self-control to talk less and listen more.

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:00.410
Nita helped Jade improve her teaching

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:02.130
by doing a little research

00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:05.130
in the October 2020 issue of the Watch Tower,

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:07.130
which featured two study articles

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:09.569
on conducting Bible studies.

00:29:09.569 --> 00:29:11.930
Earlier that same year, the January issue

00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:14.450
featured another study article entitled,

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:17.410
Go Therefore and Make Disciples.

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:19.970
That article was filled with suggestions

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:23.730
on how to help our students draw closer to Jehovah.

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:26.009
Listen to the impact those suggestions

00:29:26.009 --> 00:29:28.490
have had on three regular pioneers

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:30.490
in our next video from the series,

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:48.099
Lessons from the Watch Tower.

00:29:48.099 --> 00:29:50.660
Now, goal as teachers is to help the person

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:55.599
to become a disciple of Christ.

00:29:55.599 --> 00:29:59.319
I want my student to love Jehovah the same way that I do.

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:02.680
What I most enjoy is conducting Bible studies.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:05.599
Being able to see a student grow spiritually

00:30:05.599 --> 00:30:08.640
is a joy that can't be put into words.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.160
The Watch Tower of January 2020

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:14.200
mentions several things that we need to keep in mind

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.880
as we conduct a study.

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.920
Studying the article, I saw how many changes

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.559
I needed to make when I conduct a Bible study.

00:30:22.559 --> 00:30:24.880
It highlighted that besides helping the student

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:27.160
to gain knowledge, it's even more important

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.680
that we help them progress to the point

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.359
of dedicating their lives to Jehovah

00:30:31.359 --> 00:30:33.480
and of course getting baptized.

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.559
Even though I read about how we should stop

00:30:35.559 --> 00:30:38.319
studying with non-progressive Bible studies,

00:30:38.319 --> 00:30:40.279
I didn't feel comfortable doing it

00:30:40.279 --> 00:30:43.440
because I was afraid I might make the wrong decision.

00:30:44.559 --> 00:30:47.200
Although I was pretty sure that my Bible student

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.240
wasn't yet married, that is legally married,

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.319
she had never told me this directly.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:58.200
And I just didn't feel comfortable talking with her about it.

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.640
I had a Bible student who always prepared

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.799
for and commented well at the study.

00:31:02.799 --> 00:31:04.759
I kept inviting her to the meeting,

00:31:04.759 --> 00:31:07.680
but she never went to a single one.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.480
And she never attended the memorial.

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.160
I saw that she still had ties

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:17.740
with some aspects of her religion.

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.500
The article brought out that in the first few weeks,

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.420
as soon as the study becomes regular,

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:24.940
it's important to start praying with the student.

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:27.539
It used to take me a long time to start doing that.

00:31:28.539 --> 00:31:31.940
The article helped me because it encouraged me

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:34.140
to bring others with me on the study,

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:38.099
and also not to be afraid to bring along those

00:31:38.099 --> 00:31:39.859
who were more experienced.

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:43.779
In the article, it was brought out how important it is,

00:31:43.779 --> 00:31:46.380
not just for us to pray with our students,

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:48.740
but also to help them to begin saying

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.539
their own prayers as well.

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:54.619
After that, when the study became regular,

00:31:54.619 --> 00:31:57.220
I prayed before and after each session.

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:01.019
And I encouraged each of them to also begin praying

00:32:01.019 --> 00:32:02.819
to Jehovah personally.

00:32:02.819 --> 00:32:05.380
So praying became a daily habit for them.

00:32:06.579 --> 00:32:10.099
A circuit over a Sears wife went with me on the study,

00:32:10.099 --> 00:32:12.779
and she asked my student if she was married.

00:32:12.779 --> 00:32:14.740
Yes, I'm married.

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:16.460
What are you legally married?

00:32:17.339 --> 00:32:19.859
And then she responded, no.

00:32:21.019 --> 00:32:23.700
So that really opened up an opportunity for me

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:26.619
to help the student out with the situation.

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:29.900
The article gave some suggestions

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:31.779
about how we need to pay attention

00:32:31.779 --> 00:32:33.980
to the student's spiritual progress.

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:35.779
It really should be consistent.

00:32:37.059 --> 00:32:40.779
We studied for a long time, a little over a year,

00:32:40.779 --> 00:32:43.019
and that's when I realized that it was time for me

00:32:43.019 --> 00:32:46.819
to stop and decide if I should discontinue the study.

00:32:46.819 --> 00:32:48.859
Then I put into practice the suggestion

00:32:48.859 --> 00:32:51.700
from the Watchtower of January 2020.

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:53.740
I told her, you're really a someone

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:55.500
who appreciates God's word,

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:58.420
and you're always regular with your studies.

00:32:58.420 --> 00:32:59.900
But like we just read about,

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:02.660
there's some footage in your life that's missing.

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:06.900
But she responded, but I think it's all in Jehovah's time.

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:10.339
So I said, Jehovah has already invited you personally,

00:33:10.339 --> 00:33:12.019
so it's really up to you now.

00:33:12.019 --> 00:33:15.019
But she kept saying, well to me,

00:33:15.019 --> 00:33:17.019
it'll happen in Jehovah's time.

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:21.819
Unfortunately, it seemed better to discontinue the study

00:33:21.819 --> 00:33:23.740
because she showed that she didn't feel

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.380
the need to make progress.

00:33:26.779 --> 00:33:28.940
This article was a present from Jehovah.

00:33:30.299 --> 00:33:33.500
It was like everything that was important came altogether

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:35.579
in just one article.

00:33:35.579 --> 00:33:37.339
We're living in urgent times,

00:33:37.339 --> 00:33:40.180
so we need to be as efficient as possible.

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:42.140
The spiritual progress a person makes,

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:44.980
which may have taken five years, can take place now.

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:00.279
If you're currently conducting a Bible study,

00:34:00.279 --> 00:34:03.559
did you see any points you could put into practice?

00:34:03.559 --> 00:34:06.039
Are you starting each study with prayer

00:34:06.039 --> 00:34:08.960
and teaching your student how to pray?

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.519
Are you regularly inviting others

00:34:10.519 --> 00:34:12.440
to join you on the study?

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.800
And are you skillfully using questions

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.239
to find out what's really on your student's mind?

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:19.519
The art of using questions

00:34:19.519 --> 00:34:22.159
is a topic of our next video in the series,

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:23.840
Iron, Sharpen's Iron.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:25.840
Hola.

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.360
Hi, I'm Armando.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:29.480
Welcome to Iron, Sharpen's Iron.

00:34:39.489 --> 00:34:40.929
We've all been there.

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:42.690
We're out in the ministry,

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:44.969
trying to start conversations with people.

00:34:46.449 --> 00:34:50.449
But for many of us, it's not that easy.

00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:53.929
Just the idea of talking to a stranger

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:56.170
can be intimidating.

00:34:57.329 --> 00:35:00.369
Personally, I'm not someone who finds it easy

00:35:00.369 --> 00:35:05.579
to just walk up to a stranger and start a conversation.

00:35:05.579 --> 00:35:08.619
But with some effort and time,

00:35:08.619 --> 00:35:10.059
I've learned a few methods

00:35:10.059 --> 00:35:12.219
that have helped me to overcome my fears.

00:35:13.179 --> 00:35:16.820
Today, we're going to concentrate on just one of them,

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:21.500
using questions to start and maintain a conversation.

00:35:22.579 --> 00:35:24.579
And perhaps, by the time we're done,

00:35:24.579 --> 00:35:26.420
you'll realize like I have

00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:31.539
that it's not as difficult as it seems.

00:35:31.539 --> 00:35:33.099
Hi there.

00:35:33.099 --> 00:35:36.059
Well, we're asking our neighbors a question

00:35:36.059 --> 00:35:39.019
and we'd like to know your opinion.

00:35:39.019 --> 00:35:40.739
Have you ever asked yourself

00:35:40.739 --> 00:35:44.059
what we need to do to have a happy family?

00:35:44.059 --> 00:35:46.219
No, I'm not married.

00:35:46.219 --> 00:35:48.739
Oh, okay.

00:35:48.739 --> 00:35:53.260
Well, we have this brochure that talks about.

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.059
Okay, three things.

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:57.940
First, the brother was nervous.

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.380
When we're nervous,

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:03.219
we make the person we're speaking with nervous too.

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:06.900
Of course, it's difficult not to be nervous,

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:09.900
but if we concentrate too much

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:11.380
on how we feel,

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:13.539
we can forget that what we want to do

00:36:13.539 --> 00:36:15.340
is simply start a conversation.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:17.539
There's no pressure.

00:36:17.539 --> 00:36:20.900
Just keep it casual.

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:25.739
Second, yes, the brother did ask a question,

00:36:25.739 --> 00:36:28.820
but the question was irrelevant to the householder.

00:36:30.219 --> 00:36:32.300
It's usually better to ask something

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:33.659
that will encourage the person

00:36:33.659 --> 00:36:36.019
to participate in the conversation,

00:36:36.019 --> 00:36:39.380
but will also help us to discern what interests them.

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:44.380
Third, one of the biggest fears we have is

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:48.099
what if my question doesn't connect with them?

00:36:48.099 --> 00:36:49.900
This can throw us off.

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:52.739
We feel like we have nowhere to go.

00:36:52.739 --> 00:36:55.980
It would have been better to have a flexible approach

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:59.579
that would allow us to react according to what the person says.

00:37:00.579 --> 00:37:04.019
Let's try it again, but this time,

00:37:04.019 --> 00:37:07.139
let's approach the situation a little differently.

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:10.139
In the first few pages of our Bible,

00:37:10.139 --> 00:37:13.219
there are 20 questions that we can use in the ministry.

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:16.940
Why not start familiarizing ourselves with them?

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:20.340
We can choose one or two subjects that we like

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:23.940
so that we will be ready when an opportunity arises.

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:25.579
Let's see how our brother does this

00:37:25.579 --> 00:37:27.099
in the next demonstration.

00:37:28.619 --> 00:37:31.739
Hi there, we're asking our neighbors a question

00:37:31.739 --> 00:37:33.780
and we'd love to know your opinion.

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:36.420
What would you say is something that causes you

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:38.260
a lot of stress?

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:41.179
Personally, I worry a lot about money

00:37:41.179 --> 00:37:43.019
and paying all my bills.

00:37:43.019 --> 00:37:46.179
Yeah, I think that's the case for many of us.

00:37:46.179 --> 00:37:48.980
Did you know that the Bible explains something

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:52.139
that can help us specifically with that anxiety?

00:37:52.139 --> 00:37:53.380
Really?

00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:56.420
In the front of my Bible, there are 20 questions

00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:59.780
that many of us ask and that the Bible answers.

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:04.780
Notice question 16, how can you cope with anxiety?

00:38:06.659 --> 00:38:10.780
Notice what this scripture says in Proverbs 21-5,

00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:12.460
the plans of the diligent.

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.739
Much better, right?

00:38:15.739 --> 00:38:18.340
Did you notice that when the person answered,

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:21.739
the brother simply opened his Bible to the questions

00:38:21.739 --> 00:38:23.699
and found a scripture that allowed him

00:38:23.699 --> 00:38:26.059
to continue the conversation?

00:38:26.059 --> 00:38:28.780
And he didn't try to hide what he was doing.

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:31.940
He showed the person the tool he was using.

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:35.260
He felt confident that however the person responded,

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:37.860
he would be able to find a useful scripture

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:40.219
that would keep the conversation moving.

00:38:40.219 --> 00:38:41.900
So that went pretty well.

00:38:43.139 --> 00:38:47.739
But maybe you're thinking it almost never happens

00:38:47.739 --> 00:38:48.900
like that for me.

00:38:50.179 --> 00:38:55.179
Perhaps in our case, it's more like this.

00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:00.739
Hi there, we're asking our neighbors a question

00:39:00.739 --> 00:39:03.099
and we'd love to know your opinion.

00:39:03.099 --> 00:39:05.619
What would you say is something that causes you

00:39:05.659 --> 00:39:07.139
a lot of stress?

00:39:07.139 --> 00:39:10.460
People coming to my door and asking me questions.

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:12.300
I understand.

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:14.579
I'm not a fan of that myself,

00:39:14.579 --> 00:39:18.139
but have you ever wondered why we do this?

00:39:19.739 --> 00:39:21.860
Now at this point, the householder may shut

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:24.059
down the conversation completely.

00:39:24.059 --> 00:39:24.900
And that's fine.

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:27.900
We're not trying to pressure anyone into talking.

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:31.420
But that second question that the publisher asks.

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:34.980
And the fact that he was calm, that he was relaxed

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:37.900
and that he was not taking himself too seriously,

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:41.980
all of that can open the door for the conversation to continue.

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:48.300
To sum up, remember, first, be calm and relaxed.

00:39:50.619 --> 00:39:53.820
We're just trying to start a conversation.

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:55.940
Smile, be friendly.

00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:00.619
Second, ask a question that brings a person

00:40:00.619 --> 00:40:03.260
into the conversation and allows us

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:05.260
to discover what interests them.

00:40:06.739 --> 00:40:09.500
And third, don't be nervous

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:11.619
about where the conversation could lead.

00:40:12.739 --> 00:40:15.780
With our 20 questions for the ministry,

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:19.059
we can be sure that we'll find an appropriate text

00:40:19.059 --> 00:40:21.139
that will keep the conversation directed

00:40:21.139 --> 00:40:24.739
towards spiritual matters.

00:40:24.739 --> 00:40:27.380
This is one of the methods that has helped me

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:30.579
and I hope that it can help you too.

00:40:30.579 --> 00:40:35.940
As you see for yourself how ironed sharpened iron.

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:38.179
Do you sometimes feel like brother Perez

00:40:38.179 --> 00:40:41.739
in the fine that it isn't so easy to walk up to a stranger

00:40:41.739 --> 00:40:43.500
and start a conversation?

00:40:44.579 --> 00:40:46.780
Using the questions in the front of our Bible

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:50.340
may be just what you need to help get a conversation going.

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:54.019
Of course, making disciples takes more than technical

00:40:54.019 --> 00:40:55.699
teaching skill.

00:40:55.699 --> 00:40:59.300
First and foremost, we have to love people

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:02.659
regardless of their race, background, or lifestyle.

00:41:03.619 --> 00:41:07.019
Jehovah is impartial and we have to be the same way

00:41:07.019 --> 00:41:09.860
as we search out deserving ones.

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:12.099
That was the topic of a recent morning worship

00:41:12.099 --> 00:41:14.300
by brother William Turner.

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:17.219
His talk highlights the many ways we need to imitate

00:41:17.219 --> 00:41:21.219
Jehovah's impartiality, not just in our ministry,

00:41:21.219 --> 00:41:23.380
but at all times.

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.820
Well, today's text comments mention the effect

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:29.260
that prejudice had on Jesus' disciples.

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:31.179
And as we think about that today

00:41:31.179 --> 00:41:33.219
and how we are part of an organization

00:41:33.219 --> 00:41:36.739
that is much more diverse than in the first century,

00:41:36.739 --> 00:41:40.059
it raises the question, does prejudice still

00:41:40.059 --> 00:41:42.699
have an impact on God's people today?

00:41:44.539 --> 00:41:47.820
We're very thankful that we love and serve a God

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:50.340
who does not tolerate prejudice.

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:52.099
The Bible states that quite plainly,

00:41:52.099 --> 00:41:56.969
turn with me pleased to the book of Acts.

00:41:56.969 --> 00:42:00.929
And we note the words of the Apostle Peter in Acts chapter 10,

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:06.789
in verse 34, it says that this Peter began to speak

00:42:06.789 --> 00:42:10.869
and he said, now I truly understand

00:42:10.869 --> 00:42:15.869
that God is not partial, but in every nation,

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:19.710
the man who fears him and does what is right

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:21.030
is acceptable to him.

00:42:22.469 --> 00:42:23.829
Now, if you look at the study note,

00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:28.389
it mentions that the Greek phrase for is not partial.

00:42:28.429 --> 00:42:32.829
Literally means is not one who takes faces.

00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:37.190
And that perfectly describes Jehovah, doesn't it?

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:42.190
He does not favor one face, one individual over another

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:46.670
because of their race, nationality, social standing

00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:49.150
or any other external factors.

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:51.989
And that's how you and I strive to be as well.

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:56.869
However, we must acknowledge that it is a challenge

00:42:56.909 --> 00:43:00.909
to be impartial, largely because in today's world,

00:43:00.909 --> 00:43:04.670
we are surrounded by prejudice.

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:07.230
So to answer that question, does prejudice have an impact

00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:08.989
on God's people today?

00:43:08.989 --> 00:43:10.710
Indeed it does.

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:15.710
We may be victims of it, or we ourselves might hold some prejudice.

00:43:17.349 --> 00:43:22.349
Interestingly, the Watchtower back in 2013 made this comment.

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:25.829
It said, if we are honest with ourselves,

00:43:25.829 --> 00:43:28.670
we have to admit that deep down,

00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:33.429
we all harbor varying degrees of prejudice

00:43:33.429 --> 00:43:35.070
in one form or another.

00:43:36.429 --> 00:43:40.469
So if this is something that is a human tendency

00:43:40.469 --> 00:43:43.389
and we're all plagued with it, at least to some degree,

00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:45.949
then how do we overcome it?

00:43:47.389 --> 00:43:50.309
Well, that might be helpful to start with the word itself.

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:52.510
As Sister Lighthizer mentioned,

00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:54.150
the dictionary defines prejudice

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:59.150
as a preconceived opinion that is not based on reason

00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:04.230
or actual experience, a preconceived opinion.

00:44:05.869 --> 00:44:10.349
That has to do with how we think and how we feel,

00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:12.909
thoughts that likely have been shaped

00:44:12.909 --> 00:44:16.670
by our personal experiences, our upbringing,

00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:17.829
and our environment.

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:22.389
And maybe when we think of prejudice, perhaps our minds go to

00:44:22.389 --> 00:44:26.030
where we focus on racial prejudice, hatred,

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:27.750
or animosity towards someone.

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:29.750
We talked a little bit about that last week.

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:34.110
But the Watchtower also mentioned that prejudice

00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:36.230
can also be formed against another person

00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:41.230
because of their weight, gender, language, social status,

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:46.949
religion, or virtually any perceived difference.

00:44:47.989 --> 00:44:51.550
So if prejudice starts with our personality,

00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:55.349
our personal preconceived opinions,

00:44:55.349 --> 00:44:58.949
then the way to overcome it has to start

00:44:58.949 --> 00:45:02.469
by elevating our minds to God's way of thinking.

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:04.750
Again, if we go back to the Bible,

00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:10.230
this time to 1 Samuel chapter 16.

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:13.150
Notice how Jehovah brings this to light.

00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:14.469
1 Samuel chapter 16,

00:45:14.469 --> 00:45:16.590
and let's recall what happens when Samuel goes

00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:21.190
to the house of Jesse to appoint one of his sons as King.

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:24.150
Verse 6, it says,

00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:27.750
as they came in and he saw a light up, he said,

00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:31.949
surely, here before Jehovah stands, is anointed one.

00:45:33.269 --> 00:45:34.710
But Jehovah said to Samuel,

00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:37.789
do not pay attention to his appearance

00:45:37.789 --> 00:45:41.349
and how tall he is before I have rejected him.

00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:45.550
Now if we stop there a moment, did you notice what Samuel did?

00:45:46.789 --> 00:45:50.710
In this particular instance, he was as that Greek phrase

00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:54.750
to note it, a taker of faces, wasn't he?

00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:56.429
He looked at Elias, he saw how tall,

00:45:56.429 --> 00:45:59.550
how handsome he looked, surely this must be Jehovah's choice.

00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:04.769
But note how the verse continues, note to teaching point,

00:46:04.769 --> 00:46:09.210
for the way man sees is not the way God sees,

00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:12.849
because mere man sees what appears to the eyes,

00:46:12.849 --> 00:46:15.769
but Jehovah sees into the heart.

00:46:17.449 --> 00:46:19.409
That's what matters to Jehovah.

00:46:19.409 --> 00:46:20.289
What's in our heart?

00:46:20.289 --> 00:46:22.650
What we are on the inside?

00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:26.449
And he's looking for those qualities in each of us

00:46:26.449 --> 00:46:28.289
that reflect his impartiality.

00:46:29.809 --> 00:46:31.530
Now how has this have benefited to us

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:33.489
since you and I cannot read hearts?

00:46:34.449 --> 00:46:37.050
Well, let's go back to the study note.

00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:40.690
The rest of the study note for Acts 1034 gives us the answer,

00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:45.130
because it says imitating God's impartiality means

00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:48.730
not making surface judgments,

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:53.329
but paying attention to the character and quality of others.

00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:56.329
Now perhaps one way we can illustrate this

00:46:56.329 --> 00:46:59.170
is with the example of a geode.

00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:03.130
Now you look at this picture on its outside surface,

00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:06.929
a geode looks pretty ordinary and nondescript,

00:47:06.929 --> 00:47:10.050
no different than any big rock or stone you'd find outside.

00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:15.849
But if you break it open, all quite a different story.

00:47:15.849 --> 00:47:17.570
Now when you look inside,

00:47:17.570 --> 00:47:22.010
you see these beautiful sparkling crystals of varying colors

00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:25.409
that are just quite beautiful and really radiant to the eye.

00:47:26.969 --> 00:47:28.010
Well, what's our point?

00:47:29.449 --> 00:47:33.090
When we make surface judgments

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:36.449
or preconceived opinions about our brothers,

00:47:36.449 --> 00:47:38.690
often aren't we looking at them

00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:40.889
like the outside of that geode?

00:47:40.889 --> 00:47:43.969
All we see is just the external surface.

00:47:44.969 --> 00:47:50.969
It isn't so true, perhaps if someone is shy, quiet, or reserved,

00:47:50.969 --> 00:47:52.969
it's always in a label them, isn't it?

00:47:52.969 --> 00:47:55.570
We size them up and we quickly come to the conclusion now,

00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:57.969
you know what, that's not much there.

00:47:57.969 --> 00:48:00.369
They really don't have much to offer.

00:48:00.369 --> 00:48:04.170
Or it could be that the person is very talkative, loud, extroverted.

00:48:04.170 --> 00:48:05.170
Same thing.

00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:06.969
We label them for an opinion.

00:48:06.969 --> 00:48:08.769
Could it be in those particular instances

00:48:08.769 --> 00:48:12.369
that we have become a takeer of faces?

00:48:12.369 --> 00:48:16.369
We've made a judgment purely based on personal opinion

00:48:16.369 --> 00:48:19.170
or what we feel is acceptable.

00:48:20.170 --> 00:48:23.969
But to imitate Jehovah's way of thinking,

00:48:23.969 --> 00:48:26.769
we have to go beyond the surface.

00:48:26.769 --> 00:48:31.969
We have to focus on the character and the qualities of our brothers.

00:48:31.969 --> 00:48:34.769
And with some people, that may take time.

00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:38.369
You know what the geode, one expert stated,

00:48:38.369 --> 00:48:41.769
there are many different ways to open a geode.

00:48:41.769 --> 00:48:50.570
But no matter how you do it, the key is patience, patience, patience.

00:48:50.570 --> 00:48:53.369
And in the intro, this is the same with our brothers.

00:48:53.369 --> 00:48:56.769
It takes time and patience to get to know them.

00:48:56.769 --> 00:49:00.369
Time and patience to understand the way that they think

00:49:00.369 --> 00:49:03.570
to show personal interest by asking questions

00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:05.170
to work with them in the ministry

00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:08.369
and to consider their suggestions.

00:49:08.369 --> 00:49:12.170
But when we do, what will reward it?

00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:14.170
We began to see the crystals.

00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:18.369
We began to see their inner beauty inside.

00:49:18.369 --> 00:49:21.570
We discover true depth in our brothers and sisters.

00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:24.570
And hopefully they do in us as well.

00:49:25.369 --> 00:49:26.969
Now going back to Jesus' disciples,

00:49:26.969 --> 00:49:30.769
while the Bible candidly details a number of accounts

00:49:30.769 --> 00:49:34.969
showing their human traits and their prejudicial feelings at times,

00:49:34.969 --> 00:49:39.170
it also highlights how they overcame those feelings.

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:43.969
Just look at how much we read and meditate on the Christian Greek scriptures.

00:49:43.969 --> 00:49:48.769
And how much those verses and books emphasize love,

00:49:48.769 --> 00:49:50.969
opening our hearts, loving our brothers,

00:49:50.969 --> 00:49:54.570
getting along with one another and widening out.

00:49:54.570 --> 00:49:58.369
The disciples did not allow any deep-rooted feelings

00:49:58.369 --> 00:50:04.570
or things from their upbringing or their environment to control them.

00:50:04.570 --> 00:50:07.769
And you and I can be the same.

00:50:07.769 --> 00:50:12.369
But it all starts with an honest self-examination.

00:50:12.369 --> 00:50:17.969
Can I identify any traces of prejudice within me?

00:50:17.969 --> 00:50:22.570
And if we can, well, it all starts with our thinking.

00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:27.369
Elevating our thinking to Jehovah's way of thinking.

00:50:27.369 --> 00:50:31.570
Let's avoid surface judgments, being a taker of faces.

00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:33.570
Let's take the time to get to know our brothers

00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:39.170
and appreciate their character and qualities, their inner beauty.

00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:42.170
Jesus told his disciples at Matthew chapter 23 verse 8,

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:45.170
all of you are brothers.

00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:47.170
And what made them brothers?

00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:48.570
Matthew chapter 12 verse 50,

00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:52.769
Jesus said, for whoever does the will of my father,

00:50:52.769 --> 00:50:58.570
that one is my brother and sister and mother.

00:50:58.570 --> 00:51:00.769
It's a nice reminder, isn't it?

00:51:00.769 --> 00:51:03.570
We are all part of a large spiritual family,

00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:06.769
united by our faith and love for God.

00:51:06.769 --> 00:51:09.170
And if we see each other that way,

00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:11.369
that will help us to remain humble

00:51:11.369 --> 00:51:15.969
and recognize that we have no reason to elevate ourselves above others.

00:51:15.969 --> 00:51:20.369
Instead, we're going to be filled with so much love and appreciation

00:51:20.369 --> 00:51:23.369
to be part of this organization as we imitate

00:51:23.369 --> 00:51:27.769
our impartial God and Father, Jehovah.

00:51:27.769 --> 00:51:32.570
With prejudice and discrimination so rampant in the world around us,

00:51:32.570 --> 00:51:36.769
those reminders couldn't be more timely.

00:51:36.769 --> 00:51:43.170
We've been talking a lot during this broadcast about helping our students become disciples.

00:51:43.170 --> 00:51:44.570
For those of you who are parents,

00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:48.869
your most precious students are, of course, your own children.

00:51:48.869 --> 00:51:51.969
As teachers, we have to help them prepare

00:51:51.969 --> 00:51:54.469
for the pressures they'll face in school.

00:51:54.469 --> 00:51:58.170
And those pressures are more intense now than ever,

00:51:58.170 --> 00:52:02.269
especially when it comes to sexual immorality.

00:52:02.269 --> 00:52:04.469
In this episode of My Teen Life,

00:52:04.469 --> 00:52:10.869
we'll hear from two young people who successfully resisted the temptations to have sex.

00:52:10.869 --> 00:52:13.070
How do they do it?

00:52:19.079 --> 00:52:21.079
Well, every day in high school,

00:52:21.079 --> 00:52:23.280
my classmates would talk about sex.

00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:27.079
They would just talk about their boyfriends and girlfriends,

00:52:27.079 --> 00:52:31.579
what they did with them over the weekend of what they're going to do.

00:52:31.579 --> 00:52:33.980
They, of course, knew that I was one of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:36.679
and that I wouldn't engage in premarital sex,

00:52:36.679 --> 00:52:38.480
but that did not stop them from pushing.

00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:41.579
Guys would invade my personal space.

00:52:41.579 --> 00:52:45.880
Sometimes they would even try to grab or touch me.

00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:48.179
One day, a girl in class,

00:52:48.179 --> 00:52:50.480
she asked me to touch her inappropriately.

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:52.280
Of course, I rejected her,

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:55.380
but she even started resorted to calling me names.

00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:56.880
She called me Lane,

00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:58.880
and she said that I must be gay.

00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:00.880
It seemed to be a game to them

00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:05.280
to try to break me and try to get me to do things with them,

00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:08.280
but the fact that I wouldn't give in,

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:10.880
they thought it was fun or funny.

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:13.880
It got to the point where this became very physical.

00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:16.380
I had two classmates behind me that were pushing me.

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:19.179
One class made on each side of me grabbing my arms

00:53:19.179 --> 00:53:21.380
and pushing me, trying to make me touch her.

00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:24.179
And I knew that it was time to get out of there.

00:53:24.179 --> 00:53:26.480
Being one of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:29.380
I was already very different in school.

00:53:30.579 --> 00:53:32.679
I was also very shy.

00:53:32.679 --> 00:53:36.780
So at times, I wanted to fit in with the crowds

00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:39.780
so I wouldn't have that attention on me.

00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:42.179
But I knew that this would displease Jehovah

00:53:42.179 --> 00:53:44.179
if I went with the crowd

00:53:44.179 --> 00:53:46.179
and did what the other kids were doing.

00:53:46.179 --> 00:53:47.980
Well, I did say I saw a quick side

00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:48.780
and prayed to Jehovah.

00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:50.579
I said, Jehovah, just please help.

00:53:50.579 --> 00:53:53.480
I immediately in my mind thought of Joseph.

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:56.880
He was able to free himself from Potiphar's wife,

00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:57.880
but he was able to get away

00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:00.579
because of his resolve to please Jehovah.

00:54:00.579 --> 00:54:02.880
And that's exactly what I knew I needed to do.

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:04.079
And I did just that.

00:54:04.079 --> 00:54:06.480
I ran right out of the classroom.

00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:10.179
Personal study was very important.

00:54:10.179 --> 00:54:12.880
And this made Jehovah really real to me.

00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:14.679
The more real he was to me,

00:54:14.679 --> 00:54:18.880
the more I didn't want to displease him and hurt him.

00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:20.780
Having that relationship with him

00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:22.179
and having that trust in him

00:54:22.179 --> 00:54:25.480
really helped me get through those situations

00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:28.880
of wanting to fit in and go with the crowd.

00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:31.679
Rejecting that girl was not easy.

00:54:31.679 --> 00:54:34.179
But I did know that it was the right thing to do.

00:54:34.179 --> 00:54:35.579
Shortly before this incident,

00:54:35.579 --> 00:54:38.179
my grandmother actually prepared me.

00:54:38.179 --> 00:54:41.179
She would prepare watchtower articles for me.

00:54:41.179 --> 00:54:43.780
That talked about how to deal with temptation.

00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:47.179
Although those talks with her were super duper awkward.

00:54:48.179 --> 00:54:48.980
If I'm being honest,

00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:51.280
they really helped me to stay spiritually strong

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:52.880
and to resist the temptation.

00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:57.880
My parents always told me to use far-sighted wisdom.

00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:03.880
Think about how that action would affect me in the future.

00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:06.079
Effect my relationship with Jehovah

00:55:06.079 --> 00:55:08.579
with my friends and my family.

00:55:08.579 --> 00:55:12.280
That definitely went through my head a lot during that time.

00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:14.880
All you need to do is trust in Jehovah

00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:17.179
because if you trust in him,

00:55:17.179 --> 00:55:20.380
then everything is going to be okay.

00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:22.880
The publication that really helped me the most

00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:25.679
was The Young People Ask Book Volume 2,

00:55:25.679 --> 00:55:28.679
Chapter 5, Why Stay A Version.

00:55:28.679 --> 00:55:32.179
This book was really a lifesaver for me.

00:55:32.179 --> 00:55:33.880
Reading about how some of my peers

00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:37.679
all around the world are dealing with the exact same temptation

00:55:37.679 --> 00:55:39.579
really gave me a sense of comfort

00:55:39.579 --> 00:55:42.280
and helped me to feel that I was not alone.

00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:44.980
I'm really grateful to Jehovah

00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:49.480
and the organization for the love that they show

00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:51.780
to us young ones to help us.

00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:55.079
You'll not alone and to help us push through

00:55:55.079 --> 00:55:57.380
these difficult situations.

00:55:57.380 --> 00:56:01.579
The Young People Ask Book Volume 2, Chapter 14.

00:56:01.579 --> 00:56:04.579
How can I protect myself at school?

00:56:04.579 --> 00:56:08.179
It really encouraged me in school to be firm

00:56:08.179 --> 00:56:11.679
and to stand my ground to make Jehovah happy.

00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:14.179
Well, I'm so thankful to Jehovah

00:56:14.179 --> 00:56:18.179
for recalling scriptures like 1 Corinthians, Chapter 6, Verse 18

00:56:18.179 --> 00:56:21.179
which says flee from sexual immorality.

00:56:21.179 --> 00:56:23.880
And I'm happy to say that I was able to do just that.

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:25.880
But really, what makes me the happiest

00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:27.980
is knowing that I made Jehovah happy

00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:48.099
and there is no greater feeling than that.

00:56:48.099 --> 00:56:50.099
We know that many of you young ones

00:56:50.099 --> 00:56:52.199
are just like Cameron and Cory

00:56:52.199 --> 00:56:53.400
and we're so proud of you

00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:57.000
for the courageous stand you take every day.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.599
We know it isn't easy.

00:56:58.699 --> 00:57:01.300
But remember, when you take that stand

00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:04.199
you're making Jehovah's Heart Glant.

00:57:05.199 --> 00:57:07.300
It takes courage to be different.

00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:08.900
For many of our brothers and sisters

00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:11.900
at courage is being tested in a special way.

00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:13.900
They're preaching and making disciples

00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:18.500
in lands where the work is restricted or under ban.

00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:21.000
How do they muster the courage to keep

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:24.099
on preaching despite opposition?

00:57:24.099 --> 00:57:35.989
That's the theme of this month's new music video.

00:57:36.090 --> 00:57:42.840
I woke up this morning and dressed for the day.

00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:46.039
I prayed to Jehovah and went on

00:57:46.039 --> 00:57:51.909
while I was told not to preach,

00:57:51.909 --> 00:57:57.119
but I cannot bear.

00:57:57.119 --> 00:58:03.119
God is my ruler, rather than man.

00:58:03.119 --> 00:58:06.119
They're like the breeze blowing

00:58:06.119 --> 00:58:09.619
out in the field of your peace.

00:58:09.619 --> 00:58:12.219
I cried here.

00:58:12.219 --> 00:58:14.820
I know Jehovah's with me.

00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:20.230
So why should I feel?

00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:22.829
I know Jehovah's with me.

00:58:22.829 --> 00:58:28.000
So why should I feel?

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:34.949
As I get back home and think about this day

00:58:34.949 --> 00:58:41.599
that men on the bench had so much to say.

00:58:41.599 --> 00:58:48.840
So I pray that I'll see him again this soon.

00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:53.239
I know it feel better if he had the truth.

00:58:53.239 --> 00:59:01.630
Feel peace.

00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:06.889
Brad, I know Jehovah's with me.

00:59:06.889 --> 00:59:12.630
So why should I feel?

00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:14.829
I know Jehovah's with me.

00:59:14.829 --> 00:59:21.010
So why should I feel?

00:59:21.010 --> 00:59:26.460
Let's burn these words I will speak.

00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:28.460
I'll do my part.

00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:32.260
I'll spread his name the best that I can.

00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:36.260
And I will keep going right down to the end.

00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:39.659
Knowing my brothers are fighting this fight.

00:59:39.659 --> 00:59:41.860
I'll strengthen my faith.

00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:43.659
Keep it alive.

00:59:43.659 --> 00:59:47.460
Trust in Jehovah's praise as I sing.

00:59:47.460 --> 01:00:50.170
Knowing he's in woe to sleep tonight.

01:00:50.170 --> 01:00:55.760
I think Jehovah in turn out.

01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:10.320
But I know that I still don't know.

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:18.920
I could breathe.

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:24.639
I know Jehovah's with me.

01:01:24.639 --> 01:01:41.139
So why should I feel?

01:01:41.139 --> 01:01:43.940
Like the young brother portrayed in our video,

01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:47.539
we can gain confidence knowing that when we're in the ministry,

01:01:47.539 --> 01:01:51.860
Jehovah is with us every step of the way.

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:55.059
Our program has shown us the many ways Jehovah has equipped us

01:01:55.059 --> 01:02:00.659
to make disciples, giving us the best tools and the best training.

01:02:00.659 --> 01:02:04.460
Being a disciple maker also means being courageous

01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:07.860
when it comes to taking a stand for our moral principles.

01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:10.659
And preaching even when opposed.

01:02:10.659 --> 01:02:13.659
We know Jehovah will bless all your hard work

01:02:13.659 --> 01:02:17.059
as you go on making disciples.

01:02:17.059 --> 01:02:20.860
One part of the world where the disciple making work has been thriving

01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:24.260
for well over 100 years is Australia,

01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:29.059
our destination in this month's video postcard.

01:02:29.059 --> 01:02:31.860
Australia is a vast island continent,

01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:35.860
four times larger than the largest island of the world.

01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:38.860
Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans,

01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:42.460
Australia is a land of dramatic contrast.

01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:46.059
It's the second driest continent after Antarctica

01:02:46.059 --> 01:02:48.059
with vast deserts.

01:02:48.059 --> 01:02:51.460
Yet some of its mountain ranges receive enough snow

01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:55.860
to have earned the name the Australian Elps.

01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:58.659
Off the coast of Queensland in the northeast,

01:02:58.659 --> 01:03:00.659
you'll find the Great Barrier Reef,

01:03:00.659 --> 01:03:04.659
which is the largest coral reef system on Earth.

01:03:04.659 --> 01:03:07.460
Whether you're traveling in Australia's dusty outback

01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:09.260
or along the coast,

01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:11.659
you'll likely see many kangaroos.

01:03:11.659 --> 01:03:14.659
That's not surprising because there are many more kangaroos

01:03:14.659 --> 01:03:17.460
in Australia than there are people.

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:19.659
Kangaroos are native to Australia

01:03:19.659 --> 01:03:23.260
as are many other animals including the koala,

01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:25.059
wombat,

01:03:25.059 --> 01:03:27.059
possum,

01:03:27.059 --> 01:03:28.659
emu,

01:03:28.659 --> 01:03:32.059
and the unique duck-billed platypus.

01:03:32.059 --> 01:03:37.460
Seeds of truth reached Australia as far back as 1884.

01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:40.860
The Australia branch was established in 1904,

01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:44.260
making it one of the oldest branches in the world.

01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:47.059
Today it's called the Australasia branch

01:03:47.059 --> 01:03:50.860
and oversees the preaching not just in Australia and New Zealand,

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:54.659
but in many islands of the South Pacific.

01:03:54.659 --> 01:03:56.059
In the early days,

01:03:56.059 --> 01:03:58.860
brothers covered the vast Australian territory

01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:00.659
traveling by bicycle,

01:04:00.659 --> 01:04:01.460
truck,

01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:02.460
cart,

01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:04.860
and even camel.

01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:08.460
Today, more than 70,400 publishers

01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:11.260
and 7,500 pioneers

01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:14.460
are preaching in almost 40 different languages.

01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:19.460
A special effort is made to reach Australia's native Aboriginal people.

01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:21.460
To assist those hungry for the truth,

01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:26.059
literature has been translated into some of the indigenous languages.

01:04:26.059 --> 01:04:28.260
Our Australian brothers and sisters

01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:32.059
have also found success preaching on passenger trains

01:04:32.059 --> 01:04:34.260
and at railway stations.

01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:36.659
This is the Broken Hill Station,

01:04:36.659 --> 01:04:39.260
a stop on the Indian Pacific route,

01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:42.059
which runs more than 4,300 kilometers

01:04:42.059 --> 01:04:46.260
or about 2,700 miles from Sydney to Perth.

01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:49.059
Many have learned the truth as a result of the preaching

01:04:49.059 --> 01:04:51.659
along this train line.

01:04:51.659 --> 01:04:54.659
Most of Australia's nearly 26 million inhabitants

01:04:54.659 --> 01:04:57.860
live in cities and towns not far from the coast.

01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:00.059
One of those towns is Naurah,

01:05:00.059 --> 01:05:03.460
home of the Naurah West congregation.

01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:05.260
With a little help from Zoom,

01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:09.059
the 80 brothers and sisters of the Naurah West congregation

01:05:09.059 --> 01:05:12.260
send you their warmest love.

01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:15.059
From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

01:05:15.059 --> 01:05:17.260
this is JW Broadcasting.
