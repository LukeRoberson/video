00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:07.599
Our theme scripture today is 1 Timothy chapter 4 and verse 16, and it contains the phrase,

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:15.439
pay constant attention to your teaching. Now, we may read that often, it rolls off the tongue,

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:22.079
but are we doing it? I know in preparing this, preparing this morning worship, I had asked myself

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:30.079
the same question, what am I doing to actively pay constant attention to my teaching? Well, the answer

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:36.560
was sobering. In these, especially during these last two years, we may have lost some focus,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.759
but for brothers, perhaps we've not had an opportunity to prepare as many new talks,

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:47.679
because of not having normal assemblies or conventions, or perhaps we've fallen into the habit

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:52.799
of just reading our notes right off the screen, like a manuscript, when giving a talk on Zoom,

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:59.039
and thus have drifted away from working off of an outline. Or for all of us,

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.799
perhaps our ministry has fallen into a bit of a routine, we're just letter writing,

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:10.719
and leaving messages on machines. Well, even in these unique times, we need to pay constant

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:17.120
attention to our teaching. Now, more than ever, we need to help others to build faith in Jehovah,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.920
in His Son, and in His organization. So with that in mind, let's consider two points that can help us

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.840
give attention to our teaching. The first is meditating on Jehovah's perfect example,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.959
and the second is using tools that can help us teach like Jehovah does. So let's look at our

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:42.000
first point. Look at Jehovah's example. As we know, he sets a perfect example of what it means

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.560
to be a teacher. We may think of the scripture in Isaiah chapter 48 and verse 17, and let's

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:56.269
read that together, Isaiah chapter 48 and verse 17, this is what Jehovah says,

00:01:56.269 --> 00:02:04.030
your repurchaser, the Holy One of Israel, I Jehovah, am your God, the one teaching you

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:12.349
to benefit yourself, the one guiding you in the way you should walk. He teaches, and he guides.

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:19.389
Now, we can meditate for hours on Jehovah's perfect example of how he teaches, how he guides,

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:27.069
how he reaches hearts. We may think of how he corrected the thinking of ones like Job and Jonah

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.310
and others when their thinking was way out of line. Now, what did Jehovah do? He could have given

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.669
them a long lecture, he could have given them a long dissertation explaining all the ways their

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:42.990
thinking was out of line, but he didn't do that. A few well-chosen questions and a simple

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.189
application, which immediately went to the heart, beautiful example of teaching. Jehovah also

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:56.509
uses illustrations and visual effects in his teaching. We may think of the illustration as

00:02:56.509 --> 00:03:04.270
record in Isaiah chapter 44, verses 14 through 17. That's where the man cuts down a tree,

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.469
takes some of the wood and uses it to burn in the fire, to cook his food, and then he takes another

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.389
piece of wood and he carves it into an idol and bows down to it, immediate impact showing the

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:23.229
futility of trying to think that idols can help us. Or what about the visions, the live action videos,

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:29.469
if you will, that he gave to Ezekiel, Daniel, and others, and how that has such a powerful impact on

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:36.509
them? See, Jehovah knows the impact and the power of illustrations and visual effects.

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:44.830
And Jehovah has the perfect example of how to guide someone to come to the right conclusion

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:53.069
and reach their heart. That's an art. He teaches and he guides. So can we work to better imitate

00:03:53.069 --> 00:04:00.030
Jehovah's methods? Now, Jehovah also dignifies us when he trains us. How does he do that? Well, that's

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:06.990
part of his aspect of guiding. In fact, notice if you will go back to Isaiah chapter 30, and notice

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:15.229
what it says when speaking of our grand instructor, Isaiah 30, in verse 21, and your own ears will hear

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:22.350
a word behind you saying, this is the way, walk in it, in case you should go to the right, or in case

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:30.509
you should go to the left. Now, if you ever wondered, why is the word behind us? But why isn't in

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:35.069
front of us? It wouldn't be so much easier if Jehovah just told us, just do this and do it this way

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:41.870
and everything will be okay. But he doesn't do that. He dignifies us. See, he gives us instructions,

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:48.509
and then he allows us to set a path to apply it based on our own individuality, our own

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:53.389
creativity. However, he's there. That voice is behind us, the words behind us, to give us a

00:04:53.389 --> 00:05:00.189
nudge and further guidance in case we drift too far off to the left or to the right. And why is

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:05.629
that? Well, Jehovah knows that humans benefit the most, that we learn the most, not when just

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:11.550
following a prescribed set of rules, memorizing things, or rather receiving principled guidance,

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:17.790
and then being able to apply the instruction, all the while having somebody to guide us to

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.829
mentor us, if you will, in case we go too far to the left or the right.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:30.670
Well, are we giving attention so that we better imitate Jehovah's methods of teaching and guiding?

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:36.430
Well, what can help us to do so? Well, that brings us to our second point. At Jehovah's

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:43.629
Organization has provided wonderful tools that really capture Jehovah's advanced methods of

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:48.750
teaching and guiding can help us improve our teaching. Let's just consider two of them.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:55.149
The first is our beautiful new book, Enjoy Life Forever. And when you think about it, this

00:05:55.149 --> 00:06:03.709
publication incorporates the same techniques that Jehovah uses. It includes well-chosen questions,

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:11.389
simple illustrations, visual aids in the form of pictures and videos that reach hearts.

00:06:12.269 --> 00:06:17.310
Well, are we using this tool not just to study and help ones come to know about Jehovah,

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:24.430
but to train ourselves to teach more like Jehovah does? See, am I mastering the technique of

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:30.829
drawing out the student? Where do I find I still do most of the talking or fall back into just

00:06:30.829 --> 00:06:38.029
question and answer? Now, if we've not done so already, take some time to study the S196,

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:43.870
using Enjoy Life Forever in the Ministry guidelines. It's there on the screen. If it doesn't look

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:49.870
familiar to you, then ask your elders for a copy. And notice what it says in paragraph seven.

00:06:50.829 --> 00:06:58.509
It says the publications are designed to promote meaningful discussions. The discussion should be

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:04.509
a natural conversation rather than a formal question and answer consideration of the material.

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:09.389
And you notice the end of paragraph eight, it is best to avoid talking too much.

00:07:10.269 --> 00:07:15.709
And at the end of the guidelines is other references that we can use and follow that can train us

00:07:15.709 --> 00:07:21.870
further. So is this a good topic for a few of our family worship nights? But what else can we do?

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:28.509
What could we have someone experience join our study and ask them to observe how we're doing?

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:35.389
Do we talk too much? Am I letting the student reason, giving them time to reason and come to the

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:41.230
conclusion on their own? If I don't have a study, can I ask to join somebody else's study and see

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:48.350
how they do it? Can I look for ways to incorporate these techniques maybe when I'm comforting somebody,

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:53.550
or I'm on a shepherding call or during our family worship when training somebody? See,

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:58.269
these are just some examples of how we can use this beautiful new tool, not only in our ministry,

00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:05.470
to help ones in the in the territory, but to actively work on our teaching and improve our teaching.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:12.110
What's another tool we have? Well, we have the beautiful apply yourself to reading and teaching

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:19.870
brochure. And this contains very simple straightforward points of how to imitate Jehovah's methods.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:25.709
As we go through the table of contents, we see how it explains how we use questions, illustrations,

00:08:25.709 --> 00:08:30.990
how we can make main points stand out and many others. And as we remember, this has beautiful

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:36.990
videos, very powerful, simple videos that show the right and wrong way to apply the points.

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:43.710
Well, one was the last time we went through the brochure and watched the videos. For us,

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:51.789
brothers, what specific point am I working on for my next public talk? Can I also give more attention

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:57.309
to my treasures from God's word part, assignment in the midweek meeting? If you look at that,

00:08:57.309 --> 00:09:02.669
that part is a beautiful example that trains us on how to prepare a talk from an outline.

00:09:03.389 --> 00:09:09.230
How am I doing? Am I taking advantage of that? Can I use these techniques when giving a safety talk

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:15.309
or another talk in my department or for my crew? And as we've gone through that brochure, we know that

00:09:15.309 --> 00:09:21.710
in looking at it, we can apply many of these points also in our ministry when comforting others

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:27.470
when witnessing to our relatives and when training others for more responsibility. And see,

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:34.190
we've only scratched the surface, but we get the point. We have many opportunities to improve our

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:40.429
teaching. And how happy we are that Jehovah has raised up a faith on the screen slave to

00:09:40.429 --> 00:09:46.590
who continues to provide outstanding tools to help us. We've just considered two of them,

00:09:46.669 --> 00:09:53.389
and there are others. As recorded at Hebrews chapter 5 and verse 12, the apostle Paul told the

00:09:53.389 --> 00:10:00.590
first century Christians, he said that by now, or as the footnote says, in view of the times,

00:10:01.389 --> 00:10:08.350
you should be teachers. Well, how much more so do those words apply to us by now? In view of

00:10:08.429 --> 00:10:16.830
the times, we must be teachers. So now it's up to us. May we continue to follow Jehovah's perfect

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:23.870
example of teaching and guiding? And may we fully utilize the beautiful tools provided for us

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:31.309
by Jehovah's organization? Yes, may each one of us do our part and pay constant attention to our

00:10:31.309 --> 00:10:33.389
teaching.
