WEBVTT

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:08.130
Oh, one of the blessings of this week is having our missionaries with us.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.529
And as Mother Morris mentioned, we have Eric and Tres Hartman.

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:17.809
And they're serving in a Navajo field in Shiprock, New Mexico.

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:23.530
So thank you for taking some time to allow us to get to know you.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.609
Maybe you could just kind of start off with where you're from, how you came in the truth.

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:29.609
Okay.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.810
Was baptized when I was 17, raised in the truth in Spokane, Washington?

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.369
And I'm from Sedona, Arizona originally also raised in the truth.

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:41.969
And a pioneer sister studied with me and I was baptized when I was 14.

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.929
Very nice. Good.

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:47.530
As was mentioned to you serving with a Navajo field.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.530
And when that was mentioned, everyone went, oh, we're anxious to kind of hear a little bit about that.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.770
But how did you end up on the reservation?

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.130
When I was 18, I was looking for somewhere to go and something to do.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.769
And the circuit overseer had asked two families from my congregation to move to Chimley, Arizona

00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:10.049
on the reservation to form the fourth congregation there.

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.250
They moved and I visited them and two months later I moved as well.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.969
And Tres and I met in Sedona, Arizona.

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:21.450
I was in my first year of pioneering and it was before she moved to the reservation.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.969
And then I came to Brooklyn Bethel and then later,

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:29.930
Wal-Kill and then I left Wal-Kill in 2000 and then we were married in 2001.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.090
Good. Nice.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.010
So then, let's see, I understand you started full-time service around 94.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.290
I think Tres was 97.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.849
Then you went through the 131st class of Gilead and graduated in 2011.

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:45.569
I know that was a nice experience.

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:49.049
What sparked your interest in missionary service?

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.849
Well, for me, when we were in the Navajo field, the territory there was so much work to do.

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:57.170
And we really came to love the field.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.489
And we invested a lot of effort into the language and it's not a language that you can use anywhere else.

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:07.650
So the more invested we became in the territory, the harder it was to think about leaving it.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:14.289
But we had some friends that were missionaries and they encouraged us to put our trust in Jehovah and reach out.

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:17.490
And for me, I loved the field so much.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.530
But because Eric had been in special full-time service previously,

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.169
he knew what it was to give everything to Jehovah all of your time.

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:30.409
And it's very hard to make a living on the reservation as a non-native, especially.

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:34.930
And so if we could give Jehovah everything, we knew we could accomplish so much more.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.889
So it took some convincing, even for Gilead, for me to leave this field.

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:41.849
But when we were accepted, we were thrilled.

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.409
Yeah, well, you know, you say it took some convincing to leave the field.

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:48.569
Because you loved it so much, both of you.

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:55.370
But now you go through Gilead and then you get this assignment to the United States.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.289
What was your reaction to that?

00:02:57.289 --> 00:03:00.009
Well, honestly, when the instructors handed us our letter,

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:04.050
I was just looking for where our assignment was and what we were going to be doing.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.449
And when I saw a missionary serving in the Navajo field,

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:09.530
we both burst into tears.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.689
And our instructors asked right away, are you happy?

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:15.810
Obviously, we were very happy.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.050
We didn't even know it was possible to be assigned as missionaries in the US.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.930
But it has helped us so much and it has helped the field so much.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.409
It's been a wonderful gift.

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:25.129
Very nice.

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.930
Good.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:32.449
So Eric, you just think back to those lessons in Gilead.

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:36.409
And then you're in your assignment now.

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:42.250
Make the connection between what you learned and how you're applying it in your missionary service.

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:46.969
One of the lessons we're encouraged with was to work ourselves out of a job.

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:50.409
And so we've really tried to focus our attention on

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:53.530
involving the Navajo brothers and sisters in the work.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.409
And what that's done is it's really helped them to rely on Jehovah and not merely on us.

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:02.210
And it really creates stability within the field.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.409
So even as we think about that advice,

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:09.169
it's really proving helpful as things move forward.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.770
For me, a catchphrase from Gilead that sticks with me is to shovel the coal.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.569
Meaning we are not on deck with the captain.

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:18.569
We are in the bowels of the ship.

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:20.209
And our job is the grant labor.

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.970
And it's not up to us to ask or question why the captain says to do one thing or another.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.410
For me, that's been very helpful personally,

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.610
because so much has changed in our field in three years.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.810
I wish that it had happened 30 years ago, but it didn't.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.769
And so it's not my job to say why not?

00:04:38.769 --> 00:04:40.889
It's my job to shovel the coal.

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.769
Trust the captain and just keep doing my work so we can go full steam ahead.

00:04:44.769 --> 00:04:46.610
Those are good lessons, aren't they?

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.209
So as was mentioned, you're working in Shiprock.

00:04:49.209 --> 00:04:52.810
You're working with the Navajo.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.089
What is that like?

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:56.050
What's the reservation like?

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.569
What's it like working in the ministry among those the Navajo people?

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:03.329
Well, the Navajo reservation is a vast area.

00:05:03.329 --> 00:05:07.050
It covers parts of New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.569
27,000 square miles.

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:12.730
There's 300,000 Navajo people on the reservation,

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.009
and about 75% speak Navajo at home.

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:16.689
Amazing.

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:20.490
And Navajo people, people, most when they first meet them,

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.329
think, oh, they're so shy or so deadpan, they only are with strangers or with outsiders.

00:05:25.329 --> 00:05:30.050
But once you get to know them, they just open up and they love to laugh and to tease.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.529
They're so much fun.

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:35.129
And the language really helps open up that part of their personality.

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:36.529
It's nice.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.889
How long has the work been going on there in that area?

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:46.769
Well, the preaching work has really been building momentum for decades.

00:05:46.769 --> 00:05:51.970
In the 70s, the first English congregation was established in Tupaciti, Arizona.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:57.569
And now there's six congregations on the reservation and 13 around the borders.

00:05:57.569 --> 00:05:59.569
Interesting.

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:05.009
And then for the first Navajo witness that we know of that was baptized,

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:08.050
was in the 1950s, off reservation.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.769
But the work has progressed, and now there's between two to 300 Navajo brothers and sisters.

00:06:12.769 --> 00:06:13.769
Good.

00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:14.769
So how has the work changed?

00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:18.449
How has the preaching work changed over the years?

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:21.930
I've been there 18 years now, and it has changed tremendously.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.250
You can't even recognize it from the way it used to be.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:30.250
At first, everything was in English, all the meetings, most of the ministry.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.889
We had a few, if any, Navajo publications available.

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:40.050
But now we have an RTO that supplies us with wonderful literature that we use constantly.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.889
And using the language in the more, more in the field has transformed everything.

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:50.810
And when I arrived on the res in 2000, same thing, all the congregations were in English.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.649
The preaching work was basically in English, except the Navajo publishers.

00:06:54.649 --> 00:07:03.250
And so at this point, you really see even with the two branch language classes in 2001 and 2003,

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:09.170
because of the difficulty of the language, it was hard for the pioneers to take it to the field, even afterwards.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.569
But now it's really beginning to change.

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:12.069
Good.

00:07:12.069 --> 00:07:15.410
All right, so there was growth in the beginning, slow.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:19.410
But what has helped to speed up the growth?

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:24.689
Well, the words of Isaiah 60 and verse 22 have really proved to be true.

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:29.370
I myself Jehovah shall speed it up in its own time.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:35.209
And he uses his organization to shift obstacles that before seemed impossible to move.

00:07:35.209 --> 00:07:40.250
One of the things that's really, really helped us is in the past, probably two years,

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:45.209
we've received so many couples from the couple school.

00:07:45.209 --> 00:07:50.529
And that we went from having five special pioneers in the field to having 25 in the field.

00:07:50.529 --> 00:07:53.089
And it really, it strengthens the congregations.

00:07:53.089 --> 00:07:57.810
It helps the other need graders there see the importance of learning the language and using it.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:59.689
And it just gives that stability.

00:07:59.689 --> 00:08:05.730
But for the Navajo friends, it really makes them feel special and feel like they really are at home in Jehovah's organization.

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:12.490
Yeah, and I think we received four more couples this past weekend, one for the Hopi language.

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:20.129
Over the past three years, that shift towards the Navajo language has really helped the Navajo brothers and sisters.

00:08:20.129 --> 00:08:25.569
Now there's four Navajo congregations, seven groups and two pre-groups.

00:08:25.569 --> 00:08:30.649
And all of that is a huge help in stabilizing the faith of the brothers.

00:08:30.649 --> 00:08:31.810
Very good, very nice.

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:35.450
So it's nice and encouraging to see what's taking place there.

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:46.129
One of the things that Trez mentioned earlier was increase has taken place because they're hearing the truth and the language of their heart.

00:08:46.129 --> 00:08:51.289
Can you, can you, do you have an experience that illustrates that point?

00:08:51.289 --> 00:08:57.570
This illustration really shows how much the publications affect the hearts of people.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:04.850
One sister in our congregation, she was out in the ministry, had a nice call, placed a list in the God brochure in Navajo.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:11.730
And she wrote down the information, but then when she went home, her granddaughter got into her service bag and tore out that page.

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:14.169
And our sister has tons of calls.

00:09:14.169 --> 00:09:18.409
So for her to know that she was missing this woman, it didn't happen.

00:09:18.409 --> 00:09:22.129
But meanwhile, that woman was reading the publications.

00:09:22.129 --> 00:09:29.049
And she started to realize that her involvement with the peyote religion was wrong and Jehovah was not pleased with it.

00:09:29.049 --> 00:09:35.129
And so in time, as she thought about that, she began to realize that she needed to get rid of the peyote music.

00:09:35.129 --> 00:09:38.210
She even took her son's teepee and burned it in the fire.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.730
You have to realize this woman hadn't even had a study.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:45.809
She's just reading it and coming to know Jehovah through the publications.

00:09:45.809 --> 00:09:51.250
Now, at this point, our sister still doesn't know that this woman is out there.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:57.450
So our sister is working at a public witnessing cart in a flea market in the town we live in.

00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:02.009
And all of a sudden, this Navajo woman calls out, she says, this is it.

00:10:02.009 --> 00:10:03.169
This is the truth.

00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:08.809
She's yelling to her son because she had seen the list in the God brochure on the cart.

00:10:08.809 --> 00:10:13.049
And so now she can have a study and the publication.

00:10:13.049 --> 00:10:14.409
Isn't that something very nice?

00:10:14.409 --> 00:10:16.370
Thank you, Eric, for sharing that.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:23.250
So I understand that on October 25th, you had the first Navajo assembly.

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:24.649
What was that like, Eric?

00:10:24.649 --> 00:10:27.370
It was absolutely amazing.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:35.370
Partially because there was people from tribes all over Canada, the Americas, even Mexico,

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:47.009
just to name a few Navajo, Hopi, Zuni, Laguna, Akima, Wallapai, Apache, the Neh, Ojibwa, Cherokee,

00:10:47.009 --> 00:10:55.370
Kree, Kayawa, Kikapoo, Spokane, Blackfoot, it keeps going.

00:10:55.370 --> 00:11:03.730
One count, there was people from 24 states and 26 tribes represented at the assembly.

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:09.490
And we also had Native Americans from three different countries, like we mentioned in

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:12.090
US, Canada, and Mexico.

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:15.009
Even the young ones really enjoyed the program.

00:11:15.009 --> 00:11:18.330
And we had Brother Bro from the branch committee there for the occasion.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:22.049
There was 1333 in attendance.

00:11:22.049 --> 00:11:26.490
And this was the first time that many of the Navajo brothers and sisters had heard a program

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:29.169
almost entirely in Navajo.

00:11:29.169 --> 00:11:34.730
In fact, one of the Bible students in the middle of the assembly just set out loud.

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.450
This is such a great program.

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:38.250
I'm learning so much.

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:40.450
That's nice.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.289
It was really reaching the heart.

00:11:42.289 --> 00:11:46.250
What about that 83-year-old sister?

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:50.090
We had one sister baptize a Masana, as they call it, grandmother's.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:51.610
She was 83.

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:57.169
Her name was Rose Sennagini, and she had been studying off and on in English only since

00:11:57.169 --> 00:12:00.769
the 1970s, without making much progress.

00:12:00.769 --> 00:12:05.169
So finally, one of our special Pioneer brothers from the B.S.C.C. took matters in his hands

00:12:05.169 --> 00:12:07.649
and he said, she needs to study in Navajo.

00:12:07.649 --> 00:12:12.289
And we do not have the Bible Teachbook or the God's Lovebook in Navajo.

00:12:12.289 --> 00:12:16.649
And both the study and the sister assigned to study with her were both learning how to

00:12:16.649 --> 00:12:18.009
read their language.

00:12:18.009 --> 00:12:22.190
So she had to translate, as she went on the study, they would work through the scriptures

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:26.049
together and they would high-five each other when they figured out the scripture.

00:12:26.049 --> 00:12:30.529
And in that way, she was able to progress to baptism in just a year and a half.

00:12:30.529 --> 00:12:33.529
And it was an exciting event to have her baptized.

00:12:33.529 --> 00:12:34.529
Very nice.

00:12:34.529 --> 00:12:35.529
That's exciting.

00:12:35.529 --> 00:12:40.129
Very good experience has taken place there, and we appreciate that.

00:12:40.129 --> 00:12:47.049
How has your missionary service increased your faith, strengthened your faith, and strengthened

00:12:47.049 --> 00:12:50.580
your love for Jehovah?

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:56.860
Well for me, this assignment has really shown me that Jehovah knows me.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.220
He knows who I am, and he knows what I love.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.940
But he also knows the needs of the field.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:06.059
And when he can put those two things together, it's a wonderful thing.

00:13:06.059 --> 00:13:09.460
And so when I face challenges in my assignment, I remember that.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.460
Jehovah knows me.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:14.360
He knows what I love, and he knows the field, and put that together and beautiful things

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.360
happen.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.360
What about you, Eric?

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:20.779
For me, early on one brother at Bethel said that no one brother here at Bethel knows

00:13:20.779 --> 00:13:23.019
what the next step needs to be.

00:13:23.019 --> 00:13:25.019
But Jehovah does.

00:13:25.019 --> 00:13:31.019
And seeing that has really built my confidence because the amount of work and the obstacles

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:33.059
that need to be overcome are huge.

00:13:33.059 --> 00:13:37.419
But Jehovah's ability to do that, just like the scripture said, he's speeding it up in

00:13:37.419 --> 00:13:38.419
his own time.

00:13:38.419 --> 00:13:39.419
That's true.

00:13:39.419 --> 00:13:44.419
Well, you know, I know we could go on and on, we've shared a lot.

00:13:44.419 --> 00:13:46.820
And we've been very encouraged by your comments.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.659
So we thank you for your service.

00:13:48.659 --> 00:13:51.539
We thank the other missionaries for their fine service.

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:56.460
And we prayed Jehovah's blessings will be with you and them as you continue faithfully

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.340
serving Jehovah in your assignments.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:13:59.700
All to his praise and glory.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:00.460
Thank you very much.
