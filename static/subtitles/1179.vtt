00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:09.859
The reason I immigrated here was to earn more money and more freedom, but my life was

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:14.179
only work and sleep.

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.379
I was thought, this is not the reason I came here.

00:00:18.379 --> 00:00:23.460
This is not the life I wanted, but what could I do?

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.910
The life that I was pursuing did not bring me true happiness.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.350
My husband's sister started taking me along to the meetings.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.590
The brothers and sisters there were very welcoming to me.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.030
My wife started studying the Bible first.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.030
I saw her becoming happier and happier studying the Bible, and this motivated me to start

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.750
studying the Bible with her Bible teacher.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.549
She lived far away, but she was never late.

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:58.590
She was like a mother and cared for us like her children.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.109
In our studies, we were making huge progress.

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:08.659
But we didn't expect the huge challenge that lay ahead.

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.379
When my youngest daughter was born, the doctor told us she had congenital heart disease.

00:01:14.379 --> 00:01:17.260
She needed immediate surgery.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.939
When we were facing this challenge, the brothers and sisters were right by our side, continually

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:29.140
assisting us, helping us to find a doctor and interpreting for us, even though we were

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.939
not yet baptized.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.859
On the day of the surgery, a congregation elder and his wife drove to pick us up and brought

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:38.379
us to the hospital.

00:01:38.379 --> 00:01:42.780
They also stayed by our side until the surgery was done.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.140
A couple came to the hospital and brought us food.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.540
Another sister helped to care for my older daughter.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.540
We really could feel that the brothers and sisters really loved us, just like family.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.739
My wife and I, along with our two daughters, are very happy to be worshiping Jehovah.

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:06.060
I realized that the love shown to me by the brothers and sisters was an imitation of

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.060
Jehovah.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.900
It really helped me to see that this is truly his organization.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.340
This is the life that we have been searching for.
