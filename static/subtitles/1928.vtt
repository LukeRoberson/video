00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:07.330
From the beginning of history, Jehovah God revealed his name to mankind.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:14.330
He inspired the original Bible writers to record that name some 7000 times in the scriptures.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.329
However, only a few people had access to copies of the Bible,

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:26.329
and as it was translated into other languages, God's name Jehovah began to be removed from the text.

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:36.070
For many centuries, Bible manuscripts were produced one copy at a time.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:42.070
Then in the 15th century, the Bible was first printed on a press using movable type.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.070
At last, Bibles could be produced in large quantities.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:56.710
There was also a need for Bible translation into the common languages.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:06.060
Despite religious opposition, 16th century scholar William Tendell became the first to translate the New Testament

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.060
and portions of the Old Testament directly into English from the original languages.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.060
He was the first English translator to use the name Jehovah.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.060
To highlight the fascinating history of the divine name and its rightful place within the Bible,

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.060
Jehovah's Witnesses opened a new exhibit at their headquarters in Brooklyn, New York.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.060
The governing body was interested in having a display that would be appropriate for people of all ages, of all backgrounds,

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:45.060
that would help them to see the undeniable place of God's name Jehovah in the Bible.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:56.060
The divine name came to us from the pages of the Bible, yet over the centuries it has come and gone based off of various religious beliefs.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:03.060
When people leave out the name of Jehovah, you don't have the possibility of building a relationship with Jehovah.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:12.060
So when the Bible contains so many times the name Jehovah, you read the Bible with an open heart, then automatically you're drawn closer to Jehovah.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:20.569
The search for Bibles started right with their own librarians here at Bethel.

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.569
And once people heard about the exhibit, we began to receive Bibles from all over the world.

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:40.509
It's very exciting to receive a Bible that was printed in the 16th or 17th century.

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:54.969
Some of the leaves have beautiful, beautiful coloring. That coloring would have had to have been done by hand very meticulously.

00:02:55.969 --> 00:03:02.969
Sometimes they may not use Jehovah's name, and yet on the title page, you'll see the Tetramatine.

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:20.430
One item I particularly enjoy is the Nuremberg Polyglum, because it has 12 languages all presented so that you can see each verse in all 12 languages.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:27.430
And it helps you appreciate that other scholars have seen the importance of rendering the divine name in the New Testament.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.430
Some of these Bibles were in desperate need of repair, required that we learned how these books were originally bound.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:43.620
These were handcrafted Bibles, and they were made with all natural materials from their time period.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:58.139
These Bibles were meant to last. The same loving, caring effort has been placed in making the revised New World Translation.

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:08.219
In Jeremiah chapter 23 verse 27, Jehovah said they intend to make my people forget my name.

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:15.729
How different are Jehovah's faithful servants because we love Jehovah's name.

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:28.240
This Bible display helps us to see how Jehovah's name has been preserved in translations down through the ages.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:37.819
We know that when you come to visit, your love for Jehovah's name will also be enhanced.
