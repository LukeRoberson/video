00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:07.339
From 92 to 93 I worked in a technical assistance company.

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:12.740
After a while my boss would ask me to lie to the clients telling them that they would

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.460
receive new parts when actually they were refurbished parts, so I said no way.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.660
I wouldn't do that.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.339
I said I'd prefer to be fired than to do something that would displease Jehovah.

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:30.620
Not only that, but my supervisor was verbally abusive.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:36.259
Sometimes he would throw my lunch in the trash on purpose just to be mean.

00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:39.179
Sometime later my supervisor became very sick.

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:42.579
I made the most of the opportunity to witness to him.

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.939
He said that he had moved from the neighborhood, was studying the Bible, and that the brothers

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:49.500
were visiting him at his home.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.619
Before he died, he said that he was very happy that he was learning about Jehovah.

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:59.659
He showed me that with Jehovah's help, we can keep our integrity and also help others

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:03.380
to get to know him.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.500
When I started my training as a bank clerk, my being one of Jehovah's witnesses didn't

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.819
seem to be a problem initially.

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:12.939
Not much later though, my superior called me in.

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:17.340
She told me it actually would be a problem if customers saw me in the ministry and that

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.739
I should simply stop preaching.

00:01:19.739 --> 00:01:24.379
I explained to her that I never intended to harm my employer's interests, but to stop

00:01:24.379 --> 00:01:27.299
preaching, I could not do that.

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.980
I was still in my employment probation period.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.700
Two weeks later, I was summoned to the Human Resources Department at the bank's headquarters.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.980
They politely requested I quit preaching.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.500
I should think twice about what was more important to me, my employer's interests or my ministry.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.180
I respectfully explained that to me, Jehovah is the most important and that I would continue

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.540
preaching.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.739
My probation period ended.

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:55.180
My training continued and during the rest of my apprenticeship, it was never mentioned

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.180
again.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.579
I am really grateful to Jehovah.

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.500
It was he who gave me the strength not to compromise.
