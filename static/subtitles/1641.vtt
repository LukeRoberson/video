00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:17.260
The prophet Isaiah foretold that in the final part of the days, nations would stream to

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:26.140
the mountain of Jehovah, his elevated pure worship, to be instructed about his ways.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.899
In God's organization, we can all benefit from that divine education.

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:40.549
We also see the results of Proverbs chapter 4 verse 18.

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:49.710
The path of the righteous is like the bright morning light that grows brighter and brighter.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.590
Naturally, what we learn through the program of divine education has to keep pace with

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.119
our refined understanding of Bible teachings.

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:06.599
To accomplish this, the teaching committee of the governing body oversees the work of

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:12.400
the Theocratic schools department in Patterson, New York.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:19.599
How do they keep the curriculums of our Theocratic schools up to date and effective in training

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:25.700
God's people to do His will?

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.739
In the fall of 1942, Brother Nathan nor wondered if a thousand pioneers could be found

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:35.700
who would be willing to go through Gilead to ensure the school's operation for at least

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.299
five years.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.859
Nearly 80 years later, Gilead's school is still going strong.

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:47.500
And it's not alone.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.939
The Theocratic schools department develops and maintains seven schools under the direction

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:53.780
of the teaching committee.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.620
Together, these schools train God's people for Theocratic assignments around the world.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.099
But each school's curriculum needs continual review and updating.

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:05.900
Why?

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.020
We may receive new direction for a school from the governing body, or need to integrate

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.780
Bible teachings from new or updated publications.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.620
Thanks to Jehovah's rich blessing, Theocratic schools are being conducted in 93 branch territories

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.699
and 293 languages.

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:30.219
The amazing growth of these schools produces a mammoth amount of work behind the scenes.

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:35.500
There are more than 2,000 documents that need to be put through a robust process of formatting,

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.539
proofreading, editing, cross-checking for redundancy and internal indexing.

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:45.939
Additionally, thousands of reference checks that include scripture citations and publication

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:47.819
references are made.

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:54.180
The schools are dynamic, so this work is continuous to keep them up to date, accurate,

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.939
and harmonious.

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:01.620
Once revisions are identified, the affected teaching outlines are adjusted.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.939
Often when a school is revised, a pilot class is taught.

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:10.580
Brothers from the schools department can observe and listen to comments and suggestions from

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.379
the instructors.

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:17.219
They can then make further adjustments before the updated schools taught worldwide.

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:22.300
The Theocratic schools are having a far-reaching effect.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.870
How do the students feel about their training?

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.550
The training we received at Giliat was a big help for my new assignment as a member of

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:34.550
the branch committee.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.990
It helped me not to be rule-oriented or position-oriented.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:47.310
It helped me to understand how Jehovah wants me to use authority, to treat our brothers

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:55.669
and sisters in a humble, in a friend, in a loving way, to really take care of his sheep.

00:03:55.669 --> 00:04:00.310
In October 2018, a special announcement was made.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:08.750
We are pleased to inform you that the governing body has given approval for all field missionaries

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:18.829
with an FMF enrollment who have been serving for at least five years to attend the School

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.990
of Kingdom Evangelizers SKE.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.029
SKE was very much a refresher course for us.

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:32.350
It helped us to be able to bring back to mind things that we had learned from Giliat

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.310
and then improve upon them.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:43.110
Going to SKE was just Jehovah's way of giving us that encouragement, that hug, telling

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:50.110
us that he loves us and giving us the needed training to keep on going.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.470
Brother Normaie have wondered in 1942 if we'd ever find a thousand students.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.550
But by the tenth class of Giliat, the 1,000th student had graduated.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:07.029
In just the United States branch territory, more than 1,000 students are being trained

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:09.949
in theocratic schools each week.

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:13.629
In our times we see Isaiah 60 verse 22 coming true.

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:18.430
The little one will become a thousand and the small one a mighty nation.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:24.069
Jehovah has blessed the use of theocratic schools to contribute to this amazing growth.

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:29.149
And with such training, he's strengthening his people from the inside out as he prepares

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:31.149
us all for the real life to come.
