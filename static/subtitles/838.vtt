00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.879
We are living in the last of the last days.

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:15.880
That means soon we are going to face events that will test our integrity as never before.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:23.879
Yes, now is the time that we need to be alert and decisive.

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:30.879
Now that's a similar situation to what our brothers found themselves in in the first century.

00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:36.880
Yes, they had some dramatic events that faced them.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.880
What were some of the events that early Christians had to deal with?

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.880
And how did Jesus prepare them to face those events?

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.880
And what does it mean for us today?

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.880
Well, first of all, I'd like you to imagine this scene.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.880
We'll go back in time to nice and 933 CE.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.880
Do you remember what happened on that day?

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.879
Jesus was mounted on a donkey.

00:01:05.879 --> 00:01:09.879
And in your mind, can you visualize, you're with Jesus,

00:01:09.879 --> 00:01:16.879
as he starts to go down the area from the Mount of Olives and the Kidron Valley looking up towards the city of Jerusalem.

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:19.879
What happens? The crowds start together.

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:21.879
More and more people.

00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:24.879
People start throwing the garments on the road.

00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:27.879
Others cut down branches and waved them around.

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:31.879
They call out, blessed is the one who comes in Jehovah's name.

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:34.879
The whole city is an uproar.

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:37.879
How exciting that would have been.

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:42.879
And yet at that exciting moment in his life,

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:47.879
Jesus started sobbing and crying.

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:54.879
Why? Let's turn to the record in Luke chapter 19.

00:01:54.879 --> 00:02:00.879
Luke 19 and verses 41 through 44.

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:05.879
And here the Inspire account tells us that when Jesus got nearby,

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:10.879
He viewed the city and wept over it,

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:16.879
saying, if you, even you had discerned on this day,

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.879
the things having to do with peace.

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:23.879
But now they have been hidden from your eyes.

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:30.879
Because the days will come upon you when your enemies will build around you a fortification of pointed states

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:35.879
and will encircle you and besiege you from every side.

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.879
They will dash you and your children within you to the ground.

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.879
And they will not leave us stone upon a stone in you

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:51.879
because you did not discern the time of your being inspected.

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.879
What do we see from these verses?

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:02.879
Do we see the compassion Jesus had for those who would be killed when Jerusalem was to be destroyed?

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:09.879
Yes, he was envisioning the destruction that would occur in the year 70 CE.

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:16.879
He was moved by the emotions of that, so much so that he cried loudly,

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:24.879
not silently like he did when he was about to resurrect Lazarus, but audibly loudly.

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.879
Now what do we learn from this?

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:33.879
Well for a start we can see Jehovah's love for people as reflected in Jesus.

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:40.879
Jesus was very distraught thinking about what would happen to that city and its inhabitants.

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:47.879
And then in verse 44, what was the other thing that Jesus was distressed about?

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:54.879
That that was a time of judgment we might say or inspection.

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:59.879
Yes, even though Jesus was thinking ahead to future events,

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:06.879
he realized that they were missing the opportunity at that time to do something,

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:11.879
things that they needed to do to prepare for the future.

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.879
There's something else that we learn too.

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.879
Not only do we learn from the compassion that Jesus displayed,

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:24.879
which we should likewise display when we think about what's going to happen to this wicked world,

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:32.879
but also if Jesus had so much emotion and feeling about wicked people who are about to be destroyed,

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:35.879
how do you think he felt about his followers?

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:37.879
Do you think he wanted to prepare them?

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:38.879
Of course.

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:40.879
And that's why we're not surprised.

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:46.879
Two days later, why he took a side, his apostles, and gave them some instructions.

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:53.879
Let's turn it to the record in Luke chapter 21 and verses 20 through 22.

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:57.879
Jesus is recorded as saying,

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:02.879
however, when you see Jerusalem surrounded by encamped armies,

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:06.879
now in this case, he's referring to 66, see,

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:10.879
then know that the desolating of her has drawn near.

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:15.879
Then let those in Judea begin fleeing to the mountains.

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:21.879
Let those in the midst of her, that's in the midst of Jerusalem, leave.

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:28.879
And let those in the countryside not enter into her or enter into Jerusalem,

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:38.160
because these are days for meeting out justice in order that all the things written may be fulfilled.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.160
Did you notice that there were three groups of his followers that he was referring to?

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.160
He spoke about those who lived in Judea.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.160
So that wasn't just Jerusalem, that was the surrounding area.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.160
So they were told, get out of there, flee, go to the mountains.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.160
Then he spoke to those who would be living in Jerusalem, and what did he say?

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.160
Leave the city.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.160
And then the third group, those who would live in the countryside.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:12.160
We know many people were farmers, and they lived in open areas doing agriculture.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.160
Normally, what would be expected is if armies were to come to a certain area,

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.160
these people would flee into the fortified city.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.160
So what Jesus told them to do was the opposite.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:32.160
So no matter where his followers would be, whether in the countryside, in the city,

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.160
or in the general area, what was the common denominator?

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.160
Don't flee to the city.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.160
Don't put your trust in Jerusalem.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:55.160
Yes, Jesus was telling them what they needed to know before the events would occur.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:02.160
Now, what really was the lesson that Jesus was impressing on these ones?

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.160
Well, although those he was speaking to at that time were Jewish,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:14.160
they had to realize that Jerusalem was no longer the earthly seat of Jehovah's Kingdom.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:22.160
They had to also realize that the temple was no longer the center of Jehovah's worship.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.160
So Christians had to get those facts clearly in mind,

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:34.160
make their decisions at that time prior to the events that would come later.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.160
Now, maybe we could illustrate it in a modern sense.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:44.160
Many of us have had to face the issue with regard to blood transfusions.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:49.160
When do you need to make your decision with regard to that?

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.160
Is it when you're in the ambulance, semi-conscious, in pain?

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.160
Is it like, oh, let me the DBA.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.819
Can you read the fine print?

00:08:00.819 --> 00:08:04.819
Or is it when you get into the emergency operating room?

00:08:04.819 --> 00:08:08.819
And you start arguing with people and asking questions?

00:08:08.819 --> 00:08:10.819
No.

00:08:10.819 --> 00:08:16.819
We realize that now is the time that we need to make our decisions.

00:08:16.819 --> 00:08:20.819
Then we need to live by those decisions.

00:08:20.819 --> 00:08:27.819
And then if an emergency should occur, we'll be ready for that situation.

00:08:27.819 --> 00:08:31.819
That was the lesson Jesus was teaching them.

00:08:31.819 --> 00:08:38.820
Yes, the Christians back in the first century had to read themselves of any feelings of nationalistic pride.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.820
Any feelings that Jerusalem was the city.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.820
Otherwise, they would make the wrong decision.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:52.820
This was especially true in the year 66C.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.820
What happened in that year?

00:08:54.820 --> 00:09:00.809
Well, let's consider a brief overview.

00:09:00.809 --> 00:09:05.809
Most of us are familiar with what happened toward the end of 66C.

00:09:05.809 --> 00:09:11.809
At that time, the Roman army under the leadership of Cestius Gallus attacked Jerusalem.

00:09:11.809 --> 00:09:21.720
But unexpectedly, they retreated, allowing time for Christians in the city to flee Jerusalem.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:29.029
Was that the only thing that happened in the year 66C?

00:09:29.029 --> 00:09:31.029
No.

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:36.029
Let's look back in time to see what other events took place.

00:09:36.029 --> 00:09:44.440
This will help us understand why Christians needed to be alert and decisive beforehand.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.440
First, let's think about the background.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:54.440
The Jewish nation was fed up with Roman taxation and corruption way back in Jesus' day.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:10:00.440
But by the beginning of 66C, the situation was even worse.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:09.440
The Roman governor of Judea, Cestius Flores, was totally corrupt and was notorious for his cruelty.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.440
The spirit of rebellion was everywhere.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:18.440
Judea was a powder keg ready to explode.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:27.440
Around the spring of 66C, Flores planted the temple treasury in Jerusalem, stealing some 17 talents.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.440
This caused the revolt among the Jews.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:42.440
In retaliation, Flores ordered his soldiers to attack the rebels and allowed his soldiers to plunder hundreds of homes and to kill some 3600 Jews.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:54.909
However, the Roman assault was repelled and Flores and his men retreated from the city.

00:10:54.909 --> 00:10:59.909
If you were there at that time, how would you have reacted?

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:06.149
Would you have been outraged by Flores' action?

00:11:06.149 --> 00:11:15.149
If you lived in the countryside, would you think the Romans may return and now is the time to flee to Jerusalem?

00:11:15.149 --> 00:11:19.149
Christians needed to be alert and decisive.

00:11:19.149 --> 00:11:26.149
Remember, Jerusalem was not important to Christians. It was not the place of safety.

00:11:26.149 --> 00:11:29.149
What happened next?

00:11:29.149 --> 00:11:35.149
Eleazar, the son of High Priest Ananias, gained control of the temple area.

00:11:35.149 --> 00:11:46.779
He suspended the sacrifices offered to the emperor and then drove the remaining Romans out of the upper part of the city.

00:11:46.779 --> 00:11:50.779
If you were there, would you have been proud?

00:11:50.779 --> 00:11:54.779
Happy that the corrupt Romans were forced to leave?

00:11:54.779 --> 00:12:02.779
Remember though, Jerusalem was not important to Christians. It was not the place of safety.

00:12:02.779 --> 00:12:10.190
Christians needed to be alert and decisive and not distracted.

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:16.190
Then around July, August, Menahem, the leader of another Jewish faction,

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:21.190
overraned the Roman fortress of Masada and seized Roman weapons from there.

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:30.529
He then returned to Jerusalem and captured the Tower of Fortress of Antonia.

00:12:30.529 --> 00:12:40.940
They said, fire to Herod's palace, the palaces of Agrippa and Bernice, as well as High Priest Ananias' home.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:45.940
Then they ordered the murder of High Priest Ananias and his brother Isaachire.

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:54.940
Following that, they returned to the fortress of Antonia and massacred the garrison of Roman soldiers still there.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:13:03.580
The city was divided and in uproar.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:09.580
Do you see how easy it would have been to join sides with one of the factions?

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:15.580
Remember though, these events were not important to Christians.

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:20.580
They needed to be alert and decisive and not distracted.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:31.580
Finally around November, Sestia's gallows, the governor of Syria, marched with his troops and camped about six miles from Jerusalem.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:40.580
Even though it was the Sabbath day, the Jewish rebels streamed out of the city and made a hasty assault on the Romans.

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:46.580
The Romans retreated to Bethhoren and the Jews captured Roman supplies and weapons.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:58.580
Agrippa sent two representatives, his personal friends to the Jewish rebels, to persuade them to lay down their weapons and to promise them diplomacy.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:02.580
But the rebels killed one of the men and wounded the other.

00:14:04.659 --> 00:14:19.740
Sestia's pursued the rebels to Jerusalem, camped at Mount Scopus for three days and then started to undermine the city wall and tried to set fire to the gate of the temple.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:26.740
But then, for some unexpected reason, gallows and his army retreated.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:33.740
Alert Christians in Jerusalem and Judea immediately acted decisively and fled.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:44.740
The rebels chased the Roman army, inflicting considerable losses in both men and supplies and gallows ordered his soldiers to retreat.

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:52.740
After seven days, the Jewish rebels gave up chasing the Romans and pillaged the supplies left behind.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:58.429
They returned to Jerusalem after eight days.

00:14:58.429 --> 00:15:02.429
What was the situation in Jerusalem at that time?

00:15:02.429 --> 00:15:14.429
Josephus says, in the face of the exhilaration which now seized Jerusalem, the spokesmen for peace with Rome were obliged to remain silent.

00:15:14.429 --> 00:15:20.429
Even those opposed the war were swept along by the force of the circumstances.

00:15:20.429 --> 00:15:24.429
Those who supported Rome left.

00:15:24.429 --> 00:15:33.870
All the rest were won over to the side of the rebels, partly by force, partly by persuasion.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:38.870
If you were there, what would you have done?

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:43.870
Many Jews started to flee to Jerusalem seeking refuge there.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:47.870
But was it a safe refuge? No.

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:53.870
There was anarchy in the city, several Jewish political factions fought each other.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:59.870
Eventually in 70 CE, Jerusalem was destroyed along with its temple.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:08.870
But the Christians who were alert and decisive were safe, far away in Pella, on the other side of the Jordan River.

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:15.179
What do we learn from this brief review of the events of 66 CE?

00:16:17.659 --> 00:16:23.659
It wasn't just one event, wasn't, but a series of events.

00:16:23.659 --> 00:16:27.659
Were you amazed at how many events occurred in 66 CE?

00:16:27.659 --> 00:16:32.259
And that was just a brief summary.

00:16:32.259 --> 00:16:39.259
There were many divisive political and religious issues that could have been distracting to Christians.

00:16:39.259 --> 00:16:45.259
So those Christians needed to remain focused on their hope.

00:16:45.259 --> 00:16:52.889
They needed to remember that Jerusalem and its temple gave no security for them.

00:16:52.889 --> 00:16:56.889
Why should we be so interested in all of this today?

00:16:56.889 --> 00:17:04.890
Notice what else Jesus said as recorded at Luke chapter 21 verses 34 through 36.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:16.259
But pay attention to yourselves, that your hearts never become weighed down, with overeating and heavy drinking and anxieties of life.

00:17:16.259 --> 00:17:21.259
And suddenly, that they be instantly upon you as a snare.

00:17:21.259 --> 00:17:27.259
For it will come upon all those dwelling on the face of the whole earth.

00:17:27.259 --> 00:17:36.259
Keep awake then, all the time making supplication, that you may succeed in escaping all these things that must occur,

00:17:36.259 --> 00:17:41.819
and in standing before the Son of Man.

00:17:41.819 --> 00:17:47.819
Jesus said that these things would occur on the face of the whole earth.

00:17:47.819 --> 00:17:52.819
That means he wasn't just talking about Christians in the first century.

00:17:52.819 --> 00:17:56.819
He was talking about us today.

00:17:56.819 --> 00:18:01.819
Yes, we need to pay attention and be alert.

00:18:01.819 --> 00:18:11.859
He also reminded us to make supplication, yes, to strengthen our relationship with Jehovah.

00:18:11.859 --> 00:18:14.859
What does this mean for us today?

00:18:14.859 --> 00:18:18.859
As we face the great tribulation brothers and sisters,

00:18:18.859 --> 00:18:23.859
we don't know exactly all the details of what will happen.

00:18:23.859 --> 00:18:31.859
But we do know that Jesus did not mean that we would have to flee one literal city or go to a certain mountain range.

00:18:31.859 --> 00:18:36.859
How could we? We're scattered over the whole face of the earth.

00:18:36.859 --> 00:18:44.859
But we do need to remember the same things that the first century Christians needed to remember.

00:18:44.859 --> 00:18:51.859
Don't put out trust in the religious and political systems of Satan's world.

00:18:51.859 --> 00:18:53.859
Why is this so vital?

00:18:53.859 --> 00:19:02.859
Just as in 66 CE, today we see one event after another leading up to the final day.

00:19:02.859 --> 00:19:08.859
Everywhere there is evidence of political instability and infighting.

00:19:08.859 --> 00:19:12.859
Not only among nations, but also within nations.

00:19:12.859 --> 00:19:21.859
Religious political and social issues, including abortion and homosexuality, have become divisive topics.

00:19:21.859 --> 00:19:28.859
Scientific issues, such as global warming, have also become political issues.

00:19:28.859 --> 00:19:35.369
Just as in the first century, we must take to heart Jesus' warning.

00:19:35.369 --> 00:19:40.369
Don't take sides in the chaos that's happening all around us.

00:19:40.369 --> 00:19:44.369
Yes, keep your focus on the Kingdom of Hope.

00:19:44.369 --> 00:19:59.059
Remember, soon we will face events that will test our integrity as never before.

00:19:59.059 --> 00:20:02.059
So what are the takeaway points?

00:20:02.059 --> 00:20:09.059
Well, first of all, we realize that now is the time we need to make decisions and stick to those decisions.

00:20:10.059 --> 00:20:17.059
Yes, we need to be absolutely determined not to put our faith and trust in worldly politics.

00:20:17.059 --> 00:20:22.059
We need to remain neutral, always thinking of God's Kingdom.

00:20:22.059 --> 00:20:27.059
We also need to remember that it's not just one event coming up in the future.

00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:30.059
There can be a series of events all happening at the same time.

00:20:30.059 --> 00:20:32.059
They could be distracting.

00:20:32.059 --> 00:20:37.059
But if we have made up our decision now, we'll be ready for that time.

00:20:37.059 --> 00:20:42.059
And also, we remember the need to keep our relationship strong with Jehovah God.

00:20:42.059 --> 00:20:45.059
And we remember the compassion of Jesus.

00:20:45.059 --> 00:20:50.059
So Jehovah and Jesus want us to be protected at that time.

00:20:50.059 --> 00:20:57.059
So may we be determined to continue to be alert and decisive.
