WEBVTT

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:25.730
Welcome to JW Broadcasting for January 2023.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:33.729
On October 1st, 2022, the Watchtower Bible and Track Society of Pennsylvania held its annual meeting.

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:37.729
One of the most exciting events on our Theocratic calendar.

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:42.729
We are delighted to share this special meeting with all of you.

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:47.729
Please enjoy part one of this beautiful program.

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:57.729
It's our pleasure to welcome all of you to the annual meeting of the Watchtower Bible and Track Society of Pennsylvania.

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:06.260
Well, it's been a hard year, very hard for many.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.260
Some are mourning the loss of loved ones.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.260
Others are concerned about the health of family members, or maybe their own health.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:27.670
Still others have lost everything they own in a fire, a flood, or hurricane.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:35.670
And when you lose your home in a natural disaster, usually you lose your job too.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.670
If your home has been affected, your place of work is affected.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:47.670
And so many of these folks won't have any way to get their home back because they have no job.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.670
So it's been a tough year.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.670
But all of us need encouragement.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:11.669
And so it's our prayer that by the end of this program, you're going to feel encouraged, spiritually built up, and absolutely convinced that no matter what has happened or what is going to happen, Jehovah is going to help you through.

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:13.669
He's going to take care of you.

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:21.669
Now the program is going to feature a number of videos interspersed with talks from various members of the governing body.

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:26.669
I don't know what they're going to talk about, but they certainly have chosen some interesting themes.

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:30.669
I'm going to be on the edge of my seat to see what they have to tell us.

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:38.669
But first up is a video of one of our favorite subjects, Caleb and Sophia.

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:45.669
Now just so you know, Caleb is not a member of the governing body, but he's going to be on the program anyway.

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:48.669
Now this is the longer version. They call it the epic version.

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:52.669
It's part of the series, become Jehovah's friend.

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:56.669
And the title is, who should be my friend?

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:57.669
Let's watch.

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:07.960
You've got this phone.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.960
Go, go, go.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.960
Yes.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.960
Bro, that was good.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:53.169
His friends.

00:03:53.169 --> 00:04:01.830
When we see throughout the gospel accounts, the those who chose to be a friend to Jesus, gain the best friend possible.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:12.919
Oh, you like to draw?

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.919
I like your notes.

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:16.920
Really cool.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.920
Mom taught me.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.920
Thanks for telling me to remember.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.920
Me too.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.920
So, looks like we have a talk together.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.920
Yeah.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.920
I'll get in touch to practice soon.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.920
Lydia, we're leaving.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.920
Well, I got to go. See you later, Sophia.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.939
Hey, bro.

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:44.769
Hey, good to see you.

00:04:44.769 --> 00:04:47.769
I'm glad I was on your team.

00:04:47.769 --> 00:04:50.769
My favorite thing was the Safari Treehouse.

00:04:50.769 --> 00:04:53.769
Yeah, it had all the cool jungle animals on the wall.

00:04:53.769 --> 00:04:57.769
To me, I didn't think your team was going to make it.

00:04:57.769 --> 00:05:01.769
I love my prize.

00:05:01.769 --> 00:05:03.769
You got a prize?

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:08.079
We all did.

00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:27.379
Okay, kids, settle down.

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:29.379
Time to get started.

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:31.379
We have a lot to talk about today.

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:42.720
Before we begin, for those of you that participated in the Science Club this weekend,

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.720
we will be having another camping trip.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.720
But only the ones with the highest score on the math project will be selected to go.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.720
More on that after class.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.720
Sophia, we need you in our club.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.720
You're good at science.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:19.470
We have another trip coming up.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.470
All the kids had badges and prizes and stuff.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:27.470
And it sounded like a lot of fun.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.470
And it seems like they really need my help.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:35.540
Hmm, I see.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.540
Oh, you see what's wrong with the car?

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.540
No, I wish.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.540
No, I see why you wanted to be in the club.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.540
You do?

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:45.540
Of course.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.540
We all want to have friends and do fun things.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.540
Please, would you mind moving the light over here?

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.540
Uh, right there.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:59.439
Thank you.

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:04.009
I just wish I had some kid friends.

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:05.009
Hmm.

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:08.009
Jehovah wants you and me to have friends.

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:11.009
But the question you need to ask yourself is,

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:13.009
who should be my friend?

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:18.569
Let's talk about it at our next family worship.

00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:21.569
How about you go do some research on Martha?

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:26.060
And I will talk Caleb too.

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:31.860
And then we can come back together and talk about it as a family.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:37.339
Sophia, are you ready?

00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:38.339
Yeah.

00:07:38.339 --> 00:07:46.230
Martha, a Jewish, a sister of Lazarus, and Mary.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:50.800
They lived in Bethany.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.800
A village about two miles away from Jerusalem.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.800
Which was probably Jesus' home base when he came down from Galilee.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.800
I feel like to cook.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.800
Yes, she did.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.800
And she would cook for Jesus and all his disciples when they would visit.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:15.329
That would have been a lot of food.

00:08:15.329 --> 00:08:16.329
Yes.

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:19.329
And a lot of work.

00:08:19.329 --> 00:08:22.329
But if they work together, they make it a success.

00:08:23.329 --> 00:08:27.329
However, some of their friends felt differently about Jesus.

00:08:27.329 --> 00:08:38.970
Martha makes the best apricot cakes.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.970
It's just a fact.

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.970
You've always praised me too much, Talia.

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:47.970
Well, if it gets me more apricot cakes, I will continue to praise you.

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:54.590
Oh, Talia, did you hear the teacher Jesus?

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.590
He's coming back to visit.

00:08:56.590 --> 00:09:02.590
The man from Galilee, are you hosting him again?

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:05.590
Yes, I am.

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:07.590
Actually, it's tonight.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.590
I've heard a lot of talk.

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:14.590
The Pharisees in Jerusalem, they don't approve of that man.

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:18.590
I am not sure it's such a good idea for you to be known as his friend.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:25.919
Okay, well, I guess I better be getting home.

00:09:25.919 --> 00:09:26.919
See you too later.

00:09:26.919 --> 00:09:51.840
Martha, Jesus is here.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:10:46.149
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:10:46.149 --> 00:10:48.149
Let me get this straight.

00:10:48.149 --> 00:10:53.149
He wanted you and Mary to sit and learn about God just like the men.

00:10:53.149 --> 00:11:00.149
The teacher instructing women a woman's job is to provide food for her household.

00:11:00.149 --> 00:11:01.149
That's true.

00:11:01.149 --> 00:11:05.149
A good woman prepares herself for hard work.

00:11:05.149 --> 00:11:06.149
That's valuable.

00:11:06.149 --> 00:11:09.149
That's you, Martha.

00:11:09.149 --> 00:11:12.149
Don't let this Jesus ruin you with his ideas.

00:11:12.149 --> 00:11:38.480
Lazarus, I know you.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.480
How is he doing?

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.480
Not well.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.480
I sent word to Jesus.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.480
He will help my brother.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.480
You sent word to Jesus?

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.480
Have you still not heard?

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.480
He's angering people with his shocking speech.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.480
He's claiming to be God's son.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.480
He's crazy.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:10.799
He's loyal to Jehovah, and he is our friend.

00:12:10.799 --> 00:12:12.799
Sadly, Lazarus died.

00:12:12.799 --> 00:12:20.480
But do you remember what happened next?

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:25.480
Jesus came back to Bethany and was erected Lazarus.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.480
Jesus was a real friend.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.480
He cared about Martha, Mary, and Lazarus.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:36.480
And he showed them what kind of friend Jehovah can be to us.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.480
But that's not where this story ends.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.480
Do you know what some people did after that?

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.480
Many of the Jews who saw what he did put faith in him.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.480
But some of them went off to the Pharisees

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.480
and told them what Jesus had done.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.480
Why did they do that?

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:58.480
Because not even seeing Jesus bring someone back to life

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:04.500
was enough to convince them that he was the Christ.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:09.500
They seemed like Martha's friends, but they hated Jesus.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:14.320
How do you think Martha dealt with her unbelieving friends?

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:21.899
Jesus is the Christ, the resurrection, and the life.

00:13:21.899 --> 00:13:24.899
He is the son of God.

00:13:24.899 --> 00:13:27.899
And he is my friend, Talia.

00:13:27.899 --> 00:13:34.100
You've been kind to me in the past.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.100
But you don't believe Jesus' teachings.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.100
We cannot be friends.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:53.220
Martha stuck with Jesus and his friends.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:56.220
They helped her become Jehovah's friend.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:13.299
So Sophia, what do you think Jehovah's teaching you?

00:14:13.299 --> 00:14:16.299
About friendship.

00:14:16.299 --> 00:14:20.299
That I have to choose my friends carefully.

00:14:20.299 --> 00:14:23.299
And how can you know if someone should be your friend?

00:14:23.299 --> 00:14:27.710
If they help me be Jehovah's friend,

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:32.659
I'm not going to join the club.

00:14:32.659 --> 00:14:34.659
That's my girl.

00:14:34.659 --> 00:14:37.659
We are so proud of you, Sophia.

00:14:37.659 --> 00:14:40.659
And Jehovah is proud of you, too.

00:14:40.659 --> 00:14:43.659
Now, how about you go finish up your homework?

00:14:43.659 --> 00:14:46.659
Mom tells me we have a guest coming over.

00:14:46.659 --> 00:14:56.789
Okay.

00:14:56.789 --> 00:14:59.789
Jehovah, please help me find a good friend.

00:14:59.789 --> 00:15:01.789
Someone who loves you.

00:15:01.789 --> 00:15:09.460
At least you are my friend.

00:15:15.179 --> 00:15:21.419
I talk.

00:15:21.419 --> 00:15:26.139
Do you like turtles?

00:15:26.139 --> 00:15:28.139
I love turtles.

00:15:28.139 --> 00:15:40.539
I've got something I want to show you.

00:15:40.539 --> 00:15:47.669
It is so cute.

00:15:47.669 --> 00:15:50.669
You know, Sophia, I think we're going to be friends.

00:15:50.669 --> 00:16:07.080
Yep, definitely friends.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.080
Admit it.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.080
You enjoy watching Caleb and Sophia

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.080
just as much as the kids do.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:18.080
And we know because we get ladders from adults.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.080
Now we're going to enjoy the first of the talks

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.080
by members of the governing body.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.080
And this one will be delivered by Brother Garrett Lurch.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:28.080
He has a very interesting theme,

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.080
supported by the pillar of truth.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.080
Brother Lurch, please.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:40.000
Is the following statement true or false?

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Truth is relative.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
That statement is not relatively but absolutely false.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Something is truth for one person

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
but not truth for another person.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Many religious organizations claim to have the truth.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:04.000
However, between them there are many contradicting teachings.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Is this just another evidence that

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
all truth is relative?

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
That there is no absolute truth?

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000
No.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
The truth is that truth is not relative.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
It is absolute.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Those who say truth is relative

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
are not only relatively but absolutely wrong.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
The Hebrew word for truth,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Amit, is often rendered truth

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.000
and may designate what is firm, trustworthy, stable or faithful.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
The Greek word for truth,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Alatia, originates with the word meaning not concealed.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:53.000
So the truth often involves the revealing of that which was formally hidden.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Jesus said according to Luke 12 verse 2,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
But there is nothing carefully concealed that will not be revealed

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000
and nothing secret that will not become known.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
There are over 70 places in the Gospel accounts

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
where Jesus is said to have used the unique expression

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
to emphasize the truthfulness of his words.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000
He would often say amen to introduce a sentence.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
The corresponding Hebrew word meant certain truth.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Lost the new international dictionary of New Testament theology,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
quote,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
By introducing his words with amen,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Jesus labeled them as certain and reliable.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:50.000
He stood by them and made them binding on himself and his hearers.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
The new international dictionary of New Testament theology,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Volume 3, page 901 says,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000
quote,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Many people try to unmask everything in the belief that no one and nothing can genuinely lay claim to truth.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Truth can indeed be found.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.000
We need to display a humble submission to truth whenever and wherever it emerges.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Such openness to truth is required of those who worship the God of truth.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Reference for truth ensures honesty in a man's dealings with his neighbor,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
both in word and deed.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:42.000
This is the attitude to which both the Old Testament and the New Testament bear witness.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
End of quote.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Does the truth ever change?

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:55.000
That question was raised by the R. Ruggiero in his book The Art of Thinking.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
His answer is no, to quote him.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:08.000
It may sometimes seem to that it changes, but on closer inspection it will be found not to.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Yes, the truth never changes.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Consider, he says, the case of the authorship of the first book of the Bible, The Book of Genesis.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:26.000
For centuries, Christians and Jews alike believed that the book had a single author.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:37.000
In time, this view was challenged and eventually replaced by the belief that as many as five authors contributed to Genesis.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Then, in 1981, the results of a five-year linguistic analysis of Genesis were published,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:54.000
stating that there is an 82% probability of single authorship as originally thought.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.279
Has the truth about the authorship of Genesis changed?

00:20:59.279 --> 00:21:06.279
No, only our belief has changed. End of quote.

00:21:06.279 --> 00:21:13.279
He also wrote, the truth will not be changed by our knowledge or by our ignorance.

00:21:13.279 --> 00:21:15.279
And we agree.

00:21:15.279 --> 00:21:26.279
In fact, no one really believes that there is no truth when it comes to physical realities such as medicine, mathematics, or the laws of physics.

00:21:26.279 --> 00:21:30.279
All people believe that some things are true.

00:21:31.279 --> 00:21:39.279
Who of us would dare to write in an airplane if we didn't believe that the laws of aerodynamics were absolute truth?

00:21:39.279 --> 00:21:48.170
Very viable truth to exist. They surround us and we stake our lives on them.

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:51.170
Does the truth ever change?

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:53.170
It does not.

00:21:53.170 --> 00:22:04.170
Our understanding of truth changes as we progress in understanding it, but the truth never changes.

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:08.170
When Jesus said that our purpose in life was to talk about the truth,

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:14.170
He was speaking of something that faithful Jews had valued for centuries.

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:23.170
In their sacred writings, the Jews had long read of truth as something concrete, not theoretical.

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:36.170
In the Bible, truth translates the Hebrew word emith, which signifies that which is firm, solid, and perhaps most of all reliable.

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:38.170
End of quote.

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:47.170
The Jews had good reason for viewing truth in that way. They called their God, Jehovah, the God of truth.

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:52.170
This was because everything Jehovah said he would do, he did.

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:59.170
When he made promises, he kept them. When he inspired prophecies, they were fulfilled.

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:04.170
When he uttered final judgments, they were carried out.

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:09.170
Millions of Israelites had been eyewitnesses of these realities.

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:15.170
The inspired writers of the Bible recorded them as indisputable facts of history.

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:23.170
Unlike other books viewed as sacred, the Bible is not set against a backdrop of myth or legend.

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:32.170
It is firmly grounded in verifiable facts, historical, archaeological, and scientific.

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:37.170
And sociological also realities.

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:43.170
No wonder the Psalmist says to Jehovah, you are law is truth.

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:51.579
All your commandments are truth. The very essence of your word is truth.

00:23:51.579 --> 00:23:56.579
Since Jehovah God is the author of the Bible, the Bible is truth.

00:23:57.579 --> 00:24:06.579
Jesus Christ echoed the words of that Psalm when he said in prayer to Jehovah, you are word is truth.

00:24:06.579 --> 00:24:13.579
Jesus knew that everything his father spoke was absolutely firm and reliable.

00:24:13.579 --> 00:24:18.579
Likewise, Jesus himself was full of truth.

00:24:18.579 --> 00:24:23.579
Yes, Jesus was even the personification of truth.

00:24:23.579 --> 00:24:29.579
The Mosaic Law was truth. But it was not the full truth.

00:24:29.579 --> 00:24:34.579
Jesus taught something different from the Mosaic Law.

00:24:34.579 --> 00:24:44.579
The Bible shows that the Mosaic Law was a shadow or prophetic picture of greater realities which came through Christ.

00:24:44.579 --> 00:24:51.579
And so the Mosaic Law was not the full truth but a pattern of it.

00:24:51.579 --> 00:24:55.579
Jesus was not the shadow but the reality.

00:24:55.579 --> 00:25:02.859
He said in John 146, I am the truth.

00:25:02.859 --> 00:25:06.859
But as far as teachings are concerned, what is truth?

00:25:06.859 --> 00:25:09.859
What helps us to understand it?

00:25:09.859 --> 00:25:13.859
The Bible speaks of the spirit of the truth.

00:25:13.859 --> 00:25:16.859
What is the spirit of the truth?

00:25:16.859 --> 00:25:22.859
It is the spirit that proceeds from Jehovah God. It is pure and holy.

00:25:22.859 --> 00:25:29.859
Jesus told His disciples at John 16, 12 and 13.

00:25:29.859 --> 00:25:34.859
I still have many things to say to you but you are not able to bear them now.

00:25:34.859 --> 00:25:38.859
However, when that one comes, the spirit of the truth,

00:25:38.859 --> 00:25:41.859
He will guide you into all the truth,

00:25:41.859 --> 00:25:44.859
for He will not speak of His own initiative,

00:25:44.859 --> 00:25:47.859
but what He hears, He will speak.

00:25:47.859 --> 00:25:51.859
And He will declare to you the things to come.

00:25:51.859 --> 00:25:57.859
God's Spirit would teach them everything they needed to know to carry out their work,

00:25:57.859 --> 00:26:04.859
recalling and opening up their understanding, things that previously they heard from Jesus

00:26:04.859 --> 00:26:07.859
but had not understood.

00:26:07.859 --> 00:26:12.859
God's Spirit would also declare to them the things coming,

00:26:12.859 --> 00:26:17.859
including the bringing to light the significance of Jesus' death and resurrection,

00:26:17.859 --> 00:26:22.859
as these events were then yet future and were among the things

00:26:22.859 --> 00:26:26.859
that His disciples did not understand in the beginning.

00:26:26.859 --> 00:26:32.859
Brother Charles Teiz Russell wrote the book, The Divine Plan of the Ages.

00:26:32.859 --> 00:26:36.859
It was published in 1886.

00:26:36.859 --> 00:26:41.859
It included a discussion on the Bible as a divine revelation,

00:26:41.859 --> 00:26:45.859
viewed in the light of reason.

00:26:45.859 --> 00:26:51.859
It said, the depth and power and wisdom and scope of the Bible's testimony

00:26:51.859 --> 00:26:56.859
convince us that not man but Almighty God is the author

00:26:56.859 --> 00:27:04.940
to appreciate the truth more to what can we compare the truth.

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:09.940
Truth is like a mirror that helps us to see the facts

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:13.940
and if necessary to improve our looks.

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:18.940
Truth is like a pillar, firm and supportive,

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:22.940
and it helps to combat false teachings.

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:28.940
Truth is also compared to a girdle or a belt that warriors used.

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:32.940
It helps us to continue with right conduct.

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:36.940
Truth is like a rainbow for beauty.

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:41.940
Truth is as beautiful as the song of the Nightingale.

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:47.940
Truth is like a romantic bonfire for warmth on the cold evening.

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:52.940
Here's an illustration that many of you will like.

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:57.940
Truth is like the first cup of coffee in the morning, invigorating somebody.

00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:01.940
Yes, truth is invigorating.

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:07.940
Truth is like a magnet drawing honest-hearted ones to God.

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:10.940
Truth is like an oasis in the desert.

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:15.940
Truth is like an anchor in the stormy seas.

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:19.940
Truth is like a lifeboat on a sinking ship.

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:26.940
Truth is like a lighthouse in the night guiding a boat safely to the shore or harbor.

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:30.940
Truth is like a compass showing sailors the way.

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:37.940
But it is also like a compass showing the way out of a jungle to a safe area.

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:43.940
Truth is like the rising sun bathing landscape in warm light.

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:48.940
Truth is like the display of fireworks for beauty.

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:58.859
Truth is like the magnetic shield around the earth protecting it from deathly cosmic radiation.

00:28:58.859 --> 00:29:00.859
Truth is like light.

00:29:00.859 --> 00:29:04.859
The fruit of light consists in every sort of truth.

00:29:04.859 --> 00:29:10.859
He that does what is true comes to the light, the Bible says.

00:29:10.859 --> 00:29:15.859
Imagine you were born blind and received eyesight through an operation.

00:29:15.859 --> 00:29:18.859
Wouldn't you be elated?

00:29:18.859 --> 00:29:24.859
Truth is like that when somebody comes to know and appreciate it.

00:29:24.859 --> 00:29:30.859
Truth is like a beautiful music played solo or by an orchestra.

00:29:30.859 --> 00:29:36.859
Truth is like the most delicious food for taste and gives strength.

00:29:36.859 --> 00:29:40.859
Truth is what a nursing mother is to her baby.

00:29:40.859 --> 00:29:43.859
Truth is like a hidden treasure.

00:29:43.859 --> 00:29:46.859
We need to dig for it.

00:29:46.859 --> 00:29:50.859
Truth is like refreshing water on a hot day.

00:29:50.859 --> 00:29:53.859
Truth is like a mighty river.

00:29:53.859 --> 00:29:58.859
If you try to stop it with a dam, it will overflow the dam.

00:29:58.859 --> 00:30:01.859
Nobody can stop the truth.

00:30:01.859 --> 00:30:02.859
Why?

00:30:02.859 --> 00:30:07.859
Because Jehovah the Almighty is backing it up.

00:30:07.859 --> 00:30:12.859
Truth is like a flower or even a bouquet of beautiful little flowers.

00:30:12.859 --> 00:30:15.859
Brother Russell once wrote, quote,

00:30:15.859 --> 00:30:20.859
Truth, like a modest little flower in the wilderness of life,

00:30:20.859 --> 00:30:26.859
is surrounded and almost joked by the luxurious growth of the weeds of error.

00:30:26.859 --> 00:30:30.859
If you would find it, you must be ever on the lookout.

00:30:30.859 --> 00:30:37.859
If you would see its beauty, you must brush aside the weeds of error and the brambles of bigotry.

00:30:37.859 --> 00:30:42.859
If you would possess it, you must stoop to get it.

00:30:42.859 --> 00:30:49.859
But not content with one flower of truth had one being sufficient.

00:30:49.859 --> 00:30:52.859
There would have been no more.

00:30:52.859 --> 00:30:55.859
Gather ever sick for more.

00:30:55.859 --> 00:30:59.859
Truth is like a fragrance or perfume.

00:30:59.859 --> 00:31:02.859
Truth is like a sparkling diamond.

00:31:02.859 --> 00:31:04.859
Do you love diamonds?

00:31:04.859 --> 00:31:13.859
But the truth value is so much more than diamonds because it brings Jehovah's friendship and leads to everlasting life.

00:31:13.859 --> 00:31:19.390
Truth is compared to a way on which we walk.

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:24.390
Second Peter 2 speaks of the way of the truth.

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:32.390
God is a spirit and those who worship Him must do so with spirit and truth.

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:39.390
Now is the time to study the truth and attend Christian meetings where the truth is taught.

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:42.390
Do not miss congregation meetings.

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:49.390
First Timothy 315 compares the congregation with a pillar of truth.

00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:54.390
The congregation preserves the purity of the truth and upholds it.

00:31:54.390 --> 00:32:00.390
Truth Jehovah teaches us through the Bible but also through Christian meetings.

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:03.390
We are also to speak the truth by preaching.

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:07.390
We speak the truth also with one another.

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:09.390
We have the truth on our lips.

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:12.390
We have the truth around our hips.

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:15.390
Ephesians 614 says,

00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:20.390
We have the belt of truth fastened around our waist.

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:26.390
The truth is in utter, the world is in utter confusion.

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:29.390
What a blessing it is to know the truth.

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:31.390
We rejoice in it.

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:36.390
We are ready to preach the truth and teach the truth.

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:40.390
Yes, we talk the truth and we walk in the truth.

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:44.390
In 3 John 3 we read,

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:47.390
Go on walking in the truth.

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:51.390
Those who walk in the truth now will walk forever.

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:54.390
Micah 4.5 says,

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:59.390
For all the peoples will walk each one in the name of its God.

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:04.390
But we will walk in the name of Jehovah our God forever and ever.

00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:09.390
And that is a long time.

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:14.670
Help your students to love the truth and to lift the truth.

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:20.670
But if necessary to be willing to die for the truth and for Jehovah.

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:24.670
The truth is invincible and we will conquer this wicked world.

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:28.670
Maybe all including our relatives and your Bible students

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:34.670
have the determination to walk in the truth and talk about the truth.

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:36.670
Why shall we do this?

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:41.670
Because we love the truth and we love the God of truth.

00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:46.670
We are also to lift the truth by our Christian conduct.

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:49.670
Brothers, this is the truth.

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:51.670
His word is truth.

00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:55.670
Keep talking the truth and keep walking in the truth.

00:33:55.670 --> 00:34:05.470
Then you will walk forever and praise our loving God of truth.

00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:09.469
Thank you for that absorbing presentation, Garrett.

00:34:09.469 --> 00:34:11.469
We really appreciated it.

00:34:11.469 --> 00:34:17.469
At this time, let's listen as brother Jeffrey Jackson speaks to us on the theme,

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:20.469
Be alert, be decisive.

00:34:20.469 --> 00:34:27.679
We are living in the last of the last days.

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:37.679
That means soon we are going to face events that will test our integrity as never before.

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:45.679
Yes, now is the time that we need to be alert and decisive.

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:52.679
Now that's a similar situation to what our brothers found themselves in in the first century.

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:58.679
Yes, they had some traumatic events that faced them.

00:34:58.679 --> 00:35:04.679
What were some of the events that early Christians had to deal with?

00:35:04.679 --> 00:35:09.679
And how did Jesus prepare them to face those events?

00:35:09.679 --> 00:35:12.679
And what does it mean for us today?

00:35:12.679 --> 00:35:17.679
Well, first of all, I'd like you to imagine this scene.

00:35:17.679 --> 00:35:22.679
We'll go back in time to nice and 933 CE.

00:35:22.679 --> 00:35:24.679
Do you remember what happened on that day?

00:35:24.679 --> 00:35:27.679
Jesus was mounted on a donkey.

00:35:27.679 --> 00:35:31.679
And in your mind, can you visualize, you're with Jesus,

00:35:31.679 --> 00:35:36.679
as he starts to go down the area from the Mount of Olives and the Kidron Valley,

00:35:36.679 --> 00:35:39.679
looking up towards the city of Jerusalem, what happens?

00:35:39.679 --> 00:35:41.679
The crowds start together.

00:35:41.679 --> 00:35:43.679
More and more people.

00:35:43.679 --> 00:35:46.679
People start throwing the garments on the road.

00:35:46.679 --> 00:35:49.679
Others cut down branches and wave them around.

00:35:49.679 --> 00:35:53.679
They call out, blessed is the one who comes in Jehovah's name.

00:35:53.679 --> 00:35:56.679
The whole city is an uproar.

00:35:56.679 --> 00:35:59.679
How exciting that would have been.

00:35:59.679 --> 00:36:04.679
And yet, at that exciting moment in his life,

00:36:04.679 --> 00:36:09.679
Jesus started sobbing and crying.

00:36:09.679 --> 00:36:11.679
Why?

00:36:11.679 --> 00:36:16.679
Let's turn to the record in Luke chapter 19.

00:36:16.679 --> 00:36:22.679
Luke 19 and verses 41 through 44.

00:36:22.679 --> 00:36:27.679
And here the inspired account tells us that when Jesus got nearby,

00:36:27.679 --> 00:36:34.679
He viewed the city and wept over it, saying,

00:36:34.679 --> 00:36:38.679
if you, even you had discerned on this day,

00:36:38.679 --> 00:36:41.679
the things having to do with peace.

00:36:41.679 --> 00:36:45.679
But now they have been hidden from your eyes.

00:36:45.679 --> 00:36:49.679
Because the days will come upon you when your enemies will build around

00:36:49.679 --> 00:36:52.679
you a fortification of pointed states,

00:36:52.679 --> 00:36:57.679
and will encircle you and besiege you from every side.

00:36:57.679 --> 00:37:02.679
They will dash you and your children within you to the ground.

00:37:02.679 --> 00:37:06.679
And they will not leave us stone upon us stone in you,

00:37:06.679 --> 00:37:12.679
because you did not discern the time of your being inspected.

00:37:12.679 --> 00:37:16.679
What do we see from these verses?

00:37:16.679 --> 00:37:21.679
Do we see the compassion Jesus had for those who would be killed

00:37:21.679 --> 00:37:24.679
when Jerusalem was to be destroyed?

00:37:24.679 --> 00:37:31.679
Yes, he was envisioning the destruction that would occur in the year 70 CE.

00:37:31.679 --> 00:37:34.679
He was moved by the emotions of that,

00:37:34.679 --> 00:37:38.679
so much so that he cried loudly,

00:37:38.679 --> 00:37:43.679
not silently like he did when he was about to resurrect Lazarus,

00:37:43.679 --> 00:37:46.679
but audibly, loudly.

00:37:46.679 --> 00:37:49.679
Now, what do we learn from this?

00:37:49.679 --> 00:37:55.679
Well, for a start we can see Jehovah's love for people as reflected in Jesus.

00:37:55.679 --> 00:37:58.679
Jesus was very distraught,

00:37:58.679 --> 00:38:02.679
thinking about what would happen to that city and its inhabitants.

00:38:02.679 --> 00:38:04.679
And then in verse 44,

00:38:04.679 --> 00:38:09.679
what was the other thing that Jesus was distressed about?

00:38:09.679 --> 00:38:16.679
That that was a time of judgment we might say or inspection.

00:38:16.679 --> 00:38:21.679
Yes, even though Jesus was thinking ahead to the future events,

00:38:21.679 --> 00:38:27.679
he realized that they were missing the opportunity at that time to do something,

00:38:27.679 --> 00:38:32.679
things that they needed to do to prepare for the future.

00:38:32.679 --> 00:38:35.679
There's something else that we learn too.

00:38:35.679 --> 00:38:39.679
Not only do we learn from the compassion that Jesus displayed,

00:38:39.679 --> 00:38:45.679
which we should likewise display when we think about what's going to happen to this wicked world,

00:38:45.679 --> 00:38:53.679
but also if Jesus had so much emotion and feeling about wicked people who are about to be destroyed,

00:38:53.679 --> 00:38:57.679
how do you think he felt about his followers?

00:38:57.679 --> 00:39:00.679
Do you think he wanted to prepare them? Of course.

00:39:00.679 --> 00:39:02.679
And that's why we're not surprised.

00:39:02.679 --> 00:39:06.679
Two days later, why he took a side, his apostles,

00:39:06.679 --> 00:39:08.679
and gave them some instructions.

00:39:08.679 --> 00:39:16.679
Let's turn it to the record in Luke chapter 21 and verses 20 through 22.

00:39:16.679 --> 00:39:19.679
Jesus is recorded as saying,

00:39:19.679 --> 00:39:23.679
however, when you see Jerusalem surrounded by encamped armies,

00:39:23.679 --> 00:39:27.679
now in this case, he's referring to 66 CE,

00:39:27.679 --> 00:39:31.679
then know that the desolating of her has drawn near.

00:39:32.679 --> 00:39:37.679
Then let those in Judea begin fleeing to the mountains.

00:39:37.679 --> 00:39:43.679
Let those in the midst of her, that's in the midst of Jerusalem, leave.

00:39:43.679 --> 00:39:50.679
And let those in the countryside not enter into her or enter into Jerusalem,

00:39:50.679 --> 00:39:58.679
because these are days for meeting out justice in order that all the things written may be fulfilled.

00:39:58.679 --> 00:40:04.989
Did you notice that there were three groups of his followers that he was referring to?

00:40:04.989 --> 00:40:07.989
He spoke about those who lived in Judea,

00:40:07.989 --> 00:40:10.989
so that wasn't just Jerusalem, that was the surrounding area,

00:40:10.989 --> 00:40:15.989
so they were told, get out of there, flee, go to the mountains.

00:40:15.989 --> 00:40:20.989
Then he spoke to those who would be living in Jerusalem, and what did he say?

00:40:20.989 --> 00:40:22.989
Leave the city.

00:40:22.989 --> 00:40:26.989
And then the third group, those who would live in the countryside,

00:40:26.989 --> 00:40:33.989
we know many people were farmers, and they lived in open areas doing agriculture.

00:40:33.989 --> 00:40:39.989
Normally what would be expected is if armies would come to a certain area,

00:40:39.989 --> 00:40:43.989
these people would flee into the fortified city.

00:40:43.989 --> 00:40:48.989
So what Jesus told them to do was the opposite.

00:40:48.989 --> 00:40:51.989
So no matter where his followers would be,

00:40:51.989 --> 00:40:55.989
whether in the countryside, in the city, or in the general area,

00:40:55.989 --> 00:40:59.989
what was the common denominator?

00:40:59.989 --> 00:41:02.989
Don't flee to the city.

00:41:02.989 --> 00:41:07.989
Don't put your trust in Jerusalem.

00:41:07.989 --> 00:41:15.989
Yes, Jesus was telling them what they needed to know before the events would occur.

00:41:15.989 --> 00:41:23.989
Now, what really was the lesson that Jesus was impressing on these ones?

00:41:23.989 --> 00:41:28.989
Well, although those he was speaking to at that time were Jewish,

00:41:28.989 --> 00:41:35.989
they had to realize that Jerusalem was no longer the earthly seed of Jehovah's Kingdom.

00:41:35.989 --> 00:41:43.989
They had to also realize that the temple was no longer the center of Jehovah's worship.

00:41:43.989 --> 00:41:48.989
So Christians had to get those facts clearly in mind,

00:41:48.989 --> 00:41:55.989
make their decisions at that time prior to the events that would come later.

00:41:55.989 --> 00:41:59.989
Now, maybe we could illustrate it in a modern sense.

00:41:59.989 --> 00:42:05.989
Many of us have had to face the issue with regard to blood transfusions.

00:42:05.989 --> 00:42:10.989
When do you need to make your decision with regard to that?

00:42:10.989 --> 00:42:14.989
Is it when you're in the ambulance, semi-conscious, in pain?

00:42:14.989 --> 00:42:17.989
Is it like, oh, lend me the DPA.

00:42:17.989 --> 00:42:22.750
Can you read the fine print?

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:26.750
Or is it when you get into the emergency operating room?

00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:30.750
And you start arguing with people and asking questions?

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:32.750
No.

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:38.750
We realize that now is the time that we need to make our decisions.

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:42.750
Then we need to live by those decisions.

00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:49.750
And then if an emergency should occur, we'll be ready for that situation.

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:53.750
That was the lesson Jesus was teaching them.

00:42:53.750 --> 00:43:00.750
Yes, the Christians back in the first century had to read themselves of any feelings of nationalist pride.

00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:04.750
Any feelings that Jerusalem was the city.

00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:07.750
Otherwise, they would make the wrong decision.

00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:14.750
This was especially true in the year 66 CE.

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:16.750
What happened in that year?

00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:19.750
Well, let's consider a brief overview.

00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:26.739
Most of us are familiar with what happened toward the end of 66 CE.

00:43:26.739 --> 00:43:33.739
At that time, the Roman army under the leadership of Sestius Gallus attacked Jerusalem.

00:43:33.739 --> 00:43:38.110
But unexpectedly, they retreated.

00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:43.650
Allowing time for Christians in the city to flee Jerusalem.

00:43:43.650 --> 00:43:50.929
Was that the only thing that happened in the year 66 CE?

00:43:50.929 --> 00:43:52.929
No.

00:43:52.929 --> 00:43:56.929
Let's look back in time to see what other events took place.

00:43:56.929 --> 00:44:03.929
This will help us understand why Christians needed to be alert and decisive beforehand.

00:44:03.929 --> 00:44:08.300
First, let's think about the background.

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:15.300
The Jewish nation was fed up with Roman taxation and corruption way back in Jesus' day.

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:22.300
But by the beginning of 66 CE, the situation was even worse.

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:31.300
The Roman governor of Judea, Jesseus Flores, was totally corrupt and was notorious for his cruelty.

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:34.300
The spirit of rebellion was everywhere.

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:39.300
Judea was a powder keg ready to explode.

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:49.300
Around the spring of 66 CE, Flores planted the temple treasury in Jerusalem stealing some 17 talents.

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:52.300
This caused the revolt among the Jews.

00:44:52.300 --> 00:45:03.300
In retaliation, Flores ordered his soldiers to attack the rebels and allowed his soldiers to plunder hundreds of homes and to kill some 3,600 Jews.

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:11.710
However, the Roman assault was repelled and Flores and his men retreated from the city.

00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:20.869
If you were there at that time, how would you have reacted?

00:45:20.869 --> 00:45:25.150
Would you have been outraged by Flores' action?

00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:36.389
If you lived in the countryside, would you think the Romans may return and now is the time to flee to Jerusalem?

00:45:36.389 --> 00:45:40.389
Christians needed to be alert and decisive.

00:45:41.389 --> 00:45:45.389
Remember, Jerusalem was not important to Christians.

00:45:45.389 --> 00:45:49.389
It was not the place of safety.

00:45:49.389 --> 00:45:51.389
What happened next?

00:45:51.389 --> 00:45:57.389
Eleazar, the son of High Priest Ananias, gained control of the temple area.

00:45:57.389 --> 00:46:06.389
He suspended the sacrifices offered to the emperor and then drove the remaining Romans out of the upper part of the city.

00:46:08.989 --> 00:46:12.989
If you were there, would you have been proud?

00:46:12.989 --> 00:46:16.989
Happy that the corrupt Romans were forced to leave?

00:46:16.989 --> 00:46:21.989
Remember though, Jerusalem was not important to Christians.

00:46:21.989 --> 00:46:24.989
It was not the place of safety.

00:46:24.989 --> 00:46:29.989
Christians needed to be alert and decisive and not distracted.

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:37.400
Then around July, August, many of him, the leader of another Jewish faction,

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:45.739
overran the Roman fortress of Masada and seized Roman weapons from there.

00:46:45.739 --> 00:46:52.739
He then returned to Jerusalem and captured the tower or fortress of Antonia.

00:46:52.739 --> 00:47:03.110
They set fire to Herod's palace, the palaces of a gripper and Bernice, as well as High Priest Ananias' home.

00:47:03.110 --> 00:47:08.110
Then they ordered the murder of High Priest Ananias and his brother Hezekiah.

00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:17.110
Following that, they returned to the fortress of Antonia and massacred the garrison of Roman soldiers still there.

00:47:17.110 --> 00:47:20.110
The city was divided and in uproar.

00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:31.880
Do you see how easy it would have been to join sides with one of the factions?

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:36.880
Remember though, these events were not important to Christians.

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:42.880
They needed to be alert and decisive and not distracted.

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:52.880
Finally around November, Sestia's garrison, the governor of Syria, marched with his troops and camped about six miles from Jerusalem.

00:47:53.880 --> 00:48:01.880
Even though it was the Sabbath day, the Jewish rebels screamed out of the city and made a hasty assault on the Romans.

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:08.880
The Romans retreated to Beth horn and the Jews captured Roman supplies and weapons.

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:19.880
A gripper sent two representatives, his personal friends, to the Jewish rebels, to persuade them to lay down their weapons and to promise them clemacy.

00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:26.929
But the rebels killed one of the men and wounded the other.

00:48:26.929 --> 00:48:41.039
Sestia pursued the rebels to Jerusalem, camped at Mount Scopus for three days and then started to undermine the city wall and tried to set fire to the gate of the temple.

00:48:41.039 --> 00:48:49.039
But then, for some unexpected reason, Gallus and his army retreated.

00:48:49.039 --> 00:48:56.039
Alert Christians in Jerusalem and Judea immediately acted decisively and fled.

00:48:56.039 --> 00:49:03.039
The rebels chased the Roman army, inflicting considerable losses in both men and supplies.

00:49:03.039 --> 00:49:07.039
And Gallus ordered his soldiers to retreat.

00:49:07.039 --> 00:49:15.039
After seven days, the Jewish rebels gave up chasing the Romans and pillaged the supplies left behind.

00:49:15.039 --> 00:49:18.039
They returned to Jerusalem after eight days.

00:49:18.039 --> 00:49:24.699
What was the situation in Jerusalem at that time?

00:49:24.699 --> 00:49:36.699
Josephus says, in the face of the exhilaration which now sees Jerusalem, the spokesmen for peace with Rome were obliged to remain silent.

00:49:36.699 --> 00:49:42.699
Even those opposed the war were swept along by the force of the circumstances.

00:49:42.699 --> 00:49:45.699
Those who supported Rome left.

00:49:45.699 --> 00:49:53.699
All the rest were won over to the side of the rebels partly by force, partly by persuasion.

00:49:53.699 --> 00:50:00.110
If you were there, what would you have done?

00:50:00.110 --> 00:50:06.110
Many Jews started to flee to Jerusalem seeking refuge there.

00:50:06.110 --> 00:50:08.110
But was it a safe refuge?

00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:10.110
No.

00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:16.110
There was anarchy in the city, several Jewish political factions fought each other.

00:50:16.110 --> 00:50:22.110
Eventually in 70 CE, Jerusalem was destroyed along with its temple.

00:50:22.110 --> 00:50:31.110
But the Christians who were alert and decisive were safe, far away in Pella, on the other side of the Jordan River.

00:50:31.110 --> 00:50:38.900
What do we learn from this brief review of the events of 66 CE?

00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:44.900
It wasn't just one event, wasn't, but a series of events.

00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:49.900
Were you amazed at how many events occurred in 66 CE?

00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:51.900
And that was just a brief summary.

00:50:51.900 --> 00:51:01.500
There were many divisive political and religious issues that could have been distracting to Christians.

00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:06.500
So those Christians needed to remain focused on their hope.

00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:12.500
They needed to remember that Jerusalem and its temple gave no security for them.

00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:19.099
Why should we be so interested in all of this today?

00:51:19.099 --> 00:51:27.099
Notice what else Jesus said as recorded at Luke chapter 21 verses 34 through 36.

00:51:27.099 --> 00:51:33.469
But pay attention to yourselves, that your hearts never become weighed down

00:51:33.469 --> 00:51:42.469
with of reading and heavy drinking and anxieties of life, and suddenly that they be instantly upon you as a snare.

00:51:42.469 --> 00:51:48.469
For it will come upon all those dwelling on the face of the whole earth.

00:51:48.469 --> 00:51:57.469
Keep awake then, all the time making supplication, that you may succeed in escaping all these things that must occur

00:51:57.469 --> 00:52:00.469
and in standing before the Son of Man.

00:52:00.469 --> 00:52:10.059
Jesus said that these things would occur on the face of the whole earth.

00:52:10.059 --> 00:52:15.059
That means he wasn't just talking about Christians in the first century.

00:52:15.059 --> 00:52:19.059
He was talking about us today.

00:52:19.059 --> 00:52:23.059
Yes, we need to pay attention and be alert.

00:52:23.059 --> 00:52:30.059
He also reminded us to make supplication, yes, to strengthen our relationship with Jehovah.

00:52:34.139 --> 00:52:37.139
What does this mean for us today?

00:52:37.139 --> 00:52:41.139
As we face the great tribulation brothers and sisters,

00:52:41.139 --> 00:52:46.139
we don't know exactly all the details of what will happen.

00:52:46.139 --> 00:52:52.139
But we do know that Jesus did not mean that we would have to flee one literal city

00:52:52.139 --> 00:52:54.139
or go to a certain mountain range.

00:52:54.139 --> 00:52:56.139
How could we?

00:52:56.139 --> 00:52:59.139
We're scattered over the whole face of the earth.

00:52:59.139 --> 00:53:06.139
But we do need to remember the same things that the first century Christians needed to remember.

00:53:06.139 --> 00:53:13.139
Don't put out trust in the religious and political systems of Satan's world.

00:53:13.139 --> 00:53:16.139
Why is this so vital?

00:53:16.139 --> 00:53:24.139
Just as in 66 CE, today we see one event after another leading up to the final day.

00:53:24.139 --> 00:53:30.139
Everywhere, there is evidence of political instability and infighting.

00:53:30.139 --> 00:53:35.139
Not only among nations, but also within nations.

00:53:35.139 --> 00:53:44.139
Religious political and social issues, including abortion and homosexuality, have become divisive topics.

00:53:44.139 --> 00:53:52.610
Scientific issues, such as global warming, have also become political issues.

00:53:52.610 --> 00:53:57.610
Just as in the first century, we must take to heart Jesus' warning.

00:53:57.610 --> 00:54:02.610
Don't take sides in the chaos that's happening all around us.

00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:12.300
Yes, keep your focus on the kingdom of hope.

00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:21.300
Remember, soon we will face events that will test our integrity as never before.

00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:23.300
So what are the takeaway points?

00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:31.300
Well, first of all, we realize that now is the time we need to make decisions and stick to those decisions.

00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:38.300
Yes, we need to be absolutely determined not to put our faith and trust in worldly politics.

00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:43.300
We need to remain neutral, always thinking of God's kingdom.

00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:48.300
We also need to remember that it's not just one event coming up in the future.

00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:51.300
There can be a series of events all happening at the same time.

00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:53.300
There could be distracting.

00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:58.300
But if we have made up our decision now, we'll be ready for that time.

00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:03.300
And also, we remember the need to keep our relationship strong with Jehovah God.

00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:06.300
And we remember the compassion of Jesus.

00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:11.300
So Jehovah and Jesus want us to be protected at that time.

00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:19.300
So may we be determined to continue to be alert and decisive.

00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:30.460
Well, that was really interesting, wasn't it?

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:34.460
A lot of work went into that video, but I'm sure glad we saw it.

00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:37.460
It certainly brought everything home to us.

00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:42.460
Well, the brothers in Ukraine have been in our prayers.

00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:46.460
And as we know, many fled the country because of the war.

00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:50.460
Some of them, when they fled, they just had the clothes on their back

00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:52.460
or just a little bit more than that.

00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:58.460
So the question is, how were they cared for in their new country?

00:55:58.460 --> 00:56:03.460
Well, this next video, just a short one, is going to tell us about the love

00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:07.460
that was shown to our brothers in neighboring countries

00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:14.460
and the tremendous amount of work that was involved in caring for these refugees.

00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:23.460
We thought that this might be some kind of pushing between the empires.

00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:27.460
But something else happened, the worst case scenario.

00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:33.460
We were aware of the fact that we had to prepare for some serious changes.

00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:36.460
There were thousands of people at the border.

00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:41.460
People had to wait in long queues, several kilometers long.

00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:45.460
Almost every day, we received 200 or more refugees,

00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:51.460
our brothers and sisters who were seeking refuge in Poland.

00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:55.460
It was really touching, since most of them had only one bag.

00:56:55.460 --> 00:57:01.179
It was not possible to take more.

00:57:01.179 --> 00:57:04.179
The brothers of the coordinators and committee of the governing body

00:57:04.179 --> 00:57:09.179
were analyzing with us about how to help and what we could do.

00:57:09.179 --> 00:57:14.940
Immediately, the first disaster relief committee was set up.

00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:21.940
And when we realized that there was already a need in the whole of Poland,

00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:25.940
16 committees started their work.

00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:34.940
The number of DC-50 applications of those who wanted to volunteer increased every week by thousands,

00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:40.940
indicating that the willingness and readiness to help was huge.

00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:45.940
We prepared everything in order to be able to welcome refugees at the border crossings,

00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:49.940
at the reception point set up by the authorities on Ukrainian border,

00:57:49.940 --> 00:57:54.940
and at other locations where the trains from Ukraine were arriving.

00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:59.940
We knew we would have to ask the congregations for accommodations.

00:57:59.940 --> 00:58:06.940
At the beginning, we prepared a survey that helped us to organize everything.

00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:09.940
We know that it's thanks to Jehovah's backing.

00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:17.940
Because in just a few days, we received more than 7,500 replies.

00:58:17.940 --> 00:58:25.940
For assembly halls and 22 kingdom halls were temporarily converted to refugee relief centers.

00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:32.340
The brothers were traveling for days and needed some basic things,

00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:37.340
hygienic products, diapers for children, and many other things.

00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:41.340
Not only clothes, but many basic necessities.

00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:47.340
They received food, they could warm up, take a shower, and get some rest.

00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:54.340
In addition to this, in many places, volunteers prepared rooms for donated garments,

00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:58.340
where brothers and sisters could choose clothing.

00:58:58.340 --> 00:59:03.340
In some places, brothers prepared special areas for children,

00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:10.340
where there were toys, crayons, something to draw on, something to play with,

00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:14.340
so that the children could feel busy there.

00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:22.039
Doing something helped them to get their minds off what they saw when they were fleeing.

00:59:22.039 --> 00:59:26.039
The children expressed their gratitude in their pictures.

00:59:26.039 --> 00:59:29.039
Almost everywhere, they wrote,

00:59:29.039 --> 00:59:32.039
Thank you.

00:59:32.039 --> 00:59:37.039
They drew pictures of paradise, expressions of their hope.

00:59:37.039 --> 00:59:40.860
It was so touching.

00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:46.860
The circuit overseers, together with the elders, did something absolutely spectacular.

00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:53.860
In the beginning, some of these brothers made hundreds of shepherding calls in two or three weeks.

00:59:53.860 --> 01:00:02.539
The goal was to deliver 40,000 humanitarian aid boxes.

01:00:02.539 --> 01:00:10.539
We were responsible for purchasing food, hygiene products, some first aid items, medical supplies.

01:00:10.539 --> 01:00:15.539
We had to find a logistical location where we could store all of this.

01:00:15.539 --> 01:00:21.539
Afterward, we had to think about how to pack it, how to deliver it to the border,

01:00:21.539 --> 01:00:27.539
and then how to transport it to Ukraine, where at this very moment, the war continued.

01:00:27.539 --> 01:00:32.539
It was very nice to observe the volunteers who came to help us pack up the supplies.

01:00:32.539 --> 01:00:36.539
When the brothers from all over the country got to know about the need,

01:00:36.539 --> 01:00:43.539
they were ready to drive 300 or more kilometers from many hours to devote a couple of hours to packing boxes.

01:00:43.539 --> 01:00:51.710
As it turned out later on, it was more or less 190 tons of supplies.

01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:55.710
In each package, we also put some drawings made by children.

01:00:55.710 --> 01:00:59.710
It was an expression of love in those humanitarian aid boxes.

01:00:59.710 --> 01:01:13.840
Having this opportunity to help the brothers, we saw an expression of Jehovah's love and might in all these efforts.

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:20.840
Only Jehovah could prepare his people for such a well-organized and effective activity.

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:28.840
Many of the brothers have commented that the fact that they see so much being done to help the brothers in Ukraine right now

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:35.840
convinces them that if they're in that situation in the future, if they're sometime when they need that love or they need that help,

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:39.840
well, Jehovah's organization is going to be there to help them as well.

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:47.840
Belonging to Jehovah's household, being part of a worldwide family is priceless.

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:56.840
The hatred in the world continues to grow constantly, and there's just more conflict and disunity.

01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:07.840
At the same time, the unity and the love of Jehovah's people just keeps on increasing, and it just becomes more and more powerful.

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:19.610
So we want to thank all those who had a share in providing that humanitarian assistance.

01:02:19.610 --> 01:02:27.610
A lot of work, a lot of thought, a lot of planning went into that, and it certainly is appreciated.

01:02:27.610 --> 01:02:35.610
But now, how did the brothers from Ukraine get to these neighboring countries?

01:02:35.610 --> 01:02:39.610
Well, they had some pretty hair-raising experiences.

01:02:39.610 --> 01:03:11.349
So the next video is going to recount some of their experiences, and you may need to have a hanky handy.

01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:14.349
We thought it might be a truck driving by.

01:03:14.349 --> 01:03:19.349
When it happened again, we got up and started reading the news on the internet,

01:03:19.349 --> 01:03:26.630
and we found out that there were explosions happening in all the cities.

01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:30.630
My mom awoke from her sleep to sirens sounding all over the city.

01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:35.630
Of course, we were very anxious and turned on the TV immediately,

01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:38.630
but we didn't even have to look for information,

01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:43.630
because all the channels were already talking about the fact that war had started.

01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:47.630
We just immediately started praying to Jehovah,

01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:51.630
calling friends and close ones, and asking how they were,

01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:56.329
and waiting for guidance from the brothers.

01:03:56.329 --> 01:04:00.329
At 5.30 a.m., a brother from Kyiv called us,

01:04:00.329 --> 01:04:05.469
and said that the bombs were landing in Kyiv.

01:04:05.469 --> 01:04:12.469
We immediately got up, woke up the children, and told them about the situation,

01:04:12.469 --> 01:04:15.469
and we didn't let the children go to school.

01:04:15.469 --> 01:04:20.940
We realized that our lives had changed.

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:26.940
We read the daily text, but I want to note that this scripture is well known for us.

01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:30.940
It used to be a year text, and of course we knew it,

01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:33.940
but at that moment it sounded special.

01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:39.940
I mean it was like personal guidance, such a personal answer from Jehovah to everyone,

01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:43.940
and I understood what I had to do.

01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:49.940
In that day, brothers created a Zoom meeting that ran for the whole day,

01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:53.940
and brothers and sisters could connect via Zoom to preach,

01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:56.940
talk to each other, and support each other.

01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:59.940
We were all together.

01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:02.940
Every day it became more difficult.

01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:10.860
It became more difficult to deliver food, and the food became more expensive.

01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:20.369
People started to panic, which led to panic buying of medicines,

01:05:20.369 --> 01:05:24.369
and basic staple products.

01:05:24.369 --> 01:05:28.369
Yes, before that, during the pandemic, for two years now,

01:05:28.369 --> 01:05:33.369
brothers had been constantly reminding us of the necessity of go-bags.

01:05:33.369 --> 01:05:36.369
And then, closer to the war,

01:05:36.369 --> 01:05:41.369
reminders also began to come from brothers about not only stocking up on such backpacks,

01:05:41.369 --> 01:05:45.369
but also about checking what condition they were in.

01:05:45.369 --> 01:05:49.369
And it was also recommended to stock up on food for two months in advance.

01:05:49.369 --> 01:05:56.119
When the war started, we were really frightened,

01:05:56.119 --> 01:05:59.119
because I was in my ninth month of pregnancy,

01:05:59.119 --> 01:06:02.119
and I could go into labor at any moment.

01:06:02.119 --> 01:06:04.119
We prayed a lot.

01:06:04.119 --> 01:06:06.119
We wanted to work out what to do next,

01:06:06.119 --> 01:06:09.119
what the right thing for us to do was.

01:06:09.119 --> 01:06:13.119
We weren't sure what was going on, and how it would end.

01:06:13.119 --> 01:06:17.119
But when we heard that next to us, they bombed a hospital,

01:06:17.119 --> 01:06:22.119
and they bombed a dormitory, we understood.

01:06:22.119 --> 01:06:26.659
We had to find a safer place.

01:06:26.659 --> 01:06:30.659
It was then that my husband made the decision that we should go.

01:06:30.659 --> 01:06:34.659
We couldn't leave because I wasn't able to travel,

01:06:34.659 --> 01:06:39.659
even to transport me from one room to the other was a problem.

01:06:39.659 --> 01:06:43.659
So the situation really was such that in our case,

01:06:43.659 --> 01:06:46.659
it was very difficult to leave,

01:06:46.659 --> 01:06:49.659
and it was very hard to stay,

01:06:49.659 --> 01:06:56.340
because almost every day the area was being shell.

01:06:56.340 --> 01:07:00.340
My dad isn't quite a difficult condition right now.

01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:03.340
He is completely blind with poor hearing.

01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:06.340
He had a stroke,

01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:09.340
and broke his hip a few months ago.

01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:12.340
So now he is completely bedridden,

01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:15.340
and requires constant care.

01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:20.340
Patti's mom is hard of hearing, and she broke her arm.

01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:24.340
It is our duty to take care of our parents.

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:27.340
It is a commandment that Jehovah gave,

01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:33.340
but we did not know how we could do it in this situation.

01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:37.340
When the war started in the first days of it,

01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:41.340
my grandfather had a second stroke,

01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:45.340
and worries about him were added to the situation.

01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:48.340
We had to take care of him,

01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:51.340
because he could not eat.

01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:54.340
Only my mom, my older brother,

01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:58.340
my grandmother and I are Jehovah's Witnesses in our family.

01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:01.340
My dad was worried about my safety.

01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:04.340
We understood that out of our whole family,

01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:06.340
I was the only one you could leave.

01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:13.679
Before we left, my husband called an elder from our congregation.

01:08:13.679 --> 01:08:17.680
He and his wife were already in the west of Ukraine at the time,

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:20.680
and they gave us a lot of advice.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:23.680
They gave us advice on how to behave at roadblocks,

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:27.680
that we should hide our phones and not take photos of anything.

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:30.680
They were advising us on which villages to go through,

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:33.680
because there were very big traffic jams at the time,

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:37.680
and people were stopped in some traffic jams for 10 or 12 hours.

01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:42.020
There were no lights.

01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:45.020
We drove large sections of the road in one go,

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:48.020
constantly praying that we wouldn't get a flat tire,

01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:51.020
that the car wouldn't break down,

01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:53.020
and that we wouldn't get stuck in a field.

01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:58.750
Before each checkpoint, we were so nervous,

01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:04.180
because local militia, when drunk,

01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:06.180
could be unpredictable,

01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:09.180
but since they had weapons,

01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:11.180
combat weapons,

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:14.180
we were afraid not only of the invaders,

01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:17.779
but the locals as well.

01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:24.029
I don't think we ever prayed as much as we did during those hours on the road.

01:09:24.029 --> 01:09:29.380
My husband tried to stay as calm as possible,

01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:35.479
and reassure me so that I wouldn't worry.

01:09:35.479 --> 01:09:39.479
A sister found out that there would be an evacuation train,

01:09:39.479 --> 01:09:42.479
and we kind of wanted to get on it,

01:09:42.479 --> 01:09:45.479
but we were not sure that we would,

01:09:46.479 --> 01:09:49.479
but this time with prayers,

01:09:49.479 --> 01:09:52.479
she managed to organize the transportation,

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:55.479
and both our families went.

01:09:55.479 --> 01:09:58.479
It was amazing that this train had a special carriage

01:09:58.479 --> 01:10:01.479
for people with disabilities,

01:10:01.479 --> 01:10:04.479
and we were taken to this carriage,

01:10:04.479 --> 01:10:08.479
and the train was even delayed until we sat down.

01:10:08.479 --> 01:10:11.479
They were waiting for us.

01:10:11.479 --> 01:10:14.479
Before we left, we informed the elders

01:10:14.479 --> 01:10:16.479
that we had made up our minds,

01:10:16.479 --> 01:10:18.479
and we were going.

01:10:18.479 --> 01:10:21.479
The brothers sent us a certain amount of money.

01:10:21.479 --> 01:10:22.479
They said,

01:10:22.479 --> 01:10:24.479
this is to help you,

01:10:24.479 --> 01:10:26.479
and when we boarded the train,

01:10:26.479 --> 01:10:29.479
we found out that we had to pay for the train.

01:10:29.479 --> 01:10:31.479
Although before that,

01:10:31.479 --> 01:10:33.479
all evacuation trains were free,

01:10:33.479 --> 01:10:35.479
they told us the amount for the tickets,

01:10:35.479 --> 01:10:38.479
and it was exactly the same

01:10:38.479 --> 01:10:40.479
as what the brothers had given us.

01:10:40.479 --> 01:10:43.479
The only opportunity for me to leave

01:10:43.479 --> 01:10:46.479
was by evacuation train.

01:10:46.479 --> 01:10:50.479
Usually, a department is designed for four people.

01:10:50.479 --> 01:10:55.340
In ours, there were 13 of us.

01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:57.340
On the train,

01:10:57.340 --> 01:11:01.340
I was traveling with the family for my congregation.

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:03.340
In order to reduce our worries

01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:06.340
and switch to something positive,

01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:08.340
we decided to take the opportunity

01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:12.340
and preach to the people.

01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:16.840
We drove for 16 hours,

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:19.840
and we arrived very late.

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:22.840
In Lviv, a group of police approached

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:25.840
and took me to the security service of Ukraine.

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:29.630
Since I have a Russian passport,

01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:32.630
I'm essentially like an enemy to them.

01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:36.359
I knew that Jehovah was with Dad,

01:11:36.359 --> 01:11:38.359
that he would protect him,

01:11:38.359 --> 01:11:40.359
and that most likely,

01:11:40.359 --> 01:11:42.359
he would not be dragged there to prison

01:11:42.359 --> 01:11:44.359
or something like that.

01:11:44.359 --> 01:11:49.960
But I was worried that they might simply not let us go further,

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:52.960
and we would stay in Ukraine.

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:58.260
I sat and waited.

01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:01.260
I prayed to Jehovah,

01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:03.260
and this helped me,

01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:06.260
not to focus on my negative thoughts,

01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:09.260
but to trust Jehovah completely.

01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:15.819
They begin to incite me to say such slogans as,

01:12:15.819 --> 01:12:18.819
glory to Ukraine.

01:12:18.819 --> 01:12:20.819
I answered,

01:12:20.819 --> 01:12:22.819
I'm one of Jehovah's Witnesses,

01:12:22.819 --> 01:12:24.819
and we take a neutral position in this war.

01:12:24.819 --> 01:12:26.819
We do not support the Russian side,

01:12:26.819 --> 01:12:32.100
but I also cannot glorify some other country,

01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:39.029
and then he told me to curse Putin.

01:12:39.029 --> 01:12:44.029
I said, well, since I am a believer,

01:12:44.029 --> 01:12:47.029
I cannot speak swear words,

01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:50.819
so I cannot say this either.

01:12:50.819 --> 01:12:54.819
And the policeman said, yes, I know your people.

01:12:54.819 --> 01:12:56.819
They don't want to defend their homeland.

01:12:56.819 --> 01:12:58.819
I replied, well,

01:12:58.819 --> 01:13:00.819
if I were a conscript,

01:13:00.819 --> 01:13:02.819
I would fight against Ukraine now,

01:13:02.819 --> 01:13:04.819
since I am Russian.

01:13:04.819 --> 01:13:07.819
He said, well, then save your family.

01:13:07.819 --> 01:13:11.579
Go with God, Alexey.

01:13:11.579 --> 01:13:13.579
He gave me back my documents,

01:13:13.579 --> 01:13:15.579
and wished me a good journey.

01:13:15.579 --> 01:13:20.579
We waited at the border for about 17 hours.

01:13:20.579 --> 01:13:23.579
The difficulty was that it was very cold.

01:13:24.579 --> 01:13:28.579
The car got cold quickly, and there were no toilets.

01:13:28.579 --> 01:13:30.579
As it was our turn to be checked,

01:13:30.579 --> 01:13:32.579
we spoke to the female border guard,

01:13:32.579 --> 01:13:35.579
and explained to her that I could go into labor at any time,

01:13:35.579 --> 01:13:38.579
and that I really needed my husband's help.

01:13:38.579 --> 01:13:41.579
I couldn't even carry my own bag.

01:13:41.579 --> 01:13:43.579
Then she told me that if I wanted,

01:13:43.579 --> 01:13:45.579
I could stay in Ukraine,

01:13:45.579 --> 01:13:58.100
but there was no way my husband would be allowed to leave.

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:02.100
Our final destination was the city of Helm in Poland,

01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:04.100
where we arrived.

01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:06.100
And there was an outburst of emotions

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:10.100
when the volunteers quickly brought us to the sisters.

01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:13.100
And we saw this JW.org sign.

01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:16.100
There were so many emotions.

01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:18.100
That is, well,

01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:20.100
it took our breath away,

01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:22.100
and we just couldn't speak.

01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:24.100
And now, indeed,

01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:27.100
this was the moment when we understood

01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:29.100
that this is it.

01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:34.229
We were saved.

01:14:34.229 --> 01:14:36.229
When we arrived at the Kingdom Hall,

01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:41.409
we were feeling really emotional.

01:14:41.409 --> 01:14:45.409
We were very worried and nervous about what was going to happen.

01:14:45.409 --> 01:14:48.409
But once we entered the Kingdom Hall,

01:14:48.409 --> 01:14:51.409
we were able to calm down.

01:14:51.409 --> 01:14:53.409
There were a lot of local brothers and sisters

01:14:53.409 --> 01:14:56.409
who greeted us with hugs.

01:14:56.409 --> 01:14:58.409
Many even had tears in their eyes

01:14:58.409 --> 01:15:01.409
when they saw that I was going to have a baby soon.

01:15:01.409 --> 01:15:03.409
At that moment,

01:15:03.409 --> 01:15:05.409
we realized that Jehovah and our brotherhood

01:15:05.409 --> 01:15:08.409
will take care of us as their own family

01:15:08.409 --> 01:15:14.199
and whatever circumstances we find ourselves.

01:15:14.199 --> 01:15:18.199
I sat in the Kingdom Hall and didn't know what to plan next.

01:15:18.199 --> 01:15:21.199
The elder who was on shift at the Kingdom Hall took time for me

01:15:21.199 --> 01:15:24.199
and he encouraged me very much.

01:15:24.199 --> 01:15:27.199
He acknowledged everything I had gone through and comforted me,

01:15:27.199 --> 01:15:30.199
letting me know that I was now safe.

01:15:30.199 --> 01:15:32.199
He assured me that Jehovah is with me,

01:15:32.199 --> 01:15:34.199
and will continue to support me,

01:15:34.199 --> 01:15:37.199
and that I have no reason to fear.

01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:40.199
I remember a moment when I went outside in the evening

01:15:40.199 --> 01:15:44.199
in the view of the Carpathian Mountains opened up to me.

01:15:44.199 --> 01:15:46.199
The birds were singing.

01:15:46.199 --> 01:15:49.199
It strengthened me so much.

01:15:49.199 --> 01:15:51.199
I remember the thought where a brother said

01:15:51.199 --> 01:15:53.199
that if Jehovah created all this,

01:15:53.199 --> 01:15:55.199
won't he help you?

01:15:55.199 --> 01:15:59.670
And while later I felt that power on myself

01:15:59.670 --> 01:16:02.670
when everything began to resolve so quickly,

01:16:02.670 --> 01:16:06.670
I didn't even think that it would resolve that way.

01:16:06.670 --> 01:16:09.670
My biggest fear is probably the fear of the unknown,

01:16:09.670 --> 01:16:14.500
but now we see that there is nothing to be afraid of.

01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:23.210
There was a disaster relief committee that helped to accommodate refugees,

01:16:23.210 --> 01:16:27.210
and the sisters working with the committee were looking for routes

01:16:27.210 --> 01:16:35.460
and looking for transport, buses, trains, and planes.

01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:38.460
We were accommodated with an amazing family.

01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:41.460
Where we felt really comfortable.

01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:44.460
We felt completely understood.

01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:47.460
It is simply incredible.

01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:52.460
Of course, Jehovah has accompanied us all these years.

01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:55.460
All these years we have been feeling is help.

01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:58.460
But now it is just like an avalanche,

01:16:58.460 --> 01:17:02.460
an avalanche of miracles, help, and support.

01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:06.899
Different brothers and sisters began to visit us straight away,

01:17:06.899 --> 01:17:09.899
and each time there was someone new.

01:17:09.899 --> 01:17:12.899
And they always brought some bags or boxes.

01:17:12.899 --> 01:17:18.590
And for the non-witnesses, it was like a miracle.

01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:20.590
And they kept asking,

01:17:20.590 --> 01:17:23.590
do you know them? Are these your relatives?

01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:25.590
No, we have never seen them before.

01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:27.590
Why are they helping you?

01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:30.590
Oh, it was such a good witness.

01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:36.840
On March 24, exactly a month after the war began.

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:40.840
Danielle and I gave birth to a beautiful baby girl.

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:47.310
It was a great help that a sister who could translate

01:17:47.310 --> 01:17:50.310
was present in the delivery room.

01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:52.310
This made me feel calmer.

01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:59.579
We tried to speak at every possible opportunity,

01:17:59.579 --> 01:18:01.579
sending each other text messages,

01:18:01.579 --> 01:18:05.579
and communicating via video conferencing.

01:18:05.579 --> 01:18:10.579
I sent Danielle videos and photos of our little girl, Mido Slava.

01:18:10.579 --> 01:18:17.100
And we constantly reassure each other of our love,

01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:20.100
and that we appreciate each other very much.

01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:28.939
Feeling forced to move to another country is very difficult.

01:18:28.939 --> 01:18:34.479
But thanks to Jehovah, I have become convinced

01:18:34.479 --> 01:18:39.479
that his organization really functions as one body.

01:18:39.479 --> 01:18:47.310
And I'm very happy to be part of it.

01:18:47.310 --> 01:18:49.310
The Brotherhood.

01:18:49.310 --> 01:18:54.310
These are the people waiting for you with open arms.

01:18:54.310 --> 01:19:02.739
We felt that it was Jehovah who personally helped us.

01:19:02.739 --> 01:19:08.020
It is really evident that a lot of refugees from Ukraine

01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:11.020
who come here are alone with their problems.

01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:15.909
And it is very difficult for them.

01:19:15.909 --> 01:19:20.909
How much easier it is for us because we have a friendly brotherhood with us.

01:19:20.909 --> 01:19:24.909
And although we are in a foreign country, we feel at home.

01:19:24.909 --> 01:19:26.909
All things go to Jehovah.

01:19:26.909 --> 01:20:33.859
Well, that was faith strengthening, wasn't it?

01:20:33.859 --> 01:20:39.859
No doubt that Jehovah is going to support us in any situation.

01:20:39.859 --> 01:20:43.859
So now we're going to give attention to Brother Tony Morris.

01:20:43.859 --> 01:20:44.859
Hi, Tony.

01:20:44.859 --> 01:20:45.859
Hey.

01:20:45.859 --> 01:20:49.859
What was your name again?

01:20:49.859 --> 01:20:53.859
And Brother Morris is going to talk to us on the theme.

01:20:53.859 --> 01:20:56.859
They will be sensational.

01:20:56.859 --> 01:21:04.619
Now, in a moment, it will explain what is going to be sensational.

01:21:04.619 --> 01:21:09.619
But first, please open your Bibles to Hebrews chapter 6

01:21:09.619 --> 01:21:15.600
or find it on your phone or tablet.

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:21.600
Now Paul here in this letter is addressing those with the heavenly hope.

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:25.600
And he makes a point here about two things.

01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:28.600
He covers in verse 17 of Hebrews 6,

01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:34.010
about the promise and the oath.

01:21:34.010 --> 01:21:37.010
So it's impossible for Jehovah to lie.

01:21:37.010 --> 01:21:39.010
Verse 18 touches on.

01:21:39.010 --> 01:21:46.010
But this is what's connected with this hope for the ones that have the heavenly hope

01:21:46.010 --> 01:21:49.010
and by extension, the other sheep.

01:21:49.010 --> 01:21:53.010
So it's infallible.

01:21:53.010 --> 01:21:56.010
It's going to happen just as he promised.

01:21:56.010 --> 01:22:02.010
And Paul, who at least three times experienced shipwreck,

01:22:02.010 --> 01:22:06.010
that much renewal, maybe find out there's more later,

01:22:06.010 --> 01:22:12.010
but notice what he writes here with a heartful of experience.

01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:21.010
In verse 19, we have this hope as an anchor for the soul,

01:22:21.010 --> 01:22:28.010
both sure and firm, and it enters in within the curtain, the anchor.

01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:35.010
And it's just critical that the other sheep and the anointed

01:22:35.010 --> 01:22:38.010
have their anchor in shape.

01:22:38.010 --> 01:22:44.010
Now, the watchtower just last year February, 2021,

01:22:44.010 --> 01:22:49.010
on page 30 mentioned this profound thought.

01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:53.010
An anchor stabilizes a ship during a storm,

01:22:53.010 --> 01:22:58.010
and it stops it from drifting onto rocks.

01:22:58.010 --> 01:23:05.010
But an anchor is useful only if the chain that attaches to the ship did not break.

01:23:05.010 --> 01:23:11.010
So if we lose our faith, we lose our hope.

01:23:11.010 --> 01:23:17.010
The watchtower addressed that profound thought to all of God's people.

01:23:17.010 --> 01:23:24.010
Now, for now, we're facing what Revelation chapter 21,

01:23:24.010 --> 01:23:29.010
in symbolic language, will turn to Revelation 21.

01:23:29.010 --> 01:23:37.010
And this is why it's so critical to have that clear about our hope,

01:23:37.010 --> 01:23:43.010
being the anchor there in verse 1 of Revelation 21.

01:23:43.010 --> 01:23:47.010
And I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the former heaven

01:23:47.010 --> 01:23:50.010
and the former earth had passed away.

01:23:50.010 --> 01:23:55.010
And notice, and this sea is no more.

01:23:55.010 --> 01:23:59.010
Well, the sea is no more.

01:23:59.010 --> 01:24:01.010
What are we talking about here?

01:24:01.010 --> 01:24:07.010
Well, that means that after Armageddon, there's no more sea.

01:24:07.010 --> 01:24:12.010
Well, obviously, that's not literal with the oceans or the seas there.

01:24:12.010 --> 01:24:18.010
That's the demon agitated sea of wicked mankind.

01:24:18.010 --> 01:24:23.010
Gone. But it's not gone yet.

01:24:23.010 --> 01:24:29.010
And just like in literal wars, submarines are used, sneak up on the ships.

01:24:29.010 --> 01:24:35.010
Well, Satan's same way, him and his demon horde.

01:24:35.010 --> 01:24:42.010
So he's going to use any means he can try to wreck our ship.

01:24:43.010 --> 01:24:46.010
It's an individual one I want with Jehovah.

01:24:46.010 --> 01:24:51.010
And you know, many of you, I look out see new couples that very close,

01:24:51.010 --> 01:24:59.010
love each other. Well, you know, your mate for those of you married,

01:24:59.010 --> 01:25:04.010
has to have this kind of relationship with their father, Jehovah.

01:25:04.010 --> 01:25:06.010
Everybody does.

01:25:06.010 --> 01:25:09.010
You know, unless you're a toddler,

01:25:09.010 --> 01:25:12.010
then you're going to be in God's hands.

01:25:12.010 --> 01:25:14.010
If your parents are witnesses,

01:25:14.010 --> 01:25:17.010
that's a good chance to be okay.

01:25:17.010 --> 01:25:19.010
So this is war.

01:25:19.010 --> 01:25:21.010
That's the point.

01:25:21.010 --> 01:25:23.010
This is war.

01:25:23.010 --> 01:25:27.010
And it's not going to get easier.

01:25:27.010 --> 01:25:30.010
See, till the sea is no more.

01:25:30.010 --> 01:25:37.010
Now, during these times, this war we face stormy seas,

01:25:38.010 --> 01:25:41.010
includes a lot of things, loss of material things,

01:25:41.010 --> 01:25:44.010
there's all kinds of other storms that come up

01:25:44.010 --> 01:25:48.010
and they're connected with the sea of wicked mankind.

01:25:48.010 --> 01:25:52.010
But this one here is what we're going to emphasize.

01:25:52.010 --> 01:25:55.010
The death of a loved one.

01:25:58.010 --> 01:26:01.010
The death of a loved one.

01:26:01.010 --> 01:26:06.270
What a storm.

01:26:06.270 --> 01:26:13.649
And that is when our anchor is essential as individuals.

01:26:13.649 --> 01:26:16.649
That anchor is essential.

01:26:16.649 --> 01:26:21.649
Never lose your anchor.

01:26:21.649 --> 01:26:23.649
Not saying you're not going to be battered,

01:26:23.649 --> 01:26:25.649
and I'm not going to be battered,

01:26:25.649 --> 01:26:29.649
but don't lose your anchor.

01:26:29.649 --> 01:26:32.649
Jehovah gave it to us,

01:26:32.649 --> 01:26:35.649
and Paul made that clear.

01:26:35.649 --> 01:26:38.649
Now, a sister wrote in,

01:26:38.649 --> 01:26:41.649
and I certainly wouldn't name her.

01:26:41.649 --> 01:26:44.649
She may eventually see this program here,

01:26:44.649 --> 01:26:48.649
but thought it was worth sharing with us.

01:26:48.649 --> 01:26:51.649
But she was honest and humble about it,

01:26:51.649 --> 01:26:54.649
but it shows, you know, God's people are imperfect.

01:26:54.649 --> 01:26:56.649
I don't know if you noticed that,

01:26:56.649 --> 01:26:59.649
but don't say anything, David,

01:26:59.649 --> 01:27:02.649
when they come out late.

01:27:02.649 --> 01:27:06.649
So her dad died faithful.

01:27:06.649 --> 01:27:10.470
Now, here's what she admits.

01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:12.470
Before her dad died,

01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:16.470
she says that when she saw others shedding tears after

01:27:16.470 --> 01:27:19.470
loved ones died, she thought,

01:27:19.470 --> 01:27:22.470
why do people cry so much?

01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:27.939
They will see them again.

01:27:27.939 --> 01:27:34.199
Would that comfort you if you just lost a loved one?

01:27:34.199 --> 01:27:36.199
No.

01:27:36.199 --> 01:27:40.199
However, her dad died.

01:27:40.199 --> 01:27:45.199
Here's what she honestly stated to her credit,

01:27:45.199 --> 01:27:53.529
but now I understand.

01:27:53.529 --> 01:27:59.159
And she wept shed tears.

01:27:59.159 --> 01:28:03.159
Yes, the loss of a loved one can be devastating.

01:28:03.159 --> 01:28:06.159
No doubt about his credible storm.

01:28:06.159 --> 01:28:09.760
Now to our theme,

01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:12.760
they will be sensational.

01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:15.760
What is they?

01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:21.760
They are family reunions in the new world.

01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:24.760
The things that are coming,

01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:27.760
oh, go ahead and use your imagination

01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:30.760
to hold a won't falter for that.

01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:33.760
They're going to be sensational.

01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:36.760
They really are.

01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:40.760
It's a word for sensationales astonishing.

01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:43.760
Another one is astounding.

01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:47.760
And it's nice that this is not a fantasy.

01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:49.760
This is what's going to happen.

01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:51.760
It's a reality.

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:55.760
So let's consider some families in Bible history,

01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:57.760
first of all,

01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:00.760
and we'll start with Noah.

01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:04.760
And he was born in 2970.

01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:08.760
B-C-E, 126 years after Adam's death.

01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:12.760
So he didn't have any interaction with Adam.

01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:15.760
I think he got a blessing there personally.

01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:18.760
And when his father, Lane, named him Noah,

01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:21.760
you know, that's in scripture,

01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:22.760
he said,

01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:25.760
this one will bring us comfort from our work

01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:27.760
and from the pain of our hands,

01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:33.100
resulting from the ground which Jehovah has cursed.

01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:37.100
Beautiful expression and boy, Noah lived up to that.

01:29:37.100 --> 01:29:41.100
When he lived, he faced and materialized angels.

01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:45.100
They left their proper dwelling place

01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:49.100
and produced offspring, those hybrid Nephilim.

01:29:49.100 --> 01:29:52.100
And the earth became full of violence.

01:29:52.100 --> 01:29:54.100
But knowing his family,

01:29:54.100 --> 01:29:58.100
they avoided all of that corruption.

01:29:58.100 --> 01:30:01.100
So he was fallless. He walked with the true God.

01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:06.100
Now, he lived up to what Jehovah expected of him

01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:09.100
and find Genesis, if you would please.

01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:16.100
And we're going to look at chapter 8, Genesis chapter 8.

01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:23.859
Now, I will mention this here in the chapter before 8,

01:30:23.859 --> 01:30:26.859
which would be chapter 7.

01:30:26.859 --> 01:30:29.859
We do find the point in verse 13.

01:30:29.859 --> 01:30:35.590
On that very day Noah went into the ark along with his sons,

01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:37.590
Shem, Ham, and Japheth,

01:30:37.590 --> 01:30:42.590
and noticed in his wife and the three wives of his sons.

01:30:42.590 --> 01:30:43.590
So they went in the ark.

01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:45.590
They had all worked around it and everything.

01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:52.590
And now we find in chapter 8, verses 16 and 17,

01:30:52.590 --> 01:30:55.590
after the flood,

01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:58.590
go out of the ark,

01:30:59.590 --> 01:31:03.590
you, your wife, your sons, and your sons' wives.

01:31:03.590 --> 01:31:06.590
So here we go.

01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:10.590
But we know that Shem, Ham, and Japheth,

01:31:10.590 --> 01:31:13.590
that's what the scripture said,

01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:22.060
we don't know the names of the wife or the sons' wives.

01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:25.949
Why?

01:31:25.949 --> 01:31:27.949
You're going to ask God,

01:31:27.949 --> 01:31:29.949
but I don't see anything in here.

01:31:29.949 --> 01:31:31.949
He decided not to have it in her.

01:31:31.949 --> 01:31:35.949
Has nothing to do with being worthy.

01:31:35.949 --> 01:31:38.949
It's all about the lineage that went through.

01:31:38.949 --> 01:31:42.949
And you know, we all know better than, you know,

01:31:42.949 --> 01:31:43.949
argue with God.

01:31:43.949 --> 01:31:46.949
You know, God, I really love your word,

01:31:46.949 --> 01:31:49.949
but you know, a couple of things here.

01:31:49.949 --> 01:31:54.949
Not too bright to have that kind of attitude.

01:31:54.949 --> 01:31:57.949
So these are beautiful, faithful women.

01:31:57.949 --> 01:31:59.949
And here's the point,

01:31:59.949 --> 01:32:01.949
during the new world,

01:32:01.949 --> 01:32:08.390
my, what a family reunion they're going to have.

01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:10.390
And how thrilled you're going to be,

01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:13.390
because I'm sure you've got some questions

01:32:13.390 --> 01:32:16.390
about what that was like, you know.

01:32:16.390 --> 01:32:18.390
And then we don't have much,

01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:20.390
while they were on the ark,

01:32:20.390 --> 01:32:22.390
how things go, I mean,

01:32:22.390 --> 01:32:24.390
you know, a lot of the old timers

01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:27.390
hear it, Bethel and other Bethels have so many stories

01:32:27.390 --> 01:32:29.390
in there, a pleasure.

01:32:29.390 --> 01:32:31.390
Well, get ready.

01:32:31.390 --> 01:32:34.390
Whole lot of sensational stories

01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:39.390
from sensational family reunions like this one.

01:32:39.390 --> 01:32:40.390
See?

01:32:40.390 --> 01:32:42.390
Wonderful, wonderful future.

01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:46.390
Now in the same Bible book, Genesis,

01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:49.390
let's go over to chapter 21.

01:32:49.390 --> 01:32:51.390
And,

01:32:51.390 --> 01:32:56.390
notice here, there's a different example of a family

01:32:56.390 --> 01:33:00.390
that'll enjoy a sensational reunion in the new world.

01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:03.390
It highlights the fact that Sarah

01:33:03.390 --> 01:33:04.390
became pregnant.

01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:07.390
And this is the love of Abraham's life

01:33:07.390 --> 01:33:09.390
as far as humans go.

01:33:09.390 --> 01:33:14.390
And they bore a son together, Isaac.

01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:17.390
And this is just incredible.

01:33:17.390 --> 01:33:22.390
You take chapter 22 of Genesis.

01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:25.390
Jehovah gives this direction.

01:33:25.390 --> 01:33:28.390
And then of you that are fathers,

01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:29.390
you're listening.

01:33:29.390 --> 01:33:31.390
And you don't have to be a father

01:33:31.390 --> 01:33:34.390
that would be touched by this, obviously,

01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:38.390
as you love Jehovah and you love Jesus.

01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:40.390
But he says in verse 2,

01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:43.390
Take please your son, your only son,

01:33:43.390 --> 01:33:45.390
whom you so love.

01:33:45.390 --> 01:33:48.390
Oh, yeah, he knew.

01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:50.390
Oh, Abraham.

01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:52.390
Sarah loves Isaac.

01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:56.390
And this is remarkable.

01:33:56.390 --> 01:33:58.390
He loves him so much.

01:33:58.390 --> 01:34:01.390
And what's he tell him to do?

01:34:01.390 --> 01:34:06.819
Sacrifice him.

01:34:06.819 --> 01:34:09.819
So we don't have all the

01:34:09.819 --> 01:34:11.819
or any record of any feelings

01:34:11.819 --> 01:34:15.819
that Abraham had during all this.

01:34:15.819 --> 01:34:17.819
We get some indication of

01:34:17.819 --> 01:34:19.819
something is going on here.

01:34:19.819 --> 01:34:24.819
But those of you that have ever had a son or sons,

01:34:24.819 --> 01:34:29.819
the impactor is just phenomenal.

01:34:29.819 --> 01:34:32.819
He did go all the way

01:34:32.819 --> 01:34:34.819
with the knife.

01:34:34.819 --> 01:34:36.819
And he'd actually,

01:34:36.819 --> 01:34:38.819
in mind and heart,

01:34:38.819 --> 01:34:44.449
committed the sacrifice.

01:34:44.449 --> 01:34:46.449
But Jehovah, you know,

01:34:46.449 --> 01:34:48.449
after he reached out to the knife

01:34:48.449 --> 01:34:50.449
and everything's in motion,

01:34:50.449 --> 01:34:53.449
Jehovah had the angel call out,

01:34:53.449 --> 01:34:54.449
Abraham.

01:34:54.449 --> 01:34:55.449
Abraham.

01:34:55.449 --> 01:34:57.449
Just in time that

01:34:57.449 --> 01:35:00.760
stopped the whole thing.

01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:01.760
And Abraham said,

01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:02.760
Here I am.

01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:04.760
And then he told him in verse 12,

01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:08.760
Do not harm the boy.

01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:10.760
How did he feel?

01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:11.760
Talk about our relief.

01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:13.760
And all this time,

01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:14.760
before Isaac's wondering,

01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:16.760
You know, we get this all set up.

01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:20.760
Where's the sheep?

01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:21.760
I don't know.

01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:23.760
He must have had some interesting conversations

01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:26.760
after these events.

01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:29.760
Now, you think that they're not going to enjoy

01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:32.760
a sensational family reunion?

01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:33.760
Oh, my.

01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:35.760
And then when they find out,

01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:36.760
because they didn't know,

01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:38.760
they heard certain things,

01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:40.760
Jehovah,

01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:41.760
he went all the way

01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:43.760
and allowed this sacrifice

01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:45.760
with his son.

01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:47.760
Ah.

01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:49.760
See that pain.

01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:51.760
A lot of pain.

01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:54.760
It's all a sensational family reunion.

01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:56.760
Abraham, Isaac's heir,

01:35:56.760 --> 01:35:59.760
and other family members.

01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:00.760
Now, another one in scripture.

01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:03.760
Let's find Job.

01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:08.760
And how well we know and appreciate.

01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:10.760
Job so much.

01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:15.739
And I'm going to go right there

01:36:15.739 --> 01:36:18.739
the first chapter.

01:36:18.739 --> 01:36:23.739
And it just helps us to appreciate

01:36:24.739 --> 01:36:26.739
in the first chapter here.

01:36:26.739 --> 01:36:30.739
Verse 1 talks about this upright man of integrity.

01:36:30.739 --> 01:36:34.739
And verse 2 reveals it.

01:36:34.739 --> 01:36:38.739
Seven sons and three daughters were born to him.

01:36:38.739 --> 01:36:40.739
And then all the livestocks mentioned.

01:36:40.739 --> 01:36:42.739
But this is quite interesting.

01:36:42.739 --> 01:36:44.739
In verse 4,

01:36:44.739 --> 01:36:46.739
chapter 1, each of his sons

01:36:46.739 --> 01:36:49.739
would hold a bank with at his house

01:36:49.739 --> 01:36:51.739
on his own set day.

01:36:52.739 --> 01:36:54.739
What's that all about?

01:36:54.739 --> 01:36:57.739
Well, we have the gift of the inside book.

01:36:57.739 --> 01:36:59.739
I suppose so many other references

01:36:59.739 --> 01:37:02.739
but there's always been a blessed gift.

01:37:02.739 --> 01:37:05.739
And the inside stated,

01:37:05.739 --> 01:37:07.739
it would seem that Job 7's sons

01:37:07.739 --> 01:37:10.739
held a family gathering.

01:37:10.739 --> 01:37:14.739
Possibly a spring or harvest festival.

01:37:14.739 --> 01:37:18.739
And as the feasting made the week-long circuit,

01:37:18.739 --> 01:37:23.739
each son hosted the banquet in his own house.

01:37:23.739 --> 01:37:27.739
That's a close family.

01:37:27.739 --> 01:37:28.739
They were all there.

01:37:28.739 --> 01:37:31.739
Just such a close family

01:37:31.739 --> 01:37:33.739
that loved each other.

01:37:33.739 --> 01:37:36.739
Just loved each other.

01:37:36.739 --> 01:37:40.739
However, we know in the following verses,

01:37:40.739 --> 01:37:43.739
the challenge of Satan in heaven

01:37:43.739 --> 01:37:46.739
and all that's recorded for us here.

01:37:46.739 --> 01:37:49.739
And then it starts.

01:37:49.739 --> 01:37:51.739
In verse 13,

01:37:51.739 --> 01:37:53.739
sons and daughters are eating there.

01:37:53.739 --> 01:37:55.739
And then the message comes to Job

01:37:55.739 --> 01:37:57.739
about the cattle,

01:37:57.739 --> 01:37:59.739
and Sabine's attacking.

01:37:59.739 --> 01:38:01.739
And then, you see,

01:38:01.739 --> 01:38:02.739
the wicked one,

01:38:02.739 --> 01:38:03.739
when he never said,

01:38:03.739 --> 01:38:05.739
he wasn't smart.

01:38:05.739 --> 01:38:06.739
Because he verse 16,

01:38:06.739 --> 01:38:08.739
fire from God.

01:38:08.739 --> 01:38:10.739
So, you know, now they're involved.

01:38:10.739 --> 01:38:13.739
They're going to blame God for this.

01:38:14.739 --> 01:38:17.739
They're all going to think it was God did this.

01:38:17.739 --> 01:38:19.739
Even though he's behind it.

01:38:19.739 --> 01:38:22.739
And it falls from there and kills the sheep.

01:38:22.739 --> 01:38:25.739
Well, then, verse 18 and 19,

01:38:25.739 --> 01:38:27.739
whether it's still speaking,

01:38:27.739 --> 01:38:29.739
your sons, your daughters were eating

01:38:29.739 --> 01:38:33.739
and drinking wine in their homeless brother's house.

01:38:33.739 --> 01:38:36.739
Suddenly a great win came.

01:38:36.739 --> 01:38:40.739
Apparently, Job allowed that kind of power in that case.

01:38:40.739 --> 01:38:46.170
Kill them all, dead.

01:38:46.170 --> 01:38:48.170
Kill them.

01:38:48.170 --> 01:38:53.170
So, seven sons and three daughters.

01:38:53.170 --> 01:38:56.170
Now, that's history.

01:38:56.170 --> 01:38:58.170
Let's go to Job 42,

01:38:58.170 --> 01:39:02.989
Job chapter 42,

01:39:02.989 --> 01:39:09.720
and see he's been through the test,

01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:12.720
and we find here

01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:16.720
where it mentions, you know,

01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:18.720
after things have passed here,

01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:20.720
and Job doubled everything,

01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:22.720
and he's just rich again.

01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:25.720
Verse 13, he also of 42,

01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:29.720
13, he also came to have seven more sons

01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:32.720
and three more daughters.

01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:34.720
Isn't that, I mean,

01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:37.720
just Job was so wonderful,

01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:40.720
but see, Job was not finished with him,

01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:44.720
because in the new world,

01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:47.720
and likely work out the timing,

01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:51.720
all 20 children.

01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:54.720
Job was away.

01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:55.720
Wow.

01:39:55.720 --> 01:40:00.029
Sensational family reunion.

01:40:00.029 --> 01:40:03.029
Now, more to our day,

01:40:03.029 --> 01:40:06.029
did just want to touch on,

01:40:06.029 --> 01:40:09.029
just saw it on the website.

01:40:09.029 --> 01:40:11.029
September 26, I think.

01:40:11.029 --> 01:40:13.029
A wonderful, beautiful story here,

01:40:13.029 --> 01:40:15.029
and it's been touched on within a week before,

01:40:15.029 --> 01:40:18.029
but this David Mazza's life story,

01:40:18.029 --> 01:40:22.029
happy family shattered and rebuilt,

01:40:22.029 --> 01:40:24.029
and they talk about David,

01:40:24.029 --> 01:40:26.029
or they call them David.

01:40:26.029 --> 01:40:28.029
I can't think of, boy,

01:40:28.029 --> 01:40:31.029
what a sensational family reunion

01:40:31.029 --> 01:40:33.029
they're going to have,

01:40:33.029 --> 01:40:36.029
see, during the new world.

01:40:36.029 --> 01:40:38.029
So, we know you precious brother

01:40:38.029 --> 01:40:41.029
a lot of you are numb of heart,

01:40:41.029 --> 01:40:44.029
losing loved ones during these last days,

01:40:44.029 --> 01:40:48.029
but please, don't lose heart.

01:40:48.029 --> 01:40:51.029
You got your anchor, see.

01:40:51.029 --> 01:40:53.029
And then the sister wraps it up

01:40:53.029 --> 01:40:56.029
for her dear friend of mine.

01:40:56.029 --> 01:40:59.029
My mother and father had 17 children,

01:40:59.029 --> 01:41:02.029
just recently she wrote this.

01:41:02.029 --> 01:41:05.029
Recently, I lost the last remaining sibling,

01:41:05.029 --> 01:41:09.029
leaving me with no siblings at all.

01:41:09.029 --> 01:41:11.029
Strangely, I remember where I was

01:41:11.029 --> 01:41:16.029
and what I was doing when I lost each of them.

01:41:16.029 --> 01:41:18.029
What a blessing it will be

01:41:18.029 --> 01:41:22.029
when these dreaded memories will be gone and replaced,

01:41:22.029 --> 01:41:26.029
when I see my resurrected mom and dad welcome back,

01:41:26.029 --> 01:41:30.029
each child who stored in Jehovah's memory.

01:41:30.029 --> 01:41:34.029
She writes, what a grand reunion that will be.

01:41:34.029 --> 01:41:37.029
So, as we gradually grow to perfection

01:41:37.029 --> 01:41:40.029
with the prospect of living forever.

01:41:40.029 --> 01:41:44.029
What a touching expression from our precious sister.

01:41:44.029 --> 01:41:48.029
So, the reunion with your loved ones is a certainty.

01:41:48.029 --> 01:41:54.029
You will be enjoying your family reunions soon.

01:41:54.029 --> 01:41:58.659
Keep your anchor in good shape

01:41:58.659 --> 01:42:01.659
till the sea of wicked man kind is no more.

01:42:01.659 --> 01:42:04.659
We entreat you focus on the coming,

01:42:04.659 --> 01:42:26.300
sensational family reunions.

01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:30.300
Well, wasn't that touching?

01:42:30.300 --> 01:42:32.300
Really encouraging.

01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:35.300
So, we appreciate that very much, Tony.

01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:37.300
Now, this time I have an announcement to make

01:42:37.300 --> 01:42:42.300
and it concerns the worldwide Bethel family.

01:42:42.300 --> 01:42:46.300
The worldwide Bethel family.

01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:49.300
Now, as you know, the elders received training

01:42:49.300 --> 01:42:52.300
at the school for congregation elders.

01:42:52.300 --> 01:42:55.300
But we have a lot of elders at Bethel.

01:42:55.300 --> 01:42:59.300
And many of them have a tremendous amount of experience.

01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:03.300
But they have a lot of responsibility too.

01:43:03.300 --> 01:43:05.300
And many of them are overseers.

01:43:05.300 --> 01:43:08.300
They oversee large departments.

01:43:08.300 --> 01:43:12.300
So, what do we do to meet their needs?

01:43:12.300 --> 01:43:14.300
What about a new course?

01:43:14.300 --> 01:43:19.300
A new course for those in oversight positions.

01:43:19.300 --> 01:43:23.300
It's called Principles of Divine Oversight,

01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:27.300
a school for overseers.

01:43:27.300 --> 01:43:31.300
Now, let's let a couple of brothers tell us more about it.

01:43:31.300 --> 01:43:38.020
Welcome to the School for Overseers,

01:43:38.020 --> 01:43:43.020
Principles of Divine Oversight, Acts 6-3.

01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:46.020
I invite you to read with me the verse that is the basis

01:43:46.020 --> 01:43:50.020
for this school, Acts 6-3.

01:43:50.020 --> 01:43:54.020
So, brothers, select for yourself seven reputable men

01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:57.020
from among you full of spirit and wisdom

01:43:57.020 --> 01:44:01.020
that we may appoint them over this necessary matter.

01:44:01.020 --> 01:44:05.020
Due to the rapid expansion of the work taking place around the world,

01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:10.020
there's a pressing need for more loving and effective overseas.

01:44:10.020 --> 01:44:14.020
What would you say are the marks of a good overseer?

01:44:14.020 --> 01:44:19.020
An overseer's primary job is to take care of people.

01:44:19.020 --> 01:44:24.020
He humbly accepts the reality that he does not know everything

01:44:24.020 --> 01:44:26.020
or have all the answers.

01:44:26.020 --> 01:44:30.020
Don't get stuck in the past.

01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:34.020
Be the point of contact for your fellow workers.

01:44:34.020 --> 01:44:37.020
A good overseer is all of those,

01:44:37.020 --> 01:44:41.020
but he must also follow the divine pattern of oversight.

01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:48.020
Training is essential, but how it's done is crucial.

01:44:48.020 --> 01:44:53.020
To this end, Principles of Divine Oversight, Acts 6-3,

01:44:53.020 --> 01:44:58.020
a school for overseers will help brothers and oversight prepare others

01:44:58.020 --> 01:45:03.020
to become loving and effective overseers in the future.

01:45:03.020 --> 01:45:06.020
The school is rooted in Bible Principles.

01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:12.020
Let's read together the last scripture in Ezekiel chapter 48.

01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:15.020
Verse 35 says,

01:45:15.020 --> 01:45:22.020
And the name of the city from that day on will be Jehovah is there.

01:45:22.020 --> 01:45:26.020
Brothers, when you apply the divine pattern of oversight

01:45:26.020 --> 01:45:30.020
by proactively training others and humbly keeping your gates open

01:45:30.020 --> 01:45:32.020
to fresh lines of thought,

01:45:32.020 --> 01:45:38.020
you can be absolutely sure that Jehovah will reward your sincere efforts.

01:45:38.020 --> 01:45:43.020
Yes, divine blessings will not only flow into your department,

01:45:43.020 --> 01:45:46.020
but they will cascade throughout your entire branch,

01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:50.020
bring refreshment and continue spreading across the world.

01:45:50.020 --> 01:45:57.020
And Jehovah's great spiritual city will continue to grow and flourish.

01:45:57.020 --> 01:46:08.899
It's a good course.

01:46:08.899 --> 01:46:11.899
But we tried it out already on a few Bethelites,

01:46:11.899 --> 01:46:15.899
and they appreciated it very much.

01:46:15.899 --> 01:46:18.899
So we're sure that this is going to be a real blessing,

01:46:18.899 --> 01:46:23.899
not only here in the United States, but in Bethels around the world.

01:46:23.899 --> 01:46:26.899
What do you think is left to be revealed?

01:46:26.899 --> 01:46:31.899
Part 2 of the annual meeting has more exciting announcements

01:46:31.899 --> 01:46:34.899
and we'll watch it in next month's broadcast.

01:46:35.899 --> 01:46:39.899
Before we conclude, let's travel to Niger.

01:46:39.899 --> 01:46:44.899
Niger stretches from the fertile deltas of the Niger River

01:46:44.899 --> 01:46:47.899
to the Grand Sahara Desert.

01:46:47.899 --> 01:46:51.899
With such drastic differences between locations,

01:46:51.899 --> 01:46:55.899
publishers need to use a variety of preaching methods.

01:46:55.899 --> 01:47:01.899
In the capital city of Niamay, they reach commuters walking the busy streets.

01:47:01.899 --> 01:47:05.899
In remote desert cities, they seek out merchants

01:47:05.899 --> 01:47:11.899
and way through fertile riverbeds to find farmers tending their crops and patties.

01:47:11.899 --> 01:47:17.899
While in the desert, many publishers preach wearing a combined turbine in veil

01:47:17.899 --> 01:47:20.899
which protects them from the windblown sand.

01:47:20.899 --> 01:47:23.899
Tough conditions are made bearable

01:47:23.899 --> 01:47:27.899
because the Nigerian people are so hospitable.

01:47:27.899 --> 01:47:31.899
There's a common phrase in the local language, Hausa,

01:47:31.899 --> 01:47:33.899
that translates to,

01:47:33.899 --> 01:47:36.899
your guest is your king.

01:47:36.899 --> 01:47:41.899
Many will stop and listen to what our brothers show them from the Bible.

01:47:41.899 --> 01:47:45.899
Both young and old in Niger counted a privilege

01:47:45.899 --> 01:47:49.899
to announce God's kingdom and to enjoy spiritual food.

01:47:49.899 --> 01:47:55.899
It's a pleasure to share with you all the love and greetings of our dear brothers

01:47:55.899 --> 01:48:02.899
from the Bobiella, Harobandezarma, and the Aralita congregations.

01:48:02.899 --> 01:48:06.899
From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

01:48:06.899 --> 01:48:09.899
this is JW Broadcasting.
