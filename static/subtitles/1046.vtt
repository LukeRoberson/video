00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.620
put up a hard fight for the faith.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.619
Now, those are the words of Jude, the half-brother of Jesus,

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:12.619
and it's important to consider them in their context.

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:13.619
So let's do that.

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:16.620
Please turn to Jude, verse 3,

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.620
and then even Bibles open because we're going to consider another verse in Jude.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.620
And this will help us to get the point that Jude was making.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:33.299
Jude, verse 3, he says, beloved ones.

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:39.299
Although I was making every effort to write you about the salvation we hold in common,

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:48.299
I found it necessary to write you to urge you to put up a hard fight for the faith.

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:54.299
Now, Jude himself had been putting up a hard fight for the faith.

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:58.299
Consider this, just three years earlier,

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:05.299
his own flesh-late brother James was stone to death at the order of high priest Ananias.

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.299
That was an open attack on God's people,

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.299
and it must have been very painful to Jude and to others.

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.299
And here's something interesting.

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:22.299
Jude is not warning his brothers about high priest Ananias or about persecution.

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.299
He has something else in mind, a different type of attack,

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.299
and this is a sneaky one. Let's look at verse 4,

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.299
and we'll see why he wrote his letter.

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.299
Notice the very first words.

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:40.299
My reason is, so this is what I have in mind when I'm writing you brothers.

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.299
My reason is that certain men have slipped in among you

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.299
who were long ago appointed to this judgment by the Scriptures.

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.299
So Jude is talking about false brothers

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.299
who are presenting a real danger to the congregations in some ways,

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.299
a greater danger than outright persecution.

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.299
And did you notice what Jude said about those false brothers?

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.300
They had slipped in. They were sneaky.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.300
That was true back then, and it's true today, as we'll see.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.300
And brothers, this is a very serious matter that we're considering today.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.300
Think of this.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.300
Was the Christian congregation brought down by persecution in the second and third centuries?

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:35.300
It wasn't. It was brought down by false brothers, apostate teachings.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.300
And so the devil can use an outright attack.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:45.300
He can use persecution to try to better the structure of the Christian congregation,

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.300
but sometimes he uses rot from within.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.300
A subtle means to attack us.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.300
But whatever method he uses, we have to fight.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.300
Our faith is involved, and our faith is worth fighting for.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.300
It's a gift from Jehovah.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.300
We have to hold onto it. It's a product of his Holy Spirit,

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.300
so we have to put up a hard fight for our faith.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.300
So in this talk, we're not going to discuss persecution.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.300
We're going to discuss two of the subtle means Satan uses to weaken our faith.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:25.300
Apostasy and negative reports about Jehovah's Witnesses in the media.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.300
So first, let's talk about apostasy.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.300
And we'll call it spiritual poison.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.300
Now think about poison.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.300
What's the best way to avoid being poisoned?

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.300
Well, we have to recognize poison when we see it, and then avoid it.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:49.300
And the same principle applies to teachings that could destroy our faith.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.300
And that's not always easy.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.300
Now, not many of our brothers and sisters would deliberately get involved with apostates,

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.300
but it could happen without realizing it.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:06.300
We receive letters at times from brothers and sisters who were troubled by something they saw on a webpage.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.300
An accusation, a rumor about the society or about the organization,

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:17.300
and the problem is they had no idea that apostates were behind it.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:23.300
It's tricky because the apostates don't advertise you are now on an apostate webpage.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.300
They often pose as sincere witnesses who just have questions or concerns.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.300
And some who aren't really apostates can cause just as much trouble as the apostates do

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.300
by their negative talk and criticism.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.300
Brothers, we need to be on the alert.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.300
This is serious.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:50.300
Suppose that out of curiosity, you get into a discussion forum with individuals who claim to meet your home as witnesses.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.300
Now, maybe they are, maybe they are, you don't know, you've never met them.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.300
And someone starts asking questions.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.300
What did you think of last month's broadcast? Did you really find it encouraging?

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.300
Or do you think the brothers who write watched our articles are living in the real world?

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.300
I wonder if they realize just how hard it is out here.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.300
And then a few others join in with their own negative comments.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:21.300
Now, you don't know whether these individuals are apostates or just brothers and sisters who were in serious spiritual trouble.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.300
But does it matter? How does it make you feel?

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.300
When you leave the forum, do you feel upbuilt?

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.300
Determined to expand your ministry?

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:41.300
More convinced than ever that Jehovah has an organization that you love and that you're delighted to be a part of you feel honored to be a part of that organization.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.300
Or does the experience leave you sad?

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.300
Uneasy, uncomfortable.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:55.670
Now, someone might say, I need to get involved in that forum so I can help those people.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.670
They shouldn't be together.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.670
Even if they aren't apostates, they're not good for one another.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:11.670
Staying in that forum to help someone is like holding his hand while he drinks poison and then having some yourself so he doesn't have to drink alone.

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.670
We need to follow the advice recorded at Romans 16 and verse 17.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:25.670
Now, think of this imaginary forum that we just described in the light of Romans 16 and verse 17.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:30.670
Remember, there's all kinds of negative top flying around in this forum.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.670
You don't know who's behind it.

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.670
And here's what it says in Romans 16 verse 17.

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:54.670
Now, I urge you, brothers, to keep your eye on those who create divisions and causes for stumbling, contrary to the teaching that you have learned and avoid them.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.670
Now, think about that forum.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.670
Does it create divisions?

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:01.670
Yes.

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.670
Is it a cause for stumbling?

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:05.670
Could be.

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.670
Is it contrary to what we have learned?

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.670
Do we even have to answer that question?

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:15.670
Now, whether it's intended or not, the effect will be to weaken our faith.

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:16.670
So what do we do?

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.670
What does Paul tell us to do here at the end of verse 17?

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:21.670
He says, avoid them.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:30.139
No, I'd like to say a kind word to some who may be involved in discussion forums.

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:34.139
You may like to use this medium to blow off steam, so to speak.

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:42.139
Maybe there are little things in the congregation that are happening that you wonder about or decisions the elders have made that you wonder about.

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:48.139
And so you get involved in the forum and you blow off steam and after that you feel better.

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:51.139
But what about others in the forum?

00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:52.139
How do they feel?

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:59.139
Wouldn't you feel awful if negative comments you made were responsible for someone leaving the truth?

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:07.139
I know you wouldn't want that to happen, so please, please be careful about what you say.

00:08:07.139 --> 00:08:12.139
Now, another person might say, well, I can see where those warnings about apostates apply to so-and-so.

00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:14.139
He's weak, but don't worry about me.

00:08:14.139 --> 00:08:18.139
I'm spiritually strong. I can handle it.

00:08:18.139 --> 00:08:25.139
That's like a weightlifter, thinking that he can drink a vile of poison and it won't hurt him because he's so big and strong.

00:08:25.139 --> 00:08:34.139
We are not so strong, so spiritual, so intelligent, that we cannot be affected by the poison of apostate ideas.

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:42.519
Now, when might we feel pressured to read something that the apostates have written?

00:08:42.519 --> 00:08:44.519
Consider this scenario.

00:08:45.519 --> 00:08:51.519
The unbelieving husband of your Bible student sends his wife a link to an apostate web page and says,

00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:55.519
here, you better look at this and see what you're getting into.

00:08:55.519 --> 00:09:00.519
While your student is concerned, she wants you to take a look and tell her what you think.

00:09:00.519 --> 00:09:02.519
Well, that's not an option.

00:09:02.519 --> 00:09:05.519
Paul says, avoid them.

00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:12.519
That doesn't mean reading a apostate literature or searching social media to see what they're saying about us.

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:14.519
So what do you say to your student?

00:09:14.519 --> 00:09:18.960
You might say something like this.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.960
I can imagine that this is very upsetting for you.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.960
And you certainly do need to know what you're getting into.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.960
I have a suggestion. We have nothing to hide.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.960
When you're at the meetings, listen carefully to what the brothers are saying.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.960
Watch how we interact with one another.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.960
That note of how the organization is financed.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.960
Get to know the elders, their wives.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.960
Introduce yourself to the circuit overseer and his wife when they come.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.960
Visit world headquarters of the branch.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.960
I'll come with you. I'll help you.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.960
And I want you to get really acquainted with the organization.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:59.960
And if you do, I'm sure you'll soon realize that what the people are saying about us isn't true.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.960
Well, maybe you can think of a better answer, but you get the idea.

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:12.370
Just a few drops of poison in a drink are enough to cause serious harm.

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:16.370
At a post, it's often mixed a few truths with lies.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:20.370
I remember Ella Fass, one of Job's false comforters.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.370
Some of what he said was true.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:29.120
Let's turn to Job chapter 5 and verse 13.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:33.120
Job chapter 5, I'll give you a moment, and verse 13.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:39.490
See if what I read sounds familiar.

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:47.490
He catches the wise in their own cunning, so that the plans of the shrewd are thwarted.

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:51.490
He catches the wise in their own coming, cunning.

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:53.490
Does that sound familiar?

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:54.490
Oh, yes.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:58.490
The Apostle Paul said the very same thing at first French in 319.

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:05.490
In fact, in the marginal reference that we see in the little A in the middle there, first Corinthians 319,

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:10.490
Paul may even have been quoting Ella Fass.

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:12.490
So, that was a truth.

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:17.490
But how did Jehovah feel about Ella Fass' argument overall?

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:24.490
Let's turn to Job 42 for 7, and see how Jehovah felt about it.

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:27.490
Job 42 and verse 7.

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:35.570
After Jehovah had spoken these words to Job, Jehovah said to Ella Fass the Timonite,

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:45.570
My anger burns against you and your true companions, for you have not spoken the truth about me as my servant Job has.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:54.570
A few grains of truth were mixed in with falsehoods, and at least some of what Ella Fass said was inspired by the demons.

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.570
How do we know that?

00:11:56.570 --> 00:12:05.480
He had met in it, known as Job 4, verses 15 through 17.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.480
I'll give you a moment. This is interesting.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.480
Job 4, 15 to 17.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:16.750
Ella Fass says, A spirit passed over my face.

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:21.750
The hair of my flesh bristled. It then stood still.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:26.750
But I did not recognize its appearance. Let's stop there for a second.

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:32.750
I did not recognize its appearance, so he didn't know whom he was talking to,

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:38.750
just like someone in a discussion forum may not know whom he is talking to.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:45.750
Let's continue. He says, A form was in front of my eyes. There was a calm.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:56.059
And then I heard a voice, kind of mortal man be more righteous than God, kind of man be cleaner than his own maker.

00:12:56.059 --> 00:13:02.059
Does it surprise you that a demon will get involved in the debate between Job and the false comforters?

00:13:02.059 --> 00:13:07.059
It shouldn't. This was no small debate. He was a big issue.

00:13:07.059 --> 00:13:14.059
Satan had challenged Jehovah in the presence of all the angels that no man would keep his integrity under test.

00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:20.059
That demon was using Ella Fass to demoralize Job and weaken his faith.

00:13:20.059 --> 00:13:25.059
This was something that Job had to fight for and Job fought back.

00:13:25.059 --> 00:13:30.860
Apostates are more active in some places than they are in others.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:38.860
So if there's a lot of apostate activity in your area, people in the territory may be listening and they may challenge you when you meet them in the ministry.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.860
So how should you handle it?

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:47.860
Don't try to argue with the apostates. Don't read their comments.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:54.860
Ask the elders or other experienced publishers for suggestions on how to answer the householders.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:59.860
Well, how poisonous are apostate teachings?

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.860
Let's find out as we watch the following video.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:12.169
When I was in my 40s, I was divorced. I had three younger kids at home.

00:14:12.169 --> 00:14:18.169
I was working three jobs and I had drifted away from the congregation.

00:14:18.169 --> 00:14:30.169
I had an acquaintance who was telling me that I was an occult and that I needed to look at some information that he had.

00:14:30.169 --> 00:14:38.169
When I was about 30 years old, a fellow employee saw that I was one of Job's witnesses and was trying to access JW.org.

00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:45.169
He told me about someone he knew in another country who could prove to me that Job's witnesses didn't have the truth.

00:14:45.169 --> 00:14:52.169
That made me curious. And little by little, I was persuaded to look at apostate material.

00:14:52.169 --> 00:14:59.169
So I was born and raised in the truth, chose to dedicate myself to Jehovah at the age of 16.

00:14:59.169 --> 00:15:09.169
But I began to associate with people who had either formerly been associated with the truth or were very loosely associated with Jehovah in his organization.

00:15:09.169 --> 00:15:14.169
And that's really where the apostasy began to take root.

00:15:14.169 --> 00:15:26.169
As I was reading this literature, I saw through it to an extent. But when you're drifting away, you're looking for a reason not to believe.

00:15:26.169 --> 00:15:35.169
I began to feed my mind with different philosophies, different ideas, even studied different religions.

00:15:35.169 --> 00:15:44.169
And I told myself that I was doing that academically, but it started to influence the way that I thought and felt about things.

00:15:44.169 --> 00:15:50.169
Eventually, the elders reached out to me. I was very combative with those brothers.

00:15:50.169 --> 00:15:58.169
I even made the accusation that Noah's Ark was a fairy tale, that that was part of mythology.

00:15:58.169 --> 00:16:04.169
Those apostate doubts that I was reading kept going deeper and deeper into my heart.

00:16:04.169 --> 00:16:11.169
I stopped reading the publications. I stopped going to the meetings. And as a result, my spiritual routine was dead.

00:16:11.169 --> 00:16:22.169
So I thought I'd try to find truth elsewhere. And I looked for something out there that was in accord with what I knew the Bible taught. But I couldn't find anything.

00:16:22.169 --> 00:16:30.169
Well, one Sunday morning, I rode by the Kingdom Hall, and I said to myself, oh, they're all in there waiting for Armageddon.

00:16:30.169 --> 00:16:39.169
Immediately, when I thought that thought, I said to myself, well, at least they feel good about themselves. How do you feel?

00:16:39.169 --> 00:16:43.169
And the answer was, I felt terrible.

00:16:43.169 --> 00:17:00.169
Eventually, skillful use of the scriptures and just reasoning with me, the elders got me to realize that I had been carried off, or that I had been taken captive by human philosophy, by the deceptions and this empty reasoning of men.

00:17:00.169 --> 00:17:12.170
I actually said a prayer. I supplicated Jehovah, that he would really show me the way to the truth. And he took away this feeling of emptiness, spiritually speaking.

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:21.170
I realized that relationship with Jehovah, that's our most precious possession. I had to get back.

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:30.170
I started to study the Bible with sincerity. I wanted it to affect my mind and my heart. And I wanted it to affect change in my behavior.

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:39.170
Now, as I did that, I felt Jehovah blessing those efforts. He began to help me to rebuild that relationship with him.

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:47.170
So I began to use Jehovah's name. Speaking about Jehovah became a wonderful joy and a great pleasure to me.

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:56.170
And the result was that my ministry was very productive. And it's an amazing joy to be able to help someone come to love Jehovah.

00:17:56.170 --> 00:18:02.170
I was just so happy to be back under Jehovah's wings and have that peace of mind.

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:10.170
How loving Jehovah is, he wants to help us. And what better help could we have? He's the best in the universe.

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:18.170
Now, let's consider the second challenge we face. Negative reports about Jehovah's witnesses in the media.

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:31.170
And here's a good principle to follow. Proverbs 14 and verse 15. We'll give you a moment. Proverbs 14 and verse 15.

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:42.670
It says, the naive person believes every word, but the shrewd one ponders each step.

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:48.920
Some people believe everything they read in the newspaper or see on TV.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:55.920
To you should you consider this. Now you're working from door to door.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:00.920
And you meet a householder who says, you and Jehovah's witnesses are terrible people.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:04.920
You let your children die. You don't accept medical treatment.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.920
Well, you asked the householder, do you know any of Jehovah's witnesses personally?

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:16.920
No. Then where did you get the idea that we let our children die? And don't accept medical treatment?

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:22.920
The householder says, I have it on good authority. I read it in the newspaper.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:27.920
Well, if it's in the newspaper, it must be true, right?

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:32.920
Not necessarily. Remember this. Reporters have a deadline to meet.

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:37.920
And a reporter may not have the time or the inclination to check the facts.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:43.920
Or the reporter may have written a balance article, but then the editor changes it.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:49.920
Maybe the editor doesn't like Jehovah's witnesses or he's been misinformed about us.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.920
Now it's bad enough if people in the world believe everything they read in the newspaper.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:59.920
But brothers, let's not be among them. Let's not be naive.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.920
Let's consider things carefully.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:08.920
Similarly, sometimes there's a TV program about Jehovah's witnesses.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:12.920
Now a few of these programs are balanced and fair.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.920
Many, or I dare say most, are not.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:21.920
And when they're not, you'll often find that the producers started out with a negative view of Jehovah's witnesses

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:25.920
and then they looked for information to support their prejudice.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:29.920
So whom did they turn to? Apostates and the clergy.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.920
From them, they got suggestions for people to interview.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.920
And we know what those people would say.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:41.920
At the very last minute, they may ask the brothers for comment just to give an appearance of fairness,

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.920
but the program wasn't designed to be fair.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:50.920
It was designed to be unfair. It was slanted against Jehovah's witnesses.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.920
Now let's be clear.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.920
Some news organizations are very conscientious about their reporting

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.920
and they want to present both sides of an issue.

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:05.920
And when Jehovah's witnesses are concerned, they do so at their cost.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:10.920
If a newspaper publishes anything positive about us, the churches will push back.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.920
Our parishioners are upset. They subscribe to your newspaper

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:17.920
and they don't like reading favorable things about Jehovah's witnesses.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.920
The message, if it ever happens again,

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:24.920
they're going to lose subscribers.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:32.920
Now this matter of Jehovah's people being the subject of malicious reports isn't new.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:36.920
Think about the days of Queen Esther.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:40.920
Wicked Heyman brings a bad report to King of Hazuerus.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:45.920
The Jews don't obey our laws. They're a danger to society.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:48.920
Does a Hazuerus check the facts?

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.920
Does he demand proof?

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.920
No. A Hazuerus is naive.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:58.920
He allows himself to be taken in by Heyman.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.920
Well, there are a lot of modern day Heymans today

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.920
and they use similar tactics.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:08.920
As a result, some government officials are taken in.

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:12.920
They believe the slanderous accusations of the apostates.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.920
Now if they just take the time to check the facts,

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:20.920
they'd see that they're being lied to, but they don't check the facts.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:26.920
Now again, it's bad enough, brothers, when government officials are taken in by false reports,

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:32.160
don't you be taken in?

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:37.160
Have you ever heard the expression trial by a media?

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:40.160
It works like this. Someone's charged with a crime.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.160
And the case is widely publicized in the media.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.160
And the media present the case in such a way

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:50.160
that everyone who hears about it thinks the man is guilty.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:54.160
Of course, to avoid a lawsuit for slander or liable,

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.160
these media reports are very carefully worded.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.160
And we need to understand what the wording means.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.160
Here's a good principle to keep in mind.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:07.109
Job, chapter 12, and verse 11.

00:23:07.109 --> 00:23:12.109
It's amazing how many principles we can draw from the book of Job for this talk.

00:23:12.109 --> 00:23:16.109
Job, chapter 12, and verse 11.

00:23:16.109 --> 00:23:18.109
This is Job speaking.

00:23:18.109 --> 00:23:26.109
And he says, does not the ear test out words as the tongue tastes food?

00:23:26.109 --> 00:23:30.109
Does not the ear test out words?

00:23:30.109 --> 00:23:32.109
What does that mean?

00:23:32.109 --> 00:23:37.109
Does it mean that if we learn that apostates are going to be featured on a TV program,

00:23:37.109 --> 00:23:40.109
we should watch it to see if what they say is true?

00:23:40.109 --> 00:23:42.109
No.

00:23:42.109 --> 00:23:46.109
It basically means to consider the source of the words.

00:23:46.109 --> 00:23:50.109
If they are the words of apostates, why would we believe them?

00:23:50.109 --> 00:23:52.109
Now, think of it this way.

00:23:52.109 --> 00:23:56.109
You have a model on your shelf that's marked poison.

00:23:56.109 --> 00:23:58.109
Do you need to open it up?

00:23:58.109 --> 00:24:01.109
Take a swing to see if it really is poison?

00:24:01.109 --> 00:24:04.109
Believe what the label says.

00:24:04.109 --> 00:24:06.109
Now, for the purpose of this discussion,

00:24:06.109 --> 00:24:09.109
let's consider another way we can test out words.

00:24:09.109 --> 00:24:13.109
And that is to pay attention to what the words mean.

00:24:13.109 --> 00:24:21.109
Remember, we talked about media reports and how these are very often carefully worded to avoid a lawsuit.

00:24:21.109 --> 00:24:28.109
So suppose a report indicates that someone has been charged with a crime or that he's being investigated.

00:24:28.109 --> 00:24:30.109
All right, you have two words.

00:24:30.109 --> 00:24:33.109
Charged and investigated.

00:24:33.109 --> 00:24:36.109
It doesn't mean he's guilty.

00:24:36.109 --> 00:24:40.109
Or suppose that someone is convicted and put in jail.

00:24:40.109 --> 00:24:43.109
Well, that would apply to our young brothers in Korea, wouldn't it?

00:24:43.109 --> 00:24:45.109
They were convicted and jailed.

00:24:45.109 --> 00:24:47.109
And what was their crime?

00:24:47.109 --> 00:24:50.109
They refused to kill someone?

00:24:50.109 --> 00:24:53.109
Did they do anything wrong?

00:24:53.109 --> 00:24:58.109
Or someone is found guilty by men as Jesus was.

00:24:58.109 --> 00:25:03.109
It doesn't mean that he's guilty in the sight of God.

00:25:03.109 --> 00:25:07.109
So brothers, we really have to think about these things.

00:25:07.109 --> 00:25:13.109
We may read that a person or an organization was sued and then settled out of court.

00:25:13.109 --> 00:25:17.109
Does settling out of court mean that they were guilty?

00:25:17.109 --> 00:25:19.109
Not necessarily.

00:25:19.109 --> 00:25:24.109
Now, in this country and others, court cases are often handled by a jury.

00:25:24.109 --> 00:25:26.109
Now, who are on the jury?

00:25:26.109 --> 00:25:28.109
Ordinary citizens with no legal training.

00:25:28.109 --> 00:25:30.109
But not only that.

00:25:30.109 --> 00:25:34.109
These ordinary citizens don't always have access to all the facts.

00:25:34.109 --> 00:25:39.109
Because the judge and lawyers decide which facts will be shared with the jury.

00:25:39.109 --> 00:25:44.109
So it's unlikely that the whole truth will ever come out in court.

00:25:44.109 --> 00:25:50.109
Actually, neither side probably wants the whole truth to come out in court.

00:25:50.109 --> 00:25:56.109
Now, sometimes attorneys deliberately withhold information that would be prejudicial to their clients.

00:25:56.109 --> 00:26:00.109
And in addition, centuries have prejudices like everyone else,

00:26:00.109 --> 00:26:05.109
and some of them just can't set their prejudices aside.

00:26:05.109 --> 00:26:08.109
I'll tell you an actual experience.

00:26:08.109 --> 00:26:12.109
Some time ago, when lawyer told me about a case he had,

00:26:12.109 --> 00:26:16.109
that was a case of medical malpractice by a doctor.

00:26:16.109 --> 00:26:18.109
There was a jury.

00:26:18.109 --> 00:26:22.109
At that trial, their doctor was clearly shown to be in the room.

00:26:22.109 --> 00:26:26.109
But the jury didn't give the patient a penny.

00:26:26.109 --> 00:26:32.579
The lawyer was confused, so after the trial, he approached two of the jurors and asked,

00:26:32.579 --> 00:26:36.579
if you don't mind, tell me which part of the testimony you didn't believe.

00:26:36.579 --> 00:26:39.579
The jurors replied, oh, we didn't get that far.

00:26:39.579 --> 00:26:44.579
The doctor was cute, and we didn't want him to have to pay anything.

00:26:44.579 --> 00:26:49.579
With deep thinkers like that, no wonder many lawyers tried to settle their cases

00:26:49.579 --> 00:26:51.579
rather than bring them to a jury.

00:26:51.579 --> 00:26:57.119
But someone will say, no, I don't believe in settling out of court.

00:26:57.119 --> 00:26:59.119
I believe in justice and truth.

00:26:59.119 --> 00:27:06.119
So that brings up the question, is it wrong to settle a matter before it goes to trial?

00:27:06.119 --> 00:27:08.119
Or is it scriptural?

00:27:08.119 --> 00:27:10.119
Let's let Jesus answer that question.

00:27:10.119 --> 00:27:15.119
Turn to Matthew chapter 5, verses 25 and 26.

00:27:15.119 --> 00:27:24.220
Interesting that Jesus should mention this.

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:28.220
With all the important things that Jesus taught.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:33.220
Matthew chapter 5, verses 25 and 26.

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:42.220
Be quick to settle matters with your legal opponent while you are with him on the way there.

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:46.220
So that somehow the opponent may not turn you over to the judge,

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:50.220
and the judge to the court attendant, and you get thrown into prison.

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:55.220
I say to you for a fact, you will certainly not come out of there

00:27:55.220 --> 00:28:00.750
until you have paid over your last small coin.

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:02.750
Now this is interesting.

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:04.750
Think about the mosaic law.

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:09.750
Was there any provision in the mosaic law to throw someone in jail if he couldn't pay a debt?

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.750
That wasn't the way.

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:13.750
If he couldn't pay, he'd have to work it off.

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:16.750
Or a family member would have to work it off.

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:20.750
So when Jesus talks about prison and a judge,

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:24.750
he's obviously referring to what a Gentile judge would do.

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:27.750
And he couldn't necessarily expect justice from him.

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:30.750
Why might he rule against our brother?

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:34.750
Well, maybe he got paid under the table or the other party.

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:41.750
Or maybe he was prejudiced against the race or the religion of the other party.

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:47.750
Now notice, Jesus didn't say that the man should settle only if he was guilty.

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:50.750
So brothers, let's not mean our leave.

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:53.750
Don't believe everything you read.

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:57.750
Just because an article is called a news report doesn't make it true.

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:01.750
And an editorial that someone's opinion, that someone may be wrong.

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:09.750
And TV producers may have their own agenda, prejudice, and viewpoint.

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:15.750
So what do we say in revision and conclusion?

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:19.750
Our faith is under attack.

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:21.750
And we have to fight.

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:24.750
And Jehovah gives us what we need to fight with.

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:27.750
One of the things he gives us, good associations.

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:30.750
Satan will try to lure us away from good associations.

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:36.750
He'll try to weaken our faith by getting us involved in bad association without our knowing.

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:40.750
But Jehovah provides good association in the congregation.

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:43.750
These are people we know. These are people we love.

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:47.750
These are people who have our best interests at heart.

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:59.150
Keep in mind the principle we find at Proverbs 13 and verse 20.

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:03.150
The one walking with the wise will become wise.

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:08.150
But the one who has dealings with the stupid will fare badly.

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:11.150
You know the members of your congregation.

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:13.150
You know that they are wise.

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:16.150
You know that they have your best interests at heart.

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:21.150
But if you get involved in a forum, you might not know whether you're walking with wise persons or not.

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:23.150
At least not at first.

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:25.150
So be careful.

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:31.150
If the conversation turns negative, get out.

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:36.150
Satan is behind the twisted teachings of apostates.

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:38.150
He's the father of the lie.

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:43.150
And those who lie are doing exactly what their father does.

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:46.150
The apostates have nothing to offer us, brothers.

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:52.150
All they have to offer is hate. All they have is to offer is criticism and negative talk.

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:57.150
But oh, how upbuilt we feel when we're with those who love Jehovah.

00:30:57.150 --> 00:31:02.150
So Jehovah provides us with good, wholesome associations.

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:05.150
He also provides us with his word of truth.

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:09.150
And an accurate knowledge of the truth is the best defense against apostasy.

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:12.150
Read the Bible every day and meditate on it.

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:13.150
Pay attention to the words.

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:15.150
Pay attention to what they mean.

00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:20.150
Be like the Bereans, referred to at Acts chapter 17.

00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:23.150
And verses 10 and 11.

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:24.150
Let's read that.

00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:29.150
Acts chapter 17, verses 10 and 11.

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:35.779
Immediately by night, the brothers sent both Paul and Silas to Berea.

00:31:36.779 --> 00:31:39.779
On arriving, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.

00:31:39.779 --> 00:31:43.779
Now, these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica.

00:31:43.779 --> 00:31:47.779
For they accepted the word with the greatest eagerness of mind.

00:31:47.779 --> 00:31:50.779
Carefully examining the scriptures daily.

00:31:50.779 --> 00:31:54.779
Carefully examining the scriptures daily.

00:31:54.779 --> 00:31:58.779
To see whether these things were so.

00:31:58.779 --> 00:32:03.779
Now, Paul compares the Bereans with the Thessalonians.

00:32:03.779 --> 00:32:07.779
They didn't have YouTube in those days.

00:32:07.779 --> 00:32:14.779
But at one point, the Thessalonians apparently heard a rumor that the day of Jehovah had arrived.

00:32:14.779 --> 00:32:16.779
Who circulated the rumor?

00:32:16.779 --> 00:32:17.779
An apostate?

00:32:17.779 --> 00:32:18.779
Maybe.

00:32:18.779 --> 00:32:23.779
But maybe it was just someone who had heard the rumor and passed it on without checking it out.

00:32:23.779 --> 00:32:25.779
Have you ever done that?

00:32:25.779 --> 00:32:28.779
Passed on a report without checking the facts?

00:32:29.779 --> 00:32:34.779
I think all of us have to admit that we've been guilty of that at one time or another.

00:32:34.779 --> 00:32:37.779
But now, how did the Thessalonians react?

00:32:37.779 --> 00:32:39.779
They were alarmed.

00:32:39.779 --> 00:32:42.779
They were quickly shaken from their reason.

00:32:42.779 --> 00:32:44.779
We mustn't let that happen to us.

00:32:44.779 --> 00:32:47.779
When you hear something, check it out.

00:32:47.779 --> 00:32:48.779
Don't just circulate it.

00:32:48.779 --> 00:32:49.779
Don't just believe it.

00:32:49.779 --> 00:32:51.779
Check it out.

00:32:51.779 --> 00:32:53.779
Colossians 2, 6 and 7.

00:32:53.779 --> 00:32:56.779
The last scripture we'll read during this talk.

00:32:56.779 --> 00:33:02.779
Here Paul explains how we can avoid being quickly shaken from our reason.

00:33:02.779 --> 00:33:04.779
Let's read this final scripture.

00:33:04.779 --> 00:33:08.779
Colossians chapter 2, verses 6 and 7.

00:33:10.259 --> 00:33:15.259
Therefore, just as you have accepted Christ Jesus the Lord,

00:33:15.259 --> 00:33:18.259
go on walking in union with Him.

00:33:18.259 --> 00:33:21.259
You do that and you'll be walking with a wise one, certainly.

00:33:21.259 --> 00:33:26.259
Being rooted and built up in Him and then notices

00:33:26.259 --> 00:33:32.259
and being stabilized in the faith just as you were taught.

00:33:32.259 --> 00:33:34.259
If we're stabilized in the faith,

00:33:34.259 --> 00:33:42.109
we won't be quickly shaken by unfounded accusations by apostates or the media.

00:33:42.109 --> 00:33:47.109
False rumors are often spread during wartime.

00:33:47.109 --> 00:33:50.109
Brothers, this is war.

00:33:50.109 --> 00:33:53.109
We need to put up a hard fight for the faith

00:33:53.109 --> 00:33:55.109
as if our life depended on it.

00:33:55.109 --> 00:33:57.109
Because it does.
