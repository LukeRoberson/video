00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:06.490
Have you ever wondered if your best would ever be good enough?

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.310
Now because of the pressure from the world around us and our own imperfection,

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:15.169
many of us are just

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:17.170
too hard on ourselves.

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:19.809
Maybe even demanding perfection of ourselves.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:30.329
One sister explained her feelings this way. She says, no matter how much I love Jehovah or how much effort I put forth to serve him,

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:34.490
I always feel that it is not good enough.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.850
Maybe we can relate to how she feels at times.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.530
Unreasonable expectations can zap us of our joy,

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.969
strangle our joy, and sometimes the joy of those around us.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.130
But aren't we glad that Jehovah's different?

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:56.729
Though he is perfect, he's not a perfectionist.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:04.890
It's interesting that there's so many reasons that Jehovah has to be joyful,

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.049
and one of those is because he's so reasonable.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.569
So the question is how does he do it?

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.049
How does Jehovah maintain this balance and find joy in his work,

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.849
and also in the work that others do?

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.650
To answer those questions, we're going to focus in on one of Jehovah's most beautiful words.

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:28.489
Planet Earth.

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.650
Now, when Jehovah created the Earth, or was creating the Earth, it was so beautiful and so unique

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:40.730
that the angels broke out in applause during its formation.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.530
And then at some point, Jehovah expressed the words found at Genesis chapter 1.

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.010
Open your Bibles there with me, please, Genesis chapter 1.

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:56.010
And we'll read the first sentence of verse 31.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.180
Genesis 1 and verse 31.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.819
It says, after that, God saw everything He had made.

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:12.379
And look, it was very good.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.419
Now, this expression very good.

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:18.460
It's the first time that it's used in the creation account.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.180
What does it mean?

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.180
Well, the inside book under the article Perfection has a very nice explanation,

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.539
and to sum it all up, it basically means that the Earth was perfect.

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:35.979
Now, does that mean that the Earth was completely finished yet?

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:38.139
No.

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.300
We know that the Earth was beautiful, but it was still a large and mostly

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.460
uncultivated wilderness.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.620
Jehovah said to Adam and Eve that they've got to subdue the Earth so that they could extend

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.340
the boundaries of the Garden of Eden to the whole planet.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.819
So then the question is, how could it be said that the Earth was perfect

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.900
if Jehovah's purpose for the Earth was not yet complete?

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:14.500
Well, it's interesting what the same inside book article goes on to say about all of Jehovah's

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.060
creation.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:23.300
It says perfection of any other person or thing other than Jehovah himself, of course,

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:27.460
is relative, not absolute.

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:33.139
So the Earth was perfect in a relative sense.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:40.259
It met Jehovah's perfect standards at that moment even though there was still much to do.

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:43.939
Now, here's our first lesson.

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:48.580
The first thing we can learn from Jehovah here, he is so reasonable.

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:54.180
He doesn't have to wait for every detail of something that he's doing to be finished

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.860
before he can find joy in what he's doing.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:05.139
He can be content with his work even when his work is still a work in progress.

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.990
Now, what do you think Jehovah wants for you and me?

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.229
Well, he wants us to enjoy our work the same way that he enjoys his.

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:17.670
But we might say, well, that's fine, but Jehovah's work is perfect.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.750
My work is not, but doesn't the principle still apply?

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.750
I think about it.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.750
Maybe we've come a long way in improving on a quality like patience.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.949
And we've done so much and we're so different from the person that we were before.

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:41.110
And then all of a sudden, the situation comes up that puts a real test,

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.189
that puts a test to our patients.

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:46.790
And we realize how much we still have to work on.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.069
Or maybe you're sitting here as some of you are,

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:55.589
as Gilead students, soon to be graduates.

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:59.350
You've been studying a lot for five months and you're wondering,

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.350
how in the world am I going to ever be able to apply all the things that I learned

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.589
that Gilead, I just don't measure up.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.779
Don't persecute yourself by focusing on what has not been done yet.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:20.740
The reality is you have done so much already and you've done it because you love Jehovah.

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:23.860
He loves you for that. We love you for that.

00:05:25.899 --> 00:05:26.779
So what's the point?

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.740
The point is imitate Jehovah's reasonableness

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.740
by learning to find joy in what has been done,

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:41.819
to find joy in the work that is still a work in progress.

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:47.980
Now, Jehovah is also able to find joy in the work that others do.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.100
And we can see that also in the creation of Planet Earth.

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:59.579
We remember that in Genesis 1 verse 26, Jehovah introduces his son and master worker Jesus.

00:05:59.579 --> 00:06:05.420
So Jesus was there when Jehovah said, very good.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:14.379
Jehovah was saying, I appreciate your contribution to the making of the earth,

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:17.420
even though there's still much to do.

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:23.259
Wow, can you imagine how Jesus would have felt hearing Jehovah say very good?

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:31.019
Let's imagine by reading one verse and we'll link these two verses, Genesis 1, 31,

00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:34.139
to Proverbs chapter 8 and verse 30.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:40.060
Remember that Proverbs chapter 8, much of it is talking about Jesus' prehuman existence

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:46.220
when he's helping Jehovah make all things. Now, imagine the day that Jehovah says very good

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:55.990
in verse 30. Proverbs chapter 8 and verse 30. It says, then I, Jesus,

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:05.670
was beside him, Jehovah, as a master worker. I was the one he was especially fond of day by day.

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:15.189
I rejoiced before him all the time. So what's Jesus saying? He felt appreciated by Jehovah.

00:07:16.709 --> 00:07:22.949
In fact, it made him so happy. He rejoiced, it says, this word rejoiced in the original Hebrew,

00:07:22.949 --> 00:07:30.550
includes the idea of laughing, celebrating, and having a good time. So Jesus absolutely

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:37.589
loved working with Jehovah because he felt appreciated so much so that he continued to give Jehovah his

00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:45.829
best, even under the most difficult of circumstances. So again, what's the lesson we can learn from Jehovah?

00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:53.750
Well, he's reasonable in what he expects from others. He doesn't just get hung up on all the things

00:07:53.750 --> 00:08:00.149
that haven't been done yet. He focuses primarily on what has been done well, and he expresses

00:08:00.149 --> 00:08:07.699
appreciation for that. Have you ever delegated an assignment to someone, maybe at Bethel?

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:15.980
And though much has been done, there's still a lot to do, or bringing it to the congregation.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:21.740
There's that brother or sister that's the single parent that has just emptied themselves to try

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:28.060
to help their child to come and to love Jehovah. And there's such a good example,

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:37.500
but their child just doesn't want it. He doesn't want the truth. You see, here's our chance to imitate

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:47.340
Jehovah to tell them how good they have done to focus on that. You see, when we do that,

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:54.220
it's going to help them to continue giving their best for Jehovah, and especially it's going to

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:58.220
help them to get through those moments when they feel like they've not done enough.

00:08:59.899 --> 00:09:04.460
So what have we learned? Well, we've learned that imperfection tends to make us perfectionists.

00:09:05.179 --> 00:09:12.460
And that's demanding, unreasonable, cold, right? It's difficult. We all have that inclination.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:17.820
But true perfection that comes from Jehovah is different. It's loving. It's considerate,

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:24.860
and it's reasonable. So when we feel the pressure that comes from unreasonable expectations,

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:33.500
don't snap. Don't give in to those negative feelings. Fight them by refocusing on Jehovah's perfect

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:41.820
example of being able to find joy in a work that's still a work in progress. When we do that,

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:47.179
we're going to be an oasis of comfort, both for ourselves and for those around us.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:54.220
And then Jehovah will look down and he'll see. He'll see our efforts trying to imitate him,

00:09:55.019 --> 00:10:03.019
we are also works in progress. And that's going to touch his heart. And he's going to say of us with

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:13.019
a warm smile of approval. Very good.
