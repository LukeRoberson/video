00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.710
Michel, have you seen anywhere else?

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.710
You didn't think we let you come here alone, did you?

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.710
That's right.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.710
You didn't hire him.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.990
Is this kid's one or the high top?

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:54.590
Nice to meet you.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.590
Joseph?

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.590
In Ferro's house?

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.590
No, like Joseph in the dungeon.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.590
Doesn't seem so bad to me.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:12.780
Kisla, you don't say something though.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:02:26.900
Move.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.900
You have been chosen because you were wise.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.469
But you are lacking.

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:39.469
You will learn our writing.

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:44.099
And our language.

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:50.650
You will be given new names.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.650
And at the end of three years,

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.650
you will serve the Great King.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.650
Now you can nether.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.919
Today.

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:08.580
You are foreigners.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.580
Tomorrow?

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.580
The God's willing.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:55.280
Avalonians.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.280
Meshach.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.770
You look like a Meshach.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.770
Our new names sound like their gods.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.770
New names, new language.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.770
Soon they want us to worship their gods.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.770
Calm down.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.770
My father had idols.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.770
And he worshiped Jehovah.

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.769
Did you see the same city I did?

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.769
It's the center of the world.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.980
We'll even eat from the King's table.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:32.290
But do Babylonians eat?

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.290
His servants are given only the best.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:51.430
Is there a problem?

00:04:51.430 --> 00:05:04.170
God doesn't allow us to eat such foods.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.089
Do you fear your God?

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:10.089
I do.

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:16.089
Well, I am afraid of my Lord the King.

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:20.819
Who has assigned your food and drink?

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:24.819
He insists on these selections

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:30.019
to maintain your strength and vitality.

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:34.019
What if he should see you looking worse than appearance

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:37.370
than the other youths?

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:43.660
Who would make me guilty before the King?

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.939
I must obey the King.

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:51.139
So must you.

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:56.709
All of you.

00:05:56.709 --> 00:05:58.709
When dinner is served,

00:05:58.709 --> 00:06:23.339
I expect you to be hungry.

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:28.279
You don't speak for us.

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:30.279
You're right.

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:31.279
You can make your own choice.

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:33.279
Didn't you hear him?

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:35.279
We don't have a choice.

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:37.279
It's a new land with new laws.

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:43.069
So what if some of the food is unblood?

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.069
It's just food.

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:47.069
But Jehovah commanded us not to eat blood.

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:51.339
It's your interpretation.

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:53.339
You must not eat any blood at all.

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:55.339
What's too interpret in that?

00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:58.339
Maybe we should all take a moment and pray.

00:06:58.339 --> 00:07:00.339
Pray.

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:01.339
Here.

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:05.879
What's the point?

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:07.879
Jehovah's in Israel.

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:09.879
We're in Babylon now.

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:12.879
Don't you believe Jehovah's here too?

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:19.949
Jehovah said that we're his witnesses.

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:21.949
What will people say about Jehovah

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:24.949
if we give in and break his laws?

00:07:24.949 --> 00:07:50.860
Your meal's ready.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:51.860
Did you hear me?

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:56.639
Thank you.

00:07:56.639 --> 00:07:58.639
But if we eat those foods,

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:01.639
we'll disobey our God.

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:04.209
Is it a starve?

00:08:04.209 --> 00:08:07.209
No, of course not, but...

00:08:07.209 --> 00:08:09.209
He forbids us from eating blood

00:08:09.209 --> 00:08:11.209
and food that he calls unclean.

00:08:11.209 --> 00:08:15.209
Please, test your servants for ten days.

00:08:15.209 --> 00:08:18.209
And let us be given some vegetables to eat

00:08:18.209 --> 00:08:21.209
and water to drink.

00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:22.209
Vegetables.

00:08:22.209 --> 00:08:30.459
Just give us ten days.

00:08:30.459 --> 00:08:32.460
And then deal with your servants

00:08:32.460 --> 00:11:14.389
according to what you see.

00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:36.700
Ashman has a summon you.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:37.700
He's young men or woman.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:38.700
I know who they are.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:12:02.299
We've been watching you.

00:12:02.299 --> 00:12:06.059
You don't bow to our idols.

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:09.059
You pray only to your God

00:12:09.059 --> 00:12:15.659
and you are not eating our foods.

00:12:15.659 --> 00:12:17.659
They insisted that their God would have them.

00:12:17.659 --> 00:12:26.100
And somehow you look healthier than the others.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.100
Continue giving them the diet they've requested.

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:35.929
And built a chasar?

00:12:35.929 --> 00:12:45.450
Your future is bright.

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:49.340
Don't waste it.
