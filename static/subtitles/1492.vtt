00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:10.359
Consider now a case that began in a small town but ended up before the Supreme Court of

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:14.900
the United States.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.899
The main issue with the Stratton Ohio Court case was that the village of Stratton was requiring

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:23.940
Jehovah's Witnesses to obtain a permit from the town before Jehovah's Witnesses engaged

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.820
in their door-to-door public ministry.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.059
They very specifically did not want Jehovah's Witnesses knocking on their doors.

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:38.119
The ordinances that were enacted were specifically designed to restrict the activity of Jehovah's

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:39.420
Witnesses.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.740
The issue really came to a head with a group of our sisters who were engaged in return

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.299
visits and the mayor said to them, people moved to Stratton because they know they don't

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:50.820
have to be bothered by Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.500
The witnesses tried to work the matter out with the municipality, with the village.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.020
There was communication, there was dialogue, but the village was insistent that

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.340
our brothers and sisters obtained permits prior to going from door to door.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.780
The decision was made to bring the case to court.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.340
We brought the case in Federal District Court in Ohio.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.060
The Federal District Court judge ruled against us.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.060
So we appealed in the federal system up to the United States quarter of appeals for the

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.620
sixth circuit.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.019
They ruled against us in a two-to-one decision.

00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:30.420
There were similar cases in the past in the 1930s and 1940s, but the Supreme Court hadn't

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.180
really addressed the matter for decades.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.780
So it was now a question in a new era where those cases still controlling law.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.099
This issue of going door to door that was raised in Stratton, Ohio, caught the attention

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:52.140
of the attorney generals of many states, and quite a number of them joined in friend

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.939
of the court or Amicus briefs in support of the position taken by the Attorney General

00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:59.260
of Ohio.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.459
So we were confronting not just the opposition from state authorities in Ohio, but the opposition

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:11.740
to our witnessing effort on the part of other states who also agreed that Jehovah's Witnesses

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:18.909
should have their rights limited as they try to engage in their door to door activity.

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:24.750
To take the matter on appeal to the Supreme Court, would run the risk of perhaps diluting

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.990
victories that we had obtained in the 40s and 50s.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:35.590
But the governing body when they considered this issue did not focus on whether this case

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.550
might undermine these earlier decisions.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.310
The simple question was, do the authorities have the right to restrict our door to door

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:51.219
activity in Stratton, Ohio?

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:58.460
We'll hear our next number 001737, the Watchtower Bible and Track Society of New York versus

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.659
the village of Stratton, Ohio.

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:08.500
It's 11 o'clock Saturday morning in the village of Stratton.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.699
Good morning.

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:14.620
In light of recent events, I've made a special effort to come to your door to speak to you

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.500
about what the prophet Isaiah has referred to as the good news of something better.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.180
That's the good news Christ Jesus spoke about, the good news of the kingdom of God.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.979
It is a criminal act to go from door to door on the village of Stratton and deliver that

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:33.939
message, unless one has first obtained a permit from the village to do so.

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:39.060
You know, we go into it, we prepare from a secular vantage point as hard as we can.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.379
We do all our good work, all our efforts.

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:45.780
We throw our arrows to the ground, but ultimately it's Jehovah's Battle.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.939
But our task is not to win at all cost.

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:54.060
Our task is to prepare so that if it be Jehovah's will, we can prevail.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.659
And I do remember that moment before the argument, because you stand in front of them and

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:05.379
the way the court has constructed with the podium, they, you're very close to them.

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:09.900
Almost as close as you and I are, but they sit up a little higher and they surround you.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.219
So the only thing that you see is them.

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:17.980
And you stand there and you wait for the chief justice who at that time was William Rinkwist

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.779
to announce the case and invite you to speak.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:25.779
And I remember I was there for a few seconds, maybe 10, 15 seconds.

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:30.019
And I realized the enormity of what was about to take place.

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:34.500
And I prayed and I knew that Jehovah would help and he did.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.100
One of the things that impressed me in the oral argument before the Supreme Court with

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:45.980
regard to Stratton was the respect that the Supreme Court justices accorded to Brother

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.459
Paulador and myself.

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:55.740
Quite to the contrary, when the representatives of Ohio and the municipality stood to present

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:03.180
their argument, their assertions were met with open cynicism on the part of the justices.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.939
You think it's, it's a beautiful idea that I have to ask the government for permission

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:13.540
before I go down the block where I don't know all of the people I waived to them but I

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.540
don't really know them.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.980
I say I want to talk to you because I'm concerned about the garbage pickup because I'm

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.980
concerned about our Congress and whatever.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.139
I have to ask the government before I can do that.

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:24.139
No you're not.

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:25.139
No you're not.

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:26.139
No you're not.

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.980
But we are talking about our canvassers, hawkers and those who are going door to door

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:30.980
for a cause.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.980
Well how about trick-or-treaters?

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.420
Do they have to go get a permit?

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.420
Under this ordinance it looks like it doesn't it?

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.420
You're not.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:42.420
And they're soliciting too.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.939
They are.

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:51.379
So in rather sweeping language the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the village of Stratton's

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:54.870
ordinance.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:01.870
Initially, we won a certain degree and did not win to a certain degree before one of

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.870
the lower courts.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:11.069
The governing body in theory could have taken the approach well, this somewhat victory,

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:15.910
somewhat defeat, only limits our witnessing activity in the state of Ohio.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.310
So we'll leave it at that.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.670
Of course that's not an option.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:27.670
When Jehovah tells us to engage in the ministry and when Jesus says to make disciples of people

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.110
of all the nations, that includes everyone.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.269
Well we couldn't do this on our own.

00:06:33.269 --> 00:06:37.870
When you think about this we're battling governmental entities.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:42.629
In the Stratton case it was the village of Stratton, the state of Ohio, as well as a number

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:46.670
of other states that came in in opposition.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.310
We're just a handful of brothers and sisters.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.550
Jehovah God is obviously supporting and blessing us.
