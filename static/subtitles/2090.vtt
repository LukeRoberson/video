00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:11.400
Today, we use videos just about everywhere in our worship and ministry.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.399
But did you know that Jehovah's people started using film and video to preach and teach more than a hundred years ago?

00:00:18.399 --> 00:00:26.969
Let's see how and why in this episode of Our History in Motion.

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:35.229
When the early Bible students first began preaching in the late 1800s,

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:39.229
the motion picture industry was in its infancy.

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:46.229
But even then, C.T. Russell and his associates recognized the power of this new medium.

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:53.229
Film could be used not only to reach wider audiences, but to touch hearts with Bible truth.

00:00:53.229 --> 00:01:03.210
At a convention in June 1913, the Bible students passed a bold resolution,

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.209
supporting the use of motion pictures as a new tool for preaching and teaching.

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:18.209
Less than a year later, in January 1914, the brothers debuted, the photo drama of creation.

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:24.209
The eight-hour production included color slides and motion picture film,

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:29.209
most of it footage that Russell purchased from other studios.

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:36.209
Imagine sitting in a packed auditorium and seeing, possibly for the first time,

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:43.379
moving pictures of events described in the Bible.

00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:48.379
And there was something else in the photo drama that really took audiences by surprise.

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:55.379
The photo drama of creation is presented by the I.C.S.H.,

00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:59.379
the International Bible Student Association.

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:02.379
Synchronized dialogue.

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:07.379
The photo drama played in theaters and auditoriums around the world.

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:13.379
But what if film could be used to teach the truth not just in big theaters,

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.379
but right in a person's own living room?

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:22.379
That was the idea behind a series of short films released in the 1920s.

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:28.379
These silent films, chronicling the travels of JF Rutherford in the Bible lands,

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.379
were designed to be shown at home.

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.379
They required the use of the Kenamo projection machine,

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:41.379
a portable, low-cost movie projector made just for this purpose.

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:46.379
Interested ones who viewed these films were given a glimpse of the Bible lands

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.379
and were introduced to many prophecies.

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:55.379
Over the next two decades, the organization used radio and the photograph

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:00.379
rather than film to reach more people with the Kingdom message.

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:05.379
But in the 1950s, the governing body recognized the need for interested ones

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:10.379
to see for themselves the international scope of the organization.

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:17.379
So they again turned to film with the release of the New World Society in Action.

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:23.379
This one-hour and 20-minute film transported viewers to our Bethel facilities

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.379
and international conventions.

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:34.360
It gave them a taste of what it's like to preach in some of the remotest parts of the world.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.360
Additional films released over the next several years,

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.360
further highlighted the work of God's people and the fulfillment of Bible prophecies.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.360
Then, in 1966, we released Heritage.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:58.360
This 28-minute feature was unflinching in its portrayal of the real world problems young people face.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:06.020
Within the next 60 seconds, another family somewhere in the United States

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.020
would be strained to the breaking point.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.020
What's this? Just a family quarrel?

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.019
No, it is far more serious than that.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.019
What is it doing to this family?

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.019
Following Bible principles, builds a solid family foundation.

00:04:24.019 --> 00:04:29.019
Heritage was presented at circuit assemblies and other large gatherings.

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:36.019
It was also shown on more than 150 television stations in the United States.

00:04:37.019 --> 00:04:42.019
After 1966, the organization shifted away from film

00:04:42.019 --> 00:04:47.019
and began presenting modern and biblical dramas live on stage at conventions.

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:51.019
These dramas brought Bible accounts to life for young and old

00:04:51.019 --> 00:04:56.019
and were one of the highlights of large conventions for many years.

00:04:56.019 --> 00:05:00.019
But as the 1990s approached, new technologies emerged

00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:04.019
that prompted our brothers to revisit motion pictures yet again.

00:05:04.019 --> 00:05:09.019
Video cassette players could be found in more and more homes.

00:05:09.019 --> 00:05:16.019
And so, in 1990, we released our very first video, Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:05:16.019 --> 00:05:19.019
the organization behind the name.

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:23.019
It took viewers behind the scenes and built appreciation

00:05:23.019 --> 00:05:28.019
for how our literature is produced and used in the global preaching work.

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:35.649
The faithful and discrete slave has made extensive use of video ever since.

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:42.930
Motion picture technology has changed dramatically in 100 years.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.930
But the objective of Jehovah's organization in using it has always been the same.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.930
To touch the hearts of people everywhere with Bible truth.
