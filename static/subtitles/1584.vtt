00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:39.820
You're late.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.670
I said you're late.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.670
Sorry.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:01:18.920
You work here now?

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.969
Yeah, just a few weeks.

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:24.969
You look great.

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:34.420
What kind of get you?

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.420
I tried texting you, you know.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.420
After you ended it.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.010
Try last day. That was your favourite.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.480
Jade, you were my favourite.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:02:05.950
Oli, you know why I have to...

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.949
I know, but I want to study your religion.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.949
Yeah, that's why I texted it.

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:17.289
Well, I got a new phone and I didn't...

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:18.289
I didn't see them.

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:22.210
Okay, but...

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.210
How about I leave you my number and we can meet up?

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:32.750
That's when you walked away.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.750
Tell me you walked away.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.960
He gave me his number.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.960
What?

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.960
No.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.960
Jade.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.960
He said he wants to study.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.960
Yeah, he wants to study you.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.960
We can't read hearts.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.960
I think I can read yours.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:03.050
He was sweet.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:09.050
And if he wants to know the truth...

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.050
I...

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.030
I can't even believe this.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.030
What does it say?

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.259
It says low battery.

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:24.259
No.

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:25.259
This.

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:27.259
Second Corinthians 614.

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:33.310
Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.310
There was no yoking.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.310
I haven't yoked.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.310
But this opens the door to the yok.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.310
I'm not stupid.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.310
You act like I don't know this.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.310
No, you act like you don't know this.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:58.400
That's a lot of backstory.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.400
You asked what happened.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.400
I thought you're like, you know,

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.400
some open a word or something.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.400
Anyway.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.400
No, you know.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:15.120
So, are you gonna call him then?

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.120
I don't think so.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.120
Why not?

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.120
Because I don't think it's religion that he's interested in.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.720
I could have told you that.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:05:00.019
I made you a cup.

00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:01.019
You're amazing.

00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:05.959
Listen.

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:11.350
I'm sorry.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.350
I know I came all strong.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.350
No.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.350
You were right.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:22.129
But I could have been more patient.

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:24.129
I reacted too quickly.

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:28.860
I know you know what the right thing to do is.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.649
I should have given you more time to talk out.

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:42.930
I called Brother Davies and gave him the background

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.930
and said if he's really interested,

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.370
he'll have a study.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.370
Then I deleted Ollie's number.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.100
I knew it.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.100
I knew you'd do the right thing.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.100
Well, sometimes.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:06.689
But I should have been more patient.

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:08.689
And I should have heard you out.

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:14.769
It's just not what I wanted to hear in the moment.

00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:18.939
So we're good?

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:19.939
Always.

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:25.379
No more apologizing until I finish this coffee.

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:27.379
It's too painful.

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:33.180
It's so nice.
