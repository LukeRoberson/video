00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:08.300
It's wonderful that we can be together for this year's exercise patience convention.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.300
It's been four years since we've had an in-person regional convention.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:20.300
Your patience in waiting for this day will be rewarded.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:28.300
Speaking for the governing body, I can say that this will be an excellent program for all of us to enjoy.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:38.299
We'll benefit from over 40 talks, as well as videos, a dramatic Bible reading and a two-part feature-length drama.

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:48.299
And all of this is designed to build us up and to help us endure the remaining days of this old world.

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:57.299
As you can see from the theme of this year's program, we're especially highlighting the quality of patience.

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:00.299
Patients originates with Jehovah.

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:11.299
It's one of the nine aspects of the fruitage of his spirit that are listed at Galatians chapter 5 verses 22 and 23.

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:26.299
If you had memorized that list of qualities some years ago, when reciting it, you would have said that the first four aspects are love, joy, peace, and long suffering.

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:40.299
However, in the 2013 revision of the New World Translation, the governing body decided to change the expression long suffering to patience.

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.299
Why the change?

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.299
Languages are not static. They evolve.

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:57.299
This is obvious when comparing the translations that are on display in the Bible Museum at our World Headquarters in Warwick, New York.

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:10.300
For example, in the 16th century, when William Tindale translated the Greek scriptures into English, he had to invent many new words.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:21.300
One of those words was long suffering. That word long suffering continued to be used in many other English Bibles.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:31.300
But the language used in 1526 is very different from the English language spoken today.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:39.300
We've had to respond to changes in language in order to touch the heart of today's reader.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:50.300
You see, these days, people often misunderstand the term long suffering, thinking that it simply means someone who suffers for a long time.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:03:02.300
But that could describe a very impatient person who has to put up with a situation that's out of his control, whether he really wants to endure it or not.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:11.300
Instead, the original language words used in the Bible indicate a more positive mean.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:20.300
Long suffering does not mean merely suffering long or just putting up with a trying situation.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:30.300
It involves deliberate restraint or calm endurance, which is better expressed by the word patience.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:40.300
When a patient person is wronged or provoked, he remains calm as he awaits the outcome of the situation.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:51.300
Additionally, patience is a quality that must be shown in all circumstances, not just when enduring an offense, a hardship, or a trial.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:04:08.300
We must exercise patience in everyday situations with one's spouse and children, with aging parents and other relatives, with friends in the congregation, in public as when sharing in the ministry,

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:16.300
when in line at a store or when driving a vehicle in traffic.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:24.300
Can you see why this aspect of the fruitage of the Spirit is especially necessary now?

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:34.300
We live in an impatient world, more and more people are not willing to wait for anyone or anything.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.300
When they want something, they want it now.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:44.300
That attitude can rub off on us if we're not on guard.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:05:07.300
That is why for three days, we're going to delve into the Bible to see some beautiful examples of patience that we can imitate, Jehovah God, Jesus Christ, faithful men and women of old, including God's ancient prophets, and modern-day examples.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:18.300
We'll learn why we need patience, how we can exercise it, and what blessings await those who are patient.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:25.300
Now, please give your full attention to the entire program.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.300
Follow along in the Bible.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:45.300
Take note of the points that especially touch your heart and know that we on the governing body love you all and continue to pray that you will keep on patiently enduring to the end.
