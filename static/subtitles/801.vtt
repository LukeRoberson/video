WEBVTT

00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:04.599
Well, now we look forward to the next speaker.

00:00:04.599 --> 00:00:06.719
This is by the Stephen Lett.

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:10.400
Also of the governing body, he gives us the theme here,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:22.469
never give up much for little.

00:00:22.469 --> 00:00:27.469
Jesus gave a parable about a young man

00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:32.469
who exchanged peace and prosperity in his father's household

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.350
for a debauched, miserable, desperate life.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.350
Foolishly, he exchanged much for little.

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:47.229
It's the story of the prodigal son, Luke chapter 15.

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:50.829
In contrast, in Matthew chapter 13,

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.509
Jesus gave a story about a traveling merchant

00:00:55.509 --> 00:01:00.509
who sold everything he had to buy one pearl of high value.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.790
When we understand the meaning of that parable

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:09.829
in actuality, he exchanged little for much.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.670
Now, obviously, your brothers and sisters

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.230
do not want to imitate the prodigal son,

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.310
you want to imitate the traveling merchant.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.310
And Jehovah doesn't want you to give away much for little.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.829
He wants you to give away little for much.

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.909
And Jehovah is anxious to give you this much.

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.950
That's why he's recorded parables,

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.150
such as the two we just mentioned,

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.829
and also real life stories in his word

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.510
that depict both scenarios so that we can be wise.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.510
In fact, let's briefly discuss four Bible examples

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.829
of ones who foolishly gave up much for little.

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.069
And then we'll talk about four Bible examples

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:01.310
of ones who gave up little for much.

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:04.109
Our first example, Satan.

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:08.710
Now, Satan gave up a priceless honored position

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.830
of trust in Jehovah's service

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.830
that he may have enjoyed for eons of time.

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.990
And what did he receive for what he gave up?

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.349
A relatively short, miserable life of independence

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.669
from Jehovah, and ultimately he will have earned for himself

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.469
the lake of fire.

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:34.750
We know right now, Satan cannot be happy at all.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.349
Jehovah is described as a happy God.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.349
First Timothy 111, Jesus, the happy potentate.

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.229
First Timothy 615, happy as the nation

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:52.550
whose God is Jehovah Psalm 3312.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.629
But Satan has never described as anything close to happy, is he?

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:01.349
I mean, he's described as an enraged, roaring lion,

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.469
an accuser who accuses day and night.

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:09.189
One who has great anger because he knows this time is short.

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.949
Does that sound like a happy person?

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:16.949
But what caused Satan to give up so much for so little?

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.110
Pride.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.110
Pride actually caused him to think

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.669
that he was smarter than Jehovah.

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:28.189
Can you imagine that the clay was smarter than the potter?

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:32.110
A pride caused him to think that life without Jehovah

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.550
would actually be better life.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.909
Well, may we never pridefully feel

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:41.629
that we know better than Jehovah in any areas?

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:44.629
For example, how to treat this fellowship once?

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.349
The need to avoid bad association,

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:50.669
marrying only in the Lord as a few examples.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.270
May we never pridefully feel

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.430
that the so-called freedom from Jehovah

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.550
that the world offers will bring happiness.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.830
Let's learn from Satan.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.830
Never allow pride to cause you to give up much for little.

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:12.270
Now, our second example, Adam and Eve.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.230
Satan offered them the opportunity to be like God,

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.069
his own aspiration.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:22.029
And stupidly, I mean stupidly,

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.230
they bought into his hoax.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.310
They selfishly gave up their invaluable family ties

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.509
with the best father they could ever have.

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:37.670
They gave up their paradise home,

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.470
perfect everlasting life.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.750
Their children's future welfare.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.149
All for what?

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.029
A relatively short, miserable life of independence

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:52.949
from Jehovah, and finally, non-existence.

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:54.389
A total loss.

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:58.310
What an outstanding example of giving up much for little.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.629
So may we learn from Adam and Eve.

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:06.509
Never allow Satan's lies to cause you to give up

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.269
a much for little.

00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:13.670
At lies such as material things will make you happy.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.790
Or immorality will make you happy.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.430
Unlike Adam and Eve,

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.430
let's refuse to allow Satan's lies

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.069
to cause us to give up much for little.

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:28.029
Esau our third example,

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:31.990
knew the history of Satan and Adam and Eve,

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.189
but did he learn from them?

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:38.389
No, he too lacked appreciation for sacred things.

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:41.389
Esau was Isaac's firstborn son,

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:44.509
and in Bible times this had great value.

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:49.029
But he thought only of his immediate physical cravings.

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:53.709
Genesis 2532 says he became very hungry and cried out,

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.910
I am about to die.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.189
Was he really?

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:04.389
Should he have not endured a little bit longer

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:06.990
rather than sell his birthright?

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.550
Now, pretty quick, he realized his mistake.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.149
He saw something with real value.

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:13.589
For what?

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:15.470
I mean, what did he receive?

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.269
Some bread and lentils stew.

00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:24.819
Apparently this stew didn't even have any meat in it.

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:26.139
We bathelites.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.620
We can get bread, lentils, and meat for free

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:38.120
in the Bethel pantry.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.480
What is a lesson we can learn from Esau?

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:45.160
We'll open up to Hebrews chapter 12, please.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.040
And here's a very interesting lesson.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.639
Jehovah teaches us about Esau.

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:53.399
Hebrews 12 verse 16.

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:57.399
And watch that among you there is no one

00:06:57.399 --> 00:07:02.399
who is sexually immoral, nor anyone

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:07.240
who does not appreciate sacred things like Esau,

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:12.240
who gave up his rights as firstborn in exchange for one meal.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.160
But you know, interestingly,

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.720
Jehovah compares a person who commits sexual immorality

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.519
to what Esau did.

00:07:20.519 --> 00:07:24.959
And if you think about it, both lacking self-control

00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:27.800
given to fleshly desires, that's what Esau did.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.319
That's what a person who commits sexual immorality

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:35.319
will make none of us allow immorality

00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:38.160
to cause us to sell our figurative birthright,

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.759
our inheritance in Jehovah's New World.

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:42.279
And think about this.

00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:47.879
How long did that bread and lentil stew last, Esau?

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:50.120
How long did it benefit him?

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.879
A few hours?

00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:54.519
Soon he would have been hungry again.

00:07:54.519 --> 00:07:57.079
Well, similarly, how long does the so-called pleasure

00:07:57.079 --> 00:07:59.519
of an immoral person last?

00:07:59.519 --> 00:08:04.000
Only a short time followed by horrible consequences,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.759
including a bad conscience.

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:12.600
In our fourth example, the rich young ruler in Jesus' day,

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.519
he held high position, had many possessions.

00:08:16.519 --> 00:08:19.600
Jesus even felt love for him.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.519
But was he prepared to give up his wealth

00:08:22.519 --> 00:08:26.399
for something infinitely more valuable and permanent,

00:08:26.399 --> 00:08:29.639
the treasure of following Jesus?

00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:30.959
No.

00:08:30.959 --> 00:08:36.600
When Jesus invited him, the Bible says, he went away grieved.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.559
He couldn't bring himself to give up his many possessions.

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:44.000
Instead, he gave up a wonderful future.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.759
Obviously, he gave up the wrong thing, didn't he?

00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:50.240
Where are those who did follow Jesus now?

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.600
Immortal, kings and priests,

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.200
with Christ in heaven, in Jehovah's presence.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.559
But unless that young ruler later changed his ways,

00:08:59.559 --> 00:09:04.559
he and all that was his are now dust.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:10.480
What a classic example of giving up so much for so little,

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:15.759
may we never allow any of the material attractions

00:09:15.759 --> 00:09:20.360
of this world to cause us to give up our wonderful future

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.919
in Jehovah's New World.

00:09:22.919 --> 00:09:25.879
Well, we've considered our four negative examples,

00:09:25.879 --> 00:09:29.559
but let us move to our four positive examples,

00:09:29.559 --> 00:09:31.879
ones who gave up little for much.

00:09:31.919 --> 00:09:36.240
First, Abraham, at Jehovah's invitation,

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:41.240
Abraham gave up a comfortable life in upscale earth.

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:45.960
At Jehovah's invitation,

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.960
he took his family on a long, dangerous trek

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.679
to the land of promised.

00:09:50.679 --> 00:09:55.200
And there, he willingly lived the rest of his life intense.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.240
But what did Abraham receive for what he gave up?

00:09:59.519 --> 00:10:03.159
He gained a permanent place in Jehovah's heart.

00:10:03.159 --> 00:10:07.159
A Jehovah himself called him my friend

00:10:07.159 --> 00:10:09.799
because of his faith, Jehovah's War,

00:10:09.799 --> 00:10:12.840
that through one of his descendants,

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.919
all nations would be blessed.

00:10:15.919 --> 00:10:19.919
And that descendant, the Messiah, Jesus will soon

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:24.919
resurrect Abraham to enjoy the real life.

00:10:24.919 --> 00:10:29.200
But now, are we willing to give up material possessions

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.159
and comforts in order, for example,

00:10:31.159 --> 00:10:33.480
to enter the full-time ministry,

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.919
or maybe be able to move and serve with an edict greater?

00:10:36.919 --> 00:10:41.919
In order to secure a permanent place in Jehovah's heart,

00:10:42.759 --> 00:10:47.279
like Abraham, are we willing to give up little for much?

00:10:48.679 --> 00:10:53.720
Our second example, Moses, centuries after Abraham,

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:57.000
Moses also gave up the right things.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:02.000
Raised as royalty in Pharaoh's palace,

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.240
he was groomed for greatness in the world of his day.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.519
He knew all about the Egypt's advanced civilization

00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:11.360
and culture.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.200
But the Bible doesn't elaborate on anything

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:18.039
that Moses accomplished in Egypt.

00:11:18.039 --> 00:11:19.399
Of why?

00:11:19.399 --> 00:11:22.240
Because anything he may have achieved there

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.840
was utterly insignificant

00:11:24.879 --> 00:11:27.399
compared to what he did in Jehovah's service.

00:11:27.399 --> 00:11:32.399
Moses received the law that led Israel to the Messiah.

00:11:33.519 --> 00:11:38.039
No other prophet knew Jehovah, quote, face to face.

00:11:39.039 --> 00:11:42.679
He did well in giving up life in Egypt

00:11:42.679 --> 00:11:45.480
in order to carry out God's commission.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.159
As for the wealth and grandeur of ancient Egypt,

00:11:49.159 --> 00:11:54.000
we can see crumbling remnants of it in museums.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
But Moses gained God's favor, he gained the real life,

00:11:59.279 --> 00:12:03.759
he gained a permanent place in our spiritual heritage

00:12:03.759 --> 00:12:08.440
and a permanent place in all of our hearts.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.639
Well, let's go to our third example, Jesus.

00:12:11.639 --> 00:12:15.480
The best example of gaining a lot more than he gave up.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:20.480
Like Abraham and Moses, he willingly gave up a comfortable life.

00:12:20.879 --> 00:12:25.120
Now in his case, life and heaven alongside Jehovah,

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.240
but he emptied himself, became a human,

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.840
ministered to other humans,

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:34.480
even gave his life, trusting that Jehovah

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.279
would give life back to him.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.519
He gained the great joy of fulfilling

00:12:41.519 --> 00:12:44.639
his father's righteous purpose

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:48.600
and redeeming those he was especially fond of.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.960
Humans.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.519
If you think about it, apparently Jesus

00:12:52.519 --> 00:12:56.000
didn't really realize how much he would receive

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.480
for what he gave up.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.000
Because remember in John 17.5, he said,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Father, glorify me with a glory I had alongside you

00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:07.799
before the world was.

00:13:07.799 --> 00:13:11.840
In other words, Father, please give me back what I had before.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.120
But Jehovah gave him a lot more, didn't he?

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.120
And that's always true of Jehovah, really.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.519
If you think about it, you can't outgive Jehovah.

00:13:20.519 --> 00:13:24.639
Jehovah gave him a name more excellent

00:13:24.639 --> 00:13:27.639
than the angels.

00:13:27.639 --> 00:13:32.639
Jehovah gave him all authority in heaven and earth.

00:13:32.639 --> 00:13:37.639
He even gave him immortality and incorruption.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:43.080
And we know that means an indestructible life

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.080
and indestructible organism or body.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.200
Now our fourth example, Jesus Apostles,

00:13:54.399 --> 00:13:58.480
Peter, Andrew, James, and John abandoned

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.080
their fishing businesses, didn't he?

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.799
All the other Apostles, the Bible says,

00:14:02.799 --> 00:14:04.039
left all things.

00:14:04.039 --> 00:14:07.360
And remember, Peter asked, Lord, we've left all things

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:12.360
and followed you, what then will there be for us?

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:17.840
Well, Jesus assured him that anyone gives up material things

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.320
or even family relationships for him

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.039
or for the sake of the good news

00:14:23.039 --> 00:14:26.960
would receive a hundredfold even now.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:27.960
Do you think about that?

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.399
That's a 10,000% return.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.960
Plus, he will get everlasting life.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.360
In fact, think about it, where are these Apostles now?

00:14:39.399 --> 00:14:44.159
Like Jesus, immortal, incorruptible spirit creatures.

00:14:44.159 --> 00:14:46.519
Open up to Revelation chapter 20

00:14:46.519 --> 00:14:50.080
and notice what is said about these wines.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.960
Revelation chapter 20, please.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:57.960
And notice for a six, it says happy.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.279
Notice that word happy.

00:15:00.279 --> 00:15:05.279
And holy is anyone having part in the first resurrection

00:15:05.919 --> 00:15:09.919
over these, the second death has no authority,

00:15:09.919 --> 00:15:12.879
but they will be priest of God and of the Christ

00:15:12.879 --> 00:15:16.919
and they will relish kings with him for the thousand years.

00:15:16.919 --> 00:15:20.039
So they're going to be happy in their assignment.

00:15:20.039 --> 00:15:22.360
This is assured in this scripture.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.080
Why are they going to be so happy?

00:15:25.159 --> 00:15:28.679
Acts 20, 35, there's more happiness and giving

00:15:28.679 --> 00:15:29.519
than receiving.

00:15:29.519 --> 00:15:33.480
And what an occasion the thousand years will be forgiving.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.360
Can you imagine assisting humans

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.399
to transform the entire planet into

00:15:39.399 --> 00:15:42.120
a originally intended condition?

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:46.720
Imagine working closely with the Christ to empty the grave

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:51.720
and gradually helping humans to come to perfection.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.759
And then after the thousand years,

00:15:54.759 --> 00:15:57.840
being able to share in the final crushing of evil Satan

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:02.840
and his wicked demons, what hapeifying work all of this will be.

00:16:03.679 --> 00:16:06.720
But what will be their main source of happiness?

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:10.320
Well, being part of the main instrument, the kingdom

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:15.320
that Jehovah will use to sanctify and vindicate his holy name.

00:16:31.059 --> 00:16:33.500
I thought I'd go ahead and put to work that

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:37.139
new understanding, brother Jackson revealed earlier.

00:16:37.139 --> 00:16:42.139
But it's true to vindicate Jehovah's name, his reputation.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:45.860
That'll bring the greatest happiness to that.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:48.620
You can be sure when the apostles gave up

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:53.340
their little fishing businesses and the other apostles,

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:57.460
their worldly pursuits, they had no idea

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:00.820
how much they would receive in return.

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:04.059
Well, now we've discussed Abraham, Moses, Jesus,

00:17:04.059 --> 00:17:07.339
the apostles and there's no doubt about it.

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:11.420
They would all wholeheartedly agree that what they gave up

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:15.019
was very small compared to what they gained.

00:17:15.019 --> 00:17:16.420
Well, what about us?

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.099
We all give up things, don't we?

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:21.660
Great and small for Jehovah.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:25.420
We may give up time, energy, money, possessions.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:29.539
We may have to give up a little face, prestige in this world.

00:17:29.539 --> 00:17:34.539
But we will experience what all those good Bible examples did,

00:17:35.339 --> 00:17:40.339
what we get back always, far outweighs in a loss.

00:17:41.099 --> 00:17:43.980
In fact, most of us would probably say,

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.180
we feel like we haven't given up anything.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:52.220
We're receiving like those men of old 100 times more now.

00:17:53.859 --> 00:17:58.859
And we are sure to gain life, the real life

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:04.140
if we never give up much for little.

00:18:17.289 --> 00:18:21.089
I'm sure we all totally enjoyed that encouragement.

00:18:22.049 --> 00:18:24.930
Well, now at this point, you're probably thinking we said

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:27.769
there was an adjusted understanding.

00:18:27.769 --> 00:18:29.569
You got that one?

00:18:29.569 --> 00:18:32.849
A lot of encouragement, yes.

00:18:32.849 --> 00:18:35.609
Then there was the one about the year text, yes.

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:37.490
What was the other one?

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:39.529
Well, we've come to the final talk.

00:18:39.529 --> 00:18:42.730
If we don't get it now, it's not going to come.

00:18:44.009 --> 00:18:46.609
Remember, we said an adjustment

00:18:46.609 --> 00:18:48.650
to the way we do our ministry.

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:50.769
So with eager anticipation,

00:18:50.769 --> 00:18:53.769
we look forward to hearing from brother Anthony Morris,

00:18:53.769 --> 00:19:09.589
who will talk to us about making our blows count.

00:19:09.589 --> 00:19:14.109
We are involved in the greatest preaching campaign

00:19:14.109 --> 00:19:15.710
in all history.

00:19:17.109 --> 00:19:22.109
We publish quality literature to 140 lands.

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:24.789
It's amazing.

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:28.789
However, we're not about seeking praise

00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:31.630
for the quality of our magazines

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:35.789
or the hundreds of languages that we're translating in.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:38.390
What's our focus?

00:19:39.349 --> 00:19:41.470
Well, we want to imitate

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:44.349
what the Apostle Paul wrote about himself

00:19:44.349 --> 00:19:49.349
in the governing body really wants this message to be clear.

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:52.470
So all of God's people that are preachers

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:55.430
and teachers of the kingdom.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:59.470
So find what I'm referring to in first Corinthians,

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:09.759
chapter nine, and you'll remember

00:20:09.759 --> 00:20:12.680
he's describing his pursuit of the prize,

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:17.319
and it's quite profound when you reflect on it,

00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:19.759
and you'll see where it fits every one of us

00:20:19.759 --> 00:20:24.000
that are dedicated to the true God, verse 26.

00:20:25.119 --> 00:20:29.640
Therefore, the way I am running is not aimlessly.

00:20:30.599 --> 00:20:33.519
The way I am aiming my blows is,

00:20:33.519 --> 00:20:36.759
so it's not to be striking the air.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:43.160
So you can picture running aimlessly.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.960
It's a waste of time and energy.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:50.960
Striking the air, a waste of time and energy.

00:20:53.839 --> 00:20:58.099
So the time left reduced,

00:20:59.099 --> 00:21:01.099
the end is so close.

00:21:01.099 --> 00:21:04.660
And I've told folks, if you look around

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:08.339
and you don't see how different it is and how close it is,

00:21:08.339 --> 00:21:09.940
you must be in a coma.

00:21:11.019 --> 00:21:14.900
And that's okay, God can bring you out of a coma

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.940
if you're all right before that.

00:21:17.859 --> 00:21:20.460
But the governing body's concern

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:22.940
with the limited time we have left

00:21:23.859 --> 00:21:26.940
that we make our blows count.

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:31.700
So to truly make our blows count,

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:35.180
what should be the focus of our work?

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:40.460
We're not left without knowing how Jehovah thinks.

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:42.019
It's been here all along,

00:21:42.859 --> 00:21:45.539
but sometimes we can individually

00:21:45.539 --> 00:21:49.140
and even organizationally get distracted.

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:55.410
It turned to Acts chapter 13.

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:57.250
Acts chapter 13.

00:21:59.009 --> 00:22:01.170
And they were preaching there in the first century

00:22:01.529 --> 00:22:05.289
and we get some results and we also get God's thinking

00:22:05.289 --> 00:22:10.289
on the matter and what He wants us to focus on.

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:13.450
Acts 13 verse 48.

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:18.210
When those of the nations heard this message,

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:22.009
they began to rejoice and to glorify the word of Jehovah.

00:22:22.009 --> 00:22:27.170
Now notice, in all those who were rightly disposed

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:33.640
for everlasting life became believers.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:34.599
There it is.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:39.279
That's the focus of our work.

00:22:39.279 --> 00:22:43.000
Searching for those rightly disposed

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.880
for everlasting life.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:49.480
It's not complicated and to try to help somebody

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.839
that's not rightly disposed,

00:22:51.839 --> 00:22:54.279
frankly, is a waste of time.

00:22:54.279 --> 00:22:55.599
Now we don't read hearts,

00:22:55.599 --> 00:22:58.599
we understand that people can change

00:22:58.640 --> 00:22:59.799
and we continue with that.

00:22:59.799 --> 00:23:03.799
But overall, Jehovah wants us to understand,

00:23:03.799 --> 00:23:08.240
let's search out for those that are rightly disposed

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.480
for everlasting life.

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.000
Because no one comes to the truth,

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.200
remember, as Jesus taught us,

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.079
unless Jehovah draws Him.

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.039
We don't want to get thinking

00:23:19.039 --> 00:23:21.720
our personality draws people to the truth.

00:23:22.799 --> 00:23:25.119
You might be likable, it's wonderful.

00:23:26.119 --> 00:23:30.119
However, Jehovah draws those rightly disposed

00:23:30.839 --> 00:23:33.079
and you become friends and such,

00:23:33.079 --> 00:23:35.559
if you have the privilege to study with people,

00:23:35.559 --> 00:23:37.559
but that's what it's about.

00:23:37.559 --> 00:23:40.160
Searching those rightly disposed ones,

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:45.160
that's who he draws, those that are righteous leads.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.000
He reads the heart.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
And so we're in this search work,

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.559
but we're looking to focus on those rightly disposed.

00:23:53.559 --> 00:23:56.920
So with that clear,

00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:00.720
the governing body is identified in two problems.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:03.880
And this is what we want to pass on

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:07.079
and it can adversely affect our effectiveness

00:24:07.079 --> 00:24:08.079
in the ministry.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.440
And this is what we're about,

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.799
a preaching and teaching organization.

00:24:13.799 --> 00:24:15.599
This is who we are.

00:24:15.599 --> 00:24:19.640
So for many years, and we acknowledge it,

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.240
there was a focus on placing magazines.

00:24:24.559 --> 00:24:26.720
Developing magazine routes.

00:24:27.759 --> 00:24:29.839
I'd help some come into the truth,

00:24:29.839 --> 00:24:32.240
no denying it, because our literature

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.039
is the best on the earth.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:38.240
Others have accepted our magazines

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:43.319
for many years, many years,

00:24:43.319 --> 00:24:45.359
and they've never done a thing about the truth.

00:24:47.559 --> 00:24:50.480
But they're still going back.

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:53.759
You know, coming back from the Deus service,

00:24:53.759 --> 00:24:55.480
how many magazines do you place?

00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:00.079
Now they mean, well, God loves us, but excuse me.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.640
That's not the focus of our work.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.960
It has to refocus on what we're all about.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.880
And just think about it.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:15.400
Jesus commanded, go there for and make disciples

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.640
of people, of all the nations.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.880
We don't have the authority to change

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.480
what they had of the congregation has said,

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.640
and go along the lines of,

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.799
go there for and place a lot of literature.

00:25:30.119 --> 00:25:32.240
That's not our focus.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.519
Even though it's the best on the planet,

00:25:34.519 --> 00:25:38.599
we're about searching for the rightly disposed,

00:25:38.599 --> 00:25:41.200
so they can become disciples of Christ.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:45.799
And these ones that have taken our literature for years,

00:25:46.799 --> 00:25:49.640
and you know, as we said, individuals might change.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:52.640
They remind us of what happened in Ezekiel's day,

00:25:53.559 --> 00:25:58.559
and some of you are Bible readers, scholars, if you will,

00:25:58.759 --> 00:26:01.680
but let's read it anyway in Ezekiel 33,

00:26:02.839 --> 00:26:06.599
and find what he faced, and we face this.

00:26:06.599 --> 00:26:08.359
It's a reality.

00:26:08.359 --> 00:26:11.319
So given the limited time,

00:26:11.319 --> 00:26:13.160
we have to make sure,

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:16.400
and Jehovah's Spirit's moving us this way,

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.119
that we accept this as the way it is,

00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:22.519
our day as well.

00:26:22.519 --> 00:26:25.480
Now notice verse 31 of Ezekiel 33,

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.119
31 and 32,

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:33.440
they will crown in to sit before you as my people,

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.799
and they will hear your words, but they will not do them.

00:26:37.799 --> 00:26:39.519
For worth their mouth, they flatter you,

00:26:39.519 --> 00:26:43.039
but their heart is greedy for dishonest gain,

00:26:43.039 --> 00:26:47.079
look, you order them like a romantic love song,

00:26:47.079 --> 00:26:49.559
sung with a beautiful voice,

00:26:49.559 --> 00:26:52.759
and skillfully played on a stringed instrument.

00:26:52.759 --> 00:26:55.559
They will hear your words,

00:26:55.559 --> 00:26:58.680
but no one will act on them.

00:27:00.119 --> 00:27:02.640
That's every territory,

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.119
and if you've worked it for many years,

00:27:06.119 --> 00:27:09.519
you can have faces come to mind, just like that.

00:27:10.519 --> 00:27:13.160
Come to occasional meetings and such.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.960
Well, time's running out.

00:27:16.519 --> 00:27:18.920
God's making that very clear to us.

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:22.000
We need to help people come into the truth.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.920
We don't need the flattery and such,

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.559
and that kind of experience.

00:27:27.559 --> 00:27:30.759
This is a time for decision,

00:27:30.759 --> 00:27:35.000
or looking for people that will act on what they learn.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.519
That's where our blows are gonna be effective.

00:27:38.519 --> 00:27:40.920
People have to act on it.

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:44.039
And if you're not seeing that, just get searching,

00:27:45.039 --> 00:27:47.359
and let the angels and Jehovah's spirit

00:27:47.359 --> 00:27:50.880
take you to the rightly disposed ones.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.119
And something that we forget,

00:27:53.119 --> 00:27:55.599
our work is twofold.

00:27:55.599 --> 00:27:57.160
We can forget that sometimes.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:02.160
We're searching and bringing in the rightly disposed,

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.680
and the others, we're praising and honoring

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:08.160
your Jehovah, like Brother Loishmensen,

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:12.039
because they're hearing about Jehovah's Judgment Day.

00:28:12.039 --> 00:28:12.960
So it's twofold.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:13.960
It's a warning warning.

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.640
You could go a whole morning,

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.240
and I have what you thought was, in fact, a day,

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.640
no literature, but you praise God,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.920
because they're still thinking about Jehovah's Witnesses

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:28.359
and your efforts to preach in that territory.

00:28:28.359 --> 00:28:31.960
So, gotta keep that in mind.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.880
So that's the one problem.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:39.569
And here's problem too, that we wanna address.

00:28:39.569 --> 00:28:43.329
We have so many tools to use in the ministry.

00:28:43.329 --> 00:28:46.730
It can be overwhelming and confusing,

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:48.329
even to the best minds.

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:53.730
So, your older ones don't feel slip in here.

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:55.690
I'm confused, no.

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:59.130
The young ones are trying to, often,

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:01.049
overwhelmed and confused.

00:29:01.049 --> 00:29:04.289
So our teaching toolbox that we emphasize

00:29:04.289 --> 00:29:06.569
in recent years, what happened

00:29:06.569 --> 00:29:13.289
is it became a huge tool shed.

00:29:13.289 --> 00:29:15.769
You know, a lot of your non-year hits, it's okay.

00:29:15.769 --> 00:29:17.529
That's not disloyal, it's true.

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:21.250
It's become a huge tool shed.

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:23.769
Now, we appreciate the sample presentations

00:29:23.769 --> 00:29:28.009
at the midweek meaning, frankly, many of us are so busy,

00:29:28.009 --> 00:29:31.410
we can't keep up with all the latest presentations.

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:34.130
No matter how good they are, oh, that was good.

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:36.970
And then Saturday morning or Sunday, okay,

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:38.450
what am I doing today?

00:29:40.049 --> 00:29:42.210
We had three of them in our midweek meeting.

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:45.690
I don't know what am I supposed to do here.

00:29:46.529 --> 00:29:49.730
And then if you got a critic nearby, you know,

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:51.089
oh, Lauren, you know.

00:29:54.089 --> 00:29:57.690
Plus, many struggled to keep up with reading

00:29:57.690 --> 00:29:59.009
all the magazines.

00:29:59.849 --> 00:30:01.250
You're not a bad person.

00:30:02.329 --> 00:30:06.930
Jehovah loves you, we understand.

00:30:08.609 --> 00:30:12.529
So, in view of this, the governing bodies

00:30:12.529 --> 00:30:15.970
are adjusting the focus of our ministry.

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:19.049
You're getting the message, addressing these two problems.

00:30:19.049 --> 00:30:23.569
And we are 100% with this unanimous.

00:30:23.569 --> 00:30:27.170
Everybody in the departments connected are with it.

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:30.410
They can sense Jehovah's spirit, moving it.

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:31.930
This is what Jehovah's doing.

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:34.730
It's his chariot, he's the driver.

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:38.210
So, here's the adjustments.

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:43.930
Starting January 2018, there will only be three

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:46.049
public editions of the watchtower.

00:30:53.009 --> 00:30:56.690
For those that are tied in, I heard some expressions

00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:59.890
that are down in front here and couldn't help it.

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:03.569
Only three public editions of the watchtower

00:31:03.569 --> 00:31:07.930
and three of the awake magazines, the whole year.

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:12.569
See, yeah, I'm excited too.

00:31:12.569 --> 00:31:16.369
I'm really, yeah.

00:31:16.369 --> 00:31:20.329
Now, in what's beautiful about this,

00:31:20.329 --> 00:31:23.849
they're going to cover one subject in the whole magazine.

00:31:23.849 --> 00:31:28.769
Start to finish, say, one subject.

00:31:28.769 --> 00:31:35.900
Now, I have here a hard copy of the first one.

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:37.140
So, I'm excited about it.

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:40.980
And, in my view, these are special.

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:42.099
This one is special.

00:31:42.099 --> 00:31:43.619
It's the first one.

00:31:43.619 --> 00:31:45.700
And Jehovah's moving it toward

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:48.500
those rightly disposed forever lasting life.

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.500
Because he knows his day and hour.

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:56.579
And this one is quite easy to start a conversation

00:31:56.579 --> 00:31:58.660
with, and once you have a question,

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:00.819
you're in a conversation already.

00:32:00.819 --> 00:32:03.099
So, whether it's, get off my porch

00:32:03.099 --> 00:32:07.900
or they want to get involved in the answering of that question,

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.740
it's effective.

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:12.460
And the rightly disposed are going to be intrigued.

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:14.859
The first one, this question here,

00:32:14.859 --> 00:32:20.859
is the Bible still relevant today?

00:32:20.859 --> 00:32:23.059
Certain territories?

00:32:23.059 --> 00:32:24.220
Maybe not.

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:27.900
But there may be righteously disposed ones there.

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.220
You have a nice cover picture.

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:31.819
A woman in the back reading her Bible

00:32:31.819 --> 00:32:33.339
is the train's going by.

00:32:33.339 --> 00:32:38.339
People distracted with their watches, their phones, et cetera.

00:32:38.339 --> 00:32:41.059
And then, on the inside,

00:32:41.059 --> 00:32:42.940
and you're going to become familiar with this,

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:46.460
you've got plenty of time to use it, this tool,

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:47.819
over and over, oh yeah.

00:32:47.819 --> 00:32:49.420
You'll know right where to go.

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:53.019
You might decide, well, I'll go,

00:32:53.019 --> 00:32:56.099
where comments are outdated or ahead of its time,

00:32:56.099 --> 00:32:58.740
depending on what the person may have said.

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:01.220
You have that freedom.

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:04.619
So appropriate, help to avoid problems,

00:33:04.619 --> 00:33:09.940
help to resolve problems, help to cope with problems.

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.819
Boy do people need that.

00:33:11.819 --> 00:33:17.380
And those that are rightly disposed for everlasting life,

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:19.180
know they have problems.

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:20.940
They're honest about it.

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:24.980
And so this will touch their heart and Jehovah will draw them.

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.380
Now, what's nice about it is that you're

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:30.339
going to be able to get very familiar with it,

00:33:30.339 --> 00:33:35.059
use it, and it'll become part of our permanent teaching

00:33:35.059 --> 00:33:36.859
toolbox.

00:33:36.859 --> 00:33:40.259
See, and it'll go in the teaching toolbox.

00:33:40.259 --> 00:33:41.900
Even like these skilled craftsmen,

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:43.740
they have their toolbox.

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:46.740
Why are they so good at what they do in many cases?

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:49.980
Because they keep using these tools.

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:51.940
It's not rocket science.

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:54.819
These are craftsmen with these tools.

00:33:54.819 --> 00:33:58.859
I need this, I need that to accomplish what they need here.

00:33:58.859 --> 00:34:02.380
So we only need so many tools in the box.

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:06.140
The ones that we can get, very good at using.

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:10.900
And what's nice when it's in the permanent teaching toolbox

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:15.420
there, you're not changing all the time.

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:18.980
And was all that sincere, yes?

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:22.460
But I could tell you stories, but times

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:26.300
running out of some of the things I've heard out in the ministry.

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:31.940
I could tell they never read that.

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:33.179
But they're out there.

00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:34.019
God love them.

00:34:34.019 --> 00:34:37.460
They were knocking on doors with me.

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:39.539
You get familiar with the tool.

00:34:39.539 --> 00:34:44.619
Now, what we'll do will evaluate after two years.

00:34:44.619 --> 00:34:46.900
And it might be, so you're at the governing body,

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:51.019
decides that we think we've got sufficient subjects

00:34:51.019 --> 00:34:54.460
in the magazines for the toolbox.

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:56.860
And then we'll just reprint.

00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:59.980
It's already been written.

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:02.340
So you've got your tools.

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:04.340
Now, you're going to get more details

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:07.539
on the teaching toolbox soon.

00:35:07.539 --> 00:35:11.380
And you'll also be pleased to know this,

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:13.659
that the brother's been working hard on this.

00:35:13.659 --> 00:35:17.739
He's going to be an update on the box, teaching toolbox,

00:35:17.739 --> 00:35:18.980
and the JW library.

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:21.860
And we love the JW library.

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:24.179
It'll be on the homepage there.

00:35:24.179 --> 00:35:27.380
That'll be happening in the near future.

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:29.260
And this question will arise now,

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:30.659
because territories are different.

00:35:30.659 --> 00:35:32.420
We understand that.

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:35.860
What if you find that the teaching toolbox

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:38.420
doesn't contain a tool that you have found effective

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:41.860
in your territory, like a video that you think

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:46.139
is, and you've experienced effectiveness with it?

00:35:46.139 --> 00:35:47.460
It's OK.

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:50.780
Put it in your favorite section.

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:54.099
So don't write in and say, I think

00:35:54.099 --> 00:35:56.619
that should be in the teaching toolbox.

00:35:56.619 --> 00:36:00.420
We've gone through all of this at headquarters.

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:01.780
It's OK.

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:05.300
But you go ahead and put it in your favorite section

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:06.179
and use it.

00:36:06.179 --> 00:36:07.780
Not a problem.

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:10.300
Not a problem.

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:13.780
Now, so that's covered those with the preaching

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:16.059
and the focus of our ministry.

00:36:16.059 --> 00:36:19.900
And there's another adjustment that I've

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:23.019
been asked to announce here.

00:36:23.019 --> 00:36:27.500
We all enjoy the latest reports on the worldwide work

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:32.739
that we have on JW.org and JW Broadcasting.

00:36:32.739 --> 00:36:33.860
We love it.

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:36.539
And I know recently, so in time, they didn't

00:36:36.539 --> 00:36:38.340
know about Venezuela.

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:40.739
Well, it was on JW.org, but you don't

00:36:40.739 --> 00:36:43.659
want to try and make it feel bad.

00:36:43.659 --> 00:36:47.019
But there's so much we're getting all throughout the year.

00:36:47.019 --> 00:36:49.940
And it's timely and a blessing.

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:52.820
So with this in mind, the governing body

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:55.659
has decided that with all of the information

00:36:55.659 --> 00:37:01.980
on JW.org and JW Broadcast, that as of 2018,

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:06.099
we will no longer produce the yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:37:06.099 --> 00:37:08.260
especially been the truth a long time.

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:10.099
Yes?

00:37:10.099 --> 00:37:13.940
The 2017 is your last one.

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:14.820
So that's a story.

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:20.750
But OK, mine.

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:25.829
Try to convince me you've seen everything we've put on JW.org

00:37:25.829 --> 00:37:28.789
and JW Broadcast.

00:37:28.789 --> 00:37:32.349
See, God's watching.

00:37:32.349 --> 00:37:34.469
You're well fed, you've got plenty there.

00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:42.590
These latest developments that are indeed exciting.

00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:46.670
And as the end, fast approaches, let's honor Jehovah

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:49.150
and make our blows count.

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:52.469
Let's go forth and make disciples of people

00:37:52.469 --> 00:38:09.949
that are righteously disposed forever lasting life.

00:38:09.949 --> 00:38:12.150
What an exciting announcement.

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:14.949
I don't know about you, but I'm really excited about this

00:38:14.949 --> 00:38:18.829
because we can see the end is so close.

00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:20.750
And really, isn't the main thing

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:22.469
that we should be thinking about

00:38:22.469 --> 00:38:24.670
is helping people to know Jehovah.

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:26.190
That's the prime goal.

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:28.469
So the governing body is helping us

00:38:28.469 --> 00:38:30.349
to see how to have this toolbox.

00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:34.269
We're all looking forward to see what's in the toolbox.

00:38:34.269 --> 00:38:37.110
In addition to that, we've got a few other announcements

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:38.070
to make.

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:40.389
We'd like to inform you of some changes

00:38:40.389 --> 00:38:43.469
that are planned with regard to the study edition

00:38:43.469 --> 00:38:45.150
of the Watchdown.

00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:48.269
Now, since 2011, in English, we've

00:38:48.269 --> 00:38:50.670
been producing two different versions

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:52.829
of the study edition.

00:38:52.829 --> 00:38:56.269
We've had the standard edition and the simplified.

00:38:56.269 --> 00:39:00.309
And each of those has filled a vital need.

00:39:00.309 --> 00:39:03.190
However, in recent months, the governing body

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:06.670
has asked the writing committee to investigate ways

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:11.630
to simplify the style of the standard edition.

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:12.989
Additionally, the governing body

00:39:12.989 --> 00:39:17.469
has approved a new design for the standard edition,

00:39:17.469 --> 00:39:20.789
which allows for a larger font style

00:39:20.789 --> 00:39:23.590
and also has certain features that are only

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:27.150
in the simplified edition, such as some expressions

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:29.030
explained.

00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:31.429
So with this in mind, the governing body

00:39:31.429 --> 00:39:36.230
has decided as of January 1, 2019,

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:39.949
they're going to combine both versions of the magazines.

00:39:39.949 --> 00:39:42.389
This will not only simplify our work,

00:39:42.389 --> 00:39:44.590
it'll also be less confusing.

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:48.190
And we all will have the same magazine that we're using.

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:50.070
Now, you'll be interested to note

00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:52.829
that many of the larger languages that

00:39:52.829 --> 00:39:56.349
were producing two editions, languages such as Spanish,

00:39:56.349 --> 00:39:58.429
Portuguese, French, and Italian,

00:39:58.429 --> 00:40:01.909
have recently already combined their editions,

00:40:01.909 --> 00:40:04.550
trying to simplify the language used

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:06.190
in their standard edition.

00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:08.469
And this has been very successful.

00:40:08.469 --> 00:40:11.909
We will continue to produce an electronic version

00:40:11.909 --> 00:40:14.550
of the English Simplifiers magazine.

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:17.590
And that will be used mainly by translators

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:21.230
to help them to make sure their translation is still clear

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:23.710
and understandable.

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:25.949
Now, in addition, we'd like to let

00:40:25.949 --> 00:40:28.630
you know that early next year, we'll

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:31.510
be receiving a new publication.

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:36.710
And it will be one of the ones that we use in the toolbox.

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:41.389
It is called How to Remain in God's Love.

00:40:41.389 --> 00:40:43.829
And you see it here on the screen.

00:40:43.829 --> 00:40:47.030
It's 256 pages.

00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:52.510
And it uses the same simplified style as the TCHAS book.

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:56.630
So it's going to replace the current God's Love book.

00:40:56.630 --> 00:41:00.829
These two publications, that is How to Remain in God's Love

00:41:00.829 --> 00:41:05.710
and the TCHAS books, will be used in the toolbox

00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:08.949
for helping students to become disciples.

00:41:08.949 --> 00:41:19.300
You look forward to getting that.

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:22.019
Well, I know we'll be going away from here,

00:41:22.019 --> 00:41:23.940
minds and hearts spinning around,

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:28.059
thinking of all the interesting changes and developments.
