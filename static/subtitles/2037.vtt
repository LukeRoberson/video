00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.780
An introduction to the book of Leviticus.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:12.779
Leviticus was written by Moses in 1512 BCE in the wilderness of Sinai.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:20.780
The name Leviticus, later given to the book, comes from a Greek word meaning pertaining to the Levites.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:27.780
Yet the book was written not for the Levites alone, but for the entire nation of Israel.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:37.780
Leviticus covers a period of about one month, describing the events immediately following the construction of the Tabernacle.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:45.780
Leviticus focuses on Jehovah's holiness and the holiness of his people by their obedience to his statutes.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:54.060
Chapters 1-7 set out the various laws about offerings to Jehovah.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.060
Chapters 8-9 cover the installation of the priesthood.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:06.060
The anointing of Aaron is high priest, and Aaron's first offerings to God.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:18.060
In chapter 10, Jehovah puts to death two of Aaron's sons, the priests Nehdeb and Abihu, for offering unauthorized fire or incense.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:27.060
Jehovah then issues the command that priests must not drink alcohol before entering the tent of meeting or tabernacle.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.060
Chapters 11-15 set out laws about cleanness and uncleanness.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.060
In regard to food, Jehovah tells the Israelites which creatures they may and may not eat.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.060
Instructions regarding the day of atonement are given in chapter 16.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.060
Chapter 17-20 contain laws on holy conduct.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:02:01.060
For example, God's people must not eat blood or engage in any form of idolatry or spiritism as the nations around them were doing.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:10.060
They should show consideration for the blind, the deaf, and the foreign resident, and they should treat the elderly with respect.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.740
Did you know?

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:23.740
The arrangements mentioned in the book of Leviticus were a shadow of the good things to come, as explained in the book of Hebrews.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.740
For example, the high priest typifies Jesus Christ.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.740
The blood of the animal sacrifices foreshadows the blood of Jesus.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:45.009
The most holy of the tabernacle represents heaven itself, where Jesus appeared before God on our behalf.

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:49.009
Chapters 21 and 22 set out rules for the priesthood.

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:56.009
For example, those serving as priests must be sound in body having no physical defects.

00:02:56.009 --> 00:03:03.009
Chapters 23 and 24 have instructions about festivals and holy days.

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:11.009
Jehovah also provides directions regarding the lamps in the tabernacle and the ring-shaped loaves of showbred.

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:16.009
Chapter 24 also highlights the sacredness of God's name.

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:22.419
At Jehovah's command, a man who cursed that name is stoned to death.

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:33.419
Chapter 25 contains laws about the Sabbath year, the Jubilee year, the restoration of property, and the treatment of the poor.

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:40.419
Those who are sold into slavery must be treated kindly as hired workers.

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:49.419
Chapter 26 spells out the blessings of obedience to Jehovah and the punishments for disobedience.

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:57.419
Chapter 27 closes the book of Leviticus with laws about things vowed to Jehovah and things devoted to Him.

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:08.229
As you read the book of Leviticus, note how we should strive to be holy in imitation of Jehovah.

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:11.229
Why we should deeply respect His holy name?

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:22.230
And why we can have confidence that the entire earth will reflect God's holiness under the rule of His Son, the great high priest and king of God's kingdom?
