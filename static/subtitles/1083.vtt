WEBVTT

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:08.230
Greetings brothers and sisters, our next music video presentation is about to begin.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:14.630
As you watch it, please reflect on how our faithfulness now will lead to even greater

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.269
joy in the future.

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:22.710
If you have a mobile phone or another electronic device, please adjust it to a setting that

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.710
will not disturb others.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.379
And now, enjoy the presentation.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:10:55.909
Welcome to this session of our Always Rejoice Convention, which corresponds to this Sunday

00:10:55.909 --> 00:10:59.389
morning session on your printed program.

00:10:59.389 --> 00:11:08.029
The theme is taken from Psalm 37 verse 4, which tells us, find exquisite delight in Jehovah

00:11:08.029 --> 00:11:13.539
and he will grant you the desires of your heart.

00:11:13.539 --> 00:11:18.379
We invite you to stand as we sing together song number 22.

00:11:18.379 --> 00:11:21.059
The kingdom is in place.

00:11:21.059 --> 00:11:22.860
Let it come.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.620
After the song, you may pause the program for your local opening prayer.

00:11:26.620 --> 00:14:11.909
Again, that's song number 22.

00:14:11.909 --> 00:14:14.470
You may be seated.

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:19.350
Is it possible to rejoice even when dealing with severe trials?

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:22.429
The Bible assures us that it is.

00:14:22.429 --> 00:14:28.710
This morning's seven parts symposium will explain how Jehovah helps us to do so.

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:31.789
Each speaker will introduce the one to follow.

00:14:31.789 --> 00:14:38.110
To begin, let's give our attention to brother Kenneth Lodin, a helper to the teaching committee

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:52.759
as he presents the first talk entitled Re-Can Rejoice Despite Tribulation.

00:14:52.759 --> 00:15:00.600
Did you notice in each of the titles of our symposium talks, it uses the word despite.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.679
The English word despite can mean without being blocked or thwarted.

00:15:04.679 --> 00:15:10.039
So, our ability to rejoice will not be blocked or thwarted.

00:15:10.039 --> 00:15:13.679
We can actually rejoice despite trials.

00:15:14.679 --> 00:15:18.440
Well, initially that sounds contradictory, doesn't it?

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:25.639
I usually associate with rejoicing the receiving of gifts, not trials.

00:15:25.639 --> 00:15:28.320
And yet that is the very point.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:34.039
We can rejoice despite trials because of gifts that Jehovah provides for us.

00:15:34.039 --> 00:15:37.600
And we're going to review three of those in our symposium.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:43.120
Our relationship with Jehovah, our precious brotherhood,

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.320
and the glorious hope we have for the future.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:54.360
Please turn with me to Romans chapter five, verses three through five.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:16:00.559
And see if you can identify when this first gift is introduced in the verses,

00:16:00.559 --> 00:16:04.440
a relationship with Jehovah, Romans five, three through five.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:09.720
It says not only that, but let us rejoice while in tribulations,

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:14.279
since we know that tribulation produces endurance, endurance in turn,

00:16:14.279 --> 00:16:19.360
and a proof condition, one approved condition with whom.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.960
It's with Jehovah.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.879
It says the approved condition in turn, hope,

00:16:23.879 --> 00:16:27.600
and the hope does not lead to disappointment and why not?

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.679
Because of this relationship with Jehovah,

00:16:29.679 --> 00:16:34.240
it says because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:38.759
through the Holy Spirit, which was given to us.

00:16:38.759 --> 00:16:43.159
Yes, when we endure trials, we can sense Jehovah's approval.

00:16:43.159 --> 00:16:47.600
And that helps us to rejoice despite the hardship.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.759
Now find Romans 838 and 39.

00:16:50.759 --> 00:16:54.720
As you know, Paul experienced one trial after the other.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:59.919
And yet he was convinced that no trial could distance him from Jehovah,

00:16:59.919 --> 00:17:05.240
could separate him from God's love and abiding relationship.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.079
Romans 838 and 39.

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:12.680
It says, for I am convinced that neither death nor life,

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:16.319
nor angels, nor governments, nor things now here,

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:21.079
nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth.

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:25.279
And then he says, nor any other creation will be able to separate us

00:17:25.279 --> 00:17:29.160
from God's love that's in Christ Jesus, our Lord.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:35.359
Our relationship with God can help us in times of trial.

00:17:35.359 --> 00:17:37.319
But how about the second gift from Jehovah?

00:17:37.319 --> 00:17:39.480
First Peter 5.9.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.160
First Peter 5.9.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.960
Satan tries to capitalize on our trials.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.960
But notice the admonition here in verse 9.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:52.720
It says, but take your stand against him, firm in the faith.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.640
And what will help?

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:57.200
It says knowing that the same kind of suffering,

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:01.759
so trials are being experienced by the entire association

00:18:01.759 --> 00:18:04.279
of your brothers in the world.

00:18:04.279 --> 00:18:06.960
While we have felt that trust,

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.480
the support from our brotherhood,

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.640
particularly these last six months or so,

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.640
we've sensed it so clearly.

00:18:13.599 --> 00:18:16.119
Romans 1212 is our third gift from Jehovah,

00:18:16.119 --> 00:18:18.440
a provision to help us to endure trials.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:23.759
Romans 1212 and it says it, so very crystal clear.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.599
It says rejoice in the hope.

00:18:28.519 --> 00:18:31.480
And then it adds, endure under tribulation,

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.599
persevere in prayer.

00:18:34.359 --> 00:18:36.920
So our relationship with Jehovah,

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:40.279
the brotherhood and our hope can help us

00:18:40.279 --> 00:18:42.240
deal with these circumstances.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.480
And it might vary depending on circumstance.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.279
Just as an example, a brother in prison might have

00:18:48.279 --> 00:18:51.079
no access at all to the brotherhood.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.799
So what sustains him?

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:57.200
Well, in that case, it would be his relationship with Jehovah.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.240
You may be remembering Brother Harold King on JW Broadcasting.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.920
For four and a half years,

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.240
he was in solitary confinement in a Chinese prison.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.799
But was he really all alone?

00:19:10.799 --> 00:19:12.319
The authority stopped so.

00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:18.319
But he had the best cellmate anyone would ever want.

00:19:18.319 --> 00:19:20.480
He said in his video interview,

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.440
he said, I had a lovely relationship with Jehovah.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.279
I loved him very dearly.

00:19:26.279 --> 00:19:27.480
He was real.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:29.240
He wasn't fictitious.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.319
Yes, Brother King was able to rejoice under that trial

00:19:33.319 --> 00:19:37.079
because he had developed that real relationship with his God.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:42.799
Another example, a depressed brother or sister

00:19:42.799 --> 00:19:47.000
may be struggling to maintain his relationship with God.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.839
While there's another gift from Jehovah

00:19:48.839 --> 00:19:50.400
that can come into play,

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.960
he may be supported by one or more of the brotherhood.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:57.200
It's like a person who's fighting to breathe properly.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:02.519
He's still alive, but he's struggling to hold on.

00:20:02.519 --> 00:20:05.440
But then, income is a support of a medical team

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.160
and he begins functioning normally again

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.119
and breathing properly.

00:20:10.119 --> 00:20:13.440
Our brotherhood can come to our aid and support

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.960
when we're suffering depression or some other serious trial.

00:20:18.079 --> 00:20:22.759
Well, how can our hope help us to rejoice despite the trial?

00:20:23.759 --> 00:20:27.160
Another example, some of us have Christian parents

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.400
who are now old and incapacitated in some way.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.960
And that's a trial for us.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:37.160
It might be like a loved one having a bad accident.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.079
And now he's laid up in a hospital bed.

00:20:40.079 --> 00:20:42.480
He can't take care of himself.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.960
But then the doctor comes in and says,

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.640
he's gonna have a full recovery.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.680
Wow, that gives us hope.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.480
It's similar with our elderly parents

00:20:52.599 --> 00:20:54.519
because of our sure hope of the future.

00:20:54.519 --> 00:20:56.200
It's like Jehovah saying,

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.880
they're gonna have a full recovery

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.519
from the ravages of old age.

00:21:00.519 --> 00:21:03.559
Yes, hope helps us to rejoice.

00:21:03.559 --> 00:21:05.519
Whatever our situation or trial,

00:21:05.519 --> 00:21:08.400
we can be sure that one or more of these provisions

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:12.079
will help us suffer through the hardship with joy.

00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:19.339
I invite you to find now Romans chapter eight.

00:21:19.339 --> 00:21:23.099
Romans chapter eight, we're gonna look at verse 35 and 37.

00:21:24.099 --> 00:21:26.819
In this symposium, we're gonna be considering

00:21:26.819 --> 00:21:30.299
each of the seven trials mentioned in verse 35.

00:21:30.299 --> 00:21:31.779
Please identify them with me.

00:21:31.779 --> 00:21:33.299
Romans eight, 35.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:38.660
It says, who will separate us from the love of the Christ?

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:41.619
Well, number one, tribulation, number two, distress

00:21:41.619 --> 00:21:44.380
or persecution or hunger or nakedness

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:46.460
or danger or sword?

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:47.900
That's the seven.

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:49.660
But now look at verse 37, it says,

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:51.740
on the contrary, in all these things,

00:21:51.819 --> 00:21:53.900
all seven of them, we are coming off

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:57.660
completely victorious through the one who loved us.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:02.579
Well, each symposium talk will include a video

00:22:02.579 --> 00:22:06.700
of a brother or sister who experienced a trial,

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.099
a severe one.

00:22:08.099 --> 00:22:12.339
And we will identify which of these gifts help them

00:22:12.339 --> 00:22:14.740
to rejoice despite the tribulation.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:18.779
Well, let's consider that first one that Paul addressed,

00:22:18.779 --> 00:22:20.700
it's called tribulation.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:24.259
Tribulation refers to suffering caused by some trying

00:22:24.259 --> 00:22:29.259
situation, possibly a debilitating illness.

00:22:29.619 --> 00:22:36.019
Turn with me to second Corinthians chapter 12.

00:22:36.019 --> 00:22:38.539
Second Corinthians 12, we're gonna look at verse 7 and 8.

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:42.819
This tribulation was vexing to Paul so much

00:22:42.819 --> 00:22:45.220
so that he called it a thorn and his flesh.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:47.940
Second Corinthians 12, 7 and 8, it says,

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.740
to keep me from becoming overly exalted,

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.339
I was given a thorn and the flesh.

00:22:53.339 --> 00:22:56.579
An angel was Satan to keep slapping me

00:22:56.579 --> 00:22:59.140
so that I might not be overly exalted.

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:01.740
Three times I begged the Lord about this

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.460
that it would depart from me.

00:23:04.779 --> 00:23:05.900
A thorn and the flesh.

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:09.339
So this obviously was a physical melody

00:23:09.339 --> 00:23:11.700
and he said it kept slapping him.

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.779
So it was continuing on.

00:23:13.779 --> 00:23:16.700
It wasn't just like the common cold or flu

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.619
and were better in a week or so.

00:23:18.619 --> 00:23:21.460
This was continual, it was a chronic trial

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.859
for him to deal with.

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:24.380
And based on the scriptures,

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.180
it's thought that it may have been a serious

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:29.619
degeneration of his eyesight.

00:23:29.619 --> 00:23:32.859
Well, that would have been very disconcerning to Paul.

00:23:32.859 --> 00:23:36.019
In fact, he prayed three times that it would be gone,

00:23:36.019 --> 00:23:37.619
take it away from me.

00:23:37.619 --> 00:23:39.380
And remember, they did not have eyeglasses

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.380
with corrective lenses back then.

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.819
No eye surgery was available.

00:23:43.819 --> 00:23:47.420
So this was a chronic tribulation.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:50.700
And think about this, by means of Holy Spirit,

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:54.019
Paul had on a number of occasions cured people

00:23:54.019 --> 00:23:55.819
of their sickness.

00:23:55.819 --> 00:23:57.660
So he could have easily wondered,

00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:59.460
where is this gift of the Holy Spirit?

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:02.299
When I need it, I need a cure.

00:24:02.299 --> 00:24:04.420
Well, what helped Paul to rejoice

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:06.700
despite his tribulation?

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.700
It was as close a biting relationship with Jehovah.

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:12.339
If you still have 2 Corinthians 12 there,

00:24:12.339 --> 00:24:14.140
let's read together verse nine.

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:17.579
And this is where Jehovah tells Paul

00:24:18.579 --> 00:24:21.660
you will have no miraculous cure.

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:23.420
Verse nine.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.180
But he said to me,

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:28.059
my undies are kindness is sufficient for you.

00:24:28.059 --> 00:24:31.700
For my power is being made perfect in weakness.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.819
Jehovah says no cure.

00:24:33.819 --> 00:24:35.380
But I'm going to give you the power

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:38.859
to continue on despite the tribulation.

00:24:38.859 --> 00:24:41.940
Well, notice the relationship that Paul evidently has

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:45.700
with Jehovah the last part of that verse.

00:24:45.819 --> 00:24:47.740
He says, most gladly then,

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.099
I will boast about my weaknesses

00:24:50.099 --> 00:24:52.859
in order that the power of the Christ

00:24:52.859 --> 00:24:55.339
may remain over me like a tent.

00:24:55.339 --> 00:24:58.660
He rejoiced in the strength from Jehovah.

00:24:58.660 --> 00:24:59.779
Look at verse 10.

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:02.740
He says, so I take pleasure

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:05.859
and we could substitute the word rejoice,

00:25:05.859 --> 00:25:08.140
a rejoice in weaknesses,

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.700
in insults, in times of need,

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:13.779
in persecutions and difficulties for Christ.

00:25:13.779 --> 00:25:17.579
For when I am weak, then I am powerful.

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.339
Well, we weren't going to watch a video

00:25:20.339 --> 00:25:23.900
and this is an example of tribulation.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:28.420
What helped this brother and his wife

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:30.220
to rejoice under tribulation

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:41.859
in the form of a serious illness?

00:25:41.859 --> 00:25:43.859
For the last 45 years,

00:25:43.859 --> 00:25:46.180
I've been pioneer work,

00:25:47.299 --> 00:25:48.539
traveling work,

00:25:49.539 --> 00:25:53.539
and being in Bethel here for a number of years.

00:25:53.539 --> 00:25:57.819
Health was very good.

00:25:57.819 --> 00:26:00.819
Never had any problems at all.

00:26:00.819 --> 00:26:04.859
One day I had a headache.

00:26:04.859 --> 00:26:06.859
It was severe.

00:26:06.859 --> 00:26:10.859
I really couldn't see clearly anything.

00:26:10.859 --> 00:26:14.299
We went to the Bethel doctor

00:26:14.299 --> 00:26:16.299
and he referred us to a specialist

00:26:16.299 --> 00:26:19.299
and a specialist gave us diagnosis

00:26:19.299 --> 00:26:21.299
of a very aggressive brain tumor

00:26:22.299 --> 00:26:26.380
called glioblastoma.

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:31.369
He had surgery the next Thursday.

00:26:31.369 --> 00:26:34.369
Then after surgery, he had radiation

00:26:34.369 --> 00:26:38.809
and chemotherapy at the same time.

00:26:38.809 --> 00:26:41.809
A year later, he had to have another surgery

00:26:41.809 --> 00:26:44.809
and he is right now on his fourth type

00:26:44.809 --> 00:26:46.809
of chemotherapy treatment.

00:26:46.809 --> 00:26:51.859
From the very first time he got sick,

00:26:51.859 --> 00:26:54.859
the hardest thing was to see my husband

00:26:54.859 --> 00:26:57.859
become increasingly dependent upon me

00:26:58.859 --> 00:27:03.099
and upon other people.

00:27:03.099 --> 00:27:06.099
I didn't want this to define who we are.

00:27:06.099 --> 00:27:11.980
The brothers played a pivotal role

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:13.980
in trying to help us

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:17.980
when found out that I had to go in for surgery,

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:19.980
gave me a scripture

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:22.980
and we prayed together

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.980
and I'll always remember that.

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:26.980
It was a beautiful example

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:31.670
and I also get a lot of encouragement

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:35.670
from Sarah who gets us prepared for meetings.

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:39.690
When we go out in service,

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:42.690
I've gotten an opportunity to go

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:45.690
and help people just talk to them

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:47.690
and encourage them.

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:53.779
In my Bethel assignment

00:27:53.779 --> 00:27:55.779
in the service department,

00:27:55.779 --> 00:27:57.779
I have a brother or two

00:27:57.779 --> 00:28:00.779
who will come over and review a case

00:28:00.779 --> 00:28:02.779
that we're considering

00:28:02.779 --> 00:28:06.779
and I get a lot of joy in that way.

00:28:07.779 --> 00:28:10.779
I'm very thankful that I can still do

00:28:10.779 --> 00:28:12.779
a little something to help.

00:28:12.779 --> 00:28:18.660
For me, because he's been humbled

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:19.660
through this whole thing,

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:23.619
it's been easier.

00:28:23.619 --> 00:28:25.619
My hope is strong

00:28:25.619 --> 00:28:28.619
and I'm going to keep right on going this way

00:28:28.619 --> 00:28:30.619
and serve Jehovah right

00:28:30.619 --> 00:28:33.619
onto the New World or whatever comes.

00:28:33.619 --> 00:28:38.630
Obviously, Scott and Sarah Schofner

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:41.630
had a good relationship with Jehovah

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:44.630
and Sarah supported Scott wonderfully.

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:48.630
But do you notice the additional gift from Jehovah?

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:50.630
Scott said the brotherhood

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:53.630
played a pivotal role in helping them.

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:55.630
He remembered a specific scripture

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:58.630
and a prayer that was shared before his surgery.

00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:59.630
And young brothers came in

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:01.630
and helped him with his assignment afterward.

00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:02.630
In his own words,

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:05.630
he said that brought him a lot of joy.

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:08.630
Joy, despite tribulation.

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:10.630
So how about you?

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:12.630
Which of the provisions from Jehovah

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:14.630
is boying you up

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:18.630
as you deal with your particular trial or tribulation?

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:20.630
Your relationship with Jehovah?

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:22.630
Is it the brotherhood, your hope,

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:25.630
or maybe some other gift from God?

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:28.630
If you're stressed under tribulation,

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:29.630
remember this.

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:32.630
It's as if Jehovah is watching the monitor

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:36.630
and he sees us in pain of heart

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:38.630
but he reassures us as,

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:41.630
you're going to be okay.

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:42.630
So no matter the pain,

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:43.630
no matter the tribulation may,

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:47.630
we remember those words in Romans chapter 8,

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:50.630
verse 37 and 39.

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:52.630
In all these things,

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:54.630
we are coming off completely victorious

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:56.630
through the one who loved us.

00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:57.630
And verse 39,

00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:59.630
it's saying nothing.

00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:00.630
Nothing.

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:03.630
No tribulation will be able to separate us

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:07.630
from God's love that's in Christ Jesus our Lord.

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:10.630
Rejoice,

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:13.630
despite tribulation.

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:15.630
And now it's my pleasure to introduce

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:16.630
Brother Samuel Heard,

00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:18.630
remember the governing body

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:20.630
for the talk on the symposium,

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:24.630
we can rejoice despite distress.

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:34.609
Have you ever been distressed?

00:30:34.609 --> 00:30:36.609
Well, if you haven't,

00:30:36.609 --> 00:30:37.609
you're not human.

00:30:37.609 --> 00:30:39.609
Because all humans suffer

00:30:39.609 --> 00:30:41.609
from some form of distress

00:30:41.609 --> 00:30:42.609
in a short period of life

00:30:43.609 --> 00:30:47.609
that we have this side of the New World.

00:30:47.609 --> 00:30:49.609
But what is distress?

00:30:49.609 --> 00:30:52.609
Some say it's extreme anxiety.

00:30:52.609 --> 00:30:54.609
Others say, well, it's sorrow.

00:30:54.609 --> 00:30:58.609
Then there's a few who label it as pain.

00:30:58.609 --> 00:31:01.609
Well, what is it that causes the distress?

00:31:01.609 --> 00:31:03.609
Oh, a number of things.

00:31:03.609 --> 00:31:06.609
Here's one that somewhat heads the list,

00:31:06.609 --> 00:31:09.609
death of a spouse.

00:31:09.609 --> 00:31:11.609
Second behind that is injury

00:31:11.609 --> 00:31:14.609
or some type of illness.

00:31:14.609 --> 00:31:17.609
Then there's loss of a job.

00:31:17.609 --> 00:31:19.609
How am I going to care for my family,

00:31:19.609 --> 00:31:21.609
my wife and my children?

00:31:21.609 --> 00:31:24.609
And then here's a very important one,

00:31:24.609 --> 00:31:29.019
not being able to share

00:31:29.019 --> 00:31:32.019
in the kingdom preaching work to the full.

00:31:32.019 --> 00:31:34.019
So these are reasons

00:31:34.019 --> 00:31:36.019
that we are distressed.

00:31:36.019 --> 00:31:37.019
Now, of course,

00:31:37.019 --> 00:31:39.019
these are not the only reasons

00:31:39.019 --> 00:31:41.019
there's many others.

00:31:41.019 --> 00:31:45.019
But how would you fare?

00:31:45.019 --> 00:31:48.019
How would you feel

00:31:48.019 --> 00:31:51.019
if you're undergoing some type of distress?

00:31:51.019 --> 00:31:54.019
Well, could it be sad?

00:31:54.019 --> 00:31:56.019
Is that how you're going to feel?

00:31:56.019 --> 00:31:58.019
Are you depressed?

00:31:58.019 --> 00:31:59.019
Some say, well, yes.

00:31:59.019 --> 00:32:01.019
That's what hits me.

00:32:01.019 --> 00:32:03.019
Others say, well, low in spirits.

00:32:03.019 --> 00:32:06.019
I just, I don't know.

00:32:06.019 --> 00:32:08.019
I'm just down and out.

00:32:09.019 --> 00:32:13.359
My get up and go, got up and left.

00:32:13.359 --> 00:32:15.359
Others say, well, I just feel like going off

00:32:15.359 --> 00:32:18.359
and hiding and crying.

00:32:18.359 --> 00:32:20.359
Well, that pretty well sums it up,

00:32:20.359 --> 00:32:24.359
but is it possible

00:32:24.359 --> 00:32:28.359
to rejoice when distress?

00:32:28.359 --> 00:32:29.359
Well, we know it is

00:32:29.359 --> 00:32:32.359
because we have examples in the Bible.

00:32:32.359 --> 00:32:34.359
The Bible is filled with examples.

00:32:34.359 --> 00:32:37.359
We're just going to isolate one or two.

00:32:37.359 --> 00:32:41.359
Paul was one who rejoiced

00:32:41.359 --> 00:32:44.359
behind being distressed.

00:32:44.359 --> 00:32:45.359
He was able to rejoice

00:32:45.359 --> 00:32:48.359
despite the feelings that he had.

00:32:48.359 --> 00:32:50.359
Now, if you have your Bible handy,

00:32:50.359 --> 00:32:53.359
open it please to 2 Corinthians.

00:32:53.359 --> 00:32:55.359
And read along with me,

00:32:55.359 --> 00:33:00.359
2 Corinthians chapter 7 and verse 5.

00:33:00.359 --> 00:33:02.359
You'll notice that it says,

00:33:02.359 --> 00:33:04.359
in fact, when we arrived in Macedonia,

00:33:04.359 --> 00:33:06.359
our bodies got no relief.

00:33:06.359 --> 00:33:10.359
But we continued to be afflicted in every way.

00:33:10.359 --> 00:33:12.359
Now note the following.

00:33:12.359 --> 00:33:15.359
There were fights on the outside,

00:33:15.359 --> 00:33:17.359
fears within.

00:33:17.359 --> 00:33:20.359
Fights on the outside, fears within.

00:33:20.359 --> 00:33:22.359
Yes, Paul was up against it,

00:33:22.359 --> 00:33:24.359
and he knew it,

00:33:24.359 --> 00:33:27.359
but yet he was able to rejoice.

00:33:27.359 --> 00:33:29.359
But what was he up against?

00:33:29.359 --> 00:33:31.359
Well, earlier, Paul had hoped to meet up

00:33:31.359 --> 00:33:33.359
with Titus and Troas,

00:33:33.359 --> 00:33:35.359
but he hadn't heard from Titus,

00:33:35.359 --> 00:33:37.359
and he didn't get a message from him.

00:33:37.359 --> 00:33:39.359
He wondered about him.

00:33:39.359 --> 00:33:42.359
He wondered how he was feeling.

00:33:42.359 --> 00:33:46.359
It was something hard hitting

00:33:46.359 --> 00:33:48.359
against him at this time,

00:33:48.359 --> 00:33:51.359
in that Corinthian congregation.

00:33:51.359 --> 00:33:53.359
So Paul wanted to know.

00:33:53.359 --> 00:33:55.359
So he worried about his friend,

00:33:55.359 --> 00:33:57.359
and we would, too,

00:33:57.359 --> 00:33:59.359
if we were waiting to hear from a friend

00:33:59.359 --> 00:34:01.359
we hadn't received an answer.

00:34:01.359 --> 00:34:04.359
He likely worried it.

00:34:04.359 --> 00:34:08.360
So much that it caused him to feel

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:12.360
somewhat depressed.

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:16.360
He thought, well, how long will I have to wait

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:19.360
on my friend Titus?

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:21.360
Well, he didn't have to wait too long.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.360
Titus finally joined him in Macedonia,

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.360
and what happened?

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.360
Well, Paul was comforted,

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.360
and upon hearing Titus' favorable report

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:33.360
about the brothers and sisters in Corinth,

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:36.360
Paul rejoiced even more,

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.360
says 2 Corinthians chapter 7,

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.360
if you're just glassed down

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.360
at verses 6 and 7.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.360
So he was helped by his brother.

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.360
It's the brotherhood

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.360
that we have to reach out to, too,

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.360
and it will help us,

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.360
this beautiful brotherhood

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:58.360
that Jehovah has brought us into.

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.360
And we'll find that our brothers

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.360
are there for us,

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:05.360
regardless of what we may be fighting against.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.360
So we can rejoice.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.360
We may experience distress

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.360
in the form of discouragement,

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.360
and usually all of us

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:16.360
have had that come into our life

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:18.360
from time to time.

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.360
There are so many things

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.360
that can bring about discouragement.

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:22.360
Here's something else.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.360
The anguish over a lost loved one.

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.360
Maybe a marriage made has died.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.360
You've been together for many years,

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.360
and like Jehovah said,

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.360
in the Garden of Eden,

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.360
the two shall become one.

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.360
And you know that's really

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.360
what happened to you and your wife

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.360
that you lost or your husband,

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.360
not that you lost.

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:45.360
So you are somewhat low in spirits.

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.360
You are blue.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.360
You're a little downhearted,

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:52.360
gloomy, heavyhearted,

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:55.360
and, yes, sad.

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.360
But now let's recall

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:00.360
that we have three provisions

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:03.360
that can strengthen our ability to rejoice

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:05.360
despite the trials

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:07.360
that we're undergoing.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.360
What are they?

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:09.360
Well, here's the first one.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:13.360
It's our relationship with Jehovah.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:16.360
David had a fine relationship with Jehovah,

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.360
and if you'll turn to 1 Samuel,

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.360
chapter 30,

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:21.360
and just follow along,

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:23.360
as you hear me say a few things

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.360
behind these two, three verses or four,

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.360
we're going to start with verse 1.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.360
That's the first Samuel chapter 30.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:35.360
When his own men wanted to kill David

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.360
because the amelikites

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:39.360
burned the city down

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.360
and had taken their wives

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.360
and children captive

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.360
even took two of David's wives.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.360
Well, David was very distressed,

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.360
as you'll see, in that account.

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.360
But now notice near the end of it,

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.360
there in verse 6,

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:56.360
but David strengthened himself

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:59.360
by Jehovah his God.

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.360
Here's where our strength comes to,

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:04.360
is from turning to Jehovah our God,

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:06.360
and he's there for us,

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:08.360
and he's going to comfort us.

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:10.360
He is the God of comfort,

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.360
as was acknowledged

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:14.360
in his written word of the Bible.

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:15.360
So that's the first.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.360
Our relationship with Jehovah.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:19.360
Now, here comes the second.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:22.360
It's our brotherhood.

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:26.360
My how we are strengthened by our brothers.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:29.360
Remember the 133rd Psalm

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:32.360
where it says at the very beginning,

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:35.360
look how good and how pleasant it is

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:38.360
for our brothers to dwell together in unity.

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:42.360
Now, we all know that that is a true statement.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:45.360
But we also know something else.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:48.360
It's a major scheme of Satan the Devil

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:51.360
to isolate us from our brothers

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:55.360
if he can put us in jail.

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:58.360
But if that happens and we are jailed,

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:00.360
we can still associate.

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:02.360
Now, how can we do that if we're jailed

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:04.360
and there's way off somewhere

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.360
and we're behind bars?

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:09.360
Here it is by memories.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:13.360
For instance, get out your scrapbook and photo album.

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:16.360
That are locked in your brain,

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:19.360
not the literal that locked in your brain,

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:23.360
and feed on the spiritual scraps.

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.360
What are they?

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:25.360
The memories.

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:29.360
Memories are foods that strengthen and cause rejoicing.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:34.360
Now, if any of you out there are as old as I am,

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:38.360
then you know that old folks do this all the time.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:41.360
We're just too tired to do anything else.

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:44.360
So we just live on memories

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.360
and it brings joy to our heart.

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:48.360
Now, that's the second thing.

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:51.360
Now, the third is our hope.

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:54.360
Our hope is to serve Jehovah under righteous conditions

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:56.360
throughout eternity.

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:59.360
Eternity is forever.

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.360
It never ends.

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:05.360
It goes on and on and on.

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:08.360
For instance, look at the sky above.

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:12.360
You cannot see a beginning or ending.

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:14.360
That's eternity.

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.360
Always there.

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:18.360
You're going to be able to rejoice for an eternity,

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.360
living forever.

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.360
Now, as you watch the following video,

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:26.360
take note of which provisions helped our brother and sister

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:30.360
to rejoice and that despite distress.

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:42.340
We knew when we first got married

00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:45.340
that we would enjoy having a family.

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:47.340
So when we first found out that we were pregnant,

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:49.340
we were overjoyed.

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:52.340
When Becky first told me she was pregnant,

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:56.340
it's like a light switch went off in my heart.

00:39:56.340 --> 00:40:00.340
Immediately, I felt like a dad.

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:04.340
Instantly, you began to make plans.

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:10.909
It was like all this love just flooded in.

00:40:10.909 --> 00:40:12.909
One day, Becky was feeling a little off

00:40:12.909 --> 00:40:14.909
and a friend encouraged us to just go see the doctor.

00:40:14.909 --> 00:40:16.909
So we did.

00:40:16.909 --> 00:40:19.909
And while we were there, they did an ultrasound.

00:40:19.909 --> 00:40:22.909
The doctor came back and they said

00:40:22.909 --> 00:40:28.380
there wasn't a heartbeat anymore.

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:33.380
That was a very difficult moment.

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:37.380
Something I can never forget.

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:40.380
Because all of a sudden, all of you,

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:44.380
those hopes, those dreams, those preparations you are making,

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:51.500
they're gone.

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:53.500
This place in your heart that opened up

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:57.940
to make room for this child

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:00.940
is now this huge gaping open hole

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:07.039
and there's nothing to fill it.

00:41:07.039 --> 00:41:11.039
It just is an incredible emptiness.

00:41:11.039 --> 00:41:14.039
We didn't know what to do.

00:41:14.039 --> 00:41:16.039
But it was a meeting night.

00:41:16.039 --> 00:41:20.039
So we wanted to go to the meeting.

00:41:20.039 --> 00:41:23.039
It felt like the place where Jehovah's Holy Spirit is.

00:41:23.039 --> 00:41:26.039
And we wanted to be there because we knew

00:41:26.039 --> 00:41:30.039
we were not going to be able to survive this on our own strength.

00:41:30.039 --> 00:41:33.860
We needed Jehovah.

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:36.860
After people learned that we had lost

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:40.860
the baby so many people shared a little bit of their experiences with me,

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:45.860
which made us feel not alone for sure.

00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:48.860
But Jehovah has also given us some incredible friends,

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:52.860
friends that have stuck closer to us than a brother,

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:55.860
friends that always seem to know when we're having a hard day,

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:59.860
who have prayed with us, who have taken walks with us,

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:05.860
listened, and I know those are expressions Jehovah has given us.

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:10.860
Regaining joy isn't working progress.

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:14.860
There was a particular scripture in personal study

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:16.860
that I found very helpful.

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:20.860
Psalm 39, where it talks about how there's no where.

00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:23.860
That Jehovah can't find us.

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:26.860
There's no darkness that is too dark from Jehovah.

00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:29.860
And it felt like such a dark place.

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:33.860
Dwelling on that scripture was something that helped me a lot

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:35.860
and gradually bit by bit.

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:45.900
I felt like Jehovah did help me to see beautiful things again.

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:49.900
When we experience distress, Jehovah helps us.

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:53.900
We're not left in despair.

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:56.900
For instance, here in 2 Corinthians chapter 4,

00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:00.900
it tells us if we also include the footnote.

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:04.900
Now, that's the eighth verse of 2 Corinthians chapter 4.

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:06.900
Now, this is how it reads.

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:10.900
We're hard pressed in every way, but not cramped beyond movement.

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:15.900
We're perplexed, but not absolutely with no way out.

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:21.900
Now, the footnote says, not left in despair.

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:25.900
Jehovah is not going to leave us in despair.

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:28.900
Now, which provisions from Jehovah are helping you

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:32.900
to rejoice despite any mental or emotional distress

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:36.900
that you may be experiencing even now?

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:39.900
Is it your relationship with Jehovah?

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:40.900
The Brotherhood?

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:42.900
Our hope?

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:45.900
Or is it something else?

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:53.210
In addition to the provisions from Jehovah, consider these practical suggestions.

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:58.210
Maintain a healthy diet.

00:43:58.210 --> 00:44:02.210
Couple with that, get sufficient rest

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:06.210
and get a measure of exercise.

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:09.210
Now, you can make two lists.

00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:12.210
One of the problems that you can solve

00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:18.210
and the other problems you cannot solve at present.

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:23.210
Act on the first list and leave the rest in Jehovah's hands.

00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:28.969
Talk things out with an elder,

00:44:28.969 --> 00:44:32.969
or perhaps a mature friend, someone you're close to,

00:44:32.969 --> 00:44:35.969
and a parent.

00:44:35.969 --> 00:44:41.969
These are there to help us, and they're ready and willing

00:44:41.969 --> 00:44:45.969
to share the knowledge and understanding that they have

00:44:45.969 --> 00:44:49.969
and they'll do it generously with you.

00:44:49.969 --> 00:44:52.969
Realize that some forms of mental distress

00:44:52.969 --> 00:44:55.969
may require professional assistance.

00:44:55.969 --> 00:44:59.969
This is what Jesus said at Luke chapter 5 verse 31.

00:44:59.969 --> 00:45:03.969
Those who are healthy do not need a physician,

00:45:03.969 --> 00:45:06.969
but those who are ill do.

00:45:06.969 --> 00:45:09.969
Now, of course, that decision is up to you,

00:45:09.969 --> 00:45:11.969
but it's there in the Scripture.

00:45:11.969 --> 00:45:13.969
It may be that you need

00:45:13.969 --> 00:45:16.969
the help of a physician, someone who's qualified

00:45:16.969 --> 00:45:20.969
to look into certain matters.

00:45:20.969 --> 00:45:24.969
Please rejoice in knowing that you have Jehovah's approval.

00:45:24.969 --> 00:45:28.969
Don't doubt it, not even for a moment.

00:45:28.969 --> 00:45:33.969
Now granted, it's not easy to deal with mental

00:45:33.969 --> 00:45:36.969
or emotional distress.

00:45:36.969 --> 00:45:41.969
But keep in mind that Jehovah understands

00:45:41.969 --> 00:45:46.969
and he will help you to keep on enduring.

00:45:46.969 --> 00:45:50.969
And your loyal endurance brings your Jehovah's approval,

00:45:50.969 --> 00:45:55.969
which is one of the greatest reasons that we have for rejoicing.

00:45:55.969 --> 00:45:59.969
Know that God has not left you.

00:45:59.969 --> 00:46:06.969
You have His approval like a large shield surrounding you

00:46:06.969 --> 00:46:08.969
and His blessing.

00:46:08.969 --> 00:46:12.969
And rejoice in that knowledge and keep on rejoicing

00:46:12.969 --> 00:46:18.300
despite distress.

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:21.300
Brother Garrett Loesch, a member of the governing body

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:25.300
will now present the next talk of this symposium.

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:36.699
We can rejoice despite persecution.

00:46:36.699 --> 00:46:38.699
Since the beginning of Christianity,

00:46:38.699 --> 00:46:41.699
Christians have been persecuted.

00:46:41.699 --> 00:46:46.699
Please locate with me 2 Corinthians chapter 11.

00:46:46.699 --> 00:46:51.699
Paul experienced the persecution and referred to it

00:46:51.699 --> 00:46:58.699
in 2 Corinthians chapter 11 verses 23 to 25.

00:46:58.699 --> 00:47:02.699
And it says, are they ministers of Christ?

00:47:02.699 --> 00:47:06.699
I reply like a madman, I am more outstandingly one.

00:47:06.699 --> 00:47:10.699
I've done more work, been imprisoned more often,

00:47:10.699 --> 00:47:15.699
suffered countless beatings and experienced many near deaths.

00:47:15.699 --> 00:47:20.699
Five times I received 40 strokes, less one from the Jews.

00:47:20.699 --> 00:47:23.699
Three times I was beaten with rods.

00:47:23.699 --> 00:47:26.699
Once I was stoned, three times I experienced shipwreck.

00:47:26.699 --> 00:47:32.460
A night in the day I've spent in the open sea.

00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:36.460
Shortly after recounting His many difficulties,

00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:41.460
in chapter 12 verse 10, Paul wrote,

00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:46.460
so I take pleasure in weaknesses, in insults,

00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:49.460
in times of need, in persecutions,

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:51.460
and difficult is for Christ.

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:54.460
For when I'm weak, I am powerful.

00:47:54.460 --> 00:48:00.780
Of course, Paul took no pleasure in persecution itself.

00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:04.780
But he rejoiced because of what can result from it,

00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:08.780
contributing to Jehovah's vindication.

00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:16.780
Find the Philippians chapter 114 and then verse 18.

00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:22.780
Persecution gives us also an opportunity to see Jehovah act

00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:26.780
in behalf of His people and magnify His name.

00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:29.780
It can lead to a fine witness.

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:35.780
In Philippians 1 verse 14 and 18, Paul wrote,

00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:42.559
Now most of the brothers in the Lord have gained confidence

00:48:42.559 --> 00:48:44.559
because of my prison bonds,

00:48:44.559 --> 00:48:47.559
and they are showing all the more courage

00:48:47.559 --> 00:48:52.559
to speak the word of God fearlessly.

00:48:52.559 --> 00:48:55.559
And verse 18, with what result?

00:48:55.559 --> 00:48:59.559
Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth,

00:48:59.559 --> 00:49:03.559
Christ is being proclaimed and I rejoice over this.

00:49:03.559 --> 00:49:09.000
In fact, I will also keep on rejoicing.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.000
Instead of weakening our relationship with Jehovah and our hope,

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:18.000
persecution can strengthen it.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:23.000
In the discussion recorded at Romans chapter 5, 3 and 4,

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000
Paul explains,

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.000
Let us exalt while in tribulations.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Endurance leads to an approved condition,

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.000
the approved condition in turn to hope,

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.000
and hope does not lead to disappointment.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:47.000
There is no doubt that hope helps us mightily to endure persecution.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.000
The Bible uses the word hope in different contexts.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.000
It speaks of the hope of salvation,

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.000
which can refer to spiritual salvation.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.000
There is hope of surviving Armageddon.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:07.000
There is hope of everlasting life on the Paradise Earth.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:11.000
There is hope of immortality in heaven.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:17.000
What hope was he talking about in Romans chapter 5, 3 and 4,

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000
about the heavenly hope?

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000
Look at the context.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.000
Romans 5, 2, and the second part of the verse says,

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:34.000
Let us rejoice based on the hope of the glory of God.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.000
All Christians in the first century had the heavenly hope.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:43.000
Their hope was not just that problems or well conditions would be resolved

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.000
or that they would get healed from some sickness.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000
Their hope was the heavenly hope.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.000
Colossians 1, 3 says,

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.000
We always thank God when we pray for you,

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:03.000
because of the hope that is being reserved for you in the heavens.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Now, please turn to Romans chapter 8, verse 20 and 21.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:17.000
The great crowd of Jehovah's witnesses today hope that Jehovah will reward them

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.000
in an earthly paradise.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:30.000
Paul pointed to that hope when he wrote in Romans chapter 8, verse 20 and 21.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:35.000
For the creation was subjected to futility, not by its own will,

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:40.000
but through the one who subjected it on the basis of hope,

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:48.000
that the creation itself will be also set free from enslavement to corruption

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:52.000
and have the glorious freedom of the children of God.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:59.440
However, when Paul said in Romans chapter 12, verse 12,

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:01.440
rejoice in the hope ahead.

00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:04.440
He meant the heavenly hope.

00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:10.440
But the other sheep also can rejoice in the hope that is ahead of them.

00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:14.440
So then we can all rejoice triumphantly.

00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:17.440
The world's hope is dark.

00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:19.440
Your hope is bright.

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:21.440
The world's hope is collapsing.

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:24.440
Your hope nears fulfillment.

00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:27.440
The world's hope is based on credulity.

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:30.440
Your hope is based on faith.

00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:33.440
The world's hope leads to disappointment.

00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:36.440
Your hope leads to success.

00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:39.440
For with the new world, so very near,

00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:42.440
our fondest hopes whether heavenly or earthly

00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:47.440
will soon be realized to our eternal satisfaction.

00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:53.440
Let's read together Titus chapter 2, verse 13,

00:52:53.440 --> 00:53:03.800
while we wait for the happy hope

00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:07.800
and glorious manifestation of the great God

00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:10.800
and of our Savior Jesus Christ.

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:17.079
Furthermore, according to Romans 8, 24 and 25,

00:53:17.079 --> 00:53:21.079
hope will help us to endure.

00:53:21.079 --> 00:53:25.079
Hope that is seen is not hope.

00:53:25.079 --> 00:53:28.079
But if we hope for what we do not see,

00:53:28.079 --> 00:53:33.079
we keep on waiting for it with endurance, the Scripture says.

00:53:33.079 --> 00:53:36.079
There are degrees of hope.

00:53:36.079 --> 00:53:41.079
How can we strengthen or deepen our hope?

00:53:41.079 --> 00:53:44.079
As to the term hope in the Bible,

00:53:44.079 --> 00:53:46.079
the basic sense of the Greek term,

00:53:46.079 --> 00:53:52.079
alpes, used here, means expectation of good.

00:53:52.079 --> 00:53:57.079
In this context, Paul mentions hope last in the series,

00:53:57.079 --> 00:54:02.079
after tribulation, endurance, and approved condition.

00:54:02.079 --> 00:54:06.079
So he is obviously not referring to the initial hope

00:54:06.079 --> 00:54:09.079
gained by accepting the good news from God.

00:54:09.079 --> 00:54:13.079
Rather, he is referring to a reinforced hope

00:54:13.079 --> 00:54:17.079
that a Christian can gain after enduring.

00:54:17.079 --> 00:54:20.079
When a Christian faithfully endures trials,

00:54:20.079 --> 00:54:24.079
he realizes that he has God's approval.

00:54:24.079 --> 00:54:30.460
This realization strengthens his initial hope.

00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:36.460
Like Paul, we can rejoice despite persecution.

00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:41.460
We may encounter hateful words and actions at school,

00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:43.460
at work in our family,

00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:47.460
or as a result of governmental restrictions.

00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:52.460
In Matthew chapter 5, 11 and 12,

00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:56.460
in the sermon on the Mount,

00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:59.460
Jesus said the following.

00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:06.119
Happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you,

00:55:06.119 --> 00:55:11.119
and lyingly say every sort of wicked things against you for my sake.

00:55:11.119 --> 00:55:17.119
Rejoice and be overjoyed since your reward is great in the heavens,

00:55:17.119 --> 00:55:21.119
for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to you.

00:55:21.119 --> 00:55:28.010
As you watch the following video, note which provisions

00:55:28.010 --> 00:55:43.139
helped our brother and sister to rejoice despite persecution.

00:55:43.139 --> 00:55:53.289
Early one morning, armed Russian special forces broke into my home.

00:55:53.289 --> 00:55:58.289
They handcuffed me and searched my place.

00:55:58.289 --> 00:56:01.289
They took me to the FSB office for interrogation.

00:56:01.289 --> 00:56:09.260
Two days later, the court sentenced me to pre-trial detention.

00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:13.260
I was scared because I didn't know how I would be treated in prison.

00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:16.260
Threatening that things would get worse for me,

00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:20.260
the officer demanded that I incriminate myself, admit guilt,

00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:23.260
and give the names of my fellow believers.

00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:26.260
I also really missed my dear wife.

00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:28.260
It was so hard without her.

00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:33.260
For two months, I didn't have any spiritual food or a Bible.

00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:36.260
So I decided to make one.

00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:40.260
My wife sent me a notebook, and every day I wrote down verses

00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:42.260
that I was able to remember.

00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:47.260
After I had written about 500 verses, I was given a Bible.

00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:52.260
Because I was so spiritually hungry, I read it through in four months.

00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:55.260
During this time, I wrote letters to my wife and friends

00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:59.260
and shared interesting things that I learned from my reading.

00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:03.260
But the letters I received from my friends and my dear wife

00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:07.260
gave me the feeling that the brothers and sisters were so close to me,

00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:10.260
as if they were in the cells next to me.

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:16.739
I wasn't lonely. I felt as if my friends were right there with me.

00:57:16.739 --> 00:57:20.739
Pre-trial detention isolates a person from society,

00:57:20.739 --> 00:57:24.739
but it's impossible to isolate someone from Jehovah.

00:57:24.739 --> 00:57:27.739
Throughout the day, I prayed to Jehovah many times,

00:57:27.739 --> 00:57:29.739
but I especially waited for bad time.

00:57:29.739 --> 00:57:33.739
When everyone wasn't bad and only the nightlight was on,

00:57:33.739 --> 00:57:36.739
I could talk to Jehovah as much as I wanted.

00:57:36.739 --> 00:57:40.739
There were times when I was all alone in the cell.

00:57:40.739 --> 00:57:43.739
And of course, I took advantage of the situation.

00:57:43.739 --> 00:57:50.739
I would get down on my knees and would literally cry as I prayed to Jehovah.

00:57:50.739 --> 00:57:54.739
I decided to write my requests to God on a sheet of paper

00:57:54.739 --> 00:57:57.739
and then mark off the ones that he answered.

00:57:57.739 --> 00:58:01.739
I was convinced that Jehovah was very close to me.

00:58:01.739 --> 00:58:05.739
I also quietly sang our songs throughout the day.

00:58:05.739 --> 00:58:09.739
But when I was all alone, I sang at the top of my voice.

00:58:10.739 --> 00:58:13.739
I also tried to give a witness whenever possible.

00:58:13.739 --> 00:58:15.739
We discussed a variety of topics,

00:58:15.739 --> 00:58:19.739
everything from tattoos to the King of the North.

00:58:19.739 --> 00:58:23.739
All my fears and anxieties were for nothing.

00:58:23.739 --> 00:58:26.739
I was in detention 343 days,

00:58:26.739 --> 00:58:30.739
and not even a hair fell from my head.

00:58:30.739 --> 00:58:33.739
This was the most interesting year of my life,

00:58:33.739 --> 00:58:37.739
an excellent school to help refine my spiritual qualities.

00:58:37.739 --> 00:58:40.739
I have never felt so close to Jehovah.

00:58:40.739 --> 00:58:44.739
What a great honor to uphold God's sovereignty in this way.

00:58:44.739 --> 00:58:53.980
What is helping you today to rejoice

00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:57.980
despite any opposition you may be experiencing now?

00:58:57.980 --> 00:59:00.980
It is your relationship with Jehovah,

00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:04.980
the brotherhood, your heavenly or earthly hope,

00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:06.980
all these things.

00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:14.800
Maybe rejoice in the love of Jehovah and our brothers.

00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:17.800
If you are enduring persecution,

00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:19.800
be assured that your brothers,

00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:21.800
not only your friends,

00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:23.800
not only brothers in your congregation,

00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:27.800
but all around the earth are praying in your behalf.

00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:32.800
Angels observe you and feel proud if you stay faithful.

00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:36.800
You can greatly contribute to the encouragement

00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:39.800
of the faithful angels.

00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:43.800
Like Jehovah, Jesus, and the angels,

00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:46.800
your brothers can take pride in you

00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:49.800
and rejoice because of your endurance

00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:55.719
and faith despite persecution.

00:59:55.719 --> 00:59:57.719
Brother William Turner and Helper

00:59:57.719 --> 01:00:00.719
to the Service Committee will now present

01:00:00.719 --> 01:00:02.719
the next talk of this symposium

01:00:02.719 --> 01:00:05.719
we can rejoice despite hunger.

01:00:05.719 --> 01:00:15.150
How do you feel when you miss a meal

01:00:15.150 --> 01:00:18.150
or haven't eaten for some time?

01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:21.150
You know, for many, it affects their mood,

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:24.150
their ability to concentrate,

01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:28.150
sometimes their ability to even think straight.

01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:32.150
But what if that hunger was beyond our control?

01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:35.150
Or prolonged to the point where we had no other choice

01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:37.150
but to be hungry?

01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:41.150
Well, that was the situation the Apostle Paul found himself in

01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:44.150
as he engaged in his ministry.

01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:47.150
For example, a second Corinthians 1127,

01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:50.150
Paul said that he was in hunger and thirst

01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:53.150
and frequently without food.

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:55.150
This likely occurred while Paul was traveling

01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:59.150
through desolate regions or hot desert areas.

01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:01.150
At times, he may have been hungry and thirsty

01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:04.150
because of being dependent on strangers

01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:06.150
or on whatever provisions he could obtain

01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:10.150
through his own labors in unfamiliar surroundings.

01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:14.150
Paul also lived during the time of a great famine,

01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:16.150
a famine which lasted more than three years

01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:19.150
and caused oppressive poverty in Judea

01:01:19.150 --> 01:01:22.150
and Jerusalem.

01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:26.150
But despite facing all these times without food,

01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:31.150
it's interesting to note the attitude of the Apostle Paul.

01:01:31.150 --> 01:01:33.150
A second Corinthians chapter 6 verse 10,

01:01:33.150 --> 01:01:36.150
he describes himself in his fellow Christians

01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:43.150
as sorrowing but ever rejoicing.

01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:45.150
So Paul acknowledged that difficult times

01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:49.150
could bring a measure of sorrow and distress.

01:01:49.150 --> 01:01:53.150
But how was he able to rejoice?

01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:59.150
To have this inner joy despite his hunger?

01:01:59.150 --> 01:02:00.150
Well, notice his answer.

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:04.150
Turn with me in your Bible's please to the book of Philippians.

01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:11.150
And we're going to read Philippians chapter 4 verses 11 through 13.

01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:18.389
Paul says, not that I am saying this because I am in need,

01:02:18.389 --> 01:02:20.389
but I have learned to be self-sufficient

01:02:20.389 --> 01:02:22.389
regardless of my circumstances.

01:02:22.389 --> 01:02:25.389
I know how to be low on provisions

01:02:25.389 --> 01:02:27.389
and how to have an abundance.

01:02:27.389 --> 01:02:31.389
In everything and in all circumstances,

01:02:31.389 --> 01:02:34.389
I have learned the secret of both how to be full

01:02:34.389 --> 01:02:37.389
and how to hunger, both how to have an abundance

01:02:37.389 --> 01:02:40.389
and how to do without.

01:02:40.389 --> 01:02:45.389
For all things I have the strength through the one who gives me power.

01:02:45.389 --> 01:02:49.829
Did you note in verse 12,

01:02:49.829 --> 01:02:54.829
Paul speaks of learning the secret of both how to be full

01:02:54.829 --> 01:02:56.829
and how to hunger.

01:02:56.829 --> 01:03:02.829
This secret involves relying on Jehovah for life's necessities

01:03:02.829 --> 01:03:06.829
and being satisfied with whatever he provides.

01:03:06.829 --> 01:03:08.829
And Paul certainly did that.

01:03:08.829 --> 01:03:10.829
He learned to trade to support himself,

01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:13.829
so as not to be a burden to others.

01:03:13.829 --> 01:03:15.829
He was fully occupied with his ministry,

01:03:15.829 --> 01:03:18.829
so he had few material possessions,

01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:21.829
but he was grateful for the brotherhood.

01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:25.829
He was appreciative of what those brothers were able to provide,

01:03:25.829 --> 01:03:27.829
what he needed.

01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:30.829
Paul learned through each of these experiences.

01:03:30.829 --> 01:03:34.829
And as he saw Jehovah's hand in his life,

01:03:34.829 --> 01:03:37.829
it became apparent to him that no matter what his circumstances were,

01:03:38.829 --> 01:03:43.829
he had to look to Jehovah to satisfy his needs.

01:03:43.829 --> 01:03:45.829
Did you notice verse 13,

01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:48.829
Jehovah sustained Paul.

01:03:48.829 --> 01:03:50.829
He gave him power.

01:03:50.829 --> 01:03:54.829
So when Paul did face those adverse circumstances,

01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:57.829
he was still able to be content,

01:03:57.829 --> 01:03:59.829
maintain inner joy,

01:03:59.829 --> 01:04:04.369
and carry out his ministry.

01:04:04.369 --> 01:04:08.369
Well, what can you and I learn from Paul's example?

01:04:08.369 --> 01:04:13.369
It may be that we too might face hunger for a variety of reasons.

01:04:13.369 --> 01:04:16.369
For example, food shortages.

01:04:16.369 --> 01:04:21.369
This could result from civil unrest or an economic crisis.

01:04:21.369 --> 01:04:25.369
World events today have caused many to lose their jobs around the world,

01:04:25.369 --> 01:04:27.369
including our brothers.

01:04:27.369 --> 01:04:34.369
So a personal economic setback may force us to live on less.

01:04:34.369 --> 01:04:37.369
Hunger can also result from persecution.

01:04:38.369 --> 01:04:41.369
When many of our brothers were put in Nazi concentration camps,

01:04:41.369 --> 01:04:46.369
depriving them of adequate food was one of the diabolical methods used

01:04:46.369 --> 01:04:50.369
in an effort to break their integrity.

01:04:50.369 --> 01:04:53.369
And even when it comes to theocratic pursuits,

01:04:53.369 --> 01:04:55.369
some who move to serve with the need is greater,

01:04:55.369 --> 01:04:58.369
are forced to make adjustments,

01:04:58.369 --> 01:05:02.369
and must learn to be content with less.

01:05:02.369 --> 01:05:05.369
So really, in any number of situations,

01:05:05.369 --> 01:05:11.369
you and I could experience a lack of food or even hunger.

01:05:11.369 --> 01:05:17.369
And that could make us feel anxious and distressed.

01:05:17.369 --> 01:05:24.369
But the antidote is trust and reliance on Jehovah.

01:05:24.369 --> 01:05:28.369
You know, when we do that, it helps us to remain calm

01:05:28.369 --> 01:05:33.369
and to take things one day at a time.

01:05:33.369 --> 01:05:37.369
When inflation hit in his country, one father said,

01:05:37.369 --> 01:05:42.369
my dearly prayer was simply that God would give us today our bread

01:05:42.369 --> 01:05:49.320
for this day in order for us to survive.

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:54.320
We must also be grateful with whatever Jehovah provides.

01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:57.320
When that same father went to the food line to purchase items,

01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:00.320
he said, one time, the only thing they had left was

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:03.320
something he didn't like.

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:05.320
Oh, what did he do?

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:11.320
He said, I didn't like it, but it was food.

01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:14.320
So that's what we ate that night.

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:19.320
And he was grateful to Jehovah for providing it.

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:22.320
You know, perhaps right now, we may be in a position

01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:25.320
where we only eat what we like.

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:30.320
But if circumstances change, could we adjust

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:33.320
and still be grateful?

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:37.320
Isn't it reassuring that we are cared for by a God

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:41.320
who gives us what we need?

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:44.320
And of course, it is important that we utilize

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:47.320
the resources Jehovah provides.

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:50.320
We'd like you to watch the following video.

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:53.320
As you do, note which provisions helped our sister

01:06:53.320 --> 01:07:14.219
to rejoice despite experiencing hunger.

01:07:14.219 --> 01:07:18.219
Well, here in Venezuela, long before the crisis,

01:07:18.219 --> 01:07:24.579
there weren't so many financial problems like we have today.

01:07:24.579 --> 01:07:28.579
We could go to the stores, we could buy the amount of food we wanted,

01:07:28.579 --> 01:07:37.110
and life was peaceful.

01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:43.900
For us, the situation started to get really bad five years ago.

01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:47.900
It was hard to get any food at all, even basic items.

01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:53.949
When it came time to buy something, well, it was all gone.

01:07:53.949 --> 01:07:57.949
There were two elders that I can say were checking on me almost daily,

01:07:57.949 --> 01:08:02.650
always asking how much food I needed.

01:08:02.650 --> 01:08:04.650
When I prepared it and served it,

01:08:04.650 --> 01:08:07.650
my main concern was that my children would get enough.

01:08:07.650 --> 01:08:13.619
I always gave them more food.

01:08:13.619 --> 01:08:18.470
Even though my youngest boy would ask,

01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:21.470
Mommy, is that what you're going to eat?

01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:25.470
I would tell him, yes, dear, I'm fine with this.

01:08:25.470 --> 01:08:28.470
Then he would say, I don't think so.

01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:35.340
I would think, I can handle this.

01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:38.340
But the amount that I was eating just wasn't enough for my body.

01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:48.939
One Sunday morning during the meeting, I wasn't feeling very well.

01:08:48.939 --> 01:08:51.939
But thanks to Jehovah, my daughter was nearby.

01:08:51.939 --> 01:08:56.939
When I came to, she said, Mom, you fainted three times.

01:08:56.939 --> 01:08:59.939
I said, that can't be.

01:08:59.939 --> 01:09:02.939
So the brothers immediately took me to the doctor.

01:09:02.939 --> 01:09:06.939
I was diagnosed as having severe malnutrition.

01:09:06.939 --> 01:09:12.659
The brothers began a plan of action.

01:09:12.659 --> 01:09:14.659
They brought food that was already prepared,

01:09:14.659 --> 01:09:20.029
and in fact, they would sit by me until I finished my food.

01:09:20.029 --> 01:09:23.029
I have not yet fully recovered my body weight,

01:09:23.029 --> 01:09:25.029
because I was a little heavier.

01:09:25.029 --> 01:09:28.029
But health wise, I have felt very well.

01:09:28.029 --> 01:09:34.039
The elders were always looking after me.

01:09:34.039 --> 01:09:38.039
That boosted my energy, and definitely, I never lost my joy.

01:09:38.039 --> 01:09:44.529
And it's all thanks to Jehovah.

01:09:44.529 --> 01:09:47.529
Thanks to him, because he is the one who sustains me.

01:09:47.529 --> 01:09:50.529
He cloaks me, he feeds me, and he gives me great friends.

01:09:50.529 --> 01:09:59.479
That is what Jehovah gives me.

01:09:59.479 --> 01:10:02.479
Did you notice the provisions that helped our sister?

01:10:02.479 --> 01:10:05.479
First, her relationship with Jehovah.

01:10:05.479 --> 01:10:08.479
She saw the importance of staying close to him

01:10:08.479 --> 01:10:11.479
and regularly attending her meetings.

01:10:11.479 --> 01:10:15.479
And then, of course, the Brotherhood.

01:10:15.479 --> 01:10:19.479
Wasn't it comforting to see how attentive the elders were?

01:10:19.479 --> 01:10:22.479
Making daily checks on her, providing food for her and her family,

01:10:22.479 --> 01:10:26.479
and even making sure she ate enough as well?

01:10:26.479 --> 01:10:29.479
Well, it's these same provisions,

01:10:29.479 --> 01:10:31.479
maintaining our relationship with Jehovah,

01:10:31.479 --> 01:10:34.479
receiving relief from the Brotherhood,

01:10:34.479 --> 01:10:38.479
as well as holding fast to our hope that can help us to rejoice,

01:10:38.479 --> 01:10:42.479
despite any periods of hunger.

01:10:42.479 --> 01:10:43.479
We agree.

01:10:43.479 --> 01:10:47.479
We are fully convinced of what Paul said in Philippians 412.

01:10:47.479 --> 01:10:55.479
Jehovah can and does provide life's necessities in all circumstances.

01:10:55.479 --> 01:11:01.920
When facing hunger, it is natural to be concerned for our own welfare

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:03.920
and that of our loved ones.

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:08.920
And yet, as we've seen, it is possible to rejoice.

01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:11.920
Despite any hunger, we may experience.

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:16.920
But the key, learn the secret.

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:18.920
Everyone likes to be in on a secret.

01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:23.920
And Jehovah is more than happy to reveal this one to us.

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:30.920
But we must rely on him and see how he acts in our behalf.

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:35.920
How pleased Jehovah must be when his servants remain loyal and joyful,

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:39.920
trusting that he will never abandon them.

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:45.390
For the Robert Lucioni, a helper to the publishing committee,

01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:49.390
will now present the next talk of this symposium.

01:11:49.390 --> 01:12:00.079
We can rejoice, despite nakedness.

01:12:00.079 --> 01:12:05.079
Is it possible to rejoice despite experiencing difficult trials?

01:12:05.079 --> 01:12:09.079
Thus far, we've seen how the Apostle Paul maintained his joy

01:12:09.079 --> 01:12:14.079
despite tribulation, distress, persecution, or even hunger.

01:12:14.079 --> 01:12:17.079
And note out, this has been encouragement to you

01:12:17.079 --> 01:12:22.079
because many of you have or are going through those very things.

01:12:22.079 --> 01:12:26.079
But what about situations where we lose everything,

01:12:26.079 --> 01:12:29.079
due to disasters or civil unrest?

01:12:29.079 --> 01:12:33.079
Can Paul's experience help us in that?

01:12:33.079 --> 01:12:36.079
Our theme scripture in Romans chapter 8, verse 35,

01:12:36.079 --> 01:12:41.079
quotes Paul stating that not even nakedness can separate us

01:12:41.079 --> 01:12:43.079
from the love of the Christ.

01:12:43.079 --> 01:12:46.079
And Paul had first-hand experience with that as well.

01:12:46.079 --> 01:12:51.079
It turned pleased to 2 Corinthians chapter 11 and verse 27

01:12:51.079 --> 01:12:54.079
and notice how he describes his trials.

01:12:54.079 --> 01:12:57.079
2 Corinthians 11, 27.

01:12:57.079 --> 01:13:03.079
In labor and toil, in sleepless nights often, in hunger and thirst,

01:13:03.079 --> 01:13:08.079
frequently without food, in cold and lacking clothing,

01:13:08.079 --> 01:13:11.079
or nakedness, as the footnote says.

01:13:11.079 --> 01:13:15.079
Now Paul's lack of clothing was not due to laziness on his part.

01:13:15.079 --> 01:13:20.079
We know from the scriptures that Paul worked hard to care for his needs.

01:13:20.079 --> 01:13:27.079
But rather, being cold and lacking clothing was due to things he experienced in his ministry.

01:13:27.079 --> 01:13:31.079
For example, remember the occasion when Paul was on board the ship

01:13:31.079 --> 01:13:36.079
that was driven and shipwrecked by that most violent wind on the Mediterranean

01:13:36.079 --> 01:13:42.079
as the ship broke to pieces, Paul and the others hung on to pieces of wood

01:13:42.079 --> 01:13:47.079
and pieces of the ship, and they may have reached land with little or no clothing on.

01:13:47.079 --> 01:13:53.079
In fact, remember the people of Malta had a build of fire to warm the cold survivors.

01:13:53.079 --> 01:13:58.079
On other occasions, Paul escaped for his life with just a close on his back.

01:13:58.079 --> 01:14:03.079
At other times, he was beaten or stoned, which surely ripped his clothes to shreds.

01:14:03.079 --> 01:14:08.079
And at Acts chapter 16, verse 22, we read in the account where the civil magistrates

01:14:09.079 --> 01:14:12.079
it says, after tearing their garments off of Paul,

01:14:12.079 --> 01:14:18.079
gave the command to beat him with rods and then threw him into prison.

01:14:18.079 --> 01:14:26.079
Well, these accounts help us to better understand Paul's words in 1 Corinthians chapter 4 and verse 11.

01:14:26.079 --> 01:14:31.079
1 Corinthians 4, 11, he says, down to this very hour,

01:14:31.079 --> 01:14:39.079
we continue to hunger and thirst and to be poorly clothed and to be beaten and to be homeless.

01:14:39.079 --> 01:14:45.079
But despite these circumstances, what did Paul encourage his fellow Christians to do?

01:14:45.079 --> 01:14:52.079
Look at verse 16. He says, I urge you, therefore, become imitators of me.

01:14:52.079 --> 01:14:57.079
See, he encouraged them to imitate his example, rejoice despite trials.

01:14:58.079 --> 01:15:03.079
In Romans chapter 12 and verse 12, we read where he tells us to rejoice in the hope,

01:15:03.079 --> 01:15:06.079
share what the holy ones according to their need.

01:15:06.079 --> 01:15:13.079
See, Paul was able to rejoice and help others even when experiencing great loss himself.

01:15:13.079 --> 01:15:18.079
Now, many of our dear brothers and sisters have been affected by terrible disasters.

01:15:18.079 --> 01:15:21.079
Just consider a few over the past year.

01:15:21.079 --> 01:15:29.079
Now, earthquakes in Albania, the Philippines, Puerto Rico and elsewhere, a severe flooding in Congo,

01:15:29.079 --> 01:15:39.079
Spain, the United States, hurricanes and typhoons in the Bahamas and the Philippines, terrible fires in Australia

01:15:39.079 --> 01:15:42.079
and the United States and the list goes on and on.

01:15:42.079 --> 01:15:47.079
And see the result of these and many other disasters is that our brothers and sisters,

01:15:47.079 --> 01:15:53.079
some of you have had to flee their homes in the middle of the night and we're just to close on their back

01:15:53.079 --> 01:15:58.079
or in other situations the disaster destroyed all of their belongings.

01:15:58.079 --> 01:16:02.079
It pains us when we hear those reports.

01:16:02.079 --> 01:16:09.079
And you dear brothers and sisters who are going through these things, please know that we keep you in our prayers.

01:16:09.079 --> 01:16:14.079
But even in those circumstances, our brothers continue to rejoice.

01:16:14.079 --> 01:16:17.079
How is that possible?

01:16:17.079 --> 01:16:28.079
Well, as you watch the following video, note which provisions helped our brother and sister to rejoice despite a period of inadequate clothing.

01:16:28.079 --> 01:16:43.779
Well, one thing you have to understand about living in New York City is that it's a very fast-paced life.

01:16:43.779 --> 01:16:47.779
So you got to keep up with that lifestyle.

01:16:48.779 --> 01:16:51.779
We were doing pretty fine and we were happy.

01:16:51.779 --> 01:16:56.779
Pine Aaron, working, just trying to survive in New York.

01:16:56.779 --> 01:17:00.779
Some of the things that you usually have to worry about is your safety.

01:17:00.779 --> 01:17:03.779
Being careful of your surroundings.

01:17:03.779 --> 01:17:09.779
But hurricanes is just something we never considered. It's something we never had to worry about.

01:17:09.779 --> 01:17:20.579
The day when we first heard the warnings, it was raining outside, kind of windy.

01:17:20.579 --> 01:17:24.579
We saw the water coming into the parking lot where our apartment was.

01:17:24.579 --> 01:17:32.640
And that's when I realized something was about to happen.

01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:36.640
We got out with the clothes on our back.

01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:39.640
We just total devastation.

01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:42.640
We lose everything.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:46.079
One thing a night.

01:17:46.079 --> 01:17:53.079
I never had any thought that the water would come into our place and destroy everything from our material possessions to our clothes.

01:17:53.079 --> 01:17:57.079
I truly felt what it was like to be destitute.

01:17:57.079 --> 01:18:03.079
It just broke my heart and all I could do was wonder where do me and my wife go from here.

01:18:03.079 --> 01:18:08.159
Our assembly was scheduled for that weekend.

01:18:08.159 --> 01:18:12.159
I didn't even have a suit jacket or a tie.

01:18:12.159 --> 01:18:19.439
I think I probably took for granted something simple as clothing. I always had it.

01:18:19.439 --> 01:18:24.439
But the brothers and sisters stepped into us in so many different ways.

01:18:24.439 --> 01:18:34.439
I would hear a knock on the door that Friday with three suits and shoes.

01:18:34.439 --> 01:18:36.439
They purchased clothing for us.

01:18:36.439 --> 01:18:42.439
It was a more unbelievable experience. These friends gave us big hugs, gave us envelopes.

01:18:42.439 --> 01:18:45.439
We are fully convinced we were clothed by Jehovah's love.

01:18:45.439 --> 01:18:53.439
We were able to go to our assembly and enjoy taking in spiritual food, even though we were in that situation.

01:18:53.439 --> 01:19:01.439
Even though we lost everything physically, we were still able to keep on pioneering which we have been doing up to this day.

01:19:01.439 --> 01:19:04.439
Jehovah made a promise.

01:19:04.439 --> 01:19:10.439
But once we keep seeking for his kingdom, everything else he would take care of.

01:19:10.439 --> 01:19:13.439
And that's where my joy comes from.

01:19:14.439 --> 01:19:20.439
No matter what type of tribulation you go through in your life, even if it's to the point of nakedness,

01:19:20.439 --> 01:19:27.439
it will never ever be able to stop or cut off the relationship that we have with our God, Jehovah.

01:19:27.439 --> 01:19:35.850
Did you notice what helped this couple?

01:19:35.850 --> 01:19:40.850
They lost everything in one night. They were unsure what they would do, how they would go on.

01:19:40.850 --> 01:19:42.850
But did you notice they resolved?

01:19:42.850 --> 01:19:52.850
Remember Brian said, no matter what tribulation we experience, even to the point of nakedness, it will never cut us off from our relationship with Jehovah.

01:19:52.850 --> 01:19:59.850
They were touched by how their brothers stepped in to help them. They kept their hope in Jehovah and the future alive.

01:19:59.850 --> 01:20:02.850
But what do we learn from this?

01:20:02.850 --> 01:20:10.850
Well, we learn that when we are going through trials, even those trials that cause us to lose our possessions or be inadequately clothed,

01:20:10.850 --> 01:20:16.850
we can maintain our joy due to the three things we've been discussing.

01:20:16.850 --> 01:20:25.850
Maintaining our relationship with Jehovah, receiving relief from our brotherhood and holding fast to our hope.

01:20:25.850 --> 01:20:33.850
Now, many of you immediately respond to help your brothers and sisters when you see a need and we appreciate that so much.

01:20:33.850 --> 01:20:43.850
A disaster is on the increase, both in frequency and intensity, and so thus the need to provide relief for our brothers continues to increase.

01:20:43.850 --> 01:20:51.850
And we commend you and thank you for what you do, why some of you volunteer to go into areas to help.

01:20:51.850 --> 01:21:02.850
For example, after Hurricane Dorian, in the Bahamas, witness pilots transported more than 700 volunteer workers into those affected areas.

01:21:02.850 --> 01:21:07.850
Others of you assist your brothers and sisters right in your own area.

01:21:07.850 --> 01:21:16.850
For example, in Congo, many of our brothers had to flee their homes and villages with just a clothes on their back due to civil unrest.

01:21:16.850 --> 01:21:20.850
With all their possessions and livelihood gone, what would they do?

01:21:20.850 --> 01:21:32.850
Well, their brothers and sisters in neighboring congregations, even though they had limited means, provided money, food, clothing, and even housing for their displaced brothers.

01:21:32.850 --> 01:21:39.850
In Bolivia and Venezuela, a congregation shared meals or local distribution of food.

01:21:39.850 --> 01:21:55.850
And look at how our brotherhood has stepped in during this COVID-19 pandemic, providing food supplies, relief supplies, emotional support, spiritual support, congregations, families helping one another out.

01:21:55.850 --> 01:22:05.850
And see, due to your self-sacrificing spirit and your generous donations, you are a blessing to your brothers and sisters all around the world.

01:22:06.850 --> 01:22:11.850
And what a slap in the face this is to Satan.

01:22:11.850 --> 01:22:13.850
Now, why do we say that?

01:22:13.850 --> 01:22:26.850
Well, you remember in Job chapter 1 and verse 11, Satan insulted Jehovah, and all of us who loved Jehovah by insinuating that we would turn our back on Jehovah when going through trials.

01:22:26.850 --> 01:22:30.850
Let's look at that. In Job chapter 1 and verse 11, he says,

01:22:30.850 --> 01:22:39.850
But before a change, stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your very face.

01:22:39.850 --> 01:22:47.850
See, Satan was convinced that when it came to losing our possessions or staying loyal to Jehovah, we would choose our possessions.

01:22:47.850 --> 01:22:54.850
Satan was convinced when it came to helping ourselves or helping somebody else, we would choose ourselves.

01:22:55.850 --> 01:23:03.850
How wrong he was. How angry he must be when he sees what is happening in Jehovah's organization today.

01:23:03.850 --> 01:23:05.850
So what do we need to do?

01:23:05.850 --> 01:23:07.850
Keep making him angry.

01:23:07.850 --> 01:23:10.850
Continue to help your brothers and sisters in need.

01:23:10.850 --> 01:23:17.850
And when we do not only do we gain happiness, but we help our brothers to rejoice as well.

01:23:18.850 --> 01:23:27.850
Dear friends, may all of us be determined to keep our joy alive by doing those three things, maintaining our relationship with Jehovah,

01:23:27.850 --> 01:23:34.850
recognizing the love and support of our brotherhood and by meditating on our precious hope.

01:23:34.850 --> 01:23:44.850
And never forget, when we continue to loyally serve Jehovah despite nakedness, despite losing all of our possessions, we make Jehovah's heart glad.

01:23:45.850 --> 01:23:50.850
And that is one of our greatest reasons for rejoicing.

01:23:50.850 --> 01:24:01.850
Now, brother Ralph Walls, a helper to the personnel committee, will now present the next talk of this symposium, we can rejoice despite danger.

01:24:01.850 --> 01:24:12.569
Our theme does not end in the form of a question.

01:24:12.569 --> 01:24:20.569
Rather, it is a statement of fact, we can rejoice despite danger.

01:24:20.569 --> 01:24:25.569
Please follow along as we look to the example that the Apostle Paul said.

01:24:25.569 --> 01:24:32.569
He was able to rejoice despite danger, and he faced many dangers in his ministry.

01:24:32.569 --> 01:24:41.569
In one verse, he mentions eight different types of dangers he faced, including dangers from robbers.

01:24:41.569 --> 01:24:48.569
While in Ephesus, Paul may even have been exposed to wild beasts in an arena.

01:24:48.569 --> 01:24:52.569
Please turn with me to 2 Corinthians chapter 1.

01:24:52.569 --> 01:24:55.569
We'll read verses 8 through 11.

01:24:55.569 --> 01:25:05.220
And notice what it says.

01:25:05.220 --> 01:25:13.220
For we do not want you to be unaware, brothers, of the tribulation we experienced in the province of Asia.

01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:18.220
Now, he wrote this while he was in Europe, Macedonia.

01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:30.220
He continues, we were under extreme pressure beyond our own strength, so that we were very uncertain even of our lives.

01:25:30.220 --> 01:25:36.220
In fact, we felt that we had received the sentence of death.

01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:44.220
This was so that we would trust not in ourselves, but in the God who raises up the dead.

01:25:44.220 --> 01:25:56.220
From such a great risk of death, he did rescue us and will rescue us, and our hope is in him that he will also continue to rescue us.

01:25:56.220 --> 01:26:08.220
You also can help us by your supplication for us, in order that many may give thanks in our behalf for the favor we receive in answer to the prayers of many.

01:26:08.220 --> 01:26:15.789
Less than a year earlier, he had written his first letter to the Corinthians.

01:26:15.789 --> 01:26:20.789
This time, he was in Asia, the city of Ephesus.

01:26:20.789 --> 01:26:26.789
In the 15th chapter of that letter, verse 32, he says,

01:26:27.789 --> 01:26:35.789
If, like other men, I have fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, of what good is it to me?

01:26:35.789 --> 01:26:46.789
His comments would fit an experience with literal wild beasts in the arena, but Paul's hope in the resurrection strengthened him.

01:26:46.789 --> 01:26:57.789
As he said, this was so that we would trust not in ourselves, but in the God who raises up the dead.

01:26:57.789 --> 01:27:01.789
He was also encouraged and strengthened by fellow Christians.

01:27:01.789 --> 01:27:15.789
He said, You also can help us by your supplication for us, in order that many may give thanks in our behalf for the favor we receive in answer to the prayers.

01:27:16.789 --> 01:27:27.789
In the congregation, we also enjoy a warm brotherhood which provides assistance and support in numerous ways.

01:27:27.789 --> 01:27:39.789
At one point in his ministry, Paul and his traveling companions felt extreme pressure, and were uncertain even of their lives.

01:27:39.789 --> 01:27:43.789
Where did Paul find support and relief?

01:27:44.789 --> 01:27:50.789
He was encouraged and consoled by fellow Christians who came to his aid.

01:27:50.789 --> 01:28:06.789
When natural disasters or other calamities strike time and again, our Christian brothers are the first on the scene to render needed assistance materially and spiritually to fellow Christians as well as to others in need.

01:28:06.789 --> 01:28:12.789
Today, Christians are not exposed to wild beasts and arenas.

01:28:12.789 --> 01:28:20.789
However, like Paul, we can rejoice despite danger that we may face.

01:28:20.789 --> 01:28:30.420
Any of us can face dangers from robbers or the threat of physical assault, especially in times of civil unrest.

01:28:30.420 --> 01:28:39.420
The Bible foretold that in these last days, people would be fierce without love of goodness.

01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:49.420
As you watch the following video, note which provisions helped one family to rejoice despite such dangers.

01:28:49.420 --> 01:29:05.779
I was born in Caracas and lived in an area of the city called Patari.

01:29:05.779 --> 01:29:10.779
In Patari, I have to live with violence and delinquency.

01:29:10.779 --> 01:29:16.779
A few years ago, we lost a pioneer sister who sadly was hit by a bullet.

01:29:16.779 --> 01:29:21.779
Well, something like that also happened to my son.

01:29:21.779 --> 01:29:28.779
There was a confrontation in the neighborhood and a stray bullet hit my son and killed him instantly.

01:29:28.779 --> 01:29:37.029
That left such a void.

01:29:37.029 --> 01:29:50.029
It hurt me to go into his room and see his empty bed, and empty see his things, his shoes, his favorite clothes, see them in the wardrobe, crying was inevitable.

01:29:50.029 --> 01:29:55.819
But these situations were very difficult to deal with at the time.

01:29:55.819 --> 01:30:06.729
But as soon as the congregation found out about the situation, right away they gave me support.

01:30:06.729 --> 01:30:11.729
They were there to help care for all the things you need to do when you lose a loved one.

01:30:11.729 --> 01:30:19.260
After going through all that, I was very afraid to continue going out in field service.

01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:23.260
I feared for my life and for the life of my family.

01:30:23.260 --> 01:30:30.979
I prayed to Jehovah and Jehovah gave me practical wisdom to continue.

01:30:30.979 --> 01:30:40.920
Sometimes when I'm alone meditating and thinking about my son, those memories return.

01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:44.920
And of course, I have a setback, so to speak.

01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:48.920
And I begin to cry again.

01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:54.920
But keeping clearly in mind, the promise of the resurrection is what motivates me to keep going.

01:30:54.920 --> 01:31:05.430
And a count that I really like and that I always keep in mind is the count about Lazarus.

01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:11.430
Their Martha uses an expression, she says, I know he will rise on the last day.

01:31:11.430 --> 01:31:14.430
And there's the same confidence that I have in Jehovah.

01:31:14.430 --> 01:31:18.430
I know that my son will rise. Jehovah will give him to me.

01:31:18.430 --> 01:31:26.260
At the time that this terrible thing happened.

01:31:26.260 --> 01:31:29.260
It's true I lost my joy for a time.

01:31:29.260 --> 01:31:38.939
But later, after the morning passes, the resurrection hope gives us joy.

01:31:38.939 --> 01:31:41.939
It is if Jehovah speaks to me saying, keep calm.

01:31:41.939 --> 01:31:45.939
It is if he gives me a gentle pat, telling me to keep going.

01:31:45.939 --> 01:31:47.939
And that's what will happen to you.

01:31:47.939 --> 01:31:50.939
Keep faithful and continue loyal and I will give him back to you.

01:31:50.939 --> 01:32:02.069
Did you notice what helped this family to rejoice despite danger?

01:32:02.069 --> 01:32:04.069
Prayer?

01:32:04.069 --> 01:32:06.069
They're hoping the resurrection?

01:32:06.069 --> 01:32:11.069
The support of brotherhood and of course, Jehovah spirit.

01:32:11.069 --> 01:32:19.069
Which provisions from Jehovah are helping you to rejoice despite the dangers you may have to face?

01:32:19.069 --> 01:32:22.069
Is it your relationship with Jehovah?

01:32:22.069 --> 01:32:24.069
The brotherhood?

01:32:24.069 --> 01:32:26.069
Our hope?

01:32:26.069 --> 01:32:28.069
Or something else?

01:32:28.069 --> 01:32:33.069
In these last days with critical times, hard to deal with.

01:32:33.069 --> 01:32:39.069
We're being admonished to rejoice in the hope of deliverance from danger.

01:32:39.069 --> 01:32:46.069
We long for the end of this wicked system just as her back at long for relief from wickedness in his day.

01:32:46.069 --> 01:32:50.069
Let's look at her back at chapter 1.

01:32:50.069 --> 01:32:59.069
Feel the stress that he felt as a result of the violence, quarreling, and oppression that surrounded him.

01:32:59.069 --> 01:33:04.069
He asks, how long old Jehovah?

01:33:04.069 --> 01:33:07.069
How long must I ask for help from violence?

01:33:07.069 --> 01:33:10.069
Why do you make me witness wrongdoing?

01:33:10.069 --> 01:33:12.069
Why do you tolerate oppression?

01:33:12.069 --> 01:33:16.069
Why are destruction and violence before me?

01:33:16.069 --> 01:33:21.420
Why do quarreling and conflict abound?

01:33:21.420 --> 01:33:23.420
Why?

01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:25.420
Why?

01:33:25.420 --> 01:33:28.420
How long?

01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:35.020
But note what he recorded in chapter 2, verse 3.

01:33:35.020 --> 01:33:44.020
For the vision is yet for its appointed time, and it is rushing toward its end, and it will not lie.

01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:50.020
Even if it should delay, keep in the expectation of it.

01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:56.020
For it will, without fail come true, it will not be late.

01:33:56.020 --> 01:34:05.020
Like Habakkuk, we trust in Jehovah, and have the assurance that he will soon end violence.

01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:12.020
Habakkuk took the initiative to draw close to Jehovah, his trusted friend and father.

01:34:12.020 --> 01:34:17.020
He did not just fret over his situation, relying on his own understanding.

01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:22.020
Instead, he prayed about his feelings and worries.

01:34:22.020 --> 01:34:25.020
That's a good example for us.

01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:32.020
Notice his resolve in chapter 3 and verse 18.

01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:34.020
There he says,

01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:39.020
As for me, I will exalt in Jehovah.

01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:44.020
I will be joyful in the God of my salvation.

01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:55.420
Today, Jehovah, the hear of prayer, invites us to show our trust by prayerfully sharing our concerns with him.

01:34:55.420 --> 01:34:59.420
Jehovah did not approve Habakkuk for expressing his anxieties.

01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:06.420
He had them recorded, likely to show that it is only natural for us to have such feelings at times.

01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:09.420
But Jehovah wants us to call out to him.

01:35:09.420 --> 01:35:19.420
Doing so will help us to experience Jehovah's response, his warm embrace by means of his kind guidance.

01:35:19.420 --> 01:35:26.420
He will help us to know his thoughts, no matter what afflicts us.

01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:32.420
Our heart-filled prayers are one of the deepest expressions of our trust in God.

01:35:32.420 --> 01:35:40.420
We rejoice in knowing that Jehovah is eager to deliver us from all forms of danger.

01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:49.279
Brother David Schaefer, a helper to the Teaching Committee, will now present the final talk of this symposium.

01:35:49.279 --> 01:36:00.869
We can rejoice, despite sword.

01:36:00.869 --> 01:36:05.869
During his first imprisonment in Rome, from about 59 to 61 CE,

01:36:05.869 --> 01:36:12.869
the Apostle Paul was permitted to stay in his own hired house, though he was constantly guarded by a soldier.

01:36:12.869 --> 01:36:16.869
During those two years, he preached to everyone who came to him,

01:36:16.869 --> 01:36:24.869
and he wrote inspired letters to the Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Philemon, and evidently Hebrews too.

01:36:25.869 --> 01:36:28.869
And then Paul was apparently released.

01:36:28.869 --> 01:36:31.869
Now he could renew his missionary activity.

01:36:31.869 --> 01:36:36.869
He could write to Timothy who was serving in Ephesus and to Titus who was serving on Crete.

01:36:36.869 --> 01:36:43.869
Soon, though, Roman Emperor Nero reportedly blamed Christians for the fire that destroyed much of Rome.

01:36:43.869 --> 01:36:48.869
And once again, Paul found himself in chains.

01:36:48.869 --> 01:36:55.869
After decades of faithful Christian service, the year was 65 CE.

01:36:55.869 --> 01:36:57.869
How did Paul feel?

01:36:57.869 --> 01:37:03.869
We get our answer by reading from his second letter to Timothy, which he wrote from prison.

01:37:03.869 --> 01:37:08.869
Turn, please, to second Timothy, chapter 4.

01:37:08.869 --> 01:37:14.869
Did the men who apprehended Paul carry swords? No doubt.

01:37:14.869 --> 01:37:23.869
Did seeing those swords remind Paul how King Herodic grip of the first had executed James the brother of John by sword?

01:37:23.869 --> 01:37:25.869
We can only imagine.

01:37:25.869 --> 01:37:32.869
But from this excerpt from second Timothy, we see that Paul sensed that his own execution was imminent.

01:37:32.869 --> 01:37:36.869
And we also see something else.

01:37:36.869 --> 01:37:42.869
Here we see the three things that strengthened Paul as he faced execution.

01:37:42.869 --> 01:37:49.869
Please read with me second Timothy, chapter 4, verses 6 through 8.

01:37:49.869 --> 01:37:53.869
For I am already being poured out like a drink offering.

01:37:53.869 --> 01:38:04.869
And the time for my releasing is imminent, that is to say his death, which would allow for his eventual resurrection to Christ's heavenly kingdom.

01:38:04.869 --> 01:38:08.869
And verse 7 continues, I have fought the fine fight.

01:38:08.869 --> 01:38:12.869
I have run the race to the finish, the finish.

01:38:12.869 --> 01:38:21.869
Yes, Paul sensed that he was approaching a triumphant end to his personal race.

01:38:21.869 --> 01:38:25.869
He continues, I have observed the faith.

01:38:25.869 --> 01:38:30.869
From this time on, there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness.

01:38:30.869 --> 01:38:34.869
And here we see Paul's strong hope.

01:38:34.869 --> 01:38:43.869
And he continues, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me as a reward in that day.

01:38:43.869 --> 01:38:49.869
Can you see Paul's strong relationship with Jehovah in this expression?

01:38:49.869 --> 01:38:54.869
His unflagging confidence that God's Son would bestow the promised reward.

01:38:54.869 --> 01:39:04.869
And then he says, yet not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his manifestation.

01:39:04.869 --> 01:39:10.869
Paul loved his Christian brothers, and he didn't forget them.

01:39:10.869 --> 01:39:14.869
That's how Paul was able to rejoice, despite the threat of death.

01:39:14.869 --> 01:39:18.869
His brothers, his relationship with Jehovah and his hope.

01:39:18.869 --> 01:39:24.869
It's not that Paul wanted to die. Of course, he would have preferred to live on and keep serving Jehovah together with his Christian brothers and sisters.

01:39:24.869 --> 01:39:27.869
Yet he faced death with courage.

01:39:27.869 --> 01:39:32.869
And he rejoiced in the reward that he knew was reserved for him.

01:39:32.869 --> 01:39:36.869
Well, like Paul, we too can rejoice despite the threat of death.

01:39:36.869 --> 01:39:38.869
How so?

01:39:38.869 --> 01:39:44.869
Let's go back to our theme text in Romans chapter 8 and verse 35.

01:39:44.869 --> 01:39:48.869
What is the answer to the two questions Paul poses here?

01:39:48.869 --> 01:39:51.869
Namely, who will separate us from the love of the Christ?

01:39:51.869 --> 01:39:55.869
Will tribulation or distress or persecution or hunger or nakedness or danger or sword?

01:39:55.869 --> 01:40:00.869
The answer is found in verses 38 and 39.

01:40:00.869 --> 01:40:07.869
For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor governments,

01:40:07.869 --> 01:40:12.869
nor things now here, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creation,

01:40:12.869 --> 01:40:14.869
will be able.

01:40:14.869 --> 01:40:24.869
Yes, death is not able to separate us from God's love that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

01:40:24.869 --> 01:40:30.869
A temporary pause in the grave cannot extinguish Jehovah's love for His servants.

01:40:30.869 --> 01:40:33.869
Does Jehovah still love Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob?

01:40:33.869 --> 01:40:37.869
How about Sarah, Rebecca, Joe, Moses, Daniel?

01:40:37.869 --> 01:40:42.869
What about all those who have died in prisons and concentration camps on account of their strong faith?

01:40:42.869 --> 01:40:46.869
Does Jehovah still love them? Of course he does.

01:40:46.869 --> 01:40:54.869
And he still loves the hundreds of brothers and sisters who have died in recent months as a result of COVID-19.

01:40:54.869 --> 01:40:57.869
He still loves your grandma, your dad, your sister.

01:40:57.869 --> 01:41:01.869
He keeps them in his memory. He'll call them back to life.

01:41:01.869 --> 01:41:06.869
And this fact helps us, dear friends, when we face the threat of death.

01:41:06.869 --> 01:41:10.869
By sword, as Paul did.

01:41:10.869 --> 01:41:16.869
Now as you watch the following video, note which specific provisions from Jehovah helped our brother,

01:41:16.869 --> 01:41:33.699
Bati, Michael, Dubbe, to rejoice despite facing the threat of death.

01:41:33.699 --> 01:41:40.699
When everything falls apart and when everything around you is chaotic,

01:41:40.699 --> 01:41:45.699
the one thing you have is your relationship with Jehovah.

01:41:45.699 --> 01:41:48.699
My name is Bati, Michael Dubbe.

01:41:48.699 --> 01:41:52.699
I was born in Monrovia, Liberia, in 1980.

01:41:52.699 --> 01:41:58.699
Growing up in Monrovia before the war was an amazing time.

01:41:58.699 --> 01:42:05.699
I had wonderful parents. We grew up in a nice house and we went to a great school.

01:42:05.699 --> 01:42:10.699
When I was nine years old, everything changed overnight.

01:42:11.699 --> 01:42:17.699
There was reports of rebels trying to take over the government.

01:42:17.699 --> 01:42:23.699
Those reports alone made people panic.

01:42:23.699 --> 01:42:27.699
Businesses started to close down. Services were shut down.

01:42:27.699 --> 01:42:32.699
The lights, the power, the water, everything stopped.

01:42:32.699 --> 01:42:37.699
The next few years were really unstable.

01:42:37.699 --> 01:42:41.699
In 1996, things again fell apart completely.

01:42:41.699 --> 01:42:46.699
It was all out war. This time the rebels were in the city.

01:42:46.699 --> 01:42:49.699
There was a lot of looting going on.

01:42:49.699 --> 01:42:52.699
There was a lot of shooting.

01:42:52.699 --> 01:42:55.699
The rebels were known for torture.

01:42:55.699 --> 01:43:05.840
If people were not agreed to fight with them.

01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:08.840
In a situation like that, there's a lot of fear.

01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:10.840
There's a lot of panic.

01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:13.840
Your fear levels rises.

01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:16.840
The best way to deal with it is prayer.

01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:23.840
Prayer to Jehovah, asking him specifically for directions on what to do next.

01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:27.840
As the fighting escalated and it got closer to where we lived,

01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:33.840
it was no longer safe. We had to flee and we ended up at the Orange Office.

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:38.840
The brothers were very loving. They took really good care of us.

01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:45.500
Our spiritual activities, they made sure we kept up with that.

01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:50.500
Looking back, I'm very grateful to have survived.

01:43:50.500 --> 01:43:53.500
Two things help us get through.

01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:56.500
Number one, our relationship with Jehovah.

01:43:56.500 --> 01:43:59.500
That's the only thing that keeps you stable.

01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:05.500
But then also, we were able to survive because of the help from the brothers and sisters.

01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:07.500
Those moments of trial,

01:44:07.500 --> 01:44:12.500
that's when you really realize how much you need for brotherhood.

01:44:12.500 --> 01:44:18.500
I have a lot of joy in my assignment at Bethel with audio video services.

01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:21.500
I love the brothers and sisters that I work with.

01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:30.449
It's all thanks to Jehovah that I'm alive and I get to serve him every day.

01:44:30.449 --> 01:44:35.449
This video reminds us that life in this system of things is fragile.

01:44:35.449 --> 01:44:40.449
But did you notice what helped Brother Doug Bay to rejoice despite the threat of death?

01:44:40.449 --> 01:44:52.449
It was his relationship with Jehovah and it was his Christian brothers who helped him to keep his hope alive through regular study, meetings and preaching.

01:44:52.449 --> 01:45:02.449
Is it possible that some of us will have to die for our faith as many early Christians did and as some modern day witnesses have done?

01:45:02.449 --> 01:45:08.449
Yes, we're not guaranteed a trouble-free existence in this system of things.

01:45:08.449 --> 01:45:17.449
And there's the very real possibility that we may die by illness, accident or the other ravages of these last days.

01:45:17.449 --> 01:45:23.449
We might die before the new world comes as many of our dear friends already have.

01:45:23.449 --> 01:45:27.449
Or we may be spared alive through the great tribulation.

01:45:27.449 --> 01:45:34.449
Either way, we need to be determined to remain faithful to Jehovah right down to the end.

01:45:34.449 --> 01:45:39.449
The one who has endured to the end will be saved.

01:45:39.449 --> 01:45:49.449
If we assume that the new world will arrive before we die, we may be unprepared to remain loyal to the death, if necessary.

01:45:49.449 --> 01:45:57.449
Similarly, if we assume that the great tribulation will not come in our lifetime, we will be unprepared for its hardships.

01:45:57.449 --> 01:46:04.449
The only way to be prepared for either eventuality is to stay spiritually strong and alert.

01:46:04.449 --> 01:46:13.449
Keep on the watch, therefore Jesus said, because you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.

01:46:13.449 --> 01:46:24.699
It's been good for us to consider more closely the Apostle Paul's strong conviction as expressed in Romans chapter 8, verse 35.

01:46:24.699 --> 01:46:27.699
What have we learned from this symposium?

01:46:27.699 --> 01:46:37.699
We've seen how Romans chapter 8, verses 35 through 39 assure us that no trial of any sort will cause Jehovah to stop loving us.

01:46:37.699 --> 01:46:52.699
Knowing that we have Jehovah's approval and love even while under trial is a key to rejoicing, despite tribulation, distress, persecution, hunger, nakedness, danger, sword, or anything else.

01:46:52.699 --> 01:46:59.699
Therefore continue to draw closer to the one who loves you so very much.

01:46:59.699 --> 01:47:03.699
Strengthen your trust in Jehovah through personal study and prayer.

01:47:03.699 --> 01:47:06.699
Keep assuring your heart of his love.

01:47:06.699 --> 01:47:11.699
Treasure our precious brotherhood and draw closer to one another.

01:47:11.699 --> 01:47:16.699
Cherish your God-given hope and meditate on the real life yet ahead.

01:47:16.699 --> 01:47:22.699
And finally, remember the inspired prayer found at Colossians 1-11.

01:47:22.699 --> 01:47:31.699
If we continue doing these things dear friends, then like Paul, we will be able to rejoice despite trials of any sort.

01:47:31.699 --> 01:47:38.699
Notice these encouraging words found at Colossians chapter 1 and verse 11.

01:47:38.699 --> 01:47:47.699
And may you be strengthened with all power according to his glorious might.

01:47:47.699 --> 01:47:52.699
Now, just how much power is there according to God's glorious might?

01:47:52.699 --> 01:47:59.699
We don't have to imagine because his word reveals what Jehovah has accomplished and will yet accomplished by means of his Holy Spirit.

01:47:59.699 --> 01:48:05.699
The most powerful force there is. And for what purpose will he grant you this?

01:48:05.699 --> 01:48:08.699
Not simply so that you may endure.

01:48:08.699 --> 01:48:11.699
Not merely so that you may endure fully.

01:48:11.699 --> 01:48:16.699
Not only so that you may endure fully with patience.

01:48:16.699 --> 01:48:23.699
But as it says, so that you may endure fully with patience and joy.

01:48:24.699 --> 01:48:31.699
And with that assurance, we can endure despite any trial, no matter how difficult it is, no matter how long it lasts,

01:48:31.699 --> 01:48:42.420
because our Father's unfailing love will enable us to rejoice, both for all eternity and always.

01:48:42.420 --> 01:48:45.420
Thank you brothers for those strengthening talks.

01:48:45.420 --> 01:48:52.420
And we thank Jehovah that he provides what we need to safeguard our joy.

01:48:52.420 --> 01:48:56.420
Let us now stand and sing together song number 9.

01:48:56.420 --> 01:48:58.420
Jehovah is our King.

01:48:58.420 --> 01:49:01.420
Again, that is song number 9.
