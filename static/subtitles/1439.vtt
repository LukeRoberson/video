00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:10.480
When a disaster struck in the north of the country,

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.789
we immediately answered the call for help.

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:32.460
Seeing our brothers and sisters in need was heartbreaking.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.460
But what really touched our heart was this spirit

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.460
of the local brothers and sisters.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.460
They were like the Macedonians.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.460
They didn't have much,

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.460
but they gave generously from the heart.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:01:06.230
When we got home,

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.230
Madeline and I resolved to show the same kind of spirit.

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.689
First, our appreciation led us to review

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.689
our contribution to the worldwide work.

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:22.689
I've come up with this figure.

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:30.700
Is this right?

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.700
Yes.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:41.420
That's just natural.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:56.340
We looked for ways to be generous to those around us.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.340
We discovered that we had the means to give more,

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.340
so we didn't hold back.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:26.719
And then our congregation was invited to help with a special preaching campaign.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.219
I think we could do a bit more.

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:38.219
Could we push ourselves a bit further?

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:39.219
I'd really like to.

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:42.219
It was within our power to help.

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:45.219
And that's exactly what we did.

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:51.060
I'm bringing too much.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.060
No, of course not.
