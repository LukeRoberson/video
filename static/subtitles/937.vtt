00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:32.530
in dark stormy seas, God's people are lit with our eyes of faith, we see beyond the clouds,

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:38.530
and know that the storm soon will cease.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:01:35.939
To the ends of the earth, there may peace and light return, from the hold by just December.
