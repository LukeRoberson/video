WEBVTT

00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:07.940
Well, hello. We're so happy that you could be with us for another edition of JW Broadcasting.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.740
My friend, Bob Siranko's here. He's going to be the co-host for this program.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.339
Bob, why don't you tell the folks what's in store?

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:19.140
Thank you, David. We have some exciting things to look forward to on this program.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.140
We'll look back at how the organization once used a different type of broadcast,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.140
the WBBR radio station in Staten Island, New York.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.140
And as many faithful brothers and sisters know, singleness can be both a gift and a challenge.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.140
How did one sister learn to find joy as a single person serving Jehovah?

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.140
Also, we're thrilled to share with you the sounds of brothers and sisters

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.140
from around the world playing music in their local styles, music that praises Jehovah.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:58.140
This is the September program of JW Broadcasting, and you are welcome.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:21.569
This month, I'd like to discuss how our understanding of this generation

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:29.569
that Jesus spoke about at Matthew 2434 has a bearing on the nearness of the time of the end of this system of things.

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:34.569
Now, you'll remember what Jesus said, as recorded at Matthew 2434,

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:45.569
he said, this generation will by no means pass away until all these things happen.

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:49.569
Now, you'll notice that there are two elements in this verse.

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:53.569
We talk about this generation, so we need to know what that's about,

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:58.569
and also what are all these things that are going to happen.

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:00.569
Well, let's take the second point first.

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.569
What are all these things that Jesus was referring to?

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.569
Well, if you look in the context of Matthew 24,

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.569
you see that Jesus talks about nation rising against nation,

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.569
kingdom against kingdom, food shortages, earthquakes, and one place after another.

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:18.569
Fine.

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:26.569
So the generation that Jesus is talking about will not pass away until it sees war, famine, earthquakes,

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.569
but is there more? There's more.

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.569
In the same chapter, Jesus talks about a great tribulation.

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:41.569
So the generation will not pass away until the great tribulation occurs.

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.569
Now, that is interesting. That is relevant to us.

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.569
But, of course, we have to know what is a generation,

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.569
and which particular generation was Jesus talking about?

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.569
Now, if you were asked by someone to identify a scripture

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.569
that tells us what a generation is, what scripture would you turn to?

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.569
I'll give you a moment. Think about that.

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.569
My choice is Exodus chapter 1 and verse 6.

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.569
Let's read that. Exodus chapter 1 and verse 6.

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.569
It says, Joseph eventually died,

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:28.569
and also all his brothers, and all that generation.

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.569
Now, what do we know about Joseph's family?

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.569
We know that Joseph had eleven brothers.

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.569
Ten of them were older than Joseph.

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.569
One of them, Benjamin, was younger.

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.569
And we know that at least two of Joseph's brothers actually lived longer than Joseph,

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:51.569
because the Bible says that on his deathbed he called his brothers plural to him.

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:57.569
But now, what did Joseph and his brothers all have in common?

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.569
They were all contemporaries.

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.569
They had all lived at the same time.

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.569
They were part of the same generation.

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:13.569
Now, suppose there was a man who died ten minutes before Joseph was born.

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.569
Would he be part of Joseph's generation?

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:21.569
No, because he'd never lived at the same time as Joseph.

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:25.569
He was not a contemporary of Joseph's.

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:31.569
Now, suppose there was a little baby who was born ten minutes after Joseph died.

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:34.569
Would the baby be part of Joseph's generation?

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:40.569
Again, no, because the baby would not have lived at the same time as Joseph.

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:44.569
For the man and the baby to be part of Joseph's generation,

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:50.569
they would have had to have lived at least some time during Joseph's lifespan.

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:56.569
So now we've discovered what it means to have a generation, what makes up a generation.

00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:58.569
It's a group of contemporaries.

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:02.569
It's a group of people who have lived at the same time.

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:10.569
But now, Jesus said, this generation will not pass, will by no means pass away until all these things happen.

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:14.569
So what particular generation was Jesus referring to?

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:18.569
For that, we have to go to the context of Jesus' words.

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:24.569
So let's turn to Matthew chapter 24 and we're going to read verses 32 to 34.

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:28.569
This is very important and it's very enlightening.

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:34.569
Matthew chapter 24 verses 32 to 34.

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:42.569
Jesus says, now learn this illustration from the fig tree.

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:46.569
Just as soon as its young branch grows tender and sprouts its leaves,

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:51.569
you know that summer is near.

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:56.569
Likewise, also you, when you see all these things,

00:05:56.569 --> 00:05:59.569
know that he is near at the doors.

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:09.569
Truly I say to you that this generation will by no means pass away until all these things happen.

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:12.569
Now let's go back to verse 32.

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:18.569
Notice that Jesus is saying that his disciples should learn something from the fig tree.

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:26.569
Now any little boy, any small child can see a leaf on a tree and point to it and say,

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:30.569
look, leaf, but what does it mean?

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:38.569
The child may not know that summer is near, but an older person who sees the leaves on the trees is going to say,

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:42.569
ah, I know that something that can't be seen yet is going to happen.

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:45.569
Summer is going to come.

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:50.569
Now you can't see it yet, but the older person knows that summer is near.

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:55.569
And then in verse 33, Jesus starts out by saying likewise.

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:57.569
So he's making a connection, isn't he?

00:06:57.569 --> 00:06:59.569
Between verse 33 and verse 32.

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:09.569
He says likewise also you, when you see all these things, know that he is near at the doors.

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:12.569
Now what does Jesus mean by all these things?

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:14.569
Well the things he talked about earlier in the chapter.

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:19.569
Nation rising against nation, kingdom against kingdom, food shortages, earthquakes,

00:07:19.569 --> 00:07:25.569
pestilences and so on. He says when you see all these things, I want you to draw a conclusion,

00:07:25.569 --> 00:07:30.569
a conclusion about something spiritual.

00:07:30.569 --> 00:07:38.569
Now when did all these things begin to appear in 1914?

00:07:38.569 --> 00:07:44.569
Now in 1914, any young boy could see the various aspects of the sign,

00:07:44.569 --> 00:07:50.569
wars, famines, earthquakes and so on, and conclude that they were bad.

00:07:50.569 --> 00:07:53.569
But what did it all mean?

00:07:53.569 --> 00:07:58.569
Only those with spiritual discernment would draw the conclusion, as Jesus said,

00:07:58.569 --> 00:08:02.569
that he is near at the doors.

00:08:02.569 --> 00:08:04.569
Now here's the point.

00:08:04.569 --> 00:08:10.569
In 1914, who were the only ones who saw these various aspects of the sign

00:08:10.569 --> 00:08:16.569
and drew the right conclusion that something invisible was occurring.

00:08:16.569 --> 00:08:18.569
Only the anointed.

00:08:18.569 --> 00:08:27.569
So this generation is made up of anointed ones who see the sign and have the spiritual discernment

00:08:27.569 --> 00:08:31.569
to draw the proper conclusion about the sign.

00:08:31.569 --> 00:08:37.570
Now one of those who saw the sign and understood what it meant was Brother Frederick Franz.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:45.570
And Brother Franz was born in 1893 and he was baptized in November of 1913.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:54.570
So as one of the lords anointed in 1914, he saw the sign and he was able to understand its meaning.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:59.570
There were other anointed ones who also saw the sign and understood its meaning.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:05.820
Joseph Rutherford, A. H. McMillan.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:10.320
W. E. Van Ambre.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:15.320
After 1914, others were anointed with Holy Spirit.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:30.320
These include such well-known brothers as Nathan Nor, Lyman Swingle, Grant Souter, Milton Henshel, and George Ganges.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.320
They were anointed contemporaries of some in the first group.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:39.320
So really these brothers make up part of the second group of the generation.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:44.320
That is significant and we'll come back to it in a moment.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.320
Would you like an easy way to keep the generation straight?

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:54.320
An easy way is to consider the situation of Brother Fred W. Franz.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.320
Now you'll see that he is F. W. F. on the chart.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.320
Now as we said before, Brother Franz was born in 1893.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.320
He was baptized in November of 1913.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:13.320
So as one of the lords anointed in 1914, he saw the sign and he understood what the sign meant.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.320
Now Brother Franz lived a long life.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:22.320
He finished his earthly course at 99 years of age in 1992.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:31.320
Now do you know of many who were of the anointed in 1914 and who outlived Brother Franz?

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.320
There may have been some, but not many.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:42.320
Now just for the sake of argument, suppose that we assume that Brother Franz was the last of that first group of anointed ones.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:50.320
That is the group of anointed ones who were anointed in 1914, who saw the sign and then continued serving faithfully.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.320
Now we're not saying Brother Franz was, we just don't know.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.320
But for the sake of argument, let's suppose.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:04.320
In order to be part of this generation, someone would have had to have been anointed before 1992,

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:10.320
because he would have to have been a contemporary of some of the first group.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:16.320
Now again, we're not saying that Brother Franz was the last of this group,

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.320
but we're just using this for the sake of argument as a point of reference.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:28.320
Anyone anointed after 1992 would be of the anointed, but he would not be part of this generation.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:35.320
And Jesus said, this generation will not pass away until all these things happen.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:40.320
Are you beginning to see how this all connects with the urgency of our times?

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:46.320
Someone might say, we know that some of the anointed will be on the earth when the great tribulation breaks out,

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:51.320
but who's to say that Jehovah won't be anointing more people years from now?

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:57.320
And then they'll be reading about us in some updated version of the Proclamers book.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.320
Well, the answer is simple.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:06.320
Anyone anointed years from now would not have been a contemporary of those of the first group of anointed ones,

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.320
because they have passed off the scene.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:15.320
And Jesus said, this generation will not pass away until all these things happen.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:20.320
They would not have been part of the generation.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:24.320
Now those of the second group of anointed ones are getting older.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.320
This is especially clear when you consider who make up the second group.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.320
We saw some pictures of those who made up the second group, but in addition,

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:39.320
there are Carl Klein, John Barr, Albert Schroeder.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:44.320
All of the current members of the governing body are also part of this generation,

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.320
and some of us are showing our age.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:53.320
So, brothers, we are indeed living deep in the time of the end.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.320
Now is no time for any of us to get weary.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.320
So, let's all heed Jesus' counsel.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.320
The counsel found at Matthew 24-42.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:09.320
Keep on the watch, therefore, because you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.320
Now we're in for a real treat.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:16.320
Brother Sri Lanka is going to introduce a report about some who are keeping on the watch

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.320
as they preach to people in remote areas.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.320
Bob, why don't you tell us about it?

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.320
Thank you.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:26.320
In our ministry, we try to find people no matter what obstacles lie ahead.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:32.320
Unlike Nicaragua, a group of missionaries, pioneers, and publishers travel by boat

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:39.320
to teach Bible truth to families living on hundreds of tiny islands near the city of Granada.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:45.629
Lake Nicaragua is the largest freshwater lake in all of Central America.

00:13:45.629 --> 00:13:51.629
Here you will see stunning natural beauty and a fisherman or two,

00:13:51.629 --> 00:13:59.480
but perhaps most important of all are those who are fishing for men.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:03.480
Reaching on a boat all day sounds very romantic,

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.480
but it actually involves many, many challenges.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:10.480
The person has to have a blob experience and knowledge to deal to know where all the rocks under the water

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.480
and be able to drive safely.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.480
We don't have to learn just one route.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:20.480
We have to learn every route to reach everyone in these 365 islands.

00:14:23.299 --> 00:14:27.299
I remember that one time they came that we was really blowing hard

00:14:27.299 --> 00:14:29.299
and the driver ran into a big rock.

00:14:29.299 --> 00:14:33.299
Then one of the young women aboard fell into the water.

00:14:33.299 --> 00:14:39.299
A lot of the challenges have to deal with the cost because a cost you're in the boat.

00:14:39.299 --> 00:14:42.299
We had to be very well organized to find out our date.

00:14:42.299 --> 00:14:46.299
Sometimes you will go a whole morning and maybe only talk to two people.

00:14:46.299 --> 00:14:50.299
But sometimes when they would come to study with us,

00:14:50.299 --> 00:14:52.299
well, we didn't want to.

00:14:52.299 --> 00:14:56.299
And we would tell them that we weren't going to study.

00:14:56.299 --> 00:15:01.299
The brothers and sisters still found the encouragement to endure and many blessings as well.

00:15:01.299 --> 00:15:05.299
One thing that helps us to keep our zeal, even though it's not always easy,

00:15:05.299 --> 00:15:09.299
is thinking about how much people need to learn about your home

00:15:09.299 --> 00:15:12.299
and learn about this kingdom and what's going to happen in the future.

00:15:12.299 --> 00:15:15.299
And a very special scripture for me is Acts 1-8,

00:15:15.299 --> 00:15:20.299
which says that the Jews will be preached to the most distant part of you.

00:15:20.299 --> 00:15:25.299
Some older ones have helped us recognize how important modesty is to recognize your limitations

00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:27.299
and to work within those boundaries,

00:15:27.299 --> 00:15:31.299
and that way you can actually last longer in preaching in a territory

00:15:31.299 --> 00:15:35.299
that's a bit more difficult to actually get to everything.

00:15:35.299 --> 00:15:39.299
My husband and I have benefited from being here together

00:15:39.299 --> 00:15:42.299
because we've learned to work as a team.

00:15:42.299 --> 00:15:45.299
It feels good to know that we spent our years

00:15:45.299 --> 00:15:48.299
where we were able to use our energy

00:15:48.299 --> 00:15:51.299
and all of our efforts to really be useful.

00:15:51.299 --> 00:15:55.299
Something that I have learned in this assignment is that

00:15:55.299 --> 00:15:58.299
it's very important not to give up.

00:15:58.299 --> 00:16:03.299
It taught me the need to be very adaptable, very patient, tolerant,

00:16:03.299 --> 00:16:06.299
not only with the other brothers, but also with myself.

00:16:07.299 --> 00:16:12.299
It really touched our hearts to see the enormous effort they made

00:16:12.299 --> 00:16:15.299
just to visit us at our homes.

00:16:16.299 --> 00:16:20.299
We told them, yes, we are going to study with you

00:16:20.299 --> 00:16:24.299
because you show a lot of love in coming all the way here to our homes.

00:16:24.299 --> 00:16:27.299
We were living the best of lives,

00:16:27.299 --> 00:16:32.299
so knowing Jehovah has helped us to be more united as a family,

00:16:32.299 --> 00:16:36.899
especially for my mom and my brothers.

00:16:36.899 --> 00:16:39.899
Thanks to Jehovah into the island preaching work,

00:16:39.899 --> 00:16:44.899
my sons are baptized, and my husband is an unbaptized publisher.

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:51.950
I learned the truth when some brothers came down here to the islands

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:53.950
and began to preach to us.

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:55.950
Jehovah is real to them now,

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:58.950
and I often think of this picture in Haggai 207

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:00.950
that says that these are the desirable things

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:04.950
of the nations, the questions, and they are very precious to us.

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:07.950
People would talk about the witnessing in the islands

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:09.950
because it was a very touristy area,

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:12.950
so we would have boats going by full of tourists,

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:14.950
and part of the tour was,

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:16.950
that's Jehovah's Witnesses preaching in their boat.

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:19.950
That's the little floating thing you call where they need.

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:26.420
So Jehovah's name has really been made known in the islands,

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:29.420
and people now know who we are.

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:35.539
Jehovah has certainly blessed the effort of those brothers and sisters.

00:17:35.539 --> 00:17:40.539
In seven years of preaching, over 100 studies were started.

00:17:40.539 --> 00:17:45.539
27 have become publishers, and 10 were baptized.

00:17:45.539 --> 00:17:50.539
Some preaching territory like that in Nicaragua is difficult to reach.

00:17:50.539 --> 00:17:53.539
Another type of challenge is when a small language group

00:17:53.539 --> 00:17:56.539
is spread across vast distances.

00:17:56.539 --> 00:17:59.539
Over 1 million men and nights, who speak low German,

00:17:59.539 --> 00:18:01.539
live in communities around the world,

00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:06.539
and countries like Russia, Paraguay, and Canada.

00:18:06.539 --> 00:18:08.539
We are going to meet Wilhelm Canalsen,

00:18:08.539 --> 00:18:11.539
who grew up in a men and a night community in Jehovah, Mexico,

00:18:11.539 --> 00:18:20.150
and find out what moved him to learn Bible truth.

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:24.150
I was born 1993 into a men and a night family.

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:28.150
And from childhood on, I learned that God created us to suffer,

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:33.150
to work the fields, and to try to be worthy to go to heaven.

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:37.150
But from infancy, I decided to do what God wanted for me.

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:39.150
I wanted him to be pleased with me.

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:42.150
That was the desire of my heart.

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:48.150
Years back, I started to get the feeling that the memorized prayers

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:52.150
I would recite from my German prayer book just weren't enough.

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:56.150
They were not the prayers that I felt in my heart.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:59.150
Didn't even understand them.

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:03.150
I wanted to tell God how I really felt, and that's what I did.

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:09.460
All of a sudden, I couldn't resist praying in my own language.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.460
I told God everything.

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.460
I opened my heart to Him.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:18.460
One thing I asked for was that He might help my family

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:22.460
so that we could do the right thing and be safe.

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:25.460
When I finished, I felt much calmer.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:28.460
And from then on, I always prayed that way.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.460
Later, my mother bought a Bible in our language,

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:36.460
and that just happened to be when Jehovah's Witnesses started to visit us.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:38.460
Jehovah heard my prayer.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:42.460
They came on a regular basis, and it was so remarkable.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:45.460
We were amazed how they answered all of our questions

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:49.460
in our own language and with our own Bible.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:53.460
It impressed me very much.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:56.460
Then, when I was a teenager, I finished school.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:01.319
Soon afterwards, I started working at the job

00:20:01.319 --> 00:20:05.319
that was three and a half hours away from home.

00:20:05.319 --> 00:20:10.319
At the same time, I started to go out like the other young people.

00:20:10.319 --> 00:20:15.109
Looking for a girlfriend and drinking.

00:20:15.109 --> 00:20:18.109
But later, my conscience tormented me.

00:20:18.109 --> 00:20:26.450
My family was taking the Bible study very seriously, but I didn't.

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:29.450
But suddenly, things changed.

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:33.450
In January 2010, our family attended a district convention,

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:36.450
and that was very special for me.

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:40.450
It was so different from what I was used to.

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:45.450
The brothers came and welcomed me and treated me so kindly.

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:48.450
It was just amazing.

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:50.450
I could hardly believe it.

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:53.450
And the music they had, that was what touched my heart.

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:56.450
I liked it so much.

00:20:56.450 --> 00:21:00.450
That was something I never forgot in all my life.

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:05.450
In July 2010, I started to regularly attend the meetings as well.

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:09.450
Then, brother asked me if I would like to study the Bible with him.

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:12.450
Using the book, what does the Bible really teach?

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:17.450
I then realized I had to do more if I wanted to please God.

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:20.450
It would have been good to attend every meeting,

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:23.450
but since I worked far away, I could not.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:26.450
I could only attend the meetings on Sundays.

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:30.450
So, I decided to ask my boss if he could give me a different job,

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:31.450
but that didn't work.

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:34.450
It didn't want to make the change.

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:36.450
I wanted it for a little while.

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:39.450
I thought I would try asking again.

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:44.450
This time, I asked him if I could attend the meeting in a congregation

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:46.450
that was near my work.

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:49.450
But he didn't want to let me do that either.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:51.450
And there was something else.

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:58.450
He wanted to give me a large bonus if I would work for him until the end of the year.

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:02.450
But I thought to myself, if I go on working,

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:05.450
what will this show regarding my decision making?

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:09.450
If Jehovah's Day comes, what do I show as more important for me?

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:11.450
Jehovah or my work?

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:13.450
And so the decision was made.

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:16.450
After I resigned my work, I brought all my things home

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:20.450
and I felt free, relieved, ready to serve Jehovah.

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:26.450
One week after I quit my job, I was approved to preach with the congregation.

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:30.450
And what a great pleasure it was for me,

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:36.450
a performance later, I could dedicate myself to Jehovah and get baptized.

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:38.450
That made me so happy.

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:42.450
Soon afterwards, I was able to serve as a regular pioneer

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:46.450
and even be appointed as a ministerial servant.

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:49.450
But Jehovah's blessing didn't stop there.

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:55.450
The privilege I now have, working as a translator on the low German translation team.

00:22:55.450 --> 00:23:00.430
It's the best work I can imagine.

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:07.430
It helps more people to come to know Jehovah in their own language.

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:11.430
Not in a language they can hardly understand,

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:15.430
so that they too can learn the truth about Jehovah God.

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:21.430
I look forward to surviving into the new world, together with my family,

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:27.430
to work the land and contribute to making the earth a paradise.

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:34.970
Did you notice what touched Wilhelm's heart?

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:37.970
It was praying to God in the language of his heart

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:41.970
and being able to read the Bible in his native low German.

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:45.970
That's why we do everything we can to show people in their own language

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:48.970
what the Bible really teaches.

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:52.970
But something else caught Wilhelm's attention at the convention he attended with his family.

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:55.970
It was our theocratic music.

00:23:55.970 --> 00:24:00.970
We've been blessed in recent years with new songs and inspiring recordings

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:02.970
that let us sing to Jehovah.

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:07.970
And if you play an instrument, but think playing theocratic music will be too difficult,

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:13.970
you can download sheet music with simplified chords from the JW.org website.

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:18.970
To give you some encouragement, we found brothers and sisters playing our beautiful songs

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:24.970
in their local styles, with instruments common in their area of the world.

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:47.490
You don't have to be an expert musician with a simple instrument you can praise Jehovah.

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:59.660
I play theocratic music when I'm alone at home,

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:04.660
also when I'm with my family and sometimes during our family worship.

00:25:04.660 --> 00:26:15.220
We also sing theocratic songs when gathering with brothers and sisters.

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:20.220
We play theocratic music in our local style.

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:26.220
I can never stop to think Jehovah for this opportunity.

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:37.009
I feel privileged that I can play theocratic music,

00:26:37.009 --> 00:27:22.579
to bring praise and honor to Jehovah.

00:27:22.579 --> 00:27:27.579
It generates within me a special feeling when playing the Kingdom song using this instrument.

00:27:27.579 --> 00:27:28.579
It really makes me happy.

00:27:28.579 --> 00:28:19.289
It is something we can do as a family too.

00:28:19.289 --> 00:28:23.289
Using instruments, we are able to use instruments that God gave us,

00:28:23.289 --> 00:28:25.289
which is our voices to praise Him.

00:28:25.289 --> 00:28:50.119
The emotions really play a huge role in singing,

00:28:50.119 --> 00:28:54.119
being able to sing with emotion brings the meaning of the song.

00:28:54.119 --> 00:29:25.470
Music is a gift from Jehovah.

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:29.470
Jehovah really appreciates anything that comes out of the heart

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:38.980
and this is an instrument that is very close to my heart.

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:42.980
Every where the brothers and sisters are playing the music,

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:44.980
it makes my heart very calm.

00:29:44.980 --> 00:30:19.519
So when I play at home, I feel like I also have a share in it.

00:30:19.519 --> 00:30:25.519
Playing Kingdom songs gives me a feeling that I have achieved the purpose of learning music.

00:30:25.519 --> 00:30:46.680
I don't get this piece in joy, then I play any other song.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:51.680
What a beautiful glimpse of what we can do to praise Jehovah with song.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:55.680
Of all the instruments we saw, the one highlighted in South Africa,

00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:00.680
is one that most of us already own, the human voice, a gift from Jehovah.

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:06.680
Why not include singing or playing Christian songs at your next family worship?

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:12.680
As you may have noted, this month marks the 12th edition of J.W. Broadcasting,

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.680
our first complete year.

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:19.680
And while J.W. Broadcasting is designed to benefit you dear brothers and sisters,

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:26.680
did you know that from 1924 to 1957, the organization used radio broadcasts

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.680
to benefit a different audience?

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:32.680
These two featured Bible teachings and theocratic music.

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:38.680
But WBBR radio and stations like it was a way for the small number of Kingdom Proclamers

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:43.680
to reach millions in populated areas with the good news.

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:48.680
In an archived interview, Brother Robert Hatsfeld explains his privilege

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:54.059
to have been part of that historic method of preaching.

00:31:54.059 --> 00:32:01.400
I was born in 1903 in Pittsburgh and Allegheny.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:09.400
And in a very, very interesting lifetime I've had down through these years.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:14.400
A group that I was in in the neighborhood, two of us decided where we're going to go to see

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:17.400
us radio operators on ships.

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:23.400
In order to get the license, we had to be able to send and receive telegraph messages.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:33.400
And so the two of us came to New York and we went to the RCA school to learn telegraph.

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:40.400
When I was going to school and living in Manhattan, I was going to the meetings

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:45.400
was only one meeting at that time for all the brothers throughout the home metropolitan

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:50.400
area, inside and outside the city, in a rented hall in the Masonic temple that's still down

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.400
here in Lafayette Avenue.

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:57.400
It was a New York Church of International Bible students.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:04.400
And when I told the brothers that I was figuring on going to see as a telegraph operator,

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:10.400
they said, well, why go to see? We have a radio station.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:20.400
So then a little later I came over to Bethel here to see what it was all about.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:28.400
And the brother, one of the brothers for its secretaries, Brother Haslet, came out and interviewed me.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:34.400
And I was told that I should finish the course, get my license and then come over.

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:37.400
So that's how I got the Bethel.

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:44.400
I got my license in December, came to Bethel and got involved in any kind of electrical

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:49.400
work, anything at all, and operating the radio transmitter.

00:33:49.400 --> 00:34:00.450
Brother Rutherford had broadcast in Philadelphia from the Opera House about 1921.

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:07.450
And he and the other elders decided that this was Jehovah's Provision Radio,

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:11.449
was Jehovah's Provision to get this truth spread out.

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:17.449
There was no way for a couple hundred witnesses to witness to the millions and millions of people

00:34:17.449 --> 00:34:21.449
in the metropolitan area, yet alone the world.

00:34:21.449 --> 00:34:31.449
So they decided that since you couldn't go out and buy a radio station, we'll build one.

00:34:31.449 --> 00:34:42.449
And they got together and they bought a wilderness out Staten Island that needed to be cleaned

00:34:42.449 --> 00:34:49.449
out, all the brush cleaned out, land leveled off, and we're going to build a radio station.

00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:59.019
So they built a big house, really big house, that can prove to be very useful down through the years.

00:34:59.019 --> 00:35:05.019
So they built another smaller building alongside of the house.

00:35:05.019 --> 00:35:13.019
I had the radio transmitter in the one end of it, and the studio in the same building.

00:35:13.019 --> 00:35:19.019
In the spring of 1924, the first program was put on.

00:35:19.019 --> 00:35:28.019
The programs were made up by using all the things that the society published were used in some kind of a program.

00:35:28.019 --> 00:35:36.019
We had all kinds of programs. We had to put on some music, and we had real good music.

00:35:36.019 --> 00:35:42.019
We had a seven piece orchestra with play on every day program.

00:35:42.019 --> 00:35:51.019
And then we had the augmented orchestra of brothers coming out from Bethel and playing over the weekend.

00:35:59.179 --> 00:36:05.179
We had bought a used transmitter, 500 watts, to get started.

00:36:05.179 --> 00:36:17.179
And that was enough of power with that single wire antenna that in the early days,

00:36:17.179 --> 00:36:25.179
that was heard all over a very, very large area because there wasn't many stations,

00:36:25.179 --> 00:36:29.179
and there wasn't much electrical interference.

00:36:29.179 --> 00:36:41.179
But then this first transmitter was replaced in 1927 by a brand new western electric transmitter of a thousand watts.

00:36:41.179 --> 00:36:47.179
That made a considerable increase in our territory that we were covering.

00:36:47.179 --> 00:36:58.179
With very little interference, when people would sit down with their phones and try to receive distant programs and pay attention,

00:36:58.179 --> 00:37:02.179
when they heard something good that they were interested in, they really paid attention,

00:37:02.179 --> 00:37:08.179
because there wasn't a whole lot of other things to distract them and take them away from it.

00:37:08.179 --> 00:37:13.179
That was an evening's entertainment to sit down and listen to the radio.

00:37:13.179 --> 00:37:20.179
The commercial programs, of course, were, some of them were interesting,

00:37:20.179 --> 00:37:27.179
but the Bible message appealed to a lot of people in those days.

00:37:27.179 --> 00:37:31.179
This message was a life-giving message that we had.

00:37:31.179 --> 00:37:36.179
It was a matter of life and death, really.

00:37:36.179 --> 00:37:41.179
And we know that without your whole self, nothing would have happened.

00:37:41.179 --> 00:37:53.179
So it worked out very well right from the beginning, that we were broadcasting the message of the kingdom over the radio.

00:37:53.179 --> 00:38:07.920
Brother Hatsfeld served at Bethel for almost 75 years before finishing his earthly course in 2001 at the age of 98.

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:14.920
He and others seen on that video, like Brother Rutherford, were part of the generation of anointed ones in Matthew 24,

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:18.920
that Brother Splein so clearly helped us identify.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:24.920
They were excellent examples in their zeal and urgency to preach in these last days.

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:30.920
Brother Hatsfeld also spent his earthly life in Jehovah's service as a single person,

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.920
being single allowed him to serve without distraction,

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:39.920
but for many in that situation, the loneliness of being without a mate can be difficult.

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:43.920
Give your attention to how this sister overcame those feelings.

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:50.920
She was able to change her viewpoint about being single in the Christian congregation.

00:38:50.920 --> 00:39:08.699
Life is kind of lonely right now. All of my friends got married and seemed so happy.

00:39:08.699 --> 00:39:30.349
What if I never find someone? Tano invited me for a gathering. That's nice.

00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:45.190
Actually, I don't feel comfortable at gatherings. All those people. Maybe another time.

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:59.920
I just love my job. Mark has given me lots of attention lately. He really appreciates me.

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:09.619
And actually, he's kind of cute, but he's not a brother.

00:40:09.619 --> 00:40:18.260
I really want to be obedient to Jehovah, but it's hard.

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:31.880
Marry only in the Lord. That sounds nice. I just don't know any brother I really connect with.

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:41.690
Taylor met her husband on the internet. They seem to be very happy.

00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:52.510
So what's the harm in finding a brother that way? Would it really be bad to have a quick look at one of those JW dating sites?

00:40:52.510 --> 00:41:03.699
It's Julia. How thoughtful of her to invite me for family worship.

00:41:03.699 --> 00:41:24.940
Should I join them? Oh well, why not? Julia used to be in the same position as I'm in. She understands me.

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:41.949
I love the story of Jeff this daughter. Because her father made a promise to Jehovah,

00:41:41.949 --> 00:41:54.289
she served at Jehovah's Tabernacle for the rest of her life. She was single too.

00:41:54.289 --> 00:42:02.289
And sad for a little while. But she learned to be content and found joy in her service to Jehovah.

00:42:02.289 --> 00:42:12.650
Every year, her friends visited her and were a real encouragement. And so am I.

00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:21.650
That family study really had an impact on me. If Jeff this daughter could do that, so can I.

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:28.650
Jehovah promises that. Jehovah will not hold back anything good from those walking in integrity.

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:40.119
I cannot believe it even crossed my mind to date a non-witness or even look at those JW dating sites and put my integrity at stake.

00:42:41.119 --> 00:42:50.739
Imagine what I could have gotten myself into. I'm so happy Julia invited me.

00:42:50.739 --> 00:42:57.659
Jehovah will definitely be there for me to turn my singleness into a success.

00:42:57.659 --> 00:43:07.639
It's been a while now since I've started pioneering. That decision strengthened my relationship with Jehovah.

00:43:07.639 --> 00:43:17.110
I feel much closer to the congregation. I finally understand what Jesus meant at Matthew 19, verse 12.

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:21.110
He said, let the one who can make room for it, make room for it.

00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:30.809
My singleness indeed allows me to serve Jehovah without distraction. I just love my life.

00:43:30.809 --> 00:43:49.219
Invitation to the school for Kingdom Evangelises. Yes, Jehovah really did not hold back anything good from me.

00:43:49.219 --> 00:43:57.349
Like our dear sister, if you struggle with being single.

00:43:57.349 --> 00:44:03.349
Focusing your efforts in the ministry and drawing close to the congregation can be a great comfort.

00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:13.349
And if your circumstances allow, prayerfully consider one of the many ways a single person has available to expand his or her ministry.

00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:22.349
Well, next meet a brother who after learning the truth saw that he had the makings of a full ministry right within his home territory.

00:44:22.349 --> 00:44:28.349
Bill Richards is from the Talawa tribe that lives in the northwestern area of the United States.

00:44:28.349 --> 00:44:35.699
He and others from his tribe knew there was a creator, but did not yet know him personally.

00:44:45.699 --> 00:44:51.699
I was born in the government hospital on the Hooper Reservation.

00:44:51.699 --> 00:44:57.099
And in her own member of the Talawa tribe.

00:44:57.099 --> 00:45:09.099
For many years, I served as tribal chairman, which some people know as chief or headman, as did my father and grandfather.

00:45:09.099 --> 00:45:21.099
The word Talawa means people to the north, or ancestral territories, straddles, the northern California and southern Oregon mollors.

00:45:21.099 --> 00:45:27.099
On my early years, I considered it a good, fun place to grow up in.

00:45:27.099 --> 00:45:32.099
During the summer, we have a fish run down here that's very important to us.

00:45:32.099 --> 00:45:37.099
It's what we call a spelt run. We have the yuck and the deer.

00:45:37.099 --> 00:45:40.099
We had a good life here. We lived off the land.

00:45:40.099 --> 00:45:46.099
We had salmon in the rivers. We had the berries, the acorns.

00:45:46.099 --> 00:45:50.099
Everything we needed was provided for us here by our creator.

00:45:50.099 --> 00:45:58.099
I went to school and spent forever, and right out of high school, I joined the military service.

00:45:58.099 --> 00:46:04.099
In the military, it was eye-opening for me when I was transferred to the East Coast.

00:46:04.099 --> 00:46:08.099
Their prejudice was right out in the open.

00:46:08.099 --> 00:46:14.099
And that was really very surprising to me that it could be that strong of prejudice.

00:46:14.099 --> 00:46:19.099
About that time I met Viola, my wife. We've been married.

00:46:19.099 --> 00:46:22.099
This September will be 55 years.

00:46:22.099 --> 00:46:29.099
Well, I started studying after Viola had been studying for a number of weeks.

00:46:29.099 --> 00:46:35.099
We started a weekly Bible study, and I was engaging that for quite some time.

00:46:35.099 --> 00:46:42.099
And then one of the sisters seeing my husband that he was here, and she started talking to him.

00:46:42.099 --> 00:46:49.099
Pretty soon, we started talking again, and then it got to the table, and we started a study.

00:46:49.099 --> 00:46:51.099
And he wasn't through that.

00:46:51.099 --> 00:46:56.099
You know, the more I studied, the more knowledge the energy it got.

00:46:56.099 --> 00:47:01.099
And studying the Bible early on, it was too bad.

00:47:01.099 --> 00:47:08.099
It went to community. But when we started on a regular basis,

00:47:08.099 --> 00:47:12.099
then it interfered with me and some of the meetings here.

00:47:12.099 --> 00:47:17.099
The local meetings came on a certain night and we usually have some of them who had the Bible study.

00:47:17.099 --> 00:47:22.099
One of the things that they really had a hard time adjusting to was death.

00:47:22.099 --> 00:47:27.099
Because it showed honor to the person that was their last statement in life.

00:47:27.099 --> 00:47:30.099
And that was the Havoc funeral.

00:47:30.099 --> 00:47:36.099
We could not always attend, but we showed in other ways that we did care.

00:47:36.099 --> 00:47:43.099
And we would go to the fellowship gathering after the funeral to show our support.

00:47:43.099 --> 00:47:51.099
Holidays were an extremely difficult challenge because it was a family gathering time.

00:47:51.099 --> 00:47:56.099
It was hard to make those adjustments and explain to our family.

00:47:56.099 --> 00:48:04.349
We progressed from there to our baptism, and she said, I am ready to get baptized.

00:48:04.349 --> 00:48:11.949
So I said, well, I am ready to. So we got baptized together.

00:48:11.949 --> 00:48:14.949
I was baptized at 71 years of age.

00:48:14.949 --> 00:48:20.949
Sometimes I would go to the convention and I would look around and see how many Native Americans I could pinpoint.

00:48:20.949 --> 00:48:23.949
You know, it wasn't very many.

00:48:23.949 --> 00:48:28.949
I have been told by the day that I am not seeing too many Native Americans.

00:48:28.949 --> 00:48:30.949
You know, I am looking.

00:48:30.949 --> 00:48:36.949
And he said, well, you'd better get busy and start teaching stuff.

00:48:36.949 --> 00:48:38.949
And he's right.

00:48:38.949 --> 00:48:46.949
This day, you know, if I can reach a Native American, then that's what I want to do or anybody else.

00:48:46.949 --> 00:48:52.949
Many people in our Native identity today carries an equal feather.

00:48:52.949 --> 00:48:58.949
And it's just a symbol of being protected, but they didn't know his name.

00:48:58.949 --> 00:49:00.949
They called him Creator.

00:49:00.949 --> 00:49:05.949
And now I share with some of the ones and their response if they listen.

00:49:05.949 --> 00:49:08.949
And I said, I know his name.

00:49:08.949 --> 00:49:12.949
And I told him it was Jehovah.

00:49:12.949 --> 00:49:18.949
I have a special feeling for the honk with community cemetery down here,

00:49:18.949 --> 00:49:22.949
because I'm looking at the names and all that.

00:49:22.949 --> 00:49:27.949
I realized that my mother and father are both buried there.

00:49:27.949 --> 00:49:30.949
The biggest hope now, and they even came.

00:49:30.949 --> 00:49:33.949
They expanded well to me and that.

00:49:33.949 --> 00:49:35.949
You're going to see them again.

00:49:35.949 --> 00:49:37.949
That's the being hope.

00:49:37.949 --> 00:49:40.949
Another blessing is our children.

00:49:40.949 --> 00:49:43.949
They have been attending the memorial.

00:49:43.949 --> 00:49:45.949
And then other special talks.

00:49:45.949 --> 00:49:49.949
You know, we have them join us.

00:49:49.949 --> 00:49:51.949
And that definitely is a blessing.

00:49:51.949 --> 00:49:55.619
I have received many blessings.

00:49:55.619 --> 00:49:58.619
I have a better relationship with my wife.

00:49:58.619 --> 00:50:01.619
I even take my shoes off when they come into the house.

00:50:01.619 --> 00:50:06.619
I have many meaningful relationships within the congregation.

00:50:06.619 --> 00:50:17.630
And I get to teach other native to serve Jehovah.

00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:21.630
Bible truth appeals to people from all backgrounds.

00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:25.630
In Brother Richard's case, he left his post as chief and tribal chairman

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:28.630
when he dedicated himself to God.

00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:32.630
Our program is highlighting examples of those past and present,

00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:35.630
and Jehovah has moved them to preach with zeal,

00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:38.630
knowing we are close to the end.

00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:41.630
While all of us take part in the commission to make disciples,

00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:47.630
there are also many unique assignments that support our primary work in the field.

00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:52.630
Such was the case for those who worked at Kingdom Farm in South Lansing, New York.

00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:57.630
See how their story emphasizes the need for endurance and love for people

00:50:57.630 --> 00:51:04.119
no matter what type of assignment we have.

00:51:04.119 --> 00:51:07.119
The year was 1935.

00:51:07.119 --> 00:51:13.119
Humankind was on the path to a second and more devastating World War.

00:51:13.119 --> 00:51:17.119
But Jehovah's Witnesses were busy sharing the Bible's message of hope.

00:51:17.119 --> 00:51:25.119
In 15 years, the witnesses had grown from less than 6,000 to almost 60,000 worldwide.

00:51:25.119 --> 00:51:31.119
Their preaching work was aided by a growing World Headquarters family in Brooklyn, New York.

00:51:31.119 --> 00:51:34.119
The workers in Brooklyn needed a source of food,

00:51:34.119 --> 00:51:42.119
so a 600 acre farm near Ithaca, New York was purchased and named Kingdom Farm.

00:51:42.119 --> 00:51:48.119
Those at Kingdom Farm showed the same faith and dedication as Jehovah's Witnesses everywhere.

00:51:48.119 --> 00:51:58.440
David Abuel arrived at the property on January 1, 1935.

00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:03.440
The barn was burned out, only a few horses had survived.

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:07.440
And that spring, the land flooded.

00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:12.440
Undeterred, David and those that joined him rebuilt the barn.

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:17.440
They replanted the crops and began constructing other needed buildings.

00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:29.019
John Booth, who later served on Jehovah's Witnesses governing body, arrived in 1941.

00:52:29.019 --> 00:52:36.019
After more than 13 years of full-time preaching, it was difficult to settle down to farming.

00:52:36.019 --> 00:52:44.019
Settling down meant farming by day, and study by night at Cornell University's library.

00:52:44.019 --> 00:52:49.019
I applied myself to the study of animal and plant nutrition.

00:52:49.019 --> 00:52:54.019
In time, we produced most of the food used by the growing Bethel family in Brooklyn.

00:52:54.019 --> 00:53:06.650
Kingdom Farm was finally productive, but there were other challenges to face.

00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:11.650
Christian neutrality brought increased mob actions against Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:53:11.650 --> 00:53:19.650
On June 14, 1940, Flag Day, a group of men approached Kingdom Farm.

00:53:19.650 --> 00:53:22.650
David Abuel recalls.

00:53:22.650 --> 00:53:27.650
We were put lies by an old fella who had passed by on his way to buy his whiskey,

00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:33.650
to a plan by the town's people to burn down all our buildings and wreck our machinery.

00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:36.650
John Bogard remembers what happened next.

00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:42.650
About six o'clock in the evening, the gangs started together, one car after another,

00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:45.650
until there were 30 or 40 carloads.

00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:49.650
But the presence of the police kept him on the highway.

00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:54.650
The Witnesses were determined to stay on the property and wait it out.

00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:58.650
Late in the night, a frustrated mob finally disbanded.

00:53:58.650 --> 00:54:06.960
After that night, the Witnesses continued to reach out to their neighbors through their ministry and caring spirit.

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:12.960
By the 1970s, others, like Harlan Shock, were still making the effort.

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:18.960
I learned that a man that was involved in a mob action in 1940 later became a witness.

00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:25.960
That inspired me to get to know the neighbors better and to offer other farmers help whenever there was a need.

00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:28.960
Of course, they offered the same kindness as later on.

00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:30.960
That made me feel good.

00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:40.670
By 1974, primary farm operations had moved to Walkill, New York,

00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:44.670
as did many of Kingdom Farm's long-time workers.

00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:48.949
They took their cherished memories with them.

00:54:48.949 --> 00:54:55.619
They left behind a history of faith and dedication.

00:54:55.619 --> 00:55:07.380
Kingdom Farm was used to advance Kingdom interest for 80 years until its recent sale

00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:10.380
in March of 2015.

00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:17.380
Many who served there like Brother John Booth were also part of the anointed generation of Matthew 24.

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:20.380
Although it was primarily a farming assignment,

00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:26.380
did you notice the attention our brothers paid to giving a thorough witness despite opposition?

00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:31.380
Kingdom Farm was also the original home of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead,

00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:36.380
training the first class of missionaries there in 1943.

00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:40.380
While a missionary assignment often includes learning a foreign language,

00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:46.380
some of us can learn a language that would help reach people with the truth right in our own circuit.

00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:49.380
Let's meet fellow believer and Helica Pintado,

00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:57.199
who overcame something that held her back from joining a language group in her area.

00:55:57.199 --> 00:55:59.199
My name is Angelica Pintado.

00:55:59.199 --> 00:56:04.199
I was born in Ecuador and I moved to New York in the year 2001.

00:56:05.199 --> 00:56:11.199
I have been a regular pioneer for a few years now and it has always been my desire to do more for Jehovah.

00:56:11.199 --> 00:56:16.199
Something that helped me was a conversation I had with a circuit overseer,

00:56:16.199 --> 00:56:25.199
where he encouraged me to learn a new language so that I could help others learn about Jehovah in their mother tongue.

00:56:25.199 --> 00:56:29.199
Now that I have decided to join the Guarani group,

00:56:29.199 --> 00:56:34.199
I have seen clearly how Jehovah has molded me as the great potter.

00:56:34.199 --> 00:56:38.199
One of the challenges I had in the beginning was fear,

00:56:38.199 --> 00:56:41.199
but I continue to trust in Jehovah.

00:56:41.199 --> 00:56:46.199
And by sharing the message with other people, seeing their reaction to the good news,

00:56:46.199 --> 00:56:49.199
this has helped me to continue.

00:56:49.199 --> 00:56:56.199
I have seen how Jehovah has used me as an instrument to share the message with other people.

00:56:57.199 --> 00:57:02.199
Additionally, my first Bible study is now my best friend,

00:57:02.199 --> 00:57:09.199
and seeing others whom she has helped to come to know Jehovah is truly a great privilege.

00:57:09.199 --> 00:57:15.199
I have no words to explain my gratitude to Jehovah for having used me,

00:57:15.199 --> 00:57:21.199
and truly it's something that we can only experience if we give our best to Jehovah.

00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:30.500
Like Sister Pintado, each of us wants to give our best to Jehovah.

00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:34.500
Living close to the end means we are preaching in very exciting times,

00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:40.500
but at 2 Timothy 3-1, the Bible calls these critical times hard to deal with.

00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:43.500
That's true, not just for us as Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:47.500
but also for everyone we meet in our ministry and daily life.

00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:53.500
Often something simple, like a smile, can help melt the stress and anxiety

00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:57.500
that the person is feeling and open their heart to the witness we give.

00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:03.500
That's the theme of our new music video for this month's program, Just A Smile.

00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:28.599
We can speak on that, we can pay into thousand pictures

00:58:28.599 --> 00:58:43.480
with a kind eyes just a smile,

00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:57.340
is all just a smile, just a smile.

00:58:57.340 --> 01:01:38.820
That song.

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:42.820
Bob, I think it's going to inspire me to smile more when I preach,

01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:44.820
and maybe at other times as well.

01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:49.820
Bob, I want to thank you so much for sharing those motivating experiences

01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:52.820
of the brothers and sisters who have kept the faith in the past

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:54.820
and who are keeping on the watch today.

01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:56.820
It was truly inspiring.

01:01:56.820 --> 01:01:58.820
It has been a pleasure, David.

01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:03.820
We leave you this month with greetings from the region of Ma and Denon

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:05.820
in the west of Côte de Voir.

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:09.820
15 groups and congregations preach in a rugged mountain area,

01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:12.820
where most people speak the Yacuba language.

01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:17.820
Two teams work full-time in the remote translation office in the city of Ma,

01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:20.820
translating literature and videos into Yacuba.

01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:24.820
Publications are very well received in the territory,

01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:28.820
especially our Caleb and Sophia videos for young ones.

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:32.820
Our brothers and sisters there are preaching zealously out of love for their neighbors.

01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:38.820
The 35 publishers of the Denon Yacuba congregation organized their memorial

01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:45.820
in seven different locations so that a total of 3,117 could attend.

01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:47.820
And in a small village near Ma,

01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:51.820
two pioneer sisters conduct close to 20 Bible studies

01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:54.820
and hold regular meetings with periodic visits from brothers

01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:57.820
to give public talks and encouragement.

01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:01.820
Well, our Christian love and greeting is going back to them.

01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:04.820
And as for you, we've said it before,

01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:06.820
but we're going to say it again.

01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:09.820
We love you all very, very much.

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:11.820
Thank you for joining us.

01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:15.820
This is J.W. Broadcasting in Brooklyn, New York.
