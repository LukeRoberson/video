Nearly all religions teach that part of a person survives death.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.739
But what does the Bible teach?

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:25.100
God created the first man, Adam, from the dust.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:32.020
He had the opportunity to live forever, but when he deliberately disobeyed God, he was

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:38.500
told that he would return to the dust, ceasing to exist.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.280
What about others who died after Adam?

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.299
When Jesus was told his friend Lazarus had died, Jesus did not say that Lazarus had gone

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:48.299
to heaven.

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:54.219
Rather, he said, our friend has fallen asleep.

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.579
What did he mean?

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.980
Just as someone in a deep sleep is inactive and unaware of his surroundings.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.780
But Dad did not conscious of anything at all.
