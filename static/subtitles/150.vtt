00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:08.970
This month's theme is taken from David's poetic song to Jehovah at Psalm 1825, which states,

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.970
with someone loyal, you act in loyalty.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.969
The Hebrew term act in loyalty reminds us of God's loyal love,

00:00:17.969 --> 00:00:23.969
that is love motivated by commitment, integrity, loyalty, and deep attachment.

00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:26.969
So loyalty is more than just a feeling.

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:29.969
It is active. It's rooted in love.

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:36.969
How comforting it is to know that Jehovah lovingly attaches himself to those who are loyal to him.

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:41.969
What motivated David to write the words at Psalm 1825?

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:50.969
The superscription reveals that it was composed after Jehovah rescued him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul.

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:58.969
Think of the great joy and relief he must have felt after experiencing firsthand Jehovah's loyal love and mighty saving acts.

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.969
However, throughout his life, David experienced disloyalty at its worst.

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:14.969
From his king Saul, from his wife Michael, from his trusted counselor Ahithofel, and from his son Absalom.

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:19.969
He felt the deep hurt of betrayal by those he trusted and loved most.

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:22.969
Loyalty is a choice.

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:25.969
What do we find when we look back at David's life?

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:29.969
David chose to stay loyal to God.

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:35.969
From a humble shepherd boy carrying for his sheep to a valiant king carrying for the nation,

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:41.969
he proved to be someone loyal, a man agreeable to Jehovah's heart.

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:47.969
But it can be a real test to maintain loyalty to God when we face injustices.

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:53.969
Imagine the desperate situation that David and his mighty warriors experienced when they were fugitives,

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:57.969
forced to hide in the wilderness, often low on provisions.

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.969
They saw firsthand King Saul's jealous rage.

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:08.969
But what choice did David make when urged by his men to seize the opportunity to take Saul's life?

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:14.969
Notice what David told his men at first Samuel 24 and verse 6.

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:22.969
It is unthinkable from Jehovah's standpoint that I should do such a thing to my Lord, the anointed of Jehovah,

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:28.969
by lifting my hand against him for he is the anointed of Jehovah.

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:34.969
David knew that if he remained loyal, Jehovah would remain loyal to him.

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:36.969
He would show him loyal love.

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:42.969
He humbly put aside his personal feelings and viewed matters from Jehovah's perspective.

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:47.969
He chose to wait patiently for Jehovah to act in loyalty.

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:56.969
We'll soon be facing life-changing events for told in the Bible that will test our loyalty to Jehovah and his organization.

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:59.969
So now is the time to strengthen our loyalty.

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:07.969
As we do, we can be sure that Jehovah knows our circumstances, perhaps injustices we have experienced,

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:10.969
and will reward our loyal service.

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:16.969
So ask yourself, what loyal actions will motivate Jehovah to be loyal to me?

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:19.969
Let's consider three areas.

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:24.969
First, we can be loyal to Jehovah by defending him.

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:27.969
But Jehovah is a sovereign of the universe.

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:29.969
How can we come to his defense?

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:34.969
We can learn how from the fine example of a lie who.

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:39.969
In the book of Job, a lie who listened patiently as Job and his three false confidors spoke.

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:46.969
Notice a lie who's reaction at Job 32 verses 2 and 3.

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:53.969
His anger blazed against Job for trying to prove himself right rather than God.

00:03:53.969 --> 00:04:02.969
He was also very angry with Job's three companions because they could not find an answer but had declared God wicked.

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:07.969
A fire of righteous indignation was burning inside young a lie who.

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:14.969
In Job 36 verses 2 and 3, he loyally comes to Jehovah's defense saying,

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:21.970
be patient with me a little longer while I explain for I still have words to speak on God's behalf.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:28.970
I will speak comprehensively about what I know and I will ascribe righteousness to my maker.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:35.970
A lie who courageously proved loyal by praising and yes, defending God.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.970
Why do we need to come to Jehovah's defense today?

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.970
Because our loving Heavenly Father is blasphemed in so many ways.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.970
False religions claim that he's part of a Trinity and that he torments people eternally in burning hell.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.970
Others say that he does not exist or if he does, he doesn't really care about us.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.970
We know that such lies come from Satan the devil.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:07.970
We demonstrate our loyalty by speaking in defense of Jehovah, thereby proving Satan the liar that he is.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:16.970
We boldly and zealously proclaim that he does exist as the Almighty God and that he is wise, just and loving,

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:22.970
and that he will soon bring an end to all evil and reward his loyal ones with eternal life.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:32.970
Jehovah could make the stones cry out in defense, yet he honors his loyal witnesses, you and me, with this fine privilege.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:40.970
Second, we can be loyal to Jehovah by being loyal to the faithful and discreet slave, the governing body.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:48.970
Jehovah and Jesus are using the faithful and discreet slave to feed us spiritually, so we owe our loyalty to that slave.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.970
But some may say, isn't the governing body made up of imperfect men?

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.970
Yes, it is.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.970
The last perfect person to walk the earth was Jesus himself.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.970
There is no perfect person or organization on the globe.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:10.970
But as a long time faithful brother used to say, this is the best imperfect organization on earth.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.970
Jesus didn't say the slave would be infallible.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.970
He said it would be faithful and discreet.

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:25.970
The way we listen to and obey the faithful slave has a direct bearing on the strength of our friendship with God.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.970
In fact, it means our very life.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:35.279
But what if the governing body serves some spiritual food that is not to our liking?

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:42.279
Or what if we do not fully understand or agree with a clarification of a belief?

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:48.279
On one occasion, Jesus followers, including the Apostle Peter, were confronted with a new teaching.

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:51.279
How did most react?

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:54.279
Notice John 6 and verse 60.

00:06:54.279 --> 00:07:00.279
It states, when they heard this, many of his disciples said, this speech is shocking.

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:02.279
Who can listen to it?

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:06.279
The result? Continuing in verse 66.

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:13.279
Because of this, many of his disciples went off to the things behind and would no longer walk with him.

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:19.279
But how did Peter respond when Jesus asked them, are you too stumbled?

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:27.279
At John 6, 68, we read, Simon Peter answered him, Lord, whom shall we go away to?

00:07:27.279 --> 00:07:31.279
You have sayings of everlasting life.

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:33.279
What loyalty?

00:07:33.279 --> 00:07:38.279
Peter's loyalty was based on solid evidence that Jesus was the Messiah.

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:41.279
His loyalty was evidence of his faith.

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:47.279
That is the kind of loyalty we want to imitate today.

00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:51.279
There are times we must wait on Jehovah to clarify matters.

00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:59.279
In the meantime, may we prove ourselves loyal, like Peter, and follow closely the lead of the faithful slave,

00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:04.279
who closely follow in the footsteps of their Master, Jesus.

00:08:04.279 --> 00:08:08.279
At times, though, we receive counsel that touches us personally.

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:16.279
For instance, on JW Broadcasting, we receive loving reminders from members of the governing body to be forgiving,

00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:21.279
to honor Jehovah with our valuable things and to remain spiritually alert.

00:08:21.279 --> 00:08:27.279
Through the Watch Tower and at Christian meetings, we're reminded to be careful about our address and grooming,

00:08:27.279 --> 00:08:33.279
to choose good associates and wholesome entertainment, and to remain morally clean.

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:37.279
Are we quick to respond and make needed adjustments?

00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:42.279
Or do we find ourselves wanting to defend our personal rights?

00:08:42.279 --> 00:08:48.279
A situation in the Apostle Paul's life tested his loyalty to theocratic direction?

00:08:48.279 --> 00:08:51.279
It's found in Acts chapter 21.

00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:57.279
As you recall, Paul arrived in Jerusalem in 56 CE after a very successful missionary tour.

00:08:57.279 --> 00:09:04.279
You can imagine his excitement as he related in detail that things God did among the nations through his ministry.

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:14.279
After hearing Paul's extraordinary account, the older men revealed to Paul a problem in Judea that involved him personally.

00:09:14.279 --> 00:09:19.279
Read what they said at Acts 21 and verse 21.

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:29.279
But they, the Jewish believers, have heard it rumored about you that you have been teaching all the Jews among the nations in apostasy from Moses,

00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:35.279
telling them not to circumcise their children or to follow the customary practices.

00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:41.279
Well, perhaps Paul thought, me in apostate? Really? How can they say such a thing?

00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:46.279
I just finished my third missionary tour and look how Jehovah blessed the work.

00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:56.279
Nevertheless, the older men gave Paul very clear direction at Acts 21 verses 23 and 24 that he likely did not anticipate.

00:09:57.279 --> 00:09:59.279
And there it reads.

00:09:59.279 --> 00:10:04.279
So do what we tell you. We have four men who have put themselves under a vow.

00:10:04.279 --> 00:10:12.279
Take these men with you and cleanse yourself ceremonially together with them and take care of their expenses so that they may have their head shaved.

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:21.279
Then everyone will know that there is nothing to the rumors they were told about you but that you are walking orderly and you are also keeping the law.

00:10:22.279 --> 00:10:27.279
Was this the time for Paul to question their decision or demand his rights?

00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:29.279
He could have reason.

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:35.279
Didn't you read my letter to the Galatians where it says the law was nailed to the torture stake with Jesus?

00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:42.279
I did nothing wrong. Why do I have to put on this pretense just because a few are overly sensitive?

00:10:42.279 --> 00:10:48.279
No. He humbly did as they requested, although it nearly cost him his life.

00:10:48.279 --> 00:10:55.279
Yes, it meant swallowing his pride, but Paul knew there were bigger issues involved than his personal rights.

00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:59.279
He was considerate of the consciences of others.

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:05.279
But more importantly, he showed his loyalty to Jehovah and to the governing body.

00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:09.279
Do we see the bigger issue in our life?

00:11:10.279 --> 00:11:22.279
Let us be determined to be humble, flexible and obedient like Paul and thereby prove ourselves faithful to the faithful and discrete slave.

00:11:22.279 --> 00:11:28.279
Third, we can be loyal to Jehovah by being loyal to the elders.

00:11:28.279 --> 00:11:37.279
We've discussed loyalty to Jehovah himself and to the faithful slave, but what about direction we receive from the elders in our congregation?

00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:41.279
We listen to our elders give talks and comments at the meetings each week.

00:11:41.279 --> 00:11:45.279
We work with them in the ministry and we associate with them.

00:11:45.279 --> 00:11:52.279
This regular contact gives us more opportunities to see their imperfections and flaws.

00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:58.279
We could begin to focus on their weaknesses, weakening our trust in God's arrangement.

00:11:59.279 --> 00:12:07.279
For example, if you zoom in on any of our pictures in our magazines, all you'll see are colored spots or pixels.

00:12:07.279 --> 00:12:12.279
But when you zoom out, you see a beautiful photo or painting.

00:12:12.279 --> 00:12:23.279
Similarly, when looking at our elders, don't zoom in on their imperfections, the spots of ink, rather see the big picture.

00:12:23.279 --> 00:12:28.279
Why, then, is it so important to strengthen our loyalty to our hardworking, loving shepherds?

00:12:28.279 --> 00:12:38.279
Because these gifts and men are an expression of Jehovah's loyal love, as they loyalty lead, feed and protect his precious sheep.

00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:48.279
As the great tribulation nears, our survival will depend on our readiness to respond to their direction as they follow the governing body's direction.

00:12:48.279 --> 00:12:55.279
Our loyalty is not to men, but to Jehovah's arrangement made up of imperfect, but loyal men.

00:12:55.279 --> 00:13:01.279
That is a lesson that Korah, Nathan and Abiram refuse to learn.

00:13:01.279 --> 00:13:11.279
In this clip from the video Respect Jehovah's Authority, listen to Korah's defiant attitude toward Moses as taken from Numbers 16.

00:13:12.279 --> 00:13:28.009
That is enough of you, because the whole assembly are all of them holy, and Jehovah's in their midst.

00:13:28.009 --> 00:13:34.009
Why, then, should you lift yourselves up above the congregation of Jehovah?

00:13:34.009 --> 00:13:45.009
Korah and the others made great pretenses of loyalty to God, but completely ignored the fact that Jehovah directly appointed Moses and Aaron.

00:13:46.009 --> 00:13:53.009
Who, then, were they really murmuring against? Notice Numbers 26 verse 9.

00:13:53.009 --> 00:14:05.009
This, Nathan and Abiram were chosen ones of the assembly who fought against Moses and Aaron along with Korah's group when they fought against Jehovah.

00:14:05.009 --> 00:14:14.009
While focusing on the man Moses and his imperfections, they did not really see that it was Jehovah who was directing the nation.

00:14:14.009 --> 00:14:25.009
They were actually fighting against Jehovah. Their disloyalty to God's appointed men cost them their lives, but Korah's sons made a different choice.

00:14:25.009 --> 00:14:30.009
In this next clip, notice an attitude far different from their fathers.

00:14:30.009 --> 00:14:36.009
My father and his companions actually rebelled against Jehovah's Authority.

00:14:36.009 --> 00:14:43.009
Their envy, pride, and ambition led to rebellion, and in the end, they brought this honor upon themselves.

00:14:43.009 --> 00:14:48.009
My father saw glory, but his glory was short-lived.

00:14:48.009 --> 00:14:53.009
I'm glad, though, that my brothers and I took the right side of the issue.

00:14:53.009 --> 00:14:55.009
It must have been hard, though.

00:14:55.009 --> 00:15:09.009
Yes, it was, but that helps us to understand how important it is that we not allow friendships or family to take priority over our relationship with Jehovah and our obedience to Him.

00:15:10.009 --> 00:15:12.009
That's what fathers always told me.

00:15:12.009 --> 00:15:14.009
Yes.

00:15:14.009 --> 00:15:20.009
Ultimately, successful direction for us humans comes from Jehovah.

00:15:20.009 --> 00:15:24.009
We should trust completely in His choices of appointed ones.

00:15:24.009 --> 00:15:33.009
You see, respect for those whom Jehovah has appointed, shows respect for Jehovah's Authority.

00:15:33.009 --> 00:15:40.009
The loyalty displayed by Korah's sons moved Jehovah to act in loyalty by sparing their lives.

00:15:40.009 --> 00:15:43.009
What fine examples for us to imitate?

00:15:43.009 --> 00:15:52.009
May we never find ourselves fighting against Jehovah by murmuring or complaining against those who He has appointed to lead His people today.

00:15:52.009 --> 00:15:57.009
To see more of the good and the bad examples of loyalty among the Israelites,

00:15:58.009 --> 00:16:04.009
we encourage you to watch the entire Respect Jehovah's Authority video on JW Broadcasting.

00:16:04.009 --> 00:16:09.009
In review, how can we show our loyalty to Jehovah?

00:16:09.009 --> 00:16:13.009
First, by coming to His defense as His witnesses.

00:16:13.009 --> 00:16:18.009
Second, by maintaining our loyal support of the faithful and discreet slave.

00:16:18.009 --> 00:16:23.009
And third, by a lowly following direction from the appointed elders.

00:16:23.009 --> 00:16:30.009
As you imitate faithful examples like the sons of Korah, like David, Peter, and Paul,

00:16:30.009 --> 00:16:37.009
you will prove to be some of Jehovah views as loyal, worthy of receiving His acts of loyalty forever.
