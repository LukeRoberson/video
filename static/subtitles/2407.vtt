00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:14.529
I know about the paradise under God's kingdom

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:20.530
And I believe with all my heart that better days will come

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:29.379
But sometimes in this life for me, it's hard to see the things unseen

00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:32.380
I feel the love I know is there

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.380
Where my heart is in despair

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.859
But I know Jehovah's need

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:50.020
So a safe place

00:00:50.020 --> 00:01:00.789
From the heart and real

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:12.299
I'm not hurt as a comfort

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.299
And true friends who really care

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:31.030
It's only to take one day

00:01:31.030 --> 00:02:04.530
It's my runs that we gave his son

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.530
So never doubt, keep trusting him

00:02:07.530 --> 00:03:43.069
On a strength, but take on a strength

00:03:43.069 --> 00:04:04.789
We can't realize it so
