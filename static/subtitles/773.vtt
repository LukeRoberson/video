00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:10.150
There is something Jehovah remembers that we do well never to forget.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.650
It involves the way he views us and treats us right now.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.829
And all of us, including you who are graduating from Gilead today, do well never to forget

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:23.329
it.

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:24.329
What is it?

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:28.789
Well, open your Bible, please, to Psalm 103.

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.270
And the answer is in the familiar words recorded at verse 14.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.429
And just please keep your Bible open here.

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:41.229
The Psalmist David, speaking of Jehovah, says,

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:48.990
for he well knows how we are formed, remembering that we are dust.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.310
Jehovah remembers that we are dust.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.070
What does it mean?

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.350
And why should we never forget it?

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.829
Well, first, what does this expression mean?

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.229
Jehovah remembers that we're dust.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:13.189
Simply put, this, Jehovah is mindful of our sinful nature and inclined to forgive repentant

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:14.790
sinners.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.069
Notice how the context indicates this.

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:24.269
If you look up at verses 1 and 2, David begins the Psalm by exhorting himself never to

00:01:24.269 --> 00:01:30.590
forget what Jehovah has done and what has Jehovah done.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.590
Verse 3, first, David mentions, Jehovah forgives.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:43.390
And in the verses that followed, David four times refers to mercy, the tender quality that

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.650
moves Jehovah to forgive, and he four times refers to loyal love, the love that moves

00:01:50.730 --> 00:02:00.730
Jehovah to treat us as his special property, forgiveness, mercy, loyal love, they're connected.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.930
How so?

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.090
Well, mercy prompts forgiveness.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:15.729
As one scholar put it, God's mercy is the cause, the removal of sin, the result.

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:23.569
And in this context, mercy and forgiveness are part of Jehovah's loyal love.

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.409
You might think of Jehovah's loyal love as a large house.

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:32.729
Well, mercy and forgiveness are spacious rooms in that house.

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:36.370
And then we come to verses 11 through 13.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:43.530
David uses a series of three similes, powerful word pictures to describe first the height,

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:50.530
then the breadth, then the paternal tenderness of what one Bible reference where it calls

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.650
Jehovah's forgiving love.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.530
And then we come to verse 14.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:04.969
David now explains why Jehovah is inclined to show us his forgiving love.

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:09.370
He says, he well knows how we are formed.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.009
David is well aware that he formed Adam out of dust from the ground and that even even

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:20.930
perfect humans have natural limitations, the need to eat, to sleep, to breathe.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.449
But when Adam and Eve sinned, being dust took on new meaning.

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:35.009
Regarding verse 14, the watchtower once explained, David was speaking about human frailties caused

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:39.050
by inherited imperfection.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:45.129
So Jehovah is well aware of the frailties, the limitations of our sinful nature.

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:51.330
He understands he knows how easy it is for how prone we are to sin and how strong the

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.210
temptation to sin can be.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.009
But Jehovah is not just aware of this.

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:02.050
David goes on to say, he remembers it.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.449
And the Hebrew here can mean active remembering.

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:10.250
It implies a response from the one remembering.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:18.009
In other words, because Jehovah remembers that we're dust, he is moved to do something.

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:19.089
Do what?

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:26.569
Well, according to the context, to show mercy by forgiving, repentant sinners.

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:30.730
So what's the lesson, what's the meaning, Jehovah remembers that we're dust?

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:38.810
Again, put simply, he is mindful of our sinful nature and inclined to show us his forgiving

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:39.970
love.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:50.129
We might sum up the lesson with three words, limitations, expectations and dealings or actions.

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:57.050
Because Jehovah understands the limitations of our sinful nature, he expects that we will

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.250
fall short at times.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:08.370
And when we do, he is inclined to deal mercifully with us to forgive our repentant heart.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.970
What about the second question, though?

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:17.930
Why should we, including you graduating today, never forget what Jehovah remembers?

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:24.290
Well, for you members of the 154th class, not forgetting what Jehovah remembers, can

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:30.610
actually help you fulfill the purpose of your Gilead training, which, as we heard, is

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.250
to stabilize and strengthen the work.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:40.089
Now consider two ways that this psalm can help you and, by extension, all of us listening

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:43.050
in to do just that.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:54.170
First, to strengthen the work, be a force for peace and unity by imitating Jehovah's forgiveness.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:06:04.850
Now, we'll recall the three key words, limitations, influence, expectations, which affect how we

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.170
deal with others.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.610
Now, it's interesting.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.089
We often do this automatically.

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:14.970
Imagine a group of brothers playing soccer, one twists his ankle badly.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:20.170
The other brothers do not now expect him to run, kick, do body feints.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:22.649
They see the limitation.

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:29.170
They adjust their expectations, and then they deal kindly, perhaps gently helping him

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.050
off the field.

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:39.850
And yet, in our everyday interactions with others, it is so easy to forget what Jehovah

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.889
remembers, the limitations of our sinful nature.

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:50.689
To try this, when you feel resentment welling up in you because of what a fellow worker

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:59.930
has said or done, stop and ask yourself, am I forgetting what Jehovah remembers, the

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:05.410
limitations of my brother's sinful, imperfect nature?

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:12.089
You see, by reflecting on the limitation, you can adjust your expectations, which makes

00:07:12.089 --> 00:07:19.889
it easier to deal mercifully by letting go of that resentment and thus being a force

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:23.610
for peace and unity.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.009
What about the second way?

00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:27.769
Here's the second way the psalm can help.

00:07:27.769 --> 00:07:37.810
To strengthen the work, strengthen the workers, for example, by helping others accept Jehovah's

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:39.610
forgiveness.

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:45.410
At times, you may learn that a fellow worker is struggling with stubborn guilt over past

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.410
mistakes.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:53.930
He's forgetting what Jehovah remembers, that Jehovah is mindful of our limitations and

00:07:53.930 --> 00:08:02.930
inclined to forgive, but perhaps the brother is also remembering what Jehovah forgets.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:08.689
The sins that he's already forgiven and will never hold against that brother.

00:08:08.689 --> 00:08:10.329
How can you help him?

00:08:10.329 --> 00:08:12.009
Well, try this.

00:08:12.009 --> 00:08:19.569
Use Psalm 103, 14 to remind him of why Jehovah is inclined to forgive, and then perhaps

00:08:19.569 --> 00:08:25.529
use verse 12 to remind him of how far-reaching that forgiveness is.

00:08:25.529 --> 00:08:35.210
Verse 12 reads, as far off as the sunrise or east is from the sunset or west, so far off

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.570
he has put our transgressions.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:41.730
How far is east from west?

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:45.210
The close to Jehovah book explains it this way.

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:52.769
In a sense, east is always at the utmost distance imaginable from west.

00:08:52.769 --> 00:08:56.330
The two points can never meet.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:00.009
So what does that mean for our sins?

00:09:00.009 --> 00:09:03.370
One reference work explained it this way.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:12.529
If sin be removed so far, then we may be sure that the scent, the trace, the very memory

00:09:12.529 --> 00:09:15.929
of it must be entirely gone.

00:09:15.929 --> 00:09:23.450
A scent can trigger a memory, but when Jehovah forgives, he puts our sins so far off that

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:29.250
there remains not even the trace of a scent that could possibly trigger him to remember

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:33.049
it and hold it against us.

00:09:33.049 --> 00:09:40.929
Use Psalm 103 to help others accept Jehovah's far-reaching forgiveness.

00:09:40.929 --> 00:09:45.529
If you strengthen the worker, you strengthen the work.

00:09:45.529 --> 00:09:51.490
So for you members of the 154th class, as you leave here today, may you be determined

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:57.169
to use your Gilead training to strengthen the work and the workers.

00:09:57.169 --> 00:10:05.029
To that end, let the beautiful words of Psalm 103 help you to number one, be a force for

00:10:05.029 --> 00:10:13.850
peace and unity by imitating Jehovah's forgiveness, and number two, help downhearted ones to accept

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:17.330
that far-reaching forgiveness.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:21.889
The lesson for you is really a lesson for us all.

00:10:21.889 --> 00:10:27.090
May we never forget what Jehovah remembers, and while we're at it, may we also

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:31.809
do our best not to remember what Jehovah forgets.
