00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:05.139
We met with long-time missionary, Reiner Tashman.

00:00:05.139 --> 00:00:09.140
He shared some of Indonesia's spiritual history

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.140
and text us to a recent event that strengthened the faith of all who attended.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:32.460
People often ask me,

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.460
what is Indonesia like?

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.460
Well, Indonesia is 250 million people.

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:59.280
Diverse religions.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.280
Traditional villages.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:13.340
Huge modern cities.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:27.450
But when I first came to Indonesia,

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.450
life was quite different.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:39.269
I arrived here as a missionary in 1968.

00:01:39.269 --> 00:01:43.269
And after spending about a year in the field,

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:47.900
I was assigned to do traveling work.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.819
I traveled all over the country.

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:55.819
I had some real adventures.

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:07.790
Later, I was called into the branch office.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:17.030
In 1976, though, the Churches of Christenham succeeded in having our preaching work banned.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.280
We moved the branch office to a secret location.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.280
We had many confidential files,

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.280
and I copied them on a tiny piece of paper

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.280
and stored them in little match boxes.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.590
We kept on preaching, of course, and held our meetings.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.289
We even held our assemblies.

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:50.750
And finally, in 2001, a ban was lifted.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:57.219
For me, in Indonesia has been a preacher's paradise.

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:03.229
People are friendly.

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:06.229
It is easy to place literature.

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:11.229
You can even start plenty of Bible studies.

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:18.229
But recently, we had another thrilling spiritual development.

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:22.229
For years, our branch office was hidden away.

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:25.229
But it is not hidden anymore.

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:33.539
Our new branch office occupies a floor

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:37.539
in one of the most modern buildings in Jakarta.

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:44.539
In February 2015, brothers and sisters from all over the world gathered in Jakarta

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:48.539
to attend the dedication of the new branch facilities.

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:57.819
Most of us hadn't seen each other for years.

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:07.599
Hundreds of brothers and nearby locations followed the program by a video link.

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:15.069
Anthony Morris, from the governing body, delivered the dedication talk.

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.069
I'm going to ask you this question,

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:21.069
and then you just give a bold yes if you agree.

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:26.069
All joining and dedicating this branch facility to the worship of Jehovah God

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:31.069
are Grand King in the service of the Messianic King Jesus Christ.

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:33.069
Say yes.

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:49.089
The following day, thousands of brothers and sisters gathered at a special assembly in Jakarta.

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:54.089
Thirty other locations around Indonesia were tied in via video link.

00:04:54.089 --> 00:05:04.839
We've never had a convention like it.

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:17.019
Indonesia is opening up, and the kingdom work is really moving ahead.

00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:21.019
And for that, I truly thank Jehovah.

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:34.019
How thrilling it must have been for our brothers and Indonesia to go from preaching under ban

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:39.019
to now having their work organized openly from a beautiful new branch office.
