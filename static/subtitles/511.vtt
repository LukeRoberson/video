00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.309
Let's start by going to Hebrews 13, 16, please.

00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:10.650
Of interest in the English edition of the New World Translation,

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.949
the first word in this verse is a connective word.

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:20.850
And when we give attention to connective words and phrases in our Bible reading,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.350
we can gain more insight as to what the original writer intended,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.329
of course, with the Holy Spirit's influence.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.429
A question.

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:34.829
But before the question, let's look at verse 16.

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.130
It says, moreover, so that's the connective word.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:43.530
Moreover, do not forget to do good and share what you have with others

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.030
for God is well pleased with these sacrifices.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.829
So now, the question.

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.130
Is the doing good and sharing with others,

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.630
referring to sharing the good news with others in our territory?

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.630
No, it is not.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.629
Well, how can I say that with so much confidence?

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.829
For one thing, for years, when Hebrews 13, 16,

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:13.930
is cited by itself in the watchtower,

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.430
the application is not to the preaching work.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.230
Well, now let's give thought to that connective word.

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:29.329
Word moreover connects verse 16 to the preceding verse 15.

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.629
So let's read verse 15 now.

00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:37.629
It says, through you, him, let us always offer to God a sacrifice.

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:43.230
Yes, but specifically a sacrifice of praise.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.829
That is the fruit of our lips that make public declaration to his name.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.230
So verse 15 had already addressed preaching.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:02:02.030
The English word moreover is defined as meaning an addition to what was already said.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:09.030
So the sacrifice of praise in verse 15, that was cared for.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.030
But now in verse 16, in addition to that,

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.530
there's these other sacrifices with which God is well pleased.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.729
So you see, verse 15 is talking about preaching

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:28.030
with the goal to helping people become Christ disciples.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.030
Verse 16 is doing good and sharing with fellow believers

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.729
to help them remain Christ disciples.

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:42.030
Now, what do these other sacrifices in verse 16 entail?

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:47.229
Well, as an example, please find second Corinthians chapter eight.

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:49.229
Second Corinthians chapter eight,

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:54.129
this involves giving materially to fellow believers in need.

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.830
Now, it's true here Paul was writing to the Corinthians,

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.430
but these few verses about sharing,

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.030
he's referring to the Macedonian Christians.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.030
Now, who were they sharing with?

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.830
It was fellow believers.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.129
The congregations in Judea were suffering hardship, poverty,

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.129
and so the Macedonian Christians,

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:21.629
along with others, were collecting money to help with that need.

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:26.000
Second Corinthians eight, two through four.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
During a great test under affliction there,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
that's the Macedonian Christians,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.900
their abundance of joy and their deep poverty

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.000
made the riches of their generosity abound.

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.199
For it was according to their means,

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:45.800
yes, I testify, it was even beyond their means.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.699
Well, they on their own initiative kept earnestly begging us

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:52.900
for the privilege of kindly giving

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.800
and to have a share in the relief ministry

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.599
for the holy ones, fellow believers.

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.000
So this was not preaching,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
but it was certainly a good work of generosity and sharing.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.199
Now, as a side point to our text for today,

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:16.699
did you notice Paul said Hebrews 13, 16, he said,

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:22.899
moreover, do not forget, do not forget to do good and share.

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:25.100
Why do you suppose do not forget

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.199
was inserted in that sentence?

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:30.600
We get distracted.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.500
As imperfect humans, we may have great intentions,

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.699
but sometimes we forget to follow through.

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.800
Now, Paul's writing of the second letter

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.300
to the Corinthians, it was about five or six years

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.100
before he wrote to Hebrews.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.600
So now when writing to the Hebrews,

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.899
he says, do not forget, Paul may have had in mind

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:55.699
what happened to the Corinthians.

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.100
Are you still on second Corinthians chapter eight?

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.839
The Corinthians had great intentions to do good

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:06.040
and to share with the congregations in Judea,

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.839
but it seems they forgot to follow through.

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:15.120
Second Corinthians eight, 10 and 11.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.319
And in this, I give my opinion.

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:19.019
This is for your benefit.

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:22.420
Seeing that already a year ago,

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.620
you not only initiated the action,

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.920
but also showed your desire to do it.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.220
They had great intentions to contribute,

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.019
but a year has now elapsed, verse 11.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.519
So now also complete what you started to do

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:40.319
so that your readiness to act may be completed

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:43.319
according to the means you have available.

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:46.519
Well, that's a good reminder for us not to forget

00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:50.019
once in our congregation or elsewhere that are in need.

00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:51.120
Write yourself a note.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.720
When I think to do good to someone,

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.620
I send myself an email so that I do not forget.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.620
But even if we do not,

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.620
I can't think of anyone in our congregation

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.019
that needs assistance, maybe financially.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.019
We cannot discount the council of Hebrews 13, 16.

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:14.920
Think of those Macedonians.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.019
They went outside of the border

00:06:17.019 --> 00:06:20.819
of their congregation territory to give financially.

00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:24.319
All of us, whether we have much or little,

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:26.420
all of us can contribute something

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:30.120
to the worldwide work,

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.920
especially when we think of the number of disasters

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.220
that are affecting our brothers worldwide.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.519
And then the organization can direct those funds

00:06:38.519 --> 00:06:41.319
to needy brothers and sisters that we don't even know.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:48.660
Justice Paul directed the contributions in the first century.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.660
Well, in addition to providing relief financially,

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.459
some do good and share

00:06:54.459 --> 00:06:59.060
by being physically involved in disaster relief,

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.259
securing homes that have been damaged,

00:07:02.259 --> 00:07:03.560
restoring kingdom halls.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.060
What you hope is well pleased with all of these.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.360
Well, what other ways can we do good and share?

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.459
Sharing hospitality in some way.

00:07:15.459 --> 00:07:17.660
Romans 12, 13 encourages us

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.560
to follow the course of hospitality.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:26.959
And the time in preparing and giving a scriptural talk

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:32.949
that falls into the category of Hebrews 13, 16.

00:07:32.949 --> 00:07:37.949
But now what else could fall in that category?

00:07:37.949 --> 00:07:40.449
How about encouraging, shepherding visit?

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:43.649
Or helping a sick one, helping the elderly?

00:07:43.649 --> 00:07:49.180
These all fall into that giving.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.779
You recall in Hebrews 13, 15,

00:07:51.779 --> 00:07:55.579
it spoke of a sacrifice of praise

00:07:55.579 --> 00:07:58.480
and this public declaration of Jehovah's name,

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.379
preaching to unbelievers.

00:08:01.379 --> 00:08:05.379
Whereas verse 16, it refers to talking to believers,

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.180
assisting them with these other sacrifices,

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.680
some of which we've mentioned.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.480
Well, which is the most important of those two verses?

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.980
15 or 16?

00:08:21.379 --> 00:08:23.680
At 2009, Watchtower asked,

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.579
which of these two Christian activities is more important?

00:08:27.579 --> 00:08:30.680
It didn't say after a question like that

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.279
is similar to asking about a bird,

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:36.480
which of whose two wings are more important?

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.580
Well, the answer is obvious.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.580
A bird cannot get into the air

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.779
with only one wing operational.

00:08:42.779 --> 00:08:47.779
He needs both wings equally, like this bird.

00:08:48.179 --> 00:08:49.980
We need to share in both aspects

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.580
of our service to God in order to be complete Christians.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.679
Well, that Watchtower said of these two responsibilities,

00:08:57.679 --> 00:08:59.580
they complement one another.

00:09:00.379 --> 00:09:02.879
So then we can soar,

00:09:02.879 --> 00:09:05.480
knowing that Jehovah is well pleased

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.980
with all such sacrifices.
