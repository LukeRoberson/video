00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.339
Let's turn our attention to the Schiller family.

00:00:03.339 --> 00:00:05.839
Is it possible to balance raising a family

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:08.339
with a busy spiritual routine?

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:10.339
And if circumstances allow,

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:12.339
can parents reach out for spiritual goals,

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:14.339
even full-time service?

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.339
Let's listen to their answers to those questions.

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:21.769
Sometimes people say,

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:23.769
you know, what was your secret?

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:25.769
How did you raise six kids?

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.769
We got married September 16th, 1972.

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:31.769
Two things started coming quickly.

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.770
Spiritual privileges came along,

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.770
and the children came along together.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:43.770
I was made and elder shortly after the older arrangement came into effect.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.770
The kids were just part of all that.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.770
And, you know, I think sometimes I didn't know.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.770
We were doing substitute work with five children,

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.770
and I don't think they even knew what we were doing.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.770
In 1989, we were pioneering

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.769
and then we had the opportunity to help out at Bethel,

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.769
and maybe a week or two at a time.

00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:09.769
About that time,

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:12.769
Patterson was starting up,

00:01:12.769 --> 00:01:16.769
and we kind of recognized that

00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:20.769
maybe we were getting too comfortable.

00:01:20.769 --> 00:01:23.769
We went in one time at Bethel today.

00:01:23.769 --> 00:01:25.769
If you need a doctor out of Patterson,

00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:27.769
why we be available,

00:01:27.769 --> 00:01:29.769
or we could make ourselves available,

00:01:29.769 --> 00:01:30.769
maybe.

00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:32.769
And wouldn't you know what,

00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:34.769
shortly after we got a call,

00:01:34.769 --> 00:01:37.769
how quick could you sell your place and be up here?

00:01:37.769 --> 00:01:41.769
So we went to Bethel with six kids,

00:01:41.769 --> 00:01:43.769
sold our house at a loss,

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:45.769
so we could do that,

00:01:45.769 --> 00:01:49.769
and started a new life there.

00:01:49.769 --> 00:01:51.769
So we learned pretty quick.

00:01:51.769 --> 00:01:53.769
Don't turn down any privileges,

00:01:53.769 --> 00:01:57.769
and especially not because we had kids.

00:01:58.769 --> 00:02:00.769
When we went to Bethel,

00:02:00.769 --> 00:02:03.769
the oldest one was 17.

00:02:03.769 --> 00:02:05.769
Having children,

00:02:05.769 --> 00:02:08.770
kept my husband and I very humble,

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.770
because as soon as you thought you had something figured out,

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.770
each child need to be disciplined in a different way.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:15.770
And as soon as you thought,

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.770
boy, you know, I got this figured out,

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.770
you're thrown a curve.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.770
A challenge was to keep doing the basic things.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.770
You'd come home tired.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.770
It would be so easy not to have the family study,

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.770
maybe one Monday.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.770
It's those basic simple things that I think

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.080
kept us on an even keel.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.080
I often think of the illustration that Jesus gave

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.080
at the end of the Sermon on the Mount

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.080
when he said that about this foundation that was washed away.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.080
And Jesus never blamed the storm.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.080
He blamed the foundation.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.080
And so we recognize that any child anywhere,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.080
in fact, even adults, get their faith tested.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.080
So we tried to really make sure they had a good foundation

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.080
that didn't get washed away.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.080
Prepare them.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.080
Let them learn how to deal with people

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.080
while they're under your care.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.080
And get them ready for life.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.080
We got to thinking other parents

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.080
require their kids to go to college.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.080
So we just required them to pioneer for a year.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.080
Any kind of education, any kind of secular education,

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.080
can teach you how to have a skill so that you have a job.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.080
But the Bible teaches you how to live.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.080
And it teaches you principles that you can live your life by.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.080
And all of them kept pioneering.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.080
You know, they did various jobs to support themselves.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.080
They cleaned, they worked in a number of yards.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.080
They worked on roofing.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.080
None of them have a complicated life that holds them down.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.080
I wanted everlasting life for my children.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.080
And I knew I would have to give them back to Jehovah.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.080
We have to realize we don't own our children Jehovah's Day.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.080
And we have to respect that.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.079
We're not telling them what to do anymore.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.079
We appreciate and we're very, very thankful when our children

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.079
is far away as they are and as busy as they are.

00:04:23.079 --> 00:04:27.649
That they take the time to communicate with us.

00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:31.649
And I know you won't remember this.

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:35.649
I remember one time before you fell asleep at night.

00:04:35.649 --> 00:04:39.649
I said all that you have done for Jehovah.

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:44.990
What would you like in return?

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.990
Do you remember what you said?

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.990
You said three words.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.990
All my children.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.360
In Deuteronomy, it's that I put life and death before.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.360
And you must choose.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.360
So we can do what we could as parents.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.360
Some things good, some things.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.360
Not so good.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.360
In the end, each one had to make his or her own decision.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.360
And that's why, again, not any secret.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.360
We were so proud of what the kids had decided

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.360
and how they turned out because it was their decision.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.360
I think that's the thing that we've learned

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.360
is don't turn down opportunities.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:35.459
Isn't it wonderful to hear of ones like Brother and Sister Schiller

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:38.459
who have offered their gifts to Jehovah?

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:41.459
Brother Schiller said that it was doing the basic things

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:44.459
that kept his family focused spiritually.

00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:48.459
So when opportunities came along, he was able to do more.

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:51.459
That included pioneering, substitute circuit work,

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:54.459
and using the medical training he had already acquired

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:58.459
to volunteer at the Patterson Educational Center.

00:05:58.459 --> 00:06:02.459
Proverbs 10-22 says,

00:06:02.459 --> 00:06:05.459
it is the blessing of Jehovah that makes one rich

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:08.459
and he adds no hardship with it.

00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:13.459
That certainly has proved true for Brother Schiller and his family.
