00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:05.540
The matter of dress and grooming is a deeply personal matter.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.140
It's something that elicits all sorts of emotions.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.140
But let me just ask at this point, what are you thinking about?

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.140
Maybe you're thinking why does he have this hat on his head?

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.140
Some are thinking this must be a very defining moment in Brother Jackson's lifetime.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.140
Others are thinking is this a new precedent?

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.140
We've never done that before.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.140
Well, let me take it off.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:41.140
That was an object lesson to point out how distracting our dress and grooming can be.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.140
Yes, it can distract from the message that we bear.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.140
Instead of thinking about what someone is conveying in the message,

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:55.140
if our dress and grooming is just out of the ordinary, something that is shocking,

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.140
then it certainly can take away from the glory to Jehovah and also the message that we bear.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:10.140
But when we go around the world, we see a large variety of dress and grooming used by our brothers and sisters.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.140
Without showing your photos, you remember many of the watchtower photographs

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.140
where our brothers are witnessing some, don't have a tie, others don't have a jacket.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.140
In Fiji, of course, so men wear what might be referred to as a guilt or a sulum.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:35.140
So there's a large variety of dresses and costumes and outfits that are acceptable.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:42.140
And we're probably not as to some of the governing body members when they've released bibles or been at conventions,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.140
have done some of the local at-time.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:55.140
So it's not as if Jehovah's organization is so strict and inflexible that we all have to dress exactly the same way.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.140
It's true, there are various circumstances that God's people face.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.140
In some countries, there's such a variety of items that we can use for dress and grooming.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.139
In other countries, there really isn't so many things that our brothers can use.

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:17.139
I know my wife and I were very touched a number of years ago when we attended a regional convention

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:22.139
and as I was waiting to give the last talk sitting behind the platform,

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:27.139
I noticed the brothers and sisters who were in the watchtower were giving comments

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:32.139
and it really touched my heart when I saw sisters come off the platform

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:38.139
and then give their shoes and the jewelry to other sisters who were about to go on the same platform.

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:43.139
You see, they didn't have much, they shared what they had.

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:50.139
They didn't have a lot of choice, but sometimes we know some of your dear sisters particularly

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:57.139
may go into a department store and it may look like you have a huge variety of things that you can choose from.

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:02.139
But when you start looking sometimes, you may feel like those sisters at that particular convention

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:07.139
that there really isn't a lot that you can use as a Christian.

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:11.139
So what can help us? Well, the encouraging thing is wherever you go in the world,

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:15.139
whether brothers have ties or jackets or whatever they have,

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:22.139
there's one thing in common to others people try to be neat, clean and presentable.

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:26.139
And from the governing body's viewpoint, of course, you know,

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:30.139
we're not trying to make all sorts of rules, rigid rules with regard to this.

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:35.139
So what can help us to help our brothers and sisters have the right viewpoint?

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:38.139
That brings glory to Jehovah.

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.139
Well, I thought we might think of five scriptural principles.

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.139
Now there are many other scriptural principles we could look at,

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.139
but these are five principles that perhaps could help us.

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:54.139
So first of all, let's take our Bibles and turn to 1 Timothy, chapter 2, and verse 9.

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:58.139
And we're going to have this on the screen with the highlighted portions.

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:03.139
Likewise, the women should adorn themselves in appropriate,

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:11.139
and the notice of footnotes says, respectable dress with modesty and soundness of mind.

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:16.139
And again, look at the footnote, good judgment, sensableness.

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:23.139
Not with styles of hairbrading and gold or pearls or very expensive clothing.

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.139
So what principle do we get here, no matter where we live in the world?

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:36.139
Well, certainly we wouldn't want any clothing that's showy or bizarre or provocative

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:42.139
or that's revealing or too extreme with regard to fads.

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.139
Again, the principle of the hat.

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:53.139
If we're doing something or wearing something that really is so different from what was expected, what happens?

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:58.139
Well, perhaps at the very least it distracts from the message,

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:02.139
but it could be a lot worse than that, goodness, it could give the wrong impression

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.139
with regard to our morals and so forth.

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:13.139
Now, our second scripture we can look at is in 2 Corinthians chapter 6 and verse 3.

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:21.139
In no way, are we giving any cause for stumbling so that no fault may be found with our ministry?

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:27.139
Notice the comment here, no way or any cause.

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:32.139
So whatever selections we make with regard to dress and grooming,

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:40.139
we certainly would want to make sure that in no way at all could this cause some stumbling on the part of those,

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:46.139
not only outside the congregation when we're presenting the message, but also within the congregation,

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:55.139
if we were something that would be provocative, perhaps that could arouse in some wrong desires.

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:02.139
So having that in mind, it gives us a good principle with regard to selection of dress and grooming.

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:09.139
Now, third principle is found in the book of Numbers 15 verse 39.

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:13.139
And we might say this is in the context of the Israelite nation

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:19.139
where Jehovah did give them some strict laws with regard to dress and grooming,

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:24.139
laws that made sure that the Israelites would be different from the nations around them.

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:27.139
So let's read Numbers 15 39.

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:34.139
You must have this fringed edge so that you will see it and remember all the commandments of Jehovah and observe them.

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:40.139
And notice this point, you must not follow your own hearts and eyes,

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:44.139
which are leading you to spiritual prostitution.

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:47.139
Now, that's a very interesting principle, isn't it?

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:53.139
We're not for one minute suggesting we have to have these fringed edges on our garments today.

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:55.139
But what's the thought?

00:06:55.139 --> 00:07:03.139
Jehovah was telling them, when you're selecting what you wear, just don't follow your hearts and eyes.

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:07.139
In other words, we shouldn't feel well.

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:12.139
I really like this. This is just nice. It suits me.

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:17.139
It reflects the colors of my skin or whatever other feelings we may have.

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:22.139
But rather, there are a lot more factors to taking the consideration.

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:28.139
Now, doubt there were some back in Israelite times that didn't like a fringe on the edge of their garments.

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:33.139
But having in mind what Jehovah wants helped them to see what they needed to do.

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:38.139
So that principle is a good principle for us today to ask such questions as,

00:07:38.139 --> 00:07:41.139
will this raise eyebrows?

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:45.139
Will it lower the standards that I have?

00:07:45.139 --> 00:07:48.139
Does it fit?

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:52.139
Is it the appropriate dress for my age?

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:57.139
Those are important questions that all of us need to think of.

00:07:57.139 --> 00:08:04.139
Well, a fourth principle is found in 1 Corinthians chapter 10 and verses 23 and 24.

00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:10.139
And again, it's one of the principles perhaps we would have thought of when we're thinking about this subject.

00:08:10.139 --> 00:08:16.139
All things are lawful, but not all things are advantageous.

00:08:16.139 --> 00:08:20.139
All things are lawful, but not all things build up.

00:08:20.139 --> 00:08:26.139
Let each one keep seeking not his own advantage, but that of the other person.

00:08:27.139 --> 00:08:31.139
So again, what type of questions would we need to ask?

00:08:31.139 --> 00:08:40.139
Well, perhaps this selection we've made is not so bad that we're going to have someone come and talk to us about it.

00:08:40.139 --> 00:08:42.139
But is it a building?

00:08:42.139 --> 00:08:46.139
Does it represent Jehovah in a fine manner?

00:08:46.139 --> 00:08:52.139
And we could say not only at times of worship when we're in the kingdom hall or when we're witnessing,

00:08:52.139 --> 00:08:55.139
but also when we're relaxing.

00:08:55.139 --> 00:09:03.139
Would someone be shocked to find out that we're one of Jehovah's Witnesses when we're on vacation because of the way that we're dressed?

00:09:03.139 --> 00:09:06.139
Well, those are interesting questions, aren't they?

00:09:06.139 --> 00:09:14.139
And the final scripture that perhaps gives us a little direction is in Philippians chapter 3 and verse 17.

00:09:14.139 --> 00:09:19.139
Here Paul says, you're not only become imitators of me brothers,

00:09:19.139 --> 00:09:26.139
and keep your eye on those who are walking in a way that is in harmony with the example we set for you.

00:09:26.139 --> 00:09:29.139
Now, what's the thought behind that principle?

00:09:29.139 --> 00:09:34.139
Well, if we have questions in our mind with regard to dress and grooming,

00:09:34.139 --> 00:09:39.139
it's good for us to look at those who are mature in the congregation.

00:09:39.139 --> 00:09:42.139
Yes, what do they wear?

00:09:42.139 --> 00:09:46.139
What standards have been set within the congregation as a whole?

00:09:46.139 --> 00:09:51.139
And that will give us some idea as to what type of clothing we should wear.

00:09:51.139 --> 00:09:54.139
So, brothers and sisters, particularly the Bethel family,

00:09:54.139 --> 00:09:58.139
we commend you for the dress and grooming that you display.

00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:01.139
We know that it does bring honor to Jehovah,

00:10:01.139 --> 00:10:05.139
but let's always keep in mind these basic principles.

00:10:05.139 --> 00:10:08.139
Yes, without making a whole lot of rigid laws,

00:10:08.139 --> 00:10:12.139
let's always do things to Jehovah's glory.
