00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:06.660
Welcome to JW Broadcasting. Here is what we can look forward to on the program

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.259
this month. Why do we need to be quick to address problems when they arise? We

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.739
will highlight the benefits. And our music video will encourage us to reach out

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:22.500
to expand our ministry. We will also find out how our brothers and sisters

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.899
reached out to the visitors that came to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:51.409
Brazil last year. This is the September program of JW Broadcasting. The theme

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:57.530
selected for my comments this month is punctuality, a godly quality. You might

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.369
remember the opening paragraph and a 1990 watchtower article on the subject of

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:08.930
punctuality. It said that an elder's closest friends jokingly called him

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:17.209
Armageddon. Why? They replied we know he's coming but only God knows when. The

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:22.689
elder had a problem with punctuality. Punctuality has nothing in common with

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:29.609
procrastination. To procrastinate means to intentionally put off the doing of

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:35.530
something that should be done. The saying tomorrow is the busiest day of the

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.049
year reflects the human tendency to procrastinate. How appropriate then is the

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:48.370
inspired encouragement concerning the present today. Galatians 6.10 says as

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:55.810
long as we have the opportunity let us work what is good toward all. As long as

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.170
we have the opportunity does not sound like procrastination to me. Know the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.290
Bible encourages just the opposite punctuality. Punctuality refers to the

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.810
characteristic of being prompt in keeping appointments. Punctuality is a godly

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:21.849
quality. In fact Matthew 6.33 prioritizes our pursuit of kingdom interest. It

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:27.530
says keep on then seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness and all

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:34.729
these other things will be added to you. He said to seek the kingdom first not

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:43.490
second not third or fourth first when we put the kingdom first in our life we do

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.969
not put it off in favor of some trivial pursuit. If it is time for a

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:56.650
Christian meeting we're there. Well before it starts perhaps you have heard

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:04.210
some say at least I made it to the meeting better late than never but the

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:11.129
godly way is better never late. Jehovah is a punctual god he sets the example

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:17.849
for us. When Jehovah decided to destroy the ungodly world in a deluge he said

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:25.849
to Noah Genesis chapter 6 verse 14 make for yourself an art then a Genesis 7

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:32.889
4 Jehovah told Noah to enter into the art and informed him for in just seven

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:40.490
days I will make it rain on the earth for 40 days and 49. What happened? A

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:46.889
better late than never attitude? No. That is not acceptable to Jehovah. Instead

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:54.409
Genesis chapter 7 verse 10 says and seven days later the flood waters came up

00:03:54.409 --> 00:04:02.210
on the earth. Right on time punctuality is a godly quality by means of a prophecy

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:07.930
in Daniel chapter 9 Jehovah indicated hundreds of years in advance when

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.650
Jesus would fulfill his role as Messiah and Savior. When did Jesus present

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:21.930
himself for that role? Better late than never? No precisely on time. In 29 CE

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:29.610
Jesus was anointed as Christ. In fact Romans chapter 5 verse 6 says Christ died

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:37.889
for ungodly men at the appointed time. Jehovah is punctual. What about in

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:43.290
our time? The Bible tells us to keep in expectation of Jehovah's future day of

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:51.649
judgment. When will it happen? Well to us it may seem that it has delayed but

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:59.170
what do we know about Jehovah? He is punctual and so it is that Habakkuk chapter

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:07.250
2 verse 3 tells us for the vision is yet for its appointed time and it is

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:14.129
rushing toward its end and it will not lie even if it should delay. Keep in

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:21.930
expectation of it for it will without fail come true. It will not be late.

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:29.089
Punctuality is Jehovah's way. Unlike the elders cited earlier this Armageddon

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:35.889
will be on time. The Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians chapter 14 was specifically

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:42.529
discussing what happens at Christian gatherings. In verse 26 he said when you

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:49.250
come together let all things take place for building up. Then at 1 Corinthians

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:55.730
chapter 14 verse 40 he concludes by saying but let all things take place

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:01.769
decently and by arrangement. Look at the words again. When speaking about

00:06:01.769 --> 00:06:08.009
Christian meetings he said let things take place decently and Greek it literally

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:14.529
means well-behavidly. Paul also used a Greek word translated here by arrangement.

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:20.970
The literal meaning of the Greek word is according to order. If we are to be

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:27.689
well-behaved according to order at our meeting what would be one aspect of that?

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:34.490
Being punctual on time for the start of the meeting. While the lack of punctuality

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:40.490
affects all cultures to one degree or another it is true that some cultures are

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:46.569
more punctual than others as a whole. A missionary reported that in one town

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:52.649
where he served his wife would be the only person in the audience when he

00:06:52.649 --> 00:06:57.370
announced the opening song at the beginning of the meeting but when he

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:04.170
announced the closing song 70 people would be there. On the other hand in a

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:11.129
Western European country about a thousand people were asked if you were invited

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:18.730
to dinner at 7 p.m. should you arrive five or 10 minutes early or five or 10

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:24.569
minutes late or exactly on time. The majority responded that courtesy

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:31.930
requires scrupulous respect for the host and arriving at the exact minute.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:37.529
Each culture would likely think that the other is extreme. However being in

00:07:37.529 --> 00:07:42.889
punctual is more than a matter of regional preference. It is a godly

00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:48.730
quality that true Christians of every culture want to cultivate.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:55.769
punctuality must become a habit a way of life. It is similar to some countries

00:07:55.769 --> 00:08:02.089
that do not have a habit of good hygiene or cleanliness. That may be true but

00:08:02.089 --> 00:08:08.250
it is expected that Jehovah's people in those lands will excel in good hygiene

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:14.410
and clean habits. In the same way no matter what our background culture

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:20.889
or upbringing it is expected that we as imitators of our God will develop the

00:08:20.889 --> 00:08:27.449
godly habit of being punctual. What helps us to be punctual?

00:08:27.449 --> 00:08:32.889
The Bible encourages advanced planning. Proverbs 21 5 says

00:08:32.889 --> 00:08:39.370
The plans of the diligent surely lead to success but all who are hasty surely

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:45.929
head for poverty. So being punctual is not just a matter of hastily fulfilling an

00:08:45.929 --> 00:08:52.730
obligation or an appointment. It involves thinking in advance about our

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:57.769
responsibilities. Yes, planning to be prepared for them and to be

00:08:57.769 --> 00:09:04.809
prompt in carrying them out. Well, what are some activities that we would want

00:09:04.809 --> 00:09:10.970
to be punctual in fulfilling? It can be the everyday things in life

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:17.289
such as arriving at work or at school on time being punctual for appointments

00:09:17.289 --> 00:09:23.929
such as a visit to the doctor or dentist arriving at the designated time

00:09:23.929 --> 00:09:30.169
when invited to another's home for a meal. What is our habit like when it comes to

00:09:30.169 --> 00:09:36.090
these areas of life? Even more important is punctuality when attending our

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:41.769
Christian meetings and assemblies. This means being present before

00:09:41.769 --> 00:09:48.009
the opening song in prayer. The Apostle Paul quoted from Psalm 22

00:09:48.009 --> 00:09:56.250
when he wrote Hebrews 212 of Jesus. He said, I will declare your name to my brothers

00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:03.210
in the midst of the congregation. I will praise you with song. If that was true of Jesus,

00:10:03.929 --> 00:10:10.330
it is a great incentive for us to participate in singing the first song

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:14.889
with our congregation. And the opening prayer is important for us.

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:23.610
In ancient times, Jehovah called the temple his house of prayer. It's true that the opening

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:31.210
prayer requests Jehovah's guidance and Holy Spirit on the program. However, it also prepares

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:39.769
our minds and hearts to receive the information to be considered. Of course, there may be times when

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:46.169
one is unavoidably late in arriving at a meeting. Public transportation may be delayed,

00:10:46.169 --> 00:10:54.970
or our car may break down. That's understandable on occasion. But what is our habit?

00:10:56.090 --> 00:11:03.129
In the past, it was suggested that we consider arriving 15 or 20 minutes before a meeting started.

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:09.769
One brother with six siblings said his father made a goal of being at the kingdom hall,

00:11:10.409 --> 00:11:17.690
20 minutes before the program began. That certainly took advance planning. His father's

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:27.210
byline for meeting attendance was if you're five minutes early, then you're 15 minutes late.

00:11:28.169 --> 00:11:36.809
In most cases, the whole family arrived 20 minutes before the meeting for wholesome association.

00:11:37.769 --> 00:11:42.889
Another opportunity for punctuality is arriving on time for a meeting for service.

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:50.169
This is challenging for some. However, with a little advance planning, we can be successful.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:57.850
Punctuality is particularly important since the actual meeting is only about 10 minutes long.

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:06.009
If we're late, not only is it disruptive, but it could force the one taking the lead to redo

00:12:06.649 --> 00:12:14.250
the arrangements made for the group. And speaking of our ministry, what is an opportunity to be

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:22.250
punctual every month? Yes, you guessed it. Turning in our Field Service Report at the end of the month.

00:12:23.129 --> 00:12:30.649
Do you have a way of reminding yourself of this? In some lands, it is almost as if it is a custom

00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:36.970
for the start of a wedding talk to be delayed. Often this is because of mistakenly

00:12:37.049 --> 00:12:45.210
gauging how much time the bride needs to get dressed and made up for her grand appearance.

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:53.370
However, being considered if those invited should move those involved to allow extra time

00:12:53.929 --> 00:13:03.049
to complete the task of preparation. A 1990 watchtower commented on being punctual in starting a wedding.

00:13:04.009 --> 00:13:12.649
The very next sentence stated, you may like to have your egg boiled for just so many minutes.

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:21.129
I am not sure exactly how that applies to a wedding, but I think we get to point, don't we?

00:13:21.929 --> 00:13:30.570
We should have calculated the timing in advance so that the ceremony begins on time.

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:36.809
Do we have yet another example of being punctual, not procrastinating?

00:13:36.809 --> 00:13:45.129
How about when there is a difference between you and a fellow believer or a family member?

00:13:45.129 --> 00:13:54.490
Of course, if it is simply a minor issue because of imperfection, often the best thing to do is

00:13:55.049 --> 00:14:05.210
forgive and forget. But if it was more serious or we cannot simply let it go, what should we do?

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:12.090
We need to settle the matter and restore the peace. When should we take this step?

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:19.850
Do not procrastinate if we do the problem may fester and get worse.

00:14:20.809 --> 00:14:26.409
What kind of a priority to Jesus establish for restoring peace between fellow believers?

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:34.409
At Matthew 523-24, note his clear indication of punctuality.

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:41.690
If then you are bringing your gift to the altar and there you remember that your brother has

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:48.809
something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar and go away first make your

00:14:48.809 --> 00:14:55.769
peace with your brother and then come back and offer your gift. Did you pick up on the timing

00:14:55.769 --> 00:15:06.970
that Jesus recommended for reconciliation? He said first, first make your peace with your brother.

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:14.889
It is a high priority and should be treated as such. But remember the scripture we shared earlier,

00:15:14.889 --> 00:15:24.889
Proverbs 21-5. This principle should be implemented. They last part of the verse warns us not to be

00:15:24.889 --> 00:15:34.649
hasty. Hasty is not synonymous with punctuality. Instead the first part of the verse indicates we

00:15:34.649 --> 00:15:44.570
should prepare or plan the visit first. Then follow through without procrastinating. It said this

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:55.210
approach will lead to success. What is the success we are seeking? Jesus did not say to justify

00:15:55.210 --> 00:16:04.649
our position or to point out the flaw in the other person's words or actions. No, he said you

00:16:04.649 --> 00:16:13.370
would be successful if you make your peace with your brother. Punctuality is a godly quality that

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:22.090
we should strive to cultivate. Another aspect of punctuality is ending an assignment on time.

00:16:23.129 --> 00:16:28.009
In the interest of punctuality, let's move on to the next segment of our program.

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:35.450
Thank you brother heard, you who are teaching by example, we appreciate that. And on the subject

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:42.570
of punctuality, we wanted to share an example of how ingrained a problem can become if we let it

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:50.809
fester. Meet brother Peter Zach. As he relates his story, look for ways punctuality or

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:56.490
promptly addressing matters could have helped him to minimize the effects of the problem.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:05.960
I was born in Poland and when I was about five years old, my family immigrated to Canada.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:12.599
I feel from a young age I really loved Jehovah. I had a good relationship with him. I enjoyed

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:20.279
going in field service. I enjoyed the congregation. But like all youths, I had my distractions,

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:27.160
you could say, and for me in particular was video games. I remember in the beginning,

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:32.680
even my parents would set some rules. But as I kept progressing in that game and I started

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:38.279
participating in tournaments, I started getting recognized. Admired, it started becoming a temptation.

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:47.299
People would go to download my previously played games to study my techniques, my strategies.

00:17:47.299 --> 00:17:53.059
I was interviewed by different websites. People wanted to be on my team. I could see that this world

00:17:53.059 --> 00:18:00.980
was slowly dragging me in. For example, there was a huge tournament that I participated in.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:06.500
I finished very well, received many prizes. And then after that tournament, there was another

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:12.099
tournament even bigger, with huge prizes, cash prizes, competition for all the best players in the

00:18:12.099 --> 00:18:17.779
world. At this time, also, the website was growing. We were just sponsored to produce our own

00:18:17.779 --> 00:18:22.500
tournament with cash prizes for the players. So I really thought that this would be an opportunity

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:27.940
for me to maybe have a career, maybe to support myself. So in the future, if I wanted to pie in

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:35.940
here and I thought it was a realistic goal. But as the website also kept progressing and as I got

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:43.619
more involved with it, I realized what I was exposed to was very, very dangerous, very harmful.

00:18:44.579 --> 00:18:52.099
It was immoral, wicked, improper things. I was going to the meetings, I was going in service.

00:18:52.819 --> 00:18:57.619
But at the same time, all my other time was spent on this video game. But it was only slowly

00:18:58.099 --> 00:19:02.660
over time I started realizing that it was having a very negative effect on my spiritual team.

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:09.460
I noticed that when I was in service, I would think only about the video. When the service was over,

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:14.500
I would rush home to play the video game. Even at meetings, I would attend all my meetings,

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:19.539
but I would sit there and nothing was coming in. I went there in person, but my mind wasn't there.

00:19:19.539 --> 00:19:28.099
So that also started bothering me. And at this time, my older brothers who were always a good

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:35.140
example to me, they quit playing games. They were making improvements in the congregation.

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:40.579
They were having privileges, working hard for their brothers and sisters in that congregation.

00:19:40.579 --> 00:19:47.059
I could see they were so happy. They had the real joy and satisfaction. But for me, I didn't.

00:19:49.029 --> 00:19:55.430
I was always feeling empty inside. I need to change. I remember in particular one day at the back

00:19:55.430 --> 00:20:00.710
of the kingdom hall, the brother and elder who studied with me and my two brothers, he approached me

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:10.619
and he very reasonably talked to me about my future. He also helped me see my brothers and how

00:20:10.619 --> 00:20:15.259
they stopped and they were so happy. And I could see the difference. I was serving two masters

00:20:15.259 --> 00:20:27.829
at the same time, but I was really losing out with Jehovah. So I knew I had to make drastic changes

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:33.269
in my life. Up until then, I did try a few times to stop playing video games.

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:39.029
And I worked for a couple of days, but I got right back into it. I lacked self control.

00:20:43.339 --> 00:20:50.380
So I realized that for me, if I wanted to stop this, I need to make complete stop of everything.

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:55.339
So I prayed about it. I asked Jehovah for help, for strength, to give me the courage to take

00:20:55.339 --> 00:21:02.380
this action. We took down the website, deleted the games, stopped playing the games, and just made

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:10.539
a clean sweep, clean stop. And I knew I needed that. Right after, I felt like a load was lifted.

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:20.490
I had all this time now I could spend. And I was spending it more in a ministry, in a congregation.

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:26.170
So soon after, I started auxiliary pioneering, the regular pioneering. I started doing a lot more

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:32.250
in a congregation. I could see how happy I was. It was bringing me real joy, satisfaction.

00:21:33.049 --> 00:21:37.450
So I remember after pioneering for a few years, I started learning a foreign language.

00:21:38.009 --> 00:21:44.650
It was challenging, but it was exciting. I moved to another city to expand my ministry. Then I

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:51.289
moved to another country. And I remember just studying with people as a need grader and just seeing

00:21:51.289 --> 00:21:56.329
them progress and seeing how they made changes in their lives and how they started having

00:21:56.329 --> 00:22:02.170
relationship with Jehovah. And that I was being used to help them to get to that point was such an

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:11.240
amazing feeling. Now I have the privilege of serving in Bethel and I can see Jehovah's hand in my life

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:31.740
and also be able to give every day to him. This is the joy that I was looking for. So I would

00:22:32.539 --> 00:22:39.980
definitely encourage all young ones to really test out Jehovah. Like Ecclesiastes chapter 12 verse 1,

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:45.180
my favorite scripture is growing up, that just give Jehovah, test them out, give them your everything

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:51.339
and you will see you have no regrets. You have true satisfaction from serving him.

00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:00.700
When should Peter have considered limiting his preoccupation with video games?

00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:06.619
Video and computer games in themselves are not wrong unless they are about things Jehovah hates.

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:12.940
But did you notice that Peter explained that there was a point when the games became a temptation?

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:19.740
That is, the games were no longer merely occasional entertainment but started to become the center

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:27.500
of his life. That was the warning for him to sit down and review how much time and effort he

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:32.859
should be spending on video games. But he didn't. He did not address the matter promptly.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:40.140
As a result, he later had to admit that all he thought of even at the meetings or in the ministry

00:23:40.779 --> 00:23:48.140
was video games. Despite the mistake, Peter wisely applied the words of Matthew 5 verse 30.

00:23:49.019 --> 00:23:54.140
Also, if your right hand is making you stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you.

00:23:55.099 --> 00:23:59.420
While he did not need to, literally, cut off his mouse clicking right hand,

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:03.900
he got rid of anything that caused the temptation in the first place.

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:12.859
If you are a parent, you have a responsibility to help your children address any concerns that may arise.

00:24:13.579 --> 00:24:19.819
You need to know what they are doing and then lovingly guide them based on biblical principles.

00:24:20.539 --> 00:24:27.420
Acting promptly when you sense a problem is building up is equally important in other aspects of life.

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:33.019
This dramatization highlights how we can do so when married.

00:24:41.180 --> 00:25:01.099
We do have good friends in our congregation, but there's so much work. Why is Jessica so upset?

00:25:03.859 --> 00:25:07.460
Okay, maybe I should have asked before turning down that dinner invite.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:21.769
But she knows how busy I am. I've got elders meetings, work, pioneering, but she just says,

00:25:21.769 --> 00:25:36.279
we never do anything fun anymore. Maybe she's right. Sometimes even when we're together,

00:25:38.539 --> 00:26:11.400
we're not really together. Lives are filled with spiritual activities, but our family worship

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:28.039
hasn't exactly been regular. Maybe I fooled myself into thinking because we're busy doing

00:26:28.039 --> 00:26:49.660
things for Jehovah, it's okay to skip it sometimes. We argued again tonight, then went to bed angry.

00:26:51.500 --> 00:27:20.009
Something we said we'd never do. The next morning I told Jessica how sorry I was, and she admitted

00:27:20.009 --> 00:27:26.970
she felt bad too. We decided to research Ephesians chapter 4 that night for family worship.

00:27:28.089 --> 00:27:33.769
One article mentioned how sad it would be if marriagemates spoke to each other with less respect

00:27:33.769 --> 00:27:43.369
than total strangers. That really struck us. Then we read Ephesians 4, 31, and 32.

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:50.970
Put away from yourselves every kind of malicious bitterness, anger, wrath, screaming, and abusive

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:58.809
speech, as well as everything injurious. But become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate,

00:27:58.809 --> 00:28:04.329
freely forgiving one another, just as God also by Christ, freely forgave you.

00:28:05.849 --> 00:28:14.309
We both promised to work on making our words and tone more loving and kind. We also studied the

00:28:14.309 --> 00:28:19.750
Bible accounts of Aquila and Priscilla, who are a beautiful example of what it means for a married

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:38.279
couple to be one flesh. They were together at home, at work, and in the ministry. That's when we

00:28:38.359 --> 00:28:53.819
realized we needed to draw closer as a couple. Since then we do as much as we can together.

00:29:03.859 --> 00:29:11.990
We're still busy in spiritual activities, but they are never an excuse to neglect our relationship.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:22.440
And now we aren't just marriagemates. We're once again best friends.

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:32.279
As this dramatization and the example of Peter Zach showed, whenever you sense a problem,

00:29:32.279 --> 00:29:40.359
address it. Do not procrastinate. Be punctual. At times, world events may highlight the importance

00:29:40.359 --> 00:29:47.480
of being punctual. In May of last year, a wildfire overtook the Canadian city of Fort McMurray

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:52.440
in the province of Alberta. The brothers and sisters there benefited from promptly

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:57.079
following the direction they had received from their local congregations.

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:11.859
There was a local needs part and we'd try to do it every year. And this year it was in the

00:30:11.859 --> 00:30:17.380
perfect time because the next week we had the fire. And when the brother was reviewing, he was saying

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:23.779
it was a high fire hazard year. So be prepared and it was nice. The brothers were so obedient and

00:30:23.779 --> 00:30:31.859
took that to heart and we're ready. It happened so quickly from being fine and safe too,

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:37.140
we got to get out of here. We started to hear the municipalities saying there are mandatory

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:42.740
evacuations for different neighborhoods. So within noon, two o'clock, four o'clock,

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:48.339
90,000 people are in motion. When you were standing outside, you could hear the helicopters

00:30:48.339 --> 00:30:53.380
going, the sirens going, the smoke was so thick and intense. Both the lifts and the right

00:30:53.380 --> 00:31:01.059
were all in flames. It was totally in flames. Oh, it was chaotic. People running to their cars

00:31:01.059 --> 00:31:06.500
seeing and looking at the big cloud of smoke approaching them and just the fright in their eyes.

00:31:08.869 --> 00:31:13.269
He just came to mind during the local needs. The brother said, if in case an emergency,

00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:18.549
you have to fall a direction, listen to the local authorities and listen to your local elders.

00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:27.190
Each elder for the field service groups had a care for a small amount of people. I was calling

00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:33.750
all the brothers and sisters that I can find out where they were, if they were safe.

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:38.390
Every group overseer knew exactly where everybody in his group was at all times.

00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:46.549
One brother came to help my wife and the kids to evacuate while I was at work. So I felt very

00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:51.349
indebted to this brother that he acted on my behalf to get my family to a safe place.

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:55.670
To see the brothers okay and calm, it makes me calm.

00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:06.710
It's all gone and it went away overnight. If we are to put our trust in such things,

00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:18.019
where is it now? Although we've lost all this, our relationship with Jehovah, we haven't lost that.

00:32:23.349 --> 00:32:26.950
You can't salvage nothing. Everything is gone.

00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:31.109
Gone, everything is gone. Yeah, this is our basement.

00:32:32.789 --> 00:32:37.349
People always asking us like, did you lose your home and we're like, yeah, we did.

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:44.950
Seeing how quickly things can go, our things can disappear. It helps to appreciate the things that

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:52.230
are most important. Not only did we have our own lives, but we still have our budget sisters

00:32:52.630 --> 00:33:02.900
with us. When we escaped and moved to Edmonton, which is about four and a half hours

00:33:03.539 --> 00:33:08.259
right from here, the friends opened their homes to us and in the middle of the night,

00:33:08.259 --> 00:33:14.420
2.30 a.m. and welcomed us. They gave us food, they gave us clothing, they gave us a place to stay.

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:20.099
That kind of hospitality really touched our heart. We realized that we hadn't missed anything.

00:33:20.579 --> 00:33:36.220
Some of the friends we have been seeing them since the disaster, I'm okay.

00:33:36.859 --> 00:33:41.420
And to meet the friends again, you know, about a month and a half after the disaster,

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:43.900
at the convention was really, really encouraging.

00:33:45.819 --> 00:33:48.619
We see brothers that are working in different departments here at the convention,

00:33:48.619 --> 00:33:53.019
and also with the disaster relief committee who have no home to go back to.

00:33:53.019 --> 00:33:57.259
Yet they're so concerned about someone else that they don't even think about what they've really lost.

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:03.980
Although we've lost everything materially, we have everything spiritually.

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:11.420
What is gone is gone. What is important is our lives and our relationship with Jehovah.

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:36.809
The local needs part proved very helpful for our brothers and sisters in Fort McMurray.

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:43.289
The part included direction about having a go bag and keeping the gas tanks of their vehicles

00:34:43.289 --> 00:34:48.809
full. Because of the distance to the nearest town and the heavy traffic during the evacuation,

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:55.849
having a full tank of gas proved to be very timely advice. Instead of procrastinating,

00:34:55.849 --> 00:35:00.570
our brothers and sisters in Alberta followed the direction to their benefit.

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:08.250
Although our circumstances may not be as extreme, we all experience challenging situations

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:14.170
every now and then. The need to be punctual always applies. For example,

00:35:14.969 --> 00:35:19.929
there is no need to wait for perfect circumstances before expanding our ministry.

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:26.650
For some, expanding our ministry could mean taking the leap into full-time service.

00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:33.130
Two families did just that in this music video entitled Let's Take the Leap.

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:22.900
Not now. This chance might slip this up. It's Let's Take the Leap. Let's not hold. Let's not

00:36:22.900 --> 00:39:39.289
make your whole back. Expanding our ministry in whatever form can bring us great joy at

00:39:39.289 --> 00:39:45.690
servants of Jehovah. Even if your circumstances today do not allow you to enter the full-time service,

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:53.050
there is plenty to do. Our brothers and sisters in Brazil experienced an opportunity to make

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:59.130
special efforts in their preaching work when the Olympic and Paralympic games were held there

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:08.250
in August and September of 2016. Close to 15,000 athletes from approximately 205 countries were

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:23.820
present along with many visitors. More than one million tourists were present at the Olympic

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:28.780
Games in Rio de Janeiro, and among them were around 410,000 foreigners.

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:35.659
In an effort to teach these ones about the Bible, Jehovah's Witnesses engaged in a special

00:40:35.659 --> 00:40:44.699
public witnessing campaign. To reach as many people as possible, we set up 268 cards.

00:40:44.699 --> 00:40:49.099
Not only were the games were held, but also throughout the city of Rio de Janeiro.

00:40:49.099 --> 00:40:53.980
That way were we able to reach people from even far-away islands like Vanuatu,

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:58.139
which is one of the islands of the Pacific. Delegates from that island picked up

00:40:58.139 --> 00:41:12.280
publications from our witnessing cards. We made efforts to put the stands and

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:17.559
cards as close as possible to the places where the brothers would work. Thanks to Jehovah,

00:41:17.559 --> 00:41:21.800
we were able to get a strategic location near the entrance to the arenas,

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:31.269
which we didn't think would be possible. We planned to have 1,500 volunteers, but we got

00:41:31.269 --> 00:41:36.869
4,000 volunteers. We asked for help from other cities, other states, and also from foreign

00:41:36.869 --> 00:41:46.679
language congregations. So for us, this was beyond our expectations. During the Olympics,

00:41:46.679 --> 00:41:50.920
more than one million people passed through the harbor here, and thanks to Jehovah,

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:55.960
we were able to set up more than 40 cards in the immediate harbor area and placed almost

00:41:55.960 --> 00:42:01.480
20,000 pieces of literature. To refill the cards, we used a quadrucicle that picked up the

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:10.420
publications at the support hub and took them to the brothers at the cards. The media provided

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:16.019
extensive coverage with more than 26,000 press professionals involved, and security was also

00:42:16.019 --> 00:42:22.260
reinforced with more than 22,000 military personnel. The work of our brothers certainly did not go

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:31.699
unnoticed. We were at the card when suddenly a police car full of officers stopped in front of us.

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:37.139
I was worried they were going to ask us questions or make us leave, but then they got out of the

00:42:37.139 --> 00:42:42.739
car, came towards us, and one of them picked up the Bible Teach book, and without saying anything

00:42:42.739 --> 00:42:49.539
to us told the others, didn't I tell you I was going to find them here? You can take these publications,

00:42:49.539 --> 00:42:52.980
they're free. These books would teach you amazing things.

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:05.849
This campaign helped to overcome prejudices, both with the authorities and people in general,

00:43:05.849 --> 00:43:08.889
because they were able to see the international scope of our work.

00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:14.170
And this became especially clear when it came to the officials because they allowed the brothers

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:18.489
to put the cards as close as possible to the arenas where the games were being held.

00:43:20.659 --> 00:43:27.059
In all, more than 85,000 publications and more than 10 languages were distributed by means of

00:43:27.059 --> 00:43:33.380
the 268 cards scattered throughout the city. Over a year of planning went into preparing for

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:38.820
this event and produced excellent results. Our international preaching work was

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:44.420
made known to thousands present at the Olympic Games, and most importantly, it gave a great

00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:59.510
shout of praise to our God, Jehovah. We wanted to share a portrayal of life as a witness back

00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:07.190
in the early 1900s. This unique dramatization about the endurance needed as a kingdom proclaimer

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:14.070
was previously shown to delegates at some international conventions held in one city in 2014.

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:19.190
This is a gift video that we received. The title is Knock Knock.

00:44:19.510 --> 00:50:37.079
Are the dead? Would you wish that question answered according to Man's theory or to have the

00:50:37.079 --> 00:50:42.599
answer is pointed out in the Bible? You will say a man's answer would be only a guest.

00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:49.239
And yet for his no truth, more clearly taught in the Bible than that of the resurrection of the dead.

00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:55.960
If the dead are to live again, then they must be resurrected and God has provided that

00:50:55.960 --> 00:51:03.000
our shall be a resurrection. The resurrection of Jesus Christ is a guarantee that all who have died

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:10.230
must be awakened out of death and give it a knowledge of the truth. All mankind were born in sin,

00:51:10.949 --> 00:51:15.269
and the death of the perfect man Jesus provided the purchased price for the right of man to live

00:51:15.269 --> 00:51:23.590
again, and in due time Jesus will awaken them out of death. All of the dead in God's due time

00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:29.750
should be awakened out of death. God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there should be no

00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:35.269
more death, either sorrow or crime, neither shall there be any more pain, or the form of things are

00:51:35.269 --> 00:51:42.869
passed away. The resurrection will bring boundless joy to those who obey God under Christ's kingdom.

00:51:43.829 --> 00:51:48.710
The obedient ones aren't. During the reign of Christ will be given everlasting life,

00:51:48.789 --> 00:51:57.750
on their incomplete happiness and joy. Jehovah's way is always right and true. Learn that way and

00:51:57.750 --> 00:52:09.800
live. The word resurrection means his standing up again to life. If it's claimed with the

00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:15.719
clergy, the dead are alive in purgatory or some other place, then it follows that there could be no

00:52:15.719 --> 00:53:09.820
resurrection, and yet for his no truth. The brother was blessed for his perseverance in the ministry.

00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:17.099
His attitudes showed that he felt the urgency of the message. As God's people, we do not procrastinate.

00:53:17.099 --> 00:53:24.219
Instead, we are prompt. We are punctual. Yes, being punctual is a godly quality.

00:53:25.579 --> 00:53:32.059
We would like to conclude the broadcast with greetings from Uganda, specifically the town of Fort

00:53:32.139 --> 00:53:40.139
Portal in Western Uganda. The 120 publishers there preached to almost 60,000 people who live in Fort

00:53:40.139 --> 00:53:48.619
Portal. They conduct approximately 300 Bible studies. There are two congregations, one English,

00:53:49.579 --> 00:53:57.420
and one rhetoral, and also two rural groups, some 60 kilometers or approximately 37 miles away.

00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:03.340
Brothers are taking turns visiting the two groups and supporting them in the field ministry.

00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:11.340
In the past, the main challenge was the lack of literature and the rhetoral language. However,

00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:17.820
thanks to increased translation efforts, the number of publishers has increased dramatically. As a

00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:25.340
result, the rhetoral congregation was formed in 2014. Next, the remote translation office was

00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:32.219
established in 2015. And as a February of this year, the publishers received the study edition

00:54:32.219 --> 00:54:39.260
of the Watchtower in Routoro. We love our brothers and sisters in Fort Portal very much,

00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:47.579
and they send their love to all of God's people worldwide. This is JW Broadcasting from the World

00:54:47.579 --> 00:54:55.820
