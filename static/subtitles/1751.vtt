00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:07.230
Have you, though, ever felt alone in your assignment, even if, for just a few hours in the

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.230
ministry?

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.589
For the Possean Bucanga may have felt that way early in his assignment.

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:20.510
He was the first circuit overseer for all of what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.230
and the Republic of Congo.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.149
He traveled great distances to visit the few brothers throughout the territory.

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:35.710
Come to what encouraged him the most to keep going.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.990
In 1960, I was made a circuit overseer for the whole of Congo.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:48.909
I was so happy to receive this privilege, but I was shocked and scared.

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:52.390
The assignment was huge.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.829
Congo is a vast country.

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.590
I was afraid to go to places I didn't know.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.769
I felt overwhelmed, so I turned to Jehovah.

00:01:05.769 --> 00:01:10.370
Sometimes I had to go through savannas and across the jungle.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.129
There were wild animals.

00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:17.250
One day I climbed up a tree to find a place to sleep.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.129
I tied myself to a branch with my belt.

00:01:20.129 --> 00:01:25.170
I was afraid I would be taken by a boa snake.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.569
I was afraid of getting lost in the forest.

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:33.290
That in the brothers was very difficult.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.329
Sometimes the journey took many days.

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:44.010
I remember one day I left my house to visit the brothers to encourage them.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:50.769
I left at 5.30 in the morning and I arrived at 7.30 that night.

00:01:50.769 --> 00:01:56.969
I had to push my bicycle through sand for up to 13 miles or even more.

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.609
Other times we traveled by truck.

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:02.209
That was not easy.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.890
We had to climb on top of the truck.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.449
I had to hold on tight so as not to fall.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:16.129
Congregations, isolated groups were far away from one another.

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.930
There were no phones at that time either.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:27.060
Even though they did not know I was coming, they made me feel so welcome.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.539
The brothers were really very hospitable.

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:41.139
When I arrived I was exhausted but so happy to see the brothers.

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:44.780
The kids of Wala was a religion.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:52.490
They sent many letters to the Belgian branch asking to be recognized as Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:59.889
These people used our publications and used the name Watchtower.

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:04.169
It created a lot of confusion.

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:11.219
To clarify the matter, the organization prepared a booklet.

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:19.400
My mission was to check whether there were any genuine Jehovah's Witnesses in Kisangani.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:26.400
We found out that these people were not Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.800
In all the confusion, people even tried to kill me during the trip.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.990
Fortunately, I managed to escape.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:50.069
Once it was Jehovah who assigned me this privilege, I was confident that he would always help me.

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:56.789
And today, I am very happy to have at my side my children, my grandchildren, and my great

00:03:56.789 --> 00:04:02.539
grandchildren, all Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:05.620
Jehovah has given me many blessings.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.300
I am truly grateful.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.219
What a joy to be used by Almighty God.

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:19.069
Through all these years, I have never lacked anything.

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:26.870
Jehovah has given me this strength to serve him up until now, to the age of 86.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:34.110
In everything and for everything, my trust really is in Jehovah.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.069
There were 46 publishers in the whole of Congo.

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:48.089
Today, I hear there are more than 223,000 Jehovah's Witnesses in the Congo.

00:04:48.089 --> 00:05:01.939
Today, when I see the increase of Jehovah's People, to me, it is like a miracle.

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:19.230
I thank Jehovah for allowing me to see the little one become a thousand here in the Congo.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:25.709
Brother Wakonga continues to serve as an elder at nearly 88 years old.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.870
Can you imagine yourself experiencing both the joys and difficulties he had as a circuit

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.230
overseer?

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:39.230
He courageously visited the Kittawala religious groups, who claimed to serve Jehovah,

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:44.230
only to find some were violent and practiced immorality.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:49.709
But it was his reliance on Jehovah, and watching him turn the small group of brothers into

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:53.870
more than 200,000 that has kept him going.
