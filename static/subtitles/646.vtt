00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.099
You have conquered the wicked one.

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:07.099
Who?

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:10.099
A whom was John addressing?

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:17.100
Well, in 1 John chapter 2 verse 14, today's text,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.100
I am writing you young Mehan,

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.100
because you were strong,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.100
and the Word of God remains in you,

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.100
and you have conquered the wicked one.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:38.539
Young men who conquered the wicked one, Satan.

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.539
How did they do it?

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:44.539
Well, they were strong, spiritually strong,

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.539
and the Word of God remained in them.

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:53.890
That is, I had a heartfelt appreciation for Jehovah's Word.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.890
The principles that we're going to discuss this morning

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.890
are good for all of us.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.890
But for a few minutes,

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.890
I thought we could address young men specifically,

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.890
because we have many young men,

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.890
here at Bethel, single and married,

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.890
and we have many young men in the field

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:15.890
and the congregations,

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.890
and all of you are reaching out

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.890
and desirous of serving Jehovah fully.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.890
And we appreciate that.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.890
How is it that you young men

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.890
can be spiritually strong

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.890
and demonstrate your heartfelt appreciation

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.890
for Jehovah's Word?

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.890
Well, I thought we would consider the examples

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.890
of three young men in their late teens,

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.890
to mid-twenties,

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.890
who were mentioned in the Bible,

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.890
Joseph, Daniel, and Timothy,

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.890
and what we can learn from their examples.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.890
So what can we learn from Joseph?

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.890
Turn in your Bible to Psalm 105,

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.890
and we're going to begin reading in verse 17.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.830
He sent ahead of them a man

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.830
who was sold to be a slave, Joseph.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.830
With fadders, they bound his feet.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.830
His neck was put in irons.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.830
Until the time that his Word,

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.830
that is, Jehovah's Word, proved true,

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.830
the saying of Jehovah is what refined him.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.830
So how did the saying of Jehovah refine Joseph?

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.830
We know that as a young man,

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.830
Joseph was gifted by Jehovah

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.830
with dreams that had prophetic significance.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.530
The dreams indicated that Joseph

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.530
would enjoy some wonderful privileges.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.530
But in fact, it would be years

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.530
before Jehovah's promise would be realized.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.530
And in those intervening years,

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.530
as verse 18 indicates,

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.530
Joseph went through some very challenging times.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.530
How did he remain faithful?

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.530
Well, he knew Jehovah.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.530
And rather than drawing away from Jehovah,

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.530
he drew closer to Jehovah

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.530
with full faith that Jehovah

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.530
would keep his promise.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.530
As a result, the experiences refined him.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.530
And when it was Jehovah's time,

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.530
Joseph qualified for some amazing privileges.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.530
Now, what can you young men learn from Joseph's example?

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.530
Don't rush a privilege.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.530
Be patient, willing to wait on Jehovah

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.530
and learn what he's teaching you today.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.530
And if you take that approach,

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.530
you will be loyal to Jehovah

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.530
and just as Jehovah was loyal to Joseph,

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.530
he'll be loyal to you.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.530
What can we learn from Daniel?

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.530
Ezekiel chapter 14 verse 14.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.530
Let's read it.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.529
Ezekiel 14, 14.

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:19.529
Even if these three men,

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:22.529
Noah, Daniel, and Job,

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:24.529
were within it,

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:27.529
they would be able to save only themselves

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:29.529
because of their righteousness

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:33.529
declares the sovereign word Jehovah.

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:37.529
Now, what can you young men learn from these words?

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:40.529
Well, Ezekiel penned these words

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:43.529
about the year 612 BCE.

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:46.529
That means that Noah and Job

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:48.529
had been dead for hundreds of years.

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:50.529
Their record of faith and integrity

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:54.529
was intact and untouchable.

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:57.529
But what about Daniel?

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:59.529
Well, five years before this,

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:02.529
he had been taken to Babylon as a young man,

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:05.529
and it's possible that he was in his late teens

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:08.529
or early twenties at this time.

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:12.529
He was mentioned by Jehovah in the same sentence

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:15.529
as Noah and Job.

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:18.529
What a privilege, but why?

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:21.529
Well, the answer is in the verse, do you see it?

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:25.529
Because of his righteousness.

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:28.529
Daniel at a young age established a reputation

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:31.529
as one who loved righteousness.

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:34.529
He determined in his heart that he would not

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:37.529
break Jehovah's law.

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:41.529
What can you young men imitate Daniel?

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:46.529
By building a reputation as one who loves righteousness.

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:49.529
We're not talking about over righteousness.

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:52.529
That's not a desirable quality.

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:55.529
But a love for righteousness and a determination

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:57.529
to do Jehovah's will.

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:00.529
If you have that kind of a reputation,

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:05.839
Jehovah will notice you just as he noticed Daniel.

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:07.839
What can we learn from Timothy?

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:12.839
One more verse, 1 Corinthians chapter 4, verse 17.

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:18.980
That is why I am sending Timothy to you

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.980
because he is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.980
He will remind you of my methods in connection with Christ Jesus,

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:34.259
just as I am teaching everywhere in every congregation.

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:38.259
Why should these words be encouraging to young men?

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:40.259
Well, do the math.

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:45.259
Timothy was likely in his late teens five years earlier

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:50.259
when Paul invited him to become a missionary.

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:54.259
Timothy accompanied Paul over those five years

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:58.259
and when Paul wrote to the congregation in Corinth,

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:01.259
he entrusted a young man in his mid-twenties

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:04.259
with the weighty responsibility

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:08.259
of assisting a congregation that was facing some serious

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:10.259
spiritual challenges.

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:14.259
Why? Why did Paul trust Timothy?

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:16.259
Because for those years,

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:22.259
Timothy paid attention and followed direction.

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:25.259
And isn't it true, especially here at Bethel,

00:07:25.259 --> 00:07:29.259
we have many opportunities every day to do that, don't we?

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:32.259
To pay attention and follow direction.

00:07:32.259 --> 00:07:34.259
Even in small things,

00:07:34.259 --> 00:07:37.259
it's important to learn to do that.

00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:40.259
And if you learn to do that,

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:45.259
then you'll be entrusted with greater responsibility.

00:07:45.259 --> 00:07:47.259
One more point.

00:07:47.259 --> 00:07:51.259
Does this artwork look familiar to you?

00:07:51.259 --> 00:07:54.509
It's one of my favorites.

00:07:54.509 --> 00:07:59.509
It depicts Paul and Timothy.

00:07:59.509 --> 00:08:02.509
And it nicely portrays the spirit of cooperation

00:08:02.509 --> 00:08:05.509
that existed between those two men

00:08:05.509 --> 00:08:09.509
and the affection they felt for one another.

00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:12.509
On what was their friendship based,

00:08:12.509 --> 00:08:15.509
a mutual love for Jehovah,

00:08:15.509 --> 00:08:19.509
and a determination to do Jehovah's work?

00:08:19.509 --> 00:08:21.509
If you're a brother,

00:08:21.509 --> 00:08:24.509
do you see yourself in that picture?

00:08:24.509 --> 00:08:26.509
All of us should,

00:08:26.509 --> 00:08:29.509
either as the older man or the younger man.

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:31.509
If you're a young man,

00:08:31.509 --> 00:08:33.509
take advantage of opportunities

00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:36.509
to learn from and benefit from the experience

00:08:36.509 --> 00:08:39.509
of spiritual older men.

00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:41.509
I think of the older men

00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:44.509
who helped me along the way.

00:08:44.509 --> 00:08:48.509
And I so appreciate that they did.

00:08:48.509 --> 00:08:51.509
And if you're an older man,

00:08:51.509 --> 00:08:54.509
don't be afraid to share what you know.

00:08:54.509 --> 00:08:57.509
We want our young men

00:08:57.509 --> 00:09:00.509
to advance spiritually.

00:09:00.509 --> 00:09:02.509
So what have we learned?

00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:04.509
Well, don't rush a privilege,

00:09:04.509 --> 00:09:07.509
be patient, wait on Jehovah.

00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:09.509
And like Daniel,

00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:11.509
establish a reputation

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:14.509
for one who loves righteousness.

00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:16.509
And from Timothy,

00:09:16.509 --> 00:09:20.509
pay attention, follow direction.

00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:22.509
In these ways you can demonstrate

00:09:22.509 --> 00:09:24.509
your spiritual strength

00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:27.509
and your heartfelt appreciation

00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:29.509
for Jehovah's work.

00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:31.509
And like those young men

00:09:31.509 --> 00:09:32.509
in the first century,

00:09:32.509 --> 00:09:35.509
you will conquer the wicked one.
