00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:19.260
The willing spirit of Jehovah's people has always made feelings of appreciation well

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.620
up in our Heavenly Father's heart.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:28.179
For example, consider the attitude displayed by the nation of Israel in supporting the construction

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.780
of the Tabernacle in 1512 BCE.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:40.539
As impressive as that structure was, the watchtower of December 15, 2014 stated, what brought

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:47.299
Jehovah the most pleasure was not the material offerings, but the willing spirit of those who

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:50.939
thus supported pure worship.

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:56.859
Exodus 362 describes how Bezelel, a holy app, and other skilled men took the lead in

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:59.179
constructing the Tabernacle.

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:01.780
But many others volunteered.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.299
We are told that everyone whose heart impelled him had a share.

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:12.900
All these people were a special source of joy to Jehovah.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.540
Today, it is impressive to see what Jehovah's organization is accomplishing in all the

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.780
earth, and those who volunteer to do the work at Bezel and in construction assignments

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.019
continue to make Jehovah's heart rejoice.

00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:34.459
The Personnel Committee has prepared the following report to highlight some of the precious

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:41.739
people who work behind the scenes, our hardworking brothers and sisters in construction.

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:46.299
What is their work, lifestyle, and daily routine?

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.700
How can getting involved in this work as a young person lead to rewarding opportunities

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.859
in the future?

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:59.939
And how can all of us support these self-sacrificing servants of Jehovah?

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:06.659
We invite you to watch and listen as some of our dear construction workers tell their stories.

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:14.110
There's something special about construction.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.949
Sometimes you travel to the middle of nowhere, and we've met construction groups, and there's

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:27.150
just a vibe, there's just a weird family, and you're going to have a good time.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.750
So we kind of grew up around construction, which was a huge privilege.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.949
My parents were both involved in construction, on one particular assembly hall.

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:40.550
Yeah, we just heard from a few different characters, and they just seemed to be having so much fun.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:49.939
And the thought of having fun and being in full-time service for Jehovah was very, very appealing.

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:55.099
What I like the most about my assignment is knowing that I can be a useful tool in Jehovah's

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:02.379
hands, and that wherever he sees the need, I can help.

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:07.900
My mom's example later helped me to decide to enter full-time service.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.979
And when it came to doing more for Jehovah, she taught us to make Jehovah service our way

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:16.960
of life.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.400
We really do have a lot of fun on the team.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.879
It's a real mix of characters, ages, experience, and that's really important, because we're

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:34.360
doing a serious work at times, but Jehovah's happy God, and he wants us to enjoy our assignments.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:42.759
I remember one particular convention where I heard a talk about goals.

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:46.360
It kind of made me just take a pause and think about what my goals were.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.159
What do I really want to do in my service to Jehovah?

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:56.560
Have I yet done anything that's really shown him that I'm putting my life squarely in his hands?

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:06.539
And I think that that was that moment in that talk, that I thought it was time for an adventure, was Jehovah.

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:11.539
The routine of a construction servant starts at Bethel with morning worship.

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:13.539
We love morning worship.

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:15.539
It's almost like a mini convention.

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:20.540
You just get that little something to keep you going through the day.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.540
And then we've got a full day from 8 to 5.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.540
I enjoy lunch here on site with the rest of the construction family and some of the Bethel family.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.540
What's really important for all of us on the project is to maintain our own spirituality.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.540
We have an environment where you can do good, quiet study.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.540
In our assignments, it's definitely been when we focused on the Ministry of the Weekends,

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.540
what happens in the week was always better.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:05:00.620
Something else I enjoy about being here in my routine is spending time with my friends.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:11.569
We don't just work, but Jehovah lets us have fun.

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:15.569
So I have no construction background at all.

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:19.569
So everything that I've been able to enjoy with the project has been

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:24.569
because brothers have shown some confidence and given me the opportunity to learn.

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:29.569
There's a huge variety of roles within a construction project of this site.

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:35.569
Obviously there's the needs for the real skills of trades that I needed to actually build the buildings.

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:40.569
But there's a vast support network that can often be off his face.

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:47.139
We're from quite simple backgrounds. We had simple jobs.

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:54.139
And what Jehovah has managed to achieve with us always amazes us, really.

00:05:54.139 --> 00:06:00.139
Because we now do jobs that we never would have imagined that we could have done.

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:10.279
So every assignment that we've had, I think we've felt quite overwhelmed, inexperienced.

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:15.279
I think sometimes when you're completely out of your comfort zone,

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:19.279
is when Jehovah can give you what you most need.

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:23.279
So the end outcome is always an enormous blessings.

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:28.279
And so the blessings always outweigh the challenges.

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:33.279
Something else that's really helped us through challenges is the brothers and sisters we've worked with.

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:38.279
Always there for us, always with a comforting word,

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:41.279
a hug, an arm around the shoulder,

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:48.259
and often that's really helped us get through challenging situations as well.

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:56.259
I think the greatest challenge I faced and continue to face is a fear of the unknown.

00:06:56.259 --> 00:07:00.259
The fear of feeling out an application and sending it.

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:04.259
I'm an assignment that I don't know how to carry out or if I'm capable of.

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:08.259
And of going somewhere else and not knowing how to get there.

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:14.259
Despite the challenges I have faced in Jehovah's service, I have always received help.

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:17.259
And on one occasion, when I was traveling to my new assignment,

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:22.259
I had logistical issues that arose because of the pandemic.

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:28.259
In my case, the branch was always there to support me in everything.

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:35.180
With all the decisions I had to make and the documents I had to get for the trip.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.180
The Bible accounts that's always meant a lot to me is David and Jonathan.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.180
And the fact that they really didn't know each other that long,

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.180
but had such an incredible friendship and bond.

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:51.180
And I really feel the congregation has been that for me out here.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:56.180
And ones that you meet and just within a very short period of time,

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.180
you think they are going to be like family there.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.180
I'm going to know them forever.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:09.180
The project, you could be far away from those that really do know all those years before or your family.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:17.699
So you're so reliant on that support.

00:08:17.699 --> 00:08:24.699
So there is no work we do or assignment we might have that isn't really just giving back to Jehovah,

00:08:24.699 --> 00:08:27.699
a little bit of what he has given us.

00:08:27.699 --> 00:08:32.700
Looking back, the only thing that I regret is not put my application in even sooner.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.700
But there's nothing that I regret about having put it in.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.700
And the life that Jehovah has allowed me to enjoy since then.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.700
Working with a team of brothers and sisters, what a massive privilege.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.700
You're not in the world, you're not in Satan's system.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:53.700
You're just surrounded by characters who have the same goal.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.700
It's not easy living in this system.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.700
I think when we're in full-time service,

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.700
when we're giving ourselves to Jehovah in that way,

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:06.700
he just gives back so much more.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.700
It just becomes a great way to live your life.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.700
You're serving Jehovah, you're with a great group of people,

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.700
and you have in a great time.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.700
And who wouldn't want a piece of that?

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.700
We love our dear brothers and sisters

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.700
who have willingly extended themselves in theocratic service.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:28.700
And we know that you do too.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.700
We thank all of you for the spirit you show

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.700
in helping maintain your local places of pure worship.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:41.700
We commend all of you who, like David, Jasmine, Jonathan, and Carolina,

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:46.700
made the decision as a youth to volunteer for Jehovah's service.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:50.700
We are confident that young ones will set similar goals

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:55.700
and experience the unique joy that working with Jehovah brings.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:01.009
We also want to thank the thousands of special full-time service

00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:04.009
and volunteers who work behind the scenes

00:10:04.009 --> 00:10:07.009
on construction projects around the world.

00:10:07.009 --> 00:10:12.009
Your work is appreciated and worthy of much commendation.

00:10:12.009 --> 00:10:18.419
Your tireless efforts to construct, remodel, and maintain

00:10:18.419 --> 00:10:22.419
places of pure worship benefit all of us.

00:10:22.419 --> 00:10:27.419
Your work contributes to the advancement of kingdom interests,

00:10:27.419 --> 00:10:33.419
and above all, it warms the heart of our Heavenly Father, Jehovah.
