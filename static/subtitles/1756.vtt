00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:11.250
I was born in a little town called Adair, Iowa, actually out on the farm.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.250
That was in 1930.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.250
I was born in 1931, also in a small town in Iowa.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.250
My father wanted to be a farmer, so we moved to a farm.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.250
And I grew up on a farm.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.250
And then the watchtower study of a little group

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.250
and a little congregation was in our home.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.250
And happily, when Peggy's father came to the truth,

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.250
the family, they came to our place to watchtower study.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:49.250
I guess at that time, eight or nine, and Peggy won year younger.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.250
But the thing was, they moved away just about after one year.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.250
Well, I started pioneering in September 1948.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.250
Gilead is at what I want.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.250
I didn't apply for Bethel because I liked the field service

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.250
and I thought South America, Africa, countries that still,

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.250
where there was so much to do, that's what I wanted.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:23.530
I was called to Gilead in 1951 in February.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.530
The assignment after attending Gilead was a great surprise.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.530
Brother Schroeder, one of the instructors, he said,

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.530
you will have a very wonderful opportunity

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.530
being assigned to the German Bethel.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.530
There are brothers there who have been in concentration camps

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.530
for up to nine years.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.530
And you can learn very much from these brothers.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:00.319
And that was very true in 1953 at the convention in New York.

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:06.319
I saw a beautiful young sister standing in the cafeteria line

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:08.319
next to my cafeteria line.

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.319
And I looked twice and it was Peggy.

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.319
So we were together for the rest of the convention

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.319
and decided we would correspond and think about serving together.

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.319
In 1955 we married then.

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.819
I had received the assignment circuit work

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.819
if we were assigned to Northern Germany.

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.819
When we began circuit work I was 24.

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.819
I felt completely inadequate because I'd been serving in Bethel

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.819
and had no training that would qualify me

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.819
to serve as the circuit overseer that was my feeling.

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.819
In the first place the sisters with me they always got nervous

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.819
not being able to speak correctly.

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.819
So they would take over the conversation and I stood there

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.819
and didn't understand anything.

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.819
But with time you pick it up.

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.819
After two years I could understand everything in the

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.819
theocratic language but in the kitchen I was still lost.

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.819
It was nine years for circuit and the conclusion district work

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:25.819
and then we were called back into Bethel.

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.819
The biggest shock for me was when Brother Nora asked me

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:39.819
if I would be branch overseer and that was at the convention 1969

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.819
in Nuremberg despite the different arguments that I presented

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.819
and I got a letter later saying I'd have that assignment.

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:55.819
For about 40 years we had the wonderful privilege of doing

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.819
zone work or as it's now stated being representative of headquarters.

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:06.819
So it was wonderful to visit somewhat over 90 different countries.

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.819
It became acquainted with Jehovah's lovely family

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.819
and the worldwide brotherhood unity and seeing how the brothers

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.819
everywhere are devoted to Jehovah and want to serve him

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:25.819
faithfully under sometimes very difficult conditions.

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:30.819
I would say sometimes we benefited more from the visit

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:37.819
than the brothers we were visiting because it was so faith strengthening.

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:42.819
When we got this privilege of traveling to many branches

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:48.819
and zone work we were able to engage in the field ministry

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:53.819
in numerous countries which I never would have had of course

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:56.819
if I would have just gone into missionary service.

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:01.819
So I said to myself except every assignment Jehovah gives you

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:07.819
and you'll find that you have the greatest blessings possible.

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:13.819
Since 1st of January 1952 I've been able to keep full-time services

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:19.819
my career and it's something I certainly wouldn't have changed for anything else.

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:25.819
We have often spoken where would we be today if we hadn't taken up full-time service.

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:32.819
Certainly we would not have enjoyed so many things as we have in our life deck.

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:37.819
There are so many young talented brothers and sisters

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:43.819
that are working and helping we encourage them to make full-time service

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:47.819
in Jehovah's organization their goal in life.
