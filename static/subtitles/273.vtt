00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:07.669
I thought that only those with an abundance of mature knowledge and experience did special

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:10.189
metropolitan public witnessing.

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:18.510
I thought, I can't do it, I'm too young, still, I decided to send in the application.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.269
I received the invitation and the mail within a month.

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:33.670
I suddenly felt really insecure and afraid, so I prayed to Jehovah, I can't do this yet.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.829
I thought I wouldn't be able to participate in this type of service feeling that way.

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.710
So I prayerfully did research to find some material that would help me.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.469
I found an article about Moses.

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.549
It was an article that stressed that even if we think we aren't able to carry out an assignment

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:54.590
with Jehovah's power, we can.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.909
I also heard a talk that used Jeremiah 20 verse 7.

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:04.870
I was encouraged when it said, even though you might feel you can't do something.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:11.420
If Jehovah gives you the power to do it, then you can do it.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.939
Actually, Jehovah saw my potential and gave me the courage to perform this service.

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:25.439
Even though I thought it was beyond my ability.

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.640
I am being shown time and time again that Jehovah draws people who are sincerely interested

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.000
in the Bible to the cards.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:43.019
I've even experienced helping people make a request for a Bible study using my smartphone.

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:50.340
Really able to grow thanks to this ministry and gain more joy from Jehovah than I ever thought possible.
