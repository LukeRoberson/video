00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:07.450
Welcome to J.W. Broadcasting. Here are some highlights from this month's

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:14.369
program. Sharon Hall couldn't continue as a pioneer, but she still wanted to

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:21.129
expend herself in Jehovah's service. What did she decide to do? And what can we

00:00:21.129 --> 00:00:29.530
learn from her experience? Many schools promote evolution as fact. Is that what

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.609
you're being taught? We'll learn how you can take a stand against this false

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:42.570
idea and prove to yourself that God exists. And we'll debut a new series

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:50.170
designed to sharpen our skills in the ministry. This is J.W. Broadcasting for

00:00:50.170 --> 00:01:17.099
October 2021. Our theme for this month is you are especially acceptable to

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:23.780
Jehovah. We love Jehovah and we want to give him our best, but we want our

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.379
sacrifices to be acceptable to him. So we may strive to be involved as much as

00:01:30.379 --> 00:01:37.260
possible in all the exciting things going on in the organization. But do you ever

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.900
feel discouraged? Perhaps even guilty or frustrated regarding your sacrifice

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:50.260
to Jehovah? In some cases it may be that you're so involved in so many different

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.859
aspects of the work that perhaps you're not giving adequate attention to your

00:01:54.859 --> 00:02:01.579
spiritual, personal or family needs. Or on the other hand, it may be the

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:07.500
opposite situation. You may have those feelings because you cannot do as much as

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.340
you'd like to, or as much as others are doing. For example, you may have been

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.539
very involved in the work, but unexpectedly your circumstances changed because

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:25.620
of your health or some other calamity that came along and shut things down.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:33.219
Such feelings may cause us to ask ourselves, what does Jehovah really expect of

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:39.379
us? Well, we're going to consider three points in our discussion. The first is

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:47.340
we need to set the right priorities. Second, do not compare yourselves unfavorably

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:54.659
with others. And third, remember what's important to Jehovah. Let's start

00:02:54.659 --> 00:03:01.939
with our first point. Jehovah expects us to set the right priorities. But how

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:07.060
can we do that? Well, a scripture that's helped me is found in 2 Corinthians

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.300
chapter 8 and verse 12. Now at the time of this letter, the Christians in

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.939
Judea were facing many trials, and these trials included famine, persecution

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:25.099
and the plundering of their belongings. They needed relief. Now previously in

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:31.340
his first letter, Paul had encouraged the Corinthians to set aside funds to help

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.460
the brothers in Judea. Shortly thereafter, when Paul wrote the second inspired

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:43.099
letter to the Corinthians, he urged them to get their gifts ready. So now with this

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:49.780
context of giving, sacrificing, helping others in mind, let's read 2 Corinthians

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:57.620
chapter 8 and verse 12. For if the readiness is there first, it is especially

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.099
acceptable. According to what a person has, not according to what a person does

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:10.740
not have. Paul here is discussing sacrifices that are acceptable and sacrifices

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:17.259
that are unacceptable to Jehovah. What's the difference? Well, picture it this way.

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:24.379
Picture a young family in Corinth, a father, mother and children. The father

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:28.980
here is the letter from Paul being read to the congregation, and the father's

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:34.939
very excited. He wants to help his brothers in Judea. Now when the family gets

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:40.899
home, he discusses the matter with his wife. He says, we have a little money that

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:46.579
we've set aside to do some work on the house, and we were saving to purchase

00:04:46.579 --> 00:04:52.339
another donkey. However, I'd like to take that money and contribute it for our

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:58.379
needy brothers in Jerusalem. What do you think? Would you say that is an

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:05.699
acceptable sacrifice? Yes, it's a sacrifice. He and his family are donating

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:12.259
money to help others, but it's according to what the family has. That sacrifice

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:17.779
would no doubt be very precious to Jehovah. You can picture how excited the

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:23.540
family would be to support that decision. But now let's imagine a different

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:29.860
family in the same congregation. This time the husband comes home and says, I

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:35.180
know we do not have any extra money, but I'd like to use the money that we've

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.660
set aside to feed our family for the next two weeks and donate it for the

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:47.019
brothers that are in need in Jerusalem. What do you think now? Would you say that

00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:53.699
is an acceptable sacrifice? It's the same good motive, the same good cause. It may

00:05:53.699 --> 00:06:01.779
even be the same amount of money, but is it acceptable? No. Why? It's not

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:06.980
according to what he has. Jehovah does not want him to take food away from his

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:13.139
children. Can you imagine him explaining that decision to his family? The father

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:19.579
has a God-given responsibility to feed his family. Paul says, just give

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:27.300
according to what you have. What's the lesson for us? How can this help us to

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:33.819
maintain balance and set the right priorities? Well, our sacrifices are

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:40.100
acceptable to Jehovah if we give according to what we have, but our sacrifice

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:47.620
would be unacceptable if we try to give beyond what we have. How can we apply

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:54.139
that? Well, there are certain areas that Jehovah says are non-negotiable. What

00:06:54.139 --> 00:07:01.660
are some of those areas? One is our relationship with Jehovah. He expects us to

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.939
keep that relationship strong by making time for such important activities as

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.860
lingering in prayer, reading and meditating on God's word, attending and

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:18.220
participating in our meetings and having a meaningful share in the ministry. So

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:24.220
what we do in the way of work for the organization must never crowd out the

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:29.220
spiritual activities that keep us close to God. You see, that would be

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:37.180
unacceptable to Jehovah. Another example is our family responsibilities. Jehovah

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:43.180
expects us to care for our family, not only materially and physically, but also

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:49.100
spiritually and emotionally. So we must spend time together in family worship in

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:56.259
the field ministry and in recreation. That means that we must not allow our work

00:07:56.259 --> 00:08:02.259
for the organization to interfere with the necessary time we need to care for

00:08:02.259 --> 00:08:10.899
our family. That would be unacceptable to Jehovah. Another example is our health.

00:08:10.899 --> 00:08:16.740
Jehovah expects us to serve him whole soul. That involves doing all our health

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:23.100
allows us to do. So we do all that we can to maintain our health by eating well,

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:29.740
getting enough sleep, exercising regularly. Well, again, we must not allow our

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:35.899
work for the organization to cause us to neglect our health. That would be

00:08:35.899 --> 00:08:43.139
unacceptable to Jehovah. So do you see the point? What can help us to set the

00:08:43.139 --> 00:08:47.740
right priorities? Well, again, remember the principle here in 2 Corinthians

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:54.179
chapter 8 and verse 12, Jehovah in effect says, give to me according to what you

00:08:54.179 --> 00:09:01.179
have, not according to what you do not have. And that will be especially

00:09:01.179 --> 00:09:07.059
acceptable to me. And we know that even though we have set the right priorities,

00:09:07.059 --> 00:09:12.340
it's still a challenge to maintain balance. A balance is not something that

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:17.460
once you have it, you can just lock it in. No, it's like a tight rope walker

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:24.340
who constantly must recalibrate and adjust to maintain balance. The same is true

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:30.100
with maintaining balance in our lives. I know it's a constant process for me and

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:35.899
I'd guess it's just as challenging for you as well. We've had excellent

00:09:35.899 --> 00:09:41.740
articles in our publications that help with managing our time. Here are two of

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:50.539
them. The April 2010 awake page seven has an article entitled 20 Ways to

00:09:50.539 --> 00:09:59.340
Create More Time. And the February 2014 awake page six, how to invest your time

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:05.779
wisely. You may find these helpful to further research on how to set the

00:10:05.779 --> 00:10:13.259
right priorities and maintain balance. A second point to help us maintain

00:10:13.259 --> 00:10:22.059
balance is do not compare yourselves unfavorably with others. There will always be

00:10:22.059 --> 00:10:28.220
ones doing more in their service to Jehovah than we are. And if we start comparing

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:34.500
ourselves to them or feel that they are more acceptable to Jehovah, this could

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:40.980
cause us to lose not just our balance, but our joy as well. When considering

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:46.620
this aspect of not comparing, I think of the prophet's Daniel Ezekiel and

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:52.539
Jeremiah. As you remember, these men wore contemporaries of one another, but

00:10:52.539 --> 00:10:58.620
each had very different circumstances. At Daniel was in the court of the king

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:06.500
in Babylon. Yes, he had times of persecution and challenges, but overall he was

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:12.419
an official for the king. He received special training for his position. So he

00:11:12.419 --> 00:11:20.340
may have had it relatively easy. Ezekiel was living among his fellow exiles in a

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:27.740
community by the river Kebar. Overall, things were fairly stable there. Remember

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.899
the Jews in exile had a measure of freedom. They built houses, they had children,

00:11:31.899 --> 00:11:38.940
they settled down, developed skills in various trades. So it seems perhaps they

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:46.059
had a relatively stable life. Then you have Jeremiah. He was in Jerusalem. It

00:11:46.059 --> 00:11:50.139
seems somebody was always trying to kill him. Much of the time he was either

00:11:50.139 --> 00:11:56.779
hiding or in confinement. So here's the question. Did the differing circumstances

00:11:56.779 --> 00:12:02.539
of their assignments mean that Jehovah loved or favored one more than the

00:12:02.539 --> 00:12:09.539
other? Not at all. It was just an assignment. Jehovah wanted a prophet in

00:12:09.539 --> 00:12:14.980
Jerusalem. He wanted one with the exiles in Babylon and he wanted another in

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:21.059
the court of the king. It was just the way the assignments fell. Now you can

00:12:21.059 --> 00:12:26.460
imagine how a counterproductive it would have been for each of these three men

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:33.179
to judge his value based on his assignment or to compare himself to the other

00:12:33.179 --> 00:12:40.500
too. It could happen. Think about it. Ezekiel and Jeremiah could have looked at

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:46.899
Daniel and thought, he has direct access to the king. He's living where all the

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:51.419
big decisions are being made. He's right in the center of it all. He can use

00:12:51.419 --> 00:12:56.899
his influence to help Jehovah's people. What a privilege that would be. I wish I

00:12:56.899 --> 00:13:05.019
was there. Or Daniel and Jeremiah could have looked at Ezekiel and felt

00:13:05.019 --> 00:13:10.620
that's where they wish they were. We would have at least relative freedom with

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:16.059
the exiles. We'd be able to encourage our fellow worshippers of Jehovah. We

00:13:16.059 --> 00:13:22.659
could help others learn about Jehovah. Or believe it or not Daniel and Ezekiel

00:13:22.659 --> 00:13:28.419
could have looked at Jeremiah and thought we know things are tough but that's

00:13:28.419 --> 00:13:33.500
where we want to be. He's on the front lines risking his life for Jehovah and

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:40.129
the nation. That's where the action is. Different assignments, different

00:13:40.129 --> 00:13:47.889
circumstances, different locations. But they were all special to Jehovah. What's

00:13:47.889 --> 00:13:54.809
the lesson? The lesson is that we must be careful that we do not compare ourselves

00:13:54.809 --> 00:14:01.330
unfavorably with others. It is good to see if we can imitate and benefit from

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:07.009
the example of others. But we need to be careful that we do not begin determining

00:14:07.009 --> 00:14:13.129
the value of what we're doing for Jehovah based on what others are doing. That

00:14:13.129 --> 00:14:19.450
could cause us to lose our joy, lose our balance, and fall into the trap of

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:25.929
doing things for the wrong reasons. That brings us to our last point. Remember

00:14:25.929 --> 00:14:33.250
what is important to Jehovah. Circumstances change in life. As mentioned in

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:38.769
the past, we may have been extremely busy in Jehovah's service. But because of

00:14:38.769 --> 00:14:44.330
the world situation, that may have changed. Or other circumstances in our life

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:52.370
may have changed. Does that somehow change how Jehovah feels about us? No. How do

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:59.210
we know? What is important to Jehovah? What makes you especially acceptable to

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:08.730
Jehovah? Well, let's read together Acts chapter 10 verses 34 and 35. At this, Peter

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:15.809
began to speak, and he said, Now I truly understand that God is not partial. But in

00:15:15.809 --> 00:15:23.129
every nation, the man who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.

00:15:23.129 --> 00:15:30.809
Do it is right, obey his commandments. That's it. That's what makes us

00:15:30.809 --> 00:15:36.970
acceptable to Jehovah. We complicate things at times and equate our

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:43.210
responsibilities, how we're used, where we're asked to serve, as things that define

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:50.210
our value. That's not how Jehovah sees things. A scripture that has helped me is

00:15:50.370 --> 00:16:00.450
found in Ecclesiastes chapter 3 and verse 10. I have seen the occupation that God has given

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:08.769
to the sons of men to keep them occupied. The occupation refers to our activities, the things

00:16:08.769 --> 00:16:16.129
we do. And Jehovah has given us work to keep us occupied. Whenever I read that, I think

00:16:16.129 --> 00:16:20.690
of parents with their children, perhaps they take them to the beach for the afternoon.

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:28.850
And what do they do? They give them some toys and they let them play. Why? To keep them occupied.

00:16:29.809 --> 00:16:35.889
And that in a way is what Jehovah does with us. You think about it. Jehovah does not need us

00:16:35.889 --> 00:16:43.490
to do the work. Jehovah can accomplish his work without us. But he dignifies us and allows us to

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:50.450
have a share. He provides us with meaningful work. Know what it goes on to say in verse 13 of

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:58.610
Ecclesiastes chapter 3. Also that everyone should eat and drink and find enjoyment for all

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:08.210
his hard work. It is the gift of God. Work is a gift from Jehovah. Is it reasonable to think that

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:16.609
Jehovah would give a gift that stresses us out or creates hardship for us? No. He wants us to

00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:22.690
find enjoyment in our work. We are the ones that may get too concerned with assigning rank and

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:29.970
priority to various privileges and locations of service where we are in the sand and what toys

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:39.250
we have to play with. What is important to Jehovah? Notice our final scripture in Ecclesiastes

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:48.059
chapter 12 and verse 13. The conclusion of the matter, everything having been heard is

00:17:48.859 --> 00:17:55.660
fear the true God and keep his commandments for this is the whole obligation of man.

00:17:57.099 --> 00:18:04.619
Fear Jehovah. Keep his commandments. Just serve Jehovah. Do the best that you can.

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:13.500
Stay balanced. Give according to what you have. Those are the important things. And if you do

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:21.660
them, no matter what your personal circumstances, you will remain especially acceptable to Jehovah.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:27.980
Now, let's look at some situations that could challenge us to maintain balance.

00:18:28.859 --> 00:18:34.940
In the following dramatization, notice how the two characters maintain balance.

00:18:54.319 --> 00:19:03.150
It's okay. Take your time. So can you pine your next month? No doubt, you will experience greater joy.

00:19:05.279 --> 00:19:13.039
Brother Choo. Brother Choo, can I have one too? Of course, just a moment please.

00:19:15.039 --> 00:19:20.480
Brother Choo, I have many doctors appointments next month, but maybe.

00:19:21.039 --> 00:19:26.720
Okay. Yeah. I wrote a little something that might help you when you fill it out. Oh, I see.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:33.599
Here you go. Thank you. And remember, our circuit over-serve is in two months.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:39.200
And only 30 hours are required that month. I see. Brother Choo. Yes, hello, brother Lee.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:43.599
Hello, sister Kwan. Hello, brother Lee. Nice job covering those parts at the last minute.

00:19:45.039 --> 00:19:50.400
Anyway, it seems like everyone is away. Hello, sister Kwan.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:55.920
Can I ask you to do something? Here's what I need. Hello, sister Choo.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:02.720
If you want to get something done, give it to a busy man. We can always count on you.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.599
Hannah and I were beginning to feel overwhelmed.

00:20:09.759 --> 00:20:14.559
Brother Choo, may I have a moment? I need your help with something.

00:20:14.559 --> 00:20:22.900
Then Brother Kim needed help with the territories. Of course, we love being busy with theocratic work.

00:20:33.009 --> 00:20:36.130
Yes, Brother Kim? Just a second.

00:20:36.769 --> 00:20:40.130
It's Brother Kim calling about the territories. I'll only take a minute.

00:20:41.089 --> 00:20:47.170
Yes, uh-huh. I see. Yes, I understand.

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:51.250
Okay. Sounds good.

00:20:52.769 --> 00:20:55.650
Other more important things were beginning to suffer.

00:21:00.829 --> 00:21:07.150
It's like doctor's appointments are my whole life now. I have so many next months

00:21:07.789 --> 00:21:13.069
and they take forever to reschedule. How could I possibly make my time?

00:21:15.309 --> 00:21:22.269
There's something written here. Prayerfully consider 2 Corinthians 8 12.

00:21:23.869 --> 00:21:32.420
If the readiness is there, oh, I am ready. According to what a person has,

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.059
not according to what a person does not have.

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:45.630
Jehovah wanted the Israelites to sacrifice their best. But just imagine what happened if they

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:50.430
tried to do more than they could. I can almost hear the reaction.

00:21:52.269 --> 00:21:57.630
Dad, where'd all the sheep go? All of them? What are we supposed to live on?

00:21:59.549 --> 00:22:04.670
No, he didn't want them to sacrifice so much that they couldn't support their families.

00:22:05.789 --> 00:22:12.190
I need those appointments. But maybe in two months when I don't have so many appointments

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:15.390
and the circuit overseer visit, I could set a goal.

00:22:16.509 --> 00:22:22.509
We knew we were taking on too much work, but could we say no? We wanted Jehovah's view.

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:33.440
What's so funny? There's something I just shared with Sister Kwan. That is perfect for us too.

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:42.000
2 Corinthians 8 verse 12. According to what a person has, just like our financial contribution.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:49.119
Exactly. Honey, would Jehovah want us to get into debt to make a huge contribution we couldn't

00:22:49.119 --> 00:22:59.940
afford? You know, that scripture we just read. But they're Kim Seyum. Territories again?

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:07.890
Yes, but I'll tell him that I'll call him after family worship. We can't give what's not ours,

00:23:08.609 --> 00:23:13.809
and we can't let our spiritual routine suffer, even for theocratic privileges.

00:23:14.769 --> 00:23:20.690
No, this promise in the Bible. Look at this flower, isn't it beautiful?

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:28.369
I love this time of year. Thank you both so much for your help this month.

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:34.369
It's so good to find the right balance, and to know we're giving Jehovah all we can.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:44.480
How did our brother and sister feel when they set priorities that were right for them?

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:51.920
They were not downhearted that they couldn't do more. No, they felt good knowing they were giving

00:23:51.920 --> 00:24:01.279
Jehovah all they can give. Now let's consider a different situation. After serving as a regular

00:24:01.279 --> 00:24:08.799
pioneer for many years, Sharon Hall couldn't continue in full-time service, but she still wanted to

00:24:08.799 --> 00:24:18.609
give Jehovah something special. I started pioneering in 1978, straight out of school,

00:24:18.609 --> 00:24:24.769
and then after 17 years, I had to stop because I could no longer meet the R requirement.

00:24:24.769 --> 00:24:31.569
At one of the conventions, I saw some sisters interpreting the program into sign language,

00:24:31.569 --> 00:24:37.329
and so I thought that even if I couldn't continue pioneering, I could do something

00:24:37.329 --> 00:24:42.289
more in Jehovah's service by learning sign language, and so I started to do that.

00:24:42.289 --> 00:24:48.690
Because I was deeply grateful to Jehovah for all you done for me, I resumed pioneering again

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:57.809
in September 2009, and then I had the added blessing of now pioneering in sign language field.

00:24:57.809 --> 00:25:07.089
One day I met Cecilia. She suffers from a genetic syndrome called Asher's, which causes

00:25:07.089 --> 00:25:16.609
deafness coupled with tunnel vision that can over time lead to blindness. Because of that disability,

00:25:16.609 --> 00:25:24.529
it made her extremely shy, so it was very difficult to communicate with her. I started studying

00:25:24.529 --> 00:25:32.529
with her in October 2009, and very quickly she started attending meetings. I would fetch her

00:25:32.529 --> 00:25:37.569
for the meetings, and then drop her off at home afterwards. I lived about five minutes

00:25:37.569 --> 00:25:45.490
from the Kingdom Wall, but she was 30 minutes away, and quickly I realised that she would also need

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:53.170
to put in effort to get to the meetings in order to make progress. Cecilia lived close to where she

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:59.970
could catch a taxi up to the train line, and then it would be two train journeys to get to the

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:07.809
Kingdom Wall. So it would take her each way an hour and a half to two hours. She also lived in a

00:26:07.809 --> 00:26:18.450
notoriously unsafe area because of gang violence, but I knew that Cecilia was strong willed enough,

00:26:18.529 --> 00:26:26.049
and independent enough, in spite of her, to medity and reticence, to be able to get herself to

00:26:26.049 --> 00:26:33.250
the meetings. Cecilia was attending meetings regularly, but instead of a skirt, she wore pants to

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:41.490
the meeting. So I chatted to Nancy, as the stoker at the time was accompanying me to her study

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:47.329
most weeks, so that we could try and figure out a way of helping her to make the change she needed to

00:26:48.289 --> 00:26:55.490
It took about a year of gently showing pictures, reviewing the Bible principles,

00:26:55.490 --> 00:27:00.210
but eventually she did get the point. One of the weekends that she was staying over,

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:09.089
I went into her room and on her bed neatly laid out. It was a skirt on top, ready for the meeting.

00:27:09.089 --> 00:27:15.250
I thanked her over at that point because finally our patience had been rewarded.

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:22.130
We had all of our meetings on a Saturday with a lunch break in between when we would associate,

00:27:23.089 --> 00:27:30.690
but we noticed that Cecilia was isolating herself. To reinforce for Cecilia, the principle of act

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:38.049
20 verse 35, a friend came up with the good idea of helping her to bake cookies the day before

00:27:38.049 --> 00:27:44.930
the meeting. Cecilia shyly offered the cookies to each person there during the lunch break,

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:50.529
and it elicited such a warm response from the brothers and sisters and friends there.

00:27:50.529 --> 00:27:56.930
It really drove home the point for Cecilia, and it was beautiful to see her after that come

00:27:56.930 --> 00:28:07.089
out of her shell. In July 2014, Cecilia gave her first student talk, and in that month she also

00:28:07.089 --> 00:28:13.650
started publishing. There have been challenges, particularly learning sign language,

00:28:14.609 --> 00:28:21.490
but even more so, getting to understand the deaf culture, the way that they think,

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:31.730
also financial hardships, but the challenges and the sacrifices were far outweighed by the blessings.

00:28:32.289 --> 00:28:38.609
A day that's etched in my memory is the day that she told me she wanted to get baptized.

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:46.849
Cecilia has really become like a daughter to me, and I'm so proud of the enormous strides that

00:28:46.849 --> 00:28:54.849
she made in the truth. In October 2015, she was baptized. I cried with joy that day.

00:28:55.569 --> 00:29:02.930
I've been pioneering now for 28 years, and over that time, particularly since I started again,

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:09.329
and with Cecilia, many, many, many brothers and sisters in the congregation helped me,

00:29:09.329 --> 00:29:17.089
they accompanied me to a study. They became friends with her, they took over when I went away,

00:29:17.089 --> 00:29:23.970
I could never have done it on my own. Above all, Jehovah has helped me to cultivate

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:33.569
qualities like patience, self-control, humility, compassion. It was really wonderful to play a small

00:29:33.569 --> 00:29:46.779
part, such a privilege, to help Cecilia to become part of Jehovah's family. Sharon's decision

00:29:46.779 --> 00:29:54.380
required sacrifice, but it led to wonderful blessings for her and for Cecilia.

00:29:54.940 --> 00:30:03.500
We hope that young witnesses have been enjoying our series My Teen Life. It features real issues

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:11.099
that you face today. Our next episode deals with one of life's most important questions.

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:19.819
Why believe in God? Have you ever asked yourself that? Even though you've been reading the Bible

00:30:19.819 --> 00:30:27.019
and attending meetings for years, listen to your peers explain how they convinced themselves

00:30:27.819 --> 00:30:40.799
that God does exist. So I'm sitting in a business class, and all of a sudden,

00:30:41.519 --> 00:30:46.960
the subject of evolution comes up. When my teacher asked me why, to give the reason why I don't believe

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:51.839
in evolution, I remember all I could say was, it's just because I'm one of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:30:51.839 --> 00:30:58.559
and that's my belief. Many students actually believe, like they seem so sure that evolution

00:30:58.559 --> 00:31:05.599
is a fact. My hands getting, or like my palms getting sweaty, and just nervous.

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:12.480
I felt intimidated. I just sat there. I felt paralyzed, and I couldn't defend the truth.

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:18.480
Why can't I explain this? I could explain why I don't suit the flag so easily. Why I don't

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:23.519
celebrate birthday so easily, I didn't understand why I couldn't explain this. Specific topic.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:33.920
I had doubts, and I was asking myself questions like, does God really exist? Is the Bible accurate?

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:40.319
So that day after I came home from school, I went to my mom, and I asked her, you know, this is what

00:31:40.319 --> 00:31:48.319
happened at school, and I need answers. I feel like I don't know what to do, especially since my

00:31:48.319 --> 00:31:55.039
parents were not serving Jehovah. So I had to pray to Jehovah to help me.

00:31:56.079 --> 00:32:01.839
So she sat me down at the computer. We went to JW.org, and then in the search box,

00:32:01.839 --> 00:32:07.119
my mom told me to type in anything that was the problem, what I had questions on. So we typed

00:32:07.119 --> 00:32:13.759
in evolution. That's when I clicked on the origin of life brochure. It just started like coming in,

00:32:13.759 --> 00:32:19.200
like everything started clicking as if like, you know, there's a light bulb that went off.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:23.680
So in one of the videos and the viewpoints on this origin of life section,

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:32.480
it talked about the brain and how the brain is so complex that billions and billions of neurons

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:39.759
are connected to one another. It amazed me so much that how because of the brain we can move our

00:32:39.759 --> 00:32:46.079
hands, we can move our feet, we can do facial expressions, we can do so many things because of

00:32:46.079 --> 00:32:52.400
this great part of the brain. It was, you know, the exact questions that I was having trouble

00:32:53.519 --> 00:32:58.559
understanding, and each question I'm like, I was like, oh, I remember reading this in, you know,

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:04.799
one of the watchtowers with the books I was studying, but it broke it down into ways that, you know,

00:33:05.519 --> 00:33:10.720
words that are simple for me to understand at that point. So it was almost, you know, it felt like

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:16.559
Jehovah was talking to me through this brochure, and it just, it felt I was like, this is what I need to

00:33:16.559 --> 00:33:23.200
read, and that's what helped me get through it. So I thought to myself, this couldn't have been

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:31.359
made just by chance. It couldn't just exist by an accident. It had to be created. It had to be

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:38.640
designed. So I was able to go back and I went to my science class and I told my teacher, I was like,

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:45.519
I'm ready to explain why. So here we go again. It's physics class. It's the same topic all over

00:33:45.519 --> 00:33:52.640
again, but this time it was different. I was able to defend my faith in Jehovah. I realized that,

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:58.400
you know, Jehovah always provides the answers to any topic, anything, I just have to be willing to

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:04.319
go and find it. Whenever I have questions about anything, I look for the answers, but first I

00:34:04.319 --> 00:34:11.920
pray that Jehovah, and Jehovah has made it so easy for us to find the truth. I'm totally convinced

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:37.139
that whatever he says in the Bible, we can completely trust in it. As we saw, it's important that

00:34:37.219 --> 00:34:46.579
you teams do more than disprove evolution. The underlying issue is whether you personally believe

00:34:46.579 --> 00:34:56.420
in God. Use your power of reason to prove to yourself that he does exist. We're very excited to

00:34:56.420 --> 00:35:03.940
share with you a new series. Many of us enjoy the visit of our circuit overseer, especially the way

00:35:04.099 --> 00:35:11.539
he takes the lead in the ministry. Often the circuit overseer helps us to apply suggestions from the

00:35:11.539 --> 00:35:19.940
faithful slave on how to better carry out our ministry. This new series features experienced

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:27.219
circuit overseers doing just that, helping us sharpen our skills in the disciple making work.

00:35:28.179 --> 00:35:36.260
The series is called Iron Sharpen's Iron. In our first episode, Taylor Bourne-Shine shares

00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:46.260
suggestions on how to effectively start conversations. Hi, I'm Taylor and this is Iron Sharpen's Iron.

00:35:54.909 --> 00:35:59.550
Today we're going to practice how to start a conversation that could lead to a witness.

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:08.269
For many, this can be terrifying. Why? Well, as soon as we see someone that we'd like to talk to,

00:36:08.269 --> 00:36:13.710
we can start to think to ourselves, what am I going to say? How am I going to give a witness or

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:20.670
how are they going to react? We can become so overwhelmed with anxiety or nerves, thinking about how

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:26.989
the conversation will end that we never even start. Here's something that we must keep in mind.

00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:37.070
Our goal is simply to start a conversation. So if we've started a conversation, we've succeeded.

00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:42.909
We've reached our goal. Then we can just relax and see if it leads to a witness.

00:36:44.349 --> 00:36:52.909
The September 2018 Life and Ministry Meeting Workbook shows us how we can start a conversation

00:36:52.909 --> 00:36:59.869
like Jesus did with the Samaritan woman in John chapter 4. So when we see someone that we would

00:36:59.869 --> 00:37:09.309
like to talk to, we want to keep these three steps in mind. Number one, be friendly. That's it.

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:16.429
Just be friendly. Now we can be nervous so we can say quick prayer to Jehovah to give us courage,

00:37:16.429 --> 00:37:21.630
but then we can give a friendly greeting. Then we can mention something that's happening

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:26.030
right then and there. Maybe the weather, the long line at the grocery store,

00:37:26.829 --> 00:37:34.269
their nice car, or another genuine compliment. Jesus, when he started his conversation in verse 7 with

00:37:34.269 --> 00:37:41.869
the Samaritan woman, he simply said, and no doubt in a friendly way, give me a drink. Step two,

00:37:42.909 --> 00:37:50.670
let the conversation progress naturally. Don't rush it. If the conversation ends before we're

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:55.949
able to give a witness, it's okay. We accomplished our goal. We started a conversation.

00:37:56.590 --> 00:38:02.590
Now we're ready to try again. Now if the conversation continues on, then we can look for an

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:12.590
opportunity to take step three. Make a simple expression of our faith. Seven verses after Jesus

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:18.269
started the conversation with the Samaritan woman, then he witnessed her. He said he had water

00:38:18.269 --> 00:38:25.230
that imparts everlasting life. But between those two points, he didn't lecture her. He let her

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:31.789
talk and express herself and he listened to what she had the same. So with those three steps in

00:38:31.789 --> 00:38:39.070
mind, now it's our turn. It's our turn to practice starting a conversation that could lead to a

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:46.349
witness. Now tie it in with us. We have Tais and Carolina who have joined us for a demonstration.

00:38:46.909 --> 00:38:49.869
So where are you going to try to start your conversation today?

00:38:50.429 --> 00:38:54.590
We are in a department store. Yes, we are in a Portuguese congregation and it's

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:59.389
common to hear people speak Portuguese when they're all shopping. Excellent. So you've heard the

00:38:59.389 --> 00:39:05.150
three steps that we want to try. But first, let's see what could happen if we rushed the conversation.

00:39:05.789 --> 00:39:10.510
Okay. Wait a little bit. I heard you speaking Portuguese. Where are you from?

00:39:10.989 --> 00:39:16.989
Oi, I'm from Rio de Janeiro. I'm from São Paulo. How long have you been here? Just three months.

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:23.630
It's so hard to just, isn't it? You know, the Bible helps me so much when I moved here. I don't

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:27.789
want to keep you from your shopping, but you can read the Bible in Portuguese on our website.

00:39:27.789 --> 00:39:34.030
And it has articles I know you'll find comforting. Okay, so time out. Now Tais, we know you rushed

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:39.789
that on purpose. But how did it make you feel when you did? Yeah, it didn't feel right to start

00:39:39.789 --> 00:39:44.829
when it's so quickly. And I thought she wasn't expecting it. Right. And Carolina, how about

00:39:44.829 --> 00:39:49.630
you? How did it make you feel? It started okay, but then got awkward real fast.

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:55.789
Right. So now maybe you can show us what it's like when the conversation will progress more

00:39:55.789 --> 00:40:03.230
naturally. Okay. Oi, tudo bem? I heard you speaking Portuguese. Where are you from? Oi, I'm from

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:10.670
Rio de Janeiro. Oh, nice. I'm from São Paulo. I recognize your accent. I'm Tais. I'm Carolina.

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:15.389
Nice to meet you. Wow, how long have you been here? Only three months.

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:24.110
Well, for me, it's been three years and the first was the hardest. Yes, we finally have work,

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:29.150
but we are still looking for a place to live. And immigration has been harder than we thought.

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:37.230
Wow, I'm so sorry. Do you have family with you? My husband. We had to live our son with my mother.

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:44.670
I miss him so much. Wow, that's so hard. But we have to keep trusting in God. In my case,

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:49.710
is what got me through. I know. But I still worry when I don't know what he'll do for us.

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:56.829
Okay, so let's stop there. Really nice. Thank you. So Tais, where do you feel the conversation is at

00:40:56.829 --> 00:41:02.349
at this point? Yeah, I feel like I found a good time to say something about my faith. And now

00:41:02.349 --> 00:41:10.110
she's seeing how she feels. Nice, excellent. And Carolina, how about you? It was just a nice conversation.

00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:15.949
So when she mentioned God was not awkward. Thank you sisters for letting us learn from your conversation.

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:24.349
I found that helpful. And I hope you did too. Make it your goal to start conversations with those

00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:31.949
three steps. Be friendly. Converse naturally and find the right time to express your faith.

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:38.829
Practice at home or with a friend and see for yourself how iron sharpens iron.

00:41:41.179 --> 00:41:48.940
That was a great demonstration. Future episodes of iron sharpens iron will show us more ways

00:41:49.019 --> 00:41:58.380
to enhance our skills as ministers. Each of us wants to be a source of comfort and encouragement to

00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:05.019
our brothers. That was the subject of a recent morning worship by brother William Turner.

00:42:08.219 --> 00:42:13.820
Well, I think we'd agree that it's very hard warming to know that we serve a God of comfort.

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:20.699
And he provides us with so many reminders that highlight the need for us to encourage, strengthen,

00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:27.340
and comfort one another, especially now and the times in which we live. Because none of us know the

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:34.059
full weight of what our brothers here in the Bethel family and our congregations might be facing or

00:42:34.059 --> 00:42:41.980
dealing with. So having and showing empathy, fellow feeling towards one another is so important.

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:50.699
Perhaps a good example of how not to show comfort and fellow feeling is described for us by

00:42:50.699 --> 00:42:57.980
Job's three comforters. You might recall they were so busy judging him and giving Job speeches

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:04.940
that they failed to take the time to understand him and to show fellow feeling. In fact, in all the

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:13.179
talking they did, not once do we read that they even addressed Job by name. The watchtower made

00:43:13.179 --> 00:43:20.460
a statement regarding these comforters. It said, evidently, they view Job more as a problem

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:26.300
than as a person. Now, how do you think that treatment made Job feel?

00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:38.960
Turn with me in your Bibles to Job chapter 19. And we'll listen to Job's words, Job chapter 19 verse 2.

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:54.860
He says, How long will you keep irritating my soul, crushing me with words? How sad? Instead of

00:43:54.860 --> 00:44:05.099
providing encouragement and comfort, those companions only made Job feel irritated, crushed and frustrated.

00:44:06.699 --> 00:44:11.420
What doesn't this highlight that if we don't give thoughts to our words and actions,

00:44:12.219 --> 00:44:19.099
if we view our brother more as a problem than as a person, then we're not going to be able to

00:44:19.099 --> 00:44:26.219
provide them with the comfort and support they may need. Perhaps we might work with or

00:44:26.219 --> 00:44:32.460
we're in the congregation with someone that has faults or traits that bother us. And it may be

00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:39.820
that these faults are actually legitimate causes of concern. But in our dealings with them,

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:45.980
if those faults are the only thing that we can see, if that's the only thing we focus on,

00:44:46.619 --> 00:44:52.539
then it's going to be very difficult for us to see them as a faithful fellow worker of Jehovah.

00:44:53.739 --> 00:44:59.579
More than likely all we're going to see is someone who is an obstacle or impediment to our work,

00:45:00.539 --> 00:45:08.059
someone that is affecting or impacting our production and joy. And certainly we're not going

00:45:08.059 --> 00:45:13.579
to feel good because now we've developed negative feelings about our brother and our brother is

00:45:13.579 --> 00:45:20.460
likely going to feel the spirit that we give off. And how's that going to affect them? Well,

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:26.780
like Jehovah, likely they're going to be frustrated, irritated, and we've only added to their

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:33.659
anxiety. Well, obviously none of us want to have that sort of effect on our brothers. And that's

00:45:33.659 --> 00:45:42.139
why halls words to the Thessalonians are a good example worthy of imitation. When we look at this

00:45:42.139 --> 00:45:48.139
congregation practically from the beginning, the congregation that was established in Thessalonica,

00:45:48.139 --> 00:45:54.219
those brothers and sisters experienced persecution. In Acts chapter 17, it mentions that

00:45:54.219 --> 00:45:58.940
fanatical Jews stirred up mom violence, prompting the brothers to send Paul and Silas away

00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:05.179
for their personal safety. Another issue that was affecting the congregation was that they seemingly

00:46:05.179 --> 00:46:12.699
expressed great sorrow over losing ones of their number and death. So now you think about that.

00:46:12.699 --> 00:46:17.420
You have the full picture here. You have a brand new congregation and they're feeling the heat and

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:25.900
pressure of intense persecution from the outside. And then on the inside, they're feeling the pain

00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:34.860
of losing loved ones in death. Does that congregation in need of comfort and encouragement? Without

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:42.139
question. But interestingly, in the midst of all of this persecution and sadness, it was also

00:46:42.139 --> 00:46:46.940
discovered that those Christians were dealing and struggling with some personal weaknesses.

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:53.500
When you look at 1 Thessalonians chapter 4, there they were counseled to abstain from fornication,

00:46:54.219 --> 00:46:58.699
to love one another and fuller measure, to mine their own business, to work with their hands,

00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:05.500
then chapter 5, to stay awake spiritually and to abstain from every form of wickedness

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:13.340
and a number of other matters that needed attention. Now, each of those matters were all legitimate

00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:20.539
causes of concern. In fact, Paul felt this was so urgent that he sent them a second letter,

00:47:20.539 --> 00:47:28.539
which closely followed his first. But what was Paul going to focus on? Would he focus

00:47:28.699 --> 00:47:35.739
on the problem or the people? Turn with me please to 2 Thessalonians chapter 1. Let's

00:47:35.739 --> 00:47:45.219
note how Paul begins this chapter, 2 Thessalonians chapter 1. And we'll read his words beginning

00:47:45.219 --> 00:47:55.500
in verse 3. He says, we are obligated always to give thanks to God for you brothers. This is fitting

00:47:56.380 --> 00:48:02.300
because your faith is growing exceedingly and the love of each and every one of you was increasing

00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:09.099
toward one another. As a result, we ourselves take pride in you among the congregations of God,

00:48:09.099 --> 00:48:15.019
because of your endurance and faith and all your persecutions and the hardships you are suffering.

00:48:16.539 --> 00:48:22.300
How beautiful. Did you know Paul starts with specific commendation? Yes, there were problems

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:28.460
that needed to be addressed, but he starts with their good qualities, what they were doing right.

00:48:29.099 --> 00:48:36.380
Can you and I do the same in our dealings with our brothers? Is that a first thinking what they're

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:43.340
doing wrong? What do they do right? What do we appreciate about them? Isn't it so much better to

00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:51.420
focus on their good traits? The benefits of doing this is that it helps us to develop genuine

00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:57.739
personal interest in our brothers, because if our brothers can sense that we truly care about them,

00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:03.579
then it actually puts us in a better position to assist them with any matters that may need

00:49:03.579 --> 00:49:09.099
adjustment. And what we'll find is that this personal interest can start with something as simple

00:49:09.739 --> 00:49:15.980
as acknowledgement. You recall, Job's false comfortors didn't even address Job by name,

00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:22.860
but the young man Elihu, when he was given the opportunity to speak, when addressing Job,

00:49:23.579 --> 00:49:29.099
he respectfully addressed him by name. Job, chapter 33, verse 1,

00:49:29.739 --> 00:49:37.659
Elihu begins his words by saying, Job, please, hear my words. And there were many other

00:49:37.659 --> 00:49:44.780
verses where he used Job's personal name as well. I think we'd agree sometimes it can be so easy,

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:51.340
especially for us as brothers, to get into work mode, business mode, where we're just so focused

00:49:51.739 --> 00:49:57.579
getting information, whether it's here at Bethel or in the congregation, we could completely forget

00:49:57.579 --> 00:50:05.019
to acknowledge or even greet the brother in front of us. So what a beautiful reminder we learned

00:50:05.019 --> 00:50:13.820
from Elihu. Now, we go back to Paul after his commendation in 2 Thessalonians, chapter 1. He

00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:21.019
starts chapter 2 of 2 Thessalonians with the word, however. So now they're the contrast, they're

00:50:21.019 --> 00:50:26.380
the shift in wording, and he begins to address the problem some had developed regarding a wrong

00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:32.539
view of Christ's presence. So we learned from this that Paul did not sugarcoat or overlook

00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:40.780
issues that needed to be addressed. He handled them, but he did it in such a way where the brothers

00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:49.340
were still able to feel his loving care and concern. In fact, if you look in verse 13, you'll

00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:56.699
notice he uses the word, however, again, so another shift. But this time, shifting back to words

00:50:56.699 --> 00:51:04.860
of empathy, love, and exhortation for his brothers. Paul was convinced he had a positive conviction

00:51:05.739 --> 00:51:13.340
that his brothers would do the right thing. So in review, if we want to be a source of comfort and

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:20.780
encouragement to our brothers, how important it is that we see them not as a problem, not as an

00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:28.780
impediment to our work, but as our fellow worker. And instead of judging, we commend, showing

00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:34.619
genuine personal interest and acknowledgement. And if there is a legitimate issue of concern,

00:51:35.739 --> 00:51:41.579
well, we can lovingly address what needs to be addressed, but always be remembered more for our

00:51:41.579 --> 00:51:48.539
encouragement than our counsel. And if we're able to do this, then our brothers are going to love

00:51:48.539 --> 00:51:54.539
us for the way that we deal with them. But more importantly, our Heavenly Father, our God of

00:51:54.539 --> 00:52:03.420
comfort, he will love us as well. In our program, we've discussed the value of setting the right

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:10.699
priorities. This is particularly important during our youth. When we're encouraged to give our best

00:52:10.699 --> 00:52:19.659
years to Jehovah. As our new song reminds us, we will never regret making that a priority.

00:52:44.219 --> 00:52:51.500
This world, trying to mold you, suddenly it was not so easy to be knocking on those doors,

00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:59.179
but as you get solar smarter, trying to work harder, never let go of Jehovah.

00:52:59.179 --> 00:53:09.730
The best is still in store. You have the treasure that plays in Jehovah's House.

00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:19.010
He'll help you out. And you have so much to offer, so much to do.

00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:40.510
Jehovah sees your faith knowing, treasures you, changes like all the trials have just begun.

00:53:41.309 --> 00:53:50.510
Growing anxious from all of your fears, talk to God. He always listens.

00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:57.469
And as you get wiser, find the ways you can apply the truth in your life.

00:53:57.469 --> 00:54:08.510
Feel the joy of sacrifice and as you get taller, smarter, trying to work harder, never let go of Jehovah.

00:54:08.590 --> 00:54:11.630
The best is still in store.

00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:18.699
Treasure that plays in Jehovah's House.

00:54:18.699 --> 00:56:04.510
Who did it?

00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:09.389
In this month's program, we learn the value of maintaining balance.

00:56:10.349 --> 00:56:15.710
We cannot let our spiritual routine suffer, even for theocratic privileges.

00:56:16.989 --> 00:56:23.710
Sharon Hall made sacrifices to do more for Jehovah. And she received many blessings.

00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:32.269
We saw how teens use their power of reason to prove to themselves that God exists.

00:56:33.550 --> 00:56:41.949
And the first episode of our new series, Iron Sharpens Iron, showed how we can start conversations

00:56:41.949 --> 00:56:46.030
by being alert for opportunities and by being friendly and kind.

00:56:47.389 --> 00:56:49.869
Now it's time for our video postcard.

00:56:50.829 --> 00:56:54.110
Let's visit our brothers and sisters in Madagascar.

00:56:55.550 --> 00:57:02.030
Lying off the east coast of Africa, Madagascar is the fourth largest island in the world.

00:57:03.070 --> 00:57:11.469
It's climate and diverse terrain. Make it a sanctuary for an amazing variety of plants and animals.

00:57:11.869 --> 00:57:19.710
The Beobab tree is known for its barrel-shaped trunk and extraordinary longevity.

00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:24.510
There are nine species of Beobab in the world.

00:57:24.510 --> 00:57:28.429
Six can be found only in Madagascar.

00:57:28.429 --> 00:57:33.150
About 40 different species of lemur live here.

00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:36.670
Among them, the ring-tailed lemur.

00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:41.150
And this one is called Kokaru's Sifaka.

00:57:42.349 --> 00:57:44.909
Rice fields dot many parts of the country.

00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:48.989
Rice is the staple food of the Malagasy people.

00:57:51.070 --> 00:57:58.110
In Sieta Bay is Madagascar's third largest city and home to 34 congregations.

00:57:59.070 --> 00:58:05.389
Since few in Madagascar have running water, many people can be contacted while they do their

00:58:05.389 --> 00:58:13.789
laundry in rivers and lakes. Let's visit Tanembao Sifuni, a remote community on the southeastern

00:58:13.789 --> 00:58:22.349
coasts. Our brothers share the good news despite frequent rain showers and the great distances they

00:58:22.349 --> 00:58:30.190
have to walk between villages. Response to the Kingdom message is strong and many ask for a

00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:37.550
Bible study. Here two sisters are conducting a study while others wait their turn.

00:58:38.909 --> 00:58:45.789
Interested ones walk up to 16 kilometers or about 10 miles every week to attend meetings.

00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:54.909
The village has no electricity. So to download big video files such as convention videos,

00:58:55.869 --> 00:59:02.510
this elder and other brothers travel 12 hours, mainly by boat to the nearest town.

00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:12.989
There are 32 publishers in the congregation, but on average 150 people attend weekend meetings,

00:59:12.989 --> 00:59:19.710
40% of them children. Our dear brothers and sisters from the Tanembao Sifuni

00:59:19.710 --> 00:59:25.710
congregation in Madagascar send their love and greetings to the worldwide brotherhood.

00:59:26.429 --> 00:59:32.670
From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
