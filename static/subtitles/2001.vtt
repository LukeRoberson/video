00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:09.919
And in production to the book of Malachi, the prophet Malachi wrote this book in Jerusalem

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:14.080
after the Jews returned from Babylon.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:21.059
He proved to be a fearless spokesman for Jehovah.

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:28.219
Malachi completed writing his prophecy sometime after 443 BCE, many years after Haggai and

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:35.299
Zechariah wrote their books, but about the same time Nehemiah wrote his book.

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:41.899
About a century had passed since the first Jewish exiles returned to Jerusalem.

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.740
The temple had been rebuilt, and the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls was completed, but the

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.850
nation still needed spiritual guidance.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.049
The book of Malachi has four chapters.

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:05.049
In chapters one and two, Jehovah denounces the priests for their corrupt practices.

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:12.290
Jehovah calls them to account because they are offering him inferior animals for sacrifice.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.290
The priests have been negligent in teaching the people who are unjustly divorcing their

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:25.310
wives and marrying new wives from pagan nations, something that Jehovah hates.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.950
Chapter 3 indicates there would be a forerunner to the Messiah.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.269
The Messiah or messenger of the covenant will come to the temple to cleanse it.

00:01:37.269 --> 00:01:44.280
Jesus did this when he threw greedy merchants out of the temple.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.959
Did you know Malachi mentions Elijah the prophet.

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:54.959
However, Elijah had been long dead by the time Malachi wrote his prophecy.

00:01:54.959 --> 00:02:01.799
Jesus identified John the baptizer as the Elijah that Malachi foresaw.

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:08.159
In chapter 4, Malachi makes a prophetic reference to the son of righteousness, which highlights

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:12.949
Jesus' role as mankind's savior.

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:19.710
As you read the book of Malachi, notice how Jehovah expects us to give him our best.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:26.030
How Jehovah hates unjust divorce, and how the messenger of the covenant, the foretold king

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.750
of God's kingdom, supports true worship.
