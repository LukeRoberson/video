00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:24.239
But we have been working with Jehovah's Witnesses for 30 years now and have progressively

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:29.079
grown together through this experience.

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:35.200
Jehovah's Witnesses have led us to be extremely cautious with the use of blood, through good

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.880
patient preparation, careful selection of the patient, careful management in the operating

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:50.520
room with all the available blood conservation methods and correcting anemia prior to surgery.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.880
This has resulted, and I have to say, of course, thanks to a relationship that has become

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.399
stronger over the years, it has resulted in a committee within this hospital entrusted

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:07.159
with limiting the use of blood, even for those who are not bound by these restrictions.

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:14.040
So it has been a beneficial process that has also led to a global reduction in the use

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.640
of blood, which we know is harmful and can lead to complications such as those associated

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:32.780
with recovery, as well as avoidable costs.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.060
If anemia is a factor, we treat it beforehand with all the pharmaceutical means we have

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.980
available to correct it.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.099
We have a comedian Verona for the best use of blood that recommends all these procedures

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:49.180
which we also apply to patients who are not Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.980
This is a beneficial process that your presence has allowed us to make.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.340
With this type of preparation, we can address even complex cases of pancreatic resection,

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.819
liver resections.

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:05.780
We do resections of liver tumors, resections of pancreatic tumors, and we can do these

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:17.949
with reasonable, reasonable risks and so perform them safely.

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:23.750
When gastrointestinal oncology, we have come from a rate of 50% of patients transfused

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.629
to 15%.

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.430
So there has been a notable reduction in the use of blood because we have, on the one

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.870
hand, applied more careful surgical techniques and on the other, used all the tools available

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.110
to us for an efficient hemostasis.
