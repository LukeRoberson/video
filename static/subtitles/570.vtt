00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.980
Pay constant attention to your teaching.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.779
In our personal ministry, making return visits,

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:13.179
connecting to Bible study, it's very important for us to listen.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.980
Of course, we're listening to our student,

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.980
but also, are we listening to our teaching to illustrate?

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.780
Suppose we're at the Kingdom Hall,

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.980
and we have alongside of us sitting next to us,

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.780
our Bible student who's there for their first meeting.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.179
Now, as we listen to the public talk,

00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:32.579
we're listening to every point, every sentence,

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.060
maybe every word through the ears of our student.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.259
Sometimes, maybe it makes us cringe a little bit.

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:43.460
Sometimes, we think, ah, well done, good point.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.859
Perfect for to match my student.

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:48.060
Well, we can do this because we know our student

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.460
and what they understand, what they don't understand,

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.859
their sensitivities on certain subjects, etc.

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:57.460
So now, with that in mind,

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.060
we listen to the speaker through the ears of our student.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.659
When we're teaching on a Bible study,

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:08.060
return visit, can we listen to ourselves through the ears

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.459
of our student?

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:12.659
Are we listening or paying attention to our teaching

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.859
as our student is hearing our teaching?

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:21.060
What might be some of the challenges we would listen for?

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.459
Well, to experience circuit overseers who thoroughly enjoy going

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:26.659
on Bible studies with our brothers and sisters,

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.859
mentioned a few challenges that they've noted recently.

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:34.459
Here's one, a weakness I see often is

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:37.859
that publishers rarely invite others to join them

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:41.659
where they always bring along the same person.

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.260
Or another, oftentimes teachers forget

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.659
that the student has gaps in understanding

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.459
and assume they know or understand what is taught.

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:56.260
One mentioned more why questions can help students to reason.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.060
And finally, many friends still spend too much time talking

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.659
and or dissecting the introductory paragraphs

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.459
in the live forever book.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.460
Well, perhaps we have listened to ourselves

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.659
and we find ourselves challenged

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:13.659
with a few of those same points or others.

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:15.860
What can help us?

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.659
Well, for training in the ministry,

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:21.259
we have often turned to the excellent example of

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.259
Aquila and Priscilla as they helped Apollo's.

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:28.860
Let's turn in our Bibles to look at that lesson again.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.460
It's found in Acts chapter 18, starting in verse 24,

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.659
Acts 18, verse 24.

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:41.460
It says, now a Jew named Apollo's, a native of Alexandria,

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.060
arrived in Ephesus.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.659
He was an eloquent man who was well versed in the scriptures.

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.659
This man had been instructed in the way of Jehovah

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.259
and along and a glow with the Spirit.

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:58.259
He was speaking and teaching accurately the things about Jesus,

00:02:58.259 --> 00:03:03.060
but he was equated only with the baptism of John.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.860
He began to speak boldly in the synagogue

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.460
and when Priscilla and Aquila heard him,

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.259
they took him into their company

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:15.259
and explained the way of God more accurately to him.

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:17.259
So now in this example,

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:21.360
we have a case where it was important for someone else

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.159
to hear our teaching and then could render the assistance

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:28.360
we needed, make improvements.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.759
Well, do you recall what the circuit overseer observed?

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:34.960
He said that one weakness I see often is that publishers

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.460
rarely invite others to join them

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.060
or they always bring along the same person.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.460
You can see how that could be a weakness.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.759
But not in this case.

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:45.659
Aquila and Priscilla were there in the synagogue.

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.259
They heard him and they lovingly pulled him aside

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:50.460
and gave him the help that he needed.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.060
And in this lesson, it is also no surprise

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.060
that Priscilla is also mentioned and included

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.560
in a very respectful way working along with her husband

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.659
and assisting Apollo's.

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:06.659
We sense that Priscilla was truly a spiritual woman.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.460
Well, we know it's no different today.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.060
In our congregations, in our Bethel family,

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.060
we have so many spiritually minded, knowledgeable,

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.060
deep thinking sisters is truly a blessing.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.660
And when it comes to teaching the Bible

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.560
on return visits or Bible studies,

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.459
well, so many of our sisters are applying themselves

00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:32.459
and doing an excellent job.

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:35.660
So I asked a few of our sisters here,

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.860
how are they are applying today's text

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.860
to pay constant attention to their teaching?

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:45.459
I'm glad I asked because it was wonderful comments.

00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:47.660
Here's a few samples.

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:51.360
First, they all mentioned the importance of preparation,

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.860
preparation with the student in mind.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.160
And it's obviously applied

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.759
with their learning at the midweek meetings.

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.160
But more specifically, here's one sister

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.660
as she commented about the value of preparation.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.360
She said,

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:09.560
I think it starts in preparing well

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.660
for the return visit or study.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.259
Maybe even over preparing.

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:16.160
Then when on the call or study,

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.560
I'm not focusing on the material

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.060
or distracted by looking for what's coming up next.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.459
I can really focus on the person.

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:28.060
I observe them, their face, their eyes.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.959
Do they seem confused?

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:31.660
Are they uncomfortable?

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.060
Are their eyes opening up as in, wow.

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:38.959
So our sister, having the material so well in mind

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:41.759
is now able to focus on the student

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:46.759
and listen to her teaching as it were observing her student.

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:49.959
Another sister with a similar thought stated,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.259
I have found the preparing myself in advance

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:55.459
with the householder in mind

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:57.759
and wondering what would I like to hear

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:01.959
if I was in her situation with her background?

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:05.560
This helps me know how and what to teach.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.060
So here she is taking the time during preparation

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.560
to listen to the material as it were

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.060
as it's going to be heard through her student

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.560
and then she knows the most effective way to teach it.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.060
And how does having someone else with us along with us help?

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.060
Here's an observation of one of our sisters.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.060
I found that having someone with me

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.560
who after the study can critique the conversation

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.560
to help me to understand clues I might have missed.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.060
Asking my partner what she thinks could be said next time,

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.160
how to say it, what should be avoided?

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.560
This is a tremendous help to me.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.459
So we bring along our Aquila and Priscilla.

00:06:50.459 --> 00:06:53.160
Maybe we bring a variety of Aquila's and Priscilla's

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.560
like our circuit overseer recommends.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.860
And to make the point again,

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.160
the critique was not on the Bible student

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.860
but on our sister or it's for us.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.259
How can I improve?

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:06.459
You be my ears.

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:08.060
Listen for me.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.420
Pay attention to my teaching.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.759
Help me improve.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.259
A beautiful example.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.459
And finally, one of our sisters highlighted

00:07:16.459 --> 00:07:19.360
what she tries to implement in an effective teacher

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.660
as an effective teacher.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.759
First of all, not surprisingly,

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:24.759
she mentioned all the same things regarding

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:26.959
the value of a preparation.

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:29.959
But then she added.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.060
I find it very important to allow the student time

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.660
to express themselves.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.459
I've learned not to mind the awkward silence

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:42.060
which allows them to truly think

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.360
and not feel pressure just to give an answer

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:49.990
but to give a heartfelt answer.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:51.290
Isn't that beautiful?

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:54.889
A beautiful skill to be able to give the student time

00:07:54.889 --> 00:07:57.990
to give a heartfelt answer?

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.990
And then she commented.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:01.490
I try to take an active interest

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:06.389
and remember that this is their time, their study.

00:08:06.389 --> 00:08:08.889
Keeping that in mind helps to motivate me

00:08:08.889 --> 00:08:14.829
to do my best as a teacher to help them.

00:08:14.829 --> 00:08:16.230
It's their time.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:17.329
It's their study.

00:08:17.329 --> 00:08:19.129
Indeed, it's very motivating.

00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:21.329
Well, these were,

00:08:21.329 --> 00:08:23.430
these comments helped me to appreciate

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:26.829
that our sisters are doing their very best

00:08:26.829 --> 00:08:28.629
to teach God's word.

00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:31.029
We are very proud of all of you

00:08:31.029 --> 00:08:33.730
who are trying and doing your best,

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:37.230
paying constant attention to your teaching.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:39.230
Now, these comments that I mentioned

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.129
are just from three sisters I happen to be acquainted with.

00:08:42.129 --> 00:08:43.830
But think worldwide,

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.830
there are millions of our sisters

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.730
who are skillfully preaching and teaching

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:50.929
the good news of the kingdom.

00:08:50.929 --> 00:08:54.929
This is certainly very encouraging to all of us

00:08:54.929 --> 00:08:57.429
to pay constant attention to our teaching.
