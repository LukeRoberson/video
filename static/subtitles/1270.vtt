00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:07.120
Jesus came to bear witness to the truth.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:14.960
Standing on trial before the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate, Jesus boldly stated, as recorded

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:24.920
at John 1837, for this I have come into the world that I should bear witness to the truth.

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:29.800
Who is on the side of the truth listens to my voice.

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:38.679
Jesus used his three-and-a-half-year ministry on earth to teach people the truth about

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:46.359
Jehovah God and His purpose. Those who were on the side of the truth responded favorably,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.960
and wanted to learn more. Others, however, by their response to the good news,

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:02.840
reveal themselves to be enemies of the truth. As Jesus neared the end of His earthly ministry,

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:11.480
He bore witness to the truth during a series of dramatic confrontations in the temple.

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:20.840
What lessons can we learn from the exciting events recorded in Matthew chapter 21 and 22?

00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:28.840
As we will see, these two chapters of Matthew highlight Jesus' courage,

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:37.879
his masterful teaching ability, and his persistence in bearing thorough witness to the truth.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.040
Studying these chapters will help us to imitate Jesus' fine qualities.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.079
Let us begin with Matthew chapter 21.

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:58.040
Verses 12 to 14 relate how Jesus threw out those selling and buying animals in the temple

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:08.759
and overturned the tables of the money changers. These events took place on 9th and 10th 33 CE.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:17.319
The next day, the chief priest directly challenged Jesus' authority to disrupt their business.

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:23.960
How would he respond? Let us start the reading at verse 23.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:03:03.000
After he went into the temple, the chief priest and the elders of the people came up to him

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:11.479
while he was teaching and said, by what authority do you do these things? And who gave you this

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:20.150
authority? I will also ask you one thing. If you tell me, then I will also tell you by what

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:29.590
authority I do these things. The baptism by John from what source was it from heaven or from men?

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:37.990
If we say from heaven, he will say to us, why then did you not believe him?

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:43.750
But if we say from men, we have the crowd to fear for they all regard John as a prophet.

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:54.169
We do not know. We do not know. Neither am I telling you by what authority I do these things.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:02.969
What do you think? A man had two children. Going up to the first, he said,

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:11.610
child, go work today in the vineyard. In answer, this one said, I will not. But afterward,

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:18.889
he felt regret and went out. Approaching the second, he said the same. This one replied,

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:26.970
I will, sir, but did not go out. Which of the two did the will of his father?

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:35.769
The first. Truly, I say to you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going ahead of you

00:04:35.769 --> 00:04:42.170
into the kingdom of God. For John came to you in a way of righteousness, but you did not believe him.

00:04:43.209 --> 00:04:49.610
However, the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. And even when you saw this,

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:56.250
you did not feel regret afterwards so as to believe him. Here another illustration.

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:04.250
There was a man, a landowner, who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a wine

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:10.250
press in it and erected a tower. Then he leased it to cultivators and traveled abroad.

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:16.490
When the fruit season came around, he sent his slaves to the cultivators to collect his fruit.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.730
However, the cultivators took his slaves and they beat one up. Another they killed.

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:28.970
Another they stoned. Again, he sent other slaves more than the first group.

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:35.290
But they did the same to these. Lastly, he sent his son to them, saying,

00:05:36.329 --> 00:05:43.129
they will respect my son. On seeing the son, the cultivators set among themselves,

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.850
this is the heir. Come, let us kill him and get his inheritance.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.730
So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:06:00.490
Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those cultivators?

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:09.769
Because they are evil, he will bring a terrible destruction on them and will lease the vineyard

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:14.889
to other cultivators who will give him the fruits when they become due.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.089
Did you never read in the Scriptures?

00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:24.730
The stone that the builders rejected. This has become the chief cornerstone.

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:29.050
This has come from Jehovah and it is marvelous in our eyes.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:37.129
This is why I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and be given to a nation

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:44.810
producing its fruits. Also, the person falling on this stone will be shattered.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.689
As for anyone on whom it falls, it will crush him.

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:56.889
When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his illustrations, they knew that he was speaking

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:04.810
about them. Although they wanted to seize him, they feared the crowds because these regarded

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:37.560
him as a prophet. In challenging Jesus with the words in verse 23, by what authority do you do

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:47.319
these things? And who gave you this authority? The chief priests and elders show gross disrespect

00:07:47.319 --> 00:07:56.040
for Jehovah, his temple, and his inspired word of truth. Jesus boldly counted their challenge

00:07:56.839 --> 00:08:06.680
with a question that left them speechless, for it exposed them as treacherous and calculating.

00:08:07.879 --> 00:08:15.480
Before they could recover, Jesus followed up with two illustrations. First, he compared the religious

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:24.680
leaders to a rebellious son. They had made a promise to do God's will, but had not kept it.

00:08:25.639 --> 00:08:34.840
Next, Jesus announced them as wicked caretakers of Jehovah's Vineyard, who would be held responsible

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:40.519
for their failure to cultivate the fruitage of faith in God's Son.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:51.240
Jesus illustrations were so masterful that the chief priests and elders, unwittingly,

00:08:51.240 --> 00:09:00.279
pronounced judgment on themselves. The religious leaders were furious and they would have tried

00:09:00.279 --> 00:09:08.679
to kill Jesus, but they feared the crowds. So they took the indirect approach and conspired to

00:09:08.679 --> 00:09:18.360
trap Jesus in his speech. How would Jesus handle this new challenge? Please turn your attention

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:47.289
to Matthew 22, 15 through 33. Then the Pharisees went and conspired together in order to trap him in

00:09:47.289 --> 00:09:53.929
his speech. So they sent their disciples to him together with party followers of Herod, saying,

00:09:55.370 --> 00:10:03.210
Teacher, we know you are truthful and teach the way of God and truth. And you do not seek anyone's

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:08.649
favor for you do not look at the outward appearance of people. Tell us then, what do you think?

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:18.009
Is it lawful to be head-tax to Caesar or not? But Jesus, knowing their wickedness, said,

00:10:18.809 --> 00:10:25.929
why do you put me to the test hypocrites? Show me the tax coin. They brought him a denarius.

00:10:26.889 --> 00:10:33.450
He said to them, whose image and inscription is this? Caesars, Caesars.

00:10:34.409 --> 00:10:40.169
Pay back therefore Caesar's things to Caesar, but God's things to God.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:47.289
When they heard that, they were amazed and they left him and went away.

00:10:48.809 --> 00:10:54.090
On that day, the Sadducees, whose say there is no resurrection, came and asked him,

00:10:54.730 --> 00:11:02.490
Teacher. Moses said, if any man dies without having children, his brother must marry his wife and

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:10.570
raise up offspring for his brother. Now, there were seven brothers with us. The first married and

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:16.169
died, and having no offspring, he left his wife for his brother. The same thing happened with the

00:11:16.169 --> 00:11:24.169
second and the third through all seven. Last of all, the woman died. So in the resurrection

00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:29.370
of the seven, whose wife will she be? For they all had her as a wife.

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:36.250
You are mistaken because you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God.

00:11:37.769 --> 00:11:41.929
For in the resurrection neither do men marry nor are women given in marriage,

00:11:42.809 --> 00:11:44.330
but they are as angels in heaven.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:51.210
Regarding the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God who said,

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:58.169
I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:03.450
He is the God, not of the dead, but of the living.

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:09.769
On hearing that, the crowds were astounded at his teaching.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:44.860
Jesus was approached first by party followers of Herod and disciples of the Pharisees.

00:12:46.059 --> 00:12:51.019
Although these two groups held conflicting political and social views,

00:12:52.059 --> 00:12:55.820
they were united in their hatred for Jesus.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:02.620
Flattering words prefaced a dangerous question.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:07.659
Is it lawful to pay head to access to Caesar or not?

00:13:07.659 --> 00:13:15.340
Had Jesus answered, yes, it is lawful. He could have enraged the crowd.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:22.940
For many would have felt that he was condoning the injustices they suffered at the hands of the Romans.

00:13:23.419 --> 00:13:29.740
On the other hand, a response such as, it is not lawful.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:37.419
It could have sparked a revolt resulting in Jesus' immediate arrest for sedition.

00:13:37.419 --> 00:13:42.940
Jesus did not fall into either trap.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:52.139
Instead, using a coin, he responded with an object lesson that amazed his questioners.

00:13:52.379 --> 00:13:57.419
Next, the Sadducees intending to discredit Jesus,

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:03.899
proposed the scenario that they thought would expose belief in the resurrection

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:12.220
as foolishness. In response, Jesus used flawless reasoning to highlight

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:17.740
scriptural evidence that the Sadducees had apparently never considered before.

00:14:18.379 --> 00:14:23.659
They professed to believe the words of Jehovah recorded at Exodus 3.6.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:29.820
I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:37.019
When Jehovah spoke those words, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had long since died.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:45.100
Yet Jehovah said, I am their God. Not, I was their God.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:50.940
By speaking of these long dead patriarchs as though they were still alive,

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:58.539
Jehovah showed that his purpose to resurrect his fateful servants is sure of fulfillment.

00:15:00.139 --> 00:15:08.139
Additionally, Jesus told the Sadducees that in the resurrection, neither do men marry nor are

00:15:08.139 --> 00:15:16.460
women given in marriage, but they are as angels in heaven. He may have been using the opportunity

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:22.139
to reveal truths about the heavenly resurrection for the benefit of sincere disciples

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:27.580
who would one day be in line to receive such a resurrection.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:36.539
The crowds were astounded at Jesus' authoritative teaching from the Scriptures.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:47.259
Finally, the Pharisees and Sadducees joined forces to test Jesus one last time.

00:15:48.299 --> 00:15:56.379
Hey, scribe from among them, verse in the law, presented a deceptively simple question,

00:15:57.259 --> 00:16:06.139
namely, which is the greatest commandment. In Jesus' day, this was a hotly debated question.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:11.580
Would Jesus say something in answer that would damage his credibility?

00:16:12.779 --> 00:16:23.340
Let us listen to Matthew 22, 34, through 46, to learn from Jesus' response. That's Matthew 22,

00:16:24.139 --> 00:16:53.509
beginning with verse 34. After the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees,

00:16:54.149 --> 00:17:00.470
they came together in one group, and one of them, first in the law, tested him by asking,

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:05.670
Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:14.869
You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:22.470
mind. This is the greatest and first commandment. The second, like it, is this.

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:31.430
You must love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments, the whole law hangs and the

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:37.750
prophets. Now, while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:47.910
what do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he? David's. How is it then that David under

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:53.910
inspiration calls him Lord? Saying, Jehovah said to my Lord,

00:17:54.789 --> 00:18:01.509
sit at my right hand until I put your enemies beneath your feet. If then David calls him Lord,

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:08.710
how is he his son? And nobody was able to say a word and reply to him.

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:48.900
And from that day on, no one dared to question him any further. Quoting from God's word,

00:18:49.779 --> 00:18:58.819
Jesus captured the essence of true worship, love. The mosaic law consisted of more than 600

00:18:58.819 --> 00:19:07.539
individual laws and regulations, yet Jesus, without hesitation, selected the two commandments

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:17.380
on which the whole law hangs. The clear truth of his answer cut through human tradition and empty

00:19:17.859 --> 00:19:27.220
debate. Jesus then turned the tables on his opposers with this question. If the Christ is to be a son

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:36.019
of David, then when is David referred to him in the Psalms as my Lord? More than a mirror riddle,

00:19:36.819 --> 00:19:45.380
this question uncovered the spiritual ignorance of Jesus' enemies. Exposed a spiritually blind,

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:57.740
his opposers never dared to question Jesus again. How can we follow Jesus' example in bearing witness

00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:07.900
to the truth? First, by imitating his courage, Jesus' courage was based on faith in God.

00:20:08.859 --> 00:20:16.299
We grow in faith by praying for Holy Spirit, by meditating on Bible accounts that highlight the

00:20:16.299 --> 00:20:24.779
courageous acts of God's servants, and by allowing what we learn at Christian meetings to sink into

00:20:24.779 --> 00:20:33.420
our hearts. Doing this enables us to build strong faith on the foundation of truth.

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:42.220
Another way that we can follow Jesus' example in bearing witness to the truth is by imitating

00:20:43.019 --> 00:20:49.500
his masterful teaching. We can reach the hearts of sincere listeners with a truth

00:20:50.299 --> 00:21:01.740
by imitating Jesus' use of questions, illustrations, and object lessons, as well as his reasoning

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:12.140
and skillful use of God's written word. Third, we are following Jesus' example when we persevere

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:19.740
in our efforts to bear thorough witness. Never give up in preaching and teaching the good news.

00:21:21.019 --> 00:21:29.019
Those who reject the truth at first may respond later. The inspired record in acts of apostles

00:21:29.019 --> 00:21:37.420
tells us that in time thousands of Jews began paying attention to the good news that had been

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:48.059
preached by Jesus, including a large crowd of priests and some who had been Pharisees.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:57.339
These no longer acted in ignorance. Rather, they repented and gained Jehovah's favor.

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:06.619
So whether you are facing direct challenges or indirect ones, be determined to bear witness to

00:22:06.619 --> 00:22:15.740
the truth as Jesus did.
