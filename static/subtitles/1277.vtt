00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.099
Being single, you can focus more on other people rather than concentrating on yourself.

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:13.099
Being single, having more time, more flexibility really helped me to try to attend this goal,

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.100
which was regular pioneering.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:27.100
Have you singleness as a gift because it opens opportunities to serve more focused and also more flexible?

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:35.100
You can study more, have more time in the field ministry, you have more time for the friends, you're more available.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.100
Singleness definitely is a gift if it's used in the right way for Jehovah.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.100
Singleness has not always been easy.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.100
Sometimes there comes a period in life, a certain age where people start to ask,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.100
and you find already somebody, you're getting married, and that's not always easy.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.100
Sometimes people look at you and even brothers and sisters and feel a bit of pity for you maybe

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.099
because you're still single, and that sort of draws your attention away from what you're doing.

00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:11.099
That sometimes can be difficult.

00:01:11.099 --> 00:01:16.099
I think I got my singleness in the sense that to look out what kind of movies I watch,

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:22.099
not too romantic because it's easy to go in this type of thinking.

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:29.099
I've always made sure that I associate with a range of brothers and sisters from different age groups

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:34.099
but ones that have the similar sort of goals and they have a very positive outlook.

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:40.099
Following Jesus closely as a single, I think it's easier than a couple

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:45.099
because if we reflect on Jesus' life early rise,

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:50.099
a little bit fully focused on the ministry and on his father,

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:53.099
I think it's easier for a single.

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:55.099
He was available to help others.

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:58.099
He was available to teach others even for children.

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:01.099
He was available for them to give comfort.

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:04.099
Jesus was so busy in his ministry and focused.

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:07.099
And when you're single, you're able to do that.

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:13.099
Concentrate more of your energy and effort into the ministry, into serving Jehovah more fully.

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.099
It's not a matter of just being single.

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.099
It's a matter of how you use it to support Jehovah's arrangement.

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.099
It doesn't matter whatever age we are.

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:29.099
If we are single, use the circumstances that you've got at the moment to do whatever you can

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.099
because we're just living in a momentous time.

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.099
There's so much work for us to do.

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:38.099
Just go and pioneer or do something for Jehovah

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.099
and wait for him to surprise you.

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:46.099
You can use this time to do all sorts of different things in Jehovah's service at the moment.

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:52.099
There's so many opportunities open up for single ones, including single sisters now,

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:57.099
going where the needs are greater, moving to different countries, serving in Bethel.

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.099
So while you've got these circumstances, use the time now because it's wonderful.

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.099
It's wonderful.
