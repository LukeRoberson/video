00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:10.419
In the evening of January 6, 1940, the door was called to the door.

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:14.419
I saw the armed people on the street.

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:20.420
They were at home. They opened the door, opened the door.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.420
There was a young man standing there. He said,

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.420
when I opened the door, I opened the door.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.420
When the man opened the door, the young man stood in front of the door.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.420
At that time, the door was opened.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.420
I see that the people were in two masks in the corridor.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.420
There were also eight people.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.420
They said that we had a meeting at your office.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.420
We had a meeting at your house.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.420
They went out of the room right away.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.420
They took everything.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.420
They started the meeting.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.420
They were laughing everywhere.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.420
They said that they were going to the literature

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.420
and the books.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.420
They took the phone and the tablet.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.019
They didn't come back.

00:01:29.019 --> 00:01:32.019
We didn't have to talk to each other.

00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:35.019
We didn't have to call anyone.

00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:38.019
It was about two hours long.

00:01:38.019 --> 00:01:43.019
Then, when the investigator fulfilled all this,

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:45.019
he said,

00:01:45.019 --> 00:01:52.019
you can collect things you don't need at home.

00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:57.019
He even mentioned that half a year, half a year,

00:01:57.019 --> 00:02:00.019
it won't be for you.

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:03.019
We brought the investigator to the committee.

00:02:03.019 --> 00:02:06.019
He immediately took the room.

00:02:06.019 --> 00:02:12.020
We were waiting for him in the corridor.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.020
Then the investigator came to the room.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.020
They brought the other people to our rooms.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.020
It's been seven hours.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.020
We had already decided to ask them to come to the end of the room.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.020
They called the committee and told us

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.020
that I know that you are good people.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.020
You are a family.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.020
Why do you share your life?

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.020
You are a member of the society.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.020
They told us that I and you are a family.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:52.020
We heard that the organization of the illegal family

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.020
was acquitted.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.020
I said that it was heard,

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.020
but it was closed by a legal organization.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.020
It's not like they are separated from the victims.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.020
They started to trust me at first.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.020
That I have a daughter.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.020
That I have a daughter.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.020
He is very rude.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.020
He says, no.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.020
You don't see any family cards.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.020
You don't see any phones.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.020
You can buy new phones,

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.020
new tablet and look for new husband.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.020
When we brought the investigator to the committee,

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.020
the second floor was raised.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.020
My mother immediately became bad and she fell into the sea.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.389
I began to ask her for help

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:41.389
to raise her soon.

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:44.389
All the representatives of the investigation committee

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.389
looked at it.

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:49.389
But they raised her soon.

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:53.280
And in the end, everything was called a circus.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.280
It was very painful.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:02.060
There were a lot of tanks.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.060
I was shocked.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.060
I was very bad.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.169
In the fourth floor,

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:15.169
four hours a day

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:21.170
and I came to see him.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.170
He went to the police station

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.170
and when he came to see me,

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.170
I told him,

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.170
hello, I love you.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.170
He was a bit surprised.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.170
Although it's not good.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.170
And he said,

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.170
I love you too.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.170
And he took him to the office.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:49.170
He took him 15 minutes.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.170
And the investigator came to me too.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.170
He was so excited

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:02.170
with such a happy smile that he did his job.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.170
We are a good person.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.170
Everyone always helps us to do good

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.170
and 9 years old.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.170
It will be 10 years.

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:20.170
And I always used to do everything together.
