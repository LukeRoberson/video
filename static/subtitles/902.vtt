00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:19.260
It's hard to explain a rage, you know, of being angry that I was a witness because I didn't want

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:31.440
to make him angry and make a fight. I wanted to have a good marriage, you know. A few times I'd

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.840
get up in the middle of the night and finish my watchtower, the finished studying for the book

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:43.600
study in the bathroom. It was a safe place. I didn't have the nice family and you're bringing

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:51.119
your kids to the hall and doing things with people. It felt impossible to be a good witness.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:03.780
If anybody called and asked for sister-crosby, it was flipping the angry switch to my husband.

00:01:07.019 --> 00:01:14.219
On a bad day, I did feel sometimes like dying or it'd be easier to die.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.629
Before I was baptized, based on my father's example and the Bible truths that I had learned,

00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:30.829
I believed that maintaining Christian neutrality was the right thing to do.

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:40.590
That's why I refused military training. I received a two-year sentence and was then transferred

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:50.959
to prison. I thought I would meet other brothers, but in my location, there was not a single

00:01:50.959 --> 00:02:02.540
brother there, living with inmates in a cramped cell. I often experienced emotional issues.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.520
During my school years, I experienced much pressure from the teachers,

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:46.240
because my mom was one of Jehovah's Witnesses. They often threatened that they would take us

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.639
children, because I have a younger brother and an older sister to an orphanage.

00:02:55.759 --> 00:03:01.360
The work of Jehovah's Witnesses was under ban, so we had to be very cautious and careful.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.159
The search lasted 12 hours. After that,

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.080
Alive Tina was taken to a temporary detention facility,

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:45.090
and I was interrogated until two in the morning. I said that I had a serious illness,

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.969
and therefore I needed to eat. But in spite of that, they didn't allow it.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:04:04.300
For four months, we did not see each other at all. Every morning, I prayed to endure this test,

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:14.340
and it helped me feel calm. After one court session, as I was waiting to return to myself,

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.339
I met a young female prisoner. And she and I were talking about the name of God,

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.620
and she said to me, wait, wait, wait. I'm going to write the name on the back of this piece of paper

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:47.060
so that I don't forget it. And this girl came out after the search and said,

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.100
when the inspector searched me, she looked at the piece of paper and saw God's name.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.699
And I said to her, don't worry, now neither the inspector nor you will forget the name of God.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:13.470
I prayed a lot to just do the right thing. And then I realized why it's in the Lord's prayer

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.750
to pray to be forgiving because you don't always want to forgive the person,

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.790
but we need to, we have to. And it works when it prayed for help about that.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.750
Meetings in studying were my lifeline to Jehovah besides praying.

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:43.620
Just made me always feel like a witness, but assemblies were hard because it was just hard telling

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:50.420
them. Just going made a man agree. A lot of times I never knew what I'd come home to after

00:05:50.420 --> 00:06:01.740
a assembly or a convention. And I came home as usual. He wasn't there when I came home.

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:06.779
There was 30 seconds. He just went in to go and I pulled up and got out of the car.

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:12.060
He had been waiting there all day for me because he wanted to come out and say something to the

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:19.180
people that dropped me off. Probably not very nice. I think I always felt Jehovah's hand when I came

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:31.019
home. But I was determined to spend my time well. So I applied myself to personal study in order

00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:45.899
to progress spiritually. I prayed earnestly to Jehovah God. Jehovah God, I would be so grateful

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:54.220
if you assigned just one brother to myself. Soon, two brothers were assigned to myself.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:07.980
The three of us tried our best to fully enjoy the meetings. Doing so helped us to endure.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:25.310
At times, issues would arise among the brothers too. Practically no one had any literature at home.

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:37.790
So the meetings were the only source of spiritual food. We had 337 songs in our songbook back then.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:45.660
And I knew almost all of them by heart. So when I got anxious or uneasy,

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:56.060
instead of sinking deep into my thoughts, I simply hummed kingdom songs. I'd prayed earnestly

00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:07.579
and it linked to Jehovah to remain calm toward the teacher. Even though he scolded me or lowered my grades,

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:22.769
I did not consider him an enemy. Some people might think, well, we'd have a better marriage if I

00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:27.889
stopped being a witness. Because people stop studying because their husbands are opposed.

00:08:27.889 --> 00:08:33.570
Well, how do you feel about Jehovah? What do you think? How does he feel?

00:08:34.769 --> 00:08:41.570
If you depend on Jehovah for the help, he'll give it to you and you'll feel it. It built your faith.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:46.129
And you know that you just got through something. You can't believe you just did that.

00:08:46.129 --> 00:08:52.879
It actually happened. And you know that he helped you. I continued to be a witness.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:09:01.389
I could be a witness. It really happened. I've been pioneering for 13 years and I've really

00:09:01.389 --> 00:09:06.990
enjoyed it. I got into study with people and I like talking to people about Jehovah.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:12.990
It really makes you feel good. And even if people aren't nice, they're getting a witness.

00:09:13.629 --> 00:09:16.750
And they have a chance. And who knows what'll happen in the future.

00:09:24.929 --> 00:09:30.370
One thing I learned was that not everything works out the way I expect.

00:09:32.129 --> 00:09:38.289
Even as an elder serving the congregation, I still experience differences of opinion with the

00:09:38.289 --> 00:09:45.809
brothers. But the endurance I learn back then has helped me to peacefully resolve those conflicts

00:09:45.809 --> 00:09:56.559
so that I don't become a stumbling block to others. The endurance I learn back then

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:02.559
has also helped me maintain a happy and peaceful family life with my wife and two sons.

00:10:03.279 --> 00:10:10.779
Even when problems occur in the family. When I watch my sons who are now serving

00:10:10.779 --> 00:10:15.740
alternative civilian service, boldly defend their faith and give a witness in court,

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:22.940
I was reminded of how Jehovah has always provided my father and me during our imprisonment years

00:10:23.019 --> 00:10:31.100
ago. And now my two sons are strength, tenure, as well as everything we need to overcome challenges.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:45.090
In prison, I learned that I had to wait on Jehovah and treat other prisoners kindly.

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:55.250
And so I was always ready to witness to them. Jehovah helped me understand that this was not a

00:10:55.250 --> 00:11:01.090
time for self-pity, but a time to think about others. When you're busy with the kingdom work,

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:13.179
time flies by very quickly. In the mid-1990s, my wife and I came to visit our parents.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:22.179
So one day, on my way to the store through the park, I saw the same history teacher at some distance.

00:11:27.059 --> 00:11:35.620
He lowered his head and was about to cry and said, Ivan, I have caused you so much trouble.

00:11:36.419 --> 00:11:40.500
And yet you came to me and addressed me so kindly.

00:11:41.299 --> 00:11:47.539
From this incident, I learned that it is important to always understand whom the real source of

00:11:47.539 --> 00:11:57.700
persecution is. Not people, but Satan, who uses them as a tool. And just as Jesus said,

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:04.879
that people don't know what they're doing, I felt that this history teacher also didn't know what

00:12:04.879 --> 00:12:14.340
he was doing at the time. But I am well aware that if you sow a good seed, it is bound to bear good

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:23.730
fruit. You just have to wait a little.
