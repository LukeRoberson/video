00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.540
Have you ever heard someone say,

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.540
I'm not religious, but I am spiritual?

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.740
Or, I don't need to belong to a religion.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.240
I worship God in my own way.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.339
Many people believe that they don't need to be associated

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:20.339
with a specific religious organization

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:21.940
and that it's good enough simply

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.640
to have a personal relationship with God.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.739
It's not surprising that they feel that way.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.340
Many religious organizations have promoted false worship.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.539
They've mistreated their followers

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:38.939
or demanded large sums of money from them

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:41.939
and tolerated or even promoted conduct

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:44.939
that the Bible condemns.

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:48.539
Of course, it's the fruitage of those organizations

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.939
that's bad, not the fact that they're organized.

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:55.039
But we might still ask,

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.539
does Jehovah want his people to be organized?

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:01.840
What does his word say?

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.340
The Bible reveals that the early Christians were organized.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.890
Consider what's recorded at Acts chapter 15,

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.989
an issue arose,

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:15.890
an issue involving doctrine or belief

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.890
that caused disagreement among those in the congregation.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.689
How would they settle that issue?

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:25.290
Did they conclude that it was enough for each Christian

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.689
to have his own relationship with God

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.689
and for each person to believe what he personally wanted?

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:36.290
No, that would have divided the young Christian congregation,

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.090
which at this point was less than 20 years old.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.090
At Acts 15 verse 2, we read,

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.090
but after quite a bit of dissension

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.290
and disputing by Paul and Barnabas with them,

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.790
it was arranged for Paul, Barnabas,

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.290
and some of the others to go up to the apostles

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.890
and elders in Jerusalem regarding this issue.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.189
The apostles and elders in Jerusalem

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.790
made a decision that resolved the issue.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.390
Thereafter, they made their decision known to the congregations.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.789
This helped to restore peace and unity.

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:14.490
That wasn't an exceptional case.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.330
Sometime later, the Apostle Paul

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.389
and Timothy visited the congregations.

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:21.289
What did they accomplish?

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:24.689
Acts 16 verse 4 says,

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.289
as they traveled on through the cities,

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:29.689
they would deliver to them for observance,

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:33.289
the decrees that had been decided on by the apostles

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:36.189
and the elders who were in Jerusalem.

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.590
The apostles and elders in Jerusalem

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.990
consistently provided spiritual food,

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.289
direction, and practical help for God's people

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:47.189
in the first century.

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:50.889
They acted as a governing body.

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:54.590
What was the result of such organization?

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.889
Note the next verse.

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:58.189
It says,

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.090
then indeed, the congregations continued

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.490
to be made firm in the faith

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.689
and to increase in number day by day.

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:09.889
That organization in the first century

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.990
helped the early Christians to be united,

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.990
productive, and happy.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.389
In like manner, Jehovah's people today are organized.

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:23.889
This reflects Jehovah's personality.

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:30.689
1 Corinthians chapter 14 verses 33 and 40 says in part,

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:34.590
God is a God not of disorder,

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.289
but of peace.

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:39.289
Let all things take place decently

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:42.289
and by arrangement.

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:43.590
Think about it.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.090
Organization really helps us to fulfill

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.990
Jehovah's requirements for true worship.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.590
Consider five examples.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.090
First, we must be organized to meet together for worship.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.189
How could we do so if we didn't know one another?

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:04.289
Didn't have designated places and times to gather together

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:08.389
and didn't have a scheduled program for each meeting?

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:14.090
Second, we must be organized to be united in belief.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.290
All of us receive the same instruction

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.189
at congregation meetings,

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:20.490
assemblies, and conventions,

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.389
and we're helped to understand the scriptures

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.389
through Bible-based publications and videos.

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.790
These provisions require organization,

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.790
and they help us to worship unitedly

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.990
and as 1 Corinthians 1 verse 10 councils us

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.389
to speak in agreement.

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.490
Third, we must be organized to form

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.889
a worldwide brotherhood.

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.490
1 Peter chapter 2 verse 17 reminds us

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.889
that we belong to an association of brothers.

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:56.990
If we weren't organized,

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.290
how could we even identify those

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.790
who are truly part of our spiritual family?

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.589
Fourth, we must be organized to preach the good news

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:11.089
to people of different nations, tribes, and languages.

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:14.089
How could we possibly declare the kingdom message thoroughly

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:19.889
and effectively if we weren't associated with an organization?

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:25.889
Fifth, we must be organized to provide disaster relief.

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:28.689
Just as the early Christians had an arrangement

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:31.089
to supply financial aid to their needy brothers

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:33.089
and sisters in other lands,

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:36.689
so we are organized to help our brothers and sisters

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:39.889
as soon as possible after a disaster,

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.290
disease outbreak, or other emergency.

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.889
As was the case in the first century,

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:50.290
the governing body today provides spiritual food,

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.889
direction, and practical help for God's people around the world.

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:57.490
Jesus has appointed that governing body

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.589
to be the faithful and discreet slave.

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:05.689
How grateful we are that Jehovah through our leader Jesus Christ

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:09.389
has organized us so that we can do God's will

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:11.490
as a united brotherhood.
