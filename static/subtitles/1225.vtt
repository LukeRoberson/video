WEBVTT

00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:14.349
Come on, y'all, it'll be good.

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:15.349
Let me see.

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:20.260
Go out and meet her.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:33.619
Thank you, Tasia.

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:40.750
Dustin, okay, talk to me.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.750
There's nothing to talk about.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.750
I know this whole move hasn't been easy,

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.750
but it's only temporary,

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.750
and so we're able to get back on our feet.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.750
It's not just a move.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.750
It's everything.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.750
It's all upside down.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.750
The good thing is,

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:56.750
are not alone.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:57.750
We have help.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.750
And it's the best kind of help,

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.750
because it comes from Jehovah.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.750
And he will never let you down.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.750
But it's up to you to give him a chance.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.750
We're in this together, okay?

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.750
Leah, we're so happy that you all are here with us.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:15.750
Thanks, Mom.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.750
I don't know how long we'll be here,

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.750
but we'll try and help out as much as we can.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.750
You stay with us as long as you need you.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.750
Thanks, Dad.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.750
I thought Tasia would be down by now.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.750
She said she had a headache.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.750
I'll go check on her.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:02:37.060
Leah, is everything okay?

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.060
Oh, yeah.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.060
I don't read things fine.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.060
You're doing a wonderful job, you're now.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.060
Am I ever since Scott left us?

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.060
Nothing has been...

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.060
Leah, it's not your fault.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.060
Scott left Jehovah.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.060
And now I'm losing my job.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.060
I'm trying so hard to be strong for the kids,

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.620
but Dad, inside, I...

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.620
Leah, the scriptures are so encouraging and helpful,

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.620
in situations like this.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:19.180
Please read for me Psalm 27, verse 14.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.180
Open Jehovah, be courageous and strong of heart.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.500
Yes, hope and Jehovah.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.500
I don't feel very courageous, Dad.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.500
But you can be, Leah, dear.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.500
The key is in the first sentence of that verse,

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.500
hope and Jehovah.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.500
You see, meditating on our hope

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.500
enables us to build courage right now.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.500
And with courage like that,

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.500
you'll be able to meet any challenge.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:08.340
You'll see.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.340
Tasia, come taste this for me, please.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:21.430
Mmm, it smells good.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.430
What taste good?

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.430
Maybe I just a little bit more cumin.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.430
Okay.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.430
So, any plans for this weekend?

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.430
Well, I'm going to get an early stir on the service,

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.430
and then come home and finish my book.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.430
Don't you want to go out with some friends

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.430
and have some fun?

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.430
Yeah, that'd be nice.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.430
What's the matter?

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.430
Well, first, you need friends.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.800
Oh, this must be about my job interview.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.800
I'll be right back.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.819
Okay.

00:04:57.819 --> 00:04:58.819
Yes.

00:04:58.819 --> 00:04:59.819
I need to talk to you.

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:01.819
Why hasn't the congregation

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:04.819
taken more than interest in Leah and the kids?

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:06.819
It's been two months.

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:08.819
We've invited people over to our home.

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:11.819
Well, this, as you said, it's only been two months.

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:13.819
No, Ben, that's not it.

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:16.819
When I was out in service this morning,

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:19.819
I heard that someone invited the camels over.

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.819
They just moved here.

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:24.819
I know I'm being biased,

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:28.819
but I can't think of a sweeter girl than Tasia,

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:32.819
and the fact that she's having a hard time finding friends?

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:35.819
They've all been through so much.

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:37.819
It just hurts.

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:38.819
I expected more.

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:47.230
They've all been through so much.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:48.230
It just hurts.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.230
I expected more.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.230
Well, you know what I think.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.230
What?

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.230
That I'm completely overreacting as a grandmother?

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:00.230
No.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.230
No.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.230
You're a wonderful grandmother,

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.230
and you're probably right.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.230
But, although we may feel justified,

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.230
we have to remember that the congregation

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.230
is made up of imperfect people,

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.230
and they're doing the best they can.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.230
I know that.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.230
They're going to have their feeling moments,

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.230
but they'll have their shining ones also.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.230
Like when you were sick years ago,

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.230
we both needed them,

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.230
and they were there for us.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:36.230
It reminds me of what the Psalmist said.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:41.230
Jehovah is my light and my salvation,

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:45.230
and notice he said, Jehovah, not people.

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.230
True.

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:48.230
Okay.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.230
I'm going to try and leave it in Jehovah's hands.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.230
I do trust Jehovah.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.230
Now, that's my Abbey.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:07:00.230
Hey, remember when we used to recount three things every day

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.230
that we were thankful for?

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:04.230
Why don't we start doing that again?

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.230
Okay.

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.230
That sounds like a good idea.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:12.230
And I can already think of one thing I'm thankful for today.

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:18.740
I miss you.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:19.740
Thank you.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:20.740
You're welcome.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.740
You know, we really appreciate the both of you inviting us over.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:25.740
It's our pleasure.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.740
We really love having Lee and the kids with us.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.740
Actually, we've been wanting to do this for quite a while,

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.740
but we just haven't had the chance until now.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.740
We appreciate it.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:35.740
Come on.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:50.899
Thanks again, Grandpa, for a fun service morning.

00:07:50.899 --> 00:07:52.899
You haven't even planned for later?

00:07:52.899 --> 00:07:54.899
Yeah, meeting some friends later at the movie theater.

00:07:54.899 --> 00:07:55.899
Ah, have a good time.

00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:56.899
Thanks.

00:07:56.899 --> 00:08:16.259
It just looks kind of...

00:08:16.259 --> 00:08:21.050
It's nice of you.

00:08:24.579 --> 00:08:29.980
Look, I just think maybe we need to leave.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.980
I really think we need to leave.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:32.980
Hey, it's going on.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.259
That's the tip.

00:08:35.259 --> 00:08:36.259
It's just a seed.

00:08:36.259 --> 00:08:37.259
Yeah.

00:08:37.259 --> 00:08:38.259
Don't just chill.

00:08:38.259 --> 00:08:39.259
Hey.

00:08:39.259 --> 00:08:40.259
We're trying to watch a movie.

00:08:40.259 --> 00:08:41.259
Let's cut the chit chat.

00:08:41.259 --> 00:08:42.259
I'm sorry.

00:08:42.259 --> 00:08:56.090
Hey.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:57.090
We're trying to watch a movie.

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.090
Let's cut the chit chat.

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:06.580
I'm sorry.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:07.580
Good morning, sir.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.580
My grandson and I like to share it.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:10.580
The job is right.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.580
I'm going to save you some trouble.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.580
I'm a professor, and I've read some of your books,

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.580
but the science in them is really out of date.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.580
Why do you people insist on writing about things you don't understand?

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.580
It is true, sir, that over time,

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.580
scientific research can become out of date.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.580
But you know, there's a book that is never out of date.

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:31.580
The Bible.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:37.580
Dustin, would you please read Isaiah chapter 40 verse 22 for the gentleman?

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:41.580
There is one who dwells above the circle of the earth,

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.580
and his inhabitants are like grasshoppers.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.580
He is stretching out the heavens like a fine dog.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.580
Wow.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.580
That ended so much better than I expected.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.580
He was so intimidating.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.580
It's normal to feel that way, Dustin.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.580
I've even had those feelings.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:59.580
Even the apostles have had their moments.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.580
I'd like to show you something.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:05.580
It's an Acts chapter 4.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.580
Would you find that a read?

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.580
Acts chapter 4 verse 29.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:15.580
Let's see what the apostles prayed for.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.580
And now in Jehovah,

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.580
give attention to their threats

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.580
and grant to your slaves to keep speaking your word with all boldness.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.580
You see the point, Dustin?

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.580
Jehovah helped the apostles,

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.580
and he's going to help us.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:33.580
So we never, ever have to feel ashamed of the truth.

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:41.370
I'm out of here.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:56.750
Dustin, I'm not going back, Jamie.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:57.750
Yeah, I know.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:58.750
Me neither.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.750
My mom's going to come pick me up.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:02.750
You want to write it?

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:03.750
Yeah, sure.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:12.210
All right.

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:14.210
Mom, dinner was very good.

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:15.210
Thank you.

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:16.210
You're welcome.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.210
You know, it really is good to see you all.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:20.210
Five years is a long time.

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:21.210
It is.

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:22.210
When dad told me you were coming,

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:24.210
I couldn't wait to see you.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:33.220
I have gifts.

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.220
It's beautiful.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.220
Thank you.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:37.220
You're welcome.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.220
What?

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.220
This is the latest model.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.220
Thanks, Uncle Jackson.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.220
You're welcome.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.220
Wow, this is very professional.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.220
Professional.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.220
I want you to come work for me.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.220
I don't know what to say.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.220
I just want to help.

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.220
So let me.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:54.220
A century level.

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.220
What with benefits and bonuses?

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.220
What are the hours?

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:00.220
Anything like yours?

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.220
Not as intense.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.220
A full-time, weekends, evenings, too.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.220
But you'll be able to save money.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.220
Buy a home.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:10.220
Got a job for you, too.

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:12.220
You can even buy a car.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.220
And anytime you want to come to the agency,

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.220
it's open.

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.220
We'll make it a family business.

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.980
And this is work.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:34.419
Excuse me.

00:12:34.419 --> 00:12:46.629
You two help me with the dishes?

00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:48.629
I could use the job, Dad.

00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:51.629
It wouldn't be so bad to work the extra hours.

00:12:51.629 --> 00:12:55.629
I can't make that decision for you.

00:12:55.629 --> 00:12:59.629
Your brother loves you very much.

00:12:59.629 --> 00:13:03.629
And he genuinely wants to help.

00:13:03.629 --> 00:13:07.629
But as you know, he never made the truth his own.

00:13:07.629 --> 00:13:18.519
So you've got to figure out if his offer is worth the cost.

00:13:18.519 --> 00:13:25.519
Remember, extra hours means extra association.

00:13:25.519 --> 00:13:30.519
And Proverbs chapter 13 verse 20 says,

00:13:30.519 --> 00:13:36.519
The one walking with the wise will become wise.

00:13:36.519 --> 00:13:53.259
Jackson, I want to thank you for offering to give me a job.

00:13:53.259 --> 00:13:54.259
You got it.

00:13:54.259 --> 00:13:55.259
I'll set up an interview.

00:13:55.259 --> 00:13:57.259
But I have to turn it down.

00:13:57.259 --> 00:13:58.259
Dad talked to you.

00:13:58.259 --> 00:13:59.259
Didn't he?

00:13:59.259 --> 00:14:00.259
This isn't coming from Dad.

00:14:00.259 --> 00:14:01.259
It's coming from me.

00:14:01.259 --> 00:14:05.259
I just can't sacrifice spiritual things for material ones.

00:14:05.259 --> 00:14:07.259
I hope you can understand.

00:14:07.259 --> 00:14:09.259
Jackson, I love you.

00:14:09.259 --> 00:14:10.259
We all do.

00:14:10.259 --> 00:14:12.259
And we want to see you come back and visit us.

00:14:12.259 --> 00:14:14.259
But please, for my sake,

00:14:14.259 --> 00:14:17.259
don't promote different goals for the kids when you come.

00:14:17.259 --> 00:14:20.259
I'm trying hard to help them set spiritual priorities.

00:14:20.259 --> 00:14:21.259
Okay?

00:14:21.259 --> 00:14:23.259
All right.

00:14:23.259 --> 00:14:25.259
It's been a while, but come on.

00:14:25.259 --> 00:14:26.259
Give me a hug.

00:14:26.259 --> 00:14:27.259
You know I'm keeping the bag, right?

00:14:27.259 --> 00:14:28.259
Okay.

00:14:28.259 --> 00:14:39.220
Rightness because of my foes.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:40.220
Good morning.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:42.220
You're not hand me over to my address.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.220
It's my address.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:46.220
Yeah, they called an ask if I could do a double shift today.

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:47.220
I see.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:50.220
Grandpa, I'm sorry you had to give up your office space for me.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.220
Don't be, Tasia.

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.220
Besides, this suits me better.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:59.220
For me, being outside makes personal study more enjoyable.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:02.220
Well, I hope you enjoy the rest of your day, and I'll see you later.

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.220
Thanks. We'll see you when you get back.

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.220
Okay.

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:11.500
Okay, I found you.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:12.500
Oh, hey.

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.500
Yeah, I decided to take my breakout site.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:15.500
Okay, cool.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.500
But when you get back, Denise was looking for you.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:18.500
Okay, thanks.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.500
I'm making this dressing, but I just missed something.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:22.500
Can you try it?

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:23.500
Yeah, of course.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.500
It's a little bit more lemon.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:28.929
More lemon.

00:15:28.929 --> 00:15:29.929
Yeah.

00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:30.929
Can you have beef?

00:15:30.929 --> 00:15:36.029
Hey, can I borrow some of your hot pepper please?

00:15:36.029 --> 00:15:37.029
Yeah, sure.

00:15:37.029 --> 00:15:46.100
Come here now.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.570
The salad?

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:49.570
Yep.

00:15:49.570 --> 00:16:03.340
Hey, are you going to come with us?

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.340
I'll think, Denise, but no, I don't think so.

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:07.340
Come on.

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:08.340
I'll say no again.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:09.340
I'm sorry.

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:10.340
I have other plans.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.340
Oh, you have other plans, huh?

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:14.340
Oh, I get it.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:15.340
You have a secret boyfriend.

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.340
Or a girlfriend?

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:17.340
Wait, what?

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:18.340
Come on.

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.340
Whatever you're into, it's all right with us.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:23.340
Just let us in on it.

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:24.340
What's the deal?

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:32.269
Whatever you're into, it's all right with us.

00:16:32.269 --> 00:16:35.519
Just let us in on it.

00:16:35.519 --> 00:16:36.519
What's the deal?

00:16:36.519 --> 00:16:43.860
Moses must have felt inadequate and incapable.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:47.860
But God has shared him that he would not be alone.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.860
I will prove to be with you, said Jehovah.

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:56.899
Look, I don't have a boyfriend or girlfriend.

00:16:56.899 --> 00:16:58.899
I have a Bible study.

00:16:58.899 --> 00:17:00.899
I'm one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:17:00.899 --> 00:17:03.899
And we volunteer a time to help people learn about the Bible.

00:17:03.899 --> 00:17:04.900
The Bible?

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.900
Oh, come on.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:07.900
That book is ancient.

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.900
It closes your mind into new ideas.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.900
Actually, it doesn't.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.900
It gives people a wonderful hope for the future.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.900
Well, I believe we make our own future.

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.900
I'm sorry you don't feel the same.

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:21.900
Come on.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:33.279
Let's go.

00:17:33.279 --> 00:17:36.279
So, we told him I was one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:17:36.279 --> 00:17:38.279
I'm just glad they know now.

00:17:38.279 --> 00:17:40.279
We're so proud of you for standing up like that.

00:17:40.279 --> 00:17:42.279
Yeah, I surprised myself.

00:17:42.279 --> 00:17:45.279
I just wish it ended a little bit better.

00:17:45.279 --> 00:17:50.279
No matter the response, you made Jehovah happy today.

00:17:50.279 --> 00:17:51.279
Thanks, Grandpa.

00:17:51.279 --> 00:18:04.180
Hey.

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:05.180
Hey.

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:09.180
The other day, you said something about that you do Bible studies.

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:14.180
And it reminded me of something my mom and I used to do together before she died.

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:16.180
She would read the Bible to me before bed.

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:20.180
So, I was wondering if you would show me what you show other people.

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:24.180
Of course, I'm really sorry to hear that about your mom.

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:33.690
Did you know that the Bible actually gives us the hope for a resurrection?

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:37.690
Next, we have Brother Ben Matthews with us.

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:45.690
Brother Matthews, you've been able to raise a family, serve as an elder and pioneer for many years.

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:48.690
What a good example of faith and courage.

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:51.690
Thank you, Brother Nicoletti.

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:57.690
But truthfully, courage isn't something that comes easy to me.

00:18:57.690 --> 00:18:59.690
I have to keep working on it.

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:00.690
Why is that?

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:06.690
Well, I remember years ago when my wife Abby became very ill.

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:13.690
She was in the hospital for months while I cared for our newborn son and young daughter.

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:15.690
I didn't know if she would ever recover.

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:21.690
I prayed and prayed and it appeared as if nothing changed.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:27.690
I could feel my faith beginning to crack and give way to doubt.

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:32.690
I even started doubting Jehovah's promises for the future.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:34.690
So, what changed that?

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:37.690
A friend stepped in at the right time.

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:43.690
He encouraged me when I was home alone to read David's words at Psalm 27.

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:46.690
At first, I didn't want to.

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:48.690
But eventually, I did.

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:53.690
And something about those words touched my heart.

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:59.690
You see, like a plant deprived of water, I was starving my faith.

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:05.690
So, I kept reading and meditating on those words in Psalm 27.

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:09.690
And eventually, my doubts began to melt away.

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:12.690
But as you mentioned, Brother Matthews, that was decades ago.

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:16.690
You said courage is something that you're continuing to work on.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:21.690
Well, for much of my life, I've had to help other people be courageous.

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:31.450
But recently, I found out that soon, I will go blind.

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:38.450
Between this and not being able to do as much in the congregation as I used to,

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:42.450
well, I could feel those doubts creeping up again.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:48.450
I think it's easier to help others be courageous.

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:52.450
You'll be able to meet any challenge.

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:57.450
Jehovah is my light and my salvation.

00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:01.450
Jehovah helped the apostles, and he's going to help us.

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:06.450
No matter the response, you made Jehovah happy today.

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:10.450
It's harder to be courageous for yourself.

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:14.450
We empathize with you, Brother Matthews.

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:18.450
Can you tell us what you're doing right now to build courage?

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:20.450
Absolutely.

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:22.450
Here's my prescription.

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:25.450
Regular prayer and study.

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:29.450
Application of the Bible's guidance.

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:31.450
Attending as many meetings as I can.

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:36.450
And, of course, preaching to others about our hope.

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:39.450
That's a very good prescription.

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:43.450
There's a particular scripture that has meaning for you right now.

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:47.450
Right now, it's Hebrews chapter 11, verse 6.

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:55.450
It says, moreover, without faith, it is impossible to please God well

00:21:55.450 --> 00:22:00.450
for whoever approaches God must believe that He is

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:07.450
and that He becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking Him.

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:12.450
So, even if I lose my eyesight, Brother Nicoletti,

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:20.450
I will continue to seek Jehovah with my family and my eyes of faith.

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:25.450
Thank you, Brother Matthews, for being such a good example of courage.
