WEBVTT

00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:08.490
Jesus taught us that Satan is the father of the lie.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.089
We recall that he deceived Eve a perfect woman.

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:17.730
He lied about our precious Jehovah.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.489
Now you're familiar with many of you with Revelation chapter 12, invite you to find that

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:27.289
Revelation chapter 12.

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:34.729
And in this chapter, verses 7 and 8, address the fact that the war broke out in heaven,

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:43.450
but notice after they're kicked out of heaven, in verse 9, we read, so down the great dragon

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:52.329
was hurled, the original serpent, the one called devil and Satan, who is misleading the entire

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.329
inhabited earth.

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.450
He was hurled down to the earth and his angels were hurled down with him.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:10.090
Now I read it that way specifically, but see what it doesn't say is, in the middle part

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:20.250
of verse 9, Satan, who's trying to mislead the entire inhabited earth, no.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.569
He is misleading the entire inhabited earth.

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:32.370
That's crucial to understand when we think about the theme of this talk, not to be misled

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:40.609
by imitation peace, because as the rule of the world, that's what he's out to do is mislead.

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:49.969
In fact, an interesting point here, in 2 Corinthians chapter 11, to appreciate how he

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:59.090
goes about misleading, or at least it's addressed here to serve as a good warning for us.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.930
An interesting point with the revision of the New World translation, for those of you

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:14.050
in the truth before 2013, when it was revised, you'll remember this, we'd see verse 14,

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:21.569
2 Corinthians chapter 11, and no wonder for Satan himself keeps disguising himself as

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.889
an angel of light.

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:33.490
Now the New World translation used to say before the revision transforms himself into an angel

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:34.490
of light.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:43.050
Well, the very English word metamorphosis, like for a caterpillar transforming into a

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.050
beautiful butterfly, that's where it comes from the Greek language.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:54.530
And that word was not in verse 14, no.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:01.409
Because Satan can't transform himself into an angel of light, so it's an improved translation,

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:11.689
but he does disguise, he's a masquerader, and he does that with the subject of peace.

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:18.409
His world offers a sort of peace, but it's imitation peace.

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:25.009
Now, Jesus has distinguished, though, with the peace that he gives, and if you'll follow

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:34.449
long here in John, in chapter 14, he himself explains it to us, and we treasure the

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:40.610
gospel accounts, verse 27, I leave you peace.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.370
I give you my peace.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.289
I do not give it to you the way the world gives it.

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:52.250
Do not let your hearts be troubled, nor let them shrink out of fear.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:04:00.689
So Jesus gives us his peace, and the peace that Jesus gives us, it's this inner calm,

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:04.650
once you know the truth, and Jesus gives us the peace.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.889
We have this confidence that he loves us, Jehovah loves us, that we enjoy a good, peaceful

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:16.250
relationship with them, and a good conscience.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:22.170
And we look forward to the kingdom removing all war and death.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:31.329
Now, point to make here, Satan wants us to trade the peace that Jesus gives for his

00:04:31.329 --> 00:04:38.209
imitation peace that he has advertised in the world.

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:47.490
Now in this talk, we will consider three forms of imitation peace, and why the peace that

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.290
Jesus gives is superior.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:59.850
The first one has to do with material things, how they'll not bring true peace, and to

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:09.089
help us with that, it's turned to Matthew chapter 4, and we'll be referring to this chapter

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:14.689
throughout this particular talk about, not being misled by imitation peace, and this

00:05:14.769 --> 00:05:19.689
one connected with material things, how they don't bring true peace in the example Jesus

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:21.370
sets for us here.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:28.569
So Matthew chapter 4, then Jesus was led by the Spirit up into the wilderness to be tempted

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:30.649
by the devil.

00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:35.850
After he had fasted for forty days and forty nights, he felt hungry.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:42.370
In the tempter approached and said to him, if you are a son of God, tell these stones

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.730
to become loaves of bread.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:53.970
But he answered, it is written, man must live not on bread alone, but on every word that

00:05:53.970 --> 00:06:03.250
comes from Jehovah's mouth, that a beautiful rebuttal, see Jesus refused to trade his peace

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:09.850
for material things, and in this case bread, even though he was hungry.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:17.329
So serving Jehovah was more important to him than material things, see, and in the world

00:06:17.329 --> 00:06:26.009
they have this thinking about, well, you need a certain amount of money to retire and

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:37.089
they're constantly focused on material things, not Jesus, see, superior peace from Jehovah

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:38.569
God.

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:46.290
So it's only temporary anyway that the material benefits that people seek and pursue throughout

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:47.930
their lives.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:55.569
Now we can enjoy true contentment because Jehovah God is going to care for us.

00:06:55.569 --> 00:07:01.050
We know that many have personal experiences to prove that.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:07.850
So in the following video, see what a brother learned about the so-called peace the world

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:15.610
promises.

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:19.209
As a family, we were doing very well spiritually.

00:07:19.209 --> 00:07:26.259
We did family worship, preaching, and going to the meetings together.

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:30.819
After some time, we began to encounter financial problems.

00:07:30.819 --> 00:07:38.230
At times, we did not even have money to buy food for each day.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:43.949
Many people in our area were going to South Africa to provide basic needs for their families.

00:07:43.949 --> 00:08:00.949
So I decided to go as well, leaving behind my wife to take care of our seven children.

00:08:00.949 --> 00:08:06.910
This affected me spiritually because I did not know the language, I was unable to preach,

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:10.069
and I did not benefit from the meetings.

00:08:10.069 --> 00:08:16.910
Being so far from my family caused me to neglect my responsibility as a family head.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:23.629
As a result, my family grew weak spiritually, and we all missed each other very much.

00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:28.110
I realized that I had made a wrong decision going abroad.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:31.670
My conscience started to trouble me greatly.

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:39.769
Then I remembered the example of Barak, founded Jeremiah chapter 45, verse 5.

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:44.919
Barak may have wanted to pursue material riches as I had.

00:08:44.919 --> 00:08:48.799
When he was helped, he returned.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:55.639
I decided then to put Jehovah in first place instead of searching for material things.

00:08:55.639 --> 00:09:03.070
So I started to make changes to go home and help my family spiritually.

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:10.149
When I left South Africa and reached the border of Malawi, after leaving my family for about six months,

00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:16.870
I felt great happiness in my heart, and I am still happy till now.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.830
Studying the Bible has helped me.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:25.110
We still encounter financial problems, but I remember that in Satan's world,

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:29.350
there is no way we can go and have no problems.

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:32.629
Now I serve as an elder.

00:09:32.629 --> 00:09:38.590
My family is progressing spiritually, and this makes me very happy

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:48.649
because my relationship with Jehovah is strong.

00:09:48.649 --> 00:09:53.049
Yes, he learned a hard lesson.

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:59.929
He goes to South Africa, meetings are interrupted, no field service,

00:09:59.929 --> 00:10:05.690
and then he remembers Barak, Secretary for Jeremiah,

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:10.289
and he returns to be with his family, putting the kingdom first,

00:10:10.289 --> 00:10:15.009
and we appreciate him being truthful and sharing that experience.

00:10:15.009 --> 00:10:20.929
That's imitation peace going after material things.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:26.970
Now, this next is quite interesting, so pay close attention,

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:31.730
because there may be some listening that need this council.

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:36.850
Satan's world says that we can ignore Bible standards,

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:42.009
and we might need to ignore some of them to gain peace of mind.

00:10:42.009 --> 00:10:46.610
Here's two examples that we're going to analyze in this talk.

00:10:46.649 --> 00:10:51.490
A person may reason that marrying an unbeliever

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:58.610
or obtaining an unscriptural divorce will make life easier.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:02.889
And they start reasoning.

00:11:02.889 --> 00:11:05.970
I just want to get married, and he's an unbeliever,

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:08.370
but he's a nice person.

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:12.330
Things like that go on with the treacherous heart.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:16.970
Again, we go to the example of our Lord and Master Jesus.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:23.490
We're going to read verses five through seven of Matthew four.

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:27.409
Then the devil took him along into the holy city,

00:11:27.409 --> 00:11:30.889
and he stationed him on the battlement of the temple,

00:11:30.889 --> 00:11:35.330
and said to him, if you are a son of God,

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:38.850
throw yourself down for it is written.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:42.370
He will give his angels a command concerning you,

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:44.970
and they will carry you on their hands

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:49.769
so that you may not strike your foot against a stone.

00:11:49.769 --> 00:11:54.129
Jesus said to him, again, it is written,

00:11:54.129 --> 00:11:59.730
you must not put your whole of your God to the test.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:03.330
See, Jesus made that very clear.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.090
He was going to be obedient to his father,

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:10.490
and wasn't going to worry about being testy

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:15.529
with such an experience as the devil proposed there.

00:12:15.529 --> 00:12:20.009
So obedience.

00:12:20.009 --> 00:12:23.850
See, Jesus twice in a moment will read another one.

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:24.610
It is written.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:25.929
He sticks with the scriptures.

00:12:25.929 --> 00:12:32.929
Jehovah's thinking, and he refused to disobey Jehovah.

00:12:32.929 --> 00:12:35.850
Now, here's the question.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:39.970
Why is the piece that Jesus gives superior

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:47.409
to the pursuit of unscriptural solutions to our problems?

00:12:47.409 --> 00:12:49.250
Let that sink in.

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:53.490
Why is the piece that Jesus gives superior

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:57.210
to the pursuit of unscriptural solutions to our problems?

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:01.409
For example, marrying an unbeliever.

00:13:01.409 --> 00:13:05.490
That will likely bring, and it has happened time after time,

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:09.700
bring that person greater pain

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:13.019
than the longing they felt when they were single.

00:13:13.019 --> 00:13:16.340
I've personally seen that all too many times

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:22.299
in various congregations at the privilege to serve in.

00:13:22.299 --> 00:13:27.620
You see, the other one is unscriptural divorce.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:30.460
It often leads to immoral conduct.

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:33.700
It certainly leads to a troubled conscience,

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:39.899
emotional damage, and of course, a loss of privileges.

00:13:39.899 --> 00:13:44.179
Now, this is very important to keep in mind

00:13:44.179 --> 00:13:48.620
while it's true to imperfect individuals

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.299
married to each other.

00:13:50.299 --> 00:13:52.860
Well, there's going to be difficulties.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.779
There's going to be challenges.

00:13:55.779 --> 00:13:59.539
But see, stop and think about this.

00:13:59.539 --> 00:14:01.820
When you're having difficulties,

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:08.379
don't forget that marriage is a sacred arrangement.

00:14:08.379 --> 00:14:12.299
The world totally has forgotten that.

00:14:12.299 --> 00:14:20.460
So Jehovah will strengthen both to make a success.

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:21.539
Gotta keep that in mind.

00:14:21.539 --> 00:14:26.539
Jehovah will strengthen and help so that you can succeed

00:14:26.539 --> 00:14:29.100
because this is his sacred arrangement.

00:14:29.139 --> 00:14:32.820
And the devil has been attacking the family arrangement

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.460
all through the last days of the system.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:39.659
And he's intensifying it as he gets closer

00:14:39.659 --> 00:14:43.659
to being thrown into the abyss.

00:14:43.659 --> 00:14:46.539
Now, in the following video, notice

00:14:46.539 --> 00:14:53.570
the results of pursuing imitation peace.

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:58.009
newly married life came with a lot of unexpected challenges.

00:14:58.009 --> 00:15:01.370
You dream about the way your marriage will go,

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:06.990
but then the reality is quite different.

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:12.309
All we ever did was argue, or we wouldn't speak to one another.

00:15:12.309 --> 00:15:14.350
We never ever went to the elders.

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:15.950
We just didn't want to bother them.

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:22.259
We just felt we needed to figure it out ourselves.

00:15:22.259 --> 00:15:32.460
We decided if the household that we would separate.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.340
The separation wasn't a good thing

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:38.539
because in some respects, it made things worse.

00:15:38.539 --> 00:15:40.220
It did have an impact on the boys.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:41.779
They started acting out.

00:15:41.779 --> 00:15:48.019
They got into some trouble with the police one time.

00:15:48.019 --> 00:15:51.980
And there was a loneliness because you've gotten married.

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:55.139
And now you don't have that, and you're by yourself.

00:15:55.139 --> 00:15:57.100
And the same old routine went on

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:02.539
where you're cooking and cleaning and doing laundry and working.

00:16:02.539 --> 00:16:04.779
I felt sick to my stomach.

00:16:04.779 --> 00:16:07.299
I had a hard time getting up every morning

00:16:07.299 --> 00:16:08.940
and facing the world.

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:14.179
At that point, I felt that I needed to have the elders help out a little bit.

00:16:14.179 --> 00:16:17.460
I did pray for Jehovah's help to direct me.

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:22.460
And kept wondering why Jehovah wasn't really answering my prayers.

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:27.980
But I kind of realized now that it was because we were separated.

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:33.019
The expectations of the separation were not at all what I was thinking.

00:16:33.019 --> 00:16:36.179
I reflected on the marriage vows.

00:16:36.179 --> 00:16:40.779
One of the things I thought about was a sister in our congregation.

00:16:40.779 --> 00:16:44.340
She was married to an unbeliever, and then she learned the truth.

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.620
And he was so violent.

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:47.899
He would beat her.

00:16:47.899 --> 00:16:49.620
He would burn her books.

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.139
He would burn her clothes.

00:16:51.139 --> 00:16:54.179
He did not allow her children to attend the meetings.

00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:57.100
And I thought about the problems that Darryl and I had.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.100
And I thought, well, Darryl's a kind person.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.500
He's never done that.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:05.259
And I thought, you know, this is something that we need to really work on.

00:17:05.259 --> 00:17:10.579
We need to really put forth the effort to start applying Bible principles

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:18.180
to put Jehovah first in our life so that we can bring our marriage back into union with Jehovah.

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:21.940
I realized that it wasn't what I wanted.

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:27.750
It was what Jehovah wanted.

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:29.069
There was just no other choice.

00:17:29.069 --> 00:17:34.750
But Jehovah wasn't going to bless us unless we got back together.

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:38.950
When we got back together, our marriage was still a work in progress.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:43.509
You can't have a perfect marriage in this world, but you can sure make it better when

00:17:43.509 --> 00:17:45.029
you put Jehovah first.

00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:47.269
We enjoyed feelings towards each other.

00:17:47.269 --> 00:17:51.369
I felt closer to Debi.

00:17:51.369 --> 00:17:54.369
Debi and I have been married now 48 years.

00:17:54.369 --> 00:17:58.450
Separation does not make anything better at all.

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:03.250
If you even have an inkling of love for one another, you want to work on that and you

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:07.450
want to make it bloom so that Jehovah can bless it.

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:09.490
The blessings have been endless.

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:13.650
Our children are all doing fantastic in the truth.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:24.450
Jehovah said taste and see that it is good, so we've got to do that.

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:32.170
We really appreciated this couple sharing, the experience with the brotherhood.

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:40.089
He learned, you know, they're always arguing and it's all they did was argue, argue, argue.

00:18:40.089 --> 00:18:43.210
It affected their children.

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:47.250
They decided to separate, finally have peace.

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:51.849
I don't have to be around her or I don't have to be around him.

00:18:51.849 --> 00:19:00.329
Then he realized his relationship with Jehovah was being interfered with here and he went

00:19:00.329 --> 00:19:01.849
to the elders.

00:19:01.849 --> 00:19:04.569
His prayers were affected, things he noticed.

00:19:04.569 --> 00:19:11.049
He was honest about that and our precious sister was so nice to honestly explain.

00:19:11.049 --> 00:19:15.849
She said, what she learned was, this is not about me.

00:19:15.849 --> 00:19:17.690
It's about Jehovah.

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:24.410
Well, you finally come to that realization, Jehovah will strengthen you to enjoy peace with

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:28.529
your marriage partner.

00:19:28.609 --> 00:19:39.210
The next one, I never tire of speaking about this particular couple of verses or reading

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:42.769
about it or hearing another brother give the talk about it.

00:19:42.769 --> 00:19:47.569
See, here's what's coming soon, that's here with me, the first testimonies, chapter

00:19:47.569 --> 00:19:55.930
five and many of you are going, oh yeah, I know what he's going to read about.

00:19:56.009 --> 00:20:02.569
This is one of the prophecies that is yet to be fulfilled.

00:20:02.569 --> 00:20:08.609
So it's just invigorating to know that soon, here's what's going to happen.

00:20:08.609 --> 00:20:14.900
First, that's alone in chapter five, verse two and three.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:23.140
For you yourselves know very well that Jehovah's Day is coming exactly as a thief in the

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.140
night.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:33.900
Whenever it is that they are saying peace and security, then sudden destruction is to

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:42.940
be instantly on them just like birth pains on a pregnant woman and they will by no means

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:43.940
escape.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:52.779
Yes, Jehovah's Day, this has to do with the day, you don't break the Great Tribulation

00:20:52.779 --> 00:21:00.099
Babel on the Great is destroyed and then Armageddon finishes it off in this context, that's

00:21:00.099 --> 00:21:10.019
Jehovah's Day and what happens before that is this proclamation, peace and security, well

00:21:10.019 --> 00:21:16.059
religious leaders being involved with the part of Satan system, that's very possible, we'll

00:21:16.059 --> 00:21:22.059
have to wait and see, will it be one announcement or a series of announcements that we don't

00:21:22.059 --> 00:21:29.700
know, but this is coming and those that are staying close to Jehovah and enjoying the

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:38.339
peace from him and his son Jesus will not be deceived by this imitation proclamation

00:21:38.339 --> 00:21:48.980
of peace, imitation peace and again, back in Matthew chapter four, we're going to see

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:56.539
how Jesus handled this type of test from the devil and we learn from it here in verses

00:21:56.539 --> 00:22:04.869
eight through eleven, Matthew chapter four, again the devil took him and verse eight, took

00:22:04.869 --> 00:22:10.430
him along to an unusually high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:20.109
and their glory and he said to him, all these things I will give you if you fall down

00:22:20.109 --> 00:22:29.549
and do an act of worship to me, then Jesus said to him without hesitation, go away Satan

00:22:29.549 --> 00:22:35.950
for it is written, it is Jehovah your God you must worship and it is to him alone you

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:45.589
must render sacred service, then the devil left him and look angels came and began to minister

00:22:45.589 --> 00:22:55.670
to him see right away third time it is written Jesus was having nothing to do with this offer

00:22:55.670 --> 00:23:03.630
of the kingdoms, this imitation peace you'll have all the glory and rule and it's always

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:12.710
boggle to my mind that this one who knew Jesus and his prehuman existence would have the

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:25.029
audacity to try to get him to bow down worship him shows you he's obviously insane now he

00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:30.750
wouldn't allow either when they tried to make him an earthly king Jesus wasn't having any part

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:39.390
of that they were thinking he can bring him peace but Jesus there's no peace except by Jehovah's

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:48.349
way and the peace from God's kingdom is so superior to anything they could try to come up with their

00:23:48.349 --> 00:24:01.700
imitation peace here's why think about this Jesus will remove the devil Jesus will remove human

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:14.099
rulership Jesus will remove sin so the earth's peace will never again be disturbed and I

00:24:14.099 --> 00:24:22.019
appreciate very much that he's gonna get rid of all problems and that includes undoing all causes of

00:24:22.019 --> 00:24:33.700
pain and not just physical pain emotional pain as well wonderful to look forward to that time

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:42.579
with that beautiful peace from our precious father Jehovah and his son Jesus now in the following video

00:24:43.539 --> 00:24:55.750
see what convinced the sister not to believe the world's promises of peace my father

00:24:55.750 --> 00:25:04.119
always taught me that we need a God in our life in order for there to be peace and he always wanted to

00:25:04.119 --> 00:25:13.880
know can Christians go to war how is this consistent with the gospel of Jesus Christ but the pastor

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:20.680
could never give us an answer and so I thought I'd have to look to politics to find it a lot of

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:28.869
peace movements were being formed at that time so I joined one of them we decided where the protest

00:25:28.869 --> 00:25:39.349
marches would be which pamphlets we would use but after the protests were over everyone was so

00:25:39.349 --> 00:25:47.509
excited and they all started applauding and cheering for the leaders I thought that's not what I

00:25:47.509 --> 00:25:55.750
wanted I don't want to honor people I want to have world peace and that still hasn't happened yet

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:08.500
then I started to feel very alone and it made me feel unsafe in this world with no peace inside

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:16.170
I thought what is the purpose of life while visiting friends for coffee I saw a man I'd never

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:28.250
met before my friends told me he wanted to talk to us about the Bible so I asked him sir what do you

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:35.690
think can Christians join the military and the man said no that's not allowed because the Bible

00:26:35.849 --> 00:26:44.380
says you should love your enemy it made me think about what my father always said that when he

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:53.430
God to bring peace then a really nice lady came to my door and she had an orange book in her hand

00:26:55.029 --> 00:27:07.720
and it said true peace and security after reading it I thought this is it this is the organization

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:15.180
that truly wants peace so I went to those involved in the peace movement

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:22.220
I told them that I believe that God will change this world into a beautiful earth where they'll be

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:31.369
true peace they all looked at me like I had lost my mind I was so happy with my new life I felt

00:27:31.369 --> 00:27:36.329
like I was part of a family who truly cared about one another and really wanted peace with each

00:27:36.329 --> 00:27:50.410
other Isaiah 14 verse 7 had a major impact on my life because there God promises a calm and peaceful

00:27:51.210 --> 00:28:07.430
well wasn't that nice how she she learned she she looked to politics and protest for a world peace

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:17.910
obviously she was sincere but she'd learn that's all imitation peace true peace and security comes from

00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:22.309
Jehovah God so

00:28:22.309 --> 00:28:29.589
wrapping it up with these three different types of imitation peace that we've emphasized

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:39.829
we want to encourage you in these last minutes to safeguard the peace that Jesus has given you

00:28:41.829 --> 00:28:54.230
in John chapter 14 you know this but want you to really focus on a particular point in verse 6

00:28:56.890 --> 00:29:07.130
Jesus said to him I am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the Father except through

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:20.619
me in that beautiful particularly want to emphasize Jesus is the truth we can trust all of his promises

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:28.859
he is the truth he's going to give his peace already has and to a greater extent

00:29:30.059 --> 00:29:37.819
in the future yes our master is the truth and he gave the early Christians that peace

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:44.700
the things that they were able to deal with is his mind-boggling we read Apostle Paul's experiences

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:52.380
Peters and others the persecution they endured and they did it the enduring with joy

00:29:53.740 --> 00:30:01.579
it's amazing they can only be a supernatural provision of peace and just to remember

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:11.259
Jesus will likewise give you the peace you need now to keep doing Jehovah's will and to make him happy

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:26.059
so brothers please safeguard the gift of peace that Jesus has given you now Satan uses this world to

00:30:26.059 --> 00:30:35.900
offer you promises of imitation peace do not be misled now rather let the peace of the Christ

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:46.700
rule in your hearts and show yourselves thankful yes through his son Jehovah bless us all with peace forever
