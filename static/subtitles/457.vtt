00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:06.389
So be transformed by making your mind over.

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:10.390
What really is involved with this process?

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.390
But when we analyze this verse in Romans 12 verse 2,

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.390
perhaps there are four things initially that we need to remember.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.390
First of all, to whom was Paul riding under inspiration?

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.390
Well, he was riding to Christians who were anointed,

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.390
who were faithful, and yet he used an imperative form,

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.390
saying, be transformed.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.390
He didn't say, you were already transformed.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.390
So that's an interesting point for us,

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.390
because when we read these words,

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.390
it's not just a matter of us remembering what happened to us in the past

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.390
when we became Christians,

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.390
but it's something that we need to focus on now.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.390
And that's highlighted by the second point

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.390
that in the original language, the verbs used here,

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.390
indicate a continual process,

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.390
not just something that happens once,

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.390
and that's it.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.390
And the third point, that it indicates a complete change.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.390
Now, many of us remember that the Greek word here

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.390
involves a complete change.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.390
Metamorphosis is the word that comes from that,

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.390
and that reminds us of a caterpillar changing into a butterfly.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.390
Now, by this we're not inferring,

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.390
we all have to become butterflies,

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.390
but the point highlighted is a complete change

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.390
from something that is one form to another.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.390
So in a similar way,

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.390
with regard to our personalities,

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.390
this is not just a superficial change,

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.390
as if we were changing our clothing,

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.390
but rather a deep-down change that involves our personalities.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.390
So we change from one person to another.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.390
Of course, this takes time,

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.390
and that's the fourth point we need to keep in mind.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.390
It's a gradual process.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.390
Not always is it completely just progressing in a positive sense,

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.389
sometimes for many of us,

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.389
we make some progress,

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:13.389
and then slip back a little,

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:15.389
and then we make some further progress.

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:18.389
But the main thing is that we're making progress.

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:22.389
Yes, this is not just something that you do one time,

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:24.389
and that's it forever.

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:26.389
That's highlighted by an experience

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:30.389
in the Watchtower back in 1977

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:34.389
of a brother Harry Yoshikawa from Hawaii.

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:38.389
He was a very large Japanese brother.

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:40.389
But before coming to the truth,

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:42.389
he was a street brawler,

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:44.389
and in fact the article his life experience

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:48.389
said from street brawler to Christian minister.

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:52.389
Now Harry was trained in the martial arts.

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:54.389
He was trained in boxing,

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.389
and he just enjoyed fighting other persons.

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:59.389
But after serving in the military for a while,

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.389
eventually he came in contact with the truth,

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:04.389
and he started to make changes.

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:07.389
And his life story perhaps helps us to realize

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.389
what's involved with these changes.

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:14.389
So of course he stopped drinking, he stopped fighting.

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:16.389
But Harry goes on to tell us about the first day

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:18.389
that he went witnessing.

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.389
He was in a market area,

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:22.389
holding up the awake magazine,

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:24.389
and he was calling out,

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.389
read the awake.

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:28.389
Well, all of a sudden,

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.389
some smart person said to him,

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:33.389
I'm wide awake,

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.389
so I don't need that trashy magazine.

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.389
Well, Harry says at that point,

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:41.389
his old personality returned to him.

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.389
He yelled out,

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.389
you're wide awake, huh?

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.389
Well, you won't be for long,

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.389
you'll be sleeping shortly.

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:55.389
So Harry took a blow at this man,

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:57.389
who promptly ran,

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.389
and Harry chased him for two blocks.

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.389
Now the other brother who was with Harry,

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:05.389
chased after him.

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:08.389
And fortunately, the first man was a fast runner.

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:11.389
And when the other brother caught up with Harry,

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:12.389
he said, Harry,

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.389
what would you have done if you caught the man?

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:16.389
And he said, I would have beat him up.

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.389
And the brother tried to reason with Harry.

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.389
Well, just imagine what a reproach

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.389
this would be on Jehovah's name.

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.389
I mean, if the police came,

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.389
and Harry said, no, I wouldn't tell him I was a witness,

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:32.600
I'd say, I was a Pentecostal.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.600
Well, Harry hadn't quite made that complete change.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.600
But later, you see in this picture,

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.600
as it appeared in the watchtower,

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.600
here's Harry working with his wife,

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.600
doing something that many Asian men

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.600
would find very hard to do,

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.600
helping her in the kitchen.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.600
And for many years, Harry and his wife

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.600
served very faithfully in the circuit work.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.600
And the change was so different

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.600
that many of the brothers and sisters

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.600
who heard the story about Harry,

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.600
who was called, by the way, tiny the bruiser,

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.600
didn't believe really that he was such a violent man previously.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.600
So what do we learn from this?

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.600
That this transformation process

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.600
may involve some drastic changes in the beginning

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.600
that outwardly appeared to make someone different,

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.600
but gradually over the years,

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.600
we have to continue on making these changes,

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.600
transforming our thinking and our desires.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.600
Now, why is that such a challenge?

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.600
Well, we know, first of all,

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.600
we have a tendency to do what's wrong

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.600
because we're sinful.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.600
There are all sorts of wrong attitudes

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.600
and thoughts that are perhaps lying dormant

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.600
in our personalities.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.600
It could be a matter of prejudice.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.600
It could be a racial viewpoint hatred,

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.600
pride, greed.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.600
And these things we could liken to weeds in a garden.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.600
Any of us that have done gardening

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.600
realize that just because you took the weeds out one time

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.600
doesn't mean to say that's a one-time effort, does it?

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.600
They tend to grow back.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.600
So we constantly need to be on the watch

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.600
to make sure that these weed-like tendencies

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.600
or traits that we may have don't grow back.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.600
And of course, the other thing is,

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.600
we're surrounded by Satan and his world.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.600
And Satan's world is always trying to influence us.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.600
Let's take our Bibles and turn together, please,

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.600
to the book of Ephesians.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.600
Ephesians chapter 4 and verse 18.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.600
And notice here how it describes Satan's world.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.600
It's the opposite to what we should be doing.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.600
It says, they are in darkness mentally

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.600
and alienated from their life that belongs to God

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.600
because of the ignorance that is in them,

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.600
because of the insensitivity or the dulling of their hearts.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.600
So Satan is trying to muddy the waters, we might say,

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.600
trying to get us mentally to be dull,

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.600
to not be receptive to God's Word.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.600
So that's why we need to continue to be transformed

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.600
by making our mind over.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.600
But how can we do that?

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.600
Well, we're not going to discuss at depth

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.600
the physical explanation with regard to neurons

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.600
and synapses this is early in the morning for that.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.600
But we do need to understand a little bit of how the mind works.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.600
You see, basically, we can say that when we have new thoughts

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.600
or new concepts that come into our mind,

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.600
it's as if symbolically there are little pathways

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.600
that are formed in our mind.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.600
And the more that we think about certain things,

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.600
the more solid we might say or more permanent,

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.600
these pathways become.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.600
So maybe we could illustrate it this way.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.600
You see, as we're starting to learn new things,

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.600
it's as if we're going through the jungle.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.600
And as we're cutting our way through the jungle,

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.600
at first it becomes very difficult.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.600
Perhaps we could say it's like learning a new language.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.600
We all know if we try to do that.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.600
At first it becomes very, very difficult.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.600
It's like cutting your way through a jungle path.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.600
Or if you're trying to learn something new like driving an automobile,

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.600
it could seem very difficult.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.600
But what do we realize?

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.600
The more often you do something,

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.600
then what happens, these symbolic pathways in our minds

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.600
become easier to walk along.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.600
On the other hand, of course,

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.600
if we do something once,

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.600
but we don't continue to do it,

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.600
what happens?

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.600
It's as if the jungle grows back

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.600
and it becomes difficult to do things again.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.600
So what's the point for us to get from this?

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.600
Well, in our personal study, our meditation,

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.600
and when we try to apply the things that we learn,

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.600
we shouldn't always look for new things.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.600
You see, sometimes we might say, well,

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.600
I've read that publication already.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.600
I don't need to reread it.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.600
Yes, you do.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.600
Why?

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.600
Because just because you cut a path in your mind through the jungle,

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:30.600
doesn't mean to say that that path is always going to remain easy to pass through.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.600
No?

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:37.600
It's good for us to go back again and go over and over the same things.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.600
And what happens?

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:43.600
That symbolic pathway in our minds becomes easier for us to go along

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:50.600
and we can truly say that we have been transformed by making our mind over.
