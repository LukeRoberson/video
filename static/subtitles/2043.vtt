00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.720
In the video to follow, you will find it to be of great interest to take a close look

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.240
at Jehovah's creation.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.559
Although you will be amazed by the magnitude and intricacy of the physical world around

00:00:16.559 --> 00:00:21.039
us, look beyond the awesome material universe.

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.640
See the qualities and personality of our grand creator.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.440
This will draw you closer to Him.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.399
Is this difficult to do?

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:33.079
Not really.

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.399
But it does require that we make a conscious effort to contemplate Jehovah's marvelous creative

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.399
works.

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:45.679
Now, we warmly invite you to draw closer to your loving Heavenly Father as you observe

00:00:45.679 --> 00:01:16.180
intently some of the wonders of His creation.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:24.310
Hey, he's a fast little guy, huh?

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.310
Let's go check this out.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:35.969
You know, there's a lot of amazing things to see out here.

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:38.769
But you can't see them all with your eyes.

00:01:38.769 --> 00:01:39.769
What do you mean?

00:01:39.769 --> 00:01:44.500
Remember, our family study.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.180
You wanted to know how you could really be God's friend.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.180
Really get to know him, remember?

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.180
Yeah, I remember.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.180
You said by studying the Bible.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.180
That's right.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.579
And studying God's Word is the best way.

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:00.349
But there's another way.

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:02.909
Take King David, for example.

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.349
What do you think he saw when he looked at the night sky?

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:06.349
The stars?

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:07.349
That's right.

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:10.030
But he saw more than that.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.229
He saw Jehovah.

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:14.229
But how could he see Jehovah in the stars?

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.030
People can see Jehovah.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.229
David could see who he is, his personality,

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:22.349
by appreciating the things that he made.

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.949
It helped him to draw close to God.

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:28.270
You can draw close to Jehovah in the same way,

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:48.500
from looking at what he's made on Earth to the stars above.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.379
He enjoys looking at creation.

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.539
But few realize that they are catching a glimpse

00:02:55.539 --> 00:03:01.370
into the mind and heart of our grand creator.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.530
Long ago, David learned about Jehovah

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.050
through his inspired word.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:13.580
But he also saw and drew close to him through creation.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.259
When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers,

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:22.139
the moon, and the stars that you have prepared,

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.900
what is mortal man that you keep him in mind,

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.330
and the son of Earthling Man that you take care of him?

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.930
David loved Jehovah

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.530
and saw Jehovah's power, wisdom, and love

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.900
reflected all around him.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.699
The world we live in today is designed

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:47.099
to distract us from our creator.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.539
Do you take time to look beyond the man-made world?

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.819
When you do, even something seemingly common

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.539
becomes extraordinary as you open your eyes

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:03.659
to see the one who made it.

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:13.229
Life are planet, the starry heavens.

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:17.230
Looking at these will help you see Jehovah,

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.230
drawing you closer to him.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:27.180
At Genesis 155, Jehovah invited Abraham

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.180
to look up to the heavens and count the stars.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.180
How many stars could he count?

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:43.180
Our Milky Way galaxy contains over 100 billion stars.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.550
Can we even comprehend such a large number?

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.550
Let's try by comparing each star in our galaxy

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.550
to a page in a book.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.550
How long would it take to examine those pages?

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.550
At the rate of a page per second,

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.550
it would require over 3,000 years.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.550
In order to count them in your lifetime,

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.550
you would need to turn about 50 pages per second

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.550
for every moment of your life.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:21.269
We lack ability to even count the stars.

00:05:21.269 --> 00:05:25.269
Yet Jehovah knows each one by name.

00:05:25.269 --> 00:05:30.610
Looking beyond our galaxy,

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.610
astronomers are finding that sections of the sky

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.610
appearing nearly empty from Earth

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.610
are actually filled with thousands of other galaxies.

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.949
But did Jehovah scatter them randomly?

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:48.949
Even at this colossal scale,

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:53.389
elegant organization is seen.

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:56.389
There is one who is stretching out the heavens

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.389
just as a fine gauze,

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:03.389
who spreads them out like a tent in which to dwell.

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:09.389
All of these massive celestial bodies are in constant motion.

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:12.389
Their precise movements have been likened

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:15.389
to the choreography of an elaborate ballet.

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:19.660
Besides their vast numbers,

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.660
the distance between stars is also mind-boggling.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.660
Let's try to visualize the distance from our sun

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.660
to its nearest neighbor's star, Proxima Centauri.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:37.740
Imagine that we could shrink our Milky Way galaxy

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.740
so that our sun was roughly the size of a soccer ball,

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.740
located near New York City.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.740
On this scale, Proxima Centauri

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.740
would be almost 4,000 miles away in Paris, France,

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.740
a little smaller than a golf ball.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:03.850
Really, the sun is almost 25 trillion miles away

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:09.410
from its nearest neighbor's star.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.410
We only have to look at the stars

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:14.410
to be filled with awe for Jehovah.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.410
Yet, as the book of Job describes,

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:22.410
what we see are only the fringes of his ways.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:27.300
When the prophet Isaiah looked at the stars,

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.300
he perceived Jehovah's qualities.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.300
Raise your eyes high up and see

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.300
who has created these things.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.300
It is the one who is bringing forth the army of them

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.300
even by number,

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:48.300
all of whom he calls, even by name.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:52.300
Due to the abundance of dynamic energy,

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.300
he also being vigorous in power,

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:59.639
not one of them is missing.

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:01.639
And how much power was necessary

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:08.060
in the creation of this universe?

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.060
There is incredible power found even

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.060
at the atomic level of matter,

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.060
but man has often used it destructively.

00:08:18.339 --> 00:08:21.339
In contrast, as a potter with clay,

00:08:21.339 --> 00:08:24.339
Jehovah skillfully used his dynamic energy

00:08:24.339 --> 00:08:27.339
to make all the matter of the universe.

00:08:27.339 --> 00:08:33.169
The heavens are declaring the glory of God

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:36.169
and up the work of his hands,

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:40.919
the expanse is telling.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:42.919
In modern times,

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:49.480
we have peered into the far reaches of space

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:53.480
and seen creation at an awe-inspiring scale.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:59.100
Yours, O Jehovah,

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:03.100
are the greatness and the excellency.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:07.100
Everything in the heavens is yours.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.100
In your hand,

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:15.980
there are power and mightiness.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:19.980
When we raise our eyes to the heavens,

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:24.980
we are seeing evidence of Jehovah's unparalleled power.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:38.320
Jehovah is powerful,

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.320
but do you really think he cares about each of us here?

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.320
He shows that he cares

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.320
and how he designed a comfortable home

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.320
made just right for us.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:55.090
Think about outer space and how barren it is.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:58.090
Yet the earth hits an oasis.

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:00.090
Remember what Isaiah said,

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.090
the former of the earth and the maker of it,

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:05.090
who did not create it simply for nothing,

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:09.090
who formed it even to be inhabited.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:12.090
But how did Jehovah form the earth

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:16.870
to be inhabited?

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:19.870
More abundant than any other substance on earth,

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:23.870
water is often taken for granted.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:26.870
Yet it is fundamental to life

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:31.700
by looking closer at water.

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:38.259
What can we learn about the one who designed it?

00:10:38.259 --> 00:10:44.259
A single glass of water contains countless trillions of molecules.

00:10:44.259 --> 00:10:48.259
Each molecule has a deceptively simple design,

00:10:48.259 --> 00:10:53.259
two atoms of hydrogen attached to one atom of oxygen.

00:10:53.259 --> 00:10:56.259
The oxygen side has a slightly negative charge,

00:10:56.259 --> 00:11:01.259
and the hydrogen a slightly positive charge.

00:11:01.259 --> 00:11:05.259
These opposite charges attract each other like tiny magnets,

00:11:05.259 --> 00:11:10.259
forming what are called hydrogen bonds.

00:11:10.259 --> 00:11:14.259
What results from this simple yet elegant design?

00:11:14.259 --> 00:11:21.460
As water gets colder, it contracts and grows more dense.

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.460
However, unlike most liquids,

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.460
as its temperature approaches the freezing point,

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:30.460
something unexpected happens.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:34.460
Water begins to expand.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.460
As it freezes into ice,

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:40.460
the hydrogen bonds between water molecules lock into place,

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:44.460
crystallizing into a very open lattice.

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.460
Due to this unique design,

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.460
ice is less dense than liquid water,

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:53.379
and floats on top.

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:57.379
This quality prevents much of the water in lakes, rivers,

00:11:57.379 --> 00:12:01.379
and even the oceans from eventually becoming solid ice.

00:12:01.379 --> 00:12:06.629
Instead, Jehovah created a natural insulator

00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:10.629
that preserves life in the liquid water beneath.

00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:16.259
Really, Jehovah's wisdom is seen

00:12:16.259 --> 00:12:19.259
in how he masterfully designed the sea,

00:12:19.259 --> 00:12:25.840
and fountains of waters.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.840
This abundance of water could not exist

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:32.840
if Earth were not precisely placed within our solar system,

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:38.120
some 93 million miles away from the Sun.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:43.120
Had the Earth been situated only 5% closer to the Sun,

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:48.850
scorching heat would have made life impossible.

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:52.850
If the Earth were placed only 1% farther from the Sun,

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:55.850
freezing temperatures would have covered much of the globe

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:57.850
with huge sheets of ice.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:04.669
Jehovah also made the Earth just the right size.

00:13:04.669 --> 00:13:06.669
If Earth were slightly larger,

00:13:06.669 --> 00:13:09.669
its gravity would be stronger.

00:13:09.669 --> 00:13:12.669
Hydrogen, a light gas, would collect,

00:13:12.669 --> 00:13:15.669
being unable to escape the Earth's fall.

00:13:15.669 --> 00:13:20.669
In time, the atmosphere would be inhospitable to life.

00:13:20.669 --> 00:13:26.460
On the other hand, if our Earth were slightly smaller,

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:30.460
life sustaining oxygen and surface water would escape.

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:35.779
In either case, were the Earth larger or smaller,

00:13:35.779 --> 00:13:38.779
life would not exist.

00:13:38.779 --> 00:13:45.139
Both its size and proximity to the Sun

00:13:45.139 --> 00:13:48.139
revealed that Jehovah formed the Earth,

00:13:48.139 --> 00:13:50.139
even to be inhabited.

00:13:50.139 --> 00:13:54.440
Orbiting around our planet,

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.440
we have a faithful witness

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.440
that Jehovah purposefully designed our home.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:04.230
Is the Moon merely an object of beauty

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.230
made to adorn the sky?

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:10.669
The psalmist states that Jehovah made the Moon

00:14:10.669 --> 00:14:13.669
for appointed times.

00:14:13.669 --> 00:14:16.669
What purpose does it serve?

00:14:16.669 --> 00:14:21.269
With a diameter one-quarter that of the Earth,

00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:26.269
the Moon exerts a strong gravitational force on our planet,

00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:30.269
stabilizing the tilt of the Earth's axis of rotation.

00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:33.269
Without the Moon,

00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:36.269
the Earth would wobble over long periods of time

00:14:36.269 --> 00:14:39.269
from nearly zero to 85 degrees.

00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:43.269
This would have an extreme effect on our climate.

00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:46.269
On part of the Earth, temperatures would soar.

00:14:46.269 --> 00:14:50.269
While elsewhere, they would plummet.

00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:56.789
Keeping our climate and seasons consistent,

00:14:56.789 --> 00:15:02.789
our Moon is at once beautiful and essential to life.

00:15:02.789 --> 00:15:08.490
It is fitting that the Bible calls our Moon

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:12.490
a faithful witness in the skies.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:17.860
When you hear the gentle sounds of water,

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:23.299
when you feel the warmth of the Sun,

00:15:23.299 --> 00:15:27.299
when you gaze up at the beautiful Moon,

00:15:27.299 --> 00:15:32.250
give thanks to Jehovah,

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:36.250
the one who lovingly prepared our earthly home.

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:45.139
But what draws us even closer to Jehovah

00:15:45.139 --> 00:15:49.139
in a personal way is life itself

00:15:49.139 --> 00:15:53.139
and how he designed us to enjoy it.

00:15:53.139 --> 00:15:56.139
Michael, look how much fun they're having.

00:15:56.139 --> 00:16:03.559
We're not robots.

00:16:03.559 --> 00:16:06.559
Jehovah has given us the ability to love

00:16:06.559 --> 00:16:09.559
and form satisfying relationships.

00:16:09.559 --> 00:16:13.639
To laugh and play,

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:18.879
we can appreciate beautiful music,

00:16:18.879 --> 00:16:26.519
see and vivid colors,

00:16:26.519 --> 00:16:30.519
smell and taste an almost infinite variety.

00:16:30.519 --> 00:16:33.519
These things aren't necessary for life,

00:16:33.519 --> 00:16:36.519
but they add to our enjoyment.

00:16:36.519 --> 00:16:39.519
And what would life be like without these wonderful things?

00:16:39.519 --> 00:16:52.820
What if there was no music?

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:59.269
What if there was no emotion?

00:16:59.269 --> 00:17:01.269
What if every food, even though nutritious,

00:17:01.269 --> 00:17:07.970
had the same color, texture, taste and smell?

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:18.349
That would be boring.

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:20.349
We could still survive,

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:24.980
but would we enjoy life in the same way?

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:28.980
Jehovah has made life absolutely wonderful here on earth.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:33.359
No wonder we want to live forever.

00:17:33.359 --> 00:17:36.359
Remember what King Solomon said?

00:17:36.359 --> 00:17:42.059
He has put time and definite into our hearts.

00:17:42.059 --> 00:17:44.059
That's the way Jehovah made it.

00:17:44.059 --> 00:17:52.240
The more we observe creation,

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:56.240
the more we appreciate that life is a gift

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.240
meant to be enjoyed.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.240
Jehovah has given us so many things that fill us with happiness.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.240
Remember last year's vacation?

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.240
Yeah.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.240
What did you like about it?

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.240
Like the hiking,

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.240
beach,

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.240
sunsets,

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.240
love of food,

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.240
and I like watching the animals.

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.240
Yeah, we really savor the simple things in creation.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.240
Jehovah made us with the ability to enjoy life.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:26.240
And we see his creativity in the incredible variety of life on earth.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:33.579
The variety we see in the animal kingdom is breathtaking.

00:18:33.579 --> 00:18:56.900
Oceans alone,

00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:00.900
we find moving things without number.

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.900
Living creatures,

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.900
small as well as great.

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:16.190
The waters are teeming with life.

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:20.190
Jehovah's many and varied works are wonderful.

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:47.160
In addition to variety,

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:53.160
the instinctive behaviors that we see attest to Jehovah's wisdom,

00:19:53.160 --> 00:20:00.369
how do birds find their way as they migrate thousands of miles?

00:20:00.369 --> 00:20:05.369
How do they know that flying in a V-formation can serve energy?

00:20:05.369 --> 00:20:09.650
How does a beaver know how to build a dam?

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:13.650
And what materials to use?

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:19.650
Who teaches a spider how to measure out the geometric patterns of its web?

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:32.000
What makes the diversity and behaviors we see in nature?

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.920
All the more wondrous is their source.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:42.920
Jehovah carefully concealed within each living cell a special type of molecule

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:48.920
called deoxyribonucleic acid, commonly known as DNA.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:57.490
Each DNA molecule is composed of a series of smaller molecules called nucleotides,

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:02.490
cytosine, guanine, adenine, and thymine.

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:09.490
These nucleotides are linked in long strands twisted into a double helix.

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:14.490
Just as individual letters can be arranged to make up different words,

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:19.490
these four nucleotides, C, G, A, and T,

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:25.490
are arranged in specific combinations to identify amino acids.

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:34.930
In turn, these amino acids are the fundamental components of all living things.

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:41.930
Incredibly, whether a majestic redwood or an exotic orchid,

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:47.930
a giant whale, or a newborn baby,

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:53.930
the design for every living organism is recorded in the same format,

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:56.930
a personal DNA blueprint.

00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:02.210
Appropriately, the psalmist said,

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:05.210
How many your works are, O Jehovah?

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:09.210
All of them in wisdom you have made.

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:12.210
The earth is full of your productions.

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:21.680
But nowhere is Jehovah's wisdom and love more evident than in his creation of humans.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:31.279
From its very beginning, human life has potential far beyond that of any other creation on earth.

00:22:31.279 --> 00:22:35.279
You kept me screened off in the belly of my mother.

00:22:35.279 --> 00:22:40.279
My bones were not hidden from you when I was made in secret,

00:22:40.279 --> 00:22:44.279
when I was woven in the lowest parts of the earth.

00:22:44.279 --> 00:22:48.279
Your eyes saw even the embryo of me.

00:22:48.279 --> 00:22:52.279
And in your book, all its parts were down in writing.

00:22:52.279 --> 00:23:01.420
What makes us so unique of all of Jehovah's earthly creations?

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.420
How are we different?

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:10.819
Genesis 126 states that Jehovah went on to say,

00:23:10.819 --> 00:23:15.819
Let us make man in our image according to our likeness.

00:23:16.819 --> 00:23:24.700
We have been designed to reflect the personality of Jehovah himself,

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:33.609
our ability to reason, our inborn spiritual need,

00:23:33.609 --> 00:23:36.609
our capacity for love.

00:23:36.609 --> 00:23:45.130
All separate us from God's animal creation.

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:52.130
Further, in designing us, Jehovah gave us the potential to go on living forever.

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:57.130
Our selves, the tiny building blocks that make up our body,

00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:02.380
are designed to continually regenerate.

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:06.380
Jehovah also provided us with a masterpiece of design,

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:10.380
made to last us forever.

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:15.380
Our brain contains some 100 billion neurons.

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:21.380
Each neuron is a special nerve cell with connections to thousands of other neurons,

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:26.380
some with as many as 250,000 others.

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:32.380
Collectively, they store the information that makes us who we are.

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:48.500
Amazingly, our creative capacity and potential for learning is limitless.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:53.500
Observing life draws us closer to Jehovah.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.500
He designed us to learn forever,

00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:00.500
to enjoy life around us forever.

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:08.099
And this makes us look forward to living forever.

00:25:08.099 --> 00:25:19.730
Out of love, Jehovah promises a life that we can only dream of.

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:26.039
Jehovah will cleanse the earth and restore the paradise.

00:25:26.039 --> 00:25:38.859
In this new world, we will appreciate animal creation like never before.

00:25:38.859 --> 00:25:46.069
We can only imagine how rich the real life will be.

00:25:46.069 --> 00:25:51.069
As we grow to perfection, we will go on learning about life,

00:25:51.069 --> 00:25:55.069
our beautiful home, and Jehovah.

00:25:55.069 --> 00:26:01.710
Love.

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:03.710
Peace.

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:10.500
And happiness will fill our hearts.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.500
Although the paradise is yet future,

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:21.500
taking time to discover Jehovah's creation will add purpose and meaning to your life right now.

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:34.309
In vain, many have searched for purpose and meaning through careers, money, and entertainment.

00:26:34.309 --> 00:26:39.309
Man's world is designed to draw us away from Jehovah.

00:26:39.309 --> 00:26:44.819
Whether it does so or not is up to us.

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:50.930
If you want to draw closer to Jehovah,

00:26:50.930 --> 00:27:00.579
open your eyes to the world around you and see the one who made it all.

00:27:00.579 --> 00:27:04.579
After contemplating creation, Job said,

00:27:04.579 --> 00:27:07.579
In hearsay, I have heard about you,

00:27:07.579 --> 00:27:10.579
but now my own eye does see you.

00:27:10.579 --> 00:27:16.150
We can see Jehovah everywhere.

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:20.430
In the majestic heavens above,

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:24.430
in the precious home he made for us.

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:30.539
In how he designed life itself,

00:27:30.539 --> 00:27:35.539
every living thing on our beautiful earth, no matter how small,

00:27:35.539 --> 00:27:39.539
reflects the extraordinary creative skill,

00:27:39.539 --> 00:27:50.420
originality, and wisdom of our loving creator.

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:54.420
Even as we enjoy life forever,

00:27:54.420 --> 00:28:00.420
we will never stop being odd and amazed by our wonderful father,

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:05.420
the grand artist of creation, Jehovah.

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:32.410
After viewing this video,

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:36.410
surely we appreciate why glorious creatures in the invisible heavens

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:38.410
felt impelled to declare,

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:41.410
you are worthy, Jehovah, even our God,

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:45.410
to receive the glory and the honor and the power

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:48.410
because you created all things.

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:52.410
And because of your will, they existed and were created.

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:57.230
Creation's wonders should move you to have feelings

00:28:57.230 --> 00:29:00.230
such as expressed at Psalm 19, in verse 1,

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:02.230
which says,

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:05.230
The heavens are declaring the glory of God.

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:10.230
And of the work of his hands, the expanse is telling.

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:15.230
And at Psalm 104, verse 24, the Psalmist exclaims,

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:18.230
How many of your works are, Jehovah?

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:21.230
All of them in wisdom you have made.

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:27.250
The earth is full of your productions.

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:32.250
How much of God's creation do you notice each day?

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:34.250
If you have children,

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:37.250
do you help them to see Jehovah's infinite wisdom

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:39.250
and the depths of his love for us

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:46.190
by drawing their attention to the things he has made?

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:49.190
When Jehovah created the first man at him,

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:52.190
he put him in a beautiful paradise garden.

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:56.190
One of Adam's first assignments was to carefully observe

00:29:56.190 --> 00:30:01.190
the animal creation and study their characteristics.

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:04.190
Then he gave each a name.

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:07.190
Would you have enjoyed that assignment?

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:10.190
No doubt in that paradise it would have been easy

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:13.190
to become absorbed with the works of Jehovah's hands

00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:17.190
and then be moved to glorify the Creator.

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:22.819
Today's situation, however, is dreadfully different.

00:30:22.819 --> 00:30:24.819
There is no paradise.

00:30:24.819 --> 00:30:26.819
There are no sinless humans.

00:30:26.819 --> 00:30:29.819
Selfish humans are ruining the wonderful home

00:30:29.819 --> 00:30:31.819
given to humankind.

00:30:31.819 --> 00:30:34.819
More and more people live in cities,

00:30:34.819 --> 00:30:36.819
where the physical elements of heaven and earth

00:30:36.819 --> 00:30:41.819
often go unnoticed and are not fully appreciated.

00:30:41.819 --> 00:30:44.819
So many are preoccupied with the imagery

00:30:44.819 --> 00:30:49.819
and fantasies of television, movies, and video games.

00:30:50.819 --> 00:30:53.819
We must resist the trend in today's world

00:30:53.819 --> 00:30:58.299
to ignore the works of Jehovah's hand.

00:30:58.299 --> 00:31:01.299
When comforting the poor people of his day,

00:31:01.299 --> 00:31:05.299
Jesus told them to observe intently the birds of heaven

00:31:05.299 --> 00:31:09.299
and to take a lesson from the lilies of the field.

00:31:09.299 --> 00:31:12.299
Why did he use this approach?

00:31:12.299 --> 00:31:14.299
His encouragement to draw lessons

00:31:14.299 --> 00:31:16.299
from Jehovah's wondrous creation

00:31:16.299 --> 00:31:18.299
would add depth to their faith.

00:31:18.299 --> 00:31:21.299
It would instill confidence in the Creator

00:31:21.299 --> 00:31:23.299
and build appreciation for His wisdom,

00:31:23.299 --> 00:31:26.299
saving power, and love.

00:31:26.299 --> 00:31:29.539
To cultivate such godly qualities,

00:31:29.539 --> 00:31:32.539
we do well to read the Bible daily

00:31:32.539 --> 00:31:36.539
and attend Christian meetings regularly.

00:31:36.539 --> 00:31:38.539
And you parents,

00:31:38.539 --> 00:31:41.539
having a weekly Bible study with your children

00:31:41.539 --> 00:31:44.539
will help them to cultivate a profound appreciation

00:31:44.539 --> 00:31:47.539
for our maker's wondrous works.

00:31:47.539 --> 00:31:50.539
It is wise not to be unduly distracted

00:31:50.539 --> 00:31:52.539
by the works of this world.

00:31:52.539 --> 00:31:54.539
Neither should we become totally absorbed

00:31:54.539 --> 00:31:58.539
in personal pursuits or selfish interests.

00:31:58.539 --> 00:32:00.539
Make the time and effort

00:32:00.539 --> 00:32:04.539
to observe intently all the wonderful works of God's creation.

00:32:04.539 --> 00:32:08.539
Doing so will draw you ever closer to Jehovah,

00:32:08.539 --> 00:32:13.539
the one who made everything beautiful in its time.
