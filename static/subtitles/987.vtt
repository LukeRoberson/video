00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.280
Family peace is precious.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.879
It's even as the Bible proverb says,

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:10.580
better is a piece of dry bread where there is peace

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.880
than a house full of feasting along with quarreling.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.980
But what exactly is family peace?

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.480
Someone might say,

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.179
as long as we're not arguing, our family's at peace.

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:25.879
But is that real peace?

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:28.579
We might think of two countries that were fighting

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.379
but have now agreed to a ceasefire.

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:34.780
Does the ceasefire mean that they've become real friends

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.780
who love one another?

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.979
No.

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:41.880
We know that genuine peace takes more work.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.479
That's true in the family as well.

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:47.679
Our Heavenly Father knows that the most satisfying

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:52.280
family peace involves more than an absence of arguing.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.479
It involves a family's well-being and unity.

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:02.979
Is such peace in a family today really possible?

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.280
Although none of us have a perfect family,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.379
the answer is yes.

00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:09.079
While it requires work,

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:11.879
perhaps breaking bad habits that disrupt peace

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:14.379
and adopting new ones that promote it,

00:01:14.379 --> 00:01:17.879
those efforts are worth it.

00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:19.780
In this symposium,

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.879
we'll see how Bible principles can guide families to peace

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.980
just as a road map guides travelers

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.480
to a beautiful destination.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.879
In each of the talks,

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:33.680
we invite you husbands,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.480
fathers, wives, mothers, children, teenagers

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.280
to be the traveler who studies the map

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.780
and then goes in the right direction.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.379
The focus of our first talk is showing love and respect.

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:53.480
Why would you say these two qualities

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.780
are so important to family peace?

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.480
Well, it's simple.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.879
Because family members who love and respect one another

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:04.780
feel secure and appreciated.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.780
As a result,

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.280
our relationships are warm, close, and peaceful.

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:12.080
Of course,

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.979
showing love and respect can be a challenge these days.

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:22.319
In the following dramatization, notice why.

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.479
Irene.

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:28.979
You look so handsome.

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:31.479
Oh, you look beautiful.

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:34.479
Those came out so nice.

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:37.860
Look at you.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.550
Look at you.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:41.550
Look at you.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.550
You're so so nice.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.550
Sorry, Olivia.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.550
Are you okay?

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.550
Yeah, it's okay, Sue.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.550
I'm so sorry, boys.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.550
Um, I'm all I did.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.550
That was the last box.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.900
Dad, are there some wedding photos?

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.900
Let me see.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:59.900
Look at this.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.900
Oh, you're so beautiful.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.500
Olivia?

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.939
I know this is all new, baby.

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:31.939
Be patient.

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:43.090
Can I cut in?

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.090
Yeah, sure.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.849
Thanks.

00:03:46.849 --> 00:04:10.159
What's wrong?

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:11.159
Where's the desk?

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:13.159
We have to get rid of it.

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:15.159
This one's better for everyone.

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:18.160
You mean it's better for him?

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.160
For Max?

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.160
What are you saying?

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.160
What do you care?

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.160
Don't talk to me like that.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.160
Get back here.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:56.300
Hey, Olivia.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.300
What do you think about the desk?

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.300
Come here, sweetie.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.300
Come here.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:13.300
So you never forget that I love you.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.300
I hope you like it.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:25.509
Today, every family faces challenges of some sort.

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:28.509
So let's consult our roadmap together.

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:31.509
In the Bible at Romans 12 and verse 10.

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:33.509
Would you read it with me, please?

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:36.509
That's Romans 12 and verse 10.

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:42.509
In brotherly love, have tender affection for one another.

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:47.509
In showing honor to one another, take the lead.

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:49.509
Now, what's the point?

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:52.509
Regardless of the role we play in the family,

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:55.509
each of us needs to treat our family members

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:57.509
with love and respect.

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:01.509
We need to take the lead or initiative to do so.

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:05.509
To help us, let's consider four good habits

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:08.509
that all of us should work to develop more fully.

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:10.509
Habit number one.

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:14.509
Regularly express tender affection.

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:18.509
When conveyed with sincerity, expressions of affection

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:21.509
are like sunshine and water to plants.

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:25.509
They help everyone in the family grow and thrive.

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:27.509
In the video we just watched,

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:30.509
did you note how Olivia cherished her father's gift,

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:33.509
that green desk, and his tender words?

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:38.509
He told her, so you never forget that I love you.

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:42.509
We also saw warm affection as the newly blended family

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:45.509
of Max and Irene looked at wedding photos.

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:47.509
That was encouraging.

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:49.509
Well, here's a question.

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:54.509
How are we doing an expressing tender affection in our family?

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:57.509
If that's not one of our strengths,

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:00.509
we might relate to a husband who mustered up the courage

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:02.509
to say I love you to his wife.

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:05.509
It brought her to tears, tears of joy,

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:07.509
and she said this,

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:09.509
I love you too,

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:14.509
but this is the first time in 25 years you've said it like that.

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:16.509
Well, what's the point?

00:07:16.509 --> 00:07:19.509
We don't want to wait that long, of course.

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:22.509
But even an awkward attempt at expressing affection

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:25.509
in our family is an act of love,

00:07:25.509 --> 00:07:28.509
and it can do so much good.

00:07:28.509 --> 00:07:31.509
That's a habit we all want to cultivate.

00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:33.509
Let's consider a second habit.

00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:39.509
Be kind in your actions, tone of voice, and choice of words.

00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:43.509
In the video, we recall Irene's reassurance to her daughter, Olivia.

00:07:43.509 --> 00:07:48.509
She said, I know this is all new, baby. Be patient.

00:07:49.509 --> 00:07:54.509
Mom was kind in what she said and how she said it.

00:07:54.509 --> 00:07:57.509
A little later though, Olivia was upset.

00:07:57.509 --> 00:07:59.509
While we know she was hurt,

00:07:59.509 --> 00:08:03.509
her speech and actions were not so kind, were they?

00:08:03.509 --> 00:08:05.509
During the pandemic,

00:08:05.509 --> 00:08:08.509
all of us have been under tremendous stress,

00:08:08.509 --> 00:08:11.509
and likely we didn't always treat others

00:08:11.509 --> 00:08:14.509
in our family as kindly as we would have liked.

00:08:14.509 --> 00:08:16.509
Well, that's in the past.

00:08:16.509 --> 00:08:18.509
What can we all do now?

00:08:18.509 --> 00:08:24.509
We can pray to Jehovah to help us take the lead in showing kindness.

00:08:24.509 --> 00:08:28.509
For example, every day greeting one another kindly.

00:08:28.509 --> 00:08:31.509
Every day saying, please, and thank you,

00:08:31.509 --> 00:08:35.509
sharing little gifts, making time to talk, really listening.

00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:38.509
All of these are acts of kindness.

00:08:38.509 --> 00:08:42.509
That's a good habit we all want to cultivate.

00:08:42.509 --> 00:08:44.509
What's habit number three?

00:08:44.509 --> 00:08:49.509
Be quick to apologize and forgive freely.

00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:53.509
In the video, Olivia's new step-sister Sue apologized

00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:57.509
after she bumped into Olivia with a box by mistake.

00:08:57.509 --> 00:09:00.509
That apology promoted peace.

00:09:00.509 --> 00:09:03.509
When you and I realize we've hurt someone,

00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:06.509
even unintentionally, what should we do?

00:09:06.509 --> 00:09:09.509
We should make amends quickly.

00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:11.509
A mother named Marina said this.

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:14.509
We try to set a good example for our children

00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:17.509
in forgiving others and not getting offended.

00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:21.509
When I am wrong, I apologize to my children.

00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:26.509
I want them to learn to do the same in their dealings with others.

00:09:26.509 --> 00:09:29.509
That's a good habit, wouldn't you agree?

00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:32.509
Well, let's consider one more, a fourth habit.

00:09:32.509 --> 00:09:37.509
Help your family members feel respected.

00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:41.509
An article in the Awake magazine once made this insightful comment.

00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:46.509
Respect is in the eye of the beholder.

00:09:46.509 --> 00:09:48.509
What does that mean?

00:09:48.509 --> 00:09:51.509
Even if we think we're showing respect in the family,

00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:54.509
a good question to ask ourselves is,

00:09:54.509 --> 00:09:58.509
do my family members feel that I respect them?

00:09:58.509 --> 00:10:02.509
Is there more I can do to help my mate, my children, or my parents?

00:10:02.509 --> 00:10:06.509
Feel loved and respected.

00:10:06.509 --> 00:10:10.509
Brothers and sisters, when we fulfill our God-given role in the family

00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:13.509
by developing good habits such as these,

00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:18.509
we show respect both for Jehovah and all of our family members.

00:10:18.509 --> 00:10:22.509
Now, let's think about Olivia and her mom.

00:10:22.509 --> 00:10:25.509
In the next video, note how peace can be restored

00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:28.509
by showing love and respect.

00:10:28.509 --> 00:10:41.460
It's okay, Mom.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.460
You didn't know.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:49.820
Dad did that for her just before he died.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.820
Anything I can do to help.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:59.909
Romans 1210.

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:02.909
And showing honor to one another.

00:11:02.909 --> 00:11:12.620
Take the lead.

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:17.470
Olivia?

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:23.379
I made your favorite tonight.

00:11:23.379 --> 00:11:24.379
Thank you.

00:11:24.379 --> 00:11:37.059
I wanted to tell you I didn't handle that so well today.

00:11:37.059 --> 00:11:43.830
You had good reason to be upset about the desk.

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.830
Mom, you didn't know.

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:51.820
It's just one of those things that Dad did just for me.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:12:01.590
I know he's my sub-dad now, but I just wish he would have checked first.

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:03.590
It wasn't Max.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:05.590
It was me.

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:14.909
I wanted to surprise Max with a place for him to do his work.

00:12:14.909 --> 00:12:17.909
So he didn't make you get rid of the desk?

00:12:17.909 --> 00:12:22.909
No.

00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:25.909
I just thought you both didn't care.

00:12:25.909 --> 00:12:29.909
I will never, ever stop caring about you.

00:12:30.909 --> 00:12:49.019
What a beautiful outcome.

00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:53.019
The well-being and unity of the family were restored.

00:12:53.019 --> 00:12:57.019
The mom Irene applied the principal at Romans 1210.

00:12:57.019 --> 00:13:02.019
She took the lead or the initiative to talk kindly with her daughter.

00:13:02.019 --> 00:13:06.019
Though Olivia was upset, she too showed love and respect

00:13:06.019 --> 00:13:09.019
by being willing to listen to her mom.

00:13:09.019 --> 00:13:12.019
As a result, the misunderstanding was cleared up

00:13:12.019 --> 00:13:17.019
and Irene used the opportunity to reassure her precious daughter of her love,

00:13:17.019 --> 00:13:22.019
saying, I will never, ever stop caring about you.

00:13:22.019 --> 00:13:28.019
And how our hearts were touched to see their warm embrace.

00:13:28.019 --> 00:13:32.019
When we take the lead in applying Bible principles,

00:13:32.019 --> 00:13:36.019
we promote genuine family peace.

00:13:36.019 --> 00:13:40.019
So may all of us be determined to keep showing our family

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:46.019
that we truly love and respect them in word and action.

00:13:46.019 --> 00:13:49.019
Now, please listen as Brother Robert Lucioni,

00:13:49.019 --> 00:13:51.019
a helper to the publishing committee,

00:13:51.019 --> 00:13:55.019
considers the next talk of this symposium with the theme,

00:13:55.019 --> 00:14:00.019
follow the roadmap to family peace, improve communication.
