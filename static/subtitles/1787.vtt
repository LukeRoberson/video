00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.240
From our video archives, we have comments from brother Theodore

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.720
Jaros, who served as a member of the governing body before he died and received

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:18.000
his heavenly reward. Young ones, this illustrates that weathering test of faith as a

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.800
young person can mold us for a long life of faithful service. Brother Jaros

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:32.560
recounts what he had to face as a young man.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:39.679
During World War II, I was pioneering. When we go back to that period of time, it

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:45.960
was a different era. Many times individuals would even threaten you. They were

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.399
going to run you out of the community or out of the neighborhood and sometimes

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:58.240
even resort to other threats. And I have some vivid recollections of what it

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:04.480
was like. I was a young man at the time. It was a joy to be out in the ministry

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.879
that you had to be very equipped to be ready to give an answer of the hope that

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:14.920
it was as in you and to uphold the position that a Christian should take in such

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.519
turbulent times. The organization published a very fine article that was very

00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:27.719
timely on the subject of neutrality. And that appeared in the November 1st 1939

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:34.040
issue of the watchtower. It defined what neutrality meant. When it comes to being

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.840
in support of some cause, we were 100% in support of the kingdom. We were

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.560
representing God's kingdom as God's ambassadors or employees here upon the

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.640
earth. And so we could not engage in any of the world's controversies or share

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.400
in their war efforts because we were not taking sides. The convention in

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:02.879
St. Louis was held during the period of the war. The convention program

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:10.599
impressed upon my mind the need for keeping integrity. And in doing that we would

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:16.240
be upholding Jehovah's sovereignty. When it came time for recruiting young

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.199
men and we had to register for the draft, why the brothers already knew what

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:28.240
their position would be. But since the World War II was raging, here in this

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.159
country, especially there was a lot of patriotic fervor, and the attitude of

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:38.199
people was that if you weren't in the army as a young man and you were either

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:45.560
considered to be unfit or else you were a draft dodger. And so when we went out

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:53.039
in the field ministry, many times people would abuse you verbally, especially if

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:57.680
they were opposed. There was some provision in the United States Selective

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.919
Service Act that allowed for ministers to be exempted. But for the most part,

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:09.080
only pioneers and some who may have had appointed positions in the

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.479
congregation were given recognition as ministers. That was rare. But most

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:20.439
of the brothers had to go to prison and they were prepared for this. They knew

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:28.439
what was in store and they made a firm stand for Jehovah's Righteous Cause. And

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:33.080
I enjoyed preaching but I was prepared to do like many of the other brothers

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.479
were ready to do and that was to go to prison if we had to suffer for

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:43.599
righteousness sake. There's a group we were on popular and there was a lot of

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:51.599
publicity given to mob violence or beatings or perhaps other things that

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:55.719
people were not in agreement with as far as Jehovah's Witnesses are concerned.

00:03:55.719 --> 00:04:00.360
On the other hand, there were many honest hearted people who really listened to

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.240
the Kingdom message. We found a lot of sheep like ones and they were sympathetic to

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.800
us. They had a love for the Bible. We had many home Bible studies that were

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:16.000
being conducted at that time. We will always refer to the precedent that we

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.759
have in the position that Jesus Christ took when he was before pilot and Roman

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:27.439
official. And as Jesus pointed out, His Kingdom was no part of this world. And

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:32.439
since we represent God's Kingdom, we're sort of aliens in this world representing

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:38.079
that government. And so as a result, that's where our legions belonged. So that

00:04:38.079 --> 00:04:41.680
does not mean that we're seditionist or that we're opposed to human

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.480
governments. It simply means that we're neutral. This helped to strengthen the

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:54.040
brothers because when they saw others holding fast to the truth, maintaining

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.600
their integrity. And that was a challenge in those turbulent days that

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:05.720
steal them for opposition that they had to face. So rather than frightening

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.360
our brothers, as the Apostle Paul pointed out, we should not be frightened by

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.439
our opponents, our brothers were really filled with a greater measure of

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:19.399
Jehovah spirit, which enabled them to be bold and also to be fearless in

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:27.980
declaring the truth. If we take our stand firmly on Jehovah's side and support

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:35.500
that side, then we're going to succeed in accomplishing what he wants us to do.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.819
He's backing us not. And as Jesus promised, he would be with us down to the

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:46.339
conclusion of the sister of things. We experienced that. As the prophets

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:52.379
echo, I wrote, it's not by human might or power, but by my spirit. It would be

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:58.180
impossible for humans to do what Jehovah accomplished. We have to get him full

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:04.620
credit for things that have transpired. And it's a marvel in our eyes when we look

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:10.699
back to see how he did. We were simply instruments in his hand. And he maneuvered

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:15.860
us, he guided us by his spirit, and we tried to be responsive to the way that

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.579
spirit led us.
