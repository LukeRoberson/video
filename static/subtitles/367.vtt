00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.710
David's prayer teaches us an important lesson, especially since we know that David

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.750
enjoyed Jehovah's favor.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:17.710
And the key point is it was his attitude in willingness he sacrificed to God.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.870
His motive was good, it was from the heart.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.629
And when we studied David's life, we realized that it was a constant.

00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:29.629
Even when he sinned, it still was a constant that he would approach Jehovah with an open

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:33.229
heart, willingly sacrificing to him.

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:40.789
Let's read Psalm 546, the entire verse, Psalm 546.

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:45.789
It starts out as we have already considered, I will sacrifice to you willingly.

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:53.590
But then it says, I will praise your name, O Jehovah, for it is good.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.670
More directly said, really, it's Jehovah is good.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.469
His name is good, but he is good.

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.590
And everything he requires of us is good.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.109
There's no command from God for his servants that is bad.

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:12.189
It's always for our benefit.

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:17.829
Even the elimination of the wicked really is good because it shows love for those who

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:23.189
just want to live in peace and worship their great God, enjoy and happiness.

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.790
So that's also something that's very good what he's going to do.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.590
So why wouldn't we want to offer sacrifices to our great God, willingly?

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.310
And as we know, Jehovah looks at more than what we offer to him or what we give up for

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.549
him.

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.790
In each case, it's sacrifice.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.709
He can see why we're making sacrifices to him.

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:52.349
And this is undoubtedly one of the reasons why Jehovah rejected Keynes' sacrifice.

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:55.030
It wasn't just because it was a vegetable.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.189
But the Scripture says he didn't look with approval on Cain and his sacrifice.

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.510
But on Cain, because Cain evidently had a bad attitude.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:12.189
There was something wrong in his motive and why he was offering sacrifices to Jehovah.

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:15.069
And this ties in with what Amos wrote about the Jews in his day.

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.669
If you'd like to look up the Scripture, it's Amos chapter 5.

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:24.900
And we're going to read verses 21 through 24.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.460
This chapter 5 verses 21 through 24 to see what Jehovah's feelings were about sacrifices

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.740
that the Jews were making during the time of Amos.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:42.099
Verse 21, I hate, I despise your festivals.

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.340
And I take no pleasure in the aroma of your solemn assemblies, perhaps incense, whatever

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.379
it may have been.

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:54.860
Then he says in verse 22, even if you offer me whole burnt offerings and gift offerings,

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:58.300
I will find no pleasure in them.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:05.219
And I will not look with favor on your communion sacrifices of fattened animals.

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:09.099
So what we learn here is that it's not what was offered to God.

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.979
The great God of the universe doesn't need some dead animal on an altar.

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:17.180
It has more to do with the attitude of people under worship of Jehovah.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.180
Why they were honoring him or doing these things.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.460
And then what's interesting is the way verse 23 expresses the feelings of Jehovah,

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.580
he says, spare me the din of your songs.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.060
And let me not hear the melodies of your stringed instruments.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.860
And then after that he tells us what he wants, let justice flow down like waters.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.699
Well, that has to do with the people and their attitude and their service to God and

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:48.060
righteousness, righteousness, like an ever-flowing stream.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.259
The din of your songs and the music, you know, the word din means loud.

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:55.060
And it was apparently loud.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.860
The music that they played, the din of their songs, their musical instruments.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.259
And the watchtower made an interesting comment on this.

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:09.300
Today, Christendom has a number of celebrations where they use music.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.379
And there's the din of their songs.

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:15.340
They blend pagan customs with the name of Jesus.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.500
Every honor God and what you think of almost immediately is Christmas time.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.980
The din of the music and all the big stores everywhere in the owners of the stores most

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:32.620
likely are either non-believers, atheists or perhaps Jewish or some other background

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.699
that they have no concern for the Lord Jesus or honoring the mighty God.

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.660
It's all commercial.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.540
And so it makes us think of those things.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:48.939
An interesting item also about sacrifice in the first century was published in the watchtower

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:53.540
of February the 1st, 2014, and this is the point it made.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.899
God's law stated that all the sacrifices offered at the temple were to be of the best quality

00:04:57.899 --> 00:04:59.699
possible.

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:07.699
According to the first century, CE, Jewish writer Philo, he stated that priests at that time

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:12.740
scrutinized animals from head to foot to ensure that they were sound in all respects and

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.420
without spot or defect of any kind.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.819
So before they went into the temple or they sold it, the animal had to be sound.

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:24.660
Now this is what scholar EP Sanders has to say about it.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:30.019
He states that possibly the temple officials authorized reliable sellers of sacrificial

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:37.339
victims to sell only animals and birds that priests had previously inspected.

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:43.980
In this case, the seller would have to give the buyer some kind of chit or token.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:50.660
A guarantee indicating that the victim, the sacrifice sold, was unblemished.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.459
And then the article goes on to say the following.

00:05:53.459 --> 00:06:01.899
In 2011, archaeologists found just such a chit or token in the vicinity of the temple.

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:09.860
A coin-sized clay seal dating from between the first century BCE and 70 CE, so it covered

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.620
the period of time when Jesus walked the earth.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:20.139
It says it's too word-aramaic inscription has been rendered pure for God.

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:25.180
And it's thought that temple officials would have attached such tokens to products for

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:31.060
rich will use or to animals intended for sacrifice.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.579
That's pretty interesting.

00:06:33.579 --> 00:06:37.819
Hebrews 1315 says that we make sacrifices, doesn't it?

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:41.300
Praise from the lips, sacrifices to Jehovah God.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:50.899
So what might be our chit or token that says that our sacrifices are pure for God?

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:56.060
Well I'm not aware that the chit has any anti-type, so I'm not going to go into that.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:01.139
But we're thankful that we do not have to get a chit or a token every time we put

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:08.060
a few hours in service, work at a construction site, make a return visitor conduct a Bible

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.540
study.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:14.980
And remember, no, your chit is not your field service report at the end of the month.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:15.980
Not at all.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.779
Isn't it wonderful?

00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:24.500
No human has been appointed to scrutinize our sacrifices and determine whether or not

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:31.339
we merit a chit of approval stating that our sacrifice was pure to God.

00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:35.579
We just keep doing what David did willingly.

00:07:35.579 --> 00:07:39.620
We give of ourselves to honor our great God, Jehovah.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:45.540
And we acquire a good conscience that if properly trained in harmony with the scriptures,

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:51.019
in a sense, it might be considered the chit in that we feel comfortable because of a

00:07:51.019 --> 00:07:54.540
good conscience and knowing that we're giving Jehovah God our best.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:08:00.019
Not worried about some quota in itself, feeling that that justifies us or makes us wholly

00:08:00.019 --> 00:08:05.100
or honorable, no, just always giving Jehovah God our best.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:10.620
And the watchtower of December 15, 2013, said the following.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:19.420
When we live up to Bible standards, our sacrifices bring much joy and satisfaction to us.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:23.660
And they are especially acceptable to Jehovah.
