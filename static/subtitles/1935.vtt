WEBVTT

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:13.919
Dinner's almost ready. Please tell Shem, we'll be right there, Mom.

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:17.920
Well, Abram, before we go in, let me tell you the rest.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.920
I was just a young man back then.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.769
After Jehovah gave my father the command to build the ark,

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.269
it took decades to complete.

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:35.950
Then we had to gather food and all the animals.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:42.880
We had no idea how long we would be inside.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.380
But when Jehovah closed the ark's door,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.200
we were ready.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.200
So were you scared?

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.700
Abram, I know you're just a boy,

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.200
but things have happened to you, they've scared you, right?

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.200
I was older than you, but I was still scared.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.200
When we were building the ark, people thought we were crazy.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:48.480
And then, just like Jehovah said it would, it happened.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.980
Only eight were saved.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.980
My parents, my brothers, and our wives.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.980
We are living proof that Jehovah's word never fails.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.980
Jehovah promised my father that he would never again

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.980
destroy all life of a global flood.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.979
I want you to know I was scared, but I know to trust Jehovah.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.979
When Jehovah promises something that we've never seen,

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:15.979
it takes a special quality to believe it.

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:18.979
Do you know what that quality is?

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:19.979
Feast.

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:43.460
Abram and Sarah lived in earth,

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.460
a city full of people who worshiped pagan gods.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.060
But like Noah and Shem,

00:02:51.060 --> 00:03:07.659
Abram and Sarah worshiped Jehovah.

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.659
Abram, go out from your land,

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:14.659
and from your relatives,

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:54.759
and come into the land that I will show you.

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:58.199
Where will we live?

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:00.199
We'll be so far away from our family.

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:03.199
I have every confidence that if we do,

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:06.199
a Jehovah asks that things will turn out fine.

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:10.960
Well, whatever it is,

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.960
I will be by your side.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.959
There is nothing I would even sacrifice for Jehovah.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:18.959
I know.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:28.100
Abram and Sarah left earth.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.100
They lived in hay ran for some time.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.639
But Jehovah told Abram to keep moving.

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.639
Living in tents was not easy.

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.639
But the caravan gradually settled into a routine of travel.

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:53.230
Abram's nephew Lot was like a brother to him.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.149
But as their flocks grew large,

00:04:57.149 --> 00:05:00.149
tension grew between their groups.

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:09.589
Please, there should be no quarreling between me and you

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:11.589
for we are brothers.

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:14.589
It is not the whole land available to you.

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:17.589
Please separate from me.

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:19.589
If you go to the left,

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:22.589
then I will go to the right.

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:25.589
Though it must have hurt their hearts,

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:27.589
they agreed to part ways.

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:33.600
Lot moved east to the district of the Jordan.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.600
Where the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were located.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.550
After Lot had gone,

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.550
Jehovah made a promise about Abram's future.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.629
Raise your eyes, please,

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:52.629
and look from the place where you are.

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:54.629
To the north and south.

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:57.629
East and west.

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:00.629
Because all the land that you see,

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:05.629
I will give to you and your offspring as a lasting possession.

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:10.629
And I will make your offspring like the dust particles of the earth.

00:06:10.629 --> 00:07:01.079
Abram, do not fear Abram.

00:07:01.079 --> 00:07:03.079
I am a shield for you.

00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:07.079
Your reward will be very great.

00:07:08.079 --> 00:07:10.079
Sauron Lord Jehovah,

00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:12.079
what will you give me,

00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:15.079
saying that I continue childless?

00:07:15.079 --> 00:07:16.079
Go outside.

00:07:16.079 --> 00:07:18.079
Look up.

00:07:18.079 --> 00:07:19.079
Please,

00:07:19.079 --> 00:07:23.079
to the heavens and count the stars.

00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:25.079
If you are able to do so,

00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:31.060
so your offspring will become.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.360
Later,

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.360
Jehovah changed Abram's name to Abraham,

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.360
which means father of a multitude.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.360
He also changed Sarah's name to Sarah,

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.360
which means princess.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.360
Every day,

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.360
these new names would remind them of Jehovah's promise.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:02.160
And Jehovah didn't stop there.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.540
He sent three angels to reassure Abraham

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:12.189
with even more good news.

00:08:12.189 --> 00:08:14.189
Within the year,

00:08:14.189 --> 00:08:16.189
he and Sarah would have a son,

00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:28.600
but they also brought other news.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.600
Through one of the angels,

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.600
Jehovah said,

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.600
The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is indeed great,

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.600
and their sin is very heavy.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:57.669
Will you really sweep away the righteous with the wicked?

00:08:57.669 --> 00:09:00.669
Suppose there are fifty righteous men within the city.

00:09:00.669 --> 00:09:03.669
Will you then sweep them away?

00:09:03.669 --> 00:09:06.669
And not pardon the place for the sake of the fifty righteous

00:09:06.669 --> 00:09:07.669
who are inside it?

00:09:07.669 --> 00:09:11.980
It's unthinkable of you.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.980
Will the judge of all the earth not do it as right?

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:21.029
If I find Sodom fifty righteous men in the city,

00:09:21.029 --> 00:09:25.029
I will pardon the whole place for their sake.

00:09:25.029 --> 00:09:27.029
Please hear I presume to speak to Jehovah

00:09:27.029 --> 00:09:29.029
whereas I am dust and ashes.

00:09:29.029 --> 00:09:34.659
Suppose a fifty righteous should lack five.

00:09:34.659 --> 00:09:38.659
Because the five will you destroy the whole city?

00:09:38.659 --> 00:09:43.659
Abraham knew that the judge of all the earth always does what is right,

00:09:43.659 --> 00:09:47.659
but knowing and trusting are two different things.

00:09:47.659 --> 00:09:50.659
I will not destroy it for the sake of the twenty.

00:09:50.659 --> 00:09:53.659
Jehovah, please do not become hot with anger,

00:09:53.659 --> 00:09:55.659
but let me speak just once more.

00:09:55.659 --> 00:10:01.600
Suppose only ten are found there.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:14.200
I will not destroy it for the sake of the ten.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.200
I have seen in my life that everything that Jehovah promises

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.200
always comes true.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.200
Throughout your life,

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:28.200
have full confidence Jehovah will always do what is right.
