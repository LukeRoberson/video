00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.540
Have you ever felt that a change of oversight or organizational arrangement was hard to accept?

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:11.339
Or maybe you even felt hurt in some way personally by the change?

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.899
Well, why do these changes occur? And what is the best way for us to respond to them?

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.379
Even if the change seems to be to our personal disadvantage?

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.620
Well, let's open our Bibles to Numbers chapter 27 and examine an account

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.260
that may help answer these questions.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.659
The account relates to when Jehovah notified Moses of his approaching death

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.820
and the need for a man to take over Moses' responsibilities.

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:46.539
And Numbers chapter 27, let's begin at verse 15.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.859
Then Moses said to Jehovah, let Jehovah the God of the Spirit of all people

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.740
appoint over the assembly a man.

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:04.939
Who will go out and come in before them and who will lead them out and bring them in

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:10.620
so that Jehovah's assembly may not become like sheep that have no shepherd.

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:19.340
Why would Moses call Jehovah describe him as the God of the Spirit of all people?

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.859
Because all people are dependent on Jehovah for life.

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.540
Moses knew that and Moses knows that when one servant dies,

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:38.459
Jehovah the God of the Spirit of all people will raise up another living servant

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:43.579
to serve within the theocratic structure just as Jehovah sees fit.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.019
So what does Jehovah now do? Well, let's look at verse 18.

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.700
So Jehovah said to Moses, take Joshua, the son of none, a man whom there is Spirit

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.420
and lay her hand on him.

00:02:02.019 --> 00:02:06.260
So now Jehovah picks Joshua. Joshua was a spiritual man.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.020
He proved his loyalty and obedience for years.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.500
However, Joshua was not to be a Moses junior.

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.939
The arrangement was changing and it would not be a one-man show.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.780
Joshua would now fit into a new organizational role.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.659
What would that be? Well, let's look at verse 19 and 20.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:42.020
Then stand him, Joshua, before Elijah the priest and before all the assembly and you must

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:50.900
commission him before their eyes. You are to confer some of your authority on him. Notice

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:57.780
not all the authority but some so that all the assembly and the Israelites may listen to him.

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.340
So here we see the difference in this role becoming clear.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.020
Joshua was not to be like Moses and knowing Jehovah face to face.

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:13.699
Not all of Moses' authority was to transfer over to Joshua.

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:18.180
Only what was needed for Joshua to have the respect of the nation.

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.620
And now notice verse 21.

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:30.979
He will stand before Elijah the priest who will inquire in his behalf by the judgment of the

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:39.539
Eurom before Jehovah. Do we see the difference? Joshua was now to work with the high priest

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:47.379
to ascertain the divine will. Yes, Joshua was capable but he was more than capable in God

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:54.259
fearing. Joshua was a modest man and a humble man and he accepted this new arrangement.

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:04.770
Well, Joshua had already been molded on the great potter's wheel for some 40 years of wilderness

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:10.370
wandering. A discipline that he personally did not deserve.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.689
But now in accepting this new arrangement, this molding process would continue.

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:24.529
How would it continue? Well, we see Jehovah now using two imperfect men, an administrator

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:31.329
and a high priest to balance each other out to make sure that Jehovah's perfect will took place.

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:38.769
So now in two imperfect people, making sure Jehovah's perfect will moved forward.

00:04:38.769 --> 00:04:45.810
This would be the arrangement. For example, during the time period of the kings when King

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:52.529
Uzziah circumvented the theocratic arrangement, it was high priest Aziraya who

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:59.730
reproved him for this unlawful act. Or when high priest Abayathar proved his loyal,

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:05.970
it was King Solomon who dismissed him from the priesthood. So we see the balance of two

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:12.930
imperfect men when one was weak, the other proved strong. Well, what do we learn?

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:19.009
Well, we're learning that Jehovah, again, the God of the Spirit of all people

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:25.569
is not dependent on just one person, nor is he dependent in our case at Bethel on just one

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:34.129
department. And that is why we work together. And this is why we foster warm feelings in relationships

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:42.529
between departments because we need each other. So each of us needs to be humble enough to ask for

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:49.329
help when needed and yet on selfish enough to provide resources so that others can get

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:58.529
Jehovah's work done. And we see evidence. We see evidence today of how Jehovah is getting his

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:04.769
work done. Look at what he is accomplishing. Jehovah is continuing to raise up qualified

00:06:04.769 --> 00:06:13.410
servants again to shepherd and lead his people as he sees fit. When it comes to world headquarter

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:19.490
departments oversight or branch committee members department overseers construction overseers

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:28.850
these individuals are like Joshua who are willing to work together and to stay on the potter's

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:39.329
wheel and be molded by Jehovah. Why? So that we do not become, as verse 17 says, as sheep that have

00:06:39.329 --> 00:06:47.730
no shepherd. But in reality, all of us, whether we are in positions of oversight or not, want

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:54.850
Jehovah the great potter to mold us. Keep molding us. And yet, frankly, it can be challenging,

00:06:55.569 --> 00:07:02.529
challenging at times to stay on the potter's wheel and not allow the imperfections of others

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:11.810
to push us off or the organizational changes that take place to knock us down. For example,

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:21.490
as Jehovah continues to refine his organization adjustments are made and perhaps in the process

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:28.449
our assignment is change and our feelings get hurt by the change or perhaps our feelings get hurt

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:36.129
by the way the change was implemented. So when you feel that you've been caught in a pinch

00:07:36.129 --> 00:07:43.889
point between the moving parts of the organization or more specifically when you feel pressure being

00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:52.050
applied upon you as you spin on the wheel of the great potter, that is when we beg Jehovah,

00:07:52.850 --> 00:08:01.170
beg Jehovah to help us remain moist, beg Jehovah to help us remain pliable during this molding

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:09.170
process. And tell Jehovah, Jehovah, it's not easy. Tell him how you feel. Please help me, Jehovah.

00:08:09.649 --> 00:08:16.850
I want to be molded by you. And then we're patient. Be patient and try to see the big picture.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:22.769
What is the big picture? The big picture is that Jehovah is using imperfect people to work with

00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:30.930
imperfect people. That's all he has at present. And that Jehovah is teaching us, he is teaching us

00:08:31.569 --> 00:08:39.090
how to make peace with imperfection. The big picture is how much Jehovah is accomplishing

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:46.129
with so little. When we meditate on that, we can see the value of working together and when we

00:08:46.129 --> 00:08:56.529
work together, that's when Jehovah accomplishes the most. So it's a fact, the personnel and God's

00:08:57.169 --> 00:09:05.009
visible organization change and it will continue to change whether that be due to death or other

00:09:05.009 --> 00:09:13.570
circumstances, the personnel will change. And yet the change does not cripple the work. Why?

00:09:14.289 --> 00:09:22.529
Because this is Jehovah's work, it's not man's. So let's be confident that Jehovah, again, Jehovah,

00:09:22.529 --> 00:09:33.490
the God of the Spirit of all people, he will continue to raise up humble, imperfect yes, but humble,

00:09:34.129 --> 00:09:43.490
imperfect overseers to shepherd his people as he sees fit. And rest assured that Jehovah will continue

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:57.409
to guide and lead his organization, his global organization, to spiritual success.
