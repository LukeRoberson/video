00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:26.609
I close my eyes and I can't see a world of peace, love, and harmony come with me and you'll see

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:46.039
You will see it's not a dream as I'm sure you know peace, things got promised so long ago we'll guarantee

00:00:46.039 --> 00:01:10.299
Sure to be, you will see this joy and laughter in every sound and see

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:17.299
This is the way our God meant it to be

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:32.040
And those who fell asleep along they live again we see them every day come with you'll see

00:01:32.040 --> 00:02:18.699
You will see it's gone forever now it's history come with me and you'll see

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:35.219
You will see it's joy and laughter in every sound and see

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:49.340
This is the way it meant it to be

00:02:49.340 --> 00:03:00.020
This world is enough for me eyes of faith that's free as we see

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:25.550
What's in store is normal, flows your eyes and comes peace and heart
