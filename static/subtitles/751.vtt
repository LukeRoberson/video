WEBVTT

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:08.419
Well, at this time, we have a regular and much-loved feature of the program that will enjoy the inside story.

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:16.579
Please pay close attention to this as it's presented by Brother James Cawthon, one of our Kiliot school instructors.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.089
Life is often compared to music. It has high notes as well as some low notes, isn't that true?

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.850
But together they compose a melody that is unique to ourselves.

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:31.649
Where does that melody go?

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:35.649
For faithful worshipers, it goes directly to Johova's heart.

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:42.609
You see, greatly values, not just the accomplishments in our lives, but the journey itself.

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:48.049
So today, we're going to hear from three students in our Gilly Class of 151.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.289
As you listen to the journey, can you hear their song?

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.689
Let's get started. I'm sure you'll enjoy meeting our first guest, Joel and Adrian Grimm,

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.969
on this edition of the Inside Story.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.310
Adrian, your Theocregul started at a very early age. Can you tell us about that?

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:45.870
Yes, my parents had helped me to know that I wanted to serve Johova early.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.629
And then when I was around 11, there were five young single pioneer sisters that all

00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:55.629
moved into my congregation as need graders. So, of course, they were my heroes.

00:01:56.269 --> 00:02:00.349
And one of them knew some American Sign Language, and she started conducting Bible studies

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:04.670
and interpreting the meeting for the deaf in the area. And she started teaching me a little

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.229
bit too. I was trying to help out. Is that you there at 11 years of age?

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.509
That's me and my little brother. I think about that time, yeah.

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:18.590
So, a few years later, when I was a teenager, the sister had to leave the area.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.629
And so, there were the Bible cities there. So, I was trying to help out as much as I could.

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.870
But it was challenging then because there were no Sign Language publications yet.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.990
Yeah. So, how did you do that without any publications?

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.150
I tried different things. One thing is every Saturday night, you would find me sitting with the

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.430
watchtower on one knee and a Sign Language Dictionary on the other knee. And I would just look up every

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.750
word. You mean you looked up every word? Yeah, it was the best I could do at the time.

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:55.469
But I got a lot of help too because the deaf were so kind and so generous and helping me.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.310
And so patient. I remember this one time having a Sign Language conversation with a young girl

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.830
about my age in the back of the Keenam Hall. And she signed something and I couldn't understand.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.550
So, I asked her to repeat it. She repeated it, but I still wasn't getting it. And we just went back

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.710
and forth with her trying every way she could think of to try to get me to understand

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:21.870
until I just had tears going down my face. But we kept at it. And finally, I got it. And I remember

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.629
we just hugged because I finally understood. But it was that kind of patience and kindness that I

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.750
saw over and over again that just really touched my heart. Yeah. Well, that experience touches our

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:41.469
heart too. Later, you met Joel. And Joel, you were serving at Wal-Kill Bethel at the time. And

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:46.990
things worked out. Adrian, you became a Bethel bride. And then later, you both decided to join

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:54.270
the Sign Language congregation. Now, Adrian already knew ASL Sign Language, right? But Joel,

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:00.590
you had to learn it. So, how was that for you? Well, after learning Sign Language, for one thing,

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:07.229
I will never look at 1st Corinthians 9.22 the same way again. So what does 1st Corinthians 9.22

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:13.629
have to do with learning a language? Well, that's where Paul says that he became all things to people

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:20.430
of all sorts. And that's very true when you're learning a language. Language, it's more than just

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:26.350
collecting vocabulary so that you can communicate with someone. You have to get to know the way that

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:32.910
person thinks. Well, there's no doubt that language can affect the way we think. But can you give us

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.990
an example? Sure. Imagine there's two people having a conversation. And you want to get to the

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.670
other side. Now, the way I grew up, my culture, is that I need to approach them and excuse myself,

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:50.670
be acknowledged. And then I can move on. But in Sign Language, it's different. If two people are

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:56.670
having a signed conversation, they value their eye contact and the flow of their communication

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:02.910
much more than they value my idea of what's polite. So in Sign Language, you just move on straight

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:08.110
through the conversation, minimal distraction. No, we even in dance and bobbin. No, you just go

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:15.069
straight on through. No waving. No dancing. No bobbin. Just straight through. We should have

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:22.189
applied that to your assignments in class. There's probably some truth to that. So it was difficult

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:25.870
to adapt. But of course, you know, after some time, I got the hang of it. And there were other

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.629
adjustments, of course, that you have to make to culture. And I learned a valuable lesson. And

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:37.230
that is that language and culture are intrinsically linked. You can't really have one without the

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:43.870
other. And if you're learning a new language, you have to just adapt. You have to be willing to

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:49.629
to change. And the best thing to do is that if there are no scriptural principles involved,

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:55.870
just adopt the culture and the value of the native language users. And that's what Paul meant.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:02.589
He said, become all things to people of all sorts. Well, no, Dale Paul is an excellent example in

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:08.189
that regard. And it sounds like you were too. So where did your journey in sign language take

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:13.389
you next? Well, there we were at Bethel. But we really were hoping that we would get a chance

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:18.509
to go to Gilead. But we were advised that it would be a good idea to pioneer together first.

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:23.790
So we left Bethel and we moved to Tennessee and joined a sign language group down there.

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:28.990
And we really did love that group. We sure did. But we met some wonderful brothers and sisters.

00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:34.269
And we had some great experiences there in Tennessee. After a few years, the circuit

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:38.269
overseer asked us if we would be willing to move to Texas to support a sign language congregation

00:06:38.269 --> 00:06:44.670
there. And so we did. And again, just wonderful times, great brothers and sisters. But we were

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:50.029
only there about a year. And then we got invited back to Wal-Kill Bethel. So we went back to Wal-Kill.

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:55.310
And after a few more years there, the brothers called us one day and asked us if we would be

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:00.990
willing to transfer to the RTO, the remote translation office in Fort Lauderdale, Florida,

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:06.269
where they translate into American sign language. And we were there for five years. This is a picture

00:07:06.269 --> 00:07:10.910
of the residence buildings there. It looks very beautiful. So how'd you like that assignment?

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.709
I loved it. You remember, I told you that when I first started in sign language, there were no

00:07:15.709 --> 00:07:22.430
sign language publications. So then as they started coming out, we had the opportunity to see the

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:27.069
impact that those publications had on so many people's lives. So we already treasured those.

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:33.069
And then to get a chance to kind of get a glimpse behind the scenes and see how much love and

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:38.189
hard work goes into all of those translations. Really was powerful. I loved it.

00:07:38.189 --> 00:07:41.709
Mm-hmm. And so what publication are we looking at here?

00:07:41.709 --> 00:07:46.350
So this is when we were working on the very first meeting workbook. And this is when we were

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:52.110
working on the sign language version of that one. Really working in the translation department was

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:59.149
such a beautiful way to see Jehovah's love for all people. I'm sure that was excellent. And you

00:07:59.149 --> 00:08:04.589
learned good lessons there. Joel, how were you affected by supporting the sign language field?

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:11.230
Well, in many ways, but one way is definitely I learned to be more empathetic. Do you mind if I

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:16.189
share an experience that I wish to be pleased to hear it? Okay. Well, when we were in Tennessee,

00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:21.550
we had the privilege of studying with a deaf man named Fred. Now, Fred had been to many churches,

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:27.149
but he was unsatisfied. The local publishers found him in the ministry and he agreed to a Bible

00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:34.110
study and Fred loved to learn. He especially loved watching the ASL Bible, the portions of it that

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:40.110
we had available at that time. And he also loved to read the insight volumes. He just had an

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:46.029
insatiable desire for knowledge. He would show up to the meetings and he would ask us questions

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:51.870
about them. So he might come and say, okay, I have two questions about Elijah and Elizabeth.

00:08:52.509 --> 00:09:02.259
And we'd think, Oh, he's in the ease now. One day, Fred's wife told us a little story. She said

00:09:02.259 --> 00:09:08.820
that she had found him in the bedroom at home sitting on the edge of the bed with his eyes closed

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:14.259
just signing. And she thought something was wrong with him. So she interrupted him and said,

00:09:14.259 --> 00:09:20.500
what are you doing? And he told her that he was praying. When I heard that it touched my heart,

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:28.340
it was so beautiful to know that Fred was developing strong faith and that he knew that Jehovah

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:34.259
knows sign language and that he was watching his prayers. It was really something. This is a picture

00:09:34.259 --> 00:09:40.419
of Fred on the day that he got baptized. So that's great. Thanks for sharing that. But now I ask you,

00:09:40.419 --> 00:09:45.940
was it smooth sailing for Fred after that? No, no, he had many challenges. And one of those

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:53.220
was that he was losing his eyesight gradually. And that was tough for him. Here's a man who

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:59.779
loved to learn. He relied on the sign language videos for spiritual food. And he was going blind.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:07.139
But he didn't give up. In his 60s, he started to learn braille. And he also had to learn tactile

00:10:07.139 --> 00:10:14.340
signing. Now, tactile, could you explain that? Sure. On its most basic level, tactile is

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:19.620
signing into another person's hands so that they can feel the signs and understand what's being

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:26.980
communicated. So that congregation there in Tennessee was just full of self-sacrificing brothers

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:31.700
and sisters who would help him. They would go over to his house and help him prepare for the meetings

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:37.860
by signing the information into his hand so that he could know what was going to be discussed.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:43.299
And then at the Kingdom Hall during the meetings, we would all pitch in and do tactile

00:10:43.299 --> 00:10:48.500
signing for him so that he could keep up and follow along with the meetings. This is a picture of

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:53.620
him there listening to one of the congregation meetings in sign language. You know, that shows a

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:59.539
lot of determination. Not just by Fred, but those in the congregation yourselves as well. Thank you

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:07.460
for that. Well, Fred was determined and he would be there following along with the meetings. And

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:13.220
there might be a question. And so his hand would just shoot up. He wanted to comment. And I would

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:17.460
see that and think, wow, you know, Fred, he's getting it. He's still able to participate. It was

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:25.059
beautiful. Yeah. It is inspiring. We appreciate you sharing that. So no, in conclusion, how do you

00:11:25.059 --> 00:11:31.700
think your experiences with the sign language field have helped you to prepare for any future

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:37.059
assignments that may come your way? Well, I feel like it's helped me to learn to be adaptable

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:43.299
and to remember that there's not just one way that things should be done. And also when you're

00:11:43.299 --> 00:11:49.059
meeting new people, to really work to try to see the person and not just what you see at first

00:11:49.139 --> 00:11:59.139
glance. I think about Fred a lot. He would express frustration at his situation and the challenges he

00:11:59.139 --> 00:12:03.940
was facing, but he wouldn't dwell on it. He would very quickly redirect his attention to Jehovah

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:08.659
and how Jehovah was supporting him to get through those challenges and getting to know him helped

00:12:08.659 --> 00:12:15.139
me to be more empathetic. But I also saw his humility and the fact that he would not give up

00:12:15.139 --> 00:12:20.179
in the face of adversity. So those are some qualities that I want to continue to develop

00:12:20.179 --> 00:12:25.139
wherever our journey takes us. Those are great expressions. Thank you both. Thank you for

00:12:25.139 --> 00:12:38.159
sharing your story. And by the way, how do you sign? Thank you. Thank you. Our next guest is

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:44.480
Brother Christopher Kits. Before he came to Gilead, he had a very interesting assignment. Please

00:12:44.480 --> 00:13:01.899
welcome Chris. Chris, before we talk about your most recent assignment, I'd like to talk about your

00:13:01.899 --> 00:13:10.139
early years as a cellist evangelizer. Okay. So this picture, how old were you? I was about four

00:13:10.139 --> 00:13:15.179
years old right there. Four years old. And I see even back in the day that you were very

00:13:15.179 --> 00:13:19.980
fashion conscious. Thank you. Personally, I think it's the socks with the sandals that brought that

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:26.860
whole outfit together. Yeah. Well, we love the picture and we have, we understand you had to love

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:35.259
for the ministry too. So it tells us a little bit about those early years. Yeah, I always had a joy

00:13:35.259 --> 00:13:42.539
in the ministry. I loved it. It was my happy place. My mother would pick me up from school as a kid

00:13:42.539 --> 00:13:48.299
and she would take me out with her and the other pioneers. And when I got baptized, I started

00:13:48.299 --> 00:13:53.899
auxiliary pioneering. And then as soon as I graduated from high school, I started regular pioneering.

00:13:53.899 --> 00:13:59.899
Wow, that's excellent, Chris. Now understand that you also had a theoretical goal from a very young

00:14:00.539 --> 00:14:07.820
age. Yeah. I got baptized at 10 and my circuit overseer at the time was Richard Ash. And he got

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:14.460
down on his knee and he said to me, Christopher, when you grow up, you're going to be a circuit overseer

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:22.860
just like me. And his words had a big impact on my little heart. I cherished them and I actually

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:30.139
said, circuit work is a goal. Well, did you meet that goal? I did, but we had a lot of work to do

00:14:30.139 --> 00:14:37.740
before we got there. In 2005, I went to the ministerial training school. And then after that, I got a

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:45.179
signed from where I grew up in Long Island, New York to the potato farms of Wisconsin. In a

00:14:45.179 --> 00:14:52.299
little town called Annago, I spent three years there. And then I went to the Amish country.

00:14:52.299 --> 00:14:59.179
I spent six years in an even smaller town called Nielsville. And then I spent three years in

00:14:59.179 --> 00:15:06.059
Wassau, Little City. And that experience was amazing because that's where Jehovah gave me my

00:15:06.059 --> 00:15:14.460
training. I learned a lot about myself. Jehovah rubbed off a lot of the rough edges. I learned about

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:22.139
faith. Because in those assignments, I saw Jehovah always provide me work places to live in areas

00:15:22.139 --> 00:15:30.379
where sometimes there weren't. And I saw some of my Bible students progress to baptism. And I made

00:15:30.379 --> 00:15:38.779
friendships that will less forever. And then in 2018, I was invited into the circuit work, down in

00:15:38.779 --> 00:15:46.539
Richmond, Virginia. And that was amazing. I was in the circuit work there for about a year. And it

00:15:46.539 --> 00:15:55.659
was about 30 years later that I ran into brother Ash when I was visiting Bethel. And I got to tell him

00:15:55.659 --> 00:16:03.179
he was right. And I got to share with him what an impact he had on me as a child. And it really

00:16:03.179 --> 00:16:09.259
made me think of the impact that spiritually mature ones can have on young ones, helping them to

00:16:09.259 --> 00:16:16.460
set goals that can help them have the best life now. That's an excellent experience. Thank you for

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:23.259
sharing, Chris. So it must have been a great moment for the two of you. But now what's surprising

00:16:23.259 --> 00:16:30.620
assignment followed that? Yeah, I was appointed a missionary and I was sent to the East Africa branch.

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:34.059
And I was assigned to circuit work in Darcelam, Tanzania.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:41.980
So from Virginia to Tanzania, that's quite a job. So how did you feel about that?

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:50.220
I was excited. It was a new adventure. And I didn't know the language. So I'd have to learn Swahili.

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:54.700
I'd have to learn Tanzania and sign language. So I would have an interpreter that would travel

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:59.820
with me from congregation to congregation. So it was a new adventure with me and Jehovah and

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:05.339
new culture. I couldn't wait. There must have been challenges, though. And I think you

00:17:06.539 --> 00:17:12.619
related one to me or more that happened soon after you got there. So can you tell us about that

00:17:12.619 --> 00:17:20.779
and the effect it had on you? Yeah. Yeah. As soon as I arrived in my assignment in Darcelam,

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:29.980
the COVID-19 pandemic started. And so now I wasn't going to be able to visit the congregations in

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:35.420
person. I would not meet the brothers and sisters face to face. I would have to serve them over

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:44.140
Zoom and over the phone. And about six months into my assignment, I woke up one morning and I had

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:53.099
some pressure on my chest. And I was feeling anxiety because I was alone. I was isolated.

00:17:53.099 --> 00:18:01.259
My interpreter lived six hours away. He connected over Zoom and over the phone. And because I showed up

00:18:01.259 --> 00:18:10.059
to this little village, the same time the pandemic started. As a foreigner, not knowing the language,

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:17.900
it created some real difficulties between me and some of the villagers. So I was feeling anxiety.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:25.500
I was feeling alone. There were times I was scared. And for one of the first times in my life,

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:33.660
I was feeling depressed. So I went to Jehovah in prayer and I asked him, did I do something wrong?

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:42.140
Should I go home? Chris, that must have been such a difficult time. How did Jehovah help you?

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:50.059
Jehovah is amazing. He helped me right away see what the solution was. I was giving so much

00:18:50.059 --> 00:18:58.059
in the assignment. I needed more time alone with Jehovah. So I started waking up at 5.30 in the

00:18:58.059 --> 00:19:05.740
morning. And that's early for me. I liked my sleep. But it was what I needed. I'd make my coffee

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:12.380
and I would go outside and I'd watch the African sun wake up. And as I would watch the sun rise,

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:20.299
I felt peace because I felt like Jehovah was right there with me. And it grounded me. It put

00:19:20.299 --> 00:19:26.220
me in the right frame of mind to start my Bible reading. And so before I started, I would say a

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:33.579
prayer to Jehovah and I asked him, Jehovah, talk to me. Let me hear your voice.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:40.779
And then I started my reading and I would read until I found something that applied to me.

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:48.700
And then I'd stop, meditate and think about it and talk to Jehovah about it. And that really

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:54.940
brought me peace that helped calm me down. And I would be reading and there were times where

00:19:54.940 --> 00:20:01.339
it was as if the words would pop off the page. For example, there was one morning where I was in

00:20:01.339 --> 00:20:11.099
the book of Lamentations chapter 3. And I was reading in verse 22 and it said there, it is because

00:20:11.099 --> 00:20:18.539
of Jehovah's loyal love that we have not come to our finish. And when I read that, I thought,

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:27.259
Jehovah is protecting me in my assignment. And then it said next, for his mercies never end,

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:34.940
they're new each morning. And that was true. I was seeing Jehovah's mercy every morning. His

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:42.900
undeserved kindness was painting me a new sunrise. But verse 24 is what changed my life.

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:55.089
It says, Jehovah is my share. Jehovah was with me. And it says next, that's why I will show a waiting

00:20:55.089 --> 00:21:07.309
attitude for him. And it was like Jehovah was saying, Chris, just wait. Don't give up. That brought

00:21:07.309 --> 00:21:16.509
me so much peace after I read that scripture. My anxiety went away. The fears that I had were gone.

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:24.029
And as long as I maintained that routine, I didn't feel depressed. I just continued in my assignment.

00:21:24.589 --> 00:21:30.430
I found that I had more energy to give the brothers and sisters. I was able to spend more time

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:36.509
shepherding. And on Saturdays, I would spend time with the young ones on Zoom and listen to their

00:21:36.509 --> 00:21:43.309
stories and find out what were they doing to help them get through the pandemic. And their answers

00:21:43.309 --> 00:21:48.990
built my faith. Chris, I believe you are going to share one of those, a picture of one of those

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:55.869
beautiful African sunrises with us. Is that not true? Yeah. That picture doesn't even do a justice.

00:21:55.869 --> 00:22:02.589
Yeah. Well, I can see why that would help you. And you know, we don't typically think of the book

00:22:02.589 --> 00:22:08.829
of limitations as a book of comfort. But that's a great scripture to remember. So thanks for sharing

00:22:08.829 --> 00:22:15.869
that with us. Now, Chris, as you look back on your journey, you definitely had some high notes

00:22:15.869 --> 00:22:23.869
and some low notes. So what lessons have you learned? I learned that love transcends language.

00:22:24.829 --> 00:22:32.430
Love has the ability to bypass the mind where words are formed into sentences. And it

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:40.509
can pierce right into the heart where emotions and feelings come from. I needed an interpreter

00:22:40.509 --> 00:22:48.990
to translate my words. But love needs no interpretation. Those brothers and sisters could see how

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:54.349
much I loved them as I struggled to learn their language. And I saw how much they loved me

00:22:54.990 --> 00:23:01.470
as they patiently worked with me and helped me. And I could see Jehovah's love for them.

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:08.269
It was coming off the pages of the Bible as we read them scriptures. And I could see their love

00:23:08.269 --> 00:23:15.309
for Jehovah as they implicitly followed the direction from the governing body. They viewed it as

00:23:15.309 --> 00:23:23.630
coming from Jehovah and they followed it even if it came to them at a cost. And I also learned

00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:32.509
that you can see Jehovah in creation. And you can hear his voice in your Bible reading. And you

00:23:32.509 --> 00:23:42.349
can feel his love coming from the brothers and sisters even over Zoom. And this assignment taught me

00:23:43.309 --> 00:23:52.509
that even if you feel lonely or if you're isolated because of a pandemic or you're in prison bonds,

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:54.750
you're never alone.

00:23:56.589 --> 00:24:02.109
Chris, thank you for sharing your illuminating story with us. Thank you very much.

00:24:03.549 --> 00:24:09.549
So could you hear it, friends? As you saw, each of our students had a unique journey in their

00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:15.309
service to Jehovah. Things didn't always go as planned. There were some setbacks and there were

00:24:15.309 --> 00:24:22.190
some tears. But in each case, they fully relied on their father, Jehovah. And with his help,

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:28.589
they got past those low notes. And we can too. Because Jehovah greatly values not just our

00:24:28.589 --> 00:24:36.430
accomplishments, but the journey itself. Your faithful service is like a pleasing melody in Jehovah's

00:24:36.509 --> 00:24:42.829
heart. He cherishes all that you do for his name. And remembering that should give us comfort,

00:24:42.829 --> 00:24:51.470
hope, and joy even now. The words of Isaiah 29 echo this thought. Let me read this for us.

00:24:52.670 --> 00:25:01.470
This would be Isaiah 3029. It says, but your song will be like the one song in the night when you

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:08.430
prepare for a festival. And your heart will rejoice like one who walk to the flute on his way to

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:15.950
the mountain of Jehovah to the rock of Israel. Some brothers and sisters, don't give up and don't

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:50.059
stop making beautiful music till the next time on the inside story. Well, those comments were

00:25:50.059 --> 00:25:57.099
priceless. Thank you very much, brother Kothin and the students soon to be graduates who were

00:25:57.099 --> 00:26:07.099
involved with that program. That was delightful.
