00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.860
I'd like to talk to you on the theme, do the math.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.859
Yes, you heard right, do the math.

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:14.160
Now, math may not be your favorite subject,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.559
but as we're going to see, someone has to do it.

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:21.559
Sometimes, doing the math is the only way we can make a timeline

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:23.760
or get interesting background information

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.960
that makes our Bible reading more enjoyable.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.760
And you do want to make your Bible reading more enjoyable, don't you?

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.159
Of course you do.

00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:34.960
Well, let's start with a number.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.460
We might quickly skip over in our Bible reading.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.259
Let's turn to Matthew chapter 19 and verse 28.

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:46.659
And let's see how a number can sometimes tell us more

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:49.159
than what's written on the page.

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:52.460
Matthew 19 and verse 28.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.560
Jesus said to them, truly, I say to you in the recreation

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.159
when the son of man sits down on his glorious throne,

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.859
you who have followed me will sit on 12 thrones

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:10.760
judging the 12 tribes of Israel.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.230
Did you see anything interesting there?

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.629
I'll give you a hint.

00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:23.430
These words respoke near the end of Jesus' earthly ministry.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.730
Does that give you a hint?

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.629
I'll give you another hint.

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:30.730
The number 12.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.430
At this point, Jesus knew that only 11 of his apostles

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.930
were going to be faithful.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.629
Yet, he said there would be 12 thrones in the kingdom,

00:01:40.629 --> 00:01:41.930
not 11.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.329
What did it mean?

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:47.930
It meant that Judas would have to be replaced as an apostle.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.530
And sure enough, he was.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.129
Well, that was easy, wasn't it?

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:54.530
There was no math involved.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.129
It was just a number.

00:01:56.129 --> 00:01:59.629
But let's see how doing the math can help us to answer

00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:02.629
a few questions.

00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:05.230
During family worship, one of the kids

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.330
asked whether Noah and Abraham knew each other.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.030
How are you going to handle that?

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.629
Do you know?

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:18.530
You might just say the Bible doesn't say and leave it at that.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.129
But you could figure it out if you did the math.

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.930
Now, here's what we know.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.330
The flood occurred in 2370 BCE.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.030
Now, that date is absolutely solid.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.330
And if you'd like to figure it out for yourself,

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.830
you can look it up under chronology in the Insight book.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.830
2370 BCE, that's the flood.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.330
And Noah lived for 350 years after the flood.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.729
So by subtracting 350 from 2370,

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:57.930
we learned that Noah died in 2020 BCE.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.530
But remember the question.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.879
The question is, did Noah and Abraham know each other?

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:12.379
Abraham answered the land of Canaan in 1943 BCE.

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.680
Now, once again, if you want to prove that to yourself,

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.680
look at Insight under chronology.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.180
You'll find everything you need to prove it to yourself.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.879
So 1943, Abraham, Abraham, in that case,

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.879
he enters the land of Canaan.

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:31.580
And he's 75 years old at the time.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.479
So Abraham must have been born 75 years before 1943.

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:40.879
Add 75 to 1943.

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:45.879
And you'll find that Abraham was born in 2018 BCE.

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.979
So Noah died in 2020.

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:53.379
And Abraham was born two years later in 2018.

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:59.360
They never knew each other, but it was close.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.860
Our publications have often said that Jonathan

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.259
was at least 30 years older than David.

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:08.460
But the Bible doesn't say that.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.060
Your progressive Bible student, you know,

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.460
the one who makes you prove everything, he asks you about that.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.060
Can you prove it?

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.459
Can you?

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.259
You can if you do the math.

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:25.959
King Saul ruled Israel for 40 years.

00:04:25.959 --> 00:04:27.959
Then David became king.

00:04:27.959 --> 00:04:30.660
The how old was David when he became king?

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.259
The Bible says he was 30 years old.

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:36.860
That means that when David was born,

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.560
Saul had already been ruling Israel for 10 years.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.459
But when Saul became king,

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:45.259
Jonathan was a grown man.

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:47.959
He was probably already in the army.

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:51.560
You had to be at least 20 years old to be in the army.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.360
So if Jonathan was at least 20 when Saul began to rule

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.160
and David was born 10 years after that,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.259
what difference in age would there be between Jonathan and David?

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:07.759
About 30 years difference.

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:12.970
20 plus 10 equals 30.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.870
Now the next one is a bit more complicated.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.769
It's the last one.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.870
And we can do this.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.870
Inside on the scriptures says that Moses and Job

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.970
lived at the same time.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.470
But the Bible doesn't say that.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.269
How can we be so sure?

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:34.269
Once again, what do we do?

00:05:34.269 --> 00:05:35.769
Do I hear it?

00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:36.769
You're right.

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:39.670
We do the math.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:44.970
Job's test must have occurred sometime after the death of Joseph.

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:47.569
We know that because at Job chapter 1,

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:49.069
Jehovah told Satan,

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:52.870
there is no one like Job on the earth.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.069
No one.

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:55.970
Now if Joseph had still been alive,

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:56.970
Jehovah would have said,

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.269
there was no one like Joseph and Job on the earth.

00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:03.569
And if the test had occurred earlier,

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:04.569
Jehovah would have said,

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:07.670
there was no one like Jacob and Job,

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.170
Isaac and Job, Abraham and Job.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.370
And remember,

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.370
there were only two years between Noah and Abraham.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.769
So we can conclude that the test of Job occurred

00:06:19.769 --> 00:06:22.870
after the death of Joseph.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.569
When did Joseph die?

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:27.769
The date is solid.

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:31.769
It's 1657 BCE.

00:06:31.769 --> 00:06:34.269
How do we figure that?

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:35.769
If you don't like math,

00:06:35.769 --> 00:06:36.870
trust me.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.170
You don't want to know.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.370
But inside and the Bible will give you

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.870
all the information you need to figure it out for yourself.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.470
But let's keep it simple.

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.470
Let's go with 1657 BCE.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:55.670
That's 144 years before Israel left Egypt

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:00.970
under the direction of Moses in 1513 BCE.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.769
So Job's test must have occurred sometime

00:07:04.769 --> 00:07:08.870
within that 144 year period.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.269
Now this is a big hint.

00:07:11.269 --> 00:07:16.970
144 years before Israel left Egypt.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.970
Are you beginning to put it together?

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.269
Here is the clincher.

00:07:22.269 --> 00:07:28.170
Job lived for 140 years after he passed the test.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.970
So he was probably still alive in the land of us

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.069
when Israel left Egypt.

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:34.470
Conclusion,

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:40.470
Job and Moses definitely lived at the same time.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:43.870
So what if we learn by doing the math?

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.670
Superficially, we might say,

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:51.170
well, we learned that Abraham was born two years after Noah

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:55.769
and we proved that Jonathan was at least 30 years older than David

00:07:55.769 --> 00:07:59.670
and that Moses and Job definitely lived at the same time.

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:03.970
Superficially, we got the answers to those questions, yes.

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.870
But the fact is, probably none of those questions

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:09.870
ever kept you up at night.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.970
There's a broader picture here.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.370
What we'd like you to take away

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:18.370
is the fact that sometimes a number is more than just a number.

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:22.170
It can provide information that we couldn't get any other way.

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:24.670
And if we can understand that,

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:28.670
this discussion will have been well worth having.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:31.470
So when you see a number in the Bible,

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:33.370
don't run the other way.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:34.570
Embrace it.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:36.470
Stop and think about it.

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:38.370
You may be glad you did.
