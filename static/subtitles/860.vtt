00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:10.990
As you can see, this is a mirror.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.990
Did you look into a mirror before you came here?

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.989
Perhaps judging by your neat and clean appearance, you obviously did.

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:30.989
Ancient mirrors were generally made of metal, such as bronze or copper, even silver and gold.

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:40.990
They had to be highly polished, but still did not have as finer reflecting surface as do glass mirrors.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.990
This is why the Apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 13-12,

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:53.990
for now we see an easy outline by means of the metal mirror.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:00.990
Probably only in the first century, glass mirrors were introduced.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:08.989
In the scriptures, we find two figurative uses of the term mirror.

00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:16.989
For instance, in James, chapter 1, verses 22 to 25, it says,

00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:24.989
however, become doers of the word and not heroes only, deceiving yourselves with false reasoning.

00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:35.239
For if anyone is a hero of the word and not a doer, this is like a man looking at his own face in a mirror,

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:42.239
for he looks at himself and he goes away and immediately forgets of what sort of person he is but.

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:51.239
The one who peers into the perfect law that belongs to freedom and continues in it has become not a forgetful hero,

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:57.239
but a doer of the work, and he will be happy in what he does.

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:09.870
And the Apostle Paul showed that Christians reflect like mirrors the glory of Jehovah in their ministry.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:20.900
In chapter 3, he wrote, chapter 3 and verse 18,

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:29.900
and all of us, while we, with unveiled faces, reflect like mirrors the glory of Jehovah,

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:39.900
are transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another, exactly as it's done by Jehovah the Spirit.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:51.900
And in chapter 6, verse 1, he says, therefore, since we have this ministry through the mercy that was shown us, we do not give up.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:03:00.900
So God's word is compared to a mirror that we can use to examine ourselves.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.900
On the other hand, also Christians themselves are compared to a mirror.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.900
A mirror that reflects Jehovah's glory.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.310
So how do the Scriptures use the word glory?

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.310
Well, there are different types of glory.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:27.310
In 1 Corinthians chapter 15, verses 40 to 44, it says,

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.310
and there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.310
But the glory of the heavenly bodies is one sort, and that of the earthly bodies is a different sort.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.310
The glory of the sun is one sort. The glory of the moon is another.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.310
And the glory of the stars is another.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.310
In fact, star differs from another star in glory.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.310
So it is with the resurrection of the dead.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.310
It is shown in corruption. It's raised up in corruption.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.310
It's shown in dishonor. It's raised up in glory.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.310
It's shown in weakness. It's raised up in power.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.310
It's shown a physical body. It's raised up a spiritual body.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:17.040
Now, let's discuss five types of glory.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:24.040
Of course, Jehovah has and deserves the highest degree of glory.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:30.040
Then there's the glory of Jesus, which is second to the one of God.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.040
In John 1, 14, it says,

00:04:34.040 --> 00:05:00.350
The Bible shows that Jesus was given more glory after his resurrection than he had before he came to the earth.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.350
It says, Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels,

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:12.350
now crowned with glory and honor for having suffered death.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.350
Hebrews 2 verse 9.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:22.350
The third point, anointed Christians also have a measure of glory.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:31.350
In the first century, there were some that were speaking abusively of glorious ones,

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:37.350
who were the glorious ones in the first century, anointed overseers.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:43.350
They had a measure of glory when they lived on earth.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.350
Number 4. When taken to heaven, all anointed.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:53.350
Not only anointed overseers will receive everlasting glory.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.350
Second Timothy 2 10 says,

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.350
quote,

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:01.350
For this reason, I go on enduring all things for the sake of the chosen ones,

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:10.350
so that they too may obtain the salvation that is through Christ Jesus along with everlasting glory.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:18.600
But we have today not a few, but many glorious ones sitting even in the audience right here.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.600
How so?

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:28.600
Because the expression glorious ones refers also to elders with an earthly hope.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:37.600
The watchtower 1997, September 1, page 16 verse 14 says,

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:43.600
quote, Christian elders represent the glorious Jehovah God and His Son,

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:49.600
and as a result have certain glory conferred upon them.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.600
True, they make mistakes as did Peter himself,

00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:01.600
but the Scriptures urged members of the congregation to be submissive to such glorious ones.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.600
End of quote.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.600
And number 5.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:12.600
There's the glorious good news, no matter what hope we have.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.600
We glorify Jehovah through our preaching and teaching.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.600
Second Corinthians 4, 3 and 4 says,

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.600
in fact, the good news we declare is veiled.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.600
It is veiled among those who are perishing,

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.600
among the God over the system of things,

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:38.600
has blinded the minds of the unbelievers so that the illumination of the glorious good news about the Christ might not shine through.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:44.740
How can we all glorify Jehovah?

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:50.740
Not only overseers and other adults in the congregation reflect Jehovah's glory,

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.740
also children can do so.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.740
Children, are you aware of it?

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:07.740
You too, yes, we all can glorify Jehovah how in at least six ways,

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:12.740
or starting with 1.1.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.740
We glorify Him through our prayers,

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:20.740
and then also by singing kingdom songs.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:26.740
Another point, we glorify Him by accumulating accurate knowledge.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:31.740
Second Corinthians 4, 6, therefore says,

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:35.740
for God is the one who said, let the light shine out of darkness,

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:45.740
and He is shown on our hearts to illuminate them with the glorious knowledge of God by the face of Christ.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:50.740
Further, we glorify Jehovah by our Christian conduct.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.740
Yes, we absorb this light of glorious knowledge of God

00:08:54.740 --> 00:09:00.740
and transform our lives according to it, it brings glory to Jehovah God.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:05.740
Once conduct can cause others to give glory to God,

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:11.740
our conduct is not perfect, we all know that, still Jehovah accepts us.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:21.740
However, that does not excuse us from keeping ourselves as mirrors in a clean and polished shape as much as we can.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:29.740
In the dark, no mirror reflects anything except darkness.

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:33.740
A mirror does not have any glory or light in itself.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:43.740
Similarly, we are aware that any glory we might have is just a reflection of God's glory.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.740
First Peter chapter 12 says,

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:53.740
maintain your conduct fine among the nations so that when they accuse you of being wrongdoers,

00:09:53.740 --> 00:10:02.740
they may be eyewitnesses of your fine works, and as a result, glorify God in the day of His inspection.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:09.730
Further, we glorify Him by doing good to others.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:19.730
In Matthew 5.16, in the sermon on the Mount Jesus Himself showed that preaching and teaching is not enough.

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:23.730
We need to do good things to others aside from it.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:28.730
We need to love our neighbors, including those in our workplace.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:37.730
This may prompt people who are not witnesses of Jehovah to glorify God as Jesus put it.

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:44.730
And I quote, let your light shine before me so that they may see you of fine works.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:54.620
So it's not just preaching, fine works, and give glory to your Father who is in the heavens.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:11:00.620
What's another way we all can reflect the glory of Jehovah like mirrors?

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:04.620
We glorify Him by our preaching and teaching.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:13.620
We want to conduct many Bible studies and want to impart the glorious knowledge of God to others.

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.620
For God is the one who said, let the light shine out of darkness,

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:23.620
and He has shown on our hearts to illuminate them, says Paul in 2 Corinthians 4.6,

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:31.620
and He continues, illuminate them with the glorious knowledge of God by the face of Christ.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:40.620
Many of us who are older had the privilege of reflecting the glory of Jehovah for perhaps decades.

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:45.620
Jehovah has allowed us not only the privilege of proclaiming the message of the kingdom,

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:57.620
but also some have served as elders, pioneers, missionaries, Bethelites, construction servants, circuit overseers, or branch committee members.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:02.620
These are ways that we have reflected the glory of Jehovah.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:07.620
What a privilege we've had to do so, haven't we?

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:11.620
In spite of all these privileges, we maintain a humble spirit.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:18.620
We appreciate that the privileges we have enjoyed are an undeserved kindness from Jehovah.

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:26.620
Having enjoyed so many privileges, what unique responsibility do we as older ones now have?

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:36.620
We must allow the next generation to come up so they too can enjoy unique privileges in glorifying Jehovah.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:46.620
They are the next generation of like circuit overseers, Bethelites, missionaries, construction servants, branch committee members, and so on.

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:53.620
We want them to have the marvelous privilege that we have enjoyed as well.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:13:08.620
That means we must look for ways to teach them, to train them, to encourage them so that they may use their youth and strength and ability to glorify Jehovah.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:14.620
What a privilege we have is older ones to train and teach younger ones.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:43.820
With that in mind, it is a pleasure to announce that two additional brothers have been appointed to serve as members of the governing body.

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:48.820
Well, brothers, brothers of Jody, Jedily, and Jacob Rump.

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:55.820
Both brothers are anointed Christians who have a long history of loyal service to Jehovah.

00:13:55.820 --> 00:14:01.820
Jedily began his full-time service in 1989 and Bethel service in 1990.

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:07.820
Brother Rump began his full-time service in 1995 and Bethel service in 2020.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:13.820
Both brothers served as helpers to the service committee of the governing body for a while.

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:20.820
We thank our Heavenly Father Jehovah for raising up such faithful men to share in the work of the governing body.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:26.820
We pray that Jehovah will reachly bless brothers, Jedily, and Rump and their wives.

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:43.200
We all worship our glorious God, Jehovah.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.200
We have the glorious good news to spread.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:51.200
Our whole life is for the glory of His praise.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:59.200
Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 1031, whether you are eating or drinking or doing anything else,

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:04.200
do all things for God's glory.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:14.200
Will you endeavor to reflect like a mirror Jehovah's glory by making the truth manifest in word and example?

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.200
What a privilege.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:28.200
At the end of the millennium, faithful ones on earth will receive and display a measure of glory as perfect sons and daughters of Jehovah.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:43.200
It says in Romans 821, the creation itself will also be set free from enslavement to corruption and have the glorious freedom of the children of God.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:47.200
So keep polishing that mirror.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:51.200
Look at the mirror of God's word every day.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:57.200
And like a mirror, reflect God's glory by what you say and do.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:03.200
Appreciate your privilege to glorify Jehovah God, help young ones to take on privileges of service.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:10.200
We trust your will and we wish you to always reach blessing in this endeavor.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:14.200
So keep polishing, keep reflecting the light.
