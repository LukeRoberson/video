00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:19.829
Well, here in Venezuela, long before the crisis, there weren't so many financial problems

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:24.179
like we have today.

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:36.909
We could go to the stores, we could buy the amount of food we wanted, and life was peaceful.

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:43.310
For us, the situation started to get really bad five years ago.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.469
It was hard to get any food at all, even basic items.

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:53.670
When it came time to buy something, well, it was all gone.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.789
There were two elders that I can say were checking on me almost daily, always asking

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.969
how much food I needed.

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:11.780
When I prepared it and served it, my main concern was that my children would get enough.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.340
I always gave them more food.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.659
Even though my youngest boy would ask,

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.659
Mommy, is that what you're going to eat?

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.739
I would tell him, yes, dear, I'm fine with this.

00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:32.459
Then he would say, I don't think so.

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:37.379
I would think, I can handle this, but the amount that I was eating just wasn't enough

00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:45.590
for my body.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.670
One Sunday morning, during the meeting, I wasn't feeling very well.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.549
But thanks to Jehovah, my daughter was nearby.

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.670
When I came to, she said, Mom, you fainted three times.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.109
I said, that can't be.

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:03.629
So the brothers immediately took me to the doctor.

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:10.039
I was diagnosed as having severe malnutrition.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.639
The brothers began a plan of action.

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:17.439
They brought food that was already prepared, and in fact, they would sit by me until I finished

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:19.990
my food.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.030
I have not yet fully recovered my body weight, because I was a little heavier.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.219
But health wise, I have felt very well.

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:34.139
The elders were always looking after me.

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:42.120
That boosted my energy, and definitely, I never lost my joy.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.639
And it's all thanks to Jehovah.

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:47.680
Thanks to him because he is the one who sustains me.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.360
He cloaks me, he feeds me, and he gives me great friends.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.479
That is what Jehovah gives me.
