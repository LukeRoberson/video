00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.949
Lakita worked for the city of Virginia Beach.

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.429
With the city, she was able to get a schedule

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:29.320
that allowed her to focus on her ministry.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.399
I came home on a Friday, but my mother and I

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.159
had doctor appointments that day.

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:39.119
And we came home, sat down,

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:42.079
get ready to take us a bite of lunch,

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.679
and I got a phone call.

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:48.840
It was a family member, and they were asking me

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.479
if I had saw the news.

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:57.359
I immediately tried to call my daughter's phone,

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:00.159
and it went straight to voicemail.

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:03.119
So I said, well, let me try a text to her.

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:06.079
So I tried texting her.

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:10.099
And I didn't get any response.

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:16.090
It was about 10, 10, 30 that night when we just finally

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.849
got the confirmation that we had indeed lost her

00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:20.769
in that shooting.

00:01:20.769 --> 00:01:31.700
So, and I will say that's the worst day of my life.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.709
The next day, starting at 7 o'clock in the morning,

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:46.390
friends started pouring in, and we had people in our home

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:57.549
to support us and encourage us from morning to night.

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.680
And it meant so much.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:09.080
It helped us to focus on something else at that time.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.400
The love that they showed to us, it was just astounding.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.400
It was just so amazing.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.960
And that's what helped us to get through, to get through it all.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:32.629
It was our family, our spiritual family.

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.389
The city of Virginia Beach, they volunteered

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:43.039
to take care of all of the victims' arrangements.

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:46.800
Because of that amount of people, the venue

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.400
that they decided upon, it was the opera house in Norfolk.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.319
The brothers, they got everything together.

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.120
The city didn't really have to do anything.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.280
It just gave us the venue.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.520
And what really impressed them, the city,

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.319
was that the whole memorial, everything,

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.800
took place within an hour.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.120
The city officials were there in attendance.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.520
You had the local newspapers who covered it, reporters.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.960
The reporters were persistent and wanted to talk, to talk.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.879
And so actually two of my brothers,

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:34.000
they handled all of that information with the guidance

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:36.520
from those two brothers who came down.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.680
It kept us from having to even worry about that.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.560
So it was very helpful.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.599
I'd continue to get cards.

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.240
I get texts from people.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.379
And it just encourages me.

00:03:54.379 --> 00:04:00.979
Isaiah 4110 has become my favorite scripture.

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:04.659
I will really hold on to you with my right hand

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:06.539
of righteousness.

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:12.180
Going through this, I could really feel Jehovah's hand.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.779
It's as if he was rubbing my shoulders and saying,

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:21.259
it's going to be all right.

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:22.100
He'll be all right.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.980
I'm going to get you through this.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:31.720
And he has, each day, he gets me through this.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.319
If it can happen to someone else, it can happen to me.

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:37.920
And in this instance, it did.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.759
But that helps me to keep a perspective.

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:50.720
And I reflect on how Jehovah is going to reverse it.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.680
That's my biggest hope.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.000
It's to see Jehovah reverse the damage that has been done.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.600
He's promised it.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.959
And my faith is in the fulfillment of his promises.

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:10.439
So I look forward to being reunited with my daughter.
