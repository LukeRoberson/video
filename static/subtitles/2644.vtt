00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:09.019
But since the hour was already late, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.900
Well, it's time for us to go to work, so we'll give thanks to Joe.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:36.429
Mood when the brothers and sisters arrive here at Warwick to start their day is electric.

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:39.429
We see buses pulling in with hundreds of our brothers and sisters,

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:43.429
and they come streaming out all headed to their work locations

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:47.429
with smiles on their faces ready to give a full day's work.

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:53.990
Being an overseer on the project, one thing I do enjoy is

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.990
arriving on the site as early as possible.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.990
Not just to see the brothers come in, but to be here to respond to questions right away.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.299
Every morning, the crews always start with safety,

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.299
so they'll have a safety huddle or a safety meeting prior to the work.

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.299
Once they're done, they're like ants, just pouring out over the property

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.299
and then you hear the tools start, the site becomes noisy at that point with construction.

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:35.939
The visitor parking garage here at Warwick will be able to hold 277 vehicles.

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.939
This building was basically almost like a Lego building, 150 truckloads.

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.939
Concrete pieces came in and they set the building in about two and a half weeks.

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.760
I'm overseeing the vehicle maintenance building.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.760
When you have a project like this with volunteers, you have to feed them.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.760
So the vehicle maintenance building is being used as a field dining room

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.760
during the interim phase of the project.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:10.520
The office services building will serve the needs of the Bethel family.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.520
There's many areas such as the infirmary, the laundry, the kitchen and that building,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.520
as well as the office space, which will be great for the government body to work in there with such nice surroundings.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.520
It's really a diverse building. It's like a branch within one building.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.849
The maintenance building is up the hill from the office services building.

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:39.849
It's going to contain the powerhouse, the parking garage for the Bethel family,

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:46.500
and also all the maintenance shops.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.500
We have four residents buildings on site.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.500
Each building is two phases.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.500
The first phase are outside contractors that are providing the foundation and the superstructure

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.500
to be followed by the construction groups, which are our RBC family.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.500
As they come through, they'll take care of all of the interior dimensions.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:18.129
The schedule on this project is unlike any other project that I know.

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:23.129
The site is alive with activity seven days a week.

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:30.129
It's caused us to really look into and be creative with prefabbing certain parts of the project

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.129
or bringing in large groups of brothers from across the country

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.129
or contracting certain portions of the job out there.

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:42.129
Working with outside contractors on the Warwick project has many positive aspects.

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.129
These contractors come with professionalism and skill.

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:49.129
It also too has enabled us to keep pace with the accelerated schedule

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:53.129
that without them would have been difficult for us to be able to accomplish.

00:03:53.129 --> 00:04:00.879
One of the times is always a challenge with construction and we had a very hard win.

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:08.729
In spite of the cold, the brothers and sisters show up every day.

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:09.729
They're willing to work.

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:13.729
Sisters stand out in the cold for hours doing their job.

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:19.730
And it just shows to me the willingness and the enthusiasm that our brothers and sisters have.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:26.009
We have a wide range of brothers and sisters that come on the project.

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.009
Some are 20 years old.

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:31.009
We have some that are in their 70s.

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:35.009
And we appreciate the experience that these ones that have had families,

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:39.009
raised children, and now they're available to come in and help.

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:47.550
I think it's just so beautiful at the end of the day that people are friends.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.550
They want to be together.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.550
They enjoy the conversations and the fellowship.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.550
And I think that's really one of the blessings of this,

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.550
is that it's drawing people from all different places,

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.550
and that's only because of Jehovah's Spirit.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.550
What we're doing here in building the new World Headquarters,

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.550
reaches to the worldwide field.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.550
The spiritual food that will be prepared here

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.550
will reach to all of our brothers and sisters,

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.550
and will provide encouragement for them, instruction,

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.550
as we continue on serving Jehovah together.
