00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:08.449
Today, there is more information available than ever before.

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:12.449
But the big questions still remain.

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.449
Where do we come from?

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:20.140
Why do bad things happen?

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.969
Why do people die?

00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:27.969
Most religious people think that God controls the world.

00:00:27.969 --> 00:00:29.969
How could that be?

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:32.969
This world is out of control.

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.979
What the Bible says may surprise you.

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:44.579
The Bible is helping millions of people around the world

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.579
find answers to life's big questions.

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.579
