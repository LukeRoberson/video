00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:15.880
This text was taken from the Watch Tsar with the theme Jehovah before serving Jehovah before the days of distress come, and the scripture was Ecclesiastes 121, remember your grand creator.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:23.879
Now for some of us present here this morning we must admit the days of distress have arrived.

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:28.879
Let's open our Bibles and look at something in the 90th Psalm.

00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:40.880
Psalm 9010 says the span of our life is 70 years or 80 if one is especially strong, but they're filled with trouble and sorrow.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.880
They quickly pass by and away we fly.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.880
It makes us think of the words of Barcily.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.880
He made a comment the 2nd Samuel 19.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:00.880
How many days of my life are left that I should go up with the King to Jerusalem? I'm 80 years old today.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:09.879
Can I discern between good and bad? Can I your servant? Taste what I eat and drink? Can I still listen to the voice of male and female singers?

00:01:09.879 --> 00:01:19.879
Now I can tell you from experience when you reach the age of 80 birds may be singing when you wake up in the morning but many of us can't hear them.

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:22.879
We're just too old.

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:26.879
However it goes without saying wisdom the company's age.

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:33.879
So this puts a little light, good light on those of us who are 80 and beyond.

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:38.879
In fact the Bible says the gray hair is a crown of beauty when it is found in the way of righteousness.

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:49.879
Now there are many scriptures in the Hebrew scriptures especially that shed the light on older people in a very favorable way.

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:57.879
One says before gray hair you should rise up and you must show honor to an older man and of course we can include woman.

00:01:57.879 --> 00:02:02.879
And you must be in fear of your God. I am Jehovah.

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:11.879
Jehovah does not leave us when we get old and neither does he forget what we did when we were young and healthy.

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.879
It made me think of a situation that happened in my life when I was a young boy.

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:25.879
My father told me to take our two mules, Jen and Old Jack to the creek so they could drink some water.

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.879
Later my father asked me if I watered the mules.

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.879
I told him yes I took Jim down there and gave him some water.

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:41.879
I didn't bother Old Jack. Old Jack hadn't done anything all day long just stay in the barn.

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:48.879
My father said I want you to go back and get Old Jack and take him down and let him drink some water.

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:54.879
It's like you did Jim. Old Jack has spent his whole life so that we could have bread on the table.

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.879
We're not going to throw him away now that he's grown old.

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:06.879
Well that's stuck with me and it made me think too of what the Bible says in Hebrews 16.

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:16.879
For God is not unrighteous so as to get your work and the love you showed for his name by ministering and continuing to minister to the holy ones.

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:22.879
So Jehovah wants us to continue even when we're older to perform our ministry.

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:26.879
Perhaps to slow down a little but not to stop.

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:32.879
So share the good news you know about the Jehovah and with the next generation.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.879
That's what Psalm 78 encourages us to do.

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.879
It says relate to the generation to come.

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:45.879
Make these things known to their children, the next generation.

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:53.879
So we have the responsibility of those of us who are older, 80 and beyond or 60 and beyond, 50 and beyond.

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.879
You just figure out what's old.

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:00.879
But now where and when can you do that?

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:02.879
How can you encourage the younger ones?

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:05.879
I don't know how you can do that.

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:09.879
Where and when? I don't know your circumstances.

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:13.879
But I'm going to give you some situations, your room.

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:19.879
I remember the governing body invited my wife and I when we were serving in the district here to come to his room for.

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:22.879
And she didn't own his family Bible study.

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:28.879
Well, we thought that's quite an honor my land to be able to come to remember the governing body's room and his wife.

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:30.879
And so we went in.

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:33.879
We studied for the school and service me on the way home.

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:37.879
My wife said, you know, he's steady just like we do.

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:41.879
Well, that's the way we all should study.

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:43.879
What about field service?

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:48.879
Between doors, stopped and smelled roses with the younger ones after you're working with.

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:52.879
Breakfast meals, we used out a good morning in a warm smile.

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:56.879
It may be the best you can do that early in the morning.

00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:01.879
During the noon meal, mentioned how Jehovah's helped you years ago.

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:04.879
What about two and from meetings in the automobile?

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:08.879
Share a comment heard that made your day.

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:11.879
During intermission at circuit and regional conventions.

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:14.879
Oh, well, you're saying I'm too tired for that.

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:19.509
Then just sit there and look happy.

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:21.509
Went in the infirmary.

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:25.509
Nurses like to break the spell of pain and sickness with a little humor.

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:30.509
Show them your picture that was taken on your wedding day 60 years ago.

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:35.509
They will not believe as you and will talk about it when you leave.

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:43.079
Older ones don't concentrate on what you no longer are able to do.

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:45.079
Give what you're able to give.

00:05:45.079 --> 00:05:50.079
Give it joyfully. Share what you still have with the next generation.

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:53.079
It will encourage them and definitely please Jehovah.

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:55.079
Now, what about you, younger ones?

00:05:55.079 --> 00:06:02.079
Well, the Bible tells you to remember your creator in the days of your young manhood or your young womanhood.

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:07.079
Before the calamitous days or the days of distress arrive.

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:10.079
And they're going to come and they're going to hit you like a ton of bricks.

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:17.079
And there's nothing that you will be able to do to prevent that from happening.

00:06:17.079 --> 00:06:24.079
It's just part of being in this wicked world and being filled with sin.

00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:32.079
So Jehovah knows though what we have to give and he doesn't expect us to give anymore than we have.

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:36.079
So do your best. Continue working hard in kingdom service.

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:41.079
Give your youth and vitality to Jehovah.

00:06:41.079 --> 00:06:47.079
You'll never regret it and Jehovah definitely will not forget the love you showed for his name.

00:06:47.079 --> 00:06:54.079
He will see to it that you have the full assurance of the hope down to the end.
