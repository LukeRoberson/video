00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:17.809
Many creatures on Earth have a remarkable ability.

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:24.250
One that is beautiful and amazing.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.250
The ability to emit light, also known as bioluminescence.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.750
But why do some living things glow?

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:42.130
Some animals glow to be noticed.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:48.689
Fireflies combine chemicals to create light,

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:54.310
to catch the eye of a prospective mate.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:01.289
Every species flashes its own unique pattern.

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:08.319
Some even synchronize their flashes.

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:12.319
While fireflies glow to stand out,

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:16.319
some animals glow to disappear.

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:19.319
At about three centimeters long,

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:24.530
Bobtail squid are good at hiding.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.530
But when they come out to feed at night,

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.510
they're vulnerable.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.510
By the light of the moon and stars,

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.510
they're still a white could be seen by predators below.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.510
So they illuminate their underside

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.510
to match the light from above

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.510
and effectively vanish.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:51.390
A Bobtail squid alone produces no light.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.280
So how does it glow?

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.280
After the squid hatches,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.280
a unique bacteria colonizes its undeveloped light organ

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.280
and switches on genes in the squid

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.280
that cause the light organ to finish growing.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.280
The bacteria live in the organ

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.099
and produce light for the squid.

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.099
The squid cannot grow a working light organ

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.099
if it never meets the bacteria

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:25.990
and no other bacteria can inhabit this organ.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.990
This ability of some living things to emit light

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.990
is more than just beautiful.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.990
It's a marvel of energy efficiency.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.990
No man-made source of light

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.990
can match the energy efficiency of creatures that glow.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.990
But a process is elegant and efficient as this

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.990
is not as simple as lighting a match.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.990
Both fireflies and Bobtail squid

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.990
grow complex organs that include a reflector,

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.990
a lens, and a filter,

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.990
just like man-made lighting.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.969
All over our planet,

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:11.969
there are many organisms that emit light,

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:16.569
such as fungi, insects,

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:22.509
jellyfish, squid,

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:25.509
and fish.

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:29.509
And every species uses a different combination of chemicals

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:32.509
to produce light.

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:34.509
What do you think?

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:39.509
Did the ability to produce light from life evolve

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:42.509
or was it designed?
