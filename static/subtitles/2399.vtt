Outside the box, be someone who talks Don't waste the way behind that tiny screen

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.250
Because you know there's much more to life The friend requesting likes

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.250
Think of all the things we haven't seen Well, yeah

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.250
You'll never see them if you're focused on a superficial

00:00:34.250 --> 00:01:05.700
You need real friends to take the time to see

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.700
See what others see Don't trade that plastic box for all your friends

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.700
You can make the friends you know are true

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.700
We'd love your whole but two And stand right by your side until the end
