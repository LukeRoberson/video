00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.019
It's certainly an interesting text for us today, very well known.

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:10.820
And we appreciate that Jehovah reveals to us what we need, what we need to know in order

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.019
to be happy, and what we need in order to serve Him faithfully.

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:23.300
But there are some things that Jehovah God has not revealed to us, things that we may

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:31.300
be curious about, things that we really don't know.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.380
But our curiosity may persist even though it's something we are not able to know or fully

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.060
understand.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.380
For example, our text comment tells us that we don't need to know the names of all of

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.460
the anointed on earth today.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.979
And the last sentence in the text comment tells us that it would be pointless to try and

00:00:52.979 --> 00:01:01.060
ascertain who among God's servants will eventually be part of the 144,000.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:09.219
The final judgment and sealing of the anointed is a very private matter between Jehovah and

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:11.620
individual anointed ones.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:20.700
However, some of us may be a bit like Peter, curious about others and what God's will

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.739
is for them.

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:29.019
But frankly speaking brothers and sisters, our curiosity does have to be controlled.

00:01:29.019 --> 00:01:36.420
We need to recognize our limitations and there are things that really don't pertain

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.420
to us.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.489
Let's read a scripture text on this point at John chapter 21.

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:48.969
John 21 will read verses 20 through 23.

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:54.609
This follows Jesus telling Peter what sort of death he would undergo.

00:01:54.609 --> 00:02:01.689
And so John 21, 21 through 23, it says in verse 20, Peter turned around and saw the

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.329
disciple whom Jesus loved following.

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.769
That would be the Apostle John.

00:02:06.769 --> 00:02:13.050
The one who at the evening meal had also leaned back on his chest and said, Lord, who is the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.889
one betraying you?

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:21.169
So when he caught sight of him, that is Peter caught sight of John following, Peter said

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:25.009
to Jesus, Lord, what about this man?

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:27.889
Well, Peter had just learned what sort of death he would undergo.

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:30.889
Now he wanted to know about John.

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:38.729
Jesus said to him, if it is my will for him to remain until I come, of what concern is

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:40.729
that to you?

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:43.009
Isn't that interesting?

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:46.330
You continue following me.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.969
And that's the key point.

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:51.810
And then it goes on, it says, so the saying went out among the brothers that this disciple

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.650
would not die.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.289
Well, rumors sometimes start circulating.

00:02:57.289 --> 00:03:01.129
We hear something and then we pass it on and maybe misunderstood.

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:07.569
However, Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but he said, if it is my will

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:15.590
for him to remain until I come, of what concern is that to you?

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.710
That probably stifled Peter for a few moments on that occasion, slowed him down a bit.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:27.150
But Peter didn't go away distressed or upset with Jesus not telling him how John would

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.669
remain until Jesus came.

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:36.789
And that would be when Jesus revealed to John about his personal, his coming in the kingdom

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:41.430
in the future, and John wrote it all down in the book of Revelation.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.949
And that was done in about the year 96.

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:51.949
So Peter was curious about what was going to happen with John, but he didn't know, didn't

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:58.389
have the right to know about something that pertained to Jesus and to John.

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:00.949
It was private.

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:05.909
Knowing the names of brothers and sisters in our congregation is of interest to us.

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:10.710
Frankly, I'm finding it a little bit difficult at times to remember names in a new congregation

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.949
when I have to call on brothers.

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:16.509
But little by little, we learn.

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:21.750
And usually we, of the other sheep, know who partakes of the emblems because after all

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:30.069
in our congregation, we see that the emblems being passed and we can see individuals partaking

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:34.189
in a sense, telling us that yes, they have the heavenly calling.

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:35.829
We see it at the memorial.

00:04:35.829 --> 00:04:42.389
And I might also add at this point, even though we don't know about that personal relationship

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:49.389
that comes about, we don't experience it ourselves, but we are convinced, for example, that

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:54.410
the members of the governing body have the heavenly calling.

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.329
After all, Jehovah has blessed them.

00:04:56.329 --> 00:05:00.370
They fulfill Bible prophecy about the faithful and discreet slave.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.689
There are certain things that we acquire knowledge about and we're convinced of.

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:06.930
We see Jehovah's favor on them.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.370
We have no doubt that Jehovah's blessing is upon their efforts to take care of the domestics

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:17.850
and provide spiritual food for all of us, but there's something we don't know.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.410
We have nothing to do with the final ceiling.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:28.170
That is a personal thing that takes place between the individual and Jehovah God.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:33.089
And as the comments on the text state, it takes place some time before the anointed one

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:39.410
dies faithful or before the outbreak of the great tribulation.

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.730
That's what we're told, and that's what we understand.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:48.089
And that's what's indicated in Revelation where it speaks of the final ceiling of the anointed.

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:53.089
And as our scripture text today says, the anointed and the other sheep make up one flock

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:54.889
under one shepherd.

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:59.250
We work together to do Jehovah's will to honor his name, and we're not seeking to make

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:05.850
a name for ourselves among men, among people, to get some type of personal glory about

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.329
what we do.

00:06:07.329 --> 00:06:13.730
It's an interesting account about Manoa, the man who became father to Samson, and the

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.170
angel that appeared to Manoa.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:20.850
Now, Manoa refers to the angel as the man of the true God.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.529
So his impression was it was a man that came from the true God to speak to his wife and

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:26.529
then to him.

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:32.449
He knew it wasn't Jehovah because Manoa had spoken to Jehovah God, and he requested

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:35.490
that Jehovah send the man of the true God again to him.

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:42.889
Well, let's see what took place in that account in judges 13 because we get a viewpoint

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:50.529
of what kind of attitude we want to have in connection with our service to God, Jehovah.

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:55.250
Judges chapter 13 verses 17 and 18.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:01.050
It says there then Manoa said to Jehovah's angel, what is your name so that we may honor

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:04.810
you when your word comes true.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:11.329
However, Jehovah's angel said to him, why are you asking about my name, seeing that it

00:07:11.329 --> 00:07:12.329
is a wonderful one.

00:07:12.329 --> 00:07:16.370
In other words, I'm not giving you my name.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.329
You don't need to know my name.

00:07:20.329 --> 00:07:23.730
That angel displayed modesty.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:29.490
And the other point, too, to keep in mind, Manoa's words reveal something to us.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:38.089
He wanted to know the angel's name in order to honor him when his word came true.

00:07:38.089 --> 00:07:41.490
Jehovah deserves the honor and it wasn't the angel's word.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:45.930
It was Jehovah's word by means of his messenger, the angel.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:51.129
So the angel was not about to take credit that belonged to Jehovah.

00:07:51.129 --> 00:07:54.970
And when you think about it, isn't that the way that the anointed and the other sheep,

00:07:54.970 --> 00:08:00.009
we look at things, we're not here to try and take credit for ourselves, some kind of

00:08:00.009 --> 00:08:01.529
glory among our brothers.

00:08:01.529 --> 00:08:07.930
No, we're here to honor Jehovah God, bring him praise.

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:12.769
Whatever we do in our sacred service is to honor Jehovah.

00:08:12.769 --> 00:08:17.209
And what about knowing at some point in the future, those who will be in the heavenly

00:08:17.209 --> 00:08:19.170
kingdom with Christ?

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:24.769
Well, the watchtower from which our text comments are taken says this.

00:08:24.769 --> 00:08:32.370
Psalm 87 verses 5 and 6 indicate that it is likely that in the future, the names of all those

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:37.250
who have been raised to rule with Jesus in heaven will be revealed.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.049
And then Romans is cited.

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:43.090
It speaks of the revealing of the sons of God, not directly in connection with revealing

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:45.970
their names, but that term is used there.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:52.409
And Psalm 87 verses 5 and 6 is cited referring to Zion and those born in her.

00:08:52.409 --> 00:08:57.690
And we know that those of the anointed receive their born again with the hope of everlasting

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.009
life.

00:08:59.009 --> 00:09:05.049
And they're born to Jehovah's heavenly, his wife, the heavenly organization to rule with

00:09:05.049 --> 00:09:08.210
Jesus Christ in the heavens.

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:12.610
So we don't need to know the names of every member of the anointed and follow each one

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:13.610
of them.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:15.009
That's not what we do.

00:09:15.009 --> 00:09:22.730
Jesus is our leader, and the Bible tells us we must follow only Him, Matthew 2310.

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:27.250
And there is a principle to keep in mind that's found at 2 Timothy 219.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:30.490
It applies to all the anointed and the other sheep.

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:33.490
It's a beautiful principle.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.409
And Jehovah knows those who belong to Him.
