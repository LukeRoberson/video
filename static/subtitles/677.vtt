00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:05.900
Jesus called the Apostle Paul a chosen vessel.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.900
He was among the most dynamic ministers who ever lived.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.900
But when he wrote his second letter to Timothy,

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.899
he was in prison bonds, which severely limited

00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:20.899
what he could personally do to spread the good news.

00:00:20.899 --> 00:00:24.899
But that situation did not dishearten him.

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:27.899
His letter refers to what others were doing.

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:31.899
Luke was there with him in Rome, but still free.

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:35.899
Aquila and Priscilla were still working hard in Ephesus.

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.899
He asked for Mark to come to assist him with the ministry

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.899
and of course he gave instructions to his beloved son Timothy.

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.899
But most important, notice what he said at 2nd Timothy 2

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:51.899
and verses 8 and 9.

00:00:51.899 --> 00:01:07.939
2nd Timothy 2 and verses 8 and 9.

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.939
Remember that Jesus Christ was raised up from the dead

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.939
and was David's offspring according to the good news, I preach,

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.939
for which I am suffering and being imprisoned as a criminal.

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.939
Nevertheless, the word of God is not bound.

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.939
Yes, Paul was in chains limiting what he could do,

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.939
but the word of God, the message that he and others

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:33.939
had been proclaiming was not bound.

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.939
It was alive. It was in the hearts of thousands of people

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:39.939
that they had preached to.

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:43.939
And it was to be recorded in countless copies of the scriptures

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:44.939
in time.

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:51.939
Once this message was unleashed, the power of it could never be bound again.

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.939
I'll just read Hebrews 4-12, the first part.

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.939
It connects with this scripture.

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.939
It says, for the word of God is alive and exerts power.

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.939
Now, on the 2nd expression exerts power,

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.939
the Greek word, according to the Kingdom Interlinear,

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:12.939
says that it is living an energetic.

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:17.939
In fact, we derive the English word energy from this word.

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:22.939
But the context shows both in Hebrews and in 2nd Timothy

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:27.939
that the word of God refers to the message or expression of God's purpose.

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:31.939
And of course, that message is closely connected to the Bible today

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:36.939
because that's the book that contains that message for us.

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:38.939
And through the centuries,

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:43.939
opponents have tried to lessen the power or energy of the Bible

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:45.939
in these three ways.

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:51.939
First, by removing God's name from copies of the Bible.

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:56.939
Second, by destroying copies of the scriptures in past centuries,

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:01.939
and more recently, by making it difficult to obtain in many languages.

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:09.939
And third, by means of inaccurate and inaccurate translation and dead language.

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:14.939
These three developments have been like a short circuit in an electric line.

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:19.939
The power is hindered from reaching its destination.

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:24.939
Jehovah's Organization has moved in the opposite direction on these three fronts.

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:29.939
And tonight, we're going to consider three roles of the New World translation

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:34.939
and ensuring that the power of Jehovah's Word is not bound.

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:38.939
First, by making God's name known, Earthwide.

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:43.939
Second, by making the scriptures freely available to all.

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:50.939
And third, by making God's message accurate, clear, and alive.

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:56.939
And we're also going to discuss the role of the worldwide Bethel family in this regard.

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:02.289
So first, we're going to consider the role of the New World translation

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:06.289
in making God's name known, Earthwide.

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:11.289
Before Christ's brothers began work on the New World translation in the 1940s.

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:14.289
English Bibles, like American Standard Version,

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:19.290
rather hams, and others had already restored the divine name in the Hebrew scriptures

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.290
based on the strong manuscript evidence that they found.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.290
Translations like the emphatic dialogue even used it in the Greek scriptures.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:35.290
But these translations were like the proverbial dead lion of Ecclesiastes 9.4.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.290
In the 1940s, people almost exclusively read the archaic King James Version

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.290
with its four occurrences of Jehovah's name.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.290
The first real challenge to the dominance of the King James Version in English

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.290
was the Revised Standard Version, which was published in 1952.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:00.290
But the Committee of that Version strongly rejected the American Standard Bible policy

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:05.290
of using the divine name, and they substituted it everywhere with Lord.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.290
And today almost all English Bibles follow that policy.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.290
There are a few exceptions, but this is the mainstream.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.290
In fact, here are the five best-selling English Bibles,

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.290
according to the Christian booksellers association.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.290
The total occurrences of the name Jehovah and these four Bibles

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.290
are the four occurrences in King James Version

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.290
plus the seven occurrences of Yahweh and the new living translation.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.290
There are no occurrences in any of the other three Bibles,

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:44.290
new international version, new King James Version, and English Standard Version.

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.290
That means that all of these popular Bibles say,

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:56.290
I am the Lord, that is my name, or the name of the Lord is a strong tower.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:02.290
Consider Exodus 6.3 in the popular, actually the best-selling, new international version.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.290
It's even past the King James Version.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:10.290
I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Almighty.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:16.290
But by my name, the Lord, I did not make myself fully known to them.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:20.290
There are four names here in the Hebrew text.

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:26.290
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the tetragremotant, Jehovah.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.290
Now a primary reason given in the revised Standard Version

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.290
and many other Bibles for substituting Lord

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.290
is because Jehovah is not the original pronunciation

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.290
or that it should be Yahweh.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.290
But the fact is we don't pronounce Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.290
the same way that the ancient Jews did.

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.290
We don't probably know exactly how they pronounced it.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.290
It may have varied over the centuries.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.290
But following their reasoning, their translation should say

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:07.290
I appeared to your forefather, and to his son, and to his grandson, as God Almighty.

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:13.290
But by my name, the Lord, I did not make myself fully known to them.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:18.290
Now this is obviously an unreasonable approach to translating the first three names.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.290
Don't you agree?

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.290
But that's exactly what they did with the fourth name.

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:28.290
They said we don't pronounce it the same way, so we're not going to translate it.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:32.290
But taking this even a step further, if they were so concerned

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:37.290
that Jehovah is not the exact pronunciation of God's name,

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.290
what about the name Jesus?

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:46.290
Acts 4-12 says there's no other name that has been given by which we must get saved.

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:50.290
So is its pronunciation equally important?

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:53.290
In fact, scholars don't even agree on whether Jesus

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:59.290
and his disciples spoke Hebrew or Aramaic, which would affect the pronunciation.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:05.290
Hebrew would be something like Yeshua, Aramaic, Yeshua, something like that.

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:10.290
But what about the poor Greek speaking disciples who didn't have the SH sound?

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:17.290
They said Jesus, but that was the form recorded in the inspired scriptures.

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:23.290
The most corrupted pronunciation is Jesus in English.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:27.290
It's nothing like they would have said it in the first century.

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:34.289
But that doesn't prevent its use some 900 times or even more in all of these Bibles.

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:41.289
So their position on removing God's name on the grounds of pronunciation is indefensible.

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:47.789
In legal terms, the legal department would call it a crime of omission.

00:08:47.789 --> 00:08:53.789
But the situation regarding God's name is the same and even worse in other languages.

00:08:53.789 --> 00:08:56.789
Well, you ask, how could it be worse?

00:08:56.789 --> 00:09:01.789
When God's name is substituted with the name of a local God,

00:09:01.789 --> 00:09:05.789
that was done with the Chichewa Bible in Malawi.

00:09:05.789 --> 00:09:08.789
This journal, it's called the Bible Translator.

00:09:08.789 --> 00:09:14.789
It sets policies for translators of the United Bible Society's worldwide.

00:09:15.789 --> 00:09:23.139
And it explains why Jehovah's name was replaced with the name Chauta.

00:09:23.139 --> 00:09:25.139
Here they give the reason.

00:09:25.139 --> 00:09:35.139
In this respect, the important revelation for Chaewa people today is that the foreign deity Yehovah is really Chauta.

00:09:35.139 --> 00:09:44.139
The God they've always known and worshipped and the God whom their ancestors also turned to for help in the time of trouble.

00:09:44.139 --> 00:09:47.139
It's incredible reasoning, isn't it?

00:09:47.139 --> 00:09:57.139
No wonder Archive Chaewa Bibles refused to use this Bible, though it was far easier to understand than their previous Bible.

00:09:57.139 --> 00:10:05.139
This is one of the so-called solutions found in this special issue of the Bible Translator from October 1992,

00:10:05.139 --> 00:10:09.139
on the topic, translating the names of God.

00:10:09.139 --> 00:10:14.139
And these policies are still current among translators today.

00:10:14.139 --> 00:10:19.139
The editor's opening comments give an idea of the direction given.

00:10:19.139 --> 00:10:32.139
It has become clear in recent years that no one's solution to the problems we face in translating the names of God will meet all situations.

00:10:32.139 --> 00:10:37.139
First, their wording gives the impression that God has a number of personal names.

00:10:37.139 --> 00:10:44.139
Also, these consultants frequently call it a problem because for them it is a genuine problem.

00:10:44.139 --> 00:10:49.139
They know that God's name is the most frequently occurring name in the whole Bible.

00:10:49.139 --> 00:10:52.139
It occurs thousands of times in the Hebrew text.

00:10:52.139 --> 00:10:56.139
And they also know why others include it in the Bible.

00:10:57.139 --> 00:11:08.139
In fact, on page 409 of this journal, there is a quote from the forward of the American Bible Society, of the American Standard Bible Society.

00:11:08.139 --> 00:11:21.139
This personal name, Jehovah, with its wealth of sacred associations, is now restored to the place in the sacred text to which it has an unquestionable claim.

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:24.139
And that's what the American Standard Bible did.

00:11:24.139 --> 00:11:28.139
And it sounds reasonable, but notice the conclusion.

00:11:28.139 --> 00:11:41.139
It cannot be denied that this American Standard View influenced the thinking of scores of evangelical missionaries who were sent out to various places in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

00:11:41.139 --> 00:11:48.139
Consequently, the name Jehovah was mistakenly introduced as a translation of the name of God.

00:11:48.139 --> 00:11:56.139
The name which would remain undisputed and be considered unchangeable for many years to come.

00:11:56.139 --> 00:11:59.139
So they viewed Jehovah as a mistake.

00:11:59.139 --> 00:12:06.139
They don't say Jesus was a mistake, even though as we saw the same pronunciation issues apply.

00:12:06.139 --> 00:12:11.139
But this so-called mistake led to an interesting situation.

00:12:11.139 --> 00:12:19.139
As they say, scores of Bibles were produced by those missionary translators, and they used the name thousands of times.

00:12:19.139 --> 00:12:28.139
But many of those missionaries who translated those Bibles were not native speakers, so their translations were often difficult to understand.

00:12:28.139 --> 00:12:40.139
In the latter half of the 20th century, translators like Eugene Nida led a movement to revise many of those older Bibles to make them more understandable.

00:12:40.139 --> 00:12:56.139
Nida, whom the New York Times refers to as the father of modern Bible translation, expresses his view about the divine name in his book, the theory and practice of translation.

00:12:56.139 --> 00:13:08.139
He says, there is a kind of divine ambiguity in the use of the same term to apply both to God and to Jesus Christ.

00:13:08.139 --> 00:13:19.139
Such statements are repeated in other references, for example, by consultants for the Wickliffe Bible Society.

00:13:19.139 --> 00:13:34.509
And they show the real reason why so-called Christian translators are so ready to omit the name Jehovah, because it creates confusion between Jehovah and his son, Jesus Christ.

00:13:34.509 --> 00:13:42.509
Because of these developments, brothers and fields like Chachewa, Hindi, Thai, and others were left with a choice.

00:13:42.509 --> 00:13:49.509
Either use a heart to understand Bible containing God's name, or a readable one that omitted the name.

00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:52.509
What do you think the brothers did?

00:13:52.509 --> 00:14:03.509
In almost every case, they chose the difficult Bible, even if it was harder for them to read and understand, because it had Jehovah's name in it.

00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:13.509
To understand the frustration, imagine this sister in India trying to explain why we are called Jehovah's Witnesses to this householder.

00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:27.509
She could read Isaiah 43-10, but if her Bible said, you are my witnesses, declares the Lord, she might have to explain in Hebrew there are four letters here that should say Jehovah.

00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:33.509
The woman might ask, what is Hebrew? What does Hebrew have to do with this?

00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:40.509
After explaining, she might ask our sister, so do you know Hebrew that you can explain this to me?

00:14:40.509 --> 00:14:54.509
Some brothers have been so frustrated that they would read Jehovah even when their Bible said, Lord, but when the householder would see that they're reading something different, they would become suspicious.

00:14:54.509 --> 00:14:59.509
But it's interesting talking about the context of India.

00:14:59.509 --> 00:15:13.509
This Bible translator has an article about the reaction in Christendom, not among our brothers, but in Christendom when Jehovah's name was replaced by the word Prabhu or Lord in Hindi and Nepali Bibles.

00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:17.509
The article entitled, what is his name?

00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:22.509
Translation of divine names in Indian languages explains.

00:15:22.509 --> 00:15:29.509
Not all Christians are happy with this solution, however. He's talking about Christians and Christendom.

00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:43.509
The first reason is an emotional one. The readers have been so used to reading and hearing the transliteration, Jehovah, that they have come to attach some kind of sacred significance to it or people.

00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:51.509
They have become so emotionally attached to the name that no amount of argument can make them change their minds.

00:15:51.509 --> 00:16:00.509
The second reason, as some Nepali Christians told me, they're often asked by Hindus for the name of the Christian God.

00:16:00.509 --> 00:16:07.509
The Hindus claim that all Hindu gods and goddesses have a personal name such as Ram, Krishna, Brahma.

00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:13.509
And when they know the names of the gods and goddesses, they can relate themselves to the deities.

00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:23.509
Now, since Prabhu or Lord can be used for husband, master, and God, Hindus will not accept it as being God's name.

00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:31.509
So he continues in his article, the Hindus are not interested in the title of God.

00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:40.509
They want to know the personal name of God. And unless they know the name, they cannot relate themselves to the one who bears it.

00:16:40.509 --> 00:16:43.509
Now, notice his conclusion.

00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:52.509
Having said all this, however, and having argued in favor of translating the name YHWH by Lord,

00:16:52.509 --> 00:16:59.509
I must concede that in the light of recent studies, a new approach may become necessary.

00:16:59.509 --> 00:17:09.509
That means that the last word has not been said on the question of rendering the tetragramaton in North Indian and other languages.

00:17:09.509 --> 00:17:14.509
And happily, this is the last statement we're going to read from the Bible translator.

00:17:14.509 --> 00:17:17.509
And it's the only one we agree with.

00:17:17.509 --> 00:17:23.509
In fact, the last word for some languages of India was spoken one month ago.

00:17:23.509 --> 00:17:34.509
On September 4th, 2016, a video of Brother Heard was broadcast throughout India in Sri Lanka and to brothers in other locations

00:17:34.509 --> 00:17:41.509
as he announced the release of the complete New World translation in Hindi, Malayalam and Tamil

00:17:41.509 --> 00:17:47.509
and the Christian Greek scriptures in Marathi and Telugu.

00:17:47.509 --> 00:17:55.509
The whole New World Bible was already available in Sinhala and the Greek scriptures in Kanada, Gujarati, Nepal and Punjabi.

00:17:55.509 --> 00:18:08.509
So our brothers in India, Nepal and Sri Lanka have all these Bibles available to make Jehovah's name known in that vast field of 1.3 billion people.

00:18:08.509 --> 00:18:22.720
Jehovah says at Ezekiel 38, 23, I will certainly magnify myself and sanctify myself and make myself known before the eyes of many nations.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.720
And they will have to know that I am Jehovah.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:37.720
Not that I am the Lord, not that I am Prabhu or Senior or Chauta but Jehovah.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:43.720
The undeniable trend in Bible translation worldwide is to omit God's name.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:55.720
And Jehovah is countering that by using the New World translation to figuratively unchain his people from Bibles that fail to honor and sanctify his name.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:11.990
And we're happy that 95% of our brothers in India and over 90% worldwide have a modern translation of at least the Christian Greek scriptures that uses the name Jehovah.

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:18.990
Second, we're going to discuss the role of the New World translation and making the scriptures freely available.

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:28.990
In the past, opponents like Roman Emperor Diocletian and the clergy of the Middle Ages gathered and burned copies of the scriptures.

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:36.990
The Bibles survived and copies are freely available in languages like English, French and Spanish and others.

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:43.990
But today, economic and copyright issues have made the Bible difficult to obtain in many languages.

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:51.990
The South American missionary wrote, the Bible society is translate into many Amerindian languages.

00:19:51.990 --> 00:20:00.990
But it seems like every new translation is just a trophy. It is translated, printed in a few copies and then forgotten.

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:09.990
Usually, these translations are expensive, complicated and simply not available to the people who need them.

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:21.990
It was made to translate the New World translation into a language of the Pacific because the only Bible had removed the divine name completely and it is not readily available.

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:29.990
Since only small quantities of this Bible were originally printed and it is not currently being reprinted.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:36.990
Yes, it's true that the Bible has been translated whole or in part into 2,800 and more languages.

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:40.990
It is readily available in just a fraction of those languages.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:51.990
And Bibles are especially poor in areas where the population doesn't have money to spend on Bibles. Printing is unprofitable.

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:55.990
And it's often in areas where we have great increases.

00:20:55.990 --> 00:21:14.400
In some languages, a Bible may cost up to a monthly salary and the copies that brothers get for their monthly salary are often missing pages, sometimes whole Bible books and sometimes they are just roughly bound photocopies.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:26.400
When a branch office tries to obtain Bibles that reduce cost or even offers to reprint the Bible in such languages, they are often rebuffed by the copyright holders.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:37.400
In Malawi, for example, our brothers were told not even to quote the Bible in our publications so that the sales of their Bible would not be threatened.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:46.400
Visitors to some African lands have been shocked to see over a hundred brothers sharing two or three Bibles in congregation.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:58.400
A brother wrote, most Chaluba-speaking brothers in Congo did not own a Bible. Each copy was passed around like a microphone when a read scripture was called.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:09.400
Otatella congregations in Congo often just had one or two copies. Brothers used to go to the Kingdom Hall to practice their talk on the Bible.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:21.710
Well, this makes these images of brother Lush in Congo releasing the Christian Greek scriptures in Chaluba, Congo, and Otatella even more meaningful.

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:29.710
This brother's reaction may seem dramatic to us, but it may have been his first personal copy of the Bible.

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:43.710
And you see this crowd carefully studying their new Bibles. I notice they're not comparing it with their previous copy, likely because for many of them there was no previous copy.

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:52.710
I think also if brothers had such a hard time getting a Bible, how easy would it be for a Bible student to get a copy?

00:22:52.710 --> 00:23:04.710
The Rwanda branch wrote that 18 Bibles students there in an isolated group hesitated to stop preaching, start preaching because no one in their group had a Bible.

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:14.380
When they received the Kenya Rwanda Christian Greek scriptures, they felt confident to begin their public ministry.

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:22.380
In other language fields where Bibles were scarce, scarce, they would not sell them to Jehovah's Witnesses, even if they had the money.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:33.380
When Kyrgyz brothers tried to buy Bibles at a religious bookstore, they would be asked, what is God's name? If they gave the answer, no Bible.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:43.660
Similar situations used to exist for Albanian, Isoko, Malagasy, Sotil, and many other fields.

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:52.660
Now that tables have turned in many of these places, the easiest way to get a Bible is to go visit a kingdom hall.

00:23:52.660 --> 00:24:00.660
An elderly man from the mountains of East Timor traveled down to the capital in search of a tattooed Bible.

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:11.660
The closest thing he could find was an Indonesian Bible at the store for $45 US dollars, two week salary for him, not even in his language.

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:15.660
The storekeeper said, you should go and find Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:21.660
Well, after searching all day that day and most of the next day, he finally found the brothers.

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:27.660
And he was delighted to receive Bibles, Bible literature, and also have a discussion with them.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:30.660
He said it was the answer to his prayers.

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:37.660
The brothers said he now sends text messages from the mountains with questions about what he's reading in his tattooed Bible.

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:49.970
A hilly guy known speaking, brother from Philippines wrote, people now ask, what will happen to your organization since you are freely distributing this Bible?

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:52.970
They're worried about us running out of money.

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:58.970
The usual answer, it is Jehovah's will to let all people know his name.

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:01.970
Do you think he will let the funds run out?

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:06.970
And the brothers say, always good conversations are generated from that.

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:13.970
It's true that the generous contributions of Jehovah's people in more prosperous lands make this possible.

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:16.970
But it also makes us think of Isaiah 551.

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:28.869
And let's turn there to Isaiah 551.

00:25:28.869 --> 00:25:31.869
Says there, come all you thirsty ones.

00:25:31.869 --> 00:25:33.869
Come to the water.

00:25:33.869 --> 00:25:36.869
You with no money, come by and eat.

00:25:36.869 --> 00:25:42.869
Yes, come by wine and milk without money and without cost.

00:25:42.869 --> 00:25:48.869
Now, if you read further in this chapter, it's clear that this is a messianic prophecy.

00:25:48.869 --> 00:26:02.869
And we have no doubt that Jesus Christ is the one orchestrating this campaign of distribution of millions of Bibles along with Bible literature to the poor and the humble people of the earth.

00:26:02.869 --> 00:26:09.869
He won't allow the power of God's word to be bound by economic or copyright issues.

00:26:09.869 --> 00:26:20.049
Next, we're going to discuss the role of the new world translation and making the Bible's message clear and alive.

00:26:20.049 --> 00:26:28.049
The existence of thousands of languages and their subtle differences is a natural obstacle to communication.

00:26:28.049 --> 00:26:33.049
To illustrate, a Brazilian Bethelite was asked where a visitor was.

00:26:33.049 --> 00:26:37.049
He responded, he passed away.

00:26:37.049 --> 00:26:43.049
When he saw the shocked reaction of the brother, he said, no, no, no, he passed out.

00:26:43.049 --> 00:26:45.049
The other brother was still concerned.

00:26:45.049 --> 00:26:49.049
And he finally pointed, he said, he went that way.

00:26:49.049 --> 00:26:54.049
Obviously, this brother struggled with the nuances of English.

00:26:54.049 --> 00:26:56.049
Now, think about Bible translation.

00:26:56.049 --> 00:27:04.049
It involves understanding the nuances of what was written thousands of years ago in ancient Hebrew,

00:27:04.049 --> 00:27:11.049
an aromatic and Greek, and translating those thoughts into English and hundreds of other languages.

00:27:11.049 --> 00:27:14.049
It is an enormous challenge.

00:27:14.049 --> 00:27:26.049
But remember that many Bibles previously used by our brothers were translated by individuals who knew that God's name was in the Bible and they refused to put it in the text.

00:27:26.049 --> 00:27:32.049
Now, imagine these same individuals believe that God and Jesus are the same person,

00:27:32.049 --> 00:27:35.049
or that the dead live on in heaven and hell.

00:27:35.049 --> 00:27:42.049
How do you think it affects their translation of difficult doctrinal passages?

00:27:42.049 --> 00:27:48.049
As an example, the traditional Thai Bible says that Ecclesiastes 9-10,

00:27:48.049 --> 00:27:59.480
there is no work nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom in ghost city where you are going.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:04.480
At Acts 227, the Chinese Union version says about Jesus,

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:10.480
you will not leave my spirit or it can be understood as ghost in the Yin world.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.480
That is the nether world.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:17.480
Now, this actually reflects what many Chinese people think happens to the dead.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:23.480
And it's why they offer food and objects that they think people will need in the Yin world.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:32.480
But it's interesting that even a word-by-word translation of the pre-2013 English New World translation was confusing in Chinese.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:43.480
The previous word for soul sounded like spirit ghost and Hades sounded like a geographical location like Haiti might sound to us.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:54.480
So saying you will not leave my one or soul ghost in Hades sounded like Jesus ghost was stuck in a place called Hades.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:59.480
The Chinese translators were the first to receive approval to say,

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:04.480
you will not leave me in the grave straight forward.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:10.480
This set of pattern almost all languages following the Chinese use this solution.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:15.480
Then in 2013, the English New World translation did the same.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:24.480
But translating such verses as ancient Bible writers understood them has lifted a huge burden from the shoulders of our brothers.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:33.730
They used to try to explain the correct meaning using a Bible that distorted the meaning.

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:37.730
But the need for clarity goes beyond doctrinal issues.

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:42.730
Let's consider the challenge of translating verses like Matthew 5 and verse 3.

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:56.339
It says there, happy are those conscious of their spiritual need for the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them.

00:29:56.339 --> 00:30:06.339
The original Greek literally says happy the poor as to the spirit which makes no sense in English or even in modern Greek.

00:30:06.339 --> 00:30:12.339
The English rendering beautifully expresses the idea of being aware of one's spiritual poverty.

00:30:12.339 --> 00:30:19.339
But since a word for word translation of the English or Greek is often impossible in other languages,

00:30:19.339 --> 00:30:26.339
Bible translation teams have submitted 37 questions on this verse alone.

00:30:26.339 --> 00:30:35.339
For example, is happy better expressed by elated, jubilant or blessed?

00:30:35.339 --> 00:30:41.339
Can conscious of be better expressed by recognize thirst for or hunger for?

00:30:41.339 --> 00:30:47.339
Saying belongs to them, the kingdom belongs to them sounds like they own the kingdom.

00:30:47.339 --> 00:30:52.339
Is that the idea or is it better to say meant for them?

00:30:52.339 --> 00:30:58.339
In the expression spiritual need is a problem in many languages.

00:30:58.339 --> 00:31:04.339
Translated literally it could sound like the philosophical need in some languages.

00:31:04.339 --> 00:31:09.339
In other languages like their need for wicked spirits or ghosts.

00:31:09.339 --> 00:31:18.339
One African trainer observed in many African languages there is only one vernacular equivalent for spiritual,

00:31:18.339 --> 00:31:24.339
wind, air, oxygen, gas and spiritism.

00:31:24.339 --> 00:31:30.339
So a literal translation is confusing and often gives a completely wrong meaning.

00:31:30.339 --> 00:31:35.339
It could sound like happy are those who know they need oxygen.

00:31:35.339 --> 00:31:44.339
So translation teams might test out many different variations before finalizing such a verse.

00:31:44.339 --> 00:31:48.339
Another example is Ecclesiastes 8.9.

00:31:48.339 --> 00:31:54.339
All of this I have seen and I applied my heart to every work that has been done under the sun,

00:31:54.339 --> 00:32:00.339
during the time that man has dominated man to his harm.

00:32:00.339 --> 00:32:04.339
Now we often focus on the part after the comma.

00:32:04.339 --> 00:32:09.339
But in languages where the heart is simply an organ of the body that doesn't think,

00:32:09.339 --> 00:32:13.339
saying applied my heart makes no sense at all.

00:32:13.339 --> 00:32:22.339
Saying under the sun gives a strange picture of things happening directly below where the sun is located at a certain time.

00:32:22.339 --> 00:32:31.339
So before even reaching the main point of the verse, there are a number of linguistic stumbling blocks that the translators have to address.

00:32:31.339 --> 00:32:36.339
In some languages like Hindi, this verse might read,

00:32:36.339 --> 00:32:44.339
all of this I have seen and I have paid attention to all the things happening in the world, not under the sun.

00:32:44.339 --> 00:32:52.339
And seen that during this time man has only brought problems to man by ruling over him.

00:32:52.339 --> 00:33:04.680
You can imagine each project involves a lot of research, long discussions and fervent prayer to ensure accurate and clear translation.

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:09.680
Now another issue that arises has to do with the language registry.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:17.680
Some think that Bible language should sound somehow loftier or holier than everyday language.

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:22.680
For centuries the Catholic Church kept the Bible in the dead Latin language.

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:31.680
Greek Orthodox clergyman today still chant the Bible in ancient Greek, a beautiful language that hardly anyone understands.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:36.680
And many are still enamored by the archaic King James Version.

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:40.680
And this kind of thinking has affected Bibles in other languages.

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:49.680
For example, a lot of the Bibles in India use sent terms that are derived from Sanskrit, the terms that people hardly know.

00:33:49.680 --> 00:34:00.680
The previous Maltese, Myanmar, Tui and Vietnamese Bibles all used among many others all use very difficult to understand vocabulary.

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:07.680
We're just using simple everyday language greatly enhances Bible reading.

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:13.679
For example, previous Thai Bibles use the literary royal style.

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:21.679
Now in Thai pronouns can take many forms depending on who is speaking and who is being spoken to.

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:29.679
For example, kings like David would require one pronoun, nobles another, the common people at different one, God a different one.

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:34.679
There are 17 different ways to say I in Thai.

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:39.679
If you could imagine and some of those ways are never used in everyday speech.

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:48.679
That's why one sister wrote and said, I like how the Thai New World translation uses pronouns that we use in daily life.

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:58.679
In Psalm 5, when David expressed his feelings to Jehovah using the pronoun I that we use, I can now see David as a real person

00:34:58.679 --> 00:35:02.679
and can feel how depressed David felt at that time.

00:35:02.679 --> 00:35:11.679
I read that chapter with a tear in my eye and felt like I was David expressing my feelings and problems to Jehovah.

00:35:11.679 --> 00:35:15.679
All that from using normal pronouns.

00:35:15.679 --> 00:35:26.679
The Armenia branch wrote prior to its release readers put lots of effort into understanding what they read from their archaic Armenian Bibles.

00:35:26.679 --> 00:35:30.679
Now they put that same effort into studying it.

00:35:30.679 --> 00:35:40.679
A Turkish Bible brother said about the New World translation in Turkish, the Apostle Paul especially, finally speaks understandable Turkish.

00:35:40.679 --> 00:36:00.000
Now the following video is going to show how the ASL Bible has enhanced Bible study for thousands of our deaf brothers and sisters.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
I would always think I want to be able to read the Bible from start to finish too.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000
I should read the Bible every day and so I decided to do just that.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.000
However, whenever I started I would read a bit and eventually stop.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.000
I would try again only to stop. I could never get far.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:27.000
It was very difficult to feel moved or to see Jehovah as a real person when reading the Bible in English.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000
Then something very special happened.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000
It was at a district convention in 2005. I'll never forget this.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:42.000
They announced that the Christian Greek scriptures would be translated into American sign language.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000
Everyone, including myself, was thrilled.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000
A few months later the Bible book of Matthew was released on DVD.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:58.000
I remember the first time putting the DVD into the player and watching the signer on the screen.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:10.000
I was astounded. I could see the facial expressions, the emotions, the signs all coming to life and helping me to understand what was being said in the Bible.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.000
I watched it all the way through again and again and again.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:22.000
And I would do this every time until another Bible book was released in ASL.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:28.000
The Bible presented in my language helps me to see Jehovah.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:38.000
I can see his love for me. I see him counseling me like a father. He encourages me, cherishes me.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:44.000
I can see all this not when I'm reading the Bible in English but in sign language.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000
I always think Jehovah for this gift.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:38:13.969
Her comments help us to see how Jehovah is fulfilling his word at Deuteronomy, chapter 30, and verses 13 and 14.

00:38:19.599 --> 00:38:23.599
Deuteronomy 30, 13 and 14.

00:38:23.599 --> 00:38:34.599
Nor is it on the other side of the sea so that you have to say who will cross over to the other side of the sea and get it for us so that we may hear it and observe it.

00:38:34.599 --> 00:38:43.599
For the Word is very near you in your own mouth and in your own heart so that you may do it.

00:38:43.599 --> 00:38:49.599
Previously, for many brothers to understand the Bible, it was like crossing the sea.

00:38:49.599 --> 00:38:54.599
It was such an effort in study and understanding what the Bible said.

00:38:54.599 --> 00:39:10.599
But now, with the new world translation in such an understandable style, it's penetrating people's hearts and enhancing the effect of God's Word on their mouth by making their preaching of the good news more effective.

00:39:10.599 --> 00:39:18.599
Jehovah today is ensuring that his inspired message is not bound by language differences.

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:30.230
Now, we're going to briefly consider the role of the worldwide Bethel family in this effort to produce the new world translation.

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:40.230
In 1989, the governing body established World Headquarters Department to support the new world translation development.

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:46.230
And at that time, it was available in 11 languages, whole or in part.

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:57.230
This chart shows that the number of languages will reach 148 by December of this year, including eight sign languages.

00:39:57.230 --> 00:40:09.230
And you see that the increases dramatic, especially since 2005, because that was the year that the governing body made Bible translation a higher priority.

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:17.230
Just in 2016, by the end of the year, we will have had 21 releases.

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:25.230
Over 500 Bethelites serve on some 100 Bible translation or revision teams.

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:33.230
As we saw, translators carefully study each verse to make sure that they get the right understanding and render it correctly.

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:38.230
So full-time staff at headquarters to field their questions.

00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:43.230
Over the years, more than 100,000 questions have been asked.

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:50.230
In 2015 alone, 8,500 questions were answered.

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:55.230
But besides Bible translators, outside readers review the text.

00:40:55.230 --> 00:41:00.230
Others do proofreading, composition, digital publishing.

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:08.230
Others in Thailand even created a beautiful new font for their Thai New World translation to make it easier to read.

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:16.230
Over the years, MEPs programming has developed a specialized computer system for Bible translation.

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:25.230
The US and Japan printeries have worked two and three shifts to make sure that release states are met, including that of the English revision.

00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:36.230
Bindry workers, for example, with this Thai Bible, they have to hand feed each copy of the Bible because of the extra pages needed to make the font big enough to be legible.

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:40.230
This Bible is over 2,300 pages.

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:43.230
It's much bigger than our English New World translation.

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:49.230
But the brothers in Japan willingly and happily do that for their Asian brothers.

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:53.230
Each Bible requires the United effort of hundreds.

00:41:53.230 --> 00:42:01.230
Each one has a story involving training, long hours, problem solving, and great sacrifices.

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:11.230
For example, an experienced translator and father of 10 was in his 60s when he was asked to work on the translation in his language.

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:17.230
He commuted two hours a day for years to work on that project.

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:31.230
Two elderly couples moved from their comfortable homes in central Europe to work and live on a basically construction site for years in barracks until their project was finished.

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:37.230
A brother in the final stages of Parkinson's disease checked every verse for accuracy.

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:41.230
These are just a few of the hundreds of examples we could mention.

00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:50.610
Like the Apostle Paul, languishing, and prison, many of us are now limited in what we can personally accomplish in Jehovah's service.

00:42:50.610 --> 00:43:02.610
But our worldwide Bethel family can feel great satisfaction to see God's word and publications based on it being made freely available throughout the earth.

00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:13.329
Jehovah is the one who confused the languages, but he foretold that his message would not be bound by languages.

00:43:13.329 --> 00:43:17.329
He is causing it to penetrate language barriers.

00:43:17.329 --> 00:43:21.329
A Hindi brother wrote about the recent release.

00:43:21.329 --> 00:43:25.329
My wife and I just read the book of Proverbs.

00:43:25.329 --> 00:43:31.329
It is very, very encouraging to hear Jehovah's voice in a tongue that touches our hearts.

00:43:31.329 --> 00:43:36.329
I previously felt as if the Bible was covered by a net.

00:43:36.329 --> 00:43:41.329
Though we were able to read it, we could not see everything clearly.

00:43:41.329 --> 00:43:46.329
Now I feel as if everything is happening right before my eyes.

00:43:46.329 --> 00:43:54.329
A Tamil reader said, thank you for completely changing our opinion that the Bible can never be understood.

00:43:54.329 --> 00:43:59.329
And in fact, for making it so easily understandable.

00:43:59.329 --> 00:44:07.329
A Rwandan witness said, I now understand the feelings of Jehovah and of persons mentioned in the Bible.

00:44:07.329 --> 00:44:14.329
Jehovah now speaks Kinyarwanda, and it seems that the Hebrews were Rwandans.

00:44:14.329 --> 00:44:22.179
Such comments make all the hard work of the translators worthwhile.

00:44:22.179 --> 00:44:27.179
Now let's read Philippians chapter 2 and verse 13.

00:44:27.179 --> 00:44:54.579
Philippians 2.13 says, for God is the one who for the sake of His good pleasure energizes you, giving you both the desire and the power to act.

00:44:54.579 --> 00:45:03.579
This reminds us of Paul's words in Hebrews 4.12, where it said that the word of God is alive and energetic or exerts power.

00:45:03.579 --> 00:45:09.579
But the difference here in Philippians is that God Himself is the subject of the sentence.

00:45:09.579 --> 00:45:17.579
He is the one who exerts power. He is the one that provides the energy and the motivation to His people.

00:45:17.579 --> 00:45:29.579
And there is no doubt that Jehovah is the one who energized and moved his anointed servants to embark on this campaign of Bible translation and distribution.

00:45:29.579 --> 00:45:33.579
He has also energized members of the great crowd to support that work.

00:45:33.579 --> 00:45:36.579
And what has been the result?

00:45:36.579 --> 00:45:43.579
First, millions of Jehovah's people daily use a Bible that honors His name.

00:45:43.579 --> 00:45:58.579
Second, God's people have been given the energy and motivation to distribute Bibles and Bible literature so that even the poor are hearing the good news in harmony with Matthew 11.5.

00:45:59.579 --> 00:46:09.579
And third, Jehovah is breaking the language barrier so that His people are enjoying unprecedented clarity in their Bible study.

00:46:09.579 --> 00:46:18.579
And we're especially grateful to have all the new Bibles and revisions based on the simple, clear 2013 revision.

00:46:18.579 --> 00:46:31.309
It is exciting to see how Jehovah is already using the new world translation to communicate His will to millions of His sheep in over 140 languages.

00:46:31.309 --> 00:46:44.309
The result of this great effort has been enhanced spirituality, unity of thought as an organization, and a powerful tool to carry on the greatest preaching campaign in history.

00:46:45.309 --> 00:46:55.309
We can't help but echo the words of Psalm 113, this has come from Jehovah and it is wonderful in our eyes.

00:46:55.309 --> 00:47:05.309
We now look forward to see how Jehovah will use this translation to sanctify His great name before all of Earth's population.

00:47:05.309 --> 00:47:15.309
Yes, we're grateful to Jehovah for the new world translation, a translation that strengthens our conviction that the power of His Word can never be bound.
