00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:15.330
When I was 18, my family moved to a new city.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:23.010
It was bad enough leaving my friends behind, but now I wasn't sure if I could make new

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.550
ones.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.670
My parents seemed really happy.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:40.649
I didn't want to make them feel bad by telling them how I really felt.

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:53.710
The new school wasn't much better until I met Cameron.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:00.200
He seemed like a pretty cool guy.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:09.060
Soon, his friends became my friends.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.859
He actually proved it by the association that he closest friendships recorded in the

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:24.540
scriptures.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.579
Kill, you were texting in the meeting.

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:29.420
I shouldn't have sent the text.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.739
I'm sorry.

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:34.700
But Cameron is a good person.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.099
He might even study one day.

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:39.140
I understand that I kill.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.859
But we all have to be careful with how much time we spend with people that don't love

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:43.859
Jehovah.

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:47.140
See, their values are just different.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.459
You know what prowess 13, 20 says?

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:51.939
Walk with those who are wise.

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.780
So why don't you seek out friends who love Jehovah?

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.299
And you will make friends that last a lifetime.

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.939
How am I supposed to do that?

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.540
There's no one my age in the congregation.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.260
I kill good friends can come from unexpected places.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.219
Mom, I had good friends.

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:16.039
Back home.

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:27.750
We all felt bad that night.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.629
The next day, Cameron posted pictures of a party he had.

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:38.780
My parents were right.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.659
I broke off my association with Cameron and his friends.

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:49.370
But I still felt lost.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.370
Hi.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.330
Akeel, do you have field service plans for Saturday?

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.330
Ah, no.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.330
Good.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.330
Now you do.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.330
I'll see you at the 930 meeting.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:18.389
OK?

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:26.030
After service, Max had the group over for refreshments.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.030
Did you take these?

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.069
Do you like them?

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.469
Yeah.

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:32.789
My wife, she was always the photographer.

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:35.430
She loved photography.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.310
And then one anniversary, she went out and bought me a camera.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.740
And from that moment on, I was hooked too.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.740
Even fly so quickly, it's hard to believe she passed away 12 years ago now.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:49.740
I'm sorry.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.539
It's OK.

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:52.939
But you still take pictures?

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:53.939
I do.

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:55.340
I really enjoy photography.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.900
There's something about being close to Jehovah's creation.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.340
It reminds me that we're never really alone.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.860
You know?

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:18.180
Good friends can come from unexpected places and unexpected ages.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:26.019
As I spent more time with Max, I realized it was just like David and Jonathan.

00:04:26.019 --> 00:04:33.399
Their friendship was based not on age, but on their love for Jehovah.

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:40.939
And they helped each other.

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:47.339
And with Max's help, I was able to keep a good spiritual routine without interruption.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.259
Although we weren't the same age, Max became my good friend.

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:56.819
I just needed to see what was right in front of me.
