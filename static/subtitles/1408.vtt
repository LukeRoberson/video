00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:24.649
They seemed nice.

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:28.649
I knew what Yuri was thinking.

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.649
I wanted to start a conversation,

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:34.649
but I didn't want to bother them either.

00:00:34.649 --> 00:01:00.509
And when an opportunity came, I just froze.

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:02.509
Then I was in a rush to give a witness.

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:18.629
It felt forced.

00:01:18.629 --> 00:01:28.579
It helped to hear that with all been there,

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.579
our past experiences were similar.

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:41.489
Whenever we didn't put pressure on ourselves

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:45.489
and just looked for something in common to talk about,

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:47.489
we could usually find a moment

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:50.489
when we could say something about the Bible.

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:53.489
She was curious why we were dressed up.

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:59.930
Turns out that she'd never talked to Jehovah's Witnesses before.
