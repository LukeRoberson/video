00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:08.269
As our commenters bring out, our focus today is on something that is actually very private

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:10.669
and perhaps very sensitive.

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:14.269
And that is our motives.

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.670
Motives do out deep within our figurative hearts.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:26.190
They really are described as the impaling force behind our conduct and decision-making.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.230
But today our text puts us on alert about these motives.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.350
And we need to have Jehovah's viewpoint of them.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.670
Let's consider the full scripture.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.770
Open your Bibles, please, to Proverbs chapter 16 and verse 2.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.530
We're alerted to this because as we already discussed, the motives are impaling force.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.570
They can help us do what is right in God's eyes, but also it can deceive us into doing

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.570
what is wrong.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.450
Notice what the Bible says about this.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:11.090
Proverbs 16 2 says, all of man's ways seem right to him, but Jehovah examines the motives.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.090
Interesting.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.170
We could set a very good goal for ourselves, be involved in what appears to be very good

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.890
things.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.530
But as the Bible says, our ways or our thoughts may appear good, but Jehovah examines

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.530
them.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:33.049
And he sees that our motives are not pure or not in total harmony with his will.

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:40.290
Well, we could meet up with his disapproval and even sharp judgment.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.730
How then can we make sure that our motives are pure and that they are pleasing to Jehovah

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.730
God?

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.890
In order to understand that, we have to understand our hearts because this is where our motives

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.010
reside in our figurative hearts.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.769
And an important aspect of our hearts is brought out for us.

00:01:58.769 --> 00:02:01.810
A Jeremiah chapter 17 and verse 9.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.170
Remember it says there that the heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.650
who can know it.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:13.370
You see, our imperfect figurative hearts are inherently selfish.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.650
It thinks there's only one thing and that is itself.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.569
And our hearts could deceive us into justifying errors on our part or even justify self-seeking

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:31.610
actions using even Jehovah's service for our own personal benefit.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.530
Now, this is a dangerous thing.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.129
A case in point is brought out for us.

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:42.969
If you look at the cross reference to the scripture at 1 Samuel chapter 15 verses 13

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:46.810
and 14, in fact, let's open our Bibles to that portion of scripture.

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:54.449
It's the account of King Saul and Jehovah God gave King Saul a very definite directions

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:56.449
on what he wanted him to do.

00:02:56.449 --> 00:03:02.330
That is, completely annihilate the Amalakites from the greatest to the least of them.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.770
He was to get rid of them.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.090
Now, we look at verses 5 through 7.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.770
We see that Saul took on this assignment and he was doing rather well.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.650
He was doing exactly what Jehovah had told him to do and that is annihilate the Amalakites.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:22.250
But in verse 9, we see something went wrong, something changed.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.449
In verse 9, it says, however, Saul and the people spared Egy, who was the King, and the

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:32.409
best of the flock, the herd, the fattened animals, the rams, and all that was good.

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:37.729
They did not want to devote them to destruction, but all the goods that were worthless to

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:42.090
and unwanted, well, these they devoted to destruction.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.370
So we see something happened here.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:52.330
Saul developed or had his motives for one point only using Jehovah's service, this commission

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.969
to do what?

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:57.370
To glorify himself, to benefit himself.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.770
In fact, if you look in verse 12, he even went so far to go to Carmel and erected a monument

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:10.250
to himself, glorifying this great victory that he performed over the Amalakites, bringing

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.729
King A. gag back with him as perhaps a trophy to show everyone that he dominated this

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:22.209
nation, got rid of them, and enriched himself by these beautiful animals that would no doubt

00:04:22.209 --> 00:04:25.689
benefit the herds that they had.

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:29.800
Well, was Jehovah fooled by this?

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.800
Obviously not.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.800
Jehovah saw right through it.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.800
He saw right to the core of the matter that Saul's motives were not pure.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.720
And so when he sent Samuel to the camp, he told Samuel to help him.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.680
He's been basically condemned, ripping the rulership away from him and no longer was

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.120
he pleasing to Jehovah God.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.560
Saul though, before he heard this denunciation from Jehovah, thought he was still in good

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:01.199
stead with God and putting on a big show of being a servant of God, a faithful man.

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:02.519
He said in verse 13,

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:05.480
May Jehovah bless you when he saw Samuel.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:15.029
I have carried out the word of Jehovah, and Samuel said him straight, I know you didn't.

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:17.149
You were lying.

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:21.310
You were seeking your own glory and not Jehovah's glory.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.149
Well, what can we learn from this account?

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:30.230
It's a very good account to have in mind because it's a sharp contrast or an acute example

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.509
of what we're discussing here today about motives.

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:38.629
We see that Saul's motives were not pure.

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:41.829
He was not putting Jehovah first in his life.

00:05:41.829 --> 00:05:48.589
And in fact, his impure motives moved him to an unfaithful course with God and meeting

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:53.269
up with his strong judgment against him.

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:59.670
How can we avoid making such a terrible mistake and succumb to, perhaps, impure reasonings

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.670
or motives that we might have in our hearts?

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:07.230
How can we even know it, as the Bible says, that it's there?

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:12.430
What Jehovah does help us read our motives and understand what's going on.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:17.629
And Hebrews chapter 4 and verse 12, we can see that he's Jehovah has given us an am marvelous

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:20.949
tool to do that.

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:21.949
It says,

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:27.029
For the word of God is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two-edged sword

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:31.910
and pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints from the marrow and

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:38.189
is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart.

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:43.189
So it's no wonder that we are giving strong abmunition from the faithful slave to read

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:51.310
God's word the Bible every day because it's by means of this amazing tool that can pierce

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:57.829
through and slice through the hard shell of our inf figurative, imperfect hearts to reveal

00:06:57.829 --> 00:07:03.470
what's really there and then to do something about it.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:09.029
You see, as we learned in this past week's Watchtower, what a wonderful article it was

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:13.750
and what beautiful guidance it gave us about how to gain strength from God's word but

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:20.189
also how to accomplish this very difficult assignment, if you will, of knowing what's

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:21.949
in our hearts.

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:26.709
Here we were told that before we read God's word that we should pray, ask Jehovah's

00:07:26.709 --> 00:07:32.310
Spirit to guide and direct us and then after reading it, imagine that we are there in

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:37.149
the very account that we're reading in the shoes of the ones that we're talking about,

00:07:37.149 --> 00:07:40.029
meditate on these things.

00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:46.069
Understand what is truly going on in our hearts, how does this information apply to me personally

00:07:46.069 --> 00:07:49.829
and then apply what we learn?

00:07:49.829 --> 00:07:54.470
When you see by doing that, well, then we can not only reveal what's going on inside

00:07:54.470 --> 00:08:02.269
of our hearts, but then we can take steps to correct our motives if they need correcting.

00:08:02.269 --> 00:08:08.509
Perhaps as young brothers, we desire to reach out for service as a privilege and a congregation

00:08:08.509 --> 00:08:13.310
and it's a wonderful thing to be reached out to be a ministerial servant, to be an elder,

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:18.990
but what are the true motives that why do we want this assignment?

00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:23.430
This is where following this four-step procedure that we learn can help.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:28.750
Why not read all the qualifications that a ministerial servant or an elder should have, meditate

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:34.389
upon them, apply these things into our life and ask ourselves, why do I really want to

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:37.509
be a servant in the congregation?

00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:44.029
Is it to glorify myself, to promote myself, or to actually do the work?

00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:49.389
Even ourselves being Timothy or Paul, or other faithful men mentioned in the Bible who

00:08:49.389 --> 00:08:54.190
were expended themselves, poured themselves out on behalf of God's people, and in doing

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:59.669
Jehovah's will, even perhaps being looked down upon both by those in the congregation

00:08:59.669 --> 00:09:05.070
as well as in the outside, are we willing to do that?

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:09.590
Actually all of us who desire theocratic assignments should go through this kind of procedure

00:09:09.629 --> 00:09:16.710
to make sure that our hearts are motives, really, are in harmony with Jehovah's will

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:22.549
for this assignment as well as what he wants for us.

00:09:22.549 --> 00:09:28.549
During this we'll perhaps maybe find that we may be harbing a soul-like motive

00:09:28.549 --> 00:09:35.950
and perhaps wanting to use Jehovah's service for self-interest and to promote ourselves.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:41.190
I think it's interesting, several years ago back in 2016 at the Remain Loyal to Jehovah

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:46.909
Convention, perhaps you recall the symposium avoid what erodes loyalty, and there they

00:09:46.909 --> 00:09:52.110
give the experience of the one of an elder who was taking the lead, how he was revealed.

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:57.629
His motives were revealed by some counsel that an elder had given him, and he saw that

00:09:57.629 --> 00:10:00.269
he was not responding correctly.

00:10:00.269 --> 00:10:01.909
So what did he do?

00:10:01.909 --> 00:10:03.990
He prayed to Jehovah.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:09.389
And then he took on assignments in the congregation that no one else saw, working after hours perhaps

00:10:09.389 --> 00:10:14.629
when someone was at the kingdom hall, doing things that would not put him in the limelight,

00:10:14.629 --> 00:10:21.190
yet they were necessary work that needed to be done to carry out God's will on purpose.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:24.029
This eventually changed his heart.

00:10:24.029 --> 00:10:28.070
And as we understand from that video, when that brother was in the basement taking the

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:33.669
lead with the brothers there, it actually saved his life to make these changes and

00:10:33.669 --> 00:10:40.309
helped and Jehovah used him to appropriately shepherd the flock during the great tribulation.

00:10:40.309 --> 00:10:45.070
Well that's a good example for us, that's what we want to do, and we can.
