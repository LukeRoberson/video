00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.849
When we think of unity, the words of Psalm 133-1 may come to mind. Let's read them.

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:12.609
Now, the words aren't going to be on the screen, so let's look them up in the Bible.

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:20.289
I'll give you a moment. That's Psalm 133 and verse 1.

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:21.589
It says,

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:29.570
Look, how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity.

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:34.609
Well, we certainly agree with these words of David.

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:39.170
Now, speaking of David, he knew the value of unity.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.369
And we may remember that he didn't always get to experience it in his own life.

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:48.450
The beginning and the end of his reign were marked by civil war,

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.969
the fairy opposite of unity.

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.609
But you'd think it would have been easy for the Israelites to remain united.

00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:01.409
After all, they came from the same roots. They were all children of Abraham.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:09.329
They spoke a common language, Hebrew. And they came from a similar social background.

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:15.090
The ancestors had all been slaves in Egypt, so there was no business for anybody to rag about

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.090
his heritage. Still, the Israelites found reasons to hate one another.

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:26.450
Israel's first king was from Benjamin. Its second king was from Judah.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.090
That was reason enough to start a war in Israel.

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:34.689
Let's fast forward now to the first century.

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:40.930
Unity is so important that it was on Jesus' mind on the night before he died.

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:45.730
You remember, he prayed to his father that his disciples might be one,

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.489
just as he and the father are one.

00:01:50.769 --> 00:01:55.090
Now that could have been a challenge. Why do we say that?

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.689
From a human standpoint, there was no reason for Jesus' disciples to be united.

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:05.250
Unlike the Israelites, they did not have a common ancestor.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.370
They did not have a common mother tongue. And they came from a variety of social backgrounds.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.250
Think of it. The first Christians were Jews or Jewish proselytes.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.330
Growing up, they were taught that Gentiles were unclean and they wouldn't even enter the

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:31.139
home of a Gentile, let alone preached to one. As for Gentile Christians, they came from every

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:36.819
nation under heaven. Most of them knew nothing of the Hebrew language or the Hebrew scriptures.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:44.020
They'd worshipped false gods. Some had been highly educated in Athens, Alexandria,

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.620
or some other center of worldly wisdom. Others had little formal education.

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:56.580
Yet when they accepted the truth, Christians became united and it peaceed with one another.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:05.460
The Apostle Paul wanted to help them to safeguard that bond of peace. Now that's the theme of our

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.740
discussion this morning. And we're going to look at his words recorded at Ephesians chapter 4

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:21.060
verses 3 to 6. And we're going to focus in on a particular expression in these verses.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:28.659
This is Ephesians chapter 4. I'll give you a moment. Ephesians chapter 4 and we're going to read

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:39.539
verses 3 to 6. Now Paul is interested in unity here, so let's see how he frames his discussion.

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:47.539
He says, earnestly and devoring, so an effort is involved, earnestly and devoring,

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:57.539
to maintain the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace. One body there is,

00:03:57.539 --> 00:04:03.699
and one Spirit, just as you were called to the one hope of your calling, and many emphasizes,

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:14.740
one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all. Now let's go back to verse 3 and look

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:24.579
at the expression the uniting bond of peace. So our discussion is safeguard the uniting bond of peace.

00:04:24.579 --> 00:04:29.620
Now the study Bible has an interesting note on that expression. It tells us that the word

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:40.100
translated uniting bond can also be translated ligament, ligament, and it is translated ligament in

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:46.500
other verses. Now we know what a ligament is. It's a band of strong tissue that holds our

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:55.220
bones together. So when we talk about the uniting bond of peace, we mean that peace is the ligament.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:02.819
It's the tissue that holds God's people together. That was true in the first century, and it's true

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:10.339
today. Like the early Christians, we come from different backgrounds. We speak different languages.

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:15.620
Yet Jehovah has shown us how to remain united and at peace.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:24.180
Now let's explain what we mean by being united to be united. Does it mean that we all have to

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.939
like the same things or we all have to think the same on every subject? There's room for a variety

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:36.420
of tastes and opinions. There's variety on this convention program. We don't all wear the same

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:44.819
style of suit or have the same color of tie. What about you? What's your favorite color?

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:54.899
Your favorite food. Your favorite pet. In Jehovah's organization, there are dog lovers and cat

00:05:54.899 --> 00:06:02.019
lovers, and not everyone likes the same breed of dog or cat. Have you ever visited someone who has

00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:07.540
a pet that he thinks is just adorable? You take one look at the animal and you wonder how

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:14.980
anyone could love a face like that. Yet he does. People are different, and their pets are

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:23.389
grateful for that. The variety we find among God's people today will continue on into the new world.

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:31.709
Jehovah loves variety. How many colors are there? How many species of plants, birds, and animals?

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:38.189
Among God's creation, we find the simple and the complex, the plain and the fancy,

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:46.189
the sweet and the sour, the rough and the smooth. There's great variety among people,

00:06:46.829 --> 00:06:53.389
even in the new world. Perfect humans won't have the same personality, talents, and abilities.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:59.550
You've always wanted to play the violin. Don't think when you're perfect you'll just be able to

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:05.709
pick up a violin and play, and there's no guarantee you'll be able to play in an orchestra.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:15.230
Now, one way to maintain unity is to respect the conscience of others. This is very important,

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:22.029
because very often when unity is disturbed, it's because we don't respect the ability of other

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:27.629
brothers and sisters to decide things for themselves. Now, what do we mean by the conscience?

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:37.629
Let's be simple. It's the faculty that helps us determine right from wrong. I'm going to repeat that.

00:07:37.629 --> 00:07:46.189
The conscience is the faculty to determine right from wrong. Now, let's consider how our

00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:51.870
upbringing and our culture can help shape our personal view of right and wrong.

00:07:52.829 --> 00:07:59.870
In some cultures, there are large families. Conversation around the dinner table is loud. You can

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:06.189
hardly hear yourself think. The children tease one another and don't hesitate to ask each other

00:08:06.189 --> 00:08:14.350
personal questions. The girls borrow each other's clothes, sometimes without asking. Some people would

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:20.189
say that's wrong. Put the girls to do nothing wrong with it and neither do their parents. In other

00:08:20.189 --> 00:08:27.149
cultures, family members are polite and courteous, but they don't talk much about their plans or

00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:34.350
their feelings. The parents don't often talk about their past because they value their privacy.

00:08:35.629 --> 00:08:41.789
Now, some who were raised that way tend to be rather strict with themselves and others. They have

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:48.269
definite views of right and wrong. Borrow their clothes without asking and they'll say,

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:54.590
that's stealing. I'm calling the elders. There are no gray areas with them.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:59.950
Now, there are lots of exceptions and we're not saying that everyone in a certain culture fits

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:07.230
the bill, but you get the idea. Now, what do you suppose happens when a publisher from one

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:13.389
culture moves into a congregation where the other culture predominates? If he doesn't adjust

00:09:13.389 --> 00:09:21.070
his way of viewing others, he'll be miserable. Is one way right and the other wrong? No. Members

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:28.190
of both cultures could learn from one another. Speaking of culture, we might ask ourselves,

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:32.590
how do I feel about brothers and sisters who come from cultures that are very different from

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:40.750
my own? Let me speak with an accent. Their style of dress may be different. Their manners and

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:47.470
food may not be what we're used to. Suppose that an elder is younger than we are or from a different

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:56.429
race. Will we accept his counsel? Will we ask him for counsel? Or will we look for an elder

00:09:56.429 --> 00:10:03.629
who's older and from a similar background? Will we celebrate our differences or will we allow them

00:10:03.629 --> 00:10:11.950
to disturb our unity? So that's one thing, but let's talk about our personal history. Our

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:18.669
personal history can also affect our view of right and wrong. Some grew up in a household where

00:10:18.669 --> 00:10:28.029
alcohol was a problem. Home was not a happy place and as adults, they stay as far away from alcohol

00:10:28.029 --> 00:10:35.389
as they can. And they take a dim view of anyone who uses it even in moderation. To them,

00:10:36.029 --> 00:10:42.750
it's just plain wrong to drink. Others have only good memories of their childhood home.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:50.899
At supper time, there was always wine on the table, but nobody ever abused it. A person who left

00:10:50.899 --> 00:10:57.220
behind an immoral lifestyle might be extremely sensitive about choices of clothing. He may

00:10:57.379 --> 00:11:01.620
be troubled by a clothing style that other brothers and sisters find totally acceptable.

00:11:03.299 --> 00:11:08.259
If they're not careful, those who tend to be strict with themselves could impose their

00:11:08.259 --> 00:11:16.500
conscience on others. Now let's consider a familiar scenario. Four publishers are working rural

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:22.820
territory in a car group. Now each home is separated from the next by many miles or kilometers.

00:11:23.779 --> 00:11:28.820
At the first call, the driver and her companion get out and the other sisters stay in the car

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:33.700
that have no choice. There's no place to go. Now the householder has many questions,

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:41.700
and a Bible study is started. It's noon when the two publishers return to the car. All smiles.

00:11:43.059 --> 00:11:49.299
You know what's coming next, don't you? One of the sisters in the back seat says,

00:11:49.379 --> 00:11:56.659
well, the two of us can't count any time this morning. What's she done? She's spoken for herself

00:11:57.379 --> 00:12:03.059
and for her companion. And unintentionally, she's imposed her own conscience on her friend.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:08.659
Now she doesn't want to count any time, that's her business. It would be best if she kept

00:12:08.659 --> 00:12:15.860
her business to herself. If you've ever visited a foreign country and gone on a guided tour,

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:20.980
probably one of the things the tour guide wanted to show you was the architecture inside a church.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:26.179
Now some brothers have no problem entering a church if it's part of a tour because to them

00:12:26.179 --> 00:12:32.500
it's no different from visiting a museum. Others, who were strong supporters of false religion,

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:39.139
couldn't enter a church for any reason, not even to attend a wedding or a funeral. To them,

00:12:39.139 --> 00:12:46.500
it's just plain wrong. Contrances can differ in this respect and we have to respect that,

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:50.419
we have to acknowledge that and we're going to expand on that idea in a moment.

00:12:52.019 --> 00:12:57.779
Well, we've hardly scratched the surface when it comes to describing the variety of personalities

00:12:57.779 --> 00:13:07.220
and viewpoints in Jehovah's organization. So here's the question, how can we maintain our unity?

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:16.419
Remember what Paul said, earnestly endeavoring to maintain this perfect bond of unity.

00:13:17.139 --> 00:13:23.779
It means that we have to put forth effort to maintain that unity. Well, first of all,

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:29.779
it'll help a lot to get well acquainted with brothers and sisters who think differently from us.

00:13:29.779 --> 00:13:35.779
Get to know their background. That'll help you to not to over-react when they take a position

00:13:35.779 --> 00:13:41.940
that we don't agree with. It'll help us not to judge them. Now, Paul wrote very plainly on that

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:51.149
subject in the words found at Romans chapter 14 and verse 4. Simple statement, but very powerful.

00:13:51.149 --> 00:13:55.149
Let's check it out together. Romans chapter 14, I'll give you a moment.

00:13:56.909 --> 00:14:06.399
And verse 4. Paul writes, who are you to judge the servant of another?

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:16.559
To his own master, he stands or falls. Indeed, he will be made to stand for Jehovah can make him stand.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:25.279
Now, let's go back and look at that for a sentence again. Who are you to judge the servant of another?

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:35.519
We know what a judge does. He declares someone guilty or not guilty. That's not our job. Jehovah is the judge.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:42.480
If each of us concentrates on his own thinking and his own conscience, the peace and unity of the

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:51.120
congregation will be preserved. Well, we all want to be balanced when we determine what is right

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:57.440
and what is wrong. We want to have a balanced view of things, a good conscience. So, how can we be

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:04.159
balanced when determining whether something is right or wrong? Now, in some cases, it's easy. The

00:15:04.159 --> 00:15:11.120
Bible tells us, but in other cases, there's no clear answer. Let's consider a scenario we touched

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:17.279
on earlier, the matter of entering a church. Now, that may not be a problem where you live,

00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:22.960
but in some places, it's a real issue. And remember, these talks are for our worldwide

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:28.559
brotherhood. So, we're going to consider a subject that will be a real problem for our

00:15:28.559 --> 00:15:33.120
menager overcome, and we hope that they will benefit from it. So, here's the scenario.

00:15:34.159 --> 00:15:39.759
Two different sisters are married to men who are not in the truth. Now, in both cases,

00:15:39.759 --> 00:15:47.039
the husband's mother has died. The funeral will be in a church. One sister decides to go.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.960
The other decides against it. The sister who decides to attend has considered that in that

00:15:54.960 --> 00:16:01.279
church, there will just be a talk by a clergyman. There will be no congregation singing, congregation

00:16:01.279 --> 00:16:06.799
prayers, or religious gestures. She was never very religious anyway, so none of that would mean

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:14.399
anything to her. And her husband and his family will be happy if she just sits quietly until it's over.

00:16:16.159 --> 00:16:21.039
Now, the second sister has a different set of circumstances. The service in that church

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:26.879
involves participation by the congregation. She used to be an active member of that church,

00:16:26.879 --> 00:16:33.600
and she's afraid she'll do something she'll regret. Her husband's family get very emotional at

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:40.000
funerals, and they're likely to make a scene if she doesn't participate. So, she respectfully

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.759
tells her husband that her attendance could cause him embarrassment and declines to attend.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:54.720
You can see that each situation is different. Now, we're going to discuss four questions that we

00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:01.759
might ask ourselves when we're called upon to make any difficult decision. And I will repeat the

00:17:01.759 --> 00:17:08.400
question, because if you're taking notes, you may want to write at least the question down. These

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:14.240
are very, very good questions that we can ask ourselves before we make a difficult decision. Are

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:25.839
you ready? Here's number one. What will make Jehovah happy? I'll repeat that. What will make

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:34.160
Jehovah happy? Now, that should be our main concern to please Jehovah. Well, how do we know what

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:39.839
will make Jehovah happy? We identify the Bible principles that have a bearing on the situation.

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:47.359
One way we can do that is by checking the index or the research guide. What are some

00:17:47.359 --> 00:17:52.000
scriptural principles assistive who's married to an unbeliever might consider when deciding whether

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:59.440
to attend a funeral in a church? Can you think of some? What about 1 Peter 3 verse 1?

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:06.319
Lives be in subjection to your husbands. Jehovah is pleased when a Christian woman respects

00:18:06.319 --> 00:18:14.720
her husband whether he's in the truth or not. But a wife's subjection is relative. She's

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:24.720
dedicated to Jehovah, not to her husband. She's dedicated to Jehovah, not to her husband.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:30.960
So that's 1 Peter 3.1. What about Isaiah 52 and verse 11?

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:36.400
Touch nothing unclean. Keep yourselves clean.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.920
Under the mosaic law, if someone so much has touched something unclean, he became unclean.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:50.960
Many brothers and sisters would find it very hard to sit quietly while a clergyman told lies

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:55.920
about the condition of the dead. To them, it would be touching something unclean.

00:18:56.319 --> 00:19:02.880
Others might compare that to a young person in school sitting quietly while his teacher tells lies

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:11.519
about the origin of life. If someone does decide to attend a funeral in a church, he or she should

00:19:11.519 --> 00:19:18.559
be absolutely determined not to participate in any religious ritual, whether singing hymns

00:19:18.559 --> 00:19:25.440
or so much as saying amen to a prayer that a clergyman offers. Remember the goal? To please

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:34.559
Jehovah. So the first point was what makes Jehovah happy? Number two. Number two.

00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:47.410
How might my choice affect others? Have you got that? How might my choice affect others?

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:54.849
We would never want to stumble anyone. Even in a family matter, such as attending a wedding or

00:19:54.849 --> 00:20:00.930
a funeral in a church which we may consider as a personal matter, we need to weigh the effect our

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:08.769
decision could have on others. It could affect them in one of two ways. Now the first is the obvious

00:20:08.769 --> 00:20:15.569
way. In some areas of a witness even entered a church, his brothers and sisters would lose respect

00:20:15.569 --> 00:20:22.289
for him. But there's a second way the witness could stumble someone. He might be able to attend

00:20:22.369 --> 00:20:28.529
the funeral and make no compromise. But suppose a new brother decided to follow his example when a

00:20:28.529 --> 00:20:35.490
family member died. The new brother could give in to family pressure and participate in idolatry.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:43.490
How tragic is that? The Apostle Paul never worshiped idols. So when meat that had been offered to

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:48.769
an idol went up for sale at a meat market, it probably didn't bother Paul's conscience to buy it

00:20:48.849 --> 00:20:56.210
because he knew that an idol is nothing. But somehow his brothers had worshipped those very idols

00:20:56.210 --> 00:21:01.410
before coming into the truth. They could have felt guilty about eating that meat. To them,

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:10.140
it would be like having a communion meal with an idol. The feelings of his brothers were important

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:15.819
to Paul. He was willing to sacrifice his own rights for the sake of his brothers.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:22.059
We'd never want to take the unloving view that if our brother is stumbled by what we do,

00:21:22.059 --> 00:21:29.579
it's too bad for him. On the other hand, if we're the type of person who is often stumbled by

00:21:29.579 --> 00:21:38.779
what others do, we need to ask Jehovah to help us gain a more balanced viewpoint. So far,

00:21:38.779 --> 00:21:44.140
we've discussed the need to make Jehovah happy and to consider the feelings of our brothers.

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:55.740
What's next? Number three, have I asked for counsel? Have you got that? Have I asked for counsel?

00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:01.980
Now maybe the elders haven't dealt with the exact situation we're facing, but they know a lot of

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:08.140
people. They may know someone who has dealt with the situation before and seen how we handled it.

00:22:09.099 --> 00:22:13.420
Or they may know about the effect the decision had on others, for example,

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:19.339
they might know how the congregation reacted the last time someone attended a wedding

00:22:19.339 --> 00:22:27.019
or a funeral in a church. Another situation where brothers often ask for the help of the elders

00:22:27.579 --> 00:22:33.019
involves the use of blood fractions. Should we accept them or not?

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:38.380
The governing body has refused to impose its conscience on the brotherhood.

00:22:39.019 --> 00:22:43.900
And what do we know? We know that the Bible says to abstain from blood.

00:22:45.099 --> 00:22:50.619
But as you divide it into fractions, and the fractions get tinier and tinier,

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:58.539
at what point does blood stop being blood? Each one will have to decide that for himself.

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:04.700
Now some might say, well, if it's a really, really tiny fraction, it doesn't bother me to take it.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:10.140
But others will say, it doesn't matter to me. If it's from blood, I don't want it.

00:23:10.779 --> 00:23:16.059
And their conscience also has to be respected. Now let's illustrate.

00:23:17.339 --> 00:23:27.259
Air is made up of nitrogen and oxygen. And together, they make up 99% of air.

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:37.099
That leaves 1%. The 1% is made up of a variety of gases, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, neon,

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:44.619
small fractions. When it comes to small fractions, elders need to be careful, though,

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:49.900
not to insert their personal opinion into the discussion, such as by saying,

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:56.140
I wouldn't take any of it. They should simply help the publisher to reason on the basic principles

00:23:56.220 --> 00:24:02.779
and let him make up his own mind. So where are we? We make sure whole of the happy,

00:24:02.779 --> 00:24:08.859
we consider the feelings of our brothers and sisters, we ask for counsel. Number four,

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:21.180
did I take the time? Did I take the time to meditate prayerfully before making my decision?

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:26.700
Your goal is to make Jehovah happy. So you wouldn't want to make your decision hastily and

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:32.220
then ask Jehovah to bless it. We should ask Jehovah for guidance first, rather than asking him to

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:39.420
bless the decision we've already made. Have you ever heard someone say, that doesn't bother my

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:44.059
conscience? We might not be able to do it. We might not be able to do it.

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:51.660
Have you ever heard someone say, that doesn't bother my conscience? We might ask,

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:58.380
how did he come to that conclusion? Did he follow the four steps we just mentioned?

00:24:59.019 --> 00:25:04.940
Did he do research to learn what makes Jehovah happy? Did he think about how others might be

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:11.819
affected? Did he ask for counsel? And did he meditate prayerfully on his decision? Or,

00:25:12.619 --> 00:25:20.220
is he just following his feelings? Following your feelings isn't the same as following a

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:28.380
Bible-trained conscience. I'm going to repeat that. Following your feelings is not the same as

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:35.740
following a Bible-trained conscience. Our conscience needs to be trained in harmony with

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:40.859
scriptural principles. Now, Paul's counsel conscience didn't bother him a bit when he was

00:25:40.859 --> 00:25:46.460
persecuting Christians. He thought he was doing Jehovah a favor. But when he realized how

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:52.619
Jehovah felt about it, he knew he had to change. We have to be sure that we're really getting

00:25:52.619 --> 00:26:04.099
Jehovah's thinking on matters. Remember Jeremiah 17 and verse 9. Simple expression, but so true.

00:26:04.819 --> 00:26:14.430
Jeremiah chapter 17 and verse 9. It says,

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:22.430
the heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate. Who can know it?

00:26:24.509 --> 00:26:32.269
The heart is treacherous. We might allow our emotions to get the better of us. For example,

00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:37.390
when a family member is disfellowshipped. If the person is living outside the home, we know

00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:43.630
that we should limit our association to necessary family business. Now, if the family was never

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:50.829
very close, that might not be a problem. But suppose family ties are really strong. That can

00:26:50.829 --> 00:26:57.710
be a challenge. If we allow ourselves to be ruled by emotion, rather than by scriptural principles,

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:04.269
we could stretch the meaning of necessary family business to include almost any activity.

00:27:05.869 --> 00:27:08.029
The heart is treacherous.

00:27:10.029 --> 00:27:15.390
Asking ourselves the four questions we just mentioned can help us to make decisions based on

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:24.109
godly principles rather than simply relying on our feelings. Now, let's see how mature Christians

00:27:24.109 --> 00:27:32.029
can apply these principles and how the elders can help. The following video interviews are about

00:27:32.029 --> 00:27:38.269
weddings and funerals, a touchy subject in many cultures, as you will see.

00:27:44.509 --> 00:27:50.589
In Japan, religious rituals are associated with each stage of life and with each season of the

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:58.319
year. As Jehovah's Witnesses, we want to keep the cleanliness and unity of the congregation.

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:06.160
In this regard, one of the most delicate areas is the decision on whether to attend a non-witness

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:15.380
funeral or not. The first thing we must consider regarding funerals is not to be involved in religious

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:22.380
rituals, the acts of worship that are condemned by the Bible. In harmony with the principle at

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:29.099
the 2 Corinthians chapter 6 and verse 14, we need to keep completely separate from pagan acts of

00:28:29.099 --> 00:28:37.200
worship. Next, even if we don't participate in the worship of other religions, we need to

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:44.799
consider if our decisions could stumble someone in the congregation. When we consider the Bible

00:28:44.799 --> 00:28:51.279
principle in Luke chapter 17, verse 2, we do not want our decisions to hinder the faith of someone

00:28:51.279 --> 00:29:00.690
in the congregation. The third point to think about is our conscience.

00:29:02.529 --> 00:29:07.890
We need to seriously think about the Bible principle in Galatians chapter 6, verse 5,

00:29:08.529 --> 00:29:16.000
where it says that each must carry his own load. This Bible principle also applies when elders

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:23.680
want to support others. Of course, those in the congregation can ask the elders for support

00:29:23.759 --> 00:29:31.440
in issues related to funerals. However, in matters of conscience, elders cannot force decisions

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:39.099
on others. So it would be wrong to make some kind of rule regarding attending non-witness funerals.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:47.519
If each person can make decisions based on Bible principles, we can have a truly peaceful

00:29:47.519 --> 00:29:53.119
and free atmosphere, where each individual's differing situation is respected.

00:29:55.410 --> 00:30:01.170
This would really contribute to the unity of the congregation, and all can maintain a clean

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:11.740
conscience and serve happily before Jehovah. In my culture, specifically the Namibian or Shihuambo

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:18.539
culture, like in many African cultures, there are many artistic customs related to weddings

00:30:18.539 --> 00:30:24.140
that are included in wedding celebrations. Unfortunately, my family is not in the truth,

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:30.299
so obviously for Ben and I, that was one of the main concerns. They don't understand our worship

00:30:30.299 --> 00:30:35.660
of Jehovah and they understand that we apply Bible principles and not a tradition of men.

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:40.700
We got engaged before the pandemic, but obviously now that our wedding was to be over video

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:47.180
conferencing, it meant that we didn't have control over many things. We tried to imagine situations

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:55.869
that could stumble our brothers or disrupt the unity in the congregation. We had to, in advance,

00:30:55.869 --> 00:31:00.349
think of Bible principles that would apply in our case, but particularly what we also found

00:31:00.349 --> 00:31:07.069
helpful was speaking to a mature elder. He gave us a principle in Proverbs 14 verse 15.

00:31:08.829 --> 00:31:14.990
He told us to be very careful when people say, I will do this or I won't do this at your wedding.

00:31:16.109 --> 00:31:20.829
Basically, it was up to us to make sure that the proceedings or things that happened at our

00:31:20.829 --> 00:31:27.069
wedding would be in order and in harmony with Bible principles. Another principle that came to

00:31:27.069 --> 00:31:35.150
mind was 1 Corinthians 10 verse 23. So obviously we knew that we had the right to do many things,

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:41.710
but we were also very conscious of how our brothers would view our wedding. We didn't want

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:46.829
anybody to be at our wedding and feel embarrassed or even stumbled to be there.

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:52.589
Now, looking back at our wedding, we look back with fond memories.

00:31:54.109 --> 00:32:02.190
So a buying Bible principle doesn't restrict our fun. Also it contributed to the unity

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:07.150
among our brothers because all of us, those present, those who were invited, we were able to enjoy

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:12.430
the wedding. You're not worried about, oh, did that thing offend anybody? So you're able to

00:32:12.509 --> 00:32:25.089
enjoy the day without any bad memories. As you can see, our brothers in many countries are faced

00:32:25.089 --> 00:32:30.690
with very difficult decisions where weddings and funerals are concerned. The guidance the

00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:38.289
elders can provide is invaluable. Now sometimes medical doctors complain that their witness

00:32:38.289 --> 00:32:43.569
patients are inconsistent because we don't all have the same view of certain medical treatments.

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:49.650
One witness patient accepts certain fractions or therapies. So the doctor figures he knows what

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:55.569
Jehovah's Witnesses believe. But then the next patient comes along and he rejects them all.

00:32:56.609 --> 00:33:02.049
The doctor is confused. Those doctors don't understand the role of the conscience.

00:33:02.849 --> 00:33:07.410
We shouldn't worry when medical professionals don't understand our differing viewpoints because

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:13.089
we should be glad that we serve a God who dignifies us with the freedom to make many

00:33:13.089 --> 00:33:20.960
of our own decisions. Now the Apostle Paul mentioned four qualities that will help us to maintain

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:27.359
the uniting bond of peace. And we're going to find those qualities at Ephesians chapter 4 and we're

00:33:27.359 --> 00:33:36.400
going to zero in on verse 2. Let's turn to Ephesians chapter 4 and we're going to look at verse 2.

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:43.039
Now we read verses 3 to 6 earlier and you know that Paul was concerned about unity. Unity is what

00:33:43.039 --> 00:33:49.039
he had on his mind. And now he's telling us that these four qualities are going to help us to

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:56.720
maintain our unity earnestly endeavoring. Remember what he said earnestly endeavoring to maintain

00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:04.160
the oneness of the Spirit. The work that we need to put into promoting unity. Verse 2.

00:34:05.119 --> 00:34:16.960
With all humility and mildness with patience putting up with one another in love.

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:25.599
Isn't that beautiful? You notice the qualities humility, mildness, patience and love.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:31.519
When we're humble we recognize that our opinion isn't always the right one.

00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:38.000
Humility will also prevent us from trying to impose our conscience on others as if

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.440
Jehovah had appointed us to judge them. What about mildness?

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:49.280
Mildness will help us to think about the effect our words might have on our brothers and sisters.

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:56.400
We would never want to hurt them even when we strongly disagree with them. And we should give

00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:04.719
them the benefit of the doubt. If someone says something that makes you mad, pray before you speak.

00:35:06.559 --> 00:35:18.639
Pray before you speak. Love covers a multitude of sins which contributes to the peace of the congregation.

00:35:19.599 --> 00:35:25.679
And we deeply appreciate it when our brothers are patient with us. In turn we need to be patient

00:35:26.639 --> 00:35:32.639
because we're all at different stages of spiritual growth and we have to acknowledge that.

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:41.199
Well we've talked about making Jehovah happy with our decisions. We can also please Jehovah when

00:35:41.199 --> 00:35:47.199
we work hard to promote peace in the congregation. And sometimes it does take an earnest

00:35:47.199 --> 00:35:53.440
endeavor sometimes we have to work hard at ensuring that the congregation is at peace.

00:35:53.519 --> 00:35:59.039
What about the elders? The elders take the lead in working together in unity.

00:36:00.079 --> 00:36:06.320
They should always speak with the united voice. If they don't the congregation will sense that

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:12.639
they're divided and this will make the brothers and sisters uneasy. Any difference of opinion

00:36:12.639 --> 00:36:19.760
should we work down in private while showing deep respect for one another. Just because someone

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:25.840
disagrees with us doesn't make him a bad person. We have to understand that. And his

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:31.440
difference of opinion may search us through. It may be something that we need to think about and

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:38.320
consider. And we always consider that the other person may be right. What about us publishers?

00:36:39.039 --> 00:36:44.079
If we're having a hard time getting along with someone, rather than asking Jehovah to change him,

00:36:44.719 --> 00:36:51.360
we should ask Jehovah to mold us like the great potter he is. We should ask him to show us why

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:57.519
he drew that person to the congregation. Remember what Jesus said? No one comes to him unless the

00:36:57.519 --> 00:37:07.440
father draws him. What does Jehovah see in that person that we aren't seeing? We each have a

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:11.519
responsibility to contribute to the peace and unity of the congregation.

00:37:11.519 --> 00:37:19.599
May Jehovah bless us as we work toward that goal.
