00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:09.580
Do you gossip? No? Well, whenever we share any news about others, that is a form of gossip.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.259
Because we are interested in others, we might say, I'm really concerned about Brother

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:20.699
Smith's health. Or did you hear about Sister Brown's experience in the ministry? Is this

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:29.140
type of gossip harmful? Generally not. Still, we need to be careful. At 1 Timothy 513, Paul

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:36.780
spoke out against certain sisters who were gossipers and medallers in other people's affairs.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.100
We do not need to know and share everything we know about what's happening in other people's

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.619
lives. What if, for example, Brother Smith did not want others to know details about his

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:54.740
health problem? We need to respect the privacy of others. Or what if talking about Sister

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:01.140
Brown's experience turns into, oh, you know, she always brags about her success in the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:09.140
ministry. When I talk about others, turns negative. It can develop into slander. Slander

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:16.180
is making deliberate fault statements that damage another's reputation. Let's now consider

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:25.379
how harmful gossip wrecks peace. If you have spread harmful gossip about someone and he hears

00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:32.579
about it, when you see him the next time, what will be the look on his face? Please read

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:44.980
with me Proverbs 25-23. The North Wind brings a downpour and a gossiping tongue brings an angry

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:54.819
face. The North Wind in Palestine brought dark clouds and rain. Likewise, when the one you gossiped

00:01:54.819 --> 00:02:03.140
about catches wind of this and he sees you, he will have a gloomy, angry face. There will be

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:12.419
a storm and a chilled relationship. Now, when that happens, he may feel very badly and apologize,

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:20.819
but you may have damaged his reputation in a way that may be difficult to undo. Listen to this

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:30.740
old Jewish story. A man went about town slandering the town's wise man. Later, the malicious

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.500
gossiper realized his wrong and went to the wise man and asked for his forgiveness. He offered

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:44.740
whatever was needed to make a man's. The wise man made one request. He told the gossiper to take

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:52.580
a feather pillow, cut it open, and scatter the feathers to the wind. The gossiper was

00:02:52.580 --> 00:03:00.099
puzzled by this request, but he did as instructed. Then he returned to the wise man. Am I now forgiven

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:08.900
yes? First, go and gather all the feathers. The wise man responded. But how can I? The wind has

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:16.819
already scattered them. The wise man replied, it is as difficult to repair the damage done by your

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:26.259
words as it is to recover the feathers. Yes, once spoken, hurtful words cannot be retrieved.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:34.900
Let's not scatter feathers in the wind. If we spread rumors, it can seriously disturb the

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:42.900
piece of many in the congregation. We find an example of this at Acts 21, verses 20 and 21.

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:51.219
The older men of the Jerusalem congregation explained to Paul that some Jews had spread a rumor

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:58.419
among Jewish Christians that he had been teaching an apostasy, speaking against the law of Moses.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:05.780
Of course, this was a twisting of the facts. Paul never spoke disrespectfully of the law.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.819
He even went to synagogues where he reasoned on the basis of the Hebrew scriptures.

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:18.259
Such stories could have led some newly converted Jewish Christians to think that Paul did not

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:24.259
respect God's arrangements, and this could have seriously disrupted the piece of the congregation.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:33.060
In the following dramatization, notice the effect that harmful gossip can have on the piece

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:42.060
in a congregation. Especially as a pioneer. What kind of example is she setting?

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.980
Has Emily stopped following her? No, not yet, but she probably will. Alistair, what do you think?

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:57.339
About what? Haley's posts on a quick post. Is there a problem? Emily's told me,

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:05.420
they're all just look at me, my clothes, my hair, my makeup, and even senior agrees with her.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:15.819
Well, it's very easy to take things out of context on social media. I know that I've done that

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:22.300
and realized later that I was wrong. Yeah, that's a good point.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.660
Listen, I don't want to pull you away, but if you have a minute, would you mind giving me a hand

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:43.860
with these boxes? Sure. Thanks for your help. No problem.

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:51.379
Jake, back in the hall, I know you were just expressing concern, but here's something to consider.

00:05:52.339 --> 00:06:01.779
This principle is one of my favourites. It's found in Proverbs chapter 18 and verse 17.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:10.550
The first to state his case seems right until the other party comes and cross-examines it,

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:23.300
and he's trying to understand. It just means that sometimes we only hear one side of a story,

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.620
and until we personally hear both, it's best not to draw any conclusions.

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:36.740
And even then, if it's something negative, we wouldn't want to spread it.

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:51.500
Any more than we want something spread about ourselves. I'm going to apologise to Harry and Marie

00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:08.699
and have Emily talk directly to Haley. Good idea. Did you notice what Jake said

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:17.579
after the elder graciously helped him reason on Proverbs 18, 17? He said, I had not considered that.

00:07:18.779 --> 00:07:25.819
Yes. Jake just did not stop and think before he said those negative things about Haley.

00:07:26.939 --> 00:07:35.899
So how can we put away harmful gossip before it begins? Let's read Proverbs 15, 28.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.740
The heart of the righteous one meditates before answering,

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:53.060
but the mouth of the wicked blurs out bad things. So before we say bad things about others,

00:07:53.060 --> 00:08:00.819
we need to meditate. Though this does not mean a long drawn out process, it just requires a little thought.

00:08:01.779 --> 00:08:09.379
What thoughts could have stopped Jake from repeating his wife's negative view of Haley's post?

00:08:10.339 --> 00:08:20.740
He could have asked himself, is what I am about to say true? Is it kind, loving? How will Harry and Marie

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:28.500
view Haley if they hear those negative things about her? Another principle that will help us to

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:37.059
put away harmful gossip is the so-called golden rule as recorded at Luke 631. Jesus said,

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:45.299
just as you want men to do to you, do the same to them. This means showing empathy,

00:08:46.179 --> 00:08:53.059
putting ourselves in the place of the other person, asking ourselves, how would I feel if someone

00:08:53.059 --> 00:09:02.379
said this about me? One situation that may tempt us to engage in harmful gossip is when we believe

00:09:02.379 --> 00:09:09.580
we have been wronged by someone. Instead of applying the counsel at Matthew 5, 23, and 24,

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:17.820
and chapter 18, verse 15, to talk to the person privately, we could start talking about it to others

00:09:17.899 --> 00:09:25.419
who are not involved. Imagine if after finally talking with the person you find out he actually

00:09:25.419 --> 00:09:33.259
did not wrong you at all. You have made the situation much worse. But whether we are right or wrong,

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:39.019
engaging in hurtful speech will never improve a situation.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:49.460
Gossip requires a speaker and a listener. Is it wrong to listen to harmful gossip?

00:09:50.179 --> 00:09:59.539
Yes, know what Proverbs 174 says. A wicked man pays attention to hurtful speech,

00:10:00.419 --> 00:10:06.259
and a deceptive man listens to a malicious tongue. Think about that.

00:10:07.139 --> 00:10:15.139
In God's eyes, if we listen to hurtful and malicious speech, we too bear a heavy responsibility.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:19.940
By listening to the Gossiper, we are encouraging him to go on.

00:10:21.299 --> 00:10:27.620
So what should you do? Without taking on an air of self-righteousness, you could simply say,

00:10:28.179 --> 00:10:35.379
let's change the subject. Or I don't really feel comfortable talking about this.

00:10:36.179 --> 00:10:44.179
After all, she is not here to defend herself. And if we find that her brother or sister

00:10:44.179 --> 00:10:52.419
likes to gossip, we may find it easier to avoid harmful gossip by stopping close association

00:10:52.500 --> 00:11:02.820
with that person. Proverbs 20 verse 19, frankly, councils do not associate with one who loves to gossip.

00:11:04.179 --> 00:11:13.220
So dear friends, let's put away harmful gossip, doing so we will maintain our precious peace and

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:20.580
unity. Brother Kenneth Cook, a member of the governing body, will now present the final talk of

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:29.139
this symposium, put away peace records, uncontrolled anger.
