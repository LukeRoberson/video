00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:11.550
We warmly welcome you to another edition of J. W. Broadcasting.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.190
And this broadcast is historic, in what ways?

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.309
Well, think about this.

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:25.550
The first broadcast on this station was in October of 2014.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.550
It is hard to believe, but seven months have already flown by.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:38.950
That means that each member of the governing body has had the opportunity to host one of

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:45.149
our monthly programs, and we are now starting over again.

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:52.030
But what is truly historic about this month's program is that the governing body has approved

00:00:52.030 --> 00:01:02.789
the J. W. Broadcasting to be broadcast, now listen to this, in over 40 different languages.

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.069
While these are not all available at this time, many additional languages are ready for

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:12.430
viewing this month.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:21.989
The list of languages can be found on the tv.jw.org homepage by clicking on the language

00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:27.510
symbol at the top right hand corner of the screen.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:35.420
That takes you to the page with the various languages that can be selected.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:45.540
This month, we will find out what Bible principle can help us make a sound decision when forced

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.980
to choose between our seconder job and theocratic activities.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:02:02.379
So to what links does Jehovah's organization go to reach the blind with a good news?

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:10.659
This documentary will assure us of Jehovah's love for everyone, no matter what our circumstances

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:13.300
in life might be.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:22.930
And we have a music video about giving our time and resources to Jehovah.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:52.569
Yes, this is the May program of J. W. Broadcasting.

00:02:52.569 --> 00:03:01.969
The governing body has asked me to use Proverbs 39 as the theme for the message they would

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:08.210
like to be shared with the entire household of faith this month.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.849
Let's read that text together.

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.569
Proverbs chapter 3, verse 9.

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:21.449
And after we read it, we want to consider what are your valuable things.

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:25.770
And what does the verse mean by giving the first fruits?

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:38.039
Let's read Proverbs chapter 3, verse 9, honor Jehovah with your valuable things, with

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:43.319
the first fruits of all your produce.

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:50.750
Let's first talk a little bit about what it means to offer our first fruits.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.789
In Bible times, it meant the earliest fruits of a season.

00:03:56.789 --> 00:04:02.389
So way before an Israelite knew what kind of a harvest he would have, whether it would

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:10.750
be a bumper crop or very meager returns with full faith and confidence he was to give

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:17.629
the first fruits to Jehovah, not just leftovers at the end of the harvest season.

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:26.069
Furthermore, the Hebrew word for first fruit is in the sense of being the best of that

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:28.149
early season.

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:35.790
So the idea conveyed is not only first chronologically, but also first in quality.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:48.990
In fact, Exodus 23, 19 says this, it says, you are to bring the best of the first ripe fruits

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.750
of your ground to the house of Jehovah, your God.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.509
The best of the first fruits would truly honor Jehovah.

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:08.310
And the Greek term for first fruits comes from a root word, having the basic meaning

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.589
of primacy or pre-eminence.

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:18.990
Again, the idea, the best we have.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:25.990
Jehovah's 3.9 also indicated that we can honor our show respect and appreciation for

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.589
Jehovah with our valuable things.

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:38.949
And as stated at Revelation 4.11, Jehovah is truly worthy of all the honor we can give

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:40.269
him.

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:47.029
Not only do we owe it to him, because he is our creator, he is worthy of it because of

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:49.949
the kind of God he is.

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:56.790
But what are the valuable things with which we can honor Jehovah?

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:04.430
What first might come to mind are our material possessions, our finances.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.110
Well that is true.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.389
And we want to talk about this a little bit later.

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:15.870
But there are many other valuables that a Christian can offer to Jehovah to give him

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.509
the honor that he is worthy of.

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:27.629
For example, our time, Mr. Benjamin Franklin, a scientist and statesman once said,

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:34.670
do not squander time for that as the stuff life is made of.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:40.110
Yes, time is a valuable resource.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:46.629
And many of you dear ones are offering your valuable time in the ministry each month.

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:54.829
Some of you are able to give to Jehovah 70 or more hours a month in the ministry as

00:06:54.829 --> 00:06:57.470
regular pioneers.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:03.310
While others of us are not in a position to spend that amount of time in the field ministry,

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.389
we rejoice with those who can.

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:14.790
And interestingly, under the law given to Moses, the quantity of first fruits to be offered

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:17.069
was not fixed.

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:23.029
It was left to the generosity and circumstances of the giver.

00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:31.430
He was to give his best though, no matter how much or how little that proved to be.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:39.670
No matter what the amount then, can we give the first fruits of our time in the ministry?

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:47.029
We do this by scheduling some time early in the month, not just leftovers the last few

00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:49.430
days of the month.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:55.829
Remember, we give Jehovah our first fruits.

00:07:55.829 --> 00:08:04.550
And other valuable things do we possess that we can give to Jehovah thus honoring him.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:10.310
Well many have construction skills and other talents that they are willing to offer for

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:18.750
the building of kingdom halls, assembly halls, remote translation offices, and branch facilities,

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:26.350
including the large world headquarters complex in Warwick, New York.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:35.549
Jehovah is magnified by such voluntary contributions of energy and skills.

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:42.220
These are truly valuable things.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:49.460
But now, I would like to address the valuable things that may have first come to mind.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.620
Or financial giving and support.

00:08:53.620 --> 00:09:02.419
As you know, for over 130 years, this organization has never solicited for funds.

00:09:02.419 --> 00:09:05.620
And it is certainly not going to start now.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:13.059
We don't send out monthly statements to each of Jehovah's Witnesses specifying a dollar amount

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:18.259
that should be submitted to finance the work worldwide.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:24.179
Most donations, in fact, are contributed anonymously.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:31.220
Over the years, I have told various Bible students that a person could attend our meetings

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:35.620
for 20 years and never put a penny in the contribution box.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.100
And we would not know it.

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:45.460
Jehovah, of course, would know it, but we would not, because the donations are anonymous,

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:54.580
but from the heart. We don't know who gives what, but for a certainty.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:03.379
Any donations received do not line anyone's pockets and are not misappropriated.

00:10:03.779 --> 00:10:09.620
They are all used in supporting theocratic endeavors worldwide.

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:17.779
As described in Matthew 24, 45 through 47, the governing body prayerfully and sincerely

00:10:17.779 --> 00:10:28.659
endeavors to be not only the faithful slave, but also the discrete slave in wisely managing

00:10:28.659 --> 00:10:36.100
the master's resources. And please, dear brothers and sisters, pray for Jehovah to help us

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:42.100
to be successful in being not only faithful, but also discrete.

00:10:43.379 --> 00:10:46.580
But often a member of the governing body will be heard to say,

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:56.259
in spending Jehovah's money, we have to be more careful than we are in spending our own money.

00:10:56.899 --> 00:11:03.860
And that is truly how we feel about the matter. Yet, as you can well imagine,

00:11:04.659 --> 00:11:11.779
millions of dollars are required each month to finance the colossal kingdom work

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:19.299
that is being supported by this organization in some 239 lands.

00:11:20.259 --> 00:11:29.220
What is all of the financial support come from? Largely from you, dear brothers and sisters.

00:11:30.659 --> 00:11:38.419
Most funds come from what you voluntarily put in the contribution box in your kingdom hall.

00:11:39.299 --> 00:11:48.340
Yes, that little box with a slot that is labeled worldwide work is primarily what

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:54.259
finances all of the theocratic initiatives that have been implemented.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:01.220
Of course, there are many other ways to contribute, as explained usually,

00:12:02.019 --> 00:12:05.860
in the November issue of the watch tower each year.

00:12:07.779 --> 00:12:14.179
Sometimes we may feel a little shy to talk about the financial needs of the organization.

00:12:15.139 --> 00:12:22.100
That is understandable, because we in no way want to be categorized with other organizations,

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:30.259
religious and otherwise, that coerce their supporters to donate.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:36.259
However, because all of us have the privilege to donate funds,

00:12:37.379 --> 00:12:41.779
we would like to let you know something about our current situation.

00:12:42.659 --> 00:12:46.340
Then you can respond as your heart impels you.

00:12:49.669 --> 00:12:54.309
As you might have sensed, I am not shy about this subject.

00:12:55.429 --> 00:12:56.230
And why not?

00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:02.629
It is because we have many scriptural examples of Jehovah's faithful servants

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:07.830
making known the financial needs of the congregation.

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:14.789
Only when supporters of the kingdom know the needs, can they respond accordingly.

00:13:15.909 --> 00:13:21.350
For example, turn with me, please, to Exodus chapter 35.

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:25.190
Now, think about this as you're turning there.

00:13:26.149 --> 00:13:28.870
The Israelites were in Sinai.

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:33.909
They were marching through a wilderness.

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:38.470
They did not have fields or businesses with money flowing in.

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:43.110
They just had what they had brought with them when leaving Egypt.

00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:50.149
Nevertheless, Jehovah instructed them to build a place of worship.

00:13:51.429 --> 00:13:56.149
Was Jehovah shy about letting the people know about the material needs?

00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:02.629
Well, read with me, Exodus 35 verses 4 and 5.

00:14:05.159 --> 00:14:09.399
Moses then said to the entire assembly of the Israelites,

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:14.679
this is what Jehovah has commanded.

00:14:14.679 --> 00:14:16.279
Now, what Moses commanded?

00:14:16.919 --> 00:14:20.039
This is what Jehovah has commanded.

00:14:20.679 --> 00:14:27.960
Take up a contribution for Jehovah from among yourselves.

00:14:28.919 --> 00:14:35.639
Let everyone with a willing heart bring a contribution for Jehovah.

00:14:36.679 --> 00:14:39.639
Gold, silver, copper.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:47.929
You see, the people would not have known this need if Jehovah had not informed them.

00:14:48.889 --> 00:14:51.049
Very interesting, is it not?

00:14:52.889 --> 00:15:00.570
The governing body very much feels the urgency of accomplishing as much as we possibly can

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:06.009
in behalf of Kingdom interest knowing that the great day of Jehovah is dear.

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:13.289
So, in an effort to keep you informed of the support that is needed for this great work,

00:15:14.409 --> 00:15:17.210
I have the following information to share.

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:27.850
We have looked forward to this next fiscal year and projected the expenditures

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:31.450
for all of the theocratic initiatives we are scheduling.

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:40.250
In doing the math, we found that the amount of money flowing out will be much greater

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:44.250
than the amount of money that we have coming in at this time.

00:15:45.529 --> 00:15:46.490
Well, why is that?

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:51.049
Does this represent a lack of appreciation for spiritual things?

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.889
No, absolutely not.

00:15:56.169 --> 00:16:03.450
To the contrary, we are witnessing unprecedented enthusiasm among the brotherhood

00:16:04.169 --> 00:16:07.850
for all the spiritual bounty that is coming our way.

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:14.809
We have up-to-date Bibles and an abundance of printed literature.

00:16:15.769 --> 00:16:23.610
And there's so much appreciation for the new and continually improving JW.org website.

00:16:25.289 --> 00:16:32.409
From around the world, we receive letters thanking the governing body for JW Broadcasting.

00:16:33.529 --> 00:16:37.929
Many comment that it has brought us closer together as a people.

00:16:38.809 --> 00:16:43.929
And as mentioned, starting this month, JW Broadcasting is available

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:50.250
in multiple languages. We are thrilled about this development.

00:16:51.289 --> 00:16:56.250
There is also excitement about public witnessing using literature cards

00:16:57.129 --> 00:16:59.129
and with such great success.

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:08.410
No, the financial circumstance has nothing to do with a lack of spirituality or appreciation.

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:15.609
However, there are some facts that we want to make you aware of.

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:28.980
For one thing, the financial needs in the field have accelerated at a pace unlike any time in the

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:36.259
recent past. A recent analysis of the need for Kingdom Halls here in the United States showed

00:17:36.339 --> 00:17:46.980
that some 1,600 new Kingdom Halls or major renovations are needed, not some time in the future,

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:57.059
but right now. And worldwide, we are in need of more than 14,000 places of worship,

00:17:57.539 --> 00:18:09.460
not including ongoing future growth. In the past 15 years, 30,000 Kingdom Halls have been built.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:14.740
Now, if you figure that out, that average is about 2,000 Kingdom Halls every year.

00:18:15.859 --> 00:18:19.779
But in an effort to relieve the serious backlog more quickly,

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:29.619
we intend to overwilling to complete 3,000 Kingdom Hall projects every year going forward.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:38.180
Now, that's a 50% increase. Additionally, adjustments are being made to simplify the Kingdom Hall

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:47.059
design in order to accelerate the construction schedule and to save funds. Though the design will

00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:55.140
be simplified, the sheer number of Kingdom Halls requires considerably more funds in the budget

00:18:55.859 --> 00:19:05.940
than in times past. Additionally, please think about this. Today, how many publishing companies print

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:16.339
publications in the many languages that Jehovah's Organization does? The answer? None. And why is that?

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:26.420
Is because they cannot make a financial profit? We, however, are accelerating our method

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:36.019
of translating publications into indigenous languages. This involves building or purchasing

00:19:36.019 --> 00:19:45.140
regional translation offices or RTOs. These will be strategically located in the part of a country

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:50.019
with the highest concentration of native speakers of the language.

00:19:51.539 --> 00:19:57.700
Providing these structures in various regions of a country reduces the need for costly

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:04.740
construction expansion at the local branch office. But in the next two years, however,

00:20:05.539 --> 00:20:15.940
upwards, now think about this, 170 of such facilities. RTOs are needed.

00:20:17.619 --> 00:20:25.859
Depending on the country and the cost of materials, an RTO can cost for about $1 million

00:20:26.019 --> 00:20:35.380
to several million dollars each. Hence, we have another reason we need to increase our finances.

00:20:36.819 --> 00:20:44.579
We just felt that you, dear brothers and sisters, needed to be made aware of these expenditures

00:20:45.539 --> 00:20:55.539
that we're facing in the coming months and years. We also have heard from Circuit Overseers

00:20:55.539 --> 00:21:02.740
and others that some of the brothers and sisters may have a misconception about some of the

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:12.180
recent policy changes that have been instituted. For example, all congregations that had a kingdom

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:20.420
hall or assembly hall loan to pay off were informed that their mortgages were canceled.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:25.299
Now, if you think about that, it's amazing, isn't? All their loans were canceled.

00:21:26.579 --> 00:21:32.019
Can you imagine a bank telling homeowners that all their loans were canceled

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:37.059
and that they should merely send in to the bank each month whatever they can afford?

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:43.539
Only in Jehovah's organization could such a thing happen.

00:21:44.099 --> 00:21:53.220
However, according to some of our Circuit Overseers, some of us took this to mean that the organization

00:21:53.220 --> 00:22:01.299
had a surplus of funds and thus took this action as if the loans did not need to be reimbursed.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:09.140
Could this misconception have affected the amount that some have chosen to donate each month?

00:22:10.099 --> 00:22:18.339
In actuality, the mortgages were canceled so as not to be a hardship on some congregations and

00:22:18.339 --> 00:22:28.180
circuits. The policy was founded on the scriptural principle stated in 2 Corinthians 8. Please turn

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:36.660
there with me. In an effort to help fellow Christians who were facing financial hardship in the

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:45.460
first century, an arrangement had been put in place to accept contributions from others to help

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:53.859
offset the deficiency. About a year later, Paul is again writing to the Corinthians about this

00:22:53.859 --> 00:23:03.700
policy of contributing to offset the financial needs of others. Now, please read with me 2 Corinthians

00:23:03.779 --> 00:23:10.500
chapter 8, and we're going to read verses 10 through 15. Here, the Apostle Paul,

00:23:11.539 --> 00:23:23.460
under inspiration, said this, verse 10, and in this, I give my opinion, this is for your benefit

00:23:24.339 --> 00:23:30.900
seeing that already a year ago, you're not only initiated the action that is of contributing,

00:23:31.859 --> 00:23:38.900
but also showed your desire to do it. So now, also complete what you started to do,

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:47.859
so that your readiness to act or contribute may be completed according to, now notice,

00:23:48.819 --> 00:23:57.220
the means you have available. For if the readiness is there first, it is especially acceptable

00:23:58.019 --> 00:24:03.299
according to what a person has, not according to what a person does not have.

00:24:04.259 --> 00:24:11.220
For I do not want to make it easy for others, but difficult for you, but that by means of

00:24:12.259 --> 00:24:22.740
and equalizing, your surplus at the present time might offset their need, so that their surplus

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:32.980
might also offset your deficiency, that there may be an equalizing. Just as it is written,

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:41.539
the person with much did not have too much, and the person with little did not have too little.

00:24:43.299 --> 00:24:52.339
So that was the scriptural basis for canceling all loan repayments. It was not because the organization

00:24:52.339 --> 00:24:59.059
had a large surplus of funds and thus could, quote, afford to cancel these mortgages.

00:25:00.099 --> 00:25:07.059
As explained at the time, it was to equalize the reimbursement of such expenditures over the

00:25:07.059 --> 00:25:16.740
entire brotherhood. Some businessmen in the secular world might think this was a disastrous policy

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:25.859
change. However, we know the spirit of Jehovah's fateful servants. We all feel privileged to be able

00:25:25.859 --> 00:25:33.140
to help the growing brotherhood to have comfortable places to meet and praise Jehovah.

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:42.579
Think about this comparison. Back in 1990, when the decision was made to distribute our literature

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:51.299
free of charge, some within the organization and many outside the organization thought this

00:25:51.299 --> 00:26:01.140
would be financial suicide. However, you dear brothers and sisters have proved those predictions

00:26:01.619 --> 00:26:11.700
completely wrong. Jesus said, at Matthew 1119, all the same. Wisdom is proved righteous by its works.

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:18.740
Our individual voluntary donations have combined to take care of the costs associated with

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:26.900
producing our literature. And we are confident that the same will prove true regarding the decision

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:35.700
to cancel all kingdom hall and assembly hall loans. So instead of conveying the message that the

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:42.900
organization needed less in the way of donations, the intent was really just the opposite.

00:26:44.099 --> 00:26:50.980
But we have confidence that our hearts will be moved to contribute what we can each month

00:26:51.779 --> 00:26:59.940
to offset the necessary expense of building new meeting places for our brothers worldwide.

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:08.140
Another misimpression that has been brought to our attention is that the sale of property in

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:16.299
New York City means that fewer donations are needed. To help put things in proper perspective,

00:27:16.299 --> 00:27:24.619
however, selling one of the significant properties in New York really only covered the operating

00:27:24.619 --> 00:27:31.900
expenses for the worldwide work for a few weeks. Now that's one significant property.

00:27:33.339 --> 00:27:41.019
And in actuality, the sale of property in New York City is basically only financing the

00:27:41.019 --> 00:27:47.900
construction of world headquarters in Warwick and the purchase of other properties that are

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:55.500
needed to facilitate the move from Brooklyn in the future. But on top of that, as mentioned,

00:27:56.299 --> 00:28:02.700
we are planning on accelerating the building of kingdom halls and remote translation offices

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:13.579
in coming years. It is our desire, Jehovah willing, to hold to the accelerated schedule for these

00:28:13.579 --> 00:28:22.859
projects, if at all possible, rather than having to scale back such progress because of a lack of

00:28:22.859 --> 00:28:33.299
available funds. Again, we are not in any way desirous of creating a hardship on anyone.

00:28:34.259 --> 00:28:41.059
However, we felt that if you knew the circumstances accurately, you would apply

00:28:41.059 --> 00:28:50.500
Proverbs 327 to the situation. There, we are encouraged not to withhold what is good,

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:58.019
but then the scripture adds, if it is within our power to help.

00:28:58.579 --> 00:29:06.420
And I might mention that this is true even of publishers in less affluent countries.

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:15.700
It is encouraging to note that even in lands with limited resources, the very poor contribute

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:21.779
to the cost of their kingdom hall and its maintenance. We're all Jehovah's United people.

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:30.500
Even if we do not have much materially, if our heart is willing, there is usually something

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:40.980
we can do. Even if it is merely offering two small coins of very little value as the poor widow

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:51.299
did. And how did Jesus feel about her for doing this? He highly praised her in Mark 1242,

00:29:51.779 --> 00:30:01.220
through 44. And if we think about it, a small donation from each of many of Jehovah's people

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:09.619
adds up to a large amount of dedicated funds that can be used powerfully by Jehovah's organization.

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:21.220
Please turn back to Exodus chapter 35. As mentioned, Jehovah was not shy about informing his people

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:30.500
of the financial needs for true worship. But once the need was known, what was the initial result?

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:38.019
Exodus 35, and let's read verse 21 and the first part of verse 22.

00:30:40.019 --> 00:30:50.579
Then everyone whose heart impaled him and everyone whose spirit incited him came and brought

00:30:50.579 --> 00:30:58.339
their contribution for Jehovah to be used for the tent of meeting, for all his service,

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:08.500
and for the holy garments. They kept coming, the men, along with the women, each with a willing heart.

00:31:10.099 --> 00:31:16.339
And what were the final results? Well, look at Exodus chapter 36. And we're going to read

00:31:16.339 --> 00:31:23.380
verse 7. Let's see, did Jehovah have to scale back on the amount of work because of the lack of

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:35.299
material support? Verse 7, the goods were enough for all the work to be done. And more than enough.

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:45.500
Yes, when the hearts of Jehovah's people are motivated, wonderful things happen. The governing

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:53.579
body wanted to make you aware of the financial needs in the world field. And we're confident

00:31:54.220 --> 00:32:02.460
that with this knowledge, your appreciative hearts will move you to do what you can to support

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:13.019
the work at hand. Yes, we can honor Jehovah with our valuable things, including the financial

00:32:13.019 --> 00:32:23.319
support of true worship. But as we mentioned at the outset, our valuable things include much more.

00:32:24.119 --> 00:32:28.279
For example, our time as we talked about spending the ministry.

00:32:29.559 --> 00:32:38.359
May we all give our individual first fruits the best we can do with our present circumstances.

00:32:39.319 --> 00:32:45.720
Some are honoring Jehovah by moving to places where the need for kingdom preachers is greater.

00:32:46.599 --> 00:32:54.279
That's commendable. We spoke of giving our skills and energy to theocratic construction projects.

00:32:55.559 --> 00:33:03.079
We appreciate all of you who have honored Jehovah in this way in the past tirelessly working with

00:33:03.079 --> 00:33:07.400
regional building committees and in the lands with limited resources program.

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:16.759
And we thank all of you who will continue to support the construction of buildings that will bring

00:33:16.759 --> 00:33:26.200
praise to Jehovah. What other valuable things bring honor to Jehovah? Many thousands are learning new

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:35.480
languages to be able to help spread the good news to yet more deserving ones. It may well be,

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:44.200
now think about this, that this organization has the most multilingual speakers of any organization

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:53.000
on earth. That's amazing, isn't it? Still others honor Jehovah by expanding themselves on hospital

00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:02.200
liaison committees and patient visitation groups. Though you do so, often behind the scenes with no

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:11.880
limelight, be assured that those you help know what you do. And the sovereign of the universe

00:34:12.519 --> 00:34:20.599
sees you and receives your gift honorably. It is just as stated at Hebrew 610,

00:34:21.559 --> 00:34:31.639
Jehovah does not forget your work and the love you showed for his name by ministering and continuing

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:39.320
to minister to the holy ones. There are also circuit overseers and Bethel family members around the

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:49.159
earth who give their best to Jehovah daily. Some of you are faithful caregivers of sick or elderly

00:34:49.239 --> 00:35:00.039
servants of Jehovah. There is a wear factor that is hard to quantify, but know that your God accepts

00:35:00.039 --> 00:35:09.880
such a gift of love with full knowledge of what you have done. Well, at this point, I will borrow

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:17.159
the words of Paul, as he enumerated in Hebrews chapter 11, many, many women of faith.

00:35:18.119 --> 00:35:24.119
But then said, as recorded in verse 32, and what more will I say?

00:35:25.239 --> 00:35:32.280
For time will fail me if I go on to relate about, and then he listed others who had

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:41.000
honored Jehovah with their valuable things. Similarly, time would fail us if we tried to enumerate

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:49.000
all of you dear ones and all of them many ways that you are honoring Jehovah with your valuable

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:58.360
things. But may Jehovah continue to bless each and every one of you who are doing so.

00:36:01.159 --> 00:36:08.519
We have now touched on some of the ways that we can bring praise to Jehovah and support our

00:36:08.519 --> 00:36:16.920
dear brothers and sisters worldwide. In a few minutes, we will see some real life examples

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:23.880
that highlight the results of our giving spirit. But first, we would like to share with you

00:36:24.679 --> 00:36:39.980
a summary of how the organization uses our donations. In ancient times, when an Israelite made a

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:47.820
heartfelt offering to support the temple, that offering was referred to as a gift in hand to Jehovah.

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:58.420
Today, in Kingdom Halls of Jehovah's Witnesses around the world, there are small boxes marked

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:04.739
for voluntary contributions. When we give our valuable things, where does it actually go?

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:10.500
Each year, hundreds of thousands become our new brothers and sisters.

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:16.579
To accommodate our growing numbers, funds are provided to help construct new places of

00:37:16.579 --> 00:37:23.699
worship, as well as branch facilities all over the world. One thing that I really appreciate

00:37:23.699 --> 00:37:31.219
about being here is to see family heads, fathers and husbands choose to use their vacation time,

00:37:31.219 --> 00:37:38.659
so thank you to the families and the congregations that support all of this and us to be here.

00:37:38.659 --> 00:37:43.699
But what's just as impressive is seeing millions of brothers and sisters voluntarily give

00:37:43.699 --> 00:37:48.420
them their funds so that we can keep building. Just that in itself is an amazing act of

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:57.239
Job's Holy Spirit. Large doors leading to greater activity are being opened by means of

00:37:57.239 --> 00:38:03.880
theocratic schools. Training is provided to help those enrolled to develop spiritually and take

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:10.519
a zealous lead in the evangelizing work. When you think of the organization and the education

00:38:10.519 --> 00:38:17.960
the divine education that it provides, there is no government on earth today that educates

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:25.159
citizens like the kingdom. It has strengthened into my relationship with Jehovah in ways I never

00:38:25.159 --> 00:38:30.679
considered before. The training is wonderful and motivates spiritual growth.

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:38.039
Voluntary contributions help support the thousands of special full-time servants worldwide.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.440
These include Bethelites. While working in the printer it's abundantly clear that none of

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:51.639
this would happen without Jehovah's support shown by what the friends can give. I love my assignment

00:38:51.639 --> 00:38:56.760
and serve with the knowledge that my sacrifice wouldn't be possible without the sacrifice of

00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:03.480
brothers and sisters in the field. Also included are missionaries traveling overseas,

00:39:04.199 --> 00:39:12.869
international servants and special pioneers. All that support makes it possible and makes

00:39:12.869 --> 00:39:17.750
our assignment a great joy and a privilege something that we look forward to. Each and every

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:22.949
week, each and every month, each and every year that we're able to devote our full-time efforts

00:39:22.949 --> 00:39:27.590
in preaching the good news of the kingdom. It allows us to be here so that we can help as many

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:35.349
people as possible who do want to learn about Jehovah. Every year we look forward to receiving

00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:41.989
rich spiritual gems at our conventions. Funds are provided for equipment and other needs to help

00:39:41.989 --> 00:39:49.429
everything run as smoothly as possible. It was a delight this year to see how technology was used to

00:39:49.429 --> 00:39:55.190
promote the unity. Having the different cities involved were video streaming to them for the key

00:39:55.190 --> 00:40:01.030
talks by governing body members and their helpers, received tremendous response from those cities.

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:06.070
We seen more people in their seats during the program because they were afraid to get up even

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:13.670
for a moment because they might miss something that was special. When disaster strikes, your donations

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:20.710
help give immediate relief for our brothers and sisters in need, food, clothing, building materials

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:27.829
and much more are shipped over as quickly as possible. I have come to really appreciate Jehovah's

00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:34.710
organization. No other organization can compare in how it provides support in such a loving way.

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:42.070
I know now, you know, like Jehovah, this look after his people, so I'm really grateful for that

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:49.030
and I've been praying and giving thanks. Yes, all our contributions have a meaningful share

00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:56.469
in supporting King Dementra's worldwide. Each donation is like a gift in hand to our heavenly

00:40:56.469 --> 00:41:04.389
father, Jehovah. When we give from our heart, we are expressing our love for him and that is the

00:41:04.389 --> 00:41:18.940
best gift we can give him. Our organization is truly multifaceted. The brotherhood is constantly

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:27.579
giving of themselves literally day and night when we consider the global effort that is involved.

00:41:28.539 --> 00:41:37.500
At times though, some family heads face a dilemma that involves making a decision about how they

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:45.900
will support their family without putting themselves in spiritual jeopardy. You're about to meet a brother

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:55.980
who was in a quandary as to what to do. What Bible principle helped him to continue to put Kingdom

00:41:55.980 --> 00:42:10.980
Dementra's first? Let's find out. I've always enjoyed my work and even the people I worked with.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:36.679
It's hard to balance work and meetings, but since I was baptized, I've always done my best

00:42:36.679 --> 00:42:51.050
to be there. My wife is a great support and we work hard to teach our children. They've been my

00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:59.880
greatest joy. I want to make sure that they're cared for. I believed that if I worked hard enough,

00:43:01.239 --> 00:43:10.329
I'd always be able to provide for my family, but my boss wanted more than I was willing to give.

00:43:12.659 --> 00:43:24.230
He insisted that I work Sundays during my meeting. I needed this job. My wife and I were worried,

00:43:26.309 --> 00:43:34.090
what would happen if I lost it? I was determined to take a stand for my meetings.

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:48.889
I spoke to my boss and explained my decision, but he refused to compromise. I was shocked.

00:43:52.760 --> 00:44:04.809
I didn't think this was how it was supposed to go. How would I support my family? Paul studied the

00:44:04.809 --> 00:44:13.690
Bible with me. We've been close ever since. He invited me out, and I guess he'd heard about what

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:26.199
happened. He really listened as I poured out my concerns. I wondered if I should have just done

00:44:26.199 --> 00:44:33.239
what my boss insisted. I would have missed my meeting, but I still could have attended an evening

00:44:33.239 --> 00:44:42.409
meeting and a different congregation. My skills were limited, and there just weren't that many

00:44:42.409 --> 00:44:49.769
jobs out there for me. I told him I was seriously considering a job that would involve a lot of

00:44:49.769 --> 00:45:03.420
travel. Paul read to me from Matthew chapter 6 verses 25 to 33. Stop being anxious about your

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:09.260
lives as to what you will eat or what you will drink or about your bodies as to what you will wear.

00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:19.019
Keep on then seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added

00:45:19.019 --> 00:45:27.739
to you. He reminded me that as a newly baptized witness, my prayers are much more readily received,

00:45:27.739 --> 00:45:38.679
and Jehovah was ready to respond. He encouraged me to include Jehovah in my decision. Patients

00:45:38.679 --> 00:45:44.280
is not easy for me, but I decided to look to Jehovah to provide the right job,

00:45:49.320 --> 00:46:21.960
so every day I kept looking, but work never came. I never thought that it would go on

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:30.039
so long. Eventually, I had to go on unemployment insurance so we could get by.

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:40.039
I knew that I was doing the right thing, but I couldn't help feeling that I was letting my family

00:46:40.039 --> 00:47:00.010
down. One night, I was reminded of Jesus words in Matthew chapter 6. Observe intently the birds of

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:08.489
heaven. They do not so seed or reap or gather into storehouses, yet your heavenly Father feeds them.

00:47:09.449 --> 00:47:18.809
Are you not worth more than they are? I realized that I was still relying on myself,

00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:28.139
and not fully throwing my anxiety on Jehovah. My skills may be limited, but Jehovah's are not.

00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:38.699
So I kept on looking, but I used my extra time to auxiliary pioneer. It was just what I needed.

00:47:39.659 --> 00:47:45.900
Eventually, Jehovah opened the door and blessed my patience with a job that was nearby

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:51.340
with good hours for my meetings. I even had more time for the ministry with my family.

00:47:52.699 --> 00:47:58.539
It was not an easy experience, but my faith in Jehovah was stronger than ever.

00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:08.219
I saw him act in my behalf, and I know that he really does care for me and my family.

00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:21.619
Did you notice how the brother honored Jehovah with his valuable things? For one,

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:30.019
he sacrificed his job, so as not to interfere with spiritual activities. And second,

00:48:30.739 --> 00:48:38.099
although he was unemployed, he took the opportunity to auxiliary pioneer. He was balanced,

00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:44.179
keeping his spiritual focus while diligently seeking other employment.

00:48:45.219 --> 00:48:51.460
Jehovah made sure that the brother and his family had what they needed. And in time,

00:48:52.179 --> 00:49:00.900
he was blessed with another job. Although many of our construction projects are the result of growth

00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:09.780
in a branch territory, our donations also are put to good use when disaster strike.

00:49:10.739 --> 00:49:16.659
The organization is quick to respond to the needs of our brothers and sisters in affected areas.

00:49:17.699 --> 00:49:26.019
This includes the distribution of release supplies. It also involves helping our brothers repair

00:49:26.019 --> 00:49:36.659
or rebuild their homes and kingdom halls. This was the case in 2011 when a large tornado ripped

00:49:36.659 --> 00:49:45.829
through the state of Missouri in the United States. When a disaster strikes, the disaster relief

00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:51.349
does takes the lead in caring for the needs of the field. This is done by using volunteers.

00:49:51.349 --> 00:49:55.750
Our brothers know how to work together. We're using volunteers that are used to crawling over each

00:49:55.750 --> 00:50:01.349
other and working in a kingdom hall. So they have the ability to get into a disaster situation

00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:07.349
and take direction and just take care of it. It's an evaluation process to see what's needed.

00:50:07.909 --> 00:50:12.550
Then the purchasing department locally will then go ahead and start buying materials. Those will

00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:18.309
be delivered and volunteers will come to prepare the home back to livable conditions so that our

00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:23.670
brothers and sisters can get back into their homes. So we stabilize the friends, we stabilize the

00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:28.309
houses and we can stabilize the congregation. We had a group of brothers that went in to

00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:33.909
drop them as early after the tornado destroyed 30% of the city. We had probably 30, 40 volunteers

00:50:33.909 --> 00:50:40.070
working on the house and a woman comes down the street from the neighborhood. She sees all the

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:45.510
volunteers working. She thinks it's a construction organization. She says, can I pay you to come over

00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:50.710
and fix my garage? It was basically a shed that had been picked up off the slab and turned

00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:55.750
upside down and moved a few feet away from the slab. So the brothers said, well, let's go take a

00:50:55.750 --> 00:51:00.789
look at it. So they went over and they took a look at it and it wasn't that hard. The shed was

00:51:00.789 --> 00:51:04.949
still intact. They said, we could do this in a few minutes. So they went and got all their volunteers.

00:51:04.949 --> 00:51:08.710
They went over, they picked the shed up. They got about 30 brothers on it and they turned it over

00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:14.550
and put it on the slab. And the woman was so thankful. She says, okay, so what do I owe you? They

00:51:14.550 --> 00:51:18.710
said, no, we're all volunteers. Where Joe is, witnesses, we're working through the local kingdom hall

00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:23.989
here, a relief center. And she says, you're kidding me. You're all volunteers. She says, yeah,

00:51:23.989 --> 00:51:29.030
and we're out. She says, what are you doing here? So we're out working on our brothers and sisters

00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:34.230
homes and trying to help them get stabilized. She was in tears. She came back down the street a few

00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:39.829
minutes later with a lot of money in her hand. She said, I want to tell you a story. She says, I called

00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:46.389
my church after this happened. And I asked them to come work, do this work for me to put this shed

00:51:46.389 --> 00:51:51.429
back on its slab. They said, we can do that. We'll be there in about three weeks and it's going

00:51:51.429 --> 00:51:58.150
to cost you this much. She says, and here you folks come over to my house. You don't charge me.

00:51:58.150 --> 00:52:03.429
You don't even know who I am. And you put my home back together. What I needed have done.

00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:09.030
She says, here's the money. You have this. You put it in your contribution box. When someone helps

00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:14.789
in building a kingdom hall, when someone helps in building an assembly hall, when someone

00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:23.510
aids in caring for a natural disaster, their lives are changed forever. When someone is benefited

00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:34.329
by one of these programs, their lives are changed forever. The love demonstrated in the organization

00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:42.329
is truly faith strengthening to see. The same arrangement to respond to disasters

00:52:42.969 --> 00:52:50.250
is in place all around the world. It is your contributions that make this possible.

00:52:50.969 --> 00:53:00.409
For this, we sincerely thank you. But as stated earlier, we provide help in many other ways

00:53:00.409 --> 00:53:07.849
by means of our voluntary donations. The primary focus, though, is helping people spiritually.

00:53:08.809 --> 00:53:16.329
In contrast to Jova's organization, many publishing companies do not provide literature for the

00:53:16.329 --> 00:53:26.329
blind. Why? Well, they've determined that it has not cost effective. However, Jova wants

00:53:26.329 --> 00:53:34.969
everyone to have a hope for the future. Notice how our organization works hard to make the truth

00:53:34.969 --> 00:53:46.409
more readily available for those who are blind. I can't wait to see birds. I can't wait to see

00:53:46.409 --> 00:53:52.570
their little beaks chirp when I hear the sound of them. I was fully sighted until I was nine,

00:53:52.570 --> 00:54:00.250
and then gradually started losing my sight. When I was young, I loved skiing. I skied and enjoyed

00:54:00.329 --> 00:54:08.250
the outdoors. We're really very busy in our life. We have my mother who's 85 and my aunt who's 92

00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:16.969
that live here also. So we have their lives to work around doctors and meals. We have our Theocratic

00:54:16.969 --> 00:54:27.210
life, and we have our studies, our field service, our personal study. I lead a very, very full life. I

00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:37.929
just happened to be blind. In my early 30s, I lost the use of my right eye. It was quite sudden,

00:54:37.929 --> 00:54:44.090
and I went to the doctor and following the examination. He took me into his office and let me know that

00:54:44.090 --> 00:54:52.889
I would be blind in both eyes, and its immediate response by me was fear. But it was the ministry

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:59.769
that gave me the greatest strength and confidence to go forward. Throughout the United States branch

00:54:59.769 --> 00:55:05.210
territory, there are about 20 million persons that are either blind or suffer from low vision.

00:55:06.010 --> 00:55:12.090
And in response to that, the organization has produced braille literature and a number of languages,

00:55:12.730 --> 00:55:17.929
also audio files, as well as electronic screen reader files.

00:55:18.730 --> 00:55:26.969
Our principal function is to transcribe publications into braille. The transcription is done

00:55:26.969 --> 00:55:34.329
electronically by a program that has been produced in-house and is part of the Watchtower

00:55:34.329 --> 00:55:41.769
translation system. We produce braille files that can be embossed into paper publications.

00:55:42.730 --> 00:55:50.730
The screen reader and no-taker files are uploaded to the JW.org website

00:55:50.730 --> 00:55:56.250
for use by blind and visually impaired persons. Not being able to read

00:55:57.929 --> 00:56:06.489
and having to learn to get the spiritual truths in in a different way is quite a challenge.

00:56:06.570 --> 00:56:14.889
That's where the audio recordings being able to hear, I am able to do exactly what I used to.

00:56:15.369 --> 00:56:23.210
First Corinthians 9.22 says, I have become all things to people of all sorts that I might

00:56:23.210 --> 00:56:32.090
by all possible means save some. And we've taken those words to heart. We want persons outside of

00:56:32.090 --> 00:56:37.050
our organization to benefit from the literature that we are producing for the blind.

00:56:37.050 --> 00:56:42.489
Now after attending an expo for the blind, Janet recognized the vast potential that exists

00:56:42.489 --> 00:56:48.730
in the blind community for the good news. The amount of blind people at the expo,

00:56:48.730 --> 00:56:56.010
it was astounding. And the first thing that we thought of was these people need Jehovah.

00:56:56.010 --> 00:57:01.210
And immediately we came home and we called Bethel and told them what we saw.

00:57:01.289 --> 00:57:07.929
We appointed a sign language circuit officer to organize our participation at the event.

00:57:08.809 --> 00:57:14.809
And this was also beneficial because some persons who attended are both blind and deaf.

00:57:14.809 --> 00:57:18.170
Thus could only benefit from tactile sign language.

00:57:19.369 --> 00:57:24.969
We got together the week before and discussed how we were going to set up a table in the booth.

00:57:24.969 --> 00:57:30.969
Some blind people prefer braille and others prefer audio. So we had to have both available for them.

00:57:31.849 --> 00:57:35.530
Anything that would attract those who are blind. So they would come up to the table.

00:57:35.530 --> 00:57:43.210
They could feel the braille and literature. They could feel the visual aids. They could listen

00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:49.849
to a scripture about God's hope for the future. So everything was tailored to those who

00:57:49.849 --> 00:57:56.489
are blind or visually impaired. Our participation at these expos has been tremendously successful.

00:57:57.369 --> 00:58:02.409
Many times these individuals that are present are learning the truth for the first time.

00:58:03.210 --> 00:58:08.889
61% of the people that we talked to gave us their contact information.

00:58:09.929 --> 00:58:16.010
Everyone was very appreciative. They all enjoyed what we had to show them and teach them.

00:58:16.570 --> 00:58:21.929
Many of them left the booth with multiple pieces of literature.

00:58:22.650 --> 00:58:28.170
Some of those who approached the booth were so appreciative. They gave us hugs.

00:58:28.170 --> 00:58:32.969
They saw them sat down right then there and had their first study.

00:58:36.090 --> 00:58:41.449
It was a very special experience and it felt like we were opening a new form of ministry.

00:58:41.449 --> 00:58:45.849
It felt like we were contacting a group of people that hadn't had the opportunity to know

00:58:45.849 --> 00:58:51.449
what to hold before. They can see the truth. They can see the ring of truth in their mind's eyes.

00:58:52.250 --> 00:59:01.510
So many people thank us for being there. This ministry is really unbelievable.

00:59:02.550 --> 00:59:12.659
It's unlike anything I've done in my life. This is just one of many examples

00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:21.380
that shows how innovative witnessing initiatives can help people of all backgrounds and

00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:29.829
circumstances to draw close to Jehovah. One of our favorite segments on this program

00:59:30.869 --> 00:59:38.949
is hearing how our brothers and sisters came in contact with the truth. Oftentimes the truth

00:59:38.949 --> 00:59:45.989
completely transformed their lives. We are happy to share one such story with you now.

00:59:46.949 --> 00:59:55.269
Brother John Lewis was raised in a non-religious household. However, he was exposed to the truth

00:59:55.269 --> 01:00:05.349
at a young age. But what caused him to later draw closer to Jehovah? And how does his story tie in

01:00:05.349 --> 01:00:12.550
with our theme for this month, honor Jehovah with your valuable things? Brother Lewis himself

01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:36.659
will answer that question for us. American motorcycles for my passion. We'd make them louder,

01:00:37.539 --> 01:00:45.940
faster, and lots of chrome. It wasn't just the bike. I had a great American sports car. I had a

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:53.860
brand new house. I had a good job. Really, I had the American dream. And I had a great life. I was

01:00:53.940 --> 01:01:01.619
always looking for fun, and I always seemed to find it. Even though I thought I had everything,

01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:08.420
there was still something missing. The Vietnam War was brewing, it was raging. People were dying,

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:14.179
and it really bothered me. When I was six years old, my aunt, who just became a witness,

01:01:14.179 --> 01:01:19.059
she showed me this book. And there's a picture inside, I remember so well, it's a Varma

01:01:19.059 --> 01:01:24.579
Getten. And that scares a little kid. I thought, I don't want to be there. But a few pages later,

01:01:24.579 --> 01:01:29.619
there's a picture of the paradise. I never forgot it. Now I always thought, I wanted to be there

01:01:29.619 --> 01:01:35.699
someday. So I thought, maybe my aunt has something. What have I got to lose? So I called her and said,

01:01:35.699 --> 01:01:42.659
send over some witnesses. So I had a couple of studies with the brother, but it didn't really make

01:01:42.659 --> 01:01:51.139
sense yet, and my lifestyle hadn't changed. I was 21 right in my motorcycle, doing about 75 miles

01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:58.980
an hour, because speed limits were for whims. I hit a park truck, I nearly died. And as a result,

01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:07.860
I now use this to walk. Two days prior, I actually had witnesses over, but then my aunt invited me to

01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:15.619
a special talk given by the Watchtower Society's president in San Francisco. And I said, okay, I'll see.

01:02:15.619 --> 01:02:20.820
Well, you can remember, this time the drug culture was in full swing, and it was part of my life, too.

01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:29.380
And so I partied, got home after 2 a.m., but I tried something. I prayed to Jehovah. I said,

01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:36.900
if you're real, if this is true, give me up in the morning. Well, at 6 a.m., I woke up,

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:42.820
could not sleep, and I thought, this is really weird. And so I thought, I better go. So I went with

01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:49.860
my aunt to this function, and I thought, if nothing else, I'll just check out the chicks. Hey, I was 21,

01:02:50.739 --> 01:02:56.260
but you when I found when I got there, everybody paid attention. When they brothers said,

01:02:56.260 --> 01:03:01.219
to turn to a scripture, they all turned to that scripture. It was such a unified group of

01:03:01.219 --> 01:03:08.420
harmony, something that I always wanted. So I made rapid changes in my life. I soon qualified to go

01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:13.860
out in the public preaching. Soon after that, I was baptized. And six months later, I started in the

01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:20.579
full-time ministry. And so for over 40 years now, my wife and I have enjoyed this work of going

01:03:20.579 --> 01:03:27.699
door to door and teaching others the Bible. In 1998, I was dignified with the opportunity to serve

01:03:27.699 --> 01:03:33.219
as the Apostle Paul did, visiting and encouraging congregations. I've had the chance to do that in

01:03:33.219 --> 01:03:40.420
different parts of the United States as a traveling overseer. So really, I've gone from a life of

01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:46.579
pursuit of happiness that never found it. I tried to make it happen, but it wasn't there.

01:03:47.219 --> 01:03:54.820
Now I have a life of purpose. I have a family worldwide, and I have a secure future. What's better

01:03:54.820 --> 01:04:06.550
than that? Did you notice how Brother Lewis's story ties in with our theme for this month?

01:04:06.869 --> 01:04:15.590
Brother and sister Lewis have served in the circuit work since 1998. As special full-time

01:04:15.590 --> 01:04:25.750
servants, they are honoring Jehovah to the full with their time and energy. We truly appreciate

01:04:26.469 --> 01:04:36.019
our hard-working circuit overseers and their wives. Something that makes our literature so unique

01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:46.099
is the unity it produces. Our literature doesn't focus just on one country or one continent.

01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:53.860
Instead, it fulfills the spiritual needs of our brothers and sisters worldwide.

01:04:55.139 --> 01:05:03.860
How is that accomplished? One very important factor is that branches around the world contribute

01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:12.179
to the content that we publish. Let's visit one such branch and find out more.

01:05:17.659 --> 01:05:22.059
The governing body of Jehovah's Witnesses provides spiritual food throughout

01:05:22.059 --> 01:05:27.659
publications and websites. The writing desk supplies material to the writing department

01:05:27.659 --> 01:05:33.340
at the World Headquarters for Publication. We also archive historical material.

01:05:33.659 --> 01:05:44.010
Newspaper creepings and experiences are sorted and filed in cabinets. These are translated into

01:05:44.010 --> 01:05:50.650
English and sent to the writing department at the World Headquarters. Also, we arranged a shooting

01:05:50.650 --> 01:05:57.530
of photographs for articles. These photographs help us to get a better understanding of what is

01:05:57.530 --> 01:06:06.550
being taught. The archive team collects historical material of the witnesses in Japan,

01:06:07.110 --> 01:06:13.269
such as photos, fabrications from the early days, and other mementos which brothers have donated.

01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:21.429
We take protective measures to save these precious items from damages close by such things as

01:06:21.429 --> 01:06:28.389
light and humidity. Also, we computerize our collection of items numbering tens of thousands

01:06:28.389 --> 01:06:35.429
so that we can immediately find any of them from the database. We use these items for exhibition

01:06:35.429 --> 01:06:41.110
displays as well as video programs produced at this branch or at the World Headquarters.

01:06:43.030 --> 01:06:49.110
Like a family album of memories, the collection in the archives tells us much about our spiritual

01:06:49.110 --> 01:07:00.230
family, about their faith, courage, joys, challenges, and about Jehovah's guidance and support.

01:07:05.099 --> 01:07:12.940
After a publication is published or a video is produced, considerable effort is

01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:20.860
expended to make it available in hundreds of languages. As we mentioned earlier in the program,

01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:30.460
170 remote translation offices need to be constructed in the next two years alone.

01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:39.340
The purpose is to make sure people from all over the world have access to Bible truth.

01:07:41.739 --> 01:07:48.460
Revelation chapter 7 verse 9 speaks of a great crowd composed of many tongues or as the

01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:55.900
foodnot reads, languages. This Bible prophecy has taken on new meaning in the past century of

01:07:55.900 --> 01:08:03.500
Kingdom rule, with translation now taking place in over 700 languages. Many of these languages

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:10.539
are operating from remote translation offices or RTOs. One example is the country of Mozambique.

01:08:11.179 --> 01:08:17.180
These offices are located in the area where the language is spoken rather than at the branch.

01:08:17.979 --> 01:08:23.500
Remote translation office guidelines outline how the branch committee works along with the

01:08:23.579 --> 01:08:30.060
writing committee, publishing committee, translation services, and the worldwide design construction

01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:36.140
department in considering relocating or starting a translation team in a remote location.

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:42.939
RTOs are presently functioning in different ways in various parts of the world.

01:08:43.739 --> 01:08:48.140
At times, the personnel live in one location and work in another.

01:08:48.779 --> 01:08:55.340
This includes using full-time and part-time commuters for both translation and support services.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:03.880
The standard of facilities provided or the operation of the RTO may not be the same as the local

01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:11.479
branch. At times, the fastest way to start operation is to rent or purchase existing facilities

01:09:11.479 --> 01:09:18.439
and if needed, carry out renovation work. For example, this method was used to acquire the

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:27.609
housing units for the American Sign Language RTO in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. If building a new

01:09:27.609 --> 01:09:33.210
RTO with the only option in an area, the standard plans have been developed for use.

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:39.689
Construction servants work along with the regional design construction departments in planning

01:09:39.689 --> 01:09:45.689
a project and then traveling to the chosen location and working along with local construction

01:09:45.689 --> 01:09:55.930
servants and volunteers in building the RTO. RTO construction gives both the local brothers and

01:09:55.930 --> 01:10:02.729
construction workers the joy of knowing they also are playing a part in reaching the hearts of

01:10:02.729 --> 01:10:11.130
people in their language. The positive results in constructing RTOs is experienced by those involved

01:10:11.130 --> 01:10:17.369
in their construction and those who translate from them. We just love the project. The RTO family

01:10:17.369 --> 01:10:21.770
is so much fun to work with, it's a small family and so as we're caring for the needs of each

01:10:21.770 --> 01:10:26.409
other throughout the days and the weeks and the months, we just really find a lot of joy in it.

01:10:26.409 --> 01:10:30.810
It's been a ton of fun and we get to do it all in the shadow of a palm tree.

01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:36.649
The greatest joy is that our brothers gave off their energy and above all, they work with much

01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:45.130
happiness for Jehovah. Our recent relocation to the RTO home and office will fit so many of our

01:10:45.130 --> 01:10:52.970
translation needs going forward. It helps us to hear and to speak the language every day because

01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:59.289
we use it in the ministry and as meetings. So that helps us to translate in a way our audience

01:10:59.289 --> 01:11:05.850
can easily understand. When you go out in the ministry, you'll find that there are so many different ways

01:11:05.850 --> 01:11:12.649
something can be said so you can have flavor in your translation work as well. Attending a

01:11:12.649 --> 01:11:19.289
congregation meeting with so many deaf really helps with translation. Being in the audience when

01:11:19.289 --> 01:11:24.729
the information is presented at the meetings, a translator can see by the facial expressions of

01:11:24.729 --> 01:11:31.289
those around him if the information is clear and understandable. Seeing them comment gives us an

01:11:31.289 --> 01:11:38.890
insight into whether they really understand. In just the last few years, over 300 articles have

01:11:38.890 --> 01:11:46.649
been established worldwide. We have had of us plans for over 100 RTOs to be established in the

01:11:46.649 --> 01:11:54.729
next few years. Jehovah is truly blessing this work so that people of all languages in the most

01:11:54.729 --> 01:12:06.310
distant parts of the earth may come to know him. Our objective has always been to make our literature

01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:15.590
available to as many people as possible. Recently, a secular book fair was arranged in the city of

01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:24.710
Guadalajara in Mexico. Our brothers thought it would be the perfect opportunity to help the visitors

01:12:24.710 --> 01:12:43.420
learn more about the best book ever written. The Bibles. Preaching where the people are is crucial

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:48.619
and here there are thousands. In a short time, we can reach people that we wouldn't normally find

01:12:48.619 --> 01:12:53.659
at home. A lot of young people have visited us here. I really like how you have it set up with book

01:12:53.659 --> 01:13:02.489
summer shirts. Teenagers have a lot of questions, but they don't ask them. If God is so powerful,

01:13:02.489 --> 01:13:07.130
why does He let us suffer? That's a question that a lot of people ask themselves since we think of

01:13:07.130 --> 01:13:13.689
God as the Almighty. And a lot of times, that's why many people lose their faith. One of my students is

01:13:13.689 --> 01:13:18.729
a Jehovah's Witness. I was once able to get a hold of a copy of the book, Young People Ask,

01:13:18.729 --> 01:13:24.810
and I found the information there very interesting, very complete. It's really helped me in particular

01:13:24.810 --> 01:13:30.329
to raise my daughters. Many people were surprised to learn that our publications are distributed

01:13:30.329 --> 01:13:36.890
completely free of charge. What cut my attention is your generosity, offering publications without

01:13:36.890 --> 01:13:42.810
expecting anything in return. In fact, one person even seemed a bit annoyed. He said,

01:13:42.810 --> 01:13:48.090
how is it possible that you don't charge for this? He said, this is worth a lot. We were very

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:56.409
surprised by the public's response. Around 30,000 publications were distributed. In fact, just

01:13:56.409 --> 01:14:02.890
between volumes one and two of the book, Young People Ask, answers that work. Some 8,000 copies

01:14:02.890 --> 01:14:09.770
were placed. One of the main objectives of our booth was to draw attention to the content on

01:14:09.850 --> 01:14:17.529
our JW.org website. To begin with, what really caught my attention with the video.

01:14:18.170 --> 01:14:23.369
What has really drawn people's attention is they're being able to watch the videos for themselves

01:14:24.090 --> 01:14:31.529
that really attracts them. Kids learn through videos. So it's very important for us as humans

01:14:32.090 --> 01:14:35.130
to teach our kids values using these different tools.

01:14:35.449 --> 01:14:44.090
As parents, our duty is to mold our children to persons with good principles, good values.

01:14:45.369 --> 01:14:49.689
A teacher watched the whiteboard animation videos and that's what most impressed her.

01:14:50.489 --> 01:14:56.489
She said she's going to use them in a classroom. From what I saw, to me the site is very good,

01:14:56.489 --> 01:15:02.810
very educational. I think it's great. You can help thousands of people right from the intimacy

01:15:02.810 --> 01:15:08.810
of their homes, or they're comfortable to consult Bible-based information. If they had knocked

01:15:08.810 --> 01:15:13.529
on my door, I probably would have shouldn't on them. But I think this method is very different.

01:15:13.529 --> 01:15:18.329
To me, it's a lot more dynamic. I was one of those persons who would just take the literature and

01:15:18.329 --> 01:15:23.449
I was like, just leave it with me. Maybe I'll read it later. I think that when we get a hold of

01:15:23.449 --> 01:15:29.130
a tablet or a laptop and we start opening web pages and especially the Jehovah's Witnesses site,

01:15:29.210 --> 01:15:33.930
you start seeing what you need without having to ask questions and especially because the pages

01:15:33.930 --> 01:15:38.810
are so eye-catching. What's happening here is really important and I think what you people are

01:15:38.810 --> 01:15:44.729
doing is great. I was a completely different person before but this has helped my family to be

01:15:44.729 --> 01:16:16.949
more united. But fine results will undoubtedly come from this new initiative. The Central

01:16:16.949 --> 01:16:22.869
America branch received approval from the service committee of the governing body for this event.

01:16:23.829 --> 01:16:34.979
Such requests are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. We discussed earlier the new program

01:16:34.979 --> 01:16:40.500
for the entire brotherhood to share and funding the building of Kingdom Halls.

01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:49.300
Congregations with less financial resources would otherwise never be able to afford to build

01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:58.340
an appropriate Kingdom Hall. But with our joint efforts, it is possible and very much appreciated.

01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:07.220
The fact is highlighted in this report that was recently given to the Bethel families

01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:14.260
in the United States and Canada. This year, Leonard and I had the privilege to travel to

01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:23.300
Southeast Africa and visit the branches in Madagascar, Mauritius and Zimbabwe. Our first

01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:31.699
stop was Madagascar. Madagascar is simply a wonderful branch for preaching. There are 30,400

01:17:31.699 --> 01:17:38.659
publishers conducting over 79,000 Bible studies. What helps is that the Madagascar people have a

01:17:38.659 --> 01:17:44.979
tremendous appreciation and respect for the Bible. It is not uncommon for individuals to give a

01:17:44.979 --> 01:17:50.340
donation for our literature with the last bit of money they have in their pockets, even if it

01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:56.260
means that they will have no money for the next day. Their typical response is, it's okay,

01:17:56.979 --> 01:18:04.500
it's for God. And that level of appreciation has resulted in many progressive Bible studies.

01:18:05.699 --> 01:18:11.220
One experience involved an elderly pastor named Lefty. He met Jehovah's Witnesses for the first

01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:16.500
time in a neighboring village about 20 miles away from where he lived. He readily accepted a

01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:21.619
Bible study and even urged members in his church to travel to the meetings with him when they

01:18:21.619 --> 01:18:30.979
could. Well, sadly, Lefty became sick and died. However, before his death, he instructed the 74

01:18:30.979 --> 01:18:36.579
members of his church that they should never leave Jehovah's Witnesses because they really read

01:18:36.579 --> 01:18:42.739
and studied the Bible and they truly have the true religion. He even left his house for them to

01:18:42.739 --> 01:18:50.579
use as a place for worship. Well, did they heed his advice? They did. Every Sunday, a group would

01:18:50.579 --> 01:18:55.939
meet together in Lefty's house and with no one to study the Bible with them and not always

01:18:55.939 --> 01:19:01.380
able to travel to 20 miles to the neighboring village, they took whatever watchtowers they had

01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:07.220
and each week someone delivered a talk on one of the articles. They knew a few Kingdoms songs

01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:12.420
from attending the meetings, so they just sung what they remembered. Two months ago,

01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:18.180
special pioneers were sent to this village. This picture shows many of the children who live in

01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:24.340
the village and that's Lefty's house in the background. The pioneers reported that 78 people

01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:29.939
were regularly attending the meetings in Lefty's house. They found that some in the group were drunkards,

01:19:30.659 --> 01:19:38.340
smokers, tradition followers, but they had all made changes in their lives from what they read

01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:44.260
reading the watchtower. The house built by Lefty was now too small. They had to use a public school

01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:49.539
for the meetings. And of course, when the pioneers came, Bible studies were started right away.

01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:55.939
In fact, the folks in this village were so excited about studying the Bible that instead of waiting

01:19:55.939 --> 01:20:02.020
for the pioneers to come to their home, they all went to the home of the pioneers. They sit in the

01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:07.300
yard and they check in just like a doctor's office and they sit and wait until it's their turn to

01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:12.899
study. It really is a beautiful thing to see how Jehovah can draw his people to him.

01:20:13.859 --> 01:20:20.100
One of the highlights of this visit were the children who came to the branch to sing or record the

01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:26.420
Malagasy rendition of song number 95, which is Taste and Sea that Jehovah is good. And as you know,

01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:32.739
this song was recently posted on JW.org. So we thought you might enjoy seeing part of that rehearsal.

01:20:33.539 --> 01:21:40.340
Our next stop was Mauritius. The first Bethel in Mauritius was established in 1988. But since 1997,

01:21:40.899 --> 01:21:46.659
they relocated to the beautiful facilities that you see here in the pictures. And there are 40

01:21:46.659 --> 01:21:52.260
brothers and sisters that make up the Bethel family. The women are truly a large army in Mauritius

01:21:52.899 --> 01:22:00.100
of the nearly 1,800 publishers, 116 are pioneers and on that number over 100 are sisters.

01:22:00.739 --> 01:22:06.420
They work so hard to carry out their ministry and they engage in various forms from public

01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:12.100
witnessing to preaching in the mountains. And Jehovah is truly blessing their efforts. They are

01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:19.140
doing this with much good success. Much of the work in the Mauritius branch involves translations

01:22:19.859 --> 01:22:24.819
and something that has had a tremendous impact on the brothers was receiving for the first time

01:22:24.819 --> 01:22:32.260
the songbook in their native language, Mauritian Creole. And a number were able to express their

01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:39.060
feelings of appreciation. Jehovah has blessed us so much. I'm so grateful. It's a wonderful gift

01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:44.180
from Jehovah. We've got the songbook on our mother tongue. We can really praise Jehovah. We are

01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:49.460
very happy that we've got the songbook on our mother tongue. Our final stop was in Bobway.

01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:55.220
Zimbabwe continues to be a buzz from the success of last year's International Convention.

01:22:55.220 --> 01:23:00.979
And evidence of this has been the amount of increase in many aspects of the ministry. This includes

01:23:00.979 --> 01:23:07.699
all-time peaks in magazine placements, Bible studies, and memorial attendance. One nice experience

01:23:07.699 --> 01:23:13.300
involves a 20-year-old young woman named Blessed. She obtained literature for one of our preaching

01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:18.340
cards and she was drawn to the truth right away. She was a progressive student and quickly began

01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:24.340
attending the meetings. In fact, Blessed was so touched by what she saw and heard at the meetings.

01:23:24.340 --> 01:23:30.340
It moved her to approach a sister in the congregation and expressed to her just how fortunate she was to

01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:36.020
be raised by Christian parents. When Blessed was given the invitation to attend the convention,

01:23:36.020 --> 01:23:41.220
she readily accepted. But imagine the scene on the first day of the convention

01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:48.100
when she bumps into her parents during the intermission. Both were equally surprised to see the other.

01:23:48.739 --> 01:23:53.939
But Blessed was so excited. She began interrogating her father with a barrage of questions.

01:23:53.939 --> 01:23:58.659
And so she started asking him, well, what are you doing here? Who in mind is you? How did you know

01:23:58.659 --> 01:24:03.779
about this? Why did you never say anything? Well, the father could not bear the interrogation

01:24:03.859 --> 01:24:11.220
anymore and he eventually confessed, your mother and I are Jehovah's Witnesses. We've been

01:24:11.220 --> 01:24:15.539
inactive since you were born. In fact, your mother used to serve as a regular pioneer.

01:24:16.739 --> 01:24:21.460
What is your going to imagine the young woman was in total disbelief and later admitted just how

01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:25.779
angry she was at her parents for not raising her and her siblings in the truth.

01:24:26.899 --> 01:24:32.420
But this motivated her to progress even more. In four months, she qualified to become an unbaptized

01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:37.779
publisher. She ended her relationship with her boyfriend, even had the courage to terminate her

01:24:37.779 --> 01:24:42.739
employment since she worked for an organization that was against Bible principles. She became

01:24:42.739 --> 01:24:49.779
baptized and the best part is her parents who were clearly affected by her example have since been

01:24:49.779 --> 01:24:55.220
reactivated. Even one of her siblings who used to make fun of her for studying the Bible is now

01:24:55.220 --> 01:25:01.140
an unbaptized publisher. Another aspect of the work that is meeting with good success is the

01:25:01.140 --> 01:25:07.060
building of Kingdom Halls. It is very difficult to get construction servants into Zimbabwe so much

01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:13.300
of the work is done by local brothers and as you'll know it from these clips, the work that they

01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:20.659
have been able to accomplish is tremendous. Currently, a Kingdom Hall can be completed in six weeks

01:25:20.659 --> 01:25:27.699
in the rural areas and two to three months in other locations. And over the past year,

01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:33.939
12 Kingdom Halls have been built and another 115 are scheduled across the country.

01:25:35.909 --> 01:25:41.430
It was a rainy season in Zimbabwe during the week of the branch visit and it rained all day

01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:47.670
every day and some of the hardest rains were on the day of the special program. But despite

01:25:47.670 --> 01:25:56.069
the inclement conditions, 29,411 were in attendance and it was just so touching to see so many paying

01:25:56.069 --> 01:26:03.750
attention and all the smiling joyful faces despite the unfavorable conditions. It even moved

01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:08.710
one news reporter who was there covering the program to ask, what is it about you people?

01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:15.430
How is it that this many people would come together to sit in the rain, to listen to some talks

01:26:15.430 --> 01:26:21.189
about the Bible? Well, the brothers quickly arranged for someone to follow up on his interest.

01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:27.909
The visit to these branches was evidence that Jehovah is accomplishing wonderful things and

01:26:27.909 --> 01:26:33.029
blessing the work and the diligent efforts of his people. And all along the way, the brothers

01:26:33.029 --> 01:26:38.310
and sisters enthusiastically expressed their love and appreciation for Jehovah to the governing

01:26:38.310 --> 01:26:42.949
body and all of the hard work that is being done and accomplished by the Beltal families here in

01:26:42.949 --> 01:26:48.069
the United States as well as in Canada. And it is such a privilege to be able to pass on to you

01:26:48.149 --> 01:26:59.609
their warm love and greetings. Don't you agree that this program has provided us with a number of

01:26:59.609 --> 01:27:08.890
examples of how we can honor Jehovah with our valuable things? Yes, we can give of our time,

01:27:09.850 --> 01:27:19.050
our skills and other resources to further kingdom interest. As a summary, we will enjoy

01:27:19.770 --> 01:27:30.890
beautiful music video entitled, yes, you guessed it, honor Jehovah with your valuable things.

01:28:12.090 --> 01:28:24.069
Here's what I will do. I'll give to you Jehovah the best I have to give.

01:28:25.029 --> 01:29:00.819
I'll live for you Jehovah as long as I may live. No matter my valuable life and I treasure the joy

01:29:00.899 --> 01:29:23.659
that it pray. One more can I do to give long and to give you. Yes, I know. So with each day that

01:29:23.659 --> 01:30:15.380
prays, but I will do as long as I may live. Proverbs 39 are etched in our minds and hearts

01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:22.340
after this month's program. We want to give our first fruits to Jehovah.

01:30:23.300 --> 01:30:30.819
May all of us take the time to prayerfully consider what we can do to continue to live up to our

01:30:30.819 --> 01:30:38.659
dedication to Jehovah in all of the areas we have discussed. To conclude our program,

01:30:39.539 --> 01:30:46.979
we would like to share these greetings from the Tallinn North congregation in the country of

01:30:46.979 --> 01:30:58.340
Estonia. The 101 publishers meet in a kingdom hall in the Medieval Old Town. Their territory

01:30:58.340 --> 01:31:05.220
is visited every year by thousands of tourists and foreign students and the congregation makes full

01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:14.260
use of literature carts in their ministry. There are 14 congregations in the city of Tallinn

01:31:14.260 --> 01:31:22.340
that meet in three separate kingdom hall complexes. The work in Estonia is supervised by the Finland

01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:30.579
branch, but there is a remote translation office in the country, which also hosts classes of the

01:31:30.579 --> 01:31:39.300
School for Kingdom Evangelizers. Students come from nearby countries such as Finland and Russia.

01:31:40.739 --> 01:31:48.180
Although these images were recorded earlier this year when it was colder, a special convention

01:31:48.180 --> 01:31:55.859
is planned in Tallinn this summer, when it will be much warmer. Our Estonian brothers and sisters

01:31:55.939 --> 01:32:04.020
are giving of their valuable things and preparing to welcome the international delegates

01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:15.460
when they arrive in July. We love you all very much and thank you for joining us this month.

01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:22.260
This is JW Broadcasting from Brooklyn, New York.
