00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.679
Are you not already willing and ready to serve, cooperate, and refresh?

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:10.400
Of course you are.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.119
So I have a talk on this now.

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:16.519
Well, for one thing, we're not going to see you for a while.

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:23.940
But more importantly, that willingness you have today to serve, cooperate, and refresh

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.199
is going to be put to the test.

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:36.799
But with sudden changes or discouragement, undesirable circumstances, unexpected challenges

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:48.460
and problems, lack of support or recognition, any of the above, all of the above, and

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.899
that's exactly what happened to an individual in the first century in Corinth.

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.219
The Apostle Paul had founded the congregation in Corinth, and he mentions this individual.

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:08.120
In his letter, in 1 Corinthians 116, who is it?

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:18.049
1 Corinthians 116, yes, I also baptize the household of Steffanus.

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:19.049
Who Steffanus?

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.930
Why does Paul mention him?

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:29.569
Steffanus in his household, that's his family, it could also include slaves, employees,

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:31.090
they all take the truth.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.010
He did the beginning when Paul is there founding the congregation.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:42.730
Paul stays in Corinth for about a year and a half to stabilize the congregation.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.129
So Steffanus learns first hand from Paul.

00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:53.489
He receives not five months of training, but some 18 months.

00:01:53.489 --> 00:02:00.689
Learning who Jesus Christ was, how to be Christ-like as he looked at the Apostle Paul's example,

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.370
what fine training.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.890
But then things changed.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:14.770
Paul went on to Ephesus, and in a very short time, serious problems developed in Corinth,

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:21.289
a shocking case of immorality being tolerated in the congregation for some time.

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:25.610
Brothers causing divisions, saying, I belong to Paul, will I to a Paulos?

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:33.539
But for me, it's Peter, and you had brothers taking brothers to court over personal matters.

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:42.259
And many other serious problems developing, how Steffanus doing, is he bearing up?

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:47.860
Is he using the training he got from Paul to handle these situations?

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.300
Or did he become part of the problem, saying, will I belong to Paul?

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.740
He baptized me.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.219
Well, we find out.

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:02.699
As five years after the congregation was formed, that's right, five years after Steffanus

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:09.900
was baptized, here he is with two other brothers, going to Ephesus to meet Paul and report

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.539
what's happening in Corinth.

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:13.979
What do we see in this Christian?

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:16.500
Well, Paul tells us.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:30.659
Now go to chapter 16, 1 Corinthians 16, verse 15, now I urge you, brothers, you know

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.340
that the household of Steffanus is the first fruits of Ekea?

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.780
Yes, we know that.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.340
He baptized him in his household early on, but here it is.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.020
And they devoted themselves to ministering to the Holy Ones.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.860
They devoted themselves to ministering to the Holy Ones.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.219
What does that mean?

00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:04.419
The minister means one who does not let up in humbly serving others, does not let up that

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:12.460
indicates resistance, challenge, problems, but he does not let up in serving others.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.460
And who is he serving?

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.460
The Holy Ones.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.060
This is not an elite group of prominent people.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.259
All the brothers and sisters were anointed with Holy Spirit, so they were all Holy Ones,

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:26.939
like Steffanus, but these were the same ones taking each other to court.

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:32.180
They had a fleshly view of things, not a spiritual view, and they were tolerating immorality

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:43.459
in the congregation, yet Steffanus is determined to humbly serve all of his brothers and sisters.

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:46.500
Let's read verse 16.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:53.540
May you also keep submitting yourselves to people like that, like who, like Steffanus,

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.939
and to all those cooperating and working hard.

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:03.139
Paul is urging the congregation to submit to Steffanus.

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:05.459
Why does he have to urge them?

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:14.639
Could it be Steffanus was not getting the support or the recognition that he needed, regardless?

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:21.560
Steffanus is determined to minister to his brothers.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.759
Paul says that Steffanus also cooperated.

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:26.319
How's that?

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:29.319
Remember, Steffanus didn't come alone to see Paul.

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:33.759
The next verse tells you that there's two others that came with him.

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:40.079
And in chapter 7, Paul writes that he is answering questions that the brothers wrote to him.

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:43.139
So there's a letter.

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:48.100
Steffanus and his friends may have brought that letter to Paul.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.939
So what do we see here in Steffanus?

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:56.620
He's not a maverick, a lone wolf out on a personal campaign.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.899
He's cooperating with the brothers.

00:05:59.899 --> 00:06:05.980
Brothers that up until now were mishandling serious issues in the congregation.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:11.740
In addition to a letter, Steffanus is there in person to give accurate details and more

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.259
information to Paul.

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:19.420
So Paul has the whole story about what's going on in Corinth.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:26.740
That is, Steffanus was cooperating with theocratic arrangements, such as they were.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.779
Such as they were.

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:35.100
How do you know that Steffanus didn't just go to meet Paul to complain and criticize

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.420
how everything's being mishandled?

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.199
You know, there's always something that like to complain and criticize, and they stand

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:43.819
and watch and see what happens.

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:46.620
Was that Steffanus?

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:51.220
Was his report accurate to Paul or was he just giving his side of the story to gain Paul's

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.220
favor?

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:59.490
Well, Paul tells us in the next two verses, 17 and 18.

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:05.730
But I rejoice over the presence of Steffanus and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because they

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:14.730
have made up for you're not being here, for they have refreshed my spirit and yours,

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:19.370
therefore give recognition to men of that sort.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.370
So what do you think?

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:29.089
If Steffanus was biased and critical, do you think Paul would have found him refreshing?

00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:31.449
You know Paul's character.

00:07:31.449 --> 00:07:33.970
He would have counseled him, no.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:38.689
He counseled Peter some years earlier and Antioch, did he not?

00:07:38.689 --> 00:07:39.689
No.

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:42.730
Steffanus was truly refreshing.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:48.970
His report likely served to dispel at least some of Paul's concerns about Corinth.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:56.850
Imagine being able to be refreshing to the apostle Paul.

00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:02.769
But Paul says, he refreshed my spirit and yours, that's the congregation.

00:08:02.769 --> 00:08:04.769
How so?

00:08:04.769 --> 00:08:07.490
Well first Steffanus takes action, doesn't he?

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:11.329
He doesn't just stand by and complain.

00:08:11.329 --> 00:08:14.290
But he doesn't try to resolve things on his own.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:16.490
He cooperates with the brothers.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:23.089
He comes with them and he provides information to Paul.

00:08:23.089 --> 00:08:29.730
And he along with others explains the situation to Paul and then brings the answers back with

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:33.370
him to assist the congregation.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:42.529
How refreshing to the congregation to have one like Steffanus.

00:08:42.529 --> 00:08:50.610
Because Steffanus kept ministering to cooperating with and refreshing others, he was a mature

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:54.730
stabilizing influence on the congregation.

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:59.850
He remembered Jesus Christ is the head of the congregation.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:04.090
And he humbly followed theocratic direction.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:11.850
So under inspiration, the apostle Paul could write a powerful, accurate letter so on point

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:15.409
that we're still benefiting from his counsel today.

00:09:15.409 --> 00:09:21.009
Steffanus and his friends likely had just such a letter in his hand as he went back to

00:09:21.009 --> 00:09:27.370
the congregation and then humbly helped the brothers to apply the counsel.

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:33.919
Within a few months, things had really improved in court.

00:09:33.919 --> 00:09:38.919
There are only four verses to describe Steffanus.

00:09:38.919 --> 00:09:45.799
If only four verses were allotted to describe you in five years from now, what would you

00:09:45.799 --> 00:09:49.279
like them to say?

00:09:49.279 --> 00:09:53.039
Steffanus is a fine example to imitate.

00:09:53.039 --> 00:10:00.639
Do not let up in serving your brothers, all your brothers.

00:10:00.639 --> 00:10:08.759
Look for the quiet ones, the downtrodden, cooperate with theocratic arrangements such as they

00:10:08.759 --> 00:10:10.759
are.

00:10:10.759 --> 00:10:17.879
Recognize those that went ahead of you and also working hard.

00:10:17.879 --> 00:10:22.759
Publishers, pioneers, missionaries, beth lights, the ones who fought the earlier battles

00:10:22.759 --> 00:10:30.289
of faith and brought theocracy to the level that it is now.

00:10:30.289 --> 00:10:32.450
Be refreshing.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:36.129
Even in the face of serious problems, tell the facts as they are.

00:10:36.129 --> 00:10:41.169
Don't embellish or hide pertinent information just to look good.

00:10:41.169 --> 00:10:44.809
lish the apostle Paul's in the area.

00:10:44.809 --> 00:10:50.129
But don't forget those who are toiling and loaded down.

00:10:50.129 --> 00:10:57.289
What tremendous good you will accomplish in your assignment when, despite change, challenges,

00:10:57.289 --> 00:11:03.649
problems, you remain a Steffanus as you serve, cooperate and refresh.
