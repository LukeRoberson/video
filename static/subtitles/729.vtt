00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:12.210
I know you agree, your Gilead training has been a gift, a gift from Jehovah, Jesus Christ,

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.890
and the faithful and discreet slave.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:22.809
Have you thought about how you're going to share your gift and allow others to benefit

00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:27.690
from your training when you return to your assignment?

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.089
It's a good question.

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:36.409
When we get back to the busyness of a routine, perhaps the stress and anxieties of increased

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:43.369
responsibility, sharing a gift may be the last thing on your mind.

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:46.170
So it's good to think about it now.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:57.890
What will help you to strengthen, encourage, motivate, and instruct those who you oversee,

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.210
your workmates, your brothers and sisters in the congregation?

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.090
We can learn much from the way Jesus dealt with people.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.250
Like you, Jesus was entrusted with a beautiful gift.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.810
Unlike you and me, Jesus had some amazing abilities.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.290
For example, he could read hearts.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.930
The scriptures describe an occasion when Jesus responded to a man's thoughts rather

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.489
than to his words.

00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:39.010
Do you think Jesus' ability to know what his audience was thinking and feeling enhanced

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.290
his effectiveness as he shared his gift?

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.290
Of course.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.890
But interestingly, the scriptures reveal that Jesus dignified people in the way he communicated

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.530
with them.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:05.170
He often asked meaningful questions and listened attentively to the answers before he shared

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.730
his gift.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:14.729
For a few minutes this morning, let's consider two occasions when Jesus did just that.

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:22.729
When doing so, we'll get some pointers that will assist you to be effective in sharing

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:26.330
your gift of Gilead training.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.849
The first account is found in the Bible book of Mark, chapter 10.

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.889
Let's turn there to gather.

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:43.129
Mark, chapter 10, beginning in verse 35, James and John, the sons of Zebedee, approached

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:51.770
him and said to him, teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:59.050
He said to them, what do you want me to do for you?

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.169
They replied, grant us to sit down one at your right hand and one at your left in your

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:08.490
glory.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:16.050
The parallel account in Matthew reveals that James and John did not approach Jesus on their

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.729
own.

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:21.330
They had their mother do it for them.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:33.129
Do you think as this woman approached Jesus, he knew what she wanted, probably.

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.250
How did he deal with her?

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.969
Did he interrupt her?

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:38.810
Reprimand her?

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.930
No.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:49.289
Instead he asked a question, what do you want me to do for you?

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:58.210
The second account is just a few verses down, Mark chapter 10, beginning in verse 46.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.610
Here we learn about a blind beggar named Bartimaeus.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:09.289
He sat by the road and when he heard that Jesus was passing by, he called out.

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:14.370
Son of David, Jesus, have mercy on me.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:20.730
The crowd tried to quiet him, but Bartimaeus called out even more loudly.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:27.689
Jesus stopped and said, bring him to me.

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:34.699
Now Bartimaeus had an audience with the Son of God.

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:38.500
How did Jesus address Bartimaeus?

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:47.500
In verse 51, Jesus said to him, what do you want me to do for you?

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:54.300
The blind man said to him, rebony, let me recover my sight.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.259
And Jesus said to him, go, your faith has made you well.

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:08.790
And immediately he recovered his sight and he began to follow Jesus on the road.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.509
What do you want me to do for you?

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:19.399
The same question in both accounts, very different situations.

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:23.040
Why do you think Jesus asked this question?

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.879
Well, he accomplished at least four things.

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:30.040
What were they?

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:40.420
Well, first of all, he dignified his audience by encouraging communication.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:49.660
Number two, he allowed his audience to reveal what was in his or her heart,

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:55.740
to put it on the table as it were.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:02.699
In his dealings with James and John, the question actually protected Jesus

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:11.860
and gave him an opportunity to give those two apostles a valuable lesson in modesty.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:19.170
This matter of giving the right and left places in the kingdom is not mine to give.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:26.769
Finally, in the case of Bartimaeus, would you agree the question provided opportunity

00:06:26.769 --> 00:06:33.930
to strengthen Bartimaeus' faith and to give him effective assistance?

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:41.290
Allowing Bartimaeus to articulate his desire, what do you want?

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.889
And then to experience the immediate realization,

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:50.050
would have left no doubt in Bartimaeus' mind that he had been considered.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.170
And how did it affect him?

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:59.410
Well, the account says he began to follow Jesus on the road.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:10.579
It's a beautiful example of asking a question that helps you to share your gift.

00:07:10.579 --> 00:07:13.779
When I was a newly appointed circuit overseer,

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:19.060
the elders in a congregation that I was serving expressed concern about a sister

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.459
who was missing meetings.

00:07:21.459 --> 00:07:25.019
They asked me if I would be willing to make a shepherding visit.

00:07:25.019 --> 00:07:27.819
Of course, I was happy to do that.

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:32.660
The arrangements were made, another elder accompanied me,

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:39.300
and I shared all of the appropriate verses about meeting attendants.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:44.980
The sister listened, and as we were leaving, she looked me in the eye,

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:50.649
and she said, you don't have a clue.

00:07:50.649 --> 00:07:55.170
At the time, I thought she was being disrespectful.

00:07:55.170 --> 00:08:03.889
But as I thought about it, I came to wish that instead of showing up with all the appropriate verses,

00:08:03.889 --> 00:08:08.970
I had showed up with all of the appropriate questions.

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:12.569
What do you want me to do for you?

00:08:12.569 --> 00:08:14.449
How may I help?

00:08:14.449 --> 00:08:18.410
What's been happening in your life?

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:26.490
Those kinds of questions allow you to render meaningful assistance.

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:29.009
I learned from that experience.

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:32.289
I hope you can learn from my mistake.

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:38.730
Don't make the mistake of thinking you know what a person wants or needs.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:48.309
Jesus did know, and he still asked questions.

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:56.269
Didn't I, the audience, allow your listener to reveal what is in his or her heart?

00:08:56.269 --> 00:09:03.429
It may protect you, and it allows you to render meaningful assistance.

00:09:03.429 --> 00:09:08.669
Approach your assignment the way Jesus approached his.

00:09:08.669 --> 00:09:12.389
What do you want me to do for you?

00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:17.710
If you do, not only will you effectively share your gift,

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:21.230
you will be a gift wherever you serve.
