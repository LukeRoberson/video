I'm Ingrid McGarr. I live right around the block, just a couple of miles from here in Eagle Valley.

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:15.519
And I worked on this site at International Nickel in their metallurgical research lab for 18 years.

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:22.519
Two years after they built the lab, I came and I was here until they closed in 1984.

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.519
So it was great fun to come over here and see this site.

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.519
And I'm delighted with what's happened to this site.

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:38.520
It stood empty for so long and was a big question of what was going to happen to it.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.520
And it is a beautiful spot and you've enhanced it.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:50.520
I mean, I love the grounds. I love the environmental concern that you've had with developing it

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.520
and keeping the natural areas and so on. I'm delighted because I've been worked here for that long.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.520
I have fond memories of what it was like on a much smaller scale.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.519
But seeing the lake, my lab was basically very close to this position.

00:01:08.519 --> 00:01:15.519
My desk looked out on that lake. And so to see it now and see the grounds really with the rocks along the edge of the lake

00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:22.519
and so on, much like they were when I worked here is delightful.

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:27.519
I wasn't picturing it to be quite this way, I think.

00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:36.519
So much today is level everything, put down sod and build a building and not keep anything natural.

00:01:36.519 --> 00:01:41.519
It's delightful that you've done that. Very delightful.

00:01:41.519 --> 00:01:47.519
I had founded an international medical research group when they closed the lab.

00:01:47.519 --> 00:01:55.519
And I've kept it going for 30 years and we had our last reunion in 2014, every five years I've had a reunion.

00:01:55.519 --> 00:02:04.519
So I'm hoping after seeing the facility to arrange something because they were very curious in 2014 as to what was happening to the site.

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:14.520
And I would love to be able to have a tour here with the research group to see what you've done with the property.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.520
So I'm excited about that. I'm really hoping to work on that in the future.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:29.520
I think you're good neighbors. You're compassionate, you're caring, you care about the environment, you care about the community.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.520
And I think we are very fortunate to have you as our neighbors.
