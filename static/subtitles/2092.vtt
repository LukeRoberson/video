00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:08.279
As Jehovah's Witnesses, we preach to people wherever we find them.

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:14.279
Today, our literature carts and displays are a common sight all over the world.

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:17.280
But how did public witnessing get started?

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:24.280
We'll explore this story of courage and innovation on this episode of Our History in Motion.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:30.219
Jesus set the precedent for public witnessing.

00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:34.219
He taught in the main streets and along the road.

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.219
The Apostle Paul and other first century Christians followed that courageous pattern.

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:46.369
Jehovah's Monoday people follow a similar example.

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:50.369
In the late 1800s, the Bible students, as we were called back then,

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:54.369
published a booklet called The Bible Versus Evolution.

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:58.369
The goal? To distribute over 300,000 copies.

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:02.369
But there was only a small group of Bible students at the time.

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:05.370
How could they distribute that much literature?

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:12.510
The April 15th, 1899 issue of the Watchtower sent out a call.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.510
Volunteers wanted.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.510
The plan? To stand at street corners outside of churches,

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.510
distributing the track to anyone interested.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.510
Clergy members were not happy with this.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.510
They even tried to have the publishers arrested for distributing free tracks.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.510
Nonetheless, the Bible students courageously did not give up.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:44.510
And just one year, over 900,000 tracks were distributed at street corners all across North America and Europe.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.510
Our public witnessing work was just getting started.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:55.920
In the 1920s, we launched a massive preaching campaign around the publication and public talk series.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.920
Millions now living will never die.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.920
We fought outside the box and tried numerous methods to draw the public's attention.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.129
And it worked.

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:16.050
Over the next several years, we developed even more methods of reaching people.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:27.129
Brothers and sisters even wore their public witnessing in the form of placards, known as sandwich ports, and magazine bags.

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:33.379
There were information marches, imagine being part of one.

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.379
And brother Rutherford, of course, was a shorthand expert.

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:40.379
And whenever you talk to him, he'd always be busy writing.

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.379
He would be making notes, fighting them away.

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.379
So he was doing that this day.

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.379
He ripped it off, and he gave it to me.

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.379
He said, what do you think of it?

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.379
And it said, religions are snare in their racket.

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.379
So I said, that's pretty strong.

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.379
As a matter of fact, I said, that's hot.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.379
Well, he said, that's what I meant it to be.

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.379
But don't you think it's a big idea?

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.379
Now, we're going to have a big information march.

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:11.379
Two days from now, couldn't brother play in the printing, make up some signs, religions are snare in their racket,

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.379
and put them on poles, and we'll have them for the parade.

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.379
So, all right.

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.379
And that's what we did.

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:21.379
And brother Rutherford was also in London at that time.

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:23.379
So he and I led this parade.

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:25.379
This parade was six miles long.

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:27.379
A thousand brothers showed up for the parade.

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:29.379
It really was a spectacle.

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:35.379
And the years that followed, information marches such as these, took place across the world.

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:46.939
In January of 1940, the informant announced the beginning of magazine street work,

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:50.939
with the focus on working the busiest parts of cities.

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:58.939
After that, many became familiar with Jehovah's Witnesses by seeing us offering magazines on streets all over the world.

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:02.939
However, not everyone appreciated our efforts.

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:07.939
In some cases, entire mobs of people would attack our brothers and sisters.

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:13.939
But they courageously pressed forward in the preaching work despite the constant threat of violence.

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:23.290
Their faithful presence and personal interest even led some to change their opinion of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:32.290
You might even know a brother or sister who found the truth by stopping at a literature display at a university, shopping center, or airport.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.290
A major milestone occurred at the dawn of the 21st century,

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:43.290
when the governing body approved our brothers and friends to begin testing different methods of public witnessing,

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:49.290
including the use of literature cards, which looked much different from what we used today.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:55.290
After years of success, the governing body continued to make refinements to public witnessing,

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.290
including the development of special metropolitan public witnessing.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:05.290
These changes put us in contact with people we wouldn't have found when working from house to house.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.730
That brings us to today.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.730
Republic witnessing is a key part of our ministry.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:19.230
Literature cards are so familiar that we've even written a song about them.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:26.230
But whether you're one of thousands in an information march or just one publisher on a street corner, the goal is the same.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:31.230
To demonstrate our love for Jehovah and to reach people's hearts.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.230
See you next time on Our History and Motion.
