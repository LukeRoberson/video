00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.099
Today's text comments remind us that Jehovah is near to his worshipers.

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:12.019
He sees us when we feel overwhelmed or when we feel discouraged.

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:18.219
The fact is that Jehovah can see whatever he wishes to see whenever he desires to do so.

00:00:18.219 --> 00:00:24.699
Now we say he chooses to do this or he can see things whenever he wants to see them

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:30.420
because he's not enslaved to his own power as if he can control it.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.380
The scriptures tell us that sometimes he uses angels to report to him about certain matters.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.140
But however he chooses to do so, Jehovah is aware of what is happening with us and with

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.579
all of his creation.

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.500
Jesus once stated that Jehovah can see what happens to a single sparrow.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.939
How much more than he must notice and care about us, that was Jesus' point.

00:00:55.939 --> 00:01:02.100
Let's look at another example of what Jehovah sees and we'll draw out the principle from it.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.459
It's found in Deuteronomy chapter 22 and verses 6 and 7.

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:14.780
And as we read it, look for what is implied about how much Jehovah sees.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:22.459
At Deuteronomy 22 and verse 6, it starts with telling us this, something the Israelites

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:25.620
were commanded to do.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.900
It says, if you happen upon a bird's nest along the road with young ones or eggs, whether

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.780
in a tree or on the ground, and the mother is sitting on the young ones or the eggs, you

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.819
must not take the mother together with her young.

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:45.459
Be sure to send the mother away, but you may take the young for yourself.

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:53.099
Do this so that it may go well with you and you may live long.

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:57.500
So then what is implied about how much Jehovah sees?

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.620
The implication here is that Jehovah can see what a person does whenever he or she is alone

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.299
or along a roadside, so to speak.

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.140
How is that implied?

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:15.539
We find it in the caution of verse 7, that it may go well with you and you may live long.

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:19.620
To a person with faith, that statement has meaning, doesn't it?

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.180
See what we choose to do matters to Jehovah and the point is that he can see it.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.419
And he doesn't need trail cams to do it.

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:32.699
He can see what we do day by day whenever he chooses.

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:37.180
If he sees we are reasonable and understanding, it pleases him, but he can also see if

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.259
we are unreasonable or uncaring in the things that we do.

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:49.139
When we choose to do his will, it affects our relationship with him in a positive way.

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:55.979
In our future according to that verse, you see the principles and lessons found in verses

00:02:55.979 --> 00:03:01.900
such as these would have taught the Israelites who paid attention to them valuable lessons

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.939
about their heavenly Father and Creator.

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:09.860
King David would have been familiar with those words from Deuteronomy.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.219
Think of those verses as we read what David wrote in Psalm 139 and we are going to read

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:18.340
verses 1 through 4.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:25.580
Now Psalm 139 is a prayer and it begins saying in verse 1,

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.860
O Jehovah, you have searched through me and you know me.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.340
You know when I sit down and when I rise up, you discern my thoughts from afar.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.060
You observe me when I travel or along the road, right?

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.659
And when I lie down, you are familiar with all my ways.

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:53.620
There's not a word on my tongue, but look, O Jehovah, you already know it well.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:00.379
So then whether we are at home or we are traveling far away, Jehovah knows what we do.

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:05.060
Even if a matter is reported to him by an angel, Jehovah can then look to see what has happened

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.500
and with his infinite wisdom and his ability to read hearts, he doesn't need a rewind

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.900
button to do it.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.379
He can do it anytime.

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:19.980
David's words provide a good lesson in caution for all of Jehovah's faithful ones.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.459
Like loyal David, we want Jehovah to see us at any time and be pleased with us, to be

00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:28.660
pleased with the things he sees about us.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.420
We never want him to see us violate his righteous principles and commands.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.139
For example, are we prone to anger when we are out of the sight of others?

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:40.500
Then we must stop.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.459
Are we excessive with food and drink?

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:45.740
Then we must stop.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.699
Do we watch what is ungodly and immoral?

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:50.899
Then we must stop.

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:54.699
Do we neglect personal study and meditation on God's word?

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:57.860
Then we must start.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.899
We please Jehovah when we conform to his righteous standards.

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:08.459
When we're doing our best to serve Jehovah, we feel free to ask him for help, don't we?

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:15.779
That's what David goes on to say in Psalm 139, verse 23, when he requests, search through

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:23.100
me, oh God, and know my heart, examine me and know my anxious thoughts.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:29.420
David wanted Jehovah to see where he had been and to know what he had done.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.819
In fact, David invited Jehovah to see everything, didn't he?

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:36.779
Which of course, Jehovah could do anyway whenever he wanted.

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:41.339
But the invitation from David said a lot about the man.

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:43.899
It said that there was something good in him.

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:47.139
And despite David's serious flaws, he wanted to improve.

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:50.139
He wasn't trying to hide anything.

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:53.139
And Jehovah saw that about him.

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:57.420
How much better it is to have freeness of speech and be able to ask Jehovah to search

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:02.259
through us and to help us rather than to have something that we're trying to hide

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:04.060
from him.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.420
Jehovah knows if we've taken the eggs or young together with the mother bird, so to speak.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.899
That's the point.

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:16.860
So the best advice is to be humble and to deal with the problem, Jehovah's way.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.180
Now like Jehovah, Jesus also sees what is happening with us.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:27.740
Even when he was on earth as a human, Jesus had exceptional, superhuman vision and ability.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.139
Consider the account about Nathaniel, who evidently came to be known as the Apostle

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:34.139
Bartholomew.

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:40.860
We can read about him in John 1 and verses 47-50.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:46.139
Now as we read the verses, look for the things that Jesus saw about or could see about this

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:47.139
man.

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:54.699
Now verse 47 tells us that Jesus saw Nathaniel coming toward him and said about him,

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:59.259
see, truly, an Israelite in whom there is no deceit.

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:03.100
Nathaniel said to him, how do you know me?

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:09.420
Jesus answered him, before Philip called you while you were under the fig tree I saw you.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:16.579
Nathaniel responded, rabbi, you are the Son of God, you are King of Israel.

00:07:16.579 --> 00:07:22.500
Jesus answered him, do you believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree?

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.459
You will see things greater than these.

00:07:26.459 --> 00:07:33.699
Nathaniel was amazed that Jesus knew exactly where he had been, but there was more.

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:37.819
What else did Jesus in effect tell Nathaniel that he could see?

00:07:37.819 --> 00:07:43.740
Well like his Heavenly Father, Jesus could see the heart, and so he said that Nathaniel

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:48.860
was a man in whom there was no deceit.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:54.139
That's how we hope to have Jehovah and his Son view us when they see us under a tree

00:07:54.139 --> 00:07:58.660
so to speak or when they look into our heart, no deceit.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:04.860
If we're striving for that, then Jehovah will be near to us whenever we call to him.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:10.500
And Jesus too will be with us to help us during the difficult times that are yet ahead

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.019
of us, and we must trust in that fact.

00:08:14.019 --> 00:08:20.540
Jesus never failed his Heavenly Father, including when it came to keeping an eye on the welfare

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.259
of his disciples.

00:08:23.339 --> 00:08:30.339
Jesus said something during his well-known prayer recorded for us in John chapter 17 that

00:08:30.339 --> 00:08:36.659
should assure us of his love for us and his close observing of us and care for us.

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:44.220
We read of it in John chapter 17 and in verse 12, John 17, 12.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:49.860
Jesus was just hours from his death, but with great freeness of speech he could say this

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.059
in verse 12.

00:08:52.059 --> 00:08:57.580
When I was with him, I used to watch over them on account of your own name, which you

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:04.539
have given me, and I have protected them, and not one of them is destroyed, except the

00:09:04.539 --> 00:09:10.019
Son of destruction so that the Scripture might be fulfilled.

00:09:10.019 --> 00:09:12.539
I used to watch over them.

00:09:12.539 --> 00:09:17.580
I have protected them, not one of them is destroyed.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:24.899
Jesus could say that because that's the way he lived, it's exactly what he did.

00:09:24.899 --> 00:09:32.100
There was never and there has never been a watchman on earth like Jesus, and we have absolute

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:39.259
confidence that as our Heavenly King, Jesus is always aware and ready to help us.

00:09:39.259 --> 00:09:45.220
So then, we must seek to please Jehovah and his Son at all times, including when we are

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.220
alone.

00:09:46.299 --> 00:09:49.899
We invite them to examine our deepest thoughts and feelings.

00:09:49.899 --> 00:09:54.259
They know that we are not perfect, just like King David was not perfect, but just like

00:09:54.259 --> 00:10:00.100
with David and like with Nathaniel, Jehovah and his Son see our efforts.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:06.220
They also see our deepest desire to worship Jehovah without deceit and to be faithful to

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:07.620
the end.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:08.940
And that's true of us.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:14.940
They will support us and watch over us and reward us come what may.
