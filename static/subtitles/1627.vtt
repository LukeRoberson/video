00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:20.140
In October 2014, an announcement was made at the annual meeting introducing JW Broadcasting.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.300
What a blessing from Jehovah is proved to be.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.100
Many have expressed that they can't wait for the next installment to be posted to enjoy

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.300
the spiritual gems and encouragement.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.859
From around the world, we hear that their friends feel closer to the governing body and

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:37.380
organization than ever before.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.299
But also, the monthly programs have a uniting effect on God's people.

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:46.259
Seeing the faces and hearing the stories of our brothers and sisters around the globe

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:52.259
has given this great crowd reassurance of what a close family we are, all taking part

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:55.859
in the same work wherever we live.

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:59.619
What are your favorite moments from JW Broadcasting?

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:03.979
Perhaps the following compilation from the last two years will help remind you.

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:08.819
You will notice that we've included some behind-the-scenes video clips that have not previously

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:10.500
been published.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.540
You will see that the anchors seem to enjoy producing the programs almost as much as we

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.879
enjoy watching them.

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:20.879
Welcome.

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:21.879
Greetings.

00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:22.879
Welcome.

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:23.879
Welcome.

00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:31.209
We welcome you to JW Broadcasting.

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:37.890
The governing body has approved this station on a trial basis initially in the English language

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.730
only, based on the response from viewers.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.810
In your support of this new arrangement, it is hoped that other languages will enjoy

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.650
the same in the future.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.730
One of the brothers are made to ask me, if I prove from the Bible that something you believe

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.730
is incorrect, what will you do?

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.769
I say, then I will become a witness.

00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:06.650
I always said no.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.409
I said, quick being a stubborn mule, at least read it.

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:16.090
He says, do you know what I was just doing?

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.090
No.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.990
I was on my knees and tears.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.870
I was begging God to send somebody.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.270
After studying with six different elders, I realized that it's not one person that

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.349
changes everybody, but everybody that changes one person.

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.909
And remember that one day years ago, we were trying to understand the Bible without having

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.030
any chance to understand it.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.710
And now we are sitting there, Jova's witnesses.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:55.509
What a privilege we have to know and use the personal name of our loving Father, Jova.

00:02:55.509 --> 00:03:03.909
Jesus tells us that no one can come to the Father unless Jova draws that person.

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:10.590
What he saw, I don't know, but I'm deeply appreciative.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.430
There's nothing here on this earth to compare with God's organization.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.710
There's never been anything even back in Bible times to compare with what Jova has

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.509
now and what he's doing now.

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:30.550
I found people that I was looking for, people without prejudice, without pride, different

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:39.629
nationalities, and that was like taking a deep breath of hope.

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:45.229
I see that Satan's methods have not changed, but it is really encouraging to remember that

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:47.949
Jova also has not changed.

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:55.169
He defended and protected his people in the past, and he will do the same today.

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:59.569
Observe intently the birds of heaven.

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:06.050
They do not so see, or reap, or gather into storehouses, yet your Heavenly Father feeds

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.650
them.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.949
Are you not worth more?

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:16.069
The challenges will come, but they'll also go.

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:18.470
I try not to get stuck on them.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.629
I pray to Jova not to remove this challenges, but to give me the strength to overcome this

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:25.110
challenges.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.430
We also remember that anyone can complain about an imperfect process.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.430
That's easy to do.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.709
All of us can do that.

00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:36.509
But the real gem of a person, the one that can be used the most by Jova is the one who

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:42.230
can take an imperfect process and make it work.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:50.699
Sister Sabina Hernandez has been approved this month as an auxiliary pioneer.

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:52.899
Because it's Sabina can do it.

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:59.870
All the rest of us can too.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.709
Looking back on the experiences and trials that I face serving in prison for neutrality,

00:05:05.709 --> 00:05:12.589
I feel more confident that I can overcome any difficulties that may lie ahead.

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:19.990
I'm looking forward to getting 100% health second, walk the dog, ride the horses, ride

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.589
my bike and run.

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:28.550
Jova is more powerful than my health problem and I know that he can fix it.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:37.509
In fact, it could be that by means of this program, Jova is searching for you.

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:45.750
I personally experienced how merciful Jova was to me and to my wife.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:54.209
When I returned to him, then he returned to me.

00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:58.610
If you're thinking about leaving the truth, don't do it.

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.290
Saint's world will chew you up and spit you out.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:11.569
Get that Bible off its printed page and get it into your heart and then you got it.

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:18.569
Being in the truth at any age is the best life anyone could hope for even in this present

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:22.189
system.

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:31.189
This world would like to make me lonely but I got my friends with me.

00:06:31.189 --> 00:08:03.519
I'm looking forward to getting 100% health second, walk the dog, ride the horses, ride
