00:00:02.859 --> 00:00:12.359
Well, every day in high school, my classmate would talk about sex.

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:16.800
They would just talk about, you know, their boyfriends and girlfriends, what they did with

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.559
them, you know, over the weekend of what they're going to do.

00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:23.920
They of course knew that I was one of Jehovah's Witnesses and that I wouldn't engage in

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.359
premarital sex, but that did not stop them from pushing.

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.559
Guys would invade my personal space.

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:34.920
Sometimes they would even try to, you know, grab or touch me.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.159
One day, a girl in class, she asked me to touch her inappropriately.

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:44.359
Of course, I rejected her, but she even started resorted to calling me names.

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:47.880
She called me Lane, and she said that I must be gay.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.600
It seemed to be a game to them, to try to break me and try to get me to do things with

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.359
them, but the fact that I wouldn't give in, they thought it was fun or funny.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.479
It got to the point where this became very physical.

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.200
I had two classmates behind me that were pushing me.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.439
One classmate on each side of me grabbing my arms and pushing me, trying to make me touch

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:10.439
her.

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.159
And I knew that it was time to get out of there.

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:19.439
Being one of Jehovah's Witnesses, I was already very different in school.

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.640
I was also very shy.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:28.760
So at times I wanted to fit in with the crowds, so I wouldn't have that attention on me.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.680
I knew that this would displease Jehovah if I went with the crowd and did what the other

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.840
kids were doing.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.480
Well, I did say a quick side and pray to Jehovah.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.359
I said, Jehovah, just please help.

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:42.439
I immediately in my mind thought of Joseph.

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.959
He was able to free himself from Potiphar's wife, but he was able to get away because

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:52.079
of his resolve to please Jehovah, and that's exactly what I knew I needed to do, and I did

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.079
just that.

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.719
I ran right out of the classroom.

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:01.799
Mental study was very important, and this made Jehovah really real to me.

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:08.120
The more real he was to me, the more I didn't want to displease him and hurt him.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.759
Having that relationship with him and having that trust in him really helped me get through

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:17.840
those situations of wanting to fit in and go with the crowd.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.800
Rejecting that girl was not easy, but I did know that it was the right thing to do.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.120
Shortly before this incident, my grandmother actually prepared me.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.120
She would prepare watchtower articles for me.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.759
I talked about how to deal with temptation.

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:38.080
Although those talks with her were super duper awkward, if I'm being honest, they really

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.879
helped me to stay spiritually strong and to resist the temptation.

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.960
My parents always told me to use foresighted wisdom.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:53.120
Think about how that action would affect me in the future.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.639
Effect my relationship with Jehovah with my friends and my family.

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.319
That definitely went through my head a lot during that time.

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:07.080
All you need to do is trust in Jehovah because if you trust in him, then everything is

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.280
going to be okay.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.560
The publication that really helped me the most was the Young People Ask Book Volume 2,

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.719
Chapter 5, Why Stay A Version.

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:21.280
This book was really a lifesaver for me.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.120
Reading about how some of my peers all around the world are dealing with the exact same

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.000
temptation really gave me a sense of comfort and helped me to feel that I was not alone.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.800
I'm really grateful to Jehovah and the organization for the love that they show to us young ones

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.800
to help us.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.240
You'll not alone and to help us push through these difficult situations.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:53.479
The Young People Ask Book Volume 2, Chapter 14, How Can I Protect Myself at School?

00:03:53.479 --> 00:04:00.360
It really encouraged me in school to be firm and to stand my ground to make Jehovah happy.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.639
Well, I'm so thankful to Jehovah for recalling his pictures like 1st Corinthians, Chapter

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:10.199
6, Verse 18, which says flee from sexual immorality.

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:14.759
And I'm happy to say that I was able to do just that, but really what makes me the happiest

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:19.000
is knowing that I made Jehovah happy and there is no greater feeling than that.
