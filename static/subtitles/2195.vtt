00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.289
My name is Monica Richardson, I studied genetics and chemistry and then

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:17.170
medicine in Stockholm Sweden. I believed in evolution because of my

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.089
education. Everybody did. It was something I never doubted. It was taught as a

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:28.489
scientific fact and even those who perhaps believed that there was a God

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:33.329
believed that this God would have used evolution in the creation

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:41.170
process. I want to talk about the miracle of birth. Now during pregnancy the

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.850
baby is supplied oxygen via the placenta but at birth it will have to use its

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.090
lungs. In the womb the baby's lungs are collapsed. After breath they have to

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:02.289
become inflated. Now this is a very hard work for the baby to do. So during the

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:07.849
latter part of pregnancy there is a very special chemical produced as

00:01:07.849 --> 00:01:16.370
secreted called a palminary surf actant and that chemical is being deposited on

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.810
the surface of the peripheral parts of the lungs where the gas exchange is

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.049
taking place to lower the surface tension and that means that when the baby is

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:38.489
born and starts to inflate its lungs he can do it. One wonders is this a result of

00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:45.569
a clever intelligent conception and design or could it have happened by chance.

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:51.290
Well it was when the witness is called on me that I really got encouraged to for

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:59.170
the first time in my life look into the Bible. Life around us is so cleverly

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:07.689
designed. I can't believe there is a design without a design.
