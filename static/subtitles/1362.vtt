00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:17.039
More and more people prefer to receive news and information in electronic formats.

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.559
This is one reason why the governing body has used JW.org as another means to provide

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:25.760
spiritual food at the proper time.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.039
By means of this one website, we can communicate with millions of people around the world,

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:37.520
rapidly, economically, and simultaneously in hundreds of languages.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.039
This form of electronic publishing is also more cost-effective.

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:49.600
So how are your brothers and sisters using the website?

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.079
The goal of our ministry is to reach the hearts of people, and the information on JW.org

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.880
is helping us to reach the hearts of ones we meet in the ministry.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.759
I really love the contact cards, they're quick, they're easy, I use them on several occasions,

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:07.239
especially for people who don't have a whole lot of time.

00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:13.000
It's something that you give to them that's tangible, that takes them right to JW.org.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.640
I really enjoy using JW.org in public witnessing.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.000
When people don't have time to talk, I let the videos do the talking for me.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.159
Even if I don't place literature with people, people always notice the card and take notice

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.840
of the website, and I know that if they're going on their plane, they might be looking at

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.439
the website later, so it's a good witness.

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.200
The website enables me to reach people of many languages and nations who are in a hurry.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.359
I especially enjoy the home Bible studies with mothers and little children, and using

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:48.560
the Caleb and Sophia videos, it helps teach the parents how to instill Bible principles

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.799
from a young age in their little ones.

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.799
I showed that stealing is bad video, and a little boy reacted like, wow, we shouldn't

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:57.799
steal.

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.680
So just like that, he got the point.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.120
Reaching the hearts of those who speak another language is really, truly a blessing.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.039
If I can't talk to them, JW.org can.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.960
I use a research guide, a great deal with my Bible studies.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.280
Often, my study will ask me a question that I just don't know quite how to answer, so

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.000
I will just type in the subject right there, answer it in 30 seconds.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.680
I've been able to use JW.org to look up information that maybe my co-workers are going

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.800
through and really try to show them the practical value of the Bible, and so I've been able

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.680
to look up information for lots of loved ones.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.400
Really it's easy, it's accessible, and it's right there in my fingertips, and it's so wonderful

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.199
to be able to have access to it during the day.

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:48.159
What I do is I use the news feature, and I identify my brothers and sisters in other countries

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:53.719
who are in prison, and then I try to pronounce their names in my personal prayers to Jehovah.

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:58.120
Being able to ask the sovereign Lord of the universe to take care of my brothers and

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.639
sisters who are in prison for their faith, it is very comforting and reassuring to know

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:06.199
that they are in the very best of hands.

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:09.879
Sometimes change is difficult, and I know many of our brothers and sisters struggle with

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:14.599
change, struggle with using the electronic tools that Jehovah has given us.

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:19.039
All that takes is a little bit of willingness on our part, and a whole different world

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:24.680
of worship literally opens up in using these new tools that Jehovah has given us.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.120
Technology has made studying and learning so much easier.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.400
You can learn more in the same amount of time, because the scriptures are right at your

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.400
fingertips.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:42.479
The brothers have made that JW Library app so easy to navigate that I had no trouble learning

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:43.479
it.

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:48.240
It was something new to me, of course, but once I started learning and applying it, it

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.240
was fun.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.960
Just like with anything, the more you do it, the easier it becomes.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.520
It's just a wonderful provision that the brothers have made for us.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:02.280
I try to use the resources that are available on JW.org to enhance my teaching during

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.280
family worship.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.800
We practice the new songs, we want to become familiar with them, and be able to sing

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.360
them properly, because it's part of our worship to Jehovah.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.639
We want to praise him.

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:19.519
Using the website has allowed our family to draw closer together, to draw closer to Jehovah,

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:26.290
to draw closer to Jesus, and to the whole organization.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.449
JW.org has helped me dig deeper into God's Word.

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:36.569
Now when we watch and apply what we see, we are motivated to strengthen our relationship

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:37.970
with Jehovah.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.730
It brings a tear to my eye, and I can't help but be deeply touched.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.810
Thank you so much, Jehovah.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.250
It's such a privilege to be instructed by Jehovah in such a direct way.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:58.009
He really knows what we need, giving us such valuable tools for our ministry, for our

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:02.410
personal life, and to help us to draw close to our Heavenly Father.
