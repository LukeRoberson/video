00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.940
I enjoyed associating with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.940
Later I also started to study the Bible.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.939
I knew that I had to make drastic changes in my life,

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:13.939
but my job prevented me from doing so.

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:17.800
So I asked myself,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.800
what would I like to do with my life?

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.690
I began studying the Bible again with a couple,

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.690
and one month later started attending meetings regularly.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.689
Since our parents had stopped studying,

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:37.689
only three of us went to the meetings.

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:40.689
Jehovah could do a lot with you.

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:43.689
Jehovah, you know, your whole perspective can change.

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:50.689
I knew if I applied what I learned, Jehovah would not let me down.

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:52.689
To strengthen my relationship with Jehovah,

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:55.689
I read the Bible daily and I pray.

00:00:55.689 --> 00:01:01.450
My relationship with Jehovah has gotten stronger.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.450
When I pray now, it feels like I'm talking to my close friend.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.450
Going on service more, I think it really helped me

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.450
to draw closer to Jehovah and making the kingdom feel real to me,

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.450
and so that's why I wanted to get baptized.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.450
What a great pleasure it was for me,

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.450
when foremost later, I could dedicate myself to Jehovah

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.450
and get baptized.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.450
That made me so happy.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.450
Today is a very, very special day for me,

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.450
because today I'm getting baptized.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:42.620
At the regional convention, August 9th, 2014,

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.540
it was a beautiful day.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:59.969
Now, when I think about my three children who got baptized today,

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.969
I feel my heart is full of joy,

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.969
and I really thank Jehovah.

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.969
Yeah, it's not a day I don't go thank Jehovah

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:14.050
for taking me out of the darkness.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.050
If we are determined to be loyal to Jehovah,

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.050
and we have the courage to remain chased,

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.050
well, we won't have any regrets.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.050
To know that you have a Heavenly Father,

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.050
that care about you,

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.050
that was the best feeling on earth.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.159
I often think, God, is it true?

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:39.159
Is it real?

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.159
Do I really deserve to have all these blessings?

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:47.159
All these blessings have helped me to see

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:52.159
that this life provides true satisfaction and true happiness.

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:58.159
The important quality that Jehovah has told me is love.

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:01.159
I felt that love from my family, from Jehovah,

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:03.159
from my friends.

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:06.159
I learned that we talk to love people,

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:09.159
and that's what we're supposed to do.

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:11.159
Working closely with Jehovah,

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.159
I really feel part of his family.

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.159
When you give your faith to Jehovah,

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.159
you're giving your life to him.

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.159
He's permitted these things to come upon me.

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:27.789
I knew that, but he protected me.

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:31.789
When I meditate and think about what Jehovah has done for me

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:34.789
and Leile, I don't have to be afraid.

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:36.789
Jehovah is my secure refuge,

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:38.789
because life's may change,

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:43.000
but Jehovah does not change.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Jehovah was the best decision I have made in my life.
