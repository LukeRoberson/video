00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:09.460
Brother Forrest James from the state of Oregon and the United States was raised believing in traditional Native American beliefs.

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:14.699
He later became one of Jehovah's Witnesses, but left the truth immediately thereafter.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.260
What helped him regain his relationship with Jehovah after being an actor for 16 years?

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.940
Our team visited him to find out.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:37.090
I was raised on the telewinding reservation, and I was baptized when I was 12 years old.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:51.780
Although I was baptized at a young age, those that were around me, doing the exact opposite of what I was taught,

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.780
what I heard, what I saw, you know, was not, didn't match up.

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:05.609
There are actions that destroyed my world, destroyed everything, destroyed my family.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.200
And in time, I grew very prejudiced against all the organized religions. Jehovah's Witnesses included.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.840
I was adopted by the film and entertainment industry as a teenager.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.840
I would say to myself with each movie or billboard, that if I could just get this next one, I would be satisfied.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.840
And that's when I became an alcoholic.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.840
Later on, I had a prayer ceremony with a medicine man. He said Jehovah.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.840
I approached him about it afterwards, but indignantly, and said, yeah, we don't believe in the Bible.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.840
It's got nothing to offer.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.840
And he said, well, how do you know? Have you read it?

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:10.650
My brother invited me to a Bible study. And before I went in, I'd said a prayer and risen tears, asking that I not judge these people.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.650
Because at this point, I believed the United Nations would solve mankind's problems.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:23.650
Incidentally, the meeting that night was based on 2 Corinthians 1114, which points out that Satan disguises and himself as an angel of light.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.650
In that one hour, deeply interesting things were over time.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.650
So for the first time in 15 years, I decided to attend a convention.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.650
And it was actually my former tribal chief who became a witness that gave me a ride.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.650
One of my biggest concerns was that I would have to completely give up my culture to serve Jehovah.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.650
There, he helped me to see that I didn't have to.

00:02:53.099 --> 00:03:01.099
After studying with six different elders, I realized that it's not one person that changes everybody, but everybody that changes one person.

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.099
Now, there are so many blessings.

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.099
I'm no longer prejudiced. I have a loving wife.

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.099
I get to teach my kids about Jehovah.

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.099
I enjoy a building of associations.

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:21.259
And I love the full-time ministry.

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:26.259
Especially the opportunity to share with other natives.

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:33.530
When I was so freely given, I wouldn't trade the life that Jehovah has given me for anything.
