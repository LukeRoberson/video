00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:10.830
The theme for this program is, as Jehovah's sheep reject the voice of strangers.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.329
It's estimated that there may be fifteen million animal species on earth today.

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:23.010
But of all these animals, which one is most often used in the Bible to represent good

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.530
people?

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.129
Sheep.

00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:28.850
Jesus often uses illustration.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.370
Here are three examples.

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:35.729
First, to his twelve apostles, he said at Matthew 10-16,

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:40.929
I am sending you out as sheep among wolves.

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:45.090
Second, regarding what he'll do shortly before Armageddon,

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.450
he said at Matthew 25-32 and 33 that

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.210
he will separate people one from another,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.490
just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.170
In subsequent verses, he describes how the sheep

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.729
will inherit everlasting life.

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:08.689
But the goats will depart into everlasting destruction.

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:15.010
Our third example, Jesus said, at John 10-16,

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.930
I have other sheep which are not of this fold.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.290
Those two I must bring in, and they will listen to my voice,

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.010
and they will become one flock, one shepherd.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.849
But a question arises, why did Jesus use a sheep illustration

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:39.090
to represent people who will gain everlasting life?

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.769
Undoubtedly, because of the desirable qualities

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:45.010
literal sheep have.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.890
They're gregarious, having a liking for a companionship.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.329
They don't like to be alone, and it's a good thing

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.010
because without the flock in the protection of the shepherd,

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.730
they're defenseless if a lion or bear approaches.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.290
About all they can do is bleat.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.290
Baw!

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.000
Goodbye, little sheep.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.800
Another good quality is that sheep as a whole tend to be peaceful,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.039
inoffensive, very different from goats.

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:21.759
As little boys, my brother and I would pet the goats

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:23.919
that my grandfather had.

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:29.280
But if we turn our backs on them, one would often sneak up behind us

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.280
and but us for no reason.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.159
These are some of the desirable characteristics

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:41.280
that make sheep an appropriate illustration for good people.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.960
But the quality we especially want to focus on

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:51.120
is identified at John 10-4-5.

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:56.080
When he, that is the shepherd, has brought all his own out,

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.319
he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.800
because they know his voice.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.400
They will, by no means, follow a stranger

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.280
but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.919
of strangers.

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:17.199
So what's the desirable quality?

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.159
Sheep listened to the voice of their shepherd

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.599
and reject the voice of strangers.

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.000
Regarding this quality of sheep,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.719
the September 1st 2004 watchtower said this.

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:35.199
A book on Bible lands relates that a visitor once claimed

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:38.400
that sheep recognized their shepherd by his dress,

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.280
not his voice, a shepherd answered that it was the voice they knew.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.120
To prove this, he exchanged clothing with a stranger.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.280
Dressed in the shepherd's garb,

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.919
the stranger called the sheep,

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:54.639
but they did not respond.

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.879
They did not know his voice.

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.280
Yet when the shepherd called them,

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.879
though he was disguised, the sheep came at once.

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.120
Please ask yourself,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.759
as one of Jehovah's figurative sheep,

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.000
do I obediently respond to the voice of the fine shepherd

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.120
and flee from the voice of strangers?

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.120
Well, let's talk about this.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.360
The original stranger was Satan the Devil.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.920
Like a ventriloquist, he made a serpent appear to top,

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.879
but the words were Satan's words.

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:35.839
Satan thereby used his voice to slander Jehovah

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:38.879
and deceive Eve.

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:43.439
Today, Satan continues his work as an evil ventriloquist

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:45.360
using not serpents,

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.920
but human puppets to enunciate his voice

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.240
these acting as his agents,

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.639
either wittingly or unwittingly.

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.160
But now, let's discuss three examples

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.600
of how our fine shepherd tells us one thing,

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.720
but Satan's underlings or strangers

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.759
tell us something opposite.

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:15.920
We must be vigilant to listen to the right voice.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.480
Our fine shepherd tells us as our first example,

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.040
these words at Matthew chapter 24,

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.560
verses 45 through 47,

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.720
who really is the faithful and discreet slave

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.319
whom is master appointed over his domestics

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:39.040
to give them their food at the proper time.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.600
Happy is that slave if his master on a coming

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.759
finds him doing so?

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:49.120
Truly, I say to you, he will appoint him

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.079
over all his belongings.

00:05:52.079 --> 00:05:55.600
We know the master Jesus found the faithful

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.480
and discreet slave spiritually feeding

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.920
right-hearted ones in 1919,

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.680
and at a future time will appoint him

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.480
over all his belongings.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.879
So what's the implication?

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:12.800
Obviously, even now,

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.439
Jesus fully trusts the faithful slave,

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:19.040
and all of us,

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.240
even individual members of the governing body,

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.879
should do the same.

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:29.199
But what does the voice of strangers say on this subject?

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:32.000
Don't trust the faithful slave.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.399
He will mislead you.

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:37.040
And who often have the loudest voice

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.000
promoting this false message?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.240
Upostates.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.560
Hebrews 139 labels false messages

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.040
as strange teachings.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.800
Yes, they are the teachings of strangers.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.160
Some examples of their strange teachings

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.800
are that the faithful slave protects pedophiles,

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.079
or that slave will exploit you

00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:07.600
so they can live lives of luxury.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:14.000
Those are both bald-faced lies.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.480
Acts 2030 says that apostates speak

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.439
twisted things. They do this

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:24.319
in order to draw God's sheep away

00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:27.519
and make them followers of themselves.

00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:29.600
Something that's twisted

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.360
is been out of shape or distorted.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.439
They speak twisted things

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:38.079
by leaving out vital details,

00:07:38.079 --> 00:07:40.399
taking things out of context,

00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:41.920
or in some other way

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.920
manipulating a truth

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.600
into a lie

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:50.240
or into a misleading half-truth.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.959
Second Peter 2.3 says,

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.319
They will greedily exploit you

00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:59.040
with counterfeit words.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.560
A counterfeit is something that's carefully designed

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.319
to look like the real thing.

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:06.959
Take, for example, counterfeit money.

00:08:06.959 --> 00:08:08.959
It might look genuine,

00:08:08.959 --> 00:08:12.000
but it's fake and thus worthless.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.040
If we're deceived into accepting it,

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.879
we'll lose money.

00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:19.040
But if we're deceived into accepting

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.839
the counterfeit words of apostate,

00:08:21.839 --> 00:08:25.920
we'll lose our life.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.600
And apostates will give us

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.839
absolutely nothing of value in exchange.

00:08:31.839 --> 00:08:33.600
Can you imagine

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.759
really needing a loving,

00:08:35.759 --> 00:08:37.519
shepherding visit

00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:42.370
and asking apostates to give you one?

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:44.769
Similarly, we must be careful

00:08:44.769 --> 00:08:46.769
about believing everything presented

00:08:46.769 --> 00:08:47.970
in the media

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:50.769
about Jehovah's organization.

00:08:50.769 --> 00:08:52.929
Remember, the media is commonly

00:08:52.929 --> 00:08:55.649
motivated by prejudice, hatred,

00:08:55.649 --> 00:08:58.129
and a desire for profit.

00:08:58.129 --> 00:09:01.570
False and exaggerated news reports

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:04.610
are very common.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:07.090
For example, in one European country,

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:09.169
many people were indignant

00:09:09.169 --> 00:09:11.090
when an emotional press report

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:13.090
stated that a young female witness

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:16.049
died because she refused

00:09:16.049 --> 00:09:18.690
a blood transfusion.

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:21.169
Were those the complete facts?

00:09:21.169 --> 00:09:22.850
No.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.409
The patient refused a blood transfusion

00:09:25.409 --> 00:09:27.169
on religious grounds,

00:09:27.169 --> 00:09:28.769
but she did agree

00:09:28.769 --> 00:09:33.169
to alternative non-blood medical management.

00:09:33.169 --> 00:09:36.210
This could have been implemented immediately

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:39.090
and likely would have saved her life.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:42.690
However, the hospital delayed matters

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.850
unnecessarily

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.009
until it was too late.

00:09:47.009 --> 00:09:52.590
The press report didn't mention these facts,

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:54.269
while it's unreasonable

00:09:54.269 --> 00:09:58.590
to distrust all secular sources of information,

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:01.070
we must be wary.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.870
First John 5.19 says,

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:07.149
the whole world is lying

00:10:07.149 --> 00:10:12.159
in the power of the wicked one.

00:10:12.159 --> 00:10:14.639
Now, let's discuss a second example

00:10:14.639 --> 00:10:17.679
of the voice of our fine shepherd, Jesus.

00:10:17.679 --> 00:10:20.960
Matthew chapter 5

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.759
verses 27 and 28.

00:10:23.759 --> 00:10:25.600
Jesus said,

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.600
You heard that it was said,

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.039
you must not commit adultery.

00:10:31.039 --> 00:10:32.480
But I say to you

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.759
that everyone who keeps on looking at a woman

00:10:35.759 --> 00:10:38.080
so as to have a passion for her

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:43.120
has already committed adultery with her in his heart.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.080
Our fine shepherd is telling us

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.200
not only to avoid sexual immorality,

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.440
but also to flee from anything

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.200
that could lead to it,

00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:55.759
such as immoral thoughts.

00:10:55.759 --> 00:10:58.799
And at Matthew 19.9,

00:10:58.799 --> 00:11:01.120
our fine shepherd tells us,

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.960
I say to you

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.759
that whoever divorces his wife

00:11:05.759 --> 00:11:08.879
except on the grounds of sexual immorality

00:11:08.879 --> 00:11:10.799
and marries another

00:11:10.799 --> 00:11:13.200
commits adultery.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.279
Here Jesus makes clear

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:18.879
that the only valid basis for divorce and remarriage

00:11:18.879 --> 00:11:20.720
in God's eyes

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.440
is if a disloyal mate

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.559
commits sexual immorality.

00:11:26.559 --> 00:11:28.399
But what's the voice of strangers

00:11:28.399 --> 00:11:30.399
of Satan's world telling us

00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:33.120
regarding divorce, adultery,

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:37.039
and other forms of sexual immorality?

00:11:37.039 --> 00:11:38.799
No problem.

00:11:38.799 --> 00:11:40.879
It's your choice.

00:11:40.879 --> 00:11:42.879
You have the freedom

00:11:42.879 --> 00:11:45.519
to do what you want.

00:11:45.519 --> 00:11:48.399
In fact, in order to make sexual immorality

00:11:48.399 --> 00:11:50.639
appear more innocent,

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.279
it's often euphemized.

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:56.960
Sexual perversion, such as homosexuality,

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:02.000
is called an alternative lifestyle.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.559
One so-called expert said,

00:12:04.559 --> 00:12:07.840
it's simply like being left-handed.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.879
Pornography is called adult entertainment.

00:12:12.879 --> 00:12:16.799
Adultress betrayal of one's marriage mate

00:12:16.799 --> 00:12:21.360
is called having an affair.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.480
Many call getting married old-fashioned

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.919
and see nothing wrong

00:12:25.919 --> 00:12:27.360
with living together

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.679
without marriage.

00:12:29.679 --> 00:12:31.440
And this world's media

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.799
is very skillful

00:12:32.799 --> 00:12:35.519
at presenting something bad

00:12:35.519 --> 00:12:37.360
as good.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.879
For example, in a movie

00:12:38.879 --> 00:12:41.440
a female character might be portrayed

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.879
as having a husband who is abusive.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.240
You like the woman

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.120
and you want her to find happiness.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:53.200
Then a handsome man starts working in her office

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.840
and he's so nice to her.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.559
There's an attraction between them,

00:12:58.559 --> 00:13:00.399
and the budding romance

00:13:00.399 --> 00:13:01.919
is presented

00:13:01.919 --> 00:13:04.080
as something good.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.639
Soft background music makes it hard

00:13:06.639 --> 00:13:10.960
to consider her course to be bad.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.039
It's easy to keep watching

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:16.240
and hope she leaves her marriage mate

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.039
and runs off with a workmate.

00:13:19.039 --> 00:13:22.159
And usually that's what happens.

00:13:22.159 --> 00:13:25.200
So easily we can forget

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.759
that Jehovah and Jesus hate adultery

00:13:27.759 --> 00:13:30.799
and unscriptual divorce.

00:13:30.799 --> 00:13:33.440
But when we reject the voice

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.360
of this world

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:39.440
and listen to the voice of Jehovah and Jesus,

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.639
we bring protection and blessings

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.399
to ourselves and others.

00:13:46.399 --> 00:13:48.879
But now our third example

00:13:48.879 --> 00:13:51.360
of the voice of our fine shepherd

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.240
is at Matthew 6

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.639
and we're going to read verses 19

00:13:56.639 --> 00:13:59.039
and 20.

00:13:59.039 --> 00:14:02.159
Stop storing up for yourselves treasures

00:14:02.159 --> 00:14:03.519
on the earth

00:14:03.519 --> 00:14:06.320
where moth and rust consume

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.519
and where thieves break in and steal.

00:14:09.519 --> 00:14:12.720
Rather, store up for yourselves treasures

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.360
in heaven where neither moth

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.360
nor rust consumes

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.320
and where thieves do not break in

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.840
and steal.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.039
We're told

00:14:23.039 --> 00:14:26.720
that our focus should be on spiritual things

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.120
and not on physical things.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.360
And this is especially true

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.200
when thinking about where we are

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.200
in the stream of time.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.960
In the final part

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.799
of the final part

00:14:38.799 --> 00:14:41.200
of the last days.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.519
But what's the voice of strangers

00:14:43.519 --> 00:14:47.120
of this world on this subject?

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.240
Exert yourself vigorously

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:54.000
to acquire material possessions.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.279
Pursue things

00:14:55.279 --> 00:14:58.159
that will make your life comfortable

00:14:58.159 --> 00:14:59.679
because that

00:14:59.679 --> 00:15:03.360
is what will bring you happiness.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.960
The question is,

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.759
to whom are we listening?

00:15:07.759 --> 00:15:09.679
Jehovah and Jesus tell us

00:15:09.679 --> 00:15:11.440
to be content now

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.080
with a spiritual paradise

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.200
and to concentrate

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.519
on our lifesaving preaching work

00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:19.120
and that they will provide

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.200
a physical paradise

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.200
later.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.759
First Peter 211 indicates

00:15:25.759 --> 00:15:28.080
that we should view ourselves

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.879
as temporary residents

00:15:30.879 --> 00:15:33.360
who are just passing through this old system

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.519
and headed for the real life

00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:37.919
in the new world.

00:15:37.919 --> 00:15:41.840
What do we mean by temporary resident?

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.200
We'll imagine that you rent an old house to live in

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.320
while a new,

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.440
beautiful house is being built for you.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.399
You'll live there only a few months.

00:15:52.399 --> 00:15:55.919
Would you install a new concrete driveway?

00:15:55.919 --> 00:15:58.159
Would you put in new electrical wiring

00:15:58.159 --> 00:16:00.080
and plumbing?

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.840
Would you install brand new vinyl siding?

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.440
No.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.440
You might do a few cosmetic things

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.240
to make your stay a little more comfortable

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.879
but you wouldn't do anything major.

00:16:12.879 --> 00:16:14.000
Why?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.360
Because you know

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.440
you're just a temporary resident

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.039
and that soon

00:16:19.039 --> 00:16:20.240
you'll move

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.440
into your beautiful new home.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.519
Well, if we think of ourselves

00:16:25.519 --> 00:16:27.279
just as temporary residents

00:16:27.279 --> 00:16:29.279
in this old system,

00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:31.600
it'll be a real protection

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.000
against the materialism

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.919
that is promoted

00:16:35.919 --> 00:16:39.519
by the voice of strangers.

00:16:39.519 --> 00:16:42.480
We've now discussed three examples

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.960
of Jesus' voice.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.399
Number one,

00:16:46.399 --> 00:16:50.320
trust the faithful and discreet slave.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.840
Two, reject sexual immorality

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.399
and unscriptural divorce.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:01.120
Three, focus on storing up spiritual treasures

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.640
rather than material treasures.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.640
Of course, there are many other examples

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.119
of these two different voices

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:11.920
but may we all be vigilant

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:16.000
to listen to the right voice.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.160
Of Jesus, Jehovah Himself said,

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.880
this is my Son, the beloved,

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.359
whom I have approved.

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:28.480
Listen to Him.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.200
But in order to do so obediently

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.279
as Jehovah's sheep,

00:17:33.279 --> 00:17:35.119
we must reject

00:17:35.119 --> 00:17:38.720
the voice of strangers.
