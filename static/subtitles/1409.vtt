00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:36.939
What's your biggest question about life?

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:39.939
Why are people so obsessed with kicking round objects?

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:47.219
Well, there's that, but seriously, anything?

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.539
Why do people hate?

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:55.539
If we all go to children, what's the deal?

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:59.539
Good question, and one of the Bible definitely answers.

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:05.540
But you've a train to catch, so we'll stop there.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.540
But is Tuesday still good?

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:14.849
Assuming spacetime hasn't collapsed into a singularity, I'm open.

00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:21.590
Okay. Cool.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.590
On Tuesday, we'll carry on with...

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:48.189
So, how's the study going?

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.189
Brilliant. Was it for the easy stuff?

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:57.099
Oh, what I loved about this prophecy

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:00.099
is that it was written like 200 years before actually happened

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:03.099
and every single detail came true.

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:07.099
The men in charge just left the gates open.

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:12.270
I mean, I would have fired anyone that got drunk

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.270
and left to see gates open.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.599
Anyway, back to the prophecy book.

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.599
So God is love, but he's going to kill billions. How's that work?

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.599
Well, it'll make sense later.

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.599
But for now, let's just focus on what I was talking about earlier.

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.599
What's so nice about this chapter is that it's talking about prayer.

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.599
Well, it's talking about how Jehovah helps us with prayer.

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.599
And so it's really lovely because we can pray to someone

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.599
who's basically all of this is evidence of the last days.

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:50.289
So what would you say of the signs of the last days?

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:55.009
Wars.

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:58.009
Disasters.

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:01.009
Red people.

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:03.009
Yeah?

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:06.009
Anything else?

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:08.009
No.

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:10.009
Okay.

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:12.009
That's fine. We can just...

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:14.009
We'll just review it in the next lesson.

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:22.780
That's fine. Do you want to just wrap it up now then?

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.250
Is everything okay?

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.069
This will. I'm going to go.

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:42.930
All right. Bye, Gladys.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.930
She just said one word. I just...

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.039
I said one word to do.

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:53.039
Well, thankfully, I've never had a student like that.

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:56.039
Okay. She's really getting a hang of the ceremony.

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:59.120
She is.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.120
But seriously, I...

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.120
I really put myself into the study to try and make it live.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.120
And I get...

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.120
Yes. No.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.120
Maybe.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.259
Or another insufferable off-topic question.

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:19.259
Maybe let's do a bit of research.

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.740
You'd say that.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:23.740
I'll put the kettle on.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.740
Thanks.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.740
Here we go.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.740
October 2020 Watchtower.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:36.279
This box.

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:44.959
Exercise self-control by not talking too much.

00:04:44.959 --> 00:04:46.959
I guess I do need help.

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:47.959
But look.

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:51.959
Let the students see that you're excited about Bible truths.

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:52.959
But on that.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:57.459
Make friends in the congregation.

00:04:57.459 --> 00:05:03.379
I could or maybe we could do this.

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:08.379
Look for signs that reveal her desire to serve Jehovah.

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:11.379
Who's free on Friday?

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:13.379
Sorry, Jalen, busy.

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:17.139
Oh, yeah. I'd love to.

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:43.139
Okay.

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:45.139
So, a surprise today.

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:48.139
My usual lecture has been cancelled in favour of a discussion.

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:49.139
And?

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:54.100
Jalen, I'm not really the drum roll type.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.100
Oh.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.100
Hi. I'm Nita.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.100
One of Jade's remakes.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.100
And your...

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.379
Gladys.

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:04.379
So.

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:07.379
Let's start with the question you hit me with last time.

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:11.379
Which is, why do we stay neutral when we see injustice?

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:16.009
Take it, you've had your fair share?

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:18.009
Me too.

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:22.009
Although not as bad as my mum and dad for what they tell me.

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:26.009
But how are things ever changed if we don't do something about it?

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:28.009
Let's see what the Bible has to say.

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:33.009
In Jeremiah chapter 10, I'm verse 23.

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:36.009
Could you read that?

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:40.009
I will know, Jehovah, that man's way does not belong to him.

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:46.009
It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his death.

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:52.009
But if that's true, then the future of the human race is looking quite bleak.

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:54.009
Does that mean then?
