00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.299
the text for the day, Daniel 1127,

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:12.300
the two kings will sit at one table speaking lies to each other.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.300
And as long as there's been human kings,

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.300
while lies have been told to the populists,

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.300
the Greek philosopher Plato said this,

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.300
the rulers of the state may be allowed to lie for the good of the state.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.300
And over the centuries, kings and rulers and diplomats

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:38.299
have perfected their skills in diplomacy and deception.

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:43.299
Now the scriptures give us an example of a bold face lie by a diplomat.

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:49.299
And if we turn to Isaiah 36 and verses 16 and 17,

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:52.299
the one speaking here is the Rapshika.

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:57.299
He was the cut bear of King Sinac, Sinac grip.

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:01.299
And here's what he says, 16 speaking to God's people,

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:03.299
do not listen to Hezekiah,

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:06.299
for this is what the king of Assyria says.

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.299
Make peace with me and surrender,

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.299
and each of you will lead from his own vine and from his own fig tree

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:16.299
and will drink the water of his own sister.

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.299
Until I come and take you to a land like your own land,

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:29.299
a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.299
He was promising peace and security, wasn't he?

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.299
But you see, what they had to do first was surrender to the king

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.299
in order to get this peace and security this being promised.

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.299
But the thing is, Jehovah had promised peace and security

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.299
to his people long before this.

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.299
Effectively, what the Assyrian was doing was offering peace

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.299
and security apart from Jehovah God.

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.299
Obviously, you know the way the Assyrians handled their captives.

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:08.300
They were vicious and truly this was an empty promise coming

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.300
from the table of liars.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:22.300
It's a note that liars will often shroud our cover their lie in truths.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.300
And a brief math fact can illustrate that we've talked about this recently.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.300
You recall that anything multiplied by zero ends up in zero, right?

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.300
No matter how many numbers are multiplied,

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.300
if there's a zero that's multiplied in that equation,

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.300
it's going to end up in zero.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.300
The answer is always a zero.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.300
The tactic that Satan uses is to insert something valueless

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.300
or false in otherwise true statements.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.300
See, Satan is the zero.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.300
He's a giant zero.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:09.300
Anything that he is combined with will be valueless, will be a zero.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.300
So look for the zero in any equation of statements

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.300
that cancels out all the other truths.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.300
A note how this was the case with the Israelites.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.300
We'll go back to that account in Isaiah 36.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.300
This time we'll read verses 18 and 19.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.300
He said, Do not let Hezekiah mislead you by saying,

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.300
Jehovah will rescue us.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:38.300
Have any of the gods of the nations rescued their land out of the hand of King Assyria?

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.300
Where are the gods of Hema and Arpad?

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.300
And where are the gods of Sepharveim?

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.300
And have they rescued Samaria out of my hand?

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.300
Did you note the lie was nestled in some truths?

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.300
See, look in verse 18.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.300
It was true, the gods of other nations had failed to save their people.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.300
In verse 19 is true, Hema, then Arpad had been conquered.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.300
But the Israelites were not tricked by this.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:19.300
Because these statements, they understood earlier Isaiah in Isaiah 10 verse 9

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:26.300
had prophesied that the Assyrian king would boast about these very cities.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:35.300
History confirms that Carcomish, Arpad and Damascus all had been conquered after Isaiah made these prophecies

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:41.300
and before the Rapshaka presented these in his promise.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:51.300
In this case, Jehovah help the faithful ones to see the lie that was inserted in otherwise true statements.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.300
Now let's go back to our scripture in Daniel chapter 11.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:04.300
It is a fascinating chapter verses 27 and 28 is describing the time leading up to World War I.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:11.300
And there it says that the king of the north and the king of the south will sit at a table speaking lies.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.300
And that's exactly what happened.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:24.300
In the late 1800s, Germany, the king of the north and Britain, the king of the south, told each other that they wanted peace.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:31.300
They lied to each other and they lied to the people that were following them.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:40.300
One German general boasted, in two weeks, we shall defeat France.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.300
What really happened?

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:54.300
Well, the lies of both of these kings resulted in massive destruction and millions of death in World War I and World War II later.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:02.300
But the nations today are doing the very same thing. They're lying to one another and they're lying to their citizens.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:15.300
And in the near future, the world populace will be told a big lie from the table of the lies just like the Rapshaka did that we read earlier.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.300
What is the lie and how can we protect ourselves?

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:28.420
Well, we go to the first Thessalonians, the Apostle Paul talked about it, chapter 5 and verse 3.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:36.420
Whenever it is that they are saying peace and security, then sudden destruction is to be instantly upon them.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:46.420
Now, the new English Bible renders this verse, while they are talking of peace and security, all at once calamity is upon them.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:59.420
So when the attention of the humans is on the big lie, the hope for peace and security destruction is going to strike them when they lease expected.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.420
Now, how can we protect ourselves as the question?

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.420
Go down to verse 8.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:15.420
The Apostle Paul says, but as for us who belong to the day, let us keep our senses and put our breastplate of faith and love and hope of salvation as a helmet.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:21.420
So two things he recommends, the breastplate of faith and love, it relates to our figurative heart.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:32.420
See, combining faith and God's promises, understanding the promises and having a deep love for him is going to protect our spiritual heart.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:37.420
It is going to be a spiritual breastplate. It will be of the highest quality.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:43.420
And then the hope of salvation as our helmet, it is going to protect our mind.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:52.420
So we are not swayed one way or another by the old system and the lies of the system will stay spiritually awake.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:08:02.420
Now, in our day, there is another group of men that are sitting at one table, our governing body.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:10.420
They never lie or deceive us. We can have absolute trust in the governing body.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:16.420
They meet all the criteria that Jesus gave us to identify them by.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:26.420
We know exactly who Jesus is using to protect his people from the lies. We just must stay alert.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:37.419
Done review, how can we identify a lie? Look for the zero. Any component in a statement or teaching that cancels out a Bible truth.

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:43.419
How can we avoid being caught up in the cry of peace and security?

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:54.419
What Jehovah has already promised peace and security and has clearly forewarned us that a false cry will soon be coming.

00:08:54.419 --> 00:09:02.419
And what table can we trust? The table surrounded by our future kings, the governing body.
