00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:07.570
In the revelation presented to the Apostle John, Jesus pointed ahead many centuries to

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.570
the time when Jehovah brings an end to those who oppose His kingdom.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.890
At Revelation 11 and verse 18, it speaks of such opposers as those ruining the earth.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:27.329
In its entirety, the verse says this, Revelation 11 verse 18.

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:33.090
But the nations became wrathful, and your own wrath came, and the appointed time came

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.649
for the dead to be judged, and to reward your slaves, the prophets, and the holy ones,

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:46.530
and those fearing your name, the small and the great, and to bring to ruin those ruining

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.210
the earth.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:56.649
This verse assures us that Jehovah is going to stop the ruining of the earth.

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:02.289
But is it only man's pollution of the earth, and the misuse of its resources that is being

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:07.129
spoken of here, or is there more to it?

00:01:07.129 --> 00:01:13.370
To answer those questions, here are four main points that we will consider.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.930
What is the earth as spoken of in God's Word?

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:25.489
To what ruining of it does Revelation 11 and 18 refer, when will Jehovah act to stop it?

00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:30.209
And what is the earth that will endure forever?

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:34.129
So to start, what is meant by earth?

00:01:34.129 --> 00:01:38.890
To answer that question, we'll look at the planet and the people.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.530
Why do we include the people?

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:48.489
Because earth, like some other expressions in God's Word, has more than one basic meaning.

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:50.689
Consider the word heaven.

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:56.250
Heaven has the sense of that which is higher lofty, and it can refer to a number of things.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:03.489
For example, at Genesis 27, verse 28, we read of Isaac's blessing for Jacob.

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:05.730
He told him in part,

00:02:05.769 --> 00:02:10.129
May the true God give you the do's of the heavens.

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.009
The do's of the heavens.

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:16.770
Here, heavens has the meaning of literal sky, true.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.050
But now compare Daniel chapter 4 and verse 26.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.090
In this verse, we read that Daniel interprets Nebuchadnezzar's dream regarding the great tree,

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.009
and he says to him,

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:37.090
Your kingdom will be yours again after you come to know that the heavens are ruling.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.330
Clearly, this is not the literal sky, is it?

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.689
But it has reference to Jehovah's sovereignty.

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:51.250
Likewise, in the Bible, the word earth can have more than one meaning.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.810
First, let's look at the planet.

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:59.650
Unlike the planets that have been named after false gods,

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.090
Genesis chapter 1 tells us that Jehovah named this planet earth.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.689
As for the false labeling of the other planets, we can be certain that those disgusting names will soon be gone.

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:16.729
But as for the earth, Jehovah leaves us in no doubt about its future.

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:20.689
It was created to last forever.

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:24.090
Ecclesiastes chapter 1 and verse 4 states,

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.810
that although generations of people at this time come and go,

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.210
the earth it says that is the planet remains forever.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:41.490
Psalm 104 verse 5 adds that it will not be moved from its place forever and ever.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.610
So then the planet earth will never be destroyed.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.930
God's purpose for it will be fulfilled.

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:51.050
What is that purpose?

00:03:51.050 --> 00:04:02.449
God's purpose is for the earth to be inhabited by faithful humans in perfection and happiness with everlasting life.

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:07.050
That brings us to the people, those for whom the earth was made.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.610
You can hardly mention one without the other, right?

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.129
For instance, many scriptures refer to people when speaking of the earth.

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:17.970
Here are some examples.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.089
Genesis 111.

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:24.769
Now all the earth continued to be of one language.

00:04:24.769 --> 00:04:34.610
At Genesis 24 and verse 3, Abraham refers to Jehovah as being the God of the earth, obviously people.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.689
Isaiah 49 13,

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:41.889
Shalt for joy, you heavens, and rejoice, you earth.

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:51.610
And Revelation 192 speaks of false religion as the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:58.730
Clearly, those verses refer to humans who can speak, who can worship, who can express joy,

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:03.850
and who can be corrupted by sexual immorality.

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:08.449
Up to this point, we've looked at the earth then as a planet.

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:16.970
We have reviewed God's purpose for it, and we have considered how the word earth relates to the people on it.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:28.730
Now let's consider the question to what ruining does Revelation 1118 refer to the planet, the people, or both?

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.569
First, the planet.

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:37.730
Jehovah hates to see the earth being ruined today as it is, and we can be certain that he hates the pollution,

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:46.569
the damage to the earth's climate, the misuse of its resources, and the devastation of human wars.

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:49.250
Jehovah cares for what he has made.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.129
After making the earth, he said that it was good.

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:56.649
We can read about it at Genesis 1 and 2.

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:59.170
Imagine Jehovah's happiness.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.170
This special planet was to be a gift.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:10.490
Psalm 115 and verse 16 states that the earth he has given to the sons of men.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.689
So then, what about the people?

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:20.689
Does Jehovah's discuss that the ruining of the earth apply to the ruining of mankind as well?

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:22.290
Yes.

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:28.569
We can see this in what is stated at Genesis 6 and verses 11 and 12.

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:35.009
In this setting, the world of Noah's Day has become ruined in God's eyes.

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:42.089
And as we read the verses, look for the connection between the earth and mankind.

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:47.610
It says, Genesis 6 starting in verse 11,

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:51.410
But the earth had become ruined in the sight of the true God,

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.329
and the earth was filled with violence.

00:06:54.329 --> 00:06:57.889
Yes, God looked upon the earth and it was ruined.

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:03.810
All flesh had ruined its way on the earth.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.209
Do you see the connection?

00:07:06.209 --> 00:07:11.970
Rather than speaking of just the planet, the scriptures here linked the ruining of all flesh

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:16.689
or people with the ruining of the earth.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:21.449
Likewise, today, just as mankind is harming the actual planet,

00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:27.370
the world under Satan's control is also ruining all flesh.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.769
In both ways, the earth is being ruined.

00:07:30.769 --> 00:07:32.529
How so?

00:07:32.529 --> 00:07:38.490
Along with false religion, human society in general is gradually corrupting everything

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:42.410
that Jehovah has said in place for mankind.

00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:46.930
We see it in their incessant, nationalistic wars.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:51.050
We see it in their racial hatred and divisiveness.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:54.689
We see it in their promoting of abortion.

00:07:54.689 --> 00:07:58.089
We see it in their so-called gay marriage.

00:07:58.089 --> 00:08:02.730
We see it in the gender blurring that the world is promoting.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.730
You don't have to be a man or a woman, they say.

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:09.129
You can be whatever you feel like or choose to be.

00:08:09.129 --> 00:08:10.850
Really?

00:08:10.889 --> 00:08:13.689
What does Jehovah say about that?

00:08:13.689 --> 00:08:20.290
At Deuteronomy 22 and verse 5, he told the nation of Israel that, quote,

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:23.889
a woman must not put on the clothing of a man.

00:08:23.889 --> 00:08:26.730
Nor should a man wear the clothing of a woman.

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:33.009
For anyone doing so is detestable to Jehovah your God.

00:08:33.009 --> 00:08:37.730
If that is how the creator feels about the switching of clothing,

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:41.649
how much more detestable he must view the world's attempts

00:08:41.649 --> 00:08:46.330
to blur the lines of gender with false labeling.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:51.809
Recently, the World Health Organization adjusted its view of gender.

00:08:51.809 --> 00:08:54.129
It now states that, quote,

00:08:54.129 --> 00:09:00.049
there are many genders existing on a spectrum from male to female.

00:09:00.049 --> 00:09:05.409
It added that gender identity exists on a continuum

00:09:05.409 --> 00:09:09.649
and that sex is not limited to male or female.

00:09:09.649 --> 00:09:12.450
Again, really?

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:16.929
Talk about an attempt to tear apart what Jehovah has made.

00:09:16.929 --> 00:09:22.450
So then, even government agencies on a global scale are getting involved.

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:28.289
And they are critical of anyone who does not adopt their warped view.

00:09:28.289 --> 00:09:32.210
At Proverbs 19, verse 3, it explains,

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:36.450
it is a man's own foolishness that distorts his way

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:41.330
and his heart becomes enraged against Jehovah.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.330
And going back to marriage,

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:47.210
Jehovah instituted the arrangement to be a permanent bond

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.970
between a man and a woman.

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:53.210
At Matthew 19 verses 4 and 5,

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:57.610
we read how Jesus emphasized this while he was on the earth.

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:01.529
Quoting from Genesis 2.24, he said this,

00:10:01.529 --> 00:10:05.769
have you not read that the one who created them from the beginning

00:10:05.769 --> 00:10:09.450
made them male and female and said,

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:13.049
for this reason a man will leave his father and his mother

00:10:13.049 --> 00:10:19.450
and will stick to his wife and the two will be one flesh?

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:27.129
He made them male and female and the two will be one flesh.

00:10:27.129 --> 00:10:30.250
Jehovah's purpose for humans is clear,

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:36.169
but Satan's world now says that marriage can be between two men or two women.

00:10:36.169 --> 00:10:38.769
Again, really?

00:10:38.769 --> 00:10:43.289
We can be certain that promoting this corrupt view is Satan's attempts,

00:10:43.289 --> 00:10:46.450
part of Satan's attempt to ruin mankind,

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:50.129
to make them so abhorrent to Jehovah

00:10:50.129 --> 00:10:56.049
that he would abandon humans and his purpose for mankind in the earth.

00:10:56.049 --> 00:10:58.450
But that will never happen.

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:04.970
God's purpose for mankind and their home will be fulfilled.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.730
Just like the disgusting names of the false gods

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.690
that humans have given to the literal planets,

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.730
the false labeling of humankind

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:18.049
and the immorality will not continue.

00:11:18.049 --> 00:11:21.809
For his own namesake and for those who love him,

00:11:21.809 --> 00:11:27.610
Jehovah will bring to ruin those ruining the earth.

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:30.009
Well, it's one thing to consider Jehovah's view

00:11:30.009 --> 00:11:32.490
in such matters among ourselves,

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:35.450
but what are we doing to help other people?

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:39.490
What are we doing to build respect for Jehovah's view of the earth?

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:45.529
Jehovah's view of humankind and Jehovah's purpose for their future?

00:11:45.529 --> 00:11:46.970
Well, with a clear conscience,

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.850
we can confidently say that we've not held back

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:53.009
in speaking the truth about such matters.

00:11:53.009 --> 00:11:54.570
For example,

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:58.049
here are some of the articles on JW.org

00:11:58.049 --> 00:12:00.289
that honest-hearted ones can read.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:04.690
For instance, what does the Bible say about abortion?

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:09.570
Does the Bible comment on same-sex marriages?

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:15.490
And how can I explain the Bible's view of homosexuality?

00:12:16.409 --> 00:12:20.690
We should be happy to have such tools to help other people.

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:24.009
So then what is more important to Jehovah,

00:12:24.009 --> 00:12:27.649
the literal planet, or the people?

00:12:27.649 --> 00:12:29.490
Both are highly valued,

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:33.610
and that is why both will endure forever.

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:38.610
But the people of the earth are far more important.

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:42.129
Jehovah gave his son as a ransom for mankind,

00:12:42.129 --> 00:12:44.370
not for a planet.

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:47.929
John 3.16 says that God loved the world so much

00:12:47.929 --> 00:12:50.330
that he gave his only begotten son,

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:54.169
so that everyone exercising faith in him

00:12:54.169 --> 00:12:57.370
might not be destroyed, destroyed,

00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:59.850
but have ever lasting life.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.970
And of Jesus, God's master worker,

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:07.730
Proverbs 8 and verse 31 quotes him as saying,

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:10.769
I rejoiced over his habitable earth,

00:13:10.769 --> 00:13:15.289
and I was especially fond of the sons of men.

00:13:16.289 --> 00:13:20.289
Knowing this, what should we continue to do?

00:13:20.289 --> 00:13:24.129
What we should kindly and respectfully help others

00:13:24.129 --> 00:13:28.129
to see Jehovah's view while there is still time?

00:13:28.129 --> 00:13:31.129
We must never become ashamed of the good news.

00:13:31.129 --> 00:13:34.529
For it's not just good news about paradise,

00:13:34.529 --> 00:13:37.370
it's also good news about Jehovah's time

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:40.169
to set things right on earth again.

00:13:40.169 --> 00:13:44.210
Parents with young children should take courage

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:48.610
from this fact as they work hard to protect their children

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:52.610
from Satan's attempts to ruin their minds and hearts

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:56.370
with immoral thoughts and false reasoning.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:59.649
Thankfully, the end is coming quickly.

00:14:00.809 --> 00:14:04.370
Please notice what is said at Revelation chapter 14

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:07.250
and verses 6 and 7.

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:11.769
And as we read it, look for what an angel includes

00:14:11.769 --> 00:14:14.490
in the good news that he declares.

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:19.490
It says in part, Revelation chapter 14 verses 6 and 7.

00:14:23.649 --> 00:14:26.889
It says he had ever lasting good news to declare to those

00:14:26.889 --> 00:14:31.009
who dwell on the earth to every nation and tribe

00:14:31.009 --> 00:14:32.809
and tongue in people.

00:14:32.809 --> 00:14:36.210
He was saying in a loud voice, fear God

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:39.889
and give him glory because the hour of judgment

00:14:39.929 --> 00:14:41.769
by him has arrived.

00:14:41.769 --> 00:14:45.649
So worship the one who made the heaven and the earth

00:14:45.649 --> 00:14:48.970
and the sea and the springs of water.

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:55.210
So then what does the angel include in his message

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:58.889
in his good news that he is declaring?

00:14:58.889 --> 00:15:01.690
Fear God, he said, and give him glory

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:06.250
because the hour of judgment by him has arrived.

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:08.169
For those who love what is right,

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:12.409
that truly is good news.

00:15:12.409 --> 00:15:15.570
And we're happy to include this angelic message

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:18.090
in what we share with other people.

00:15:19.289 --> 00:15:24.289
God's word assures us at Acts chapter 17 and verse 31

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:28.570
that Jehovah has said a day on which he purposes

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:32.289
to judge the inhabited earth and righteousness

00:15:32.289 --> 00:15:34.690
by means of his son.

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:37.850
What a relief and peace that will bring

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.730
to those who want to please Jehovah.

00:15:42.529 --> 00:15:44.529
Well in this talk we have examined

00:15:44.529 --> 00:15:47.330
what is meant when the Bible speaks of the earth.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:52.330
That is the planet and the people for whom it was made.

00:15:53.169 --> 00:15:55.970
We have also considered the fact that the earth

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:59.250
is being ruined in more ways than just the corrupting

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:03.490
of its environment and the misuse of its resources.

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:05.370
It goes far beyond that, doesn't it?

00:16:06.289 --> 00:16:09.289
Satan and his world are also attempting

00:16:09.289 --> 00:16:14.289
to ruin Jehovah's human creation in every way possible,

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:15.809
but they will fail.

00:16:16.769 --> 00:16:20.929
Since Jehovah gave his son to save faithful humans

00:16:20.929 --> 00:16:23.690
and to restore his purpose,

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:26.970
our next question is when will it happen?

00:16:28.049 --> 00:16:33.049
When will Jehovah bring to ruin those ruining the earth?

00:16:33.049 --> 00:16:35.330
Well the answer to that question is soon.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.730
Very soon, the ruining of mankind in their home

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:42.169
will not be allowed to go on.

00:16:42.169 --> 00:16:44.289
Let no one be mistaken about it.

00:16:44.289 --> 00:16:46.690
Jehovah is resolved.

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:48.250
He is patient.

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:51.450
He does not desire any to be destroyed,

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:53.009
but he is determined.

00:16:53.009 --> 00:16:55.370
His day is coming.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:00.970
Second Peter 313 assures us that there are new heavens

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:03.250
and a new earth that we are awaiting

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.250
according to his promise.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:09.930
That promised new earth is a new human society

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:14.930
that will worship and serve the only true God forever.

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:17.529
Those who persist in ruining the earth

00:17:17.529 --> 00:17:19.410
will not be a part of it.

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:23.089
At Matthew 19, verse 28,

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:26.410
Jesus speaks of this coming change

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:29.369
as a time of recreation.

00:17:30.289 --> 00:17:31.890
The study note for that verse says

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:36.569
that recreation means regeneration or renewal.

00:17:37.569 --> 00:17:40.609
It then adds that the recreation is

00:17:40.609 --> 00:17:44.329
the time when the rule of Christ and his co-rulers

00:17:44.329 --> 00:17:48.529
will bring to the earth a renewal of the perfect conditions

00:17:48.529 --> 00:17:52.130
enjoyed by the first humans before they sinned.

00:17:53.009 --> 00:17:56.490
That's wonderful to think about.

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:58.730
The recreation will set things straight

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:01.369
after a failed rebellion.

00:18:01.369 --> 00:18:05.650
It will fulfill Jehovah's purpose for the earth.

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:10.450
So then, what is the earth that is being ruined today?

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:13.809
As we have discussed, it is the planet

00:18:13.809 --> 00:18:18.009
and the people being corrupted by Satan's world.

00:18:18.009 --> 00:18:22.289
But what is the earth that will endure forever?

00:18:22.289 --> 00:18:24.569
First, the planet.

00:18:24.569 --> 00:18:26.809
As we have read, the scriptures are clear

00:18:26.809 --> 00:18:28.490
that it will last forever.

00:18:29.369 --> 00:18:33.609
Next and most important, the people, the new earth,

00:18:33.609 --> 00:18:38.609
those for whom Jesus died and who respond to the good news.

00:18:39.089 --> 00:18:41.369
The recreation is coming.

00:18:41.369 --> 00:18:46.569
Jesus will not waste a single day of the thousand years,

00:18:46.569 --> 00:18:50.089
not one day of it.

00:18:50.089 --> 00:18:52.609
He's determined to honor Jehovah

00:18:52.609 --> 00:18:57.390
and accomplish his purpose for the earth.

00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:59.509
The future is not complicated.

00:18:59.549 --> 00:19:03.950
Jehovah's purpose is not hard to understand.

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:05.789
The coming time of recreation

00:19:05.789 --> 00:19:08.670
will bring about a rejuvenated earth,

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:12.190
a rejuvenated planet filled with perfect people

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:16.029
who love and serve Jehovah together.

00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:20.230
That is the earth that will endure forever.
