00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:10.919
How do you feel when you have exerted yourself in some way and some when you deeply respect says to you, well done?

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:17.079
Don't you feel assured that your efforts were recognized and appreciated?

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:27.000
However, when you dear brothers and sisters in the 151st Class of Gilead arrive at your assignments and you exert yourself to

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.559
accomplish the work you've been given and give it yourself to encourage and help others.

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:39.479
Suppose you don't always receive an audible, well done from others.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.200
How will you feel?

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:46.280
Does that mean that your efforts were not appreciated and recognized?

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.600
To answer those questions, we're going to consider first what Jesus had to say on the subject.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.479
Second, what we can learn from some Bible examples and third, what this means for you personally.

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:08.840
Although the desire to receive recognition from humans is normal, Jesus helps us to have a balanced view in Matthew

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.319
chapter 6. Please turn to Matthew chapter 6 and note verse 3, Matthew 6 verse 3,

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:23.000
but you, when making gifts of mercy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:29.640
Now, what did Jesus mean? Well, these gifts of mercy were really donations for needy ones,

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:38.359
but with these words, Jesus was exhorting his disciples not to imitate the insincere religious leaders

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:43.879
of his day, who publicized their gifts of mercy just to be recognized by humans.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.840
Now, what would be the result of heeding Jesus' words here in verse 3?

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:57.239
Well, Jesus explains in verse 4, he says, so that your gifts of mercy may be in secret.

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:03.640
Now, for a moment, think of the gifts of mercy, the kindnesses, the Theoretic assignments that you

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.639
have performed in secret. For example, likely you've many times telephoned, visited,

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:16.360
an ailing brother or sister just to reassure them of your love, your concern, and even pray with them,

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:24.599
or perhaps you spent considerable time being a spiritual mentor to a Christian youth,

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:30.599
or you may have given generously of yourself to encourage and provide practical assistance to a

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:38.280
distress brother or sister. All of this you did in secret. However, Jesus said,

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:45.800
someone you deeply respect did take note. Look there at Matthew 6, verse 4,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.159
he stated in the bit, be part, your father who looks on in secret. The point is Jehovah,

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:03.240
who resides in the heavens, is invisible to mankind. So he remains in secret as far as humans are

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:12.599
concerned. But your good deeds are recognized with approval by Jehovah. Now, how can we be sure of

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:20.520
that? Well, there are many Bible examples of faithful men and women, young and old whose good deeds

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:27.560
and heartfelt devotion were recognized with approval by Jehovah. One example is Obadaya, the

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:35.960
household steward of Wicked King Ahab. First King, chapter 18, explains that he discreetly, secretly

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:42.360
and cautiously hid 100 of Jehovah's prophets, so they would not be killed by Wicked Jezebel.

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:49.800
Now, as illustrated here, Obadaya supplied them with bread and water in groups of 50

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:57.240
in caves without being observed by others. How do we know that Jehovah in secret recognized

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:05.240
with approval this faithful, generous, compassionate man? Well, we know because his courageous acts are

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:13.719
recorded in the Bible for generations of people to read about. Another example is the young,

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:21.399
nameless, isgerlite girl mentioned in 2 Kings, chapter 5. She was taken away from her god-fearing

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:29.639
family by the Syrians. Now, as can be seen in this picture, although surrounded by false worship

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:37.959
is, she courageously told Nehemen's wife about Jehovah's prophet Elisha. That led to Nehemen's

00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:44.439
miraculous healing of his leprosy. It led to Nehemen becoming a worshiper of Jehovah and

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:51.319
it certainly contributed to Jehovah's praise. We don't know the name of that little girl,

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:59.720
do we? But Jehovah does, who in secret looked favorably on that young girl. So these two examples,

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:06.680
and many others in the scriptures, are sure you that your good deeds are noted by Jehovah.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:17.930
Please note, though, that Jehovah does more than just look on in secret. Look again, please,

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:29.370
at Matthew 6, verse 4. The B part, red in its entirety, says, then your father who looks on in secret

00:05:30.329 --> 00:05:37.769
will repay you. Often, Jehovah repays us in unexpected ways, in ways that are better and more

00:05:37.769 --> 00:05:46.649
meaningful than humans could ever give us in the way of recognition. But how does Jehovah

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:54.410
repay us? While there are many ways, we're going to focus just on three significant ones. One way is

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:03.050
mentioned in Matthew 5, verse 7. Matthew 5, 7, Jesus said, Happy other merciful since they will be

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:11.209
shown mercy. So by our being kind and merciful, Jehovah mercifully forgives us and allows us to

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:18.569
enjoy a warm personal relationship with him. A second way he repays us is mentioned in

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:27.529
Mark 10, verses 29 and 30. There, Jesus promised that we would receive 100 times more than anything we

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:35.050
sacrifice to serve Jehovah. And one resulting tangible reward that Jehovah provides is our ever

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:41.850
expanding, loving spiritual family. A third way he repays is by means of his promise of the

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:49.930
priceless reward of everlasting life in God's new world. And regarding righteous ones who perform

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:57.129
good deeds, but fall asleep in death before the end of this system, Jesus and Luke chapter 14,

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:03.050
verse 14 gave the assurance that they will be repaid in the resurrection. And then they will see

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:12.949
the full effect of Jehovah's recognition and blessing on their good deeds. In addition to your

00:07:13.829 --> 00:07:23.670
gifts of mercy and your new assignments, your heartfelt devotion will be reflected as you with

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:31.829
Jehovah's help, face and successfully endure various challenges, many of which others will know

00:07:31.829 --> 00:07:39.990
nothing about. But even though you may not receive recognition or a complimentary well done from

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:47.509
others for your good deeds, your kindnesses, your sacrifices, and your endurance, please remain

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:55.110
confident that you will be recognized with approval by a loving father, Jehovah. And as Jesus

00:07:55.110 --> 00:08:07.509
promised, Jehovah, who looks on in secret, will repay you.
