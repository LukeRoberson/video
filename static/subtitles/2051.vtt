00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:09.179
The Bible character, Job, became an outstanding example of integrity while undergoing adversity.

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.980
Job chapters one and two make clear that Job series of trials were actually initiated

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.739
by Satan the devil himself.

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:23.179
While the devil is not responsible for all the painful or tragic circumstances we face

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:29.059
today, he capitalizes on these in an effort to break our integrity.

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:35.259
We have used the account of Job as a template for a video in a modern-day setting.

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:38.859
Let me introduce you to the family that will be portrayed.

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:42.380
We have named them the banisters.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.939
This is Ethan and his wife Sasha.

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:47.740
They have two boys.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.259
The oldest is Rowan and the youngest Cory.

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:53.539
Ethan's father is Nathaniel.

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:59.259
He now lives alone after the death of his wife, but enjoys spending time with his grandsons.

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:02.539
Next, we will introduce you to Bill.

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.379
He is Ethan's brother.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.459
He never got baptized and determined in his late teens that he did not want to be one

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:11.620
of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.939
Many of you have faced serious tragedies in life.

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:22.180
Like Job, you may have dealt with a series of them within a short period of time.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.659
Others of you may have to deal with something similar in the future.

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.019
Severe trials are difficult to deal with, and they can emotionally affect even those

00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:38.140
with strong faith, as was the case with Job.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:45.659
Because of a series of trials at the banister family phase, the video is sobering by nature.

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.700
But often, so are the realities that we are forced to deal with.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.739
Now please, watch this gripping video, and despite any trial, be determined to keep your

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:02.219
integrity and to hold on to the hope that you have come to cherish.
