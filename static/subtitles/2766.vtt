00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:15.039
Uh, yours?

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:16.539
Yeah, thanks.

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:17.739
You're Lily, right?

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:19.640
Yeah, and you're Sean.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.140
Yeah, I've seen you around.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.839
You play a good basketball.

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:26.039
Thanks, so do you.

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.039
So you want to hang out sometime?

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.600
Sure.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.969
My name is Lily, and I sort of have this problem.

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.670
There's a boy named Sean that recently moved to our school.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.369
I know I'm not supposed to like anyone who's not a witness.

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:52.570
The trouble was he is a witness.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.369
Sean and his family moved into our congregation.

00:00:56.369 --> 00:01:00.369
And the more I saw of him, the more I liked him.

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:03.170
I strength this exhaustive because of my side.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:30.150
If only I knew where to find them.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.640
Like I said, I had a problem.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.519
Every day I see couples my age at school.

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:48.069
To me, they look happy.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:55.359
Honestly, I wanted that happiness too.

00:01:55.359 --> 00:02:06.540
My parents noticed my problem too, and talked about it that night.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.840
I'm pretty soon.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.439
I didn't feel alone anymore.

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:15.740
The next day, my mom invited me to go with her to run an errand.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.340
Afterward, we went to a little cafe.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.240
She asked me how things were going.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.139
At first, I didn't want to tell her,

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.139
but she made me feel really comfortable.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.039
So I told her my feelings for Sean.

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:34.740
Expecting her to think bad of me, but she didn't.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.240
Everything you're feeling is naturally.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.240
I remember having the same feelings when I was your age too.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.939
Really?

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:44.240
It's true.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.539
That's just how Jehovah created us, honey.

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:53.240
And because he created us, he knows the best way for us to be happy.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.139
And that's all he wants for us.

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:00.039
And that's all daddy, and I want for you too.

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:01.539
She didn't scold me.

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:04.340
She didn't make me feel embarrassed.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.939
And most importantly, she didn't seem to be in a rush.

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:12.840
My mom wasn't the only one helping me.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.039
My dad was preparing to help me with my problem too.

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:19.939
That evening, we had family worship.

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:23.840
And once again, they just let me talk.

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:26.439
They told me I didn't have to hold back.

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:27.539
So I didn't.

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:29.139
I just don't know what to do.

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:32.639
Lily, thank you for telling us how you feel.

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.740
Let me ask you something.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.039
Why do you think Jehovah created us with these natural feelings

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:41.340
toward the opposite sex?

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.139
So that one day a man or woman can marry.

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:46.340
That's right.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.240
In fact, a good marriage is like two skaters on the ice.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.340
A beautiful performance can seem effortless,

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.740
but is it really?

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.740
No.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.240
No one would even attempt that without practice,

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.240
a capable partner, or the right kind of guidance, right?

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.240
Yeah.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.740
Well, it's the same with a good marriage, sweetie.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.740
It doesn't just happen.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:16.740
It, too, depends on a good partner, coordinated effort,

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:22.240
but most importantly, wise counsel from Jehovah.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.939
In fact, could you please turn with me

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:30.639
to Psalm chapter 32 and verse 8 and read that for us?

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.240
Sure.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.439
It says, I will give you insight and instruct you

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:38.040
in the way you should go.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.339
I will give you advice with my eye upon you.

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:44.240
Lily, Jehovah loves us very much.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.740
And if we listen to him, we'll make good decisions

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.740
in our life with absolutely no regrets.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.639
We talk some more, and then I got some homework.

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.839
My dad gave me some articles he printed out for me to read.

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:03.240
So I did.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.240
And as I read the words and started meditating on them,

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.040
I realized something.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.540
By holding off dating a little longer,

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.569
I wasn't missing out.

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:21.670
Rather, I was preparing myself.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:27.069
I could use the time now to focus on something much more important.

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:30.569
My relationship with Jehovah.

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:32.870
I could also gain Christian qualities

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.870
and experience that will help me later

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:49.899
if I ever do get married.

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:52.500
The big day finally arrived.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.000
After all those months of preparation,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.899
it was just as I imagined.

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:59.399
Or wait.

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:02.000
That's not me.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:09.870
That's me.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:19.379
As I watched my sister get married that day.

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:31.639
I couldn't help but think about my own future.

00:06:31.639 --> 00:07:00.879
When I began dating Shane, everything was perfect.

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:16.389
We spent a lot of time talking on the phone.

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:19.290
Everything just naturally seemed to click.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:38.620
I was convinced.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:53.529
He was the one.

00:07:53.529 --> 00:07:56.329
But over time,

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:11.120
I started to notice some things.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:35.539
I was starting to see patterns.

00:08:35.539 --> 00:09:08.200
And they didn't seem to be getting better.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:24.179
I wasn't even sure our goals were the same anymore.

00:09:24.179 --> 00:09:32.940
I felt alone.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:42.730
But thankfully, I wasn't.

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:45.830
My mom kindly asked how things were going.

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:49.230
So I told her.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:53.429
Maybe he's not the one I told her.

00:09:53.429 --> 00:09:55.029
I thought she was going to tell me

00:09:55.129 --> 00:09:57.129
which way I should go.

00:09:57.129 --> 00:09:58.830
But she didn't.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:03.230
Instead, she reassured me that if he wasn't the one,

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:28.330
I was going to be okay.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.830
They reminded me about what Jesus said

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:35.039
when building a tower.

00:10:35.039 --> 00:10:36.039
For example,

00:10:36.039 --> 00:10:38.039
who of you wanting to build a tower

00:10:38.039 --> 00:10:41.340
does not first sit down and calculate the expense

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:45.419
to see if he has enough to complete it.

00:10:45.419 --> 00:10:47.720
I realized that I was about to enter

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.919
into a building project of my own,

00:10:49.919 --> 00:10:51.720
my relationship with Shane.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.620
And I too needed to calculate the expense

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.320
before I commit to it.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.919
They encouraged me to talk to Shane

00:10:59.919 --> 00:11:07.590
and tell him about the things that were concerning me.

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:16.159
So I did.

00:11:16.159 --> 00:11:18.559
And my mom was right.

00:11:18.559 --> 00:11:20.159
I was okay.

00:11:20.159 --> 00:11:22.159
More than okay, really.

00:11:22.159 --> 00:11:30.500
Shane and I decided it was best to break off the relationship.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.100
And some years later,

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:38.740
I found someone that loved your hover as much as I do.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.240
And I love him with my whole heart.
