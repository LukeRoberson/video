00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.800
When Job was at his lowest point in life,

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.100
three of his companions came to offer him comfort,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.500
and they failed miserably.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.000
But what if their situations had been reversed?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.899
What would Job have done?

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:31.100
He said, as recorded at Job 165,

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.200
I would strengthen you with the words of my mouth,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.399
and the consolation of my lips would bring relief.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.700
Today more than ever, people need encouragement and comfort,

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.500
so we should always aim to be a building and positive.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.000
What does that take?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.799
We need to cultivate a positive view of our listeners,

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:02.700
limit negative material, and make good use of God's Word.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.000
Why is it important to cultivate a positive view of our listeners?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Because our viewpoint will be reflected in our teaching.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.299
Let's watch an elder giving a local needs talk with the theme,

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.400
cultivate the habit of being punctual.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.200
How do you think he views his audience?

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.400
The elders have chosen this theme

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.900
because many just don't seem to understand the importance of punctuality.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.799
And have the habit of arriving late for meetings.

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.599
In this talk, we will answer these questions.

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:52.500
How does being late show a lack of appreciation for Jehovah's provisions?

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:00.200
And when you are constantly late, how is this inconsiderate of others?

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.500
The speaker seemed to be irritated, didn't he?

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:08.000
Because he didn't have a positive view of the audience,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.599
his approach was critical, not constructive.

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.599
Such a talk wouldn't be very motivating.

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.199
Let's watch the elder try again.

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:25.000
Notice how a positive view of his audience affects his teaching.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.699
The elders asked me to commend you for your effort to be punctual.

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:36.000
Our theme, cultivate the habit of being punctual,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.900
was chosen because as busy in perfect humans,

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.900
we all have a challenge to be on time for meetings.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.400
In this talk, we will answer these questions.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.900
Why is it important to be punctual?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And what are some practical suggestions to help us arrive one time?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.400
Did you notice that he first commended the congregation?

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.900
The speaker believes that his audience wants to be on time and pleased Jehovah.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.800
So his approach was positive, focusing on how to be punctual,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.400
rather than how to avoid being late.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.500
This made his talk up building.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.000
A positive view of our listeners is also important when we're in the ministry.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.199
If we believe that behind every door is a potential fellow believer,

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:39.400
we'll preach with enthusiasm.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.900
To be a building in positive, we must also limit negative material.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.500
Of course, life in this system of things has negative aspects that cannot be ignored.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:04:00.400
However, when teaching, we should include negative material only when it serves a useful purpose.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.199
For example, the introduction of a talk may call for us to discuss the failure of human rule,

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:12.199
reports of crime and violence, or the shocking prevalence of immorality.

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:18.699
But if we were to consider such things at length, the effect may be depressing.

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:23.199
The overall tone of the talk should be positive.

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:27.899
When in the ministry, we sometimes start a conversation by raising a problem

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:30.899
that's on the minds of those in our territory.

00:04:30.899 --> 00:04:37.000
However, the purpose of our visit is to share the good news of the kingdom.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:45.600
So at an early point in the conversation, we should try to direct attention to refreshing Bible truths.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.500
How do you think the publisher does in the following demonstration?

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.800
We're making brief visits to help people manage their stress.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.199
Does it seem to you that people are more stressed today than they were in the past?

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.500
I think people are more stressed.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.600
Crime is getting worse, and many people are afraid.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.100
Many people feel pressure to make ends meet.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.000
Then there's the very real threat of nuclear war.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.600
I'm not interested.

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:19.399
The conversation ended because the publisher spent too much time talking about negative things.

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:22.300
Let's watch her try again.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.300
We're making brief visits to help people manage their stress.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.500
Does it seem to you that people are more stressed today than they were in the past?

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.899
I think people are more stressed.

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:37.699
Many have found that the practical advice in the Bible helps them manage their stress.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.100
Here's one example. It's found at Matthew 634.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.800
Much better.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:51.300
Instead of dwelling on the problems, the publisher directed the householder to something positive.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:57.899
The best way to be a building and positive is to base our words on the Bible.

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:01.000
So use the Bible when we're applying to questions.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.600
And when giving a talk, teach from the scriptures.

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:13.699
In our teaching, we should focus on things that will improve a situation and that inspire confidence.

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:18.199
In this way, we'll be a building and positive.
