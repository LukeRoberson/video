00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.940
For telling dominant traits that would exist in the last days,

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.939
2 Timothy chapter 3 says that men will be lovers of themselves.

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:13.939
Is it wrong for us to love ourselves?

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:15.939
No, it's normal.

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:18.940
Even necessary to have a healthy love of oneself.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.940
After all, Jesus said,

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.940
you must love your neighbor as yourself.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.940
And we'll talk more about that in a minute.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.939
However, the love mentioned here is distorted and selfish.

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:37.939
And because it prevents love of neighbor,

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:41.939
it becomes a barrier to peace.

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:44.939
Some Bible scholars suggested Paul put love of self

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:46.939
at the top of his list,

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:49.939
that 2 Timothy chapter 3 verses 1 through 5,

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:53.939
because all the remaining negative characteristics in the list

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:55.939
result from it.

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:57.939
And those traits, too,

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:59.939
are a barrier to peace.

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:00.939
For example,

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:06.939
not being open to any agreement mentioned in 2 Timothy chapter 3 and verse 3,

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:09.939
often leads to anger, wrath,

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:13.939
screaming, and abuse of speech.

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:15.939
Rather than bringing peace,

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.939
such a lack of self-control stirs up strife.

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:21.939
On the other hand,

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:25.939
love of neighbor has the opposite effect.

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.939
It leads to genuine peace.

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:36.939
Please turn to Matthew chapter 22 verse 36.

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:43.939
One of the Pharisees versed in the law tests Jesus.

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:45.939
Teacher,

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.939
which is the greatest commandment in the law?

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.939
Jesus responded with the words in verse 37,

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.939
just considered at length in the preceding talk.

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.939
You must love Jehovah your God.

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.939
But then Jesus goes beyond the original question

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.939
and quotes a second commandment.

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.939
Let's read verse 39.

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:13.939
The second like it is this.

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:17.939
You must love your neighbor as yourself.

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:22.219
Jesus is saying that the two commandments,

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:27.219
love of God and love of neighbor, are linked.

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:32.219
Now, how exactly would you define neighbor?

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:35.219
Please turn to Luke chapter 10.

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:40.659
Notice how Jesus answered this very question,

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.659
who really is my neighbor?

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.659
Jesus responds clearly with his renowned illustration

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:48.659
of the neighborly Samaritan.

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:52.659
In Jesus' day, the Jews disdained Samaritans.

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:57.659
Their attitude moved Jesus to make a powerful point.

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.659
In his illustration, Jesus said that the Samaritan

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.659
took extraordinary measures to help a Jewish man.

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:07.659
The Jew had fallen victim to robbers

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:09.659
and his own countrymen,

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.659
ignoring, leaving him half dead.

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:17.659
What Jesus said must have stunned the audience.

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:21.659
Luke chapter 10 verses 33 and 34 reads,

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:26.419
but a certain Samaritan,

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:28.419
traveling the road came upon him,

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:32.419
and at seeing him, he was moved with pity.

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:36.419
So he approached him and bandaged his wounds,

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:39.419
pouring oil and wine on them.

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.419
Then he mounted him on his own animal

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:46.419
and brought him to an inn and took care of him.

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:52.419
Jesus then asked a penetrating question in verse 36.

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:59.419
Who of these three seems to you to have made himself neighbor?

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:06.419
His words recorded in verse 37 are also directed to you and to me.

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:09.419
Go and do the same yourself.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.860
Yes, our neighbors include not only our family members

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.860
and our Christian brothers and sisters,

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.860
but all whom we encounter from day to day.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:26.860
In other words, our love extends to those who are not of our own race,

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.860
tribe, nationality, or religion.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.110
How do we show that love?

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.110
Please turn with me to Romans chapter 13.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.110
Because we love our neighbor,

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.110
we avoid conduct that disrupts peace.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:54.110
Instead, we strive to apply the Inspired Council at Romans chapter 13

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.110
verses 8 through 10.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:02.490
Do not owe anything to anyone except to love one another.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.490
For whoever loves his fellow man has fulfilled the law.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.490
For the law code, you must not commit adultery, you must not murder,

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.490
you must not steal, you must not covet,

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:18.490
and whatever other commandment there is is summed up in this saying,

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.490
you must love your neighbor as yourself.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.490
Love does not work equal to one's neighbor.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.740
Therefore, love is the law's fulfillment.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.740
That means that our responsibility is to treat others in ways that promote peace.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.740
When others treat us unkindly, we endeavor to imitate Jesus.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.740
When he was being insulted, he did not return the insult.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.740
When he was suffering, he didn't go threatening.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.740
Imitating the Prince of Peace and the God of Peace gives us inner peace.

00:05:59.269 --> 00:06:02.269
In the following dramatization, notice how a family benefits

00:06:02.269 --> 00:06:09.649
from the Apostle Paul's example of displaying love of neighbor even when provoked.

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:11.649
What are you going to do? You're just a coward.

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:13.649
Man, all you do is stand next to your little car.

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:15.649
You don't do anything. You just stand next to your little car.

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:17.649
Just a cow or a nutro or rice a cow.

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:20.649
Gabe, what happened today?

00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:27.259
It's just, I've been yelled at in service before,

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:32.259
but this time I wanted to, I don't know.

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:37.259
I wanted to go up to the girls and smash their phones.

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:39.259
I'm so glad that you didn't.

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:49.540
Yeah, but I feel guilty because I was like, it was like so angry.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:59.660
It's okay. Let's keep reading.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.660
We had left often, verse 26.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:10.879
Suddenly, a great earthquake occurred

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:14.879
so that the foundations of the jail were shaken.

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:18.879
Moreover, all the doors were instantly open,

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:21.879
and everyone's bonds came loose.

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:25.879
When the jailer woke up and saw that the prison doors were open,

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:29.879
he drew his sword and was about to kill himself,

00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:32.879
assuming that the prisoners had escaped.

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:35.879
But Paul called out with a loud voice.

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:38.879
Do not hurt yourself for we're all here.

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:43.800
So he asked for lights in Washington

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.800
and seized with trembling.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:51.810
He fell down before Paul and Silas.

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:54.810
Now, think about what the jailer had done to Paul.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:08:01.899
He could have hated him for it.

00:08:01.899 --> 00:08:05.879
Yeah, he could have.

00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:09.879
But I guess he saw the jailer's pain instead of just his own.

00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:17.129
Yeah, Paul loved his neighbor.

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:20.129
He didn't hold back trying to save his life.

00:08:20.129 --> 00:08:41.850
Hey, how do you get the nerve to keep coming out here?

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:45.580
Look, you were right.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.580
How about what you said?

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.580
No one should stand around

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.580
while other people suffer injustice.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:54.580
So do something, fight like we do.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.580
This is my way of making a difference.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.580
The only way that I know the world can really change.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.580
Come on, man, the Bible?

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:02.580
Like, I get where you're thinking,

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.580
but let me show you just one scripture.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.580
All right, one scripture.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.580
So this is a verse in the Bible that convinced me

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.580
of how I can make a difference.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:16.580
It's a Matthew chapter 24 verse 40.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.580
Here it says,

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.580
and this good news of the kingdom

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.580
will be preached in all of the inhabited earth

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.580
for a witness to all the nations

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.580
and then the end will come.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:34.450
In the dramatization,

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:38.450
Paul could have reacted in a negative way towards the jailer.

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:42.450
However, in spite of the way he had been treated,

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:45.450
he displayed neighborly love.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:48.450
And this had a powerful effect on the jailer

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:51.450
and brought praise to Jehovah.

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:54.450
Because we are imperfect,

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:56.450
we must work hard

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:59.450
at cultivating love for our neighbor.

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:01.450
This is illustrated in what happened

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:04.450
with the Apostle Peter.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:07.450
Prior to becoming a follower of Jesus,

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:11.450
he did not have fellowship with non-Jewish people.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:14.450
But after he became a Christian,

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:17.450
God taught him that division

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.450
between Jews and Gentiles

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:21.450
was not to continue.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.450
And Peter got the point.

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:28.450
It acts chapter 10 verses 34 and 35.

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:30.450
Peter is quoted as saying,

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:35.450
Now I truly understand that God is not partial,

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:38.450
but in every nation the man who fears him

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:40.450
and works what is right

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.450
is acceptable to him.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:46.450
Peter even stayed in the newly converted Gentiles home

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.450
for days.

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:51.450
And he continued the practice of eating

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:54.450
with non-Jewish Christians.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:57.450
However, 13 years later,

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.450
while in Syrian Antioch,

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.450
Peter suddenly stopped associating

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:04.450
with Gentile Christians.

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:06.450
Why?

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:08.450
He feared the reaction of some Jewish Christians

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:11.450
who were slow to accept change.

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:15.450
This illustrates that prejudice can be deeply rooted.

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:19.450
It takes constant effort to read ourselves of it.

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:23.450
But we must learn to view others impartially

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.450
as Jehovah does.

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:29.450
We want to treat others as Jehovah treats them.

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:32.450
In his sermon on the Mount,

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:34.450
Jesus said,

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:36.450
You heard it was said,

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:38.450
You must love your neighbor

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:40.450
and hate your enemy.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:43.450
However, I say to you,

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:45.450
continue to love your enemies

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:49.450
and to pray for those who persecute you.

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:53.450
Then, as recorded in Matthew chapter 5,

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:56.450
and verse 45,

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:59.450
he explains why we want to show that type of love,

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:03.860
so that you may prove yourself sons

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.860
of your father who is in the heavens

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.860
since he makes his son rise on both the wicked and the good

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:14.860
and makes it rain on both the righteous and the unrighteous.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.860
This love,

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:18.860
produced by Holy Spirit,

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.860
is markedly different from the sort of love

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.860
that is common in the world.

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:26.860
It's based on a higher principle.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:27.860
Jesus said,

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:31.860
Even sinners will follow a policy of like for like.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.860
But if we want to prove ourselves sons

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.860
of our father who is in the heavens,

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.860
it must be different.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.860
We welcome others,

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.860
as God and Christ have welcomed us.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:49.860
At Romans 157, the Bible says to us,

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.860
Welcome one another,

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:55.860
just as Christ also welcomed you.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.860
The Greek word used there

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:01.860
conveys the idea of receiving someone kindly or hospitably,

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:05.860
such as into one's home or circle of friends.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:10.860
Prejudice withers as love grows.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:13.860
Remember that at one time,

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.860
we were all strangers or foreigners,

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.860
not close to God,

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:24.860
but Jehovah drew us to Him with cords of love.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.860
Christ welcomed us.

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:29.860
He opened the doors at were

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:33.860
so that we could become part of God's family.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.860
Since Jesus has kindly accepted us,

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.860
as imperfect as we are,

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:44.860
it should be unthinkable for us to reject anyone else.

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.860
Dear brothers and sisters,

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.860
divisions, prejudice and hostility

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.860
will doubtless increase in the world

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:54.860
as we approach the end of this wicked system.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.860
As servants of Jehovah, though,

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.860
we seek the wisdom from above,

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:04.860
which is impartial and promotes peace.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:08.860
We rejoice as we forge friendships

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.860
with people from other lands,

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:12.860
accept cultural differences,

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:16.860
and possibly even learn the languages of others.

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.860
When we do this,

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.860
peace flows just like a river

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.860
and justice like the waves of the sea.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.860
We work what is good toward all,

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.860
but especially our brothers.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.860
Love of neighbor moves us to make sacrifices

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:36.860
in behalf of others,

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:37.860
and to share the good news

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:41.200
at every opportunity,

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.200
our master, Jesus,

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.200
said,

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.200
This is my commandment

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.200
that you love one another

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:54.200
just as I have loved you.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:59.200
What are the blessings that come from love of neighbor?

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.200
Jesus answers that

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.200
at John chapter 15

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:10.720
and we'll read verses eight through ten,

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.539
beginning with verse eight.

00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:16.539
Number one,

00:15:16.539 --> 00:15:20.539
My Father is glorified in this,

00:15:20.539 --> 00:15:23.539
that you keep bearing much fruit

00:15:23.539 --> 00:15:27.539
and prove yourselves my disciples.

00:15:27.539 --> 00:15:29.539
The second blessing,

00:15:29.539 --> 00:15:31.539
verse nine,

00:15:31.539 --> 00:15:33.539
Just as the Father has loved me,

00:15:33.539 --> 00:15:35.539
so I have loved you

00:15:35.539 --> 00:15:38.539
remain in my love.

00:15:38.539 --> 00:15:41.539
If you observe my commandments,

00:15:41.539 --> 00:15:44.539
you will remain in my love.

00:15:44.539 --> 00:15:47.539
Just as I have observed the commandments of the Father

00:15:47.539 --> 00:15:52.110
and remain in his love.

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:54.110
Brother Robert Saranco,

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:55.110
a helper to the writing committee,

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:58.110
will now present the final talk of this symposium,

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:01.110
how love leads to genuine peace,

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:03.110
love for God's Word.
