00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:09.570
Welcome. Since our last update, we've had five more special conventions. They

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:17.329
were held in the following locations. Prague, Czech Republic, Helsinki, Finland,

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:25.170
Budapest, Hungary, Reykjavik, Iceland and Zurich, Switzerland.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.969
delegates came from over 30 countries. It's a joy to see the love and unity of

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:40.170
Jehovah's people. A total of 578 were baptized at these conventions. A highlight

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.689
of the special convention in Iceland was the release of the complete New World

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:51.090
translation in Icelandic. The rich spiritual food at this year's convention

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.850
refreshes and strengthens us to keep declaring the good news. Of course as we

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.329
think about the ministry, we have a mind and new service year that's approaching

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.129
rapidly. Maybe you'll remember that beginning September 1, we will have an

00:01:09.129 --> 00:01:15.290
exciting worldwide campaign to offer Bible studies. It's good for us to begin

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:22.329
preparing now. During the campaign, we'll offer Bible studies to as many people as

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:29.290
possible using the enjoy life forever brochure. For that month, auxiliary pioneers

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.569
will have the option of choosing either a 15-hour requirement or a 30-hour

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:39.769
requirement. Why not take a few minutes this week to look at your schedule for

00:01:39.769 --> 00:01:47.290
September? Briefly, consider if you can expand your ministry that month. We also

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:54.010
have something very encouraging to share with you. On Sunday, July 28, we reached a

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:00.010
special landmark with regard to Bible translation. The New World translation is

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:09.449
now available in whole or in part in 300 languages. Isn't that amazing? We have

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:16.110
so many exciting things happening in Jehovah's organization. But now for the

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.870
rest of our update, I'd like to speak with you about an important topic. The need

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.349
to remain focused on God's kingdom as the real solution to mankind's problems.

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:34.789
This vital truth helps us to stay neutral regarding the world's political

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:42.229
issues. This year's regional convention helps us to keep this point in mind. At

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:48.830
the convention, we get to enjoy Episode 1 of the Good News according to Jesus. It

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:55.669
reminds us how the appearance of the Messiah was such good news. With Jesus

00:02:55.669 --> 00:03:02.069
arrival on the earth, all the promises of God would now come true through Him. And

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:08.069
what would these promises include? That the real solution to mankind's

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:16.460
problems, God's kingdom would be established with Jesus as King. What qualities does

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:25.740
Jesus manifest as King? Isaiah 9, 6 and 7, prophetically describes Jesus this way. For a

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:32.219
child has been born to us. A son has been given to us. And the rulership will

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:37.939
rest on his shoulder. His name will be called wonderful counselor, mighty God,

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:44.620
eternal Father, Prince of Peace. To the increase of his rulership and to

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.139
peace, there will be no end on the throne of David and on his kingdom in order

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:56.340
to establish it firmly and to sustain it through justice and righteousness from

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:04.819
now on and forever. The zeal of Jehovah's armies will do this. These verses

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:11.939
show us that Jesus' rulership is characterized by peace, justice and righteousness.

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:20.980
And his rulership will continue forever. How reassuring that is. We're

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.819
grateful to know that God's kingdom is already established in heaven. It is

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:30.860
already the real permanent solution to all of the problems of the human

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:39.939
family. But we need to keep this reality clearly in mind. Why? Because the

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:45.459
times we live in can make it challenging to keep focused on God's kingdom as the

00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:51.819
real solution to all of our problems. There are many things that divide the

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:59.579
world today. There's so much unrest in many conflicts. This constant effort to

00:04:59.579 --> 00:05:06.620
make people take sides on political questions and even elections. In fact, it's

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.620
estimated that billions of people, nearly half the Earth's population, living

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:20.180
countries where there will be or have been political elections this year. We

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:26.660
also see an increase of nationalism and patriotic ceremonies, including schools.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:33.540
Even sporting events can stir up nationalistic divisions. All of these

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:41.779
things are in the news every day. The world is facing unprecedented problems and

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:48.899
imperfect humans have many ideas on how to solve them. But as Jehovah's

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:55.379
witnesses, how do we view these device of topics? Of course, we don't get

00:05:55.379 --> 00:06:02.819
involved in politics. We remember Jesus' words at John 1836 where he said,

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:11.660
My kingdom is no part of this world. As a result, we give our whole hearted

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.699
allegiance to that kingdom and do not become involved in the politics of this

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:25.379
world. Of course, Romans 131 and 2 indicates that the secular authorities stand

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:32.220
placed in their relative positions by God. Therefore, we appreciate and deeply

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:38.259
respect the role of that government's have today. This is in harmony with Jesus

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:45.100
words recorded at Matthew 22, 21, where he said, Pay back therefore Caesar's

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:52.540
things to Caesar, but God's things to God. So while we show honor to those who

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:57.819
hold positions of authority in the government, we don't get involved in

00:06:57.819 --> 00:07:03.699
political issues or debates, no matter how right or just a particular cause

00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:12.540
may seem. We keep on seeking first God's kingdom and His righteousness. We know

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:18.819
that is the real solution. So we don't take sides on the world's issues even

00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:24.180
mentally. We don't favor one candidate or political party over another,

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:31.420
regardless of whether they seem to support or oppose our interests. We keep

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:40.810
focused on the real solution God's kingdom in the hands of Christ Jesus. What

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:49.009
can help us to protect our neutrality? We'll briefly mention two ways. First, we

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:55.170
can spend more time focusing on the solution than on the problem. And second,

00:07:55.170 --> 00:08:02.769
we can spend more time talking about the solution than the problem. Let's discuss

00:08:02.769 --> 00:08:08.610
the first way. What can help us to spend more time focusing on the solution

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:15.970
rather than the problem? Daily Bible reading and meditation. That will help us

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:21.810
to keep our spiritual armor intact. And we safeguard our heart by limiting

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:26.930
how much time we spend listening to or reading news and social media

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:34.370
websites, which can leave us anxious, depressed and even exhausted. A second

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:39.570
way we can protect our neutrality is to spend more time talking about the

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:46.049
solution than the problem. Isn't it true that our speech indicates what's in

00:08:46.049 --> 00:08:51.730
our heart? What if we freely express strong opinions regarding this world's

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:59.009
elections? Wars or other political matters? What that indicate that our neutrality

00:08:59.009 --> 00:09:06.210
has weakened? This could be like a warning indicator light on a car. Our speech

00:09:06.289 --> 00:09:10.370
might indicate that we need to give our neutrality some attention.

00:09:12.129 --> 00:09:17.490
The best way to talk about the solution is by preaching the good news of God's kingdom.

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:26.049
This helps us to stay focused. We're convinced that Jehovah will remedy all injustices that we face.

00:09:27.649 --> 00:09:34.610
Preaching helps us to keep our hope clear in mind. Hope is an anchor which stabilizes us

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:41.889
during turbulent times. It prevents us from drifting away from Jehovah or his organization.

00:09:43.409 --> 00:09:50.370
If we continue to do all these things, we'll remain neutral regarding this world's politics.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:10:01.149
And we'll stay focused on the real solution God's kingdom. The governing body is sharing

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:07.870
these important reminders because Satan, the ruler of this world, is pressuring Jehovah's people

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:18.990
like never before. The devil wants us to take sides on these issues. If we do, we are no longer neutral.

00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:26.350
We could even find ourselves taking a stand against Jehovah and against his kingdom.

00:10:26.669 --> 00:10:33.070
In effect, we could be acting as though we think the devil has the solution to our problems.

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:41.070
Never would we want that to happen. So dear brothers and sisters, this is a matter that requires

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:48.590
our careful and preferable attention. To help us keep the real solution clearly in mind,

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:55.950
make it a priority to have a personal or family worship study project on the topic of neutrality.

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:02.269
Here are a few ideas. In the book Scriptures for Christian Living,

00:11:03.149 --> 00:11:09.950
you could review the information about governments. To find this publication in J.W. Library,

00:11:10.669 --> 00:11:21.379
go to the Library tab, then publications, then books. Another idea is to review the October

00:11:21.379 --> 00:11:26.500
2023 Watchtower Study article entitled, are you ready to obey?

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:34.740
The March 2019 edition of J.W. Broadcasting had an excellent discussion about neutrality.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:43.460
To find this in J.W. Library, go to the Library tab, then video, J.W. Broadcasting,

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:52.980
and then look under monthly programs. Or on J.W.org searched for March 2019 broadcast.

00:11:54.899 --> 00:12:01.460
Of course on J.W.org, if you search neutrality, you'll find many other helpful videos and articles.

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:10.610
We can be sure that Jehovah's heart rejoices to see millions of people from all nations of the

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:17.970
earth united in worshiping him, remaining neutral, and declaring the real solution to mankind's

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:26.850
problems, the good news of God's kingdom. Brothers and sisters, please know that we love you all very

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:33.970
much. From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is J.W. Broadcasting.
