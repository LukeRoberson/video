00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.700
Well, it's obvious that our subject for this morning is the transfiguration of Jesus.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.099
And I thought we considered two points about that event.

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.900
First, how Jesus and the apostles were affected by it,

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.399
and then how Bible prophecy and the transfiguration should affect all of us.

00:00:18.399 --> 00:00:20.699
Let's first remind ourselves about that event.

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.399
Term with me, please, to Luke 9.

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:28.399
Luke 9, now Matthew and Mark also wrote about the event.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.200
But as we read Luke's account, we'd like you to imagine yourself witnessing the scene.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.299
Now, the insight on the scriptures tells us that the transfiguration may have taken place on a spur of Mount Herman.

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:43.100
It was at night.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.799
Recently, if you look there in Luke 9.27,

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:51.799
Jesus had told his apostles that some of them would not taste death until they'd seen the kingdom of God.

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:55.200
Let's see what happened next, verse 28.

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:58.600
In fact, about eight days after saying these words,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.299
he took Peter, John, and James along and climbed up the mountain to pray.

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:07.500
And as he was praying, the appearance of his face changed,

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.700
and his clothing became glitteringly white.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.799
And look, two men were conversing with him.

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.799
They were Moses and Elijah.

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.799
These appeared with glory and began talking about his departure,

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.099
which he was about to fulfill a Jerusalem.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.599
Now Peter and those with him were way down with sleep.

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:33.599
But when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:37.099
And as these were departing from him, Peter said to Jesus,

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:40.200
instructor, it is fine for us to be here.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.000
So let us erect three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.700
He did not realize what he was saying.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.700
But as he was saying these things, a cloud formed and began to overshadow them

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.500
as they entered into the cloud, they became afraid.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.299
Then a voice came out of the cloud saying,

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.200
this is my son, the one who has been chosen.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.299
Listen to him.

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.699
As the voice spoke, Jesus was found alone.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:12.199
What an event.

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:15.199
Imagine how you would have reacted if you'd been there.

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:18.300
Jesus face shown as the sun.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.800
His garments glisten.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.900
Mark's account states that his garments were far wider than any clothes cleaner on Earth could widen them.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.699
Jesus spoke to Moses and Elijah, great prophets of old who had been dead for centuries.

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:33.800
Of course, they weren't there literally.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.000
This was just a vision.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.599
But then the climax, God's voice identified Jesus as his son and commanded the apostles to listen to him.

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.599
If you had been there, that would be an event you would never forget.

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.000
But how were Jesus and the apostles affected?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.900
Well, Jesus must have been affected in a positive way.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.199
If you notice there, verses 30 and 31, it talks about Moses and Elijah speaking about Jesus departure,

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:06.800
evidently involving Jesus' death and resurrection to spirit life.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:14.199
The transfiguration, it seems, served to fortify Jesus for his sufferings and death that he would experience.

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:21.599
And Jesus' faith must have been strengthened when he heard his heavenly Father speak of him as his approved son.

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.300
How were the apostles affected?

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.199
What we see initially, did you notice the end of verse 34?

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:28.199
They became afraid.

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:33.500
Matthew's account says they fell face down and became very much afraid.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.400
But how did that event affect them afterwards?

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.099
Well, the transfiguration helped to strengthen the faith of these men who were to play a leading role in the Christian congregation.

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:51.199
For example, the events strengthened their faith that Jesus was God's son and the future King of God's kingdom.

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:55.099
The transfiguration strengthened their faith in Bible prophecy.

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:03.099
The event gave them convincing evidence that Jesus was the Messiah, the one whom their forefathers and prophesied about.

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:11.599
And that discussion with Moses and Elijah about Jesus departure strengthened the apostles' faith in Christ's resurrection.

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:18.899
So strong was their faith after the transfiguration that some expressed it with inspired words.

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:26.699
It could be that the Apostle John's words at John 1 verse 14 were influenced by the transfiguration.

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:27.899
He wrote,

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:34.399
so the word became flesh and resided among us and we had a view of his glory.

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:39.899
A glory such as belongs to an only begotten son from a Father.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.800
And as was mentioned, some 32 years after the event, about 64 CE, note with me what Peter still recalled.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.399
Second Peter, chapter 1, please turn there. Second Peter, chapter 1.

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:59.459
Notice what Peter recalled starting in verse 16.

00:04:59.459 --> 00:05:07.259
No, it was not by following artfully contrived false stories that we made known to you the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:11.959
But rather, we were eyewitnesses of his magnificence.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:19.660
For he received from God the Father honor and glory when words such as these were conveyed to him by the magnificent glory.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.660
This is my son, my beloved whom I myself have approved.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:31.160
Yes, these words we heard coming from heaven while we were with him in the holy mountain.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:38.759
So again, 32 years later, the transfiguration was as real to Peter as the day had happened.

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:42.459
But now notice what Peter next told Christians.

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:45.459
What did you write to them? Verse 19.

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:49.160
So we have the prophetic word made more sure.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:06:00.560
And you are doing well in paying attention to it as to a lamp shining in a dark place until day dawns and a day star rises in your hearts.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.060
So the transfiguration was a prophetic event.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.060
And after remembering that event, what did Peter write?

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.860
That is Christians we need to pay attention to the prophetic word.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:19.759
Now that brings us to our second point how Bible prophecy and the transfiguration should affect all of us.

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:27.459
The transfiguration should strengthen our faith that Jesus is God's son and the promised Messiah.

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:32.759
It should fortify our belief in Jesus' resurrection to spirit life in heaven.

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:40.459
This amazing vision should increase our faith in God's government because of the preview of Christ's glory and kingdom power.

00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:47.959
And the transfiguration also should emphasize to us the reliability of God's prophetic word.

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:53.459
But how do we pay attention to the prophetic word as Peter wrote?

00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:55.860
Well, one way is by Bible study and meditation.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.560
We need to study Bible prophecy.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.459
We need to meditate on fulfilled prophecy.

00:07:00.459 --> 00:07:05.459
The prophecy is being fulfilled today and those future prophecies.

00:07:05.459 --> 00:07:11.959
If the prophetic word is to be a lamp shining in a dark place that is in our figurative hearts,

00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:15.560
then we have to allow Bible prophecy to affect us deeply.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:21.759
Our desires, emotions, motivations, our goals, our decisions.

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:29.560
The anointed, such a good example in paying attention to the prophetic word in that way as they await their heavenly reward.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:35.660
But what are the benefits of paying attention to the prophetic word for those of us with an earthly hope?

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:44.759
Well, the prophetic word itself gives us insight into the benefits associated with things that will see fulfilled with our own eyes.

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:54.259
For instance, in God's new world, vicious or fierce humans, not even wild animals will cause any harm or any ruin.

00:07:54.259 --> 00:07:56.259
Isaiah 119.

00:07:56.259 --> 00:08:03.160
The meek will possess the earth and they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.560
Psalm 3711.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.660
No more long lines for food, no more people starving.

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:15.160
For there will be an abundance of grain on the earth, on the top of the mountains it will overflow.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.759
Psalm 7216.

00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:20.560
Sickness will be gone, pandemics will be gone.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:25.560
No longer will tears of sorrow be shed and even death will be no more.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:29.459
Isaiah 3324 and Revelation 214.

00:08:29.459 --> 00:08:37.059
Can you imagine no more doctors, no more medicine, no more hospitals, and no more funerals?

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:42.460
Why even the grave will be emptied when deaths give way to resurrections?

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.059
John 528 and 29.

00:08:45.059 --> 00:08:49.460
Those of us with an earthly hope, we long for life in that new world, don't we?

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:53.460
We can imagine ourselves there seeing those prophecies fulfilled,

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:59.659
and we will be there if we keep paying attention to the prophetic word.

00:08:59.659 --> 00:09:01.559
Well, what have we considered?

00:09:01.659 --> 00:09:08.759
We examine the positive and face strengthening impact the transfiguration had on Jesus and the three apostles.

00:09:08.759 --> 00:09:13.960
And we considered how Bible prophecy and the transfiguration should affect each one of us,

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:18.259
the benefits from paying attention to the prophetic word.

00:09:18.259 --> 00:09:22.259
Just think where we would be without God's prophetic word,

00:09:22.259 --> 00:09:25.159
not knowing why conditions continue to get worse,

00:09:25.159 --> 00:09:30.059
not knowing what to do or where to go, not knowing what the future holds,

00:09:30.059 --> 00:09:36.059
how loving of our Heavenly Father to provide us an understanding of His prophetic word.

00:09:36.059 --> 00:09:40.259
The Watchtower once stated this about Bible prophecy.

00:09:40.259 --> 00:09:43.860
As a lamp, it's always before us.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:48.659
We can take hold of it, and it helps us see the road to take.

00:09:48.659 --> 00:09:54.960
And it burns brighter as the evil conditions of this world grow darker.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.759
May all of us continue to appreciate how Bible prophecy and the transfiguration

00:09:59.759 --> 00:10:01.659
affect each one of us.
