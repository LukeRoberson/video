00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:10.250
Over 2,700 years ago, Jehovah God inspired the faithful man, Isaiah, to utter a prophecy

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.769
that you and I are seeing fulfilled before our eyes.

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:17.530
It's found in Isaiah chapter 60.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:23.420
I invite you to turn there with me.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:31.809
Isaiah 60, and let's read together verse 22.

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:38.329
That verse says, the little one will become a thousand, and the small one, a mighty nation,

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:49.420
I myself Jehovah will speed it up in its own time, like passengers in a car that is increasing

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.420
in speed.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:01:04.599
Do you sense the momentum of what Jehovah's organization is doing today?

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:10.680
Jehovah is accomplishing a tremendous work worldwide and all in connection with the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.680
kingdom preaching work.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.640
And in the face of satanic attack and the wickedness of the last days, what Jehovah

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.390
is accomplishing truly glorifies His name.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.950
But because so much work is being done, there is a need for more workers to keep up with

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:29.950
this work.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.150
And in this talk, we're specifically going to talk about the needs at Bethel and in theocratic

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.950
construction.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.269
Well, what is the need?

00:01:40.269 --> 00:01:46.750
In Bethel, we have a constant need for spiritually qualified men and women who can help carry

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.189
the load of the ever-increasing and complex work.

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:57.390
And there is a particular need for young brothers who can apply to come to Bethel and be trained

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.909
and in time qualified to serve as overseers or to take the lead in departments such as

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.590
the service department or public information department, hospital information department

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.710
and many others.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:17.270
We need brothers who can, in time, qualify to serve on branch committees.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.990
And even in branches where the Bethel family is small, we need young brothers to apply.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.509
Because the brothers and sisters who have been carrying the load for years, we love them,

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:29.590
but they're getting older.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.629
And they have a zeal for the work, but they recognize the need to train others so

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:38.229
that Jehovah's work can continue.

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:41.590
And what about theocratic construction?

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.469
Well, there too, there continues to be a need for spiritually qualified men and women

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:51.830
who can help carry the tremendous amount of work that is taking place on facility construction

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.509
worldwide.

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:59.069
And there too, we need spiritually qualified men who can be trained in time to take the

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:05.789
lead as trade overseers to serve as construction committee members and care for other assignments.

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:10.349
And how much work is there to do in theocratic construction?

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:15.349
Just to give you a glimpse, consider some of the needs for kingdom halls in a few countries

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.150
in Africa.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.830
Congo reports a deficit of nearly 1900 new kingdom halls.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.229
Zambia reports a need for over 900 new kingdom halls.

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:34.710
Mozambique and Angola each have a need for almost 500 kingdom halls.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.870
And in Nigeria, they have on their books a need for 2,000 renovations of kingdom halls

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.389
in addition to the new ones that they need.

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:47.469
And that's not to mention all the work taking place, and major branch construction, the

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:53.270
construction of remote translation offices, school facilities, Zambia halls, and more.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.870
Is there a need?

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.310
Absolutely.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.629
Young ones, especially you young ones in your teens, thinking about how you will use your

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:09.189
life, can you get involved in the Bethel work and theocratic construction work?

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:11.150
Should you?

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.229
If you do, what will your life be like?

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:17.829
Would you live to regret it?

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.870
Or is it possible that it would lead to a most fulfilling life in this system of things?

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.629
Well, to help answer those questions, we invite you to watch the following video, which

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:34.350
highlights comments from ones who, when they were young, made the decision to get involved

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.069
in Bethel work or theocratic construction work.

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:43.870
Watching this video could be like looking at your life in fast-forward.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.670
If you choose the course that these ones chose, how would that turn out for you?

00:04:49.670 --> 00:05:07.069
Let's watch.

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:08.389
My name is Pavel.

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.189
I serve at the Finland branch.

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:12.310
My name is Brad Berkwin.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.829
I'm serving in the Congo.

00:05:14.829 --> 00:05:16.629
My name is Gina Slay.

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:21.629
My name is Christopher Slay, and we serve in the Nigeria branch.

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:23.149
My name is Karen Ferro.

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:24.629
I live in Argentina.

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:28.269
I grew up in a sign language congregation because I have deaf parents.

00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:32.430
And when I saw the sign language department for the first time, I was so impressed by it.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.990
And so I developed my first love for Bethel's service.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.149
As a young man, there's a lot of discussions with my father.

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:46.550
He wanted really what amounted to a normal life in this system.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.589
I think the contrast for me was the joy of being a fellow worker with Jehovah in the

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:56.310
preaching work and just to feel that close friendship with him.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.990
I drifted from my goal in serving Jehovah because I didn't have friends in the congregation.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.069
I only had friends in school.

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:06.470
I said, Jehovah, I want to start serving you.

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:09.350
I want to give you my all, but tell me how.

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.189
Give me a kick.

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:14.910
The first step I took to be able to serve was when I was 18.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.550
I filled out a form to make myself available.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.029
There was a construction project in my circuit.

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:24.269
So with my older sister and two friends, we started to work there.

00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:27.949
It was relatively near us, so we supported the whole project.

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:32.509
I would say getting closer to happy pioneers.

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:34.829
I realized I was in the truth.

00:06:34.829 --> 00:06:37.389
They were in the truth, but they're happier than me.

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:41.790
So I started regular auxiliary pioneering, then regular pioneering.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.709
In our congregation, there was a special pioneer couple.

00:06:44.709 --> 00:06:48.949
Before that, they served at Bethel and therefore they had a lot of experience.

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:51.629
I asked them questions, so I want to serve in Bethel.

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:52.750
What do I need to do?

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.480
Tell me.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:00.959
When I thought of Bethel, I knew single sisters were serving there.

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:04.680
When I became aware of the construction work,

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.240
I made myself available to increase my service.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:15.000
Serving Jehovah as full as you can is not a matter of just drudgery

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.160
and sacrifices in this system.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.720
It's actually the best way of life we can live right now.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:28.000
Taste and see that Jehovah is good, that will not fail.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.519
Be constantly active in serving Jehovah.

00:07:31.519 --> 00:07:35.600
Sometimes it may seem that it's not much fun.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.680
Perhaps it may seem boring.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:43.399
But actually, serving Jehovah brings so much joy in many blessings.

00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:49.120
At Genesis 48.15, they're at refers to Jehovah as being the true God

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.800
who has been shepherding me during all my life until this day.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.680
Jacob realized that Jehovah had taken him to a spiritual place

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.839
that he would never have been able to go to on his own.

00:08:00.839 --> 00:08:18.730
And I feel that Jehovah has done that with me.

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.569
Well, these friends are serving all over the globe, aren't they?

00:08:21.569 --> 00:08:25.370
Some in their home branch territories, others in foreign assignments.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.209
But how did they describe their life?

00:08:28.209 --> 00:08:31.370
Was it drudgery and sacrifice and regret?

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:35.090
No, each one of them in one way or another said,

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:38.409
it is the best way of life that they could live.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:40.330
And didn't you love what Karen said?

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.450
Jehovah can take you to a spiritual place

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:45.970
that you could never get to on your own.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:51.250
Why do these ones find so much joy in their service?

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:55.330
Well, one reason is because they know they are filling a clear need

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.169
in Jehovah's work.

00:08:57.169 --> 00:09:00.809
And in this way, they're working shoulder-to-shoulder with God and Christ

00:09:00.809 --> 00:09:03.169
in a work that is important to them.

00:09:03.169 --> 00:09:07.090
And that brings meaning to their life.

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:09.809
A second reason why they find so much joy

00:09:09.809 --> 00:09:12.250
is highlighted for us in the book of Psalms.

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:18.259
I invite you to turn with me, please, to Psalm 145.

00:09:18.259 --> 00:09:25.179
And let's read together Psalm 145 in verse two.

00:09:25.179 --> 00:09:30.340
That verse says, all day long, I will praise you.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:34.500
I will praise your name forever and ever.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.220
In Bethel and theocratic construction assignments,

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:42.059
you have the opportunity to serve Jehovah all day, every day,

00:09:42.059 --> 00:09:45.580
to praise Jehovah, to glorify him with all your strength.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.620
So all day of every day of your life,

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.139
you are engaged in theocratic activities.

00:09:50.139 --> 00:09:54.580
And that brings contentment and joy as well.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.379
And did you notice how each one of them got started?

00:09:57.379 --> 00:10:00.379
In many cases, it was someone else in the congregation

00:10:00.379 --> 00:10:02.019
or in the circuit that encouraged them

00:10:02.019 --> 00:10:05.419
to get involved in local projects, to turn in their application,

00:10:05.419 --> 00:10:09.980
and then their journey just continued from there.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.220
We young brothers and sisters, we want you

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.259
to be able to get involved in this exciting work

00:10:15.259 --> 00:10:17.860
as early as possible.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:23.009
And so I have an exciting announcement to read.

00:10:23.009 --> 00:10:25.529
It reads this way.

00:10:25.529 --> 00:10:28.009
We are pleased to inform you that the governing body

00:10:28.009 --> 00:10:31.330
has decided to reduce the minimum age requirement

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.850
to enter Bethel service or to assist

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:58.340
with theocratic construction projects from 19 to 18 years of age.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:02.779
It goes on, this adjustment is effective immediately.

00:11:02.779 --> 00:11:04.419
Why the change?

00:11:04.419 --> 00:11:08.059
Here are three reasons based on Bible principles.

00:11:08.059 --> 00:11:11.220
Reason number one, Jehovah is blessing

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.019
his people with growth.

00:11:14.019 --> 00:11:17.820
Paul stated in Colossians 1, 6, that the good news

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.539
is bearing fruit and increasing in all the world.

00:11:21.539 --> 00:11:24.940
So it is also doing among you.

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.779
Today, we are thrilled to see how the good news

00:11:27.779 --> 00:11:32.740
continues to bear fruit and how much growth is taking place.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:36.700
We also see Jehovah's spirit at work in you young ones.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.139
And we want to open up to you the opportunity

00:11:39.139 --> 00:11:44.940
to enter special forms of service as soon as possible.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.700
Reason number two, our current and future needs

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.980
require more young brothers to make themselves available

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.539
for expanded theocratic service.

00:11:54.539 --> 00:11:56.019
Why?

00:11:56.019 --> 00:11:59.460
Proverbs 2029 says that the glory of young men

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.620
is their strength.

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.740
There is a regular need for your help

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.740
to handle important assignments.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:10.419
And reason number three, we want you to benefit as soon

00:12:10.419 --> 00:12:14.259
as possible from additional theocratic training.

00:12:14.259 --> 00:12:17.659
Paul said in Philippians 3.8, what is more,

00:12:17.659 --> 00:12:21.019
I do indeed also consider all things to be lost

00:12:21.019 --> 00:12:23.419
on account of the excelling value

00:12:23.419 --> 00:12:27.100
of the knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.419
Our heartfelt desire is for as many of you young ones

00:12:30.419 --> 00:12:34.340
as possible to experience the unique and special training

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:37.179
of excelling value that is available at Bethel

00:12:37.179 --> 00:12:39.980
and on theocratic construction projects.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.620
It will accelerate your training

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.779
in developing spiritual qualities,

00:12:43.779 --> 00:12:47.379
equip you to handle more responsibility in the congregation

00:12:47.379 --> 00:12:51.580
and to address needs at Bethel and in the field.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.980
So young ones, we encourage you to prayerfully consider

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.179
whether you can make yourself available

00:12:57.179 --> 00:13:00.860
to enjoy the special privilege of service.

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.139
And isn't that exciting?

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:19.309
So truly, young ones, we encourage you to take advantage

00:13:19.309 --> 00:13:23.309
of this opportunity, glorified Jehovah by getting involved

00:13:23.309 --> 00:13:26.029
in Bethel work and theocratic construction

00:13:26.029 --> 00:13:30.029
as soon as possible.

00:13:30.029 --> 00:13:33.190
Some of you, especially you sisters, might have noticed

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:36.269
that some of our comments were weighted more toward encouraging

00:13:36.269 --> 00:13:38.190
the young brothers to apply.

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:40.549
And the reason for that is because of the need

00:13:40.549 --> 00:13:42.909
we have for these brothers to take the lead

00:13:42.909 --> 00:13:46.509
and direct the work as they grow and receive training.

00:13:46.509 --> 00:13:50.990
But we would be a miss if we did not acknowledge the hard work

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:55.149
and self-sacrifice of the young sisters in the organization.

00:13:55.149 --> 00:13:56.909
The fact is, you're doing it.

00:13:56.909 --> 00:13:59.110
You're there, you are with us at Bethel,

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:01.389
you are fully involved in theocratic construction

00:14:01.389 --> 00:14:02.669
around the world, many of you,

00:14:02.669 --> 00:14:05.389
courageously accepting foreign assignments.

00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:08.509
And we truly love you for your example

00:14:08.549 --> 00:14:26.169
and your life of self-sacrifice.

00:14:26.169 --> 00:14:27.889
And now a word to the parents.

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:32.090
We know that you parents, you love your children

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:35.250
and you want the very best future possible

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:36.850
for your young ones.

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:40.850
And so we encourage you set goals of full-time service

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:43.049
in front of your children and help them

00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:44.970
to achieve these goals.

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:47.889
And will you miss them if they should be called to Bethel

00:14:47.889 --> 00:14:51.149
or they go off on a kingdom hall assignment somewhere?

00:14:51.149 --> 00:14:52.690
Of course you will.

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:56.570
But don't hold them back and insist that they stay home

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:59.570
with you for fear of missing them.

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:03.970
You may be depriving them of the most fulfilling life.

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:06.809
But rather, can you be like Hannah?

00:15:06.809 --> 00:15:13.919
Turn with me please to 1 Samuel 1.

00:15:13.919 --> 00:15:18.559
1 Samuel 1.28, Jehovah blessed Hannah with his son.

00:15:18.559 --> 00:15:19.600
And what did she say?

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.360
What did she do?

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.440
1 Samuel 1.28, she says,

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:27.759
I in turn now lend him to Jehovah.

00:15:27.759 --> 00:15:31.080
For all his days he is lent to Jehovah.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.799
Can you lend your son or daughter to Jehovah?

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.039
Why do we say lend?

00:15:39.039 --> 00:15:42.000
It's because Jehovah will give them back to you.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.240
In the new world you will have an eternity

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:48.279
to spend with your family together in paradise.

00:15:48.279 --> 00:15:51.720
But right now we have a work to do.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:54.200
So we thank you for training your young ones

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:59.029
to take the lead in full time service.

00:15:59.029 --> 00:16:03.029
Now a comment to our elders and circuit overseers.

00:16:03.029 --> 00:16:05.629
What can you brothers do to help the young ones

00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:08.549
on the path to serving Jehovah full time

00:16:08.549 --> 00:16:11.269
in Bethel and in theocratic construction?

00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:13.830
Well, are you encouraging Bethel service?

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:17.029
Are you helping the young ones to learn how to get involved

00:16:17.029 --> 00:16:20.029
in local projects with their local design construction

00:16:20.029 --> 00:16:21.789
department?

00:16:21.789 --> 00:16:24.990
School counselors are charting a path for our young ones

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:26.350
in school.

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:29.669
Shouldn't we be doing the same?

00:16:29.669 --> 00:16:31.789
To illustrate the impact that you brothers can have

00:16:31.789 --> 00:16:34.350
on the lives of these young ones, a brother that

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:37.549
works with us at Warwick told us his experience.

00:16:37.549 --> 00:16:39.470
And he said when he was a teenager,

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:40.870
he wanted to go to Bethel.

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:45.110
But he hesitated because he wasn't sure if he could do it.

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:47.389
And he didn't know if there really was a need.

00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:49.710
But his circuit overseers saw his potential

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:52.870
and gave him a Bethel application and persisted

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.870
in encouraging him until he could see the need

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:57.830
and he turned in his application.

00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:59.669
Well, now he's been serving for some years.

00:16:59.669 --> 00:17:00.950
He's married now and he and his wife

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:03.870
were making a fantastic contribution.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:06.750
But are there ones like that in your congregation,

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:08.869
in your circuit that may be just on the fence

00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:12.029
and would benefit from some encouragement?

00:17:12.029 --> 00:17:15.589
You can truly make a difference in how these young ones

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:19.180
use their lives.

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:21.940
And finally a comment to the current generation

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:25.180
who is carrying the load of oversight and Bethel

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.779
and in theocratic construction.

00:17:27.779 --> 00:17:31.180
We thank you for your years of service

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.299
and to contemplate what Jehovah has been able to accomplish

00:17:34.299 --> 00:17:37.700
with your help is just fantastic.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:41.259
And now we thank you for training the next generation

00:17:41.259 --> 00:17:43.900
so that the work can continue and Jehovah

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.220
can continue to get his work done.

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.819
Now we know that you desire to continue in the work.

00:17:48.819 --> 00:17:52.059
You have a zeal for the work and to feel productive

00:17:52.059 --> 00:17:54.500
and have accomplishment and feel valued.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:57.380
Well, that's very much connected to our joy.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.299
We understand that.

00:17:58.299 --> 00:18:01.980
But as we get older, we know that there is a need

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:05.700
to train the next generation so Jehovah's work can continue.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:09.819
And we know that you love Jehovah more than you do

00:18:09.819 --> 00:18:12.900
your personal privileges.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.460
And truly, we still want you involved.

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:19.180
The young ones need your experience and your advice.

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:23.019
And young ones are wise to recognize how much they can benefit

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:25.019
from your wisdom.

00:18:25.019 --> 00:18:27.940
But we thank you for being ready to hand the job

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:34.220
to these ones and then help them to succeed.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:37.019
Well, to conclude, we'd like to just mention one more prophecy

00:18:37.019 --> 00:18:39.660
that we are seeing fulfilled before our eyes.

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.940
In this case, it's in the book of Psalms.

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:49.000
And we invite you to turn to the 110th Psalm.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.799
Psalm 110 in verse three says this,

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:55.640
Your people will offer themselves willingly

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.279
on the day of your military force.

00:18:58.279 --> 00:19:02.839
You have your company of young men just like do jobs.

00:19:02.839 --> 00:19:06.319
Well, as we've discussed, Jehovah is speeding up the work.

00:19:06.319 --> 00:19:10.119
And so therefore, there is a need for more workers.

00:19:10.119 --> 00:19:13.279
Jehovah is willing to train you and entrust you.

00:19:13.279 --> 00:19:15.839
And Jehovah's organization is making arrangements

00:19:15.839 --> 00:19:19.359
for you to get involved as early as possible.

00:19:19.359 --> 00:19:23.720
Well, this verse reassures us that you young ones will respond.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.680
In fact, you are responding.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.480
This verse is being fulfilled.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:32.759
May you personally share in the fulfillment of this verse

00:19:32.759 --> 00:19:35.920
by taking advantage of opportunities to glorify

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.480
Jehovah in Bethel and in theocratic construction.
