Who are Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:15.880
We come from hundreds of ethnic and language backgrounds, yet we share common beliefs and goals.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.879
We worship Jehovah, the God of the Bible, and the Creator of all things.

00:00:21.879 --> 00:00:27.879
We are Christians, so we follow the teachings and example of Christ Jesus.

00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:34.880
Like Jesus, we strive to be honest, peaceful, law-rebiting citizens of the land where we live.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:42.880
Even more important, we all follow Jesus' example by regularly spending time,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.880
helping people learn about the Bible and God's Kingdom.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:54.880
Because we witness or talk about Jehovah God in His Kingdom, we are known as Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.880
Each week, we meet together at Kingdom Halls to learn about God in His Word, the Bible.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.880
Our meetings are free and open to the public.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.879
We welcome you to visit us.

00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:12.879
