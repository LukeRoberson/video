00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:29.800
Why should I fear the line?

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.000
Why should I fear any foe?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.859
With Jehovah by my side,

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:43.299
I will not run and hide.

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:49.299
My God is with me this, I know.

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:56.179
With eyes of faith, I see beyond the darkness.

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:03.380
With eyes of faith, there's nothing more to fear.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.260
With Jehovah I am strong,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.019
Determined to go home,

00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:48.829
Being that my God is always me.

00:01:48.829 --> 00:02:36.400
Future is assured, they'll stand it.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:03:25.139
With I Jehovah claims his victory.
