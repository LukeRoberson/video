00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:19.199
Ecaloid is the capital city of Nunavut and it's one of the most northern cities in Canada.

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.600
The winter months are long, dark and cold.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.039
It's a small population only about 7,000 people.

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:33.000
It's a beautiful place, but also a challenging place to live, to work and to raise a family.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.719
Because of these factors, it wasn't until many decades after the truth had spread through

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.159
most of southern Canada that it finally reached Ecaloid.

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:47.600
Over the years, small groups of publishers would travel to Ecaloid and the area on preaching

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.600
campaigns.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.600
However, the challenge was that there was no group or congregation in the province,

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.880
so it was very hard for interested ones to make progress.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.799
Bill and Ena Lidstone were among the first people in Ecaloid to hear the truth.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.680
Well, I grew up as an alien and I used to go to church to my grandmother on Sundays.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.879
We were taught about heaven and hell, and that was scary because if you dissipate it,

00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:19.359
you're going to hell, and I don't want to be dissipated.

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:24.280
Bill was from the island of Newfoundland and he heard the truth when he was young.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.799
However, before he had an opportunity to study the Bible, he moved away to Ecaloid in 1978.

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:37.799
What had learned initially about the truth stuck with me, and I knew I was, you know, about

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.640
2,000 kilometers from any congregation or any witnesses, so I remember praying to Jehovah.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.799
If there's any way that someone could help me learn more to progress, you know, can you

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:50.799
do it?

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.799
Well, little did Bill know that a brother by the name of Greg Kittle had come to Ecaloid

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:57.799
for work.

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.799
However, he was just going to be there a few weeks.

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.680
He was a knock at the door one evening, answered the door, and there's a man standing there

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.599
wearing a shirt and tie, which was really unusual, and he started his presentation, and I

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.599
didn't let him finish.

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.039
I said, are you one of Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:15.680
He was probably almost as surprised as I was.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.520
He told me later that he had also been praying to find someone, and that was the first

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.319
night that he started going door to door.

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:27.800
Someone was guiding him.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:34.840
I have never heard Jehovah's name, so actually knowing about Jesus' heads of father, Jehovah,

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.639
and he's a hero of our prayers.

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:40.520
It's already good to me.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.120
Well finally, after several courageous families made the decision and the sacrifice to move

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.800
to the area, a group was formed in 2008, and two years later, a congregation was formed.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.919
We were just amazed to see that there were still places in our own country that had a need.

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:03.520
Proverbs 11 and 14 says you'll find success through many advisors.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.520
We tried to apply that.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.800
We wrote the branch to find out more about the needs.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.560
We talked to the elders up there and some of the brothers and sisters that are already

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.400
in the lift in a calivate, and they were so helpful in helping us to prepare for how

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.039
to make a big move like that.

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:21.479
Even though we are arriving to an isolated place, we felt the warmth of the brothers and sisters

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:23.000
right away.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.919
When we got off the plane and entered the airport, the entire group of brothers and sisters

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:33.960
was there waiting for us, and they offered us practical support, too, as we set up a new

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.719
life there.

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:41.639
Well, another concern we had was the extreme cold and the dark winters.

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:48.439
In fact, it was those cold, dark nights where we saw the most brilliant northern lights

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:54.319
and starry skies, and on blizzard days, it was such a great opportunity to associate

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:59.159
and get together with the congregation, so those were the things that got us through.

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.960
I remember going out in service for the very first time, and actually the first door that

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.960
I knocked on, a man came and said that he had just been praying, asking God to send

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.280
him someone to help him understand the Bible, and he invited us in.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.040
So we knew right away that the ministry was going to be a real source of joy for us.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:25.040
In 2022, the first Kingdom Hall was built in the city of Ecaloate.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.439
Over the years, they've met in school, gymnasiums and hotels, but now Jehovah has blessed their

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:36.319
hard work with a Kingdom Hall that brings so much praise to his name, and it's all because

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:42.870
these ones made themselves available for so long.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.670
It has taught me that Jehovah is a hero prayer, and if he hears someone praying for help,

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.550
he will sense someone even if you live far away.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.470
Well Jesus told us that this message would reach all parts of the earth.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.470
This tells us that Jehovah loves all people, and when the time was right, Jehovah ensured

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.230
that his people reached the Canadian North.
