00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:08.060
When I was young, one of my favorite desserts was my mother's sweet potato pie.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.300
It always tasted the same.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.939
To me, it was perfect every time.

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:22.219
I'd often ask her, Ma, what do you put in here to make it taste so good?

00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:28.140
She'd always respond, I just use the same stuff every time.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.420
In other words, number one, she wasn't going to tell me.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:37.020
And two, she had a recipe that worked, so she never changed it.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:46.140
Well, the Bible is like a cookbook, full of recipes that work, that can make our life

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.100
spiritually successful.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.619
Please note how Paul explains the benefits of these recipes at 2 Timothy, chapter 3,

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:59.179
16 and 17.

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:03.899
All scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.500
reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining and righteousness,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.260
so that the man of God may be fully competent,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.379
completely equipped for every good work.

00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:25.980
Sometimes the recipe from God's inspired word comes in a form of a Bible example,

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:33.420
as we study that example, we extract qualities and attitudes that we can imitate.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.900
Other times, there's a list of qualities, such as the various aspects of the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.819
fruitage of God's Spirit, mentioned in Galatians chapter 5,

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:49.099
or the list of positive things to consider at Philippians 4, 8 and 9.

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:54.859
And of course, there are numerous Bible principles that we can use

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:57.900
to help us make good decisions.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:05.099
Meditating on and applying these principles, qualities and examples

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:10.300
can be a recipe that contributes to spiritual success.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.620
Let's consider one example.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.419
It's recorded in 1 Peter chapter 3 and verse 8.

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:20.860
Take note of the ingredients.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.620
All of you have unity of mind,

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.460
fellow feeling, brotherly affection, tender compassion,

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.979
and humility. This is a recipe of five

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:40.460
beautiful qualities that contribute to our spiritual success.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:49.259
How so? Let's discuss the ingredients. Peter first mentions unity of mind.

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:54.379
The footnote says, think in agreement.

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.060
So we must think in agreement with one another,

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.539
but especially with Jehovah and his organization.

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:08.060
In what way? The latter part of Isaiah 30, 15 says,

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.419
your strength will be in keeping calm and showing trust.

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:17.259
That's exactly what the faithful slave has done.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.620
So let us have unity of mind with them and have the same

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:30.780
calmness and confidence in Jehovah as we face personal challenges in our life.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.539
In 2 Kings chapter 4, a shoot of my woman is mentioned

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:40.460
who had confidence in the prophet Elisha.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:46.300
She suffered a terrible tragedy in her life, yet she remained calm

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:51.020
and showed trust in the man of the true God Elisha.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.620
Her example of trust in Jehovah's representative

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.419
is worthy of invitation. In fact, there is an expression

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:03.900
she uses in chapter 4 that conveys the level of trust

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.500
we want to have in Jehovah and his earthly representatives today.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.979
Let me tell you about this woman. She and her husband lived in

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:18.459
Shunam. Elisha would regularly make encouraging

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.180
visits with them when he was in that city. Elisha

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.939
appreciated their hospitality and wanted to do something

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:30.699
kind for them. What would he do? Well,

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:35.819
verses 14 through 16 of 2 Kings chapter 4

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:38.860
indicate that she did not have a son

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.100
and her husband was old. So Elisha told her that the next

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.420
year she would be embracing a son. Well,

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:53.579
as Elisha foretold, she gave birth the next year.

00:04:53.579 --> 00:04:58.540
But unfortunately, something drastic happened.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.339
The child grew up and one day went out to work with his father.

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:07.100
In verse 19, the boy complained of a headache,

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.420
which led to his eventual death.

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:17.740
What would this woman do? This was her only son.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:23.019
Well, she had confidence in the man of the true God, Elisha.

00:05:23.019 --> 00:05:27.579
So she says to her husband, in verse 22,

00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:31.500
send me, please, one of the attendants and one of the donkeys,

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.220
and let me go quickly to the man of the true God and return.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.259
In verse 23, her husband asks,

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:44.620
why are you going to see him today? In other words,

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.980
what can he do for us? Note her response

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.300
at the end of verse 23 and verse 24.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.699
However, she said,

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:00.540
everything is all right.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.060
So she saddled the donkey and said to her attendant,

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:08.939
go quickly. Do not slow down for me unless I tell you to.

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:17.420
So this calm, trusting woman rides about 19 miles or 30 kilometers

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:23.180
and finds Elisha and he ends up resurrecting her son.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.500
Her trusting relationship and association with Elisha

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.540
had given her confidence. Although she experienced a tragedy,

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.899
she knew that everything was all right.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.540
Elisha's faith and confidence in Jehovah

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:46.220
helped this devoted woman also to remain calm and confident

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.259
when facing adversity.

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:51.899
At Isaiah 4110,

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:55.100
note Jehovah's assurance,

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.860
do not be afraid for I am with you.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.139
Do not be anxious for I am your God.

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:07.339
I will fortify you. Yes, I will help you.

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:13.180
I will really hold on to you with my right hand of righteousness.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:19.100
So let's work hard to have unity of mind with Jehovah's organization

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.339
by keeping calm and showing trust in Jehovah

00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:26.699
and being confident that with Jehovah's help,

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:30.459
everything will be all right.

00:07:30.459 --> 00:07:37.949
That's a beautiful ingredient in this recipe for spiritual success.

00:07:37.949 --> 00:07:43.470
At first Peter 3.8, Peter next mentions three more ingredients.

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.589
They are aspects of love,

00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:52.430
fellow feeling, brotherly affection, tender compassion.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:57.470
These aspects of love convey empathy.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:04.829
Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another.

00:08:04.829 --> 00:08:07.550
As this system draws to a close,

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:12.829
Satan will try to divide us from within.

00:08:12.829 --> 00:08:16.029
So love for our brothers and sisters

00:08:16.029 --> 00:08:21.230
and empathizing with one another will become ever more important.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:25.389
It will serve to unify us.

00:08:25.389 --> 00:08:29.709
Think of the empathy of Jehovah's organization.

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:32.509
We all have personal challenges,

00:08:32.509 --> 00:08:34.750
but so do our overseers,

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.909
those taking the lead in the organization here on earth.

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:43.710
Some of them have lost loved ones in death, just like us.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:48.990
Some have experienced sickness and anxiety, just like us.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:53.070
We love them for their empathy.

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:57.070
Think about the heavenly part of Jehovah's organization.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:01.389
Since Satan's rebellion, Jehovah has been disappointed,

00:09:01.389 --> 00:09:06.269
saddened, angered at the actions of imperfect men.

00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:12.669
These are real feelings that our empathetic Heavenly Father possesses.

00:09:12.669 --> 00:09:17.309
Jesus experienced similar disappointment and sadness

00:09:17.309 --> 00:09:24.590
as he also saw the rebellion of Satan, Adam, and Eve and what's resulted.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:29.309
In fact, Jesus' understanding became deeper

00:09:29.309 --> 00:09:34.429
when he became human and began to experience human emotions.

00:09:34.429 --> 00:09:38.990
The April 15, 2002 Watchtower article entitled,

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:43.230
Empathy, Key to Kindness and Compassion.

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:48.190
Mention three ways we can sharpen our sensitivity to the knees

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:50.509
and feelings of others.

00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:52.669
The first.

00:09:52.669 --> 00:09:54.509
Listen.

00:09:54.509 --> 00:10:00.029
By listening carefully, we learn what problems others face.

00:10:00.029 --> 00:10:05.230
And the better we listen, the more likely they will open up their hearts

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.509
and reveal their feelings.

00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:11.470
Second, observe.

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:15.389
Not everyone will openly tell us how they feel

00:10:15.389 --> 00:10:18.509
or what they are going through.

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:21.309
A keen observer will notice

00:10:21.309 --> 00:10:26.830
when a fellow Christian needs encouragement or some practical assistance.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:30.830
Third, use your imagination.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:36.429
The most powerful way to stimulate empathy is to ask yourself,

00:10:36.429 --> 00:10:40.429
if I were in this situation, how would I feel?

00:10:40.429 --> 00:10:42.669
How would I respond?

00:10:42.669 --> 00:10:45.870
What would I need?

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:50.750
So, fellow feeling, brotherly affection and tender compassion

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.870
are aspects of loving empathy

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.789
and our valuable ingredients to our spiritual success

00:10:57.789 --> 00:11:02.289
and will benefit others.

00:11:02.289 --> 00:11:09.090
The final quality highlighted in First Peter 3.8 is humility.

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:11.889
Why do we need humility?

00:11:11.889 --> 00:11:14.610
Because we need to trust.

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:20.529
Trust in Jehovah and His organization requires humility,

00:11:20.529 --> 00:11:24.690
not relying on our own strength or wisdom.

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:30.370
Humility helps us to cope with whatever God permits.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:33.250
When we face anxiety and pressure in our life,

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:37.330
we may yearn for immediate relief.

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.769
But humility helps us to trust

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:45.009
that Jehovah knows precisely when

00:11:45.009 --> 00:11:48.049
and how to act in our behalf.

00:11:48.049 --> 00:11:52.370
So we wait patiently.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:59.809
Jehovah always responds to our needs in His time and in His way.

00:11:59.809 --> 00:12:03.649
Humility helps us to admit that Jehovah's thoughts

00:12:03.649 --> 00:12:07.970
are vastly superior to our own.

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:11.570
We recognize our limited discernment

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:17.730
in comparison with Jehovah's all-encompassing perception.

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.850
He sees things we do not discern,

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:28.289
and thus we trust that His way of doing things is always best.

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:31.169
So, as the Great Tribulation approaches,

00:12:31.169 --> 00:12:37.889
humbly trust in Jehovah and His organization.

00:12:38.129 --> 00:12:41.090
First Peter, chapter 5,

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:44.450
and verse number 6 says this,

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:49.490
humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God,

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:54.210
so that He may exalt you in due time.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:59.649
Brothers, there is no better place to be

00:12:59.649 --> 00:13:04.529
than under the mighty hand of God.

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:08.049
Humility is a beautiful ingredient

00:13:08.049 --> 00:13:14.620
that helps us to remain there.

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:17.820
So what were the ingredients in our recipe

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:20.299
for spiritual success?

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:24.539
First was unity of mind.

00:13:24.539 --> 00:13:28.539
Be at unity with Jehovah's organization today

00:13:28.539 --> 00:13:32.460
by keeping calm and showing trust.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.220
In the words of the Shunamaid woman

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:35.820
and second Kings chapter 4,

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:40.379
when facing adversity always know that with Jehovah,

00:13:40.379 --> 00:13:43.980
everything is all right.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.860
Second was fellow feeling,

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:50.299
brotherly affection, and tender compassion,

00:13:50.299 --> 00:13:54.139
all aspects of loving empathy.

00:13:54.139 --> 00:13:58.379
Remember, we're all in this together.

00:13:58.379 --> 00:14:01.100
The celestial chariot is empathetic

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.539
toward what we face

00:14:02.539 --> 00:14:05.419
and will respond to our personal

00:14:05.419 --> 00:14:08.620
and organizational needs.

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:14.299
Finally, try always to include humility

00:14:14.299 --> 00:14:17.100
in your recipe for success.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.940
Humility requires trust.

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:24.539
So trust that Jehovah's way of doing things

00:14:24.539 --> 00:14:28.299
is always best.

00:14:28.299 --> 00:14:31.899
Psalm 119 verse 105 says,

00:14:31.899 --> 00:14:35.740
that the Bible is a lamp to my foot

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:39.740
and a light for my path.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.940
So take time to consider a portion

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:45.899
of God's word each day.

00:14:45.899 --> 00:14:48.539
As situations, decisions,
