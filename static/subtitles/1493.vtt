00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.969
Preaching in the province of Quebec was a real challenge.

00:00:05.969 --> 00:00:11.970
The Catholic Church was present in every sphere of public life.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:18.969
In the early 40s, the persecution took on quite a bit of emphasis.

00:00:18.969 --> 00:00:21.969
Many witnesses were being arrested.

00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:23.969
Any excuse was used.

00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:27.969
Peddling without a license, this was a favorite excuse.

00:00:27.969 --> 00:00:30.969
Jehovah's Witnesses were put in prison

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:34.969
whenever they were seen with religious literature.

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:40.969
It had got so bad in Quebec that it was decided to circulate a petition.

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.969
And this petition was circulated throughout Canada

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.969
and it called on the government of Quebec to put an end to this persecution.

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.969
And interestingly, some 600,000 people signed the petition.

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:04.969
The witnesses distributed a very fiery track called the Burning Hade of Quebec.

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:08.969
And in this track, they showed what was really happening.

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:14.969
The actions of the policemen, the illegal arrests, the mob action.

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:19.969
Within four months, there was 800 new court cases.

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:26.969
So here for 400 Jehovah's Witnesses, you had 1600 court cases.

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:35.969
The seriousness of the court cases increased in that now they were accusing the brothers of sedition.

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:40.969
If convicted, it was more than 10, maybe 12 or 15 years in prison.

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:46.969
We have one brother, Amy Boucher, who was arrested and charged with sedition.

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:52.969
Amy Boucher was a very poor brother, lived in a rural part of Quebec.

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:58.969
And he actually went to court with his ox and buggy.

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.969
And on the way to court, he was preaching.

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:03.969
So he was arrested again.

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:06.969
They had the court hearing and he was condemned.

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:09.969
He was found guilty of sedition.

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:12.969
And his case went up to the court of appeal.

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:16.969
And at that time, the court of appeal of Quebec was very hostile.

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:19.969
And he lost on appeal.

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:22.969
So it went up to the Supreme Court of Canada.

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:29.969
And by this time, there were several other brothers and sisters also charged on sedition.

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:37.969
Which meant that if he lost his case, we had several going to prison for very lengthy prison terms.

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:45.969
When brother Boucher's case came before the Supreme Court, he lost by a majority of one.

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:49.969
The Catholic judges all ruled against him.

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:54.969
And they found that the track, the burning hate of Quebec, was seditious.

00:02:54.969 --> 00:03:00.969
Our lawyers looked at the situation, prayed about it, and thought, what can we do?

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:02.969
We can't lose this battle.

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:10.969
And they realized that in Canada, there was a very rarely used provision of asking the Supreme Court for a rehearing.

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:17.969
At the rehearing, one of the Catholic judges was willing to discuss further the issue of sedition.

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:24.969
And to be guilty of sedition, you have to incite to violence.

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:29.969
So our attorney asked them, please, look at the record.

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:34.969
Show the court where Jehovah's Witnesses incited to violence.

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:37.969
And finally, they were able to convince the court they were wrong.

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:40.969
And so they overturned their initial decision.

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:46.969
And brother Boucher's case was victorious.

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:50.969
This dealt with all the accusations of sedition.

00:03:50.969 --> 00:04:01.969
And really brought to an end the vicious opposition, because that case was the one the government was hoping would work out for them.

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:04.969
There is one case that's quite noteworthy in Quebec.

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:15.969
And it's a case of the priests calling up the federal police to come and interrupt a meeting of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.970
and expel the speaker from the province of Quebec.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:30.970
Police obeyed the priests, they went to the meeting, they took the brother, and they escorted him out of the province into Ontario.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.970
And to disrupt a religious meeting was a criminal act.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:47.970
For the first time, and it's at the level of the Supreme Court, they found that the two policemen had to pay moral damages to the brothers for intercepting or interrupting the meeting.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.970
This has never happened before.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:56.970
And when it came up to the Supreme Court, the unanimously ruled against the province of Quebec.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.970
The section on religious freedom is the result of these court cases.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:09.970
Every lawyer in Canada, whether in Quebec or in English Canada, when he studies law must review these cases.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.970
They are the fundamentals of religious freedom.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:21.970
And they represent the different areas, police action, government action, criminal action.

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:28.970
And they lay a very nice basis for our freedoms today.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:35.970
Our purpose is to be able to preach the good news and to direct people's attention toward the Bible.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:48.970
But our court cases have helped governments, courts, judges, and officials to have the right point of view on the issue of religious freedom.
