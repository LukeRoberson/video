00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:10.669
James 4.6, God opposes the haughty ones, but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones.

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:18.469
Well, haughtiness is really disdainful pride, superciliousness, arrogance. One who is

00:00:18.469 --> 00:00:26.469
haughty is in his own estimation superior to his fellow men. On the other hand, humility

00:00:26.469 --> 00:00:34.549
is freedom from pride or arrogance. It's the state of lowliness of mind. Humility and

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:43.710
haughtiness are the exact opposites of each other. Humility is here. Haughtiness is at the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:52.789
other end of the spectrum. Which one are you? Likely neither, but somewhere in between.

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:58.590
Now if Jehovah had a humble haughty meter, where would the needle be if he was monitoring

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:06.150
you? Would it be in the middle? Well, hopefully not. Hope would be a closer to humility. We're

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.510
imperfect, but we want to be as far away from haughtiness as possible. The verse said,

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:20.870
Jehovah opposes the haughty, but he favors those who are humble. Haughtiness is not totally

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:27.870
a mental condition per se. I'll please find Mark chapter 7 with me. Mark 7 verse 21 and

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:36.989
22, Jesus put haughtiness in a lineup with many unsavory qualities and actions. Well, if

00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:43.349
it's not totally a mental condition, what is haughtiness? Notice how Jesus describes where

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:56.879
it comes from. In Mark chapter 7, 21 and 22, it says, for from inside, out of the heart

00:01:56.879 --> 00:02:02.719
of men, so it's a heart condition, come injurious reasoning, sexual immorality, thefts, murders,

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:08.919
acts of adultery, greed, acts of wickedness, deceit, brazen conduct, an imbibious eye, blasphemy,

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:17.800
haughtiness and unreasonableness. All these things come from within and defile a man. So haughtiness

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:25.460
is really a condition of the heart, the inner person. And it says, it's a wicked thing. Well,

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:32.300
what about humility? In some ancient cultures, a humble person was always thought to be a slave,

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:39.819
miserable, a pitiful person. But humility is not the same as humiliation.

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:47.659
Instead, in the Bible, it stresses that humility, the slowliness of mine can actually lead to

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:56.460
honor, to status with God. And so does it Proverbs 22, 4 says, the result of humility is riches and

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:06.699
glory and life. Not miserable, not pitiful by any means. But we said earlier that Jehovah had a

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:13.740
humble, haughty meter that the needle likely would not be pegged out on humility in our case,

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:21.819
nor on haughtiness. Well, why is that? Well, because as dedicated Christians, none of us are

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:31.099
absolutely haughty at heart. But as imperfect dedicated Christians, none of us have the market

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:38.699
on true humility. Only Jehovah and Jesus were absolutely humble. Well, can we be basically

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:46.139
a humble person, and yet act haughtily or arrogant at times? Well, let's consider Moses.

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:53.500
Jehovah gave him tremendous authority, and it's known that power, authority, responsible position

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:03.020
can erode humility. But Moses proved his humility time after time. For example, in Numbers chapter 11,

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:09.020
he gathered together 70 elders, and verse 25 says that Jehovah took some of the spirit of Moses

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:15.340
away and put it on the 70 elders, and they began to behave as prophets. Well, there's nothing that

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.980
indicates Moses gelously tried to guard his authority and privileges. He was humble.

00:04:23.019 --> 00:04:29.339
And we all remember the account where Moses' father-in-law suggested that he delegate some of

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:37.500
his workload to others. Moses did not ericently resist that. He humbly accepted the suggestion.

00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:42.860
And then later at the end of his life, when Jehovah chose his replacement Joshua,

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:48.139
Moses humbly accepted that decision. He urged the people to follow Joshua's lead.

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:56.279
Well, we could say nothing else than Moses was an excellent example of humility.

00:04:57.959 --> 00:05:06.889
But he was not perfect. Please find with me Numbers chapter 20. Numbers 20, humble Moses allowed

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:13.529
himself to be provoked and perform an act of haughtiness or arrogance. The situation was that there

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:20.250
was no water for the assembly of Israel, and the people began to show arrogant, rebellious spirit.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:29.290
Please pick up the dialogue with me in verse 4 of Numbers chapter 20. They said,

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.930
Why have you brought Jehovah's congregation into this wilderness for us in our livestock to die here?

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.129
And why have you let us up out of Egypt to bring us to this evil place? It's no place for seed and

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:45.529
figs and vines and pomegranates, and there's no water to drink. Well, they got under Moses' skin.

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:55.480
They caused him to lose his humility momentarily. Look at verse 9. So Moses took the rod from

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.439
before Jehovah just to see it commanded him. Then Moses and Aaron called the congregation together

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:08.199
before the Craig, and he said to them, Here now you rebels must we, meaning Aaron and I, bring out

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:15.800
water for you from this Craig? Well, that was a haughty, arrogant act. Admittedly, the people

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:22.839
were out of line with their speech and attitude, but Jehovah took note of the spike in the needle

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:31.639
of the haughty meter. Look at verse 12. Jehovah later said to Moses and Aaron, because you did not

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:37.079
show faith in me and sanctify me before the eyes of the people of Israel, you will not bring this

00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:44.519
congregation into the land that I will give them. So though generally Moses' needle was always

00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:52.759
very close to humility, Jehovah was displeased with this spike on the needle toward haughtiness

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:58.519
even though momentary. Well, it's good for us to consider this because it's easy for us to lose

00:06:58.519 --> 00:07:05.879
our humility, particularly if we are invested with some authority. Maybe we have a new responsibility

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:10.920
in the congregation on the circuit at the branch, or maybe we have a skill and talent that we

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:18.120
excel in and we get compliments galore, or we're at odds with a fellow believer. Well, we maintain our

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:25.560
humility. There was a great line in the February 2013 watchtower that said, remember, in order to be

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:35.240
useful to Jehovah, our humility should always exceed our ability. King Saul, he allowed his ability

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:43.480
to exceed his humility. In 1 Samuel 1517, he was to not take any spoils from the land, but he allowed

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:51.079
that to happen. And in that verse 17, Samuel confronted him and he said, were you not insignificant or

00:07:51.079 --> 00:07:56.600
humble in your own eyes? And then he says, why did you disobey Jehovah? Well, Saul stammered and

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:02.680
stuttered, but bottom line, Jehovah's not pleased because in verse 23, Jehovah said through Samuel

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:08.279
rebelliousness is the same as a synod divination, pushing ahead presumptuously the same as magical

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:16.759
power and adultery. You rejected the word of God, I reject you as King. Well, just as our text

00:08:16.759 --> 00:08:35.320
said, Jehovah, opposes the haughty ones, may we all strive to keep our needle close to humility.
