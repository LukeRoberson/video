00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.650
Imagine being able to take a tour through time from the earliest days of Christianity

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:13.529
to the present, seeing for yourself how Christians through the centuries endure their

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:19.809
darkest hours of persecution, and how the worldwide activity of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:00:19.809 --> 00:00:24.390
got its start in modern times.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.469
That's what visitors can expect at an exhibit that opened in October 2012 at the World

00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:34.109
Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses in Brooklyn, New York.

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:39.950
Through a self-guided tour, this exhibit, entitled A People for Jehovah's Name, lets you

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.909
explore hundreds of documents, photos, and other artifacts from around the world, following

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:50.630
the dramatic history of Jehovah's People through the years.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.869
The exhibit is divided into four sections.

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:59.990
The first one, men have loved the darkness, sets the stage, taking you through the centuries

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.950
after Jesus' ministry, giving you sobering reminders of what those who tried to follow

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.560
in Jesus' footsteps had to face.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.959
The next section, Let the Light Shine, transports you to the late 1800s and early 1900s in

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:20.560
the days before World War I.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.640
It tells the story of sincere people who began studying the scriptures and living by the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.879
Bible truths they found.

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:33.519
One of the historical treasures featured in this part of the exhibit is the famous multimedia

00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:39.060
production known as the Photo Drama of Creation.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.819
When it originally debuted about a hundred years ago, the Photo Drama was an eight-hour

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:48.459
color slide and motion picture production that was shown to millions of people all over

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:52.069
the world.

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:57.390
At the exhibit, you can browse over 500 of the original color slides used in the production

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.670
along with other artwork.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:13.659
You can even see excerpts from the program's introduction.

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:18.860
Next, step into a section called the Dragon Guru Rathful, where you come face-to-face

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.180
with artifacts from the two world wars, and learn about the persecution suffered by

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.460
Christ's followers during the early 20th century.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.939
Those let you hear and see the stories of those who remained neutral during those difficult

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:40.580
years of war.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.460
The last section of the exhibit, Good News for All Nations, uses a giant picture collage

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.020
made up of hundreds of vintage photos to tell the story of the growth, preaching work,

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.099
and brotherly love that are the hallmarks of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.539
This one-of-a-kind exhibit is designed to help all of Jehovah's Witnesses better understand

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:07.740
their own heritage and gain a better appreciation of the struggles that Christian men and women

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.259
have faced throughout history to truly walk in the footsteps of Jesus Christ.
