00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.919
is the following statement, true or false?

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:09.039
Truth is relative.

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:13.560
That statement is not relatively but absolutely false.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.039
Something is truth for one person,

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.399
but not truth for another person.

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:25.600
Many religious organizations claim to have the truth, however.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.280
Between them, there are many contradicting teachings.

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:35.159
Is this just another evidence that all truth is relative?

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:38.079
That there is no absolute truth?

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.520
No. The truth is that truth is not relative.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.600
It is absolute.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:51.679
Those who say truth is relative are not only relatively but absolutely wrong.

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:55.039
The Hebrew word for truth, a myth,

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:04.799
is often rendered truth and may designate what is firm, trustworthy, stable, or faithful.

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.439
The Greek word for truth, a Latia,

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:12.280
originates with the word meaning not concealed.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:19.359
So the truth often involves the revealing of that which was formerly hidden.

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:24.879
Jesus said according to Luke 12 verse 2,

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.480
but there is nothing carefully concealed that will not be revealed

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.840
and nothing secret that will not become known.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.480
There are over 70 places in the Gospel accounts

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.040
where Jesus is said to have used the unique expression

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.159
to emphasize the truthfulness of his words.

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:51.280
He would often say amen to introduce a sentence.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.760
The corresponding Hebrew word meant certain true.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.439
Lost the new international dictionary of New Testament theology, quote,

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.840
by introducing his words with amen,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.879
Jesus labeled them as certain and reliable.

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:16.719
He stood by them and made them binding on himself and his hearers.

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:21.159
The new international dictionary of New Testament theology,

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:26.520
volume 3, page 901 says, quote,

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.520
many people try to unmask everything in the belief that no one and nothing

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.000
can genuinely lay claim to truth.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.199
Truth can indeed be found.

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:45.800
We need to display a humble submission to truth whenever and wherever it emerges.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.840
Such openness to truth is required of those who worship the God of truth.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.680
Reference for truth ensures honesty in a man's dealings with his neighbor,

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.800
both in word and deed.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:08.039
This is the attitude to which both the Old Testament and the New Testament bear witness.

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:10.840
End of quote.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.000
Does the truth ever change?

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:21.719
That question was raised by the R. Ruggiero in his book, The Art of Thinking.

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:26.319
His answer is no, to quote him.

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:34.360
It may sometimes seem to that it changes, but on closer inspection it will be found not to.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.639
Yes, the truth never changes.

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:44.520
Consider, he says, the case of the authorship of the first book of the Bible,

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.439
the book of Genesis.

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:52.719
For centuries, Christians and Jews alike believed that the book had a single author.

00:03:52.719 --> 00:04:03.960
In time, this view was challenged and eventually replaced by the belief that as many as five authors contributed to Genesis.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.080
Then, in 1981, the results of a five-year linguistic analysis of Genesis were published,

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:21.639
stating that there is an 82% probability of single authorship as originally thought.

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.759
Has the truth about the authorship of Genesis changed?

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:30.079
No, only our belief has changed.

00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:32.680
End of quote.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:39.800
He also wrote, the truth will not be changed by our knowledge or by our ignorance.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.079
And we agree.

00:04:42.079 --> 00:04:49.920
In fact, no one really believes that there is no truth when it comes to physical realities such as medicine,

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.839
mathematics, or the laws of physics.

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:57.240
All people believe that some things are true.

00:04:57.279 --> 00:05:05.759
Who of us would dare to write in an airplane if we didn't believe that the laws of aerodynamics were absolute truth?

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:08.199
Very viable truth to exist.

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:14.329
They surround us and we stake our lives on them.

00:05:14.329 --> 00:05:17.089
Does the truth ever change?

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:19.250
It does not.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:29.089
Our understanding of truth changes as we progress in understanding it, but the truth never changes.

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:34.129
When Jesus said that our purpose in life was to talk about the truth,

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:39.970
He was speaking of something that faithful Jews had valued for centuries.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:49.329
In their sacred writings, the Jews had long read of truth as something concrete, not theoretical.

00:05:49.329 --> 00:05:54.290
In the Bible, truth translates the Hebrew word emith,

00:05:54.329 --> 00:06:02.410
which signifies that which is firm, solid, and perhaps most of all reliable.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.009
End of quote.

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:08.170
The Jews had good reason for viewing truth in that way.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:13.449
They called their God, Jehovah, the God of truth.

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:18.250
This was because everything Jehovah said he would do, he did.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.129
When he made promises, he kept them.

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:24.889
When he inspired prophecies, they were fulfilled.

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:30.009
When he uttered final judgments, they were carried out.

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:34.970
Millions of Israelites had been eyewitnesses of these realities.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:41.569
The inspired writers of the Bible recorded them as indisputable facts of history.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:49.610
Unlike other books viewed as sacred, the Bible is not set against a backdrop of myth or legend.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:59.009
It is firmly grounded in verifiable facts, historical, archaeological, and scientific,

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:03.529
and sociological also realities.

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:06.689
No wonder the Psalmist says to Jehovah,

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.529
you are law is truth.

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:12.490
All your commandments are truth.

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:17.689
The very essence of your word is truth.

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:23.370
Since Jehovah God is the author of the Bible, the Bible is truth.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:28.610
Jesus Christ echoed the words of that Psalm when he said in prayer to Jehovah,

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.410
you are word is truth.

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:39.769
Jesus knew that everything his father spoke was absolutely firm and reliable.

00:07:39.769 --> 00:07:44.370
Likewise, Jesus himself was full of truth.

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:50.250
Yes, Jesus was even the personification of truth.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:56.250
The Mosaic law was truth, but it was not the full truth.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:08:00.490
Jesus taught something different from the Mosaic law.

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:07.769
The Bible shows that the Mosaic law was a shadow or prophetic picture of greater realities

00:08:07.769 --> 00:08:10.649
which came through Christ.

00:08:10.649 --> 00:08:17.610
And so the Mosaic law was not the full truth, but a pattern of it.

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:21.769
Jesus was not the shadow, but the reality.

00:08:21.769 --> 00:08:24.410
He said in John 146,

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:28.660
I am the truth.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:32.700
But as far as teachings are concerned, what is truth?

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.100
What helps us to understand it?

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:40.139
The Bible speaks of the spirit of the truth.

00:08:40.139 --> 00:08:42.899
What is the spirit of the truth?

00:08:42.899 --> 00:08:46.700
It is the spirit that proceeds from Jehovah God.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.259
It is pure and holy.

00:08:49.259 --> 00:08:55.980
Jesus told His disciples at John 16, 12 and 13.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:01.059
I still have many things to say to you, but you are not able to bear them now.

00:09:01.059 --> 00:09:05.500
However, when that one comes, the spirit of the truth,

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.019
he will guide you into all the truth,

00:09:08.019 --> 00:09:14.019
for he will not speak of his own initiative, but what he hears, he will speak.

00:09:14.019 --> 00:09:18.139
And he will declare to you the things to come.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:23.860
God's spirit would teach them everything they needed to know to carry out their work,

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.539
recalling and opening up their understanding,

00:09:27.539 --> 00:09:33.940
things that previously they heard from Jesus, but had not understood.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:38.539
God's spirit would also declare to them the things coming,

00:09:38.539 --> 00:09:44.299
including the bringing to light the significance of Jesus' death and resurrection.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:48.779
As these events were then yet future and were among the things

00:09:48.779 --> 00:09:53.620
that His disciples did not understand in the beginning.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:59.779
Brother Charles Taze Russell wrote the book, The Divine Plan of the Ages.

00:09:59.779 --> 00:10:03.419
It was published in 1886.

00:10:03.419 --> 00:10:08.820
It included a discussion on the Bible as a divine revelation,

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:12.220
viewed in the light of reason.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:18.179
It said, the depth and power and wisdom and scope of the Bible's testimony

00:10:18.179 --> 00:10:25.539
convinced us that not man but Almighty God is the author,

00:10:25.539 --> 00:10:31.860
to appreciate the truth more to what can we compare the truth.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:36.620
Truth is like a mirror that helps us to see the facts

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:40.740
and if necessary to improve our looks.

00:10:40.779 --> 00:10:45.220
Truth is like a pillar, firm and supportive,

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:49.460
and it helps to combat false teachings.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:55.259
Truth is also compared to a girdle or a belt that warriors used.

00:10:55.259 --> 00:10:59.659
It helps us to continue with right conduct.

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:03.820
Truth is like a rainbow for beauty.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:08.220
Truth is as beautiful as the song of the Nightingale.

00:11:08.259 --> 00:11:14.820
Truth is like a romantic bonfire for warmth on the cold evening.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:19.019
Here's an illustration that many of you will like.

00:11:19.019 --> 00:11:23.340
Truth is like the first cup of coffee in the morning, invigorating somebody.

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:27.899
Yes, truth is invigorating.

00:11:27.899 --> 00:11:33.740
Truth is like a magnet drawing honest-hearted ones to God.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:37.299
Truth is like an oasis in the desert.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:41.740
Truth is like an anchor in the stormy seas.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:45.980
Truth is like a lifeboat on a sinking ship.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:52.940
Truth is like a lighthouse in the night guiding a boat safely to the shore or harbor.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:57.379
Truth is like a compass showing sailors the way,

00:11:57.379 --> 00:12:04.019
but it is also like a compass showing the way out of a jungle to a safe area.

00:12:04.019 --> 00:12:10.419
Truth is like the rising sun bathing landscape in warm light.

00:12:10.419 --> 00:12:15.059
Truth is like the display of fireworks for beauty.

00:12:15.059 --> 00:12:24.909
Truth is like the magnetic shield around the earth protecting it from deathly cosmic radiation.

00:12:24.909 --> 00:12:26.870
Truth is like light.

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:31.429
The fruit of light consists in every sort of truth.

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:36.870
He that does what is true comes to the light, the Bible says.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:41.950
Imagine you were born blind and received eyesight through an operation.

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:44.429
Wouldn't you be elated?

00:12:44.429 --> 00:12:50.950
Truth is like that when somebody comes to know and appreciate it.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:56.830
Truth is like a beautiful music played solo or by an orchestra.

00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:02.590
Truth is like the most delicious food for taste and gives strength.

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:07.350
Truth is what a nursing mother is to her baby.

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.549
Truth is like a hidden treasure.

00:13:09.549 --> 00:13:12.990
We need to dig for it.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:17.110
Truth is like refreshing water on a hot day.

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:19.629
Truth is like a mighty river.

00:13:19.629 --> 00:13:24.549
If you try to stop it with a dam, it will overflow the dam.

00:13:24.549 --> 00:13:27.950
Nobody can stop the truth.

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:29.190
Why?

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:34.149
Because Jehovah the Almighty is backing it up.

00:13:34.149 --> 00:13:39.389
Truth is like a flower or even a bouquet of beautiful little flowers.

00:13:39.389 --> 00:13:42.309
Brother Russell once wrote,

00:13:42.309 --> 00:13:46.909
Truth, like a modest little flower in the wilderness of life,

00:13:46.909 --> 00:13:53.309
is surrounded and almost choked by the luxurious growth of the weeds of error.

00:13:53.309 --> 00:13:56.750
If you would find it, you must be ever on the lookout.

00:13:56.750 --> 00:14:01.110
If you would see its beauty, you must brush aside the weeds of error

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:04.230
and the brambles of bigotry.

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:08.909
If you would possess it, you must stoop to get it.

00:14:08.909 --> 00:14:13.870
But not content with one flower of truth,

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:18.789
had one being sufficient, there would have been no more.

00:14:18.789 --> 00:14:22.389
Gather ever sick for more.

00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:26.309
Truth is like a fragrance or perfume.

00:14:26.309 --> 00:14:28.990
Truth is like a sparkling diamond.

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:31.429
Do you love diamonds?

00:14:31.429 --> 00:14:37.509
But the truth value is so much more than diamonds because it brings Jehovah's friendship

00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:42.299
and leads to everlasting life.

00:14:42.299 --> 00:14:45.379
Truth is compared to a way on which we walk.

00:14:45.379 --> 00:14:51.259
Second Peter 2 speaks of the way of the truth.

00:14:51.259 --> 00:14:58.299
God is a spirit and those who worship him must do so with spirit and truth.

00:14:58.299 --> 00:15:05.179
Now is the time to study the truth and attend Christian meetings where the truth is taught.

00:15:05.179 --> 00:15:08.059
Do not miss congregation meetings.

00:15:08.059 --> 00:15:15.539
First Timothy 315 compares the congregation with a pillar of truth.

00:15:15.539 --> 00:15:20.580
The congregation preserves the purity of the truth and upholds it.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:26.820
Truth Jehovah teaches us through the Bible but also through Christian meetings.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.779
We are also to speak the truth by preaching.

00:15:29.779 --> 00:15:33.259
We speak the truth also with one another.

00:15:33.259 --> 00:15:35.620
We have the truth on our lips.

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:39.100
We have the truth around our hips.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.620
Ephesians 6.14 says,

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:47.100
we have the belt of truth fastened around our waist.

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:52.899
The truth is in utter confusion.

00:15:52.899 --> 00:15:55.740
What a blessing it is to know the truth.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.860
We rejoice in it.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:02.899
We are ready to preach the truth and teach the truth.

00:16:02.899 --> 00:16:07.059
Yes, we talk the truth and we walk in the truth.

00:16:07.059 --> 00:16:10.139
In 3 John 3 we read,

00:16:10.139 --> 00:16:13.220
go on walking in the truth.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:17.700
Those who walk in the truth now will walk forever.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.860
Micah 4.5 says,

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:25.179
for all the peoples will walk each one in the name of its God.

00:16:25.179 --> 00:16:30.980
But we will walk in the name of Jehovah our God forever and ever.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:36.970
And that is a long time.

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:41.210
Help your students to love the truth and to lift the truth.

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:46.649
But if necessary, to be willing to die for the truth and for Jehovah.

00:16:46.649 --> 00:16:50.850
The truth is invincible and will conquer this wicked world.

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:55.129
Maybe all including our relatives and your Bible students

00:16:55.129 --> 00:17:01.009
have the determination to walk in the truth and talk about the truth.

00:17:01.009 --> 00:17:02.769
Why shall we do this?

00:17:02.769 --> 00:17:08.250
Because we love the truth and we love the God of truth.

00:17:08.289 --> 00:17:12.369
We are also to lift the truth by our Christian conduct.

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:15.250
Brothers, this is the truth.

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:17.609
His Word is truth.

00:17:17.609 --> 00:17:21.289
Keep talking the truth and keep walking in the truth.

00:17:21.289 --> 00:17:26.289
Then you will walk forever and praise our loving God of truth.
