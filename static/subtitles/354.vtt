00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.810
How many times have you read in our publications?

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.210
Experiences whereby someone is praying to be guided by God,

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.910
while at the same time one of our Kingdom Proclaimers is praying to be directed

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.910
to someone with whom they can share Jehovah's-inspired wisdom.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.910
What happens?

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.910
South Africa, a sister begins her auxiliary pioneer service,

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.910
praying for Jehovah to help her find someone

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.910
with whom she can study the Bible.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.909
The territory includes the home of a person

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:36.909
who had been very rude to her in the past.

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:39.909
Courageously, she knocks on the door anyway

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:42.909
and discovers that new tenants live there,

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:46.909
a mother and daughter who had been praying for someone

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:49.909
to help them understand the Bible.

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:55.909
Soon, all three were out in service together.

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:59.909
The angels certainly know how to work these things out.

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:01.909
Is it reasonable then to believe

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:04.909
that the angels could also play a role in ensuring

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.909
that baptized Christians get the information that they need

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.909
either to receive or to give?

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.909
As our text indicates, Jehovah guides us with his advice.

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.909
How does that work?

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.909
Well, often we find ourselves in need of wisdom.

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.909
We pray to Jehovah for direction.

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.909
We search the Bible.

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:29.909
We search our Christian publications.

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.909
And at times, we ask people who are already wise for their advice.

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.909
After all, insight volume two under wisdom refers to this

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.909
as a superior and time-saving way to wisdom.

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.909
Superior, that is, to experiencing punishment

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.909
or watching other people go through it.

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.909
The insight book then cites Proverbs 22, 17.

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.909
Let's read that together.

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.909
Proverbs chapter 22, verse 17,

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.909
which says, Incline your ear and listen to the words of the wise

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:11.909
in order to apply your heart to my knowledge.

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:15.909
Who is the my in the expression my knowledge?

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:18.909
Well, Jehovah is speaking to us through the pages of his word,

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:24.909
indicating that if we listen to counsel from wise people,

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:29.909
we can, in fact, detect the wisdom of Jehovah.

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:35.909
Moreover, Psalm 328 gives us this promise.

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:40.909
I will give you insight and instruct you in the way you should go.

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:45.909
I will give you advice with my eye upon you.

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:49.909
Now, does that mean that if we pray intensely,

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:53.909
Jehovah will give us tailor-made counsel designed to fit

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:57.909
our individual circumstances,

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.909
that somehow through either an encouraging visit

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.909
by a mature Christian, a talk at one of the meetings

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:07.909
or some information in one of our publications,

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:10.909
we will find exactly what we need.

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:17.909
Yes, prayers are often answered in that exact way.

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:19.909
Now, with regard to elders' meetings,

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:22.909
our brothers are trained to recognize that Christ,

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:26.909
by means of His Holy Spirit, can influence any elder,

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:30.909
even the youngest, most reticent elder on the body,

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:36.909
to make an expression that results in wise decisions.

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:39.909
Decisions that may not have been reached

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:43.909
if each elder had been consulted individually.

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:45.909
But now, does that mean that every expression

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:50.909
made by an elder automatically reflects the knowledge of God?

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.909
We have to remember that just as one who desires wisdom

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:56.909
has a responsibility to seek it,

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:01.909
so likewise, one who gives advice has a responsibility

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:04.909
to base his comments on Jehovah's inspired word.

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:10.909
Sometimes, emotion may get the better of an advisor.

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.909
How can we tell whether that is taking place?

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:17.910
Turn with me, please, to 1 Samuel 23.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.910
1 Samuel 23.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.910
How many times did King David receive advice

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.910
from the likes of God, Nathan, Abigail, Abishai, others?

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.910
How did David respond to it?

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.910
First, please note that David had the admirable habit

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.910
of inquiring of Jehovah before making decisions.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.910
Look at what it says here in chapter 23 for Samuel 23.2.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.910
So, David inquired of Jehovah.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.910
Should I go and strike down these Philistines?

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.910
Jehovah said to David, go, strike down the Philistines

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.910
and rescue Kyla.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.910
But the men of David said to him, look, we are afraid.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.910
Well, here in Judah, how much more so if we go to Kyla

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.910
against the battle line of the Philistines?

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.910
So, David inquired once again of Jehovah

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.910
and many other texts show that this was David's practice.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.910
Of course, there were also notable occasions

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.910
when David did not first inquire of Jehovah,

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.910
such as when he determined to destroy Nable

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.910
and every male in his household as reported in chapter 25.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.910
But David recognized, in the words of Abigail,

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.910
the knowledge of Jehovah.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:39.910
Notice what he said at first Samuel 25, 32 and 33.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.910
At this, David said to Abigail,

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.910
praise Jehovah the God of Israel

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.910
who sent you this day to meet me and blessed be your good sense.

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.910
May you be blessed for restraining me this day

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.910
from incurring blood guilt

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.910
and from taking revenge with my own hands.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.910
Abigail brought Bible principles back to David's mind

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.910
and he could see that this was from Jehovah.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.910
And yet there were other times when David's advisors

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.910
were pointing to what they considered to be proof

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.910
of Jehovah's divine intervention,

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.910
but David did not buy into it.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.910
Notice what it says at first Samuel chapter 24.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.910
And verse 4.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.420
David's man said to him,

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:37.420
this is the day on which Jehovah is saying to you,

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.420
look, I am giving your enemy into your hand

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.420
and you can do to him whatever seems good to you.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.420
Now, how would David respond to that?

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.420
Would he say, you're right.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.420
Saul tried to kill me three times.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.420
He's been hunting me for years.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.420
He's obviously lost Jehovah's Holy Spirit.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.420
Isn't that why Samuel anointed me?

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.420
And now look, here he is by himself vulnerable

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.420
in our very cave.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.420
When does that ever happen?

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.420
Clearly, Jehovah has given me this opportunity

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.420
to seize the kingship.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:15.420
David did not draw that conclusion.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.420
Why not?

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:20.420
We get a clue in first Samuel chapter 26.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.420
Notice once again the counsel he receives in verse 8.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:28.420
Was it a coincidence that David and his men now find Saul

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.420
and his army of 3,000 men totally incapacitated

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.420
by deep sleep?

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.420
When does that ever happen?

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.420
Clearly, that was a gift from God.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.420
That was what a bish I thought.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.420
And so he said in verse 8.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.420
Today, God has surrendered your enemy into your hand.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.420
And now please let me pin him to the ground

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.420
with the Spirit just once.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.420
And I will not need to do it twice.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.420
Was that really counsel from God?

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:03.420
Or just well-intentioned advice driven by emotion?

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.420
David rejected it.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.420
Why?

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.420
Was he thinking about Bible principles?

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.420
Was he thinking about Leviticus chapter 19 verse 18?

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:16.420
You must not take revenge?

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.420
Likely, as we read what it says in verses 10 and 11,

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.420
notice what it says.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.420
As shortly as Jehovah is living,

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.420
Jehovah himself will strike him down.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.420
Or his day will come and he will die.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.419
Or he will go down into battle and perish.

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:36.419
It is unthinkable from Jehovah's standpoint for me

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:40.419
to lift my hand against the anointed of Jehovah.

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:43.419
David loved Jehovah's word.

00:08:44.419 --> 00:08:49.419
He tried to consider each situation from Jehovah's standpoint.

00:08:49.419 --> 00:08:53.419
He sought to discern the difference between God's knowledge

00:08:53.419 --> 00:08:56.419
and human reasoning.

00:08:56.419 --> 00:09:00.419
Today we too may face a difficult situation, a decision.

00:09:00.419 --> 00:09:02.419
Someone might even encourage us to take action

00:09:02.419 --> 00:09:05.419
without fully considering God's will.

00:09:05.419 --> 00:09:10.419
We need to pray for Jehovah to direct our hearts to his knowledge,

00:09:10.419 --> 00:09:14.419
not only that we may receive it, but even that we might convey it

00:09:14.419 --> 00:09:15.419
when appropriate.

00:09:15.419 --> 00:09:20.419
Sometimes you may be the one who needs to give the word of guidance

00:09:20.419 --> 00:09:23.419
in choir of Jehovah.

00:09:23.419 --> 00:09:27.419
Make sure your counsel is in harmony with his word.

00:09:27.419 --> 00:09:32.419
If it is, and if the recipient also has a prayerful attitude,

00:09:32.419 --> 00:09:38.419
then he too may feel as in the words of today's inspired text writer

00:09:38.419 --> 00:09:43.419
that Jehovah is guiding us with his advice.
