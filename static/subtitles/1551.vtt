00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:16.989
Hey, buddy, that was cool.

00:00:16.989 --> 00:00:23.260
That's my dad, Grayson, and my older brother, Dylan.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.260
Hey, bro, we're going to play ball. You want to come?

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.699
No thanks.

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:29.699
Is he okay?

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.699
He normally lives at my class school.

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:32.700
Mm-hmm.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.070
He didn't want to talk about school today.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:43.070
It wasn't my worst day at school, but pretty close.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.070
It all started first thing this morning.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.070
Everyone was signing a birthday card for one of our classmates, Lucas.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.070
He just got home from being at the hospital for cancer treatments.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.899
No thanks. Some of Jehovah's Witnesses and I don't celebrate birthdays.

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:13.719
My teacher said that Lucas may not come back to school for a long time.

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:16.719
I felt so bad he was sick.

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:27.459
He didn't.

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:28.459
Can you think about him?

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:37.219
The thing is, I did want to sign the card.

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:44.939
Lucas was one of the nicest people in my class.

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.939
Maybe I can just sign it.

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.290
I mean, it's not like I'm going to a birthday party.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:02.180
Hey, little man, how you doing?

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.180
Yeah?

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.180
When dad came in, I told him everything that happened.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.710
I know from the Bible that it's wrong to celebrate birthdays.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.090
But is signing the card really a big deal?

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.430
Dad said my question was a good one.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.430
Then he showed me a scripture.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.430
Ephesians 5-10.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.430
Keep on making sure of what is acceptable to the Lord.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.430
He said, we all have to keep making sure of what's acceptable to Jehovah.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.430
Because Satan is a master at tricking us.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.430
Then he used the example of Aaron.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:03:00.870
The Israelites asked Aaron to make them a god.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.870
So Aaron made a golden calf, thinking that it could represent Jehovah.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.870
He told the people, there's a festival to Jehovah tomorrow.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.870
But true worship was being mixed with false worship.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.870
And Jehovah was not happy.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.819
And many were punished.

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.819
That example helped me a lot.

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:37.650
I know birthdays are wrong because the Bible teaches that they are not approved by Jehovah.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:45.650
But we don't want to be confused like Aaron and try to mix true and false worship.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.650
We want to make Jehovah happy.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:54.620
So Dad said, it's always good to ask.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.620
How would Jehovah feel if I do this?

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.620
I stood inside the card, but I'm going to do something else for Lucas.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:27.180
Can I go see Lucas?

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:45.420
And then I realized something.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:51.420
Instead of celebrating one day, I could share with Lucas our hope of living forever.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.420
On a beautiful paradise earth.
