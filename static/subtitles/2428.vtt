00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.739
Like a letter from a loved one

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:19.739
That I'm reading every day

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:22.739
As I turn the precious pages

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:26.739
And so many thoughts that come my way

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:28.739
And every day that passes

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:32.740
Gives me reason to be sure

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.740
That the things that I am reading

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.740
Will comfort me some more

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.740
Like the dew there in the morning

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.740
Like the warmth that's from the sun

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.020
Like the moon, I don't know

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.020
It's there for everyone

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.020
Like a pillow is for comfort

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.020
So your words can comfort me

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.020
And as I meditate on this

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.019
It's easy just to see

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.019
It's filled with love

00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:12.670
Jehovah's love

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:26.739
Reminds me not to worry

00:01:26.739 --> 00:01:29.739
Now that travel never lasts

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:32.739
Gives me hope for the future

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:36.739
Helps me learn from the past

00:01:36.739 --> 00:01:39.739
Your promise draws me close to you

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:42.739
As you draw close to me

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:45.739
And once again I'm thankful

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:48.739
For the gifts that I can see

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:51.739
Like the dew there in the morning

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:55.739
Like the warmth that's from the sun

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:57.739
Like the moon, I don't know

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:02.310
It's there for everyone

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.310
Like a pillow is for comfort

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.310
So your words can comfort me

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.310
And as I meditate on this

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.310
It's easy just to see

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.900
It's filled with love

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.900
Jehovah's love

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:37.319
The tree growing by a stream

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.319
I'm stronger every day

00:02:40.319 --> 00:03:00.379
Just how much your word means to me

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.379
Like a letter from a loved one

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:06.379
That I'm reading every day

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.379
As I turn the precious pages

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:13.379
It's how many thoughts that come my way

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.379
And every day that passes

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:19.379
Gives me reason to be sure

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.379
With the things that I am waiting

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.379
It will comfort me some more

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.379
Like the dew there in the morning

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.379
Like the warmth that's from the sun

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.379
Like the moon, I don't know

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:37.860
It's there for everyone

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.860
Like a pillow is for comfort

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.860
So your words can comfort me

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.860
And as I meditate on this

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.860
It's easy just to see

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.860
It's filled with love

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.860
Jehovah's love
