00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:10.240
Despite a 26-year ban, the Theocratic landscape in Malau is changing for the better.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.240
What has contributed to such a change?

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.839
Largely, divine education.

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:23.920
Specifically, the schools for single-brothers, Christian couples, have had a major impact

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.239
on advancing theocracy.

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.980
Starting with ministerial training school and Gilead graduates, the real excitement

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:39.880
came in 2008 when the first class of MTS was held in the vernacular language in Malawi

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.759
called Chichewa.

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:51.200
To date, over 400 brothers, 36 Christian couples and 47 travelling overseers and their wives

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.439
have shared this specialised training that they received with those even in the most

00:00:56.439 --> 00:01:00.719
remote parts of Malawi.

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.599
As a result, congregations are being stabilised and built up in the faith.

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:11.400
But why is this such a thrilling development for Malawi?

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:20.879
Well, as we all know, Satan can use a country's environment or culture to stifle Theocratic

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:25.599
progress and Malawi is no exception to this.

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:35.439
For example, typical rural life in Malawi does not involve keeping to a schedule or time.

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.359
Sorry for that.

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:44.359
Just imagine, brothers, you don't have a watch or a clock, the only way of telling the

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:50.439
time is to look at the position of the sun in the sky.

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:57.159
You have between four and ten or possibly more children to get ready and prepare for

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.760
Theocratic activities.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.079
You don't have a vehicle, there's no public transport, but you've got to work between

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:11.159
one and three hours or two or three hours to get to the kingdom hall.

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:19.000
Now with that picture in mind, how likely is it that meetings will start, run and finish

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:20.840
on time?

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.210
The answer is obvious, isn't it?

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.090
Another challenge in Malawi is chief mentality.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:36.169
You see, in Malawi, village life revolves around the authority of one man or woman who is

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:39.409
appointed as chief.

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:45.689
When this is the norm, it's a huge challenge not to allow this structure to creep into

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:48.729
the Christian congregation.

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:53.889
Just to the training mentioned earlier of all the Theocratic schools, though, congregations

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:59.849
are experiencing an increase in shepherds who really shepherd the flock, as promised by

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:06.050
Jehovah at Jerry Mayer, chapter 23 and verse 4.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.729
What are the exciting developments are we seeing in Malawi?

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:13.490
Remote translation officers.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:19.810
Currently, we have one fully operational article in the north of Malawi, and happily

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:27.949
as we speak now, two new articles are also under construction.

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:33.669
Singing kingdom songs has always been an absolute delight for the brothers in Malawi,

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:35.430
just as it is here.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:43.389
However, with little money to spend and no electricity in over 80% of the kingdom halls

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:50.270
in Malawi, learning how to sing the new kingdom songs has been very difficult.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:56.590
For example, oftentimes, the brothers just read the songs out loud, not really knowing

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.189
the tune.

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:05.150
Therefore, recently, the organization researched what type of appliance could be designed

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.189
and manufactured specifically to address this problem.

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:19.829
The appliance would have to be portable, extremely durable, simple to use, and chargeable

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.550
even in remote areas where there's no electricity.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.870
Quite a feat to accomplish.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.069
As always, though, Jehovah's organization has come up with a solution.

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:38.029
The governing body has approved the purchase of a simple purpose-built music player, which

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:44.149
is now in the process of being sent out to all congregations, even the remote parts of

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:47.430
Malawi with this need.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:53.629
How did congregations respond upon hearing about this new provision?

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:58.910
Just to give you an example of one letter, an excerpt from one letter, this is a translation

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:05.279
of what the brothers wrote, and very typical of what many letters contain.

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:09.680
To be honest, brothers, we've not been doing very well at singing.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.759
Isn't that sweet, honestly, beautiful?

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:20.360
But when we get this music player, we will really, really sing praises to Jehovah.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:26.959
Please, please, please, please send us one as soon as possible.

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:31.720
Yes, brothers, this appreciation has moved many congregations to send with their letter

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:40.759
even a voluntary donation, which is truly, as Jesus said at Luke 21 verse 4, a gift not

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:45.240
out of their surplus, but out of their want.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.079
As you can see, brothers, these few highlights give evidence of Jehovah's loving watch care

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:52.439
over his people in Malawi.

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:58.839
We give thanks to Jehovah for his education, his building and his building programs and

00:05:58.839 --> 00:05:59.839
his generosity.
