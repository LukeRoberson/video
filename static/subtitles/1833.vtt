Welcome to this edition of Extraordinary Experiences.

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:09.849
We're very happy to have with us today Ladiens Cecilia Sanding serving a special pioneers in the country of Sierra Leone.

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:14.849
You attended the 144th class of Gilead. Welcome, very nice to have you with us.

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:15.849
Thank you.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:26.850
On March 23rd, 1991, the Civil War in Liberia spilled across the borders into Sierra Leone, and this ignited an 11-year civil war.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:34.850
Ladi, could you tell us what were the conditions like as war came to free town, where the branch was located?

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:46.850
It was total chaos, no law and order. Lawlessness was at its highest peak, and it was terrible.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.850
In your interview on the inside story, you related how the branch at one point was attacked.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.850
You explained to us, Ladi, what happened after that? What did you do after that attack?

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.850
We have to leave the branch because it was no safe.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:14.849
People were just shouting that rebels are coming and protecting people, so we decided to head for another missionary home on the other side of town.

00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:21.849
We just went along with the crowd, and we made a military roadblock.

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:28.849
The acts that we should not go beyond that roadblock, we have to spend the night sleeping on the streets.

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:37.849
I tried to persist and the refuse the one that if I continue to act in them, they would shoot at me.

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:40.849
Cecilia, what were you thinking at this time?

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:45.849
I felt like my whole body was numb out of fear.

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:56.849
And all I was just praying for inside, I was praying for resurrection, not protection to Jehovah, because all I could see in front of us were death.

00:01:56.849 --> 00:02:02.849
So I was just praying that Jehovah should please remember or see the resurrection.

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:05.849
And we just left everything in Jehovah's hand.

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:09.849
Now, when the morning came, what did you do in the morning?

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:16.849
We decided to return because it was quiet and a little bit safe, so we returned to secure the branch.

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:25.849
To go back to the branch was a big decision for us, because we didn't feel any safe any longer.

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.849
To stay at that to the branch or to the missionary home.

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.849
We left everything in Jehovah's hands, and we did what the brothers told us to,

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.849
that don't worry, Jehovah will keep protecting us.

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.849
So we went back to the branch and we continued to stay there.

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:44.849
Okay.

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:51.849
What would you say really helped the brothers and sisters during this time period of war in Sierra Leone?

00:02:51.849 --> 00:03:00.849
As love for Jehovah and the brotherhood, the remain active with bureaucratic routine activities,

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:10.849
attending Christian meetings, having family, worship, getting together as a brotherhood that was really keeping them going.

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.849
So meeting attendance was important then, would you say Cecilia?

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:20.849
Very much, very important. Before any problem, we have to develop love for meeting.

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:26.849
Because if we have the habit of missing meeting, it would be challenging in times of trouble.

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:32.849
What would happen if somebody who usually came to the meetings didn't come to the meeting?

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.849
We have to go in search of him or the family, if the family is not there.

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:43.849
Because during the war, we do not access to mobile phones.

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.849
The telephone system was terrible.

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:53.849
So we have to take the risk, make sure they are okay and we return home.

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.849
So during this time, if somebody who regularly came to the meetings wasn't there,

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:03.849
brothers would go out and risk their life to find them, to make sure they are okay.

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.849
That's a really powerful reminder. Thank you.

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.849
Ladi, did you have anything else you'd like to add or to share with us?

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:20.850
Well, in times of difficulties, we need to pray to Jehovah for courage, to face challenges in life.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.850
Because Jehovah indeed will help us.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:29.850
And the collective prayers on our behalf, from the brotherhood, Jehovah,

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:37.850
do listen to such prayers. That works really, I learned personally during those war period in Civilian.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.850
I don't know where the courage comes from, as late as Jehovah that gives the courage

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.850
and our collective prayer for our brothers also help.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.850
Thank you very much. You thank both of you very much.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.850
And we thank you to friends for being with us and we look forward to being together again

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.850
for another edition of Extraordinary Experiences.
