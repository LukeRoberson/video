WEBVTT

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.099
Now, if we think about Jesus' words in today's text,

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:10.099
give us today our bread for this day,

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.099
there's really indirect counsel against materialism.

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.100
See, Jesus didn't say to pray for our daily meat

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.100
or some other luxury food item.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.100
He didn't even say that we should pray for a month's supply of bread.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.100
Pray for and be content with our bread for the day.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.100
But as we know, a sizable number of Jehovah's people today

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.100
are being distracted by materialism.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.100
So, since this is not an imagined,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.100
but it's a real danger to Jehovah's people,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:54.100
let's discuss the theme, beware of the power of materialism.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.100
I recall the story of a sister and her two sons

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.099
who were exiled to Siberia.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.099
Now, they were very poor.

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:09.099
In fact, they were so poor at times

00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:14.099
they had to literally eat the bark off trees to survive.

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:17.099
But they were happy because they were all in the truth.

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:21.099
But years passed and the three of them had opportunity

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:24.099
to immigrate to the United States.

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:28.099
The two sons got excellent jobs, high paying jobs,

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:32.099
as machinas, but in their material prosperity,

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:36.099
both sons fell out of the truth.

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:38.099
The sister tearfully remarked,

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:40.099
I would rather be back in Siberia,

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:43.099
eating the bark off trees to survive,

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:48.099
but with my two sons still in the truth.

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:52.099
Well, numerous other experiences could be related

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:55.099
that illustrate the power of materialism.

00:01:55.099 --> 00:02:00.099
In fact, it may well be that Satan's most effective trap

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:05.099
against Jehovah's people in these last days is materialism.

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:07.099
But now you might be thinking,

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:11.099
well, isn't sexual immorality by far the number one cause

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.099
for disfellowshipping?

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.099
That's true.

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.099
But we don't have figures for ones who fall away to materialism.

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.099
They're not disfellowshipped.

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.099
And furthermore, how many who succumbed as sexual immorality

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:30.099
were first weakened spiritually by materialism?

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.099
Well, at least we can say that materialism

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.099
is one of Satan's most effective tools

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.099
are traps against Jehovah's people today.

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.099
And no wonder that humans and Satan's world

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.099
are bombarded with so many advertising messages designed

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.099
to make us want things, even if we don't need these things.

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.099
There was an awake magazine a while back

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.099
that discussed how that Americans may be bombarded

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:07.099
with up to 1,600 advertising messages every day.

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.099
Imagine that.

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:14.099
And none of us can feel we're immune to this pressure

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.099
that it can't happen to us.

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:17.099
It can happen to any of us.

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:22.099
We could slowly gradually begin to desire material things,

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.099
even things we don't really need.

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.099
In fact, that makes me think of the story.

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:33.099
A circuit overseer told many years ago I was a young teenager.

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.099
That was over 50 years ago.

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.099
He and his wife lived in a little trailer

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.099
they would park by the Kingdom Hall.

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.099
And he told one of his talks how he bought a drill

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.099
to do work on his trailer.

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.099
But then shortly after he bought this drill,

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.099
they came out with a reversible drill.

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.099
And he thought, well, you know, that'd be nice

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.099
to have a reversible drill.

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.099
It would be much easier to extract the drill bit

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.099
out of the hole, so he bought a reversible drill.

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.099
Shortly after that, they came out with a reversible drill

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.099
had a little light on it.

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.099
You pull the trigger, a little light would come on.

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:13.099
And he thought, you know, that would be really nice.

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.099
My drill doesn't have a little light on it.

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.100
He was about ready to buy this latest model.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.100
And then he said, wait a minute.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.100
What am I doing?

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.100
How often am I going to be drilling at night?

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.310
But he told that to illustrate how that materialism

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.310
can get a hold on any of us.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.310
He was being manipulated by Satan's system.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.310
But now here's a question.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.310
What Bible principles can help us avoid this deadly trap

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.310
materialism?

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.310
Let's discuss two.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.310
Now there are many others.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.310
But these two can really help us.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.310
Let's go to Micah chapter 7.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.310
And let's get this first Bible principle really can help us.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.310
Micah 7 verse 7.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.310
But as for me, I will keep on the lookout for Jehovah.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.310
Now notice, I will show a waiting attitude

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.310
for the God of my salvation.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.310
My God will hear me.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.310
Or the footnote, I will wait patiently.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.310
See, are we willing to wait patiently on Jehovah?

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.310
This certainly applies to material things.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.310
Jehovah, in effect, is telling us today

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.310
I'm giving you a spiritual paradise right now.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.310
Be content with that.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.310
Don't try to get your physical paradise now.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.310
I'll give you that later.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.310
But the question is, are we willing to wait on Jehovah?

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.310
See, or do we in effect run ahead of him

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.310
and try to acquire physical paradise

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.310
conditions for ourselves right now

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:04.310
at the expense of spiritual activity?

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.310
Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 1.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.310
There's an appointed time for everything.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.310
Well, Jehovah's appointed our time,

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.310
especially these last days of the last days,

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.310
shortly before the last day of this old system,

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.310
not as a time to seek and spend time

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.310
acquiring physical comforts,

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.310
but rather as a time to beautify the spiritual paradise

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.310
and help others join us in this paradise.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:41.310
No wonder, at 1 Peter 1 1 and 2 11,

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:46.310
God's people are described as temporary residents.

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.310
And it's a real protection if we think of ourselves that way.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.310
Temporary residents.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.310
Now, the illustration has been used

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.310
of staying in a hotel room.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.310
Now, you know when you're in a hotel room,

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.310
you're a temporary resident.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.310
You might do a few things to make your stay more comfortable.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.310
You might rearrange the chairs.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.310
You might reposition the lamps.

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:12.310
You might buy some flowers, put it on a table.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.310
You might spray some air freshener.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.310
But you would never rip off the wallpaper

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.310
and install new wallpaper.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.310
You'd never rip up the carpet,

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.310
install new carpet or tile.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.310
You wouldn't buy new furniture.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:32.310
You'd keep it simple, because you know you're going to be checking out.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:36.310
Now, even if you ended up staying a few months in that hotel room,

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:40.310
especially if you didn't know exactly when you're going to have to check out,

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:42.310
you would still keep it simple.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.310
Well, that describes our situation.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:48.310
We're going to check out of this old system.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:51.310
We're going to check into the new world.

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:53.310
We don't know exactly when, but you know us soon.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.310
So we keep it simple.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.310
We're temporary residents.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.310
But now, let's get a second Bible principle.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:03.310
It can help us avoid materialism.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.310
Let's go to Luke chapter 10.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:14.310
And Jesus' words here can help us identify this second Bible principle.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:18.310
Luke 10 verse 42, the B part Jesus said,

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:24.310
for her part, Mary chose the good portion.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.310
And it will not be taken away from her.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:32.309
You notice she chose the good portion, the footnote, the best portion.

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:34.309
Now, we know the story.

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:38.309
Martha chose physical activity.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:41.309
She chose working in the kitchen.

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:45.309
Mary chose spiritual activity, listening to Jesus.

00:08:45.309 --> 00:08:48.309
Jesus correctly identified who made the best choice.

00:08:48.309 --> 00:08:50.309
Who chose the best portion?

00:08:50.309 --> 00:08:52.309
Well, similarly with us.

00:08:52.309 --> 00:08:58.309
When we choose storing up treasure in heaven, over storing up treasure on the earth,

00:08:58.309 --> 00:09:01.309
we are choosing the best portion.

00:09:01.309 --> 00:09:03.309
How so?

00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:06.309
Well, if one thing, it brings to you, hope is blessing.

00:09:06.309 --> 00:09:09.309
And that results in happiness.

00:09:09.309 --> 00:09:13.309
You know what Proverbs 10, 22 says,

00:09:13.309 --> 00:09:18.309
it is the blessing of Jehovah, that makes one rich.

00:09:18.309 --> 00:09:21.309
And he has no pain with it.

00:09:21.309 --> 00:09:25.309
In contrast, 1 Timothy 6, 9, and 10,

00:09:25.309 --> 00:09:30.309
speak about how those that go out for money, material things,

00:09:30.309 --> 00:09:37.309
they can end up stabbing themselves all over with many pains.

00:09:37.309 --> 00:09:39.309
Now, you're not a contrast.

00:09:39.309 --> 00:09:42.309
Blessing from Jehovah with no pain,

00:09:42.309 --> 00:09:45.309
stabbing yourself all over with many pains.

00:09:45.309 --> 00:09:48.309
Well, we're choosing the best portion when we go for spiritual,

00:09:48.309 --> 00:09:50.309
a heavenly treasure.

00:09:50.309 --> 00:09:56.309
Now, another reason, heavenly treasure will result in preservation into the new world.

00:09:56.309 --> 00:09:59.309
If necessary, by means of the resurrection.

00:09:59.309 --> 00:10:05.309
Proverbs 11, 4, wealth will be of no benefit on the day of fury,

00:10:05.309 --> 00:10:10.309
but righteousness is what will rescue from death.

00:10:10.309 --> 00:10:14.309
So, remembering those two Bible principles can really help us.

00:10:14.309 --> 00:10:19.309
Remember that we are to wait on Jehovah.

00:10:19.309 --> 00:10:24.309
And he says, spiritual paradise now, physical paradise later,

00:10:24.309 --> 00:10:26.309
we wait on him.

00:10:26.309 --> 00:10:28.309
And when we do that, that second principle,

00:10:28.309 --> 00:10:30.309
we're choosing the best portion.

00:10:30.309 --> 00:10:33.309
And we're going to be happy we're going to get Jehovah's blessings.

00:10:33.309 --> 00:10:36.309
And if we do this, then like Moses,

00:10:36.309 --> 00:10:42.309
we'll choose treasures greater than the treasures of Egypt.

00:10:42.309 --> 00:10:49.309
We'll be able to do what Jesus said to pray for and be content with our daily bread.
