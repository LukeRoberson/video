00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:07.679
The opening song of our convention program reminded us that our reasons for joy are abundant,

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:13.980
and that true joy is well-founded with roots reaching deep in God's Word.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.379
Just as a tree anchors itself in the earth nourishing soil,

00:00:18.379 --> 00:00:22.280
so true joy is anchored in the sayings of Jehovah,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.179
and those sayings promise us joy that will last forever.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.579
But isn't it also true that Satan's world promises to give us joy?

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.880
Yet any measure of joy derive from things in Satan's world,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.280
such as pursuing wealth, wrongdoing, extreme views of work,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.479
or friendships in the world, is a false joy that is short-lived.

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:49.479
Think back to our illustration of the tree.

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:53.979
Can a tree survive if its roots have been poisoned with chemicals?

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:55.679
Of course not.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.780
Well, how long will we experience joy if we seek it in this poisonous world of Satan?

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.079
Not long at all.

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:07.980
This symposium will contrast what the world teaches about joy

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.579
with what God's Word teaches.

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:14.280
As you listen and watch, consider these questions.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.680
Why do the world's ways of finding joy not work?

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.980
And am I pursuing what truly contributes to joy?

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:31.239
In this talk, we'll discuss how pursuing a simple life contributes to joy.

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:35.840
The world teaches that pursuing wealth and having money will make you happy.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.439
And an illustration of Jesus at Luke 12 highlights that point.

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.140
Please turn there with me.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.439
Luke 12.

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.840
In the illustration, the land of a rich man produced well,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.939
he planned on building bigger storehouses,

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.640
and noticed Luke 12 verse 19 with the man said himself.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.939
You have many good things stored up for many years.

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:04.040
Take it easy, eat, drink, enjoy yourself.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.739
So the man thought that because of having many good things,

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:11.340
he could enjoy them for many years.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.240
But notice what God told him according to verse 20.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.740
Unreasonable one, this night they are demanding your life from you.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.639
Who then is to have the things you stored up?

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:29.639
So in reality, the man's joy from pursuing wealth was short-lived.

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:34.039
To further illustrate this point, as you watch the following dramatization,

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:58.659
consider how a brother responds to an offer of more money and how it affects his joy.

00:02:58.659 --> 00:02:59.659
You wanted to see me?

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:04.250
Yeah, come on in and go ahead and close the door, please.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.150
Thanks for coming up.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.349
Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.250
And Ben, all of your projects have come in on schedule and under budget.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.150
We're really impressed, and we want to move you up to the management team.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.349
Now, you had up the whole division to start.

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.150
Management team, I like the sound of that.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.849
Not to mention the pay raise and the bonuses.

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.849
It did sound like a lot more work, but Victor was so positive.

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.849
There may be a little overtime here and there, but I wouldn't worry about it.

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.550
Not with your skill.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.150
He told me I could think about it before deciding.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.550
But come on.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.919
This was a no-brainer.

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:48.120
The new position was great.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.620
And the money?

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.919
Well, that wasn't too bad either.

00:03:54.919 --> 00:04:01.060
It was exciting to work directly with clients.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:10.509
But the hours were crazy.

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:12.710
Our seldom the same.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.709
We see an example of this in this week's Bible reading.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.110
True worship, the right thing, was not easy.

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.509
So required hard work.

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:27.550
King Hezekiah demonstrated his...

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.449
So a question for the audience is, how could we explain this to someone?

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:38.300
Able, please.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:50.930
Most nights, I was wiped out.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:05:11.089
And I have to admit, even when I wasn't working, I was working.

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:16.889
As highlighted in the video, why will pursuing money not make us happy?

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.790
Because we wouldn't be following Jehovah's advice.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:26.990
And that would cause us to fall into a snare or trap, as mentioned at 1 Timothy chapter 6 verse 9.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.689
Without our even realizing it, that snare can consume our time.

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:35.990
Time that we need to be spending on spiritual things.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.790
How was that shown in the video?

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:45.290
Well, the pay raise, bonuses, new car, and other things may have made our brother happy for a short time.

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:50.290
However, did you notice how pursuing money was a snare for him?

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.990
Most nights, he was exhausted from working long hours.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.990
He arrived late to the meeting and fell asleep.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.790
And did you notice what happened to his participation in the field ministry,

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.889
the most important work on earth?

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:06.490
It suffered, didn't it?

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:12.389
He wasn't prepared, and he experienced interruptions from his workplace.

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:17.889
It's true that money is useful, and we need it to buy food, shelter, and clothing.

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:24.399
But trading spiritual things for wealth is always a poor investment.

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:32.600
On the other hand, a life focused on serving Jehovah is a simple life that brings deep and lasting joy.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.300
Jesus emphasized this in his words at Matthew 6.22.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.699
If then your eye is focused, your whole body will be bright.

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:48.699
The basic meaning of the Greek word for focused is single or simple.

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:54.199
It can convey the idea of singleness of mind or devotion to one purpose.

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:58.199
For example, if we focus our life on material things,

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:01.199
they could take up a lot of our time and energy,

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:06.699
and we may not take time to pray, study, or preach.

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:12.100
How much better to follow Jesus' instruction and keep our life simple?

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:18.600
By focusing on putting God's service first in our life, we'll have true joy.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.100
As you watch the following dramatization,

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:27.110
consider how our brother gains joy when he makes a different decision.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:31.110
We're really impressed, and we want to move you up to the management team.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:34.110
Now, you head up the whole division to start.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:39.370
Victor's offer really took me by surprise.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:47.329
And wow, the perks were tempting.

00:07:47.329 --> 00:07:50.829
But I knew there was a lot at stake.

00:07:50.829 --> 00:07:59.860
So I told him I talked to Lisa and get back to him tomorrow.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:09.050
What was this job going to mean for our spiritual goals?

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:15.839
Would we still be able to keep our life simple?

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:39.500
Were we ready to trade our time together as a family for more money?

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:45.100
The next day, I told Victor how much I appreciated the opportunity,

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:50.100
but felt that it just wasn't the right fit for our family.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.100
Money was tight, but we were okay.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:58.330
We had what we needed.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:03.330
Saying no to that promotion meant holding off on a few upgrades.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:15.070
But it also meant more time for meeting preparation,

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:31.419
more time for the ministry, and more time for each other.

00:09:31.419 --> 00:09:41.340
Did you notice the happiness of our brother and his family

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.340
when he decided to live a simple life?

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.840
But why does a simple life bring us happiness?

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.340
Ecclesiastes chapter 5 verse 12 highlights one reason.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:52.840
Let's look at that together.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.340
Ecclesiastes chapter 5 verse 12.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:59.340
Why does a simple life bring us happiness?

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.340
The verse says,

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.840
Sweet is the sleep of the one serving,

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.840
whether he eats little or much.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.840
But the plenty belonging to the rich one does not permit him to sleep.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.840
So those who possess much may be anxious about losing their possessions,

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.840
and thus lose sleep worrying about them.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.840
In contrast, those with little materially have less to worry about,

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:28.840
and they can enjoy as the verse says, sweet sleep.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:34.840
The point, when we refuse to allow material things to interfere with our sacred service,

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:39.840
we gain satisfaction, peace, and joy.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:44.340
So if you're presented with an offer like the one given to our brother in the video,

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.340
what should you do?

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.840
First, pray.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:53.340
Pray for help to make a decision that will be pleasing to Jehovah.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.840
Then ask yourself,

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.840
Will this decision complicate my life?

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.340
And how will this affect the time I spend serving Jehovah?

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:08.840
Questions like those helped our brother in the video to make a decision that brought great joy.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:13.340
Remember, any decision you make that promotes a simple life,

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:17.840
focused on serving Jehovah, will lead to joy that is well-founded,

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.340
with roots reaching deep in God's Word.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:28.340
May all of us attain the true joy that comes from living a simple life.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.840
But a simple life is not the only thing that leads to joy.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.840
Listen as Brother Robert Saranco, a helper to the writing committee,

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.840
now considers the next talk of this symposium.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.340
What contributes to joy?

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.340
A clean conscience.
