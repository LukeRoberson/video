00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:08.699
One day in April 2011, the Overseer Body of Video Services came downstairs down to post

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:13.259
production, gathers everybody into a little room, and he says the governing body wants

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.100
to make an animated series for children, and they want to know if you can do it.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.620
And so we all looked at each other, everybody's looking around the room.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.260
Are we really going to make an animated series for children?

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.980
They really want this.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.579
Back in the 1990s, the governing body was asked if a fully animated video for children

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:32.259
could be considered.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.579
And evidently, it was not the proper time because the video was not approved.

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:44.020
But what a surprise in 2011 when the governing body approved a fully animated video series

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.619
for children.

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:51.579
The team immediately worked on creating a sample animation to show not just technically

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.100
how they could create a character in an environment, but also, more importantly, to show

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.179
how a lesson could be taught and how this could be a powerful tool.

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:05.859
The teaching committee loved it and gave full approval to produce a series.

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:14.180
Well, one clever idea was to have Caitlin portrayed as a small boy with a big, vivid imagination.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.340
The intro with the stunt plane was significant, I think, because it showed that the governing

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.219
body was sending a message to children everywhere, saying that this is for you.

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:28.140
But also said to them, this character, he's just like you.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.900
He's got an imagination, likes to play, and also just like you, he wants to be your

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.340
host's friend.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.819
Well, that first video had hard deadlines that had to be met.

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:43.379
To meet those targets, some of the brothers had to at times work for 30 hours straight

00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:44.939
on their computer.

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.540
Then they would take a nap, get back up and continue their work.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.700
But the brothers had a beautiful spirit.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.019
They told me a soldier does not work from 8 to 5.

00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:59.900
He does whatever the cause demands, Satan's at war with our children.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.379
We'll do whatever it takes to combat the devil.

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:09.979
The governing body completely shaped the teaching, the tone of this series, as you would expect.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.620
One example was in the lesson on obedience where Caleb leaves his toys out and doesn't

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.939
listen to his mom.

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:21.500
An initial idea by the team was somebody slips on a toy, knocks over a candle, curtains

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.020
catch a fire, boom, house burns to the ground.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.580
So that went to the governing body and they reviewed it and they said, well, that's pretty

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.580
scary.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.580
Try a different idea.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.060
That's a bit much.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.060
We didn't want to do anything that needlessly frighten the children.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.620
So we try to look at it from the parent perspective and some things we would not approve.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.740
Even though the governing body rejected some of the team's ideas, they made it a point

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.419
to let the team know we want these creative ideas.

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:52.340
We encouraged the creativity.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.340
And that really touched us and meant a lot to us and kept the team motivated to keep

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.659
presenting ideas.

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:05.259
We also had to plan out how translating branches would produce each of the pieces needed

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:07.060
for their DVD.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.780
As each branch had finished their DVD, we put a copy of it on our wall to track the progress.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.979
To our surprise, the wall started to fill up with discs and they spilled over to the

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:24.539
next wall and that was so encouraging for our team to see the progress.

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:30.419
So we really were excited to release it at the convention and it was amazing the work

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:31.740
that went into it.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:39.669
We were able to release it in over 130 languages the first one.

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:47.069
What's remarkable is young ones are using this tool to apply Bible principles even before

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:53.270
they're old enough to attend school and it's helping them progress to the point of baptism.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.349
Our son Markham was baptized in 2018.

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:02.669
Prior to his baptism when he was still young and learning, we were worried because Markham

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:04.389
had a problem with lying.

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:10.189
I noticed that the big green slimy things kept on growing bigger and bigger as Caleb kept

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:11.189
lying.

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:13.870
Seeing them, I had the picture of them stuck in my head.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.069
So every time I ever wanted to or felt like lying, I would imagine them behind me growing

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:23.910
bigger and bigger as well and that helped me quite a lot.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.189
After watching Caleb's father lovingly talking to Caleb and seeing Caleb listening when

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:35.430
his father used Bible characters to teach Caleb, I tried it with Sua.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.029
Sua was receptive to this method and listened well to what we wanted to teach her.

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:45.029
This made me realize how effective the videos are.

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:49.269
We are very grateful.

00:04:49.269 --> 00:04:55.550
We as parents are especially grateful to Jehovah for teaching us methods on how to raise

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.029
our children well.

00:04:57.029 --> 00:05:03.389
I want to be Jehovah's friend like mom and dad.

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:08.430
I've had the privilege over these past 10 years to be in a lot of the children.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:15.910
Some of them, when they first were being shown the videos and then grew a few years and

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:22.389
it's just a very evident Jehovah bless the project because wisdom is proved righteous

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:24.829
by its works.

00:05:24.829 --> 00:05:26.110
This has worked.
