00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:07.330
Today's text and comments highlight two subjects.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.929
One, a very important event.

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:14.810
Two, a very important quality.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.609
The event is Armageddon.

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.649
The quality is obedience.

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:23.809
So let's consider these questions.

00:00:23.809 --> 00:00:27.730
What will take place before Armageddon?

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:31.690
How do we benefit now from being obedient?

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.689
And what is the link between Armageddon and obedience?

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:41.009
Let's start with the subject of Armageddon.

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:46.530
What are some of the events that are taking place shortly

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.329
before the start of Armageddon?

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.729
Now, as explained in the Pure Worship book chapter 18,

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:59.890
after the destruction of all false religious organizations,

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.490
we, as God's servants, worldwide,

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.849
may be used by Jehovah to proclaim a final and hard-hitting

00:01:07.849 --> 00:01:10.129
judgment message.

00:01:10.129 --> 00:01:14.569
That message may announce that the political system

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:16.609
is about to end.

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:19.569
Not surprisingly, the kings of the earth

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:25.680
will not take that kindly.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.439
Ezekiel chapter 38 describes that these kings

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.120
will attack us in their role as God of Maygok.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.680
Now, since we, as God's people,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.719
live in many different countries, these kings

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:45.599
will need to work together across national borders

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:49.000
in order to attack us all at the same time.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.599
To do so, they have to combine or coalesce their efforts.

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:58.519
And that is why, in our current publications,

00:01:58.519 --> 00:02:02.599
God of Maygok is described as a combination

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:06.719
or coalition of nations.

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.879
Now, who among God's people will be attacked by God of Maygok?

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.039
Will the remaining anointed Christians still be on earth

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:18.120
and also be attacked?

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.000
The July issue of the watchtower, if 2015, stated this.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.560
Shortly before the remaining ones of the 144,000

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.919
are taken to heaven, God will attack God's people.

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:36.800
Thus, according to this watchtower,

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.879
the nations will attack us while the anointed Christians

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.199
are still on earth.

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:47.000
Now, where does the Bible confirm that statement?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.120
At Ezekiel chapter 38 verse 16, speaking about God of Maygok,

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.280
the prophecy states, like clouds covering the land,

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.360
you will come against my people Israel.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.080
Now, as our publications have long explained,

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.319
Israel here refers to spiritual Israel.

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.159
So indeed, the remnant of spiritual Israel,

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:16.479
including the brothers on the governing body at that time,

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:20.439
will be with us when this coalition attacks us.

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:23.960
Now, having these faithful brothers at our site

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.960
will certainly give us an added measure of inner calmness

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.840
and peace that will help us to get through the initial face

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.960
of the attack of that fierce coalition of nations.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.240
But then, at some point, during the attack by God of Maygok,

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.879
Jesus will send out His angels together

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:48.039
all the remaining spiritual Israelites worldwide,

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:51.400
and they will be raised to heaven.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.159
That event will mean a big change for us on earth.

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:01.680
We will face our enemies without the anointed brothers

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.639
at our site.

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:08.639
Yet, even so, according to Luke 21 verse 28,

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:14.159
we will stand up straight and lift up our heads.

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:16.680
Now, why will we not fear?

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.639
Because we know that the departure of the anointed ones

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.240
for heaven indicates that our rescue is imminent.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.839
Jesus and the angels and the 144,000 brothers of Christ

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:32.399
will form the heavenly army that comes to deliver us

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:34.639
from the coalition of nation.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.040
Now, just think about the emotions that the anointed ones

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.800
will feel for us as they come to our rescue.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.360
Many of the anointed have developed personal friendships

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.279
with us.

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:51.480
They serve together with us here at Bethel

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.920
and in the congregations where we had the privilege

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.439
of supporting them in various ways.

00:04:57.439 --> 00:05:01.240
We can just imagine how happy they will be

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.600
when they follow Jesus to deliver us.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.639
At that moment, they will have both the authority

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.680
and the power to defend those on earth

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.120
who supported them so loyally during their trials

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.519
while they were on earth.

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:22.120
No wonder that our text for today comes

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.759
from a watchtower article with the title Armageddon

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.079
is good news.

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:30.399
Yes, it is good news for all those who served Jehovah

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:33.040
in heaven and on earth.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.279
Let us now consider our second subject,

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:39.560
the quality of obedience.

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:43.720
Recently, we received a letter from the personnel committee

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.800
about the subject of obedience.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.920
Speaking about the lessons we have learned

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.279
during the lockdown, the letter stated,

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.160
perhaps the greatest thing we have learned

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.879
is the importance of obedience.

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:01.040
In this, you dear brothers and sisters

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.839
have set an outstanding example.

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:07.879
And that same warm commendation applies

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:11.879
to all faithful brothers and sisters worldwide.

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:16.319
As God's servants, we are obedient from the heart

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:19.360
as we read at Romans 6, 17.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.920
What does that mean?

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.519
We are obedient because we love Jehovah.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.079
How have we benefited from the instructions

00:06:28.079 --> 00:06:31.120
that we receive from Jehovah's organization?

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.839
A married couple in this country

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:37.480
said, following the directions we received

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:42.480
gave us peace of mind, a sister in the Philippines said,

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.480
being obedient gives me freeness of speech

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:53.079
when I teach my Bible students and give advice to my friends.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:55.560
And a brother in Peru said,

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.240
I feel now better prepared to be obedient

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.680
to instructions yet to come.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.560
Well, you will agree that these expressions reflect

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.560
how we all feel about the benefits of showing obedience.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.040
Our obedience also influences

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.600
unbelieving family members.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.439
Here's an example.

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:21.560
A sister in the United States has been serving Jehovah

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.759
for over 45 years.

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:26.800
But during all these years,

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.360
her husband did not show interest.

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:32.040
However, during the pandemic,

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.759
he noticed the loving care that the congregation

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:36.839
was showing to his family.

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:38.399
And out of appreciation,

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:40.399
the husband began to attend

00:07:40.519 --> 00:07:43.519
the congregation Zoom meetings.

00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:46.519
There, he often heard announcements from Bethel

00:07:46.519 --> 00:07:50.279
about taking safety measures to avoid getting the virus

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:52.160
and he could see how obeying

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.079
that direction safeguarded the congregation.

00:07:56.199 --> 00:08:00.000
Then one day, a non-witness relative told him,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.279
let's go out together.

00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:04.319
The husband replied,

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:09.319
I am doing nothing until Bethel says we can go.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.879
Imagine how happy the sister was

00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:15.759
when she heard her husband's reply.

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:19.040
Her son said, my dad is 83 years old,

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.560
but there is still hope for him.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.000
Now our final question.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.879
What is the link between Armageddon and obedience?

00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:34.279
Now, James chapter three for 17 helps us to find the answer.

00:08:34.279 --> 00:08:38.159
There, we read that we need to be ready to obey.

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:42.080
Now the expression ready to obey

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.480
is a translation of a Greek word that is mentioned only one time

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:51.480
in the entire New World translation here at James 317.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.919
A person who is ready to obey

00:08:55.919 --> 00:08:59.000
is quick to change his opinion

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.399
when he is presented with facts that correct his thinking.

00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:05.639
It is someone who is known for his willingness

00:09:05.639 --> 00:09:07.600
to get along with others.

00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:11.240
Now interestingly, in the first century,

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:16.240
the same Greek word was also used in a military setting.

00:09:17.039 --> 00:09:21.480
Bible scholars mentioned that Flavius Josephus,

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:25.279
the Jewish historian, used that same word

00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:29.960
to describe obedient soldiers in the Roman army.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.240
In fact, Josephus wrote that one of the reasons

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.000
why the Roman army was so successful was

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
that the soldiers were well trained ready to obey.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.759
Now how does that apply to us?

00:09:43.759 --> 00:09:46.399
Well, of course, we do not use literal weapons

00:09:46.399 --> 00:09:48.360
as soldiers do still.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.120
There is a similarity between those Roman soldiers

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.200
in the past and us today.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:59.200
We too have to be well trained and ready to obey.

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:01.360
Why?

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.480
Because the obedience that we develop today

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.120
will help us to obey life-saving instructions

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:12.919
that we will receive from God's organization in the future.

00:10:12.919 --> 00:10:14.600
When the nations attack us

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.080
and the war of Armageddon follows,

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:21.200
showing obedience will be our protection.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:26.120
So what were the main points of our brief discussion?

00:10:27.039 --> 00:10:29.559
Shortly before Armageddon,

00:10:29.559 --> 00:10:33.879
we will face the attack of a coalition of nations.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:39.720
Today's circumstances allow us to train ourselves

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.039
in being obedient.

00:10:42.039 --> 00:10:45.120
And as Armageddon comes closer,

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:50.120
we will be protected as long as we are ready to obey.
