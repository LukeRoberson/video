00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:08.019
Our tongue can detect five basic tastes.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:23.899
There is sweet, salty, sour, bitter,

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:28.899
and the rich savoury taste called umami.

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:34.240
But we enjoy not just five flavors,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:40.829
but possibly over a hundred thousand.

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:41.829
How?

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.829
As we chew, we also smell our food.

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.619
Chewing releases aromas that pass up into our nose

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:54.619
through the back of our throat.

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:59.619
Taste and smell then combine to make the flavors we enjoy.

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:11.459
Our taste buds develop before we're born.

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:16.739
As an unborn baby swallows amniotic fluid,

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:18.739
it may taste what its mother eats,

00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:24.590
and is more likely to enjoy the same food she does.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.989
We don't eat just to survive.

00:01:31.989 --> 00:01:34.989
We love to eat.

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:36.989
It makes us happy.

00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:43.890
The Bible says why?

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.640
That everyone should eat and drink

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.640
and find enjoyment for all his hard work.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.640
It is the gift of God.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:15.759
Our world is full of sounds.

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:28.349
Some are natural.

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:38.969
Others we create.

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:42.969
We can hear music before we're born.

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:48.729
And can develop a love of music as we grow.

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:51.729
We can compose music.

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:54.729
Be moved by it.

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:57.729
And replay it in our minds.

00:02:57.729 --> 00:03:01.729
Musical instruments typically combine a sound generator

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:04.729
which produces tones with a resonator,

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:08.729
such as wood or metal, which adds volume.

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:12.729
The design resembles our own vocal organs.

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:21.139
But few instruments compare to the beauty of the human voice.

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:24.139
Our hearing complements the voice.

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:30.629
We can listen to things that draw us closer to God

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:38.069
and use the voice He gave us to praise Him with joy.

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.069
Praise, John, for Jehovah is good.

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.069
Sing praise us to His name.

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.069
For it is pleasant.
