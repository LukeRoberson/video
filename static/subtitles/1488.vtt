WEBVTT

00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:09.769
Now we invite you to enjoy a special presentation that highlights the relocation of headquarters

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:12.769
from Brooklyn to Warwick.

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:40.560
We'd like to let you know that the governing body has decided that if the approvals are

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:48.280
received for the Warwick project, we will be moving completely out of Brooklyn.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.179
The World Headquarters will be relocated at Warwick.

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:58.299
Jehovah is telling us, through the governing body, it's time to move out of Brooklyn.

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:02.619
The governing body, these brothers, as soon as they see Jehovah's direction, they just

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:03.619
move.

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:08.219
It doesn't matter if it's long-held, cherished ideas, this is the way it has to be done.

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:10.700
As soon as they see Jehovah's direction, it's done.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.700
Jehovah had everything control.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.299
He just kept nudging in perfect humans.

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:20.129
He knew where he wanted us and then we end up where we're supposed to be.

00:01:20.129 --> 00:01:25.569
In the world, actually, they can accomplish projects quickly.

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:32.450
They basically say, time is of the essence and they mean it.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.890
Cost has to be almost not a consideration.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.849
People are not a consideration.

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:48.140
Jehovah's organization is different.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:55.060
What made Warwick project different than all the others and Jehovah knew is the fact

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.140
that he realized that we needed constant spiritual food.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.659
We would arrive on our buses, arrive in our vans, and we would go to morning worship.

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.020
The spirituality of the family really made this a theocratic project that stood out

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.460
in the minds of many.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.139
The outside contractors there, they noticed that we were putting spiritual things before

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:22.900
physical things and they commented on that, while we arrive and get right to work, you

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.620
arrive and you worship your God.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.060
The branch committee contacted four of us to set up a team to do the move out from Brooklyn

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.219
to Warwick.

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:39.939
Now it became the reality of a completely clearing out and I mean, that's everything.

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:44.379
That was a pretty daunting thing because when people want to buy your properties, they

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.780
want to take possession right away.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.580
There are six buildings that are connected through tunnels underground and so if a buyer

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.340
is not interested in purchasing multiple buildings, the sale of the properties are going

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.219
to disconnect those tunnels.

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:03.300
New York City law requires we fill those up with concrete.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.099
We didn't anticipate that.

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.819
Once we fill those tunnels, that cuts off the utilities to the rest of the buildings.

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.500
So how do you heat the other buildings?

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.860
How do you keep their electricity, the communication going?

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.020
When can you shut it off?

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.500
When will the people be moving?

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.139
Those are all the logistics that came into question and that we had to work through.

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:27.580
When we look at the work, it's like an iceberg, 16 properties damped, 1.6 million square

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.259
feet, over 2,000 individuals to get moved out in 13 months.

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:36.819
Take that and look at 70 departments and you start to get a picture of the growth of the

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.060
job already expanded.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.099
If you shut down this service to the Bethel family because you're moving that department,

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:49.259
you still have maybe 1,500 to 1,200 people relying on that type of service so now you put

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:50.900
in a temporary service.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.219
But if you locate it in the wrong location, well now that can hinder the operation of

00:03:55.219 --> 00:04:01.740
the move out so you have to know where to put it so your job just grows again.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:08.699
The process starts many months even more than a year previous as you identify who from

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:10.340
departments are coming.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.379
You realize that in this department is perhaps a husband, but in the southern department

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:19.339
is a wife and they're scheduled for two different times so now how do you make that work?

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:22.899
Do we have the support system in place in order to handle both of those assignments at

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:24.139
the same time?

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.980
Those logistics are all part of the process that we had to go through at the same time.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.339
You're planning for two things, not one or sometimes even three because at the same time

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:37.220
when we were ramping up the movement into Warwick, the construction family was leaving.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.579
So all that was part of it.

00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:41.819
Then it was just a matter of making sure that we could schedule all the moves in the necessary

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:42.819
time.

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:47.339
The other side, once you start moving out of Brooklyn, once we began the move out of Brooklyn

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:52.100
and every building that got sold, someone had to go in and clean the place, everything

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.339
has to be cleared out.

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:58.220
So the collaboration between departments has been really nice to see.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.699
When we would come in and start to speak with groups, they're 100% cooperative.

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.339
Then they want to know how can they help, what can they do?

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:08.980
Are there other areas that they could help out other departments?

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.060
So it was not a, this is my department and I'm going to protect everything.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.699
It is more, this is the arrangement.

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:17.100
How can we help out?

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:22.019
A move that size, we couldn't do it on our own.

00:05:22.019 --> 00:05:26.779
So we had a help of the furniture moving department, brothers, even at the other sides in

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:33.100
Patterson and Wallkill in those libraries that helped us to pack and somehow to extract

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.220
books that we needed in our main library.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:42.339
As we have, I would say, some 65,000 books at least counting.

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:47.540
The main repository, really, for research are our books' writers.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.540
They have to work.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.139
They can't just say, okay, now for two months, I won't do anything.

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:58.779
Thanks to all those moving, they did a wonderful job helping us out without them.

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:06.959
I think we still would be in Brooklyn counting out our books.

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:12.639
A lot of things going to moving, the broadcasting department, even in just the studio, the number

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:17.680
of departments that have assisted in some way is staggering and really there's no other

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:25.920
way it could have gotten done without the help of all those different brothers and sisters.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.160
We got contacted by the Brooklyn Heights Association.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.079
They wanted to know how is this move going to happen.

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:34.000
Brooklyn is very complicated.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.079
There's traffic everywhere, people crossing a sidewalk, trying to get around buses, construction

00:06:41.079 --> 00:06:43.639
right behind the office building here.

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:48.639
So they were very appreciative of how we had it organized, how we'd already communicated

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:52.920
with the police on what we were doing, and how we were going to handle it.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:07:00.600
So it was sort of an unexpected, but we saw Jehovah's Blessing in that activity as well.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.680
The older ones in Bethel were the ones who set the pace for us.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.720
The things we learned from them, they're work ethic, they're broad view of the worldwide

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.040
field.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.600
It, to me, is what our organization is about.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:20.439
And so for me, it's extremely gratifying to be able to help.

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:24.959
They nervous yes, but really they are faithful and want to work along with Jehovah's

00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:29.290
organization, so they've been very cooperative.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:32.889
When you have a lot of people helping you, you can't go wrong.

00:07:32.889 --> 00:07:35.649
They know me like the back of their hands.

00:07:35.649 --> 00:07:39.209
But we've laughed about it, and we're all happy.

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:43.970
And they're providing us a lot of assistance in whatever we're doing, and I love them

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:44.970
for that.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:50.410
It's encouraging to see those ones do that, set some nice example for the rest of us.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:54.410
So some have asked me the question, what was the difference between warwick and all the

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:58.370
other construction projects that you did under the U.S. branch?

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.089
This one was a little unique.

00:08:00.089 --> 00:08:05.610
There was a need for great communication, not good communication, great communication.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.569
We had to trust our brothers and sisters.

00:08:08.569 --> 00:08:12.970
Implicit trust, we had to yield to other departments.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:18.689
I think it's only been a training ground, really, for Jesus Christ, to use it, to teach

00:08:18.689 --> 00:08:28.019
people, and to teach us skills that we're going to use for an eternity.

00:08:28.019 --> 00:08:33.659
I think it has made a great impression on all those who have had the privilege of working

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:34.659
on it.

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:42.019
Most of the Bethel family makes the move out of Brooklyn, and begins to inhabit warwick.

00:08:42.019 --> 00:08:45.379
That's when you're going to see some significant changes.

00:08:45.379 --> 00:08:49.539
I am looking forward to the effect that it has on the brotherhood.

00:08:49.539 --> 00:08:53.299
Everywhere we go around the world, that's one of the first questions people ask is how

00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:54.299
is warwick?

00:08:54.299 --> 00:08:56.100
We're planning to come to warwick.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.059
We want to come see it.

00:08:58.059 --> 00:09:03.019
And when they come and they see the beautiful surroundings, when they see what is there

00:09:03.019 --> 00:09:08.259
of the museum that will be there, it is really going to touch many people.

00:09:08.259 --> 00:09:13.860
As we look to the future, we have no idea, but we know that Jehovah has amazing things

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:14.860
in store.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:21.419
When you see an organization like this, come together to accomplish a common goal.

00:09:21.419 --> 00:09:23.860
You know it can only be done by Jehovah.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:30.860
It touches your heart, it touches your faith, it helps you to really see that, yes, Jehovah

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:49.649
is running this organization, and his earthly part of the organization is amazing.

00:09:49.649 --> 00:09:56.889
When we think about this first morning worship from our beautiful new headquarters, the

00:09:56.889 --> 00:10:03.889
governing body thought it would be appropriate to provide an open letter to thank all who

00:10:03.889 --> 00:10:10.409
have shared the hard work that went into this project, how we appreciate it.

00:10:10.409 --> 00:10:17.620
But permit me, please, to read this open letter from the governing body.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:24.259
Dear brothers, on behalf of the warwick Bethel family, the governing body would like to

00:10:24.259 --> 00:10:32.659
express deep appreciation for our lovely new home here at Warwick Bethel.

00:10:32.659 --> 00:10:41.860
How we love our new residences and offices, the fresh air, quiet environment, and beautiful

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:48.460
scenery are already having a beneficial effect on how we feel.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:54.419
We are a covenant that now with Jehovah's blessing and help, we will be able to work

00:10:54.419 --> 00:11:01.379
even harder and accomplish even more in behalf of kingdom and trists.

00:11:01.379 --> 00:11:07.779
Even though we do not deserve such a wonderful place to live and work, we truly appreciate

00:11:07.779 --> 00:11:17.419
this generous expression of Jehovah's undeserved kindness, 1 Peter 4, 10.

00:11:17.419 --> 00:11:24.259
We are most grateful to Jehovah for the more than 27,000 different brothers and sisters

00:11:24.259 --> 00:11:28.700
who volunteered to work on the construction of this project.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:34.700
Many of you dear friends took vacation time, paid your own transportation costs, lived

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:40.820
in small rooms, and got up very early in the morning to ride buses or shuttles to the

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:41.980
work site.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:49.700
Then, you worked tirelessly in all kinds of weather, putting your heart into supporting

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:53.299
this Theocratic Building project.

00:11:53.299 --> 00:11:57.980
Many of you accepted multiple invitations to work here.

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:04.019
Unquestionably, Jehovah loves you very much for what you have done.

00:12:04.019 --> 00:12:10.059
Please be assured that the governing body loves you very much too.

00:12:10.059 --> 00:12:20.139
To borrow Paul's words to the Thessalonians, you have become so beloved to us, 1 Thessalonians

00:12:20.139 --> 00:12:22.379
to 8.

00:12:22.379 --> 00:12:28.139
In addition to those who shared in the actual construction work, countless other dear

00:12:28.139 --> 00:12:35.500
brothers and sisters supported this project from afar, self-sacrificing wives back their

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.860
husbands' participation.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:42.100
Diligent remote workers lent a hand.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:49.379
Generous publishers assisted financially and other loyal ones encouraged and provided

00:12:49.379 --> 00:12:56.299
practical help to those who were able to work at the Warwick site.

00:12:56.299 --> 00:13:03.379
Being on those who helped from far away reminds us of 1 Samuel 3024.

00:13:03.379 --> 00:13:10.220
God's Word tells us that the ones who stayed behind with a baggage received the same share

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:15.139
as the ones who went into battle.

00:13:15.139 --> 00:13:20.259
Even though we do not personally know the vast majority of you brothers and sisters who

00:13:20.259 --> 00:13:28.659
have supported this project, for a certainty, Jehovah knows each and every one of you.

00:13:28.659 --> 00:13:36.139
As Hebrews 610 assures, God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you

00:13:36.139 --> 00:13:42.179
showed for His name by ministering to the holy ones.

00:13:42.179 --> 00:13:46.019
Jehovah expects us to give Him our best.

00:13:46.019 --> 00:13:50.059
That is why He found Cain's sacrifice displeasing.

00:13:50.059 --> 00:13:53.500
He knew that Cain could have done better.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.600
Genesis 4.5

00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:03.860
But like Abel, you dear friends of given Jehovah your best, we are confident that you will

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:10.980
continue to show your wholehearted love for Jehovah in harmony with your circumstances.

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:16.220
Genesis 4.4, Matthew 22, 37

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:21.179
Additionally, the governing body would like to thank from the bottom of our heart the

00:14:21.179 --> 00:14:28.899
five brothers who served on the Warwick Construction Project Committee for their inexhaustible

00:14:28.899 --> 00:14:32.340
labors of love.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:39.379
We also want to thank profusely the many Bethelites who work shoulder to shoulder with us in connection

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:43.139
with this massive theocratic endeavor.

00:14:43.139 --> 00:14:45.639
Zephaniah 39

00:14:45.639 --> 00:14:51.940
Included are the brothers on the United States Branch Committee and the hard working brothers

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:59.539
and sisters in the furniture moving department, the maintenance department, the computer department,

00:14:59.539 --> 00:15:06.179
the broadcasting department, the transportation department, and the Bethel office who are still

00:15:06.179 --> 00:15:15.620
carrying out the gigantic task of moving the Bethel family from Brooklyn to Warwick.

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:23.100
We would certainly be remiss if we failed to thank also the thousands upon thousands of

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:30.379
devoted brothers and sisters who labored on the project at Warkill.

00:15:30.379 --> 00:15:34.259
That too was a massive undertaking.

00:15:34.259 --> 00:15:40.740
Please, Jehovah bless the willing spirit that you dear ones have shown.

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:46.700
In the Bible, sometimes the thought is repeated three times for emphasis.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:57.019
In this vein, we say, thank you, thank you, thank you to all who have helped us and are

00:15:57.019 --> 00:16:05.179
continuing to help us bring this wonderful theocratic project at headquarters to completion.

00:16:05.179 --> 00:16:12.299
May Jehovah reward you for what you have done and may there be a perfect wage for you

00:16:12.299 --> 00:16:20.179
from Jehovah, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to seek refuge.

00:16:20.179 --> 00:16:22.500
You too, twelve.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:33.059
We express our warm love and affection for all of you, your brothers governing body of

00:16:33.059 --> 00:16:34.259
Jehovah's Witnesses.
