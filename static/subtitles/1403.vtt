00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.280
Give me a truth.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.680
I'm sorry, what?

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.040
Your science says learn Bible truth.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.439
So I assume you're here to share said truth, so share one.

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.959
My name's Nita, what's yours?

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:56.040
Jade.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.239
Like the stone?

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:03.219
No, like I'm jaded.

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:06.379
Are you going to share something or what?

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:08.139
Um, yeah.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.539
Did you know the Bible says you can live forever?

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:14.860
Heaven, that's what you're sharing.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.419
That's not exactly new, is it?

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:20.340
No, I mean, did you know the Bible says you can live forever on earth?

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.060
But why would I want that?

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.740
This place is a mess.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.539
But it won't be in the future.

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:29.900
Revelation 21 verse 4 promises.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.379
And tea will wipe out every tear from their eyes.

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.740
And death will be no more.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.860
Neither will morning, nor outcry, nor pain be anymore.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.580
The former things have passed away.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:50.569
Since there's no death or pain in heaven, where would this promise apply?

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.870
The earth.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.819
I didn't know the Bible said that.

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.580
Wicked.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.020
I mean, that's cool.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.500
Oh, OK.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.580
Would you like to learn how to be part of that future?

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.500
Uh, yeah.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.020
Thanks.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.780
I'm not really the cheque type.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.259
And I'm late.

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:14.900
So see you later.
