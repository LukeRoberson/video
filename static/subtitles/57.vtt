00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:07.980
Welcome to this month's broadcast. Here are a few highlights of what we'll enjoy on the program.

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.300
What if changing circumstances in the family begin pushing mates apart emotionally?

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.660
This dramatization of Sean and Chiara may provide some timely guidance.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:27.100
Also, the story of Grace Lee will be an encouragement to any who have faced severe emotional

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:33.020
challenges for taking a stand for the truth. You'll see the effect that her actions had on those

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:40.939
around her. And this month's music video will reassure us of the love, kindness, and support we

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:51.100
enjoy as Jehovah's people. All that and more on this February 2019 edition of JW Broadcasting.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.879
The theme of this program is taken from the second part of Romans 1210.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:23.200
And showing honor to one another, take the lead. What is honor? In the Hebrew scriptures,

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.879
the term translated honor literally means heaviness. So when we honor someone, we're acknowledging

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:37.439
that he's weighty or that he mounts to something. In the Greek scriptures, the word is related to

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.200
setting a price on something, meaning that the one we honor is esteemed or has value.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:53.280
Who should we honor? Of course, Jehovah is worthy of honor. Revelation chapter 4 verse 11 says this

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:02.079
and gives us the reason for giving glory and honor to Jehovah. It says because he created all things.

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.120
He is responsible for us having life in the first place.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:16.000
How do we give him honor? There are many ways that we honor him by doing his will or being his

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.879
laws and principles. We honor him by extolling his qualities and promises, telling others about

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:30.080
these gifts from God. We show him honor by contributing financially to the worldwide educational

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:38.960
work that he's directing through his son and Holy Spirit. And just as Revelation chapter 4 said

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:47.840
about Jehovah being worthy of the honor, Revelation chapter 5 verse 12 says that his son Christ Jesus

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:56.719
is worthy of the same. Verse 12 says of Jesus, they were saying with a loud voice, the lamb who

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:03.280
was slaughtered is worthy to receive the power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:11.759
glory and blessing. How do we show honor to Jesus? One way is acknowledged in the verse we just read.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.240
He was slaughtered like a sacrificial lamb so that we might have the hope of everlasting life.

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:26.240
We highly esteem and value that sacrifice. We honor Jesus by recognizing his role as an immortal

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:33.520
king of kings in the heavens. And another very practical way to honor Jesus is to strive to imitate

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:41.120
his life and personality as the model for us to follow closely. If we take the lead in showing honor,

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:49.599
who else will we view as highly valued to be treated with esteem? Ephesians 6 1 and 2 says that

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:57.599
children honor their father and mother when they're obedient to them. Matthew 15 4 through 6 makes it

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:04.080
clear that adult children honor their parents and grandparents by giving material assistance to them

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:13.759
as needed. Verse 25 verse 17 urges us to give elders double honor because of their hard work in our

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:22.399
behalf. Romans 13 1 and 7 even extends the matter of showing honor to governmental rulers and

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:31.439
others in authority. Verse 22 verse 17 broadens the meaning of honor even further saying honor

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:39.439
men of all sorts. In addition to being kind and respectful to people in general, we also honor

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:47.920
them by being willing to spend time sharing the good news with them. Ephesians 5 22 through 25 appeals to

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:55.839
wives to honor their husbands by having Christ-like subjection for them. Husbands are to honor their

00:04:55.839 --> 00:05:03.439
wives by showing them love and treating them just as Jesus treated the congregation. And what about

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:10.079
our theme text for this discussion? Who was Paul addressing in Romans chapter 12 when he said

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:20.639
and showing honor to one another take the lead? Who hardly one another in that verse? Look at Romans

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:30.160
chapter 1 and verse 7 with me. Paul says he's writing to all those who are in Rome as God's beloved

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:37.759
ones call to be holy ones. So all of us in the Christian congregation are to have honor for each

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:46.399
other. I'd like to spend the balance of my time discussing two of the many opportunities we have to

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:54.879
show honor. They're the last two that I just referenced. First, marriage mates showing honor to

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:03.040
each other and second showing honor to one another in our congregations. Marriage is in general today

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:10.399
are seriously lacking in honor. Marriage mates often demean one another with harsh words and

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:17.759
disrespectful attitudes. Some in the world resort to physical violence as if that somehow makes the

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:25.360
abusive one right in his view of what the issue is. An infidelity part of one or both mates is so

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:34.319
common. It doesn't even raise eyebrows anymore. All of this is a gross lack of honor and marriage.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:43.519
But what about marriages of those professing to be Jehovah's Witnesses? We're blessed with so many

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:52.000
marriages that are wholesome and honorable true none are perfect. But how blessed we are to have the

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.639
truth and to have learned to be more and more Christlike with each other. We've learned to shed

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:06.879
things we heard when we're growing up. However, the matter of honoring our marriage mate needs to be

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:13.759
discussed. While relatively few of our marriages end up with some kind of physical violence and

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:22.959
relatively few end up in divorce, what about having honor in the marriage? After living together as

00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:29.839
husband or wife for many months or for years or even for decades familiarity can cause us to treat

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:39.120
each other with less respect or honor than when we were courting. That isn't right. It isn't Christlike.

00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:46.959
But with our inherited imperfection, we may succumb to dishonable words and behavior with the one

00:07:46.959 --> 00:07:55.839
we promised to treasure until death do us part. How can we get a grip on this trait and minimize the

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:05.759
times that we have a clash of spirit and words? First, let's consider the two basic responsibilities

00:08:05.759 --> 00:08:12.000
assigned to marriage mates. This is the foundation that we can then build on to improve.

00:08:14.579 --> 00:08:20.660
The role of the husbands clearly stated at 1 Corinthians chapter 11 and verse 3,

00:08:21.379 --> 00:08:28.339
while some wives in society made bristle at this thought, why serving Jehovah are to embrace this

00:08:28.339 --> 00:08:35.940
thought? It's the arrangement of God. 1 Corinthians chapter 11 and verse 3 says,

00:08:37.379 --> 00:08:42.259
but I want you to know that the head of every man is the Christ and turn the head of a woman as the

00:08:42.259 --> 00:08:50.580
man and turn the head of the Christ is God. God's Word says that the head of a woman is the man

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:59.539
however, the head of the woman is not to be a domineering man, not an abuse of man verbally or

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:07.059
physically. He used to imitate his head and who was that? What did the first part of the verse say?

00:09:07.779 --> 00:09:17.539
They head of every man is the Christ. In fact, Ephesians chapter 5 strikes this fine balance between

00:09:18.259 --> 00:09:25.139
being ahead of the wife and being a loving head like the Christ. Ephesians 5, 22 and 23 says,

00:09:26.659 --> 00:09:33.299
let wise be in subjection to their husbands as to the Lord. What of the disposition of the husband?

00:09:34.659 --> 00:09:40.259
Because a husband is head of his wife just as the Christ is head of the congregation,

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:51.860
he being a savior of this body. That verse says it all. Verse 33 of the same chapter says this,

00:09:52.980 --> 00:10:00.259
each one of you must love his wife as he does himself. On the other hand, the wife should have

00:10:00.259 --> 00:10:09.940
deep respect for her husband. There's nowhere in God's Word that says that if one mate pushes the

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:16.259
other mate's button emotionally, that it cancels the offended mate's obligation to be Christ-like.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:25.700
The problem is that when one mate is offended or hurt, it's so easy to roll the eyes and discuss

00:10:26.419 --> 00:10:33.220
or to lash back with a verbal insult. Then the other mate fires back with another harsh cutting

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:40.659
remark. It's like when on a forest fire, temper's blaze in the evening goes up and smoke.

00:10:42.179 --> 00:10:50.899
It's not at all Christ-like. There's no honor shown in such a conflagration. It has to stop

00:10:50.899 --> 00:11:03.299
sooner rather than later. The January 15th 2015 issue of the Watchtower said this, remember that marriage

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:10.100
is not a competition to find out who is stronger, who can shout louder, or who can think of the most

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:18.500
cutting remark. True, we all have flaws and sometimes we upset others, but there is never a

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:25.620
justifiable reason for either a husband or a wife to use sarcastic in demeaning speech or worse

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:36.259
to shove or hit each other. How can we change the atmosphere? Someone needs to put out the fire

00:11:36.259 --> 00:11:45.139
with the water of God's Word. Romans 12, 10, and the bead part again, in showing honor to one

00:11:45.139 --> 00:11:54.500
other, take the lead. One of the mates must take the lead, even if at the time they're apologizing

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:59.220
for their own behavior, acknowledging that they didn't respond in a Christ-like way, saying,

00:12:00.419 --> 00:12:09.889
forgive me. That same issue of the Watchtower cited two scriptures, one for the husband and one for

00:12:09.889 --> 00:12:21.009
the wife. We'll first read Proverbs 17, verse 27. Husbands, listen to this and apply it prior to a

00:12:21.009 --> 00:12:30.370
rift or even during the conflict, Proverbs 17, 27. A man of knowledge restrains his words

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:44.379
and a discerning man will remain calm. Husbands, does that describe us? Now wives, please locate

00:12:44.379 --> 00:12:53.860
Proverbs 31, 26. Does this describe your speech even when some altercation occurs?

00:12:54.820 --> 00:13:04.580
Proverbs 31, 26. She opens her mouth in wisdom. The law of kindness is on her tongue. Usually after

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:13.220
a misunderstanding and rash words have been said, we feel miserable and upset. We often chastise

00:13:13.379 --> 00:13:19.860
ourselves or adding fuel to the fire. How much better to train ourselves to restrain our words

00:13:20.419 --> 00:13:29.940
and remain calm and to speak in wisdom and with kindness of tongue? Meet Emil and Ferruca

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:36.500
Garbovan from Romania. Their good examples of how the power of God's word can mold and change

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.259
the attitudes of marriage mates, willing to be guided by it.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:54.740
In 1983, when I met Ferruca, I already had two little girls. One was seven years old and the

00:13:54.740 --> 00:14:01.460
other one was three. I accepted to study the Bible. My husband worked as a warrant officer for

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:07.539
the police, so at the beginning I studied in secret. Then I decided to tell him the truth.

00:14:08.259 --> 00:14:16.659
When I found out that my wife was studying the Bible in order to become one of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:25.620
I became very sad and I realised that our marriage, our family was in danger because I only knew

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:37.779
bad things about Jehovah's Witnesses. He threatened, he would divorce me and he did. The divorce

00:14:37.779 --> 00:14:44.179
was a very difficult time in my life because I was seven months pregnant with our third daughter.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:51.620
Following the divorce, my husband was given the house and the custody of our two daughters.

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:59.730
I had to leave the house and I stayed for almost a year with two families of our brothers.

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:11.070
I saw Jehovah's love towards me and I loved Jehovah very much, but I loved my husband too.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:21.899
One day, as I was walking and holding the little girl's hand, I saw Ferruca's husband

00:15:21.899 --> 00:15:30.299
walking toward me. My heart stopped and I said to myself, he is going to hit me.

00:15:31.419 --> 00:15:36.299
But Emil was a gentleman and he took the little girl in his arms,

00:15:37.179 --> 00:15:42.539
talked to her for a few minutes and then he put her back down and left.

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:49.340
When I saw him leaving, I thanked Jehovah because he didn't beat me.

00:15:51.549 --> 00:15:59.950
In 1990, I looked for my wife and I told her that I would like to remarry her, to reunite our family.

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:06.269
And after a while, she agreed and step by step I started to study.

00:16:06.429 --> 00:16:12.269
In 2003, I became one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:19.549
I am very happy that I made this change and I regret that I didn't do it sooner.

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:29.220
I personally saw how the truth can change a person's life, even in my own family.

00:16:31.919 --> 00:16:37.519
Currently, I serve as an elder and in 2010, I became a regular pioneer.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:46.980
When I see Emil conduct the Bible study next to me, feel like kneeling rather than standing

00:16:47.779 --> 00:16:58.019
to thank Jehovah. So to married couples who loved Jehovah, we repeat. And showing honor,

00:16:58.019 --> 00:17:04.259
take the lead. The principles of just discussed can also be applied when showing honor

00:17:04.259 --> 00:17:09.059
to others in the congregation. Like the husband and wife that we just discussed,

00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:15.779
all of us should be improving in imitating Jesus and in following his steps closely

00:17:15.779 --> 00:17:19.779
in all of our interactions with fellow believers in the congregation.

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:28.500
How do we show honor to one another? One way is well described at 1 Corinthians 10 verse 23

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:35.859
and verse 24. We show honor when we put the other person's feelings and needs ahead of our own.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:44.980
1 Corinthians 10, 23 and 24. All things are lawful, but not all things are advantageous.

00:17:45.779 --> 00:17:53.059
All things are lawful, but not all things build up. Let each one keep seeking not his own advantage,

00:17:53.779 --> 00:17:59.460
but that of the other person. We show honor when we suppress our own rights.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.900
What we do or say might be lawful, but is it advantageous?

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:14.339
Will it build up? Verse 24 then concisely says it. Keep seeking not our own advantage or right,

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:23.700
but that of the other person. We show honor to others when we do good deeds for them. Possibly it's

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:30.180
even a humble task that an elderly publisher needs done. It could be offering to clean the house,

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:37.299
take them to the store or fill some other need. The principal is at Luke 22 verse 26.

00:18:38.019 --> 00:18:43.700
You though are not to be that way, but let the one who is the greatest among you become as the

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:53.059
youngest and the one taking the lead as the one ministering. Earlier, I cited 1 Timothy 517

00:18:53.059 --> 00:18:58.420
where we're urged to give elders double honor because of their hard work in our behalf.

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:05.380
They're also part of our congregation and deserve honor. In our August program last year,

00:19:06.019 --> 00:19:11.779
brother let helped us consider much of what is involved. You'll recall that his subject was

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:20.819
appreciating our gifts in men. We minister to or honor others when we readily forgive them if

00:19:20.819 --> 00:19:28.180
they've embarrassed us or heard our feelings. Overall, Jehovah's people do quite well in honoring

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:36.500
one another in the congregation. But here's the question, are we improving in this aspect of our

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:45.220
Christian personality? In our theme scripture, Paul didn't just say to honor one another. He said

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:54.099
to why not or reach out in this aspect of our Christian life. His words were to take the lead.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:20:00.819
If Paul had just said to show honor to each other, that would be like a teacher urging a group

00:20:00.819 --> 00:20:07.380
of literate students to learn to read. If they're literate, they don't need to learn to read.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:14.500
But what might be the teacher urging them to do? He might encourage them to read better

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:23.700
or to improve. Love is the identifying mark of Christ's disciples. So honor is something we've

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:31.539
learned to show. However, like the teacher, Paul is urging us to improve in this area.

00:20:32.259 --> 00:20:39.380
He said, take the lead in showing honor. The footnote says this could be rendered taking the

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:47.539
initiative in showing honor. Instead of waiting for some obvious reason to do good for others to

00:20:47.539 --> 00:20:54.579
commend someone to check on a shut-in, look for opportunities to take the initiative to show honor

00:20:54.579 --> 00:21:06.339
in the family and in our congregations. Yes, in showing honor, take the lead. At times,

00:21:07.539 --> 00:21:13.619
changing circumstances can make it challenging to show honor. In this dramatization,

00:21:14.339 --> 00:21:20.019
note how the husband and wife adjusted to a change while learning new ways to continue showing

00:21:20.019 --> 00:21:40.849
love and honor to each other. My name is Kiera and that's my husband, Sean. Our son,

00:21:40.849 --> 00:21:48.289
a kill moved out recently to help where the need is greater. I didn't realize just how much he

00:21:48.289 --> 00:22:01.359
made us laugh. I miss that. It's just more quiet now. But more than that,

00:22:03.279 --> 00:22:26.289
I felt we were growing apart. I tried talking to him. It didn't go well.

00:22:45.599 --> 00:23:37.809
Ever since I key left, things have been off between Kiera and I. She is so serious now.

00:23:38.769 --> 00:23:49.279
I wish she would just lighten up and laugh more. Like when our kill was still here, as much as I hated to

00:23:49.279 --> 00:24:02.779
admit it, it felt like we were growing apart. Even our kill noticed. Anyway, could I ask you guys a

00:24:02.779 --> 00:24:11.099
question? Are you both doing okay? Because you don't look okay. Of course, we're okay. We're

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:24.240
doing wonderful, right? Yeah, we're doing good. We weren't fooling anyone, except maybe ourselves.

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:33.700
And for the first time, we both revealed to each other just how we had been really feeling.

00:24:36.769 --> 00:24:48.859
We knew we were headed down a dangerous path. We had to do something fast. We read aloud the

00:24:48.859 --> 00:24:57.099
scripture at Romans 12 and 10 in showing honor to one another. Take the lead.

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:07.339
We thought about Abraham and Sarah. They weren't perfect. But they worked hard to show honor to

00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:25.740
each other by listening and by caring. I told Kiera, I know I can do better and I want to.

00:25:25.740 --> 00:26:25.099
Because I love her so much. I told Sean, let's both try to do better. So we did. Once later,

00:26:25.099 --> 00:26:34.460
we decided to pioneer together. Now, it seemed we had a lot to talk about. I felt like I was seeing a

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:44.029
whole new side of Kiera. Like Abraham and Sarah, our marriage wasn't perfect. There's going to be

00:26:44.029 --> 00:26:52.109
stressful times. But by working hard to apply Bible principles, we got through that rough patch.

00:26:53.069 --> 00:27:03.420
And it drew us even closer together. First Corinthians 13 verses 4 and 7 tells us

00:27:04.299 --> 00:27:10.619
love is patient and kind and bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things,

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:17.339
endures all things. Our dramatization helped us see how love can adapt to changing needs and

00:27:17.339 --> 00:27:23.339
circumstances. But wouldn't it be nice to talk with some real life examples of those who have

00:27:23.339 --> 00:27:31.579
developed such skills? Well, we have a special treat. A long time faithful couple has joined us

00:27:31.579 --> 00:27:38.940
in the studio. William and Angela Samuelson who served Patterson Beffel in the United States.

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:46.380
Now, of course, normally each other for decades. And I know he was Bill and Angie. So that's

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:50.539
what we refer to him. So nice that you could be here and be interviewed.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:59.180
What's helped you both maintain a happy marriage? Well, we work as a team. So we always check with

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:05.660
each other before making decisions, even in areas where we wouldn't necessarily have to. It would

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:11.579
be okay to go ahead. But just out of respect, we talk with each other about any decisions that we

00:28:11.579 --> 00:28:18.700
make. And you know, Brother Morris, we've been married 60 years now. And we've never really had a

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:26.619
real serious argument. We've had some disagreements, but nothing ever serious. And whenever we have

00:28:26.619 --> 00:28:34.059
those kind of words, well, we never use demeaning language or say derogatory things about each other.

00:28:34.619 --> 00:28:41.180
That makes me very happy. That's commendable. Early in our marriage, there was one occasion.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:47.660
When Angie was upset with me about something, it could have been anything. But in the conversation,

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:53.740
it obviously showed in her tonal voice. So I explained to her that she could say anything she wanted

00:28:54.380 --> 00:29:00.859
as long as she smiled when she said it. Well, she tried. And we both had a good laugh.

00:29:01.819 --> 00:29:08.460
Very hard to stay mad when you're smiling. Very good advice. What about in the congregation,

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:15.420
have you been able to show each other on or there? Well, when we have assignments from the platform,

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:24.859
either of us, we work together. Angie is much better with grammar, pronunciation than I am.

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:30.460
And so I'll check with her to make sure that I'm saying things as correct as possible.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:38.140
And she checks with me on prophetic significance, for example, or theocratic understanding or

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:45.819
procedure and timing. Yes. And something that's very important is when we do check with each other,

00:29:45.819 --> 00:29:52.940
we're not thin-skinned about the advice that we want to give each other. I'll call it advice.

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:59.740
And that makes life a lot easier. We don't get angry because we've been told we need to improve

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:05.740
on something. Well, that's excellent. You also spent a long time in the traveling work before

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:11.740
coming to Bethel. We knew you the traveling work early 70s and then later when we were down south.

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:17.740
You were assigned down there. What did you learn about showing honor in that avenue of service?

00:30:18.539 --> 00:30:25.420
Well, as you say, we were in the traveling work for 33 years just over. And most of those years,

00:30:26.059 --> 00:30:31.579
we would have other assignments. I would be working with the district, now regional convention

00:30:31.579 --> 00:30:38.140
organization or other assignments. And it meant that Angie would be alone in the congregation.

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:46.140
She never complained nor did she become unduly inquisitive about my assignment, which sometimes

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:52.779
would have been confidential. When we had an unexpected move that came up, a change of assignment

00:30:52.779 --> 00:31:00.940
somewhere, Angie would just pack and be ready to go. That's right. That was my job packing.

00:31:02.059 --> 00:31:07.259
And in the field ministry by the Morris, we would usually be in separate car groups because

00:31:07.259 --> 00:31:11.579
Bill would work with her brothers and I would work with the sisters. And I really appreciated

00:31:11.579 --> 00:31:19.099
the fact that he always made sure I had a safe driver. It worked out most of the time. And if we had

00:31:19.099 --> 00:31:25.660
a territory that was a little scary, why he made sure that we were safe in the territory. So I

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:33.819
appreciated that very much. In one congregation, things don't always go the way we plan.

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:41.180
The brothers scheduling the meals had scheduled two families for the same noon meal for us.

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:48.059
The one sister was deaf and she had always had the traveling brother on a certain day and she

00:31:48.059 --> 00:31:53.579
didn't hear when she was told it wouldn't be that day. So she had gone ahead and prepared a meal.

00:31:53.579 --> 00:32:00.380
In the meantime, we had been assigned to another home where they served us a full course or courses

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:06.380
Italian meal. While we were eating, we found out that the other sister was waiting for us. She would

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:11.660
have been highly offended if somebody didn't come. So I went to the Kingdom Hall, handled the meeting

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:17.819
for field service after the meal. Angie went to the sister and that sister would probably still be

00:32:17.819 --> 00:32:24.859
met at me if Angie hadn't gone. Boy, was I sleepy that afternoon after two big meals. You handle that

00:32:24.859 --> 00:32:32.859
very Christianly. Now, as we mentioned, your current assignment is here at Bethel. How have you

00:32:32.859 --> 00:32:39.420
navigated the unique challenges of this form of service and still honoring one another?

00:32:40.059 --> 00:32:46.059
Well, as you know, we work in different departments, but we respect that some things are

00:32:46.059 --> 00:32:53.500
confidential to that department. So we don't make the work of our department a major part of our

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:59.099
conversation. We would have an energy problem at the end of the day after working all day and

00:32:59.099 --> 00:33:05.980
feels very considerate about accepting too many social invitations. And so we respect each other's

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:13.579
limitations when it comes to physical and just energy in general. Well, that's certainly honoring

00:33:13.579 --> 00:33:21.259
each other. Well, Bill and Angie, those are practical and encouraging comments. We really thank you

00:33:21.259 --> 00:33:27.420
so much for taking the time and allowing us to interview you. And we really appreciate your good

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:35.900
example all these decades. Well, thank you. Well, the Samuicins are a wonderful example to try to

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:43.980
imitate. We know that many marriages may have a more difficult start in some cases. The mates may not

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:52.380
share the same spiritual values. What can be done if we find this to be true in our case? Notice how

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:58.220
sister Grace Lee from Great Britain dealt with these challenges in her marriage.

00:34:00.059 --> 00:34:09.659
I was born in Hong Kong in 1952. When I was about just over 14 years of age, my mother sent me down

00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:18.139
and said, look, there's a marriage maker and the gentleman he's agreed to take you as his wife.

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:23.179
I was absolutely petrified. I never met him before. We actually

00:34:24.219 --> 00:34:31.099
20 years different between age, but I wanted to go through because I love my mom. I want her

00:34:31.099 --> 00:34:39.739
to able to have a chance of happiness. I came to England. I'm not long after that. We starting our

00:34:39.739 --> 00:34:46.860
first Chinese takeaway in that little town. I had to work very hard seven days a week to help my

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:58.349
husband run the business. I was the only Chinese woman in the entire town. I have nowhere to

00:34:58.349 --> 00:35:06.349
ask for help or advice, so I have a really bad time. When my second daughter was born,

00:35:06.989 --> 00:35:12.190
when night she just stopped breathing and a few minutes later, the nurse come out and said,

00:35:12.909 --> 00:35:19.230
go to one flower for his garden and that's where your daughter's gone. So at that moment of time,

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:25.949
I was very hungry and I feel sad and sorrow and lonely. When I have the horrible guilt,

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:38.769
it's my fault. Oh, it's God. It's his fault. So I stopped praying to God. One day there was one very

00:35:38.769 --> 00:35:47.170
kind lady come to where not my daughter. And then eventually one day the lady stopped me and

00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:54.769
had a conversation. And the conversation lead to why people die and what happened when they

00:35:54.769 --> 00:36:01.489
did. Knowing is, no body thought. It's just our imperfection. I found that the great relief

00:36:01.489 --> 00:36:06.769
God did not punish me for that. And from then on, I started a Bible study for her.

00:36:08.369 --> 00:36:16.530
But my study, progressing very slow by that time, I had six children. I also have to work

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:23.250
full time. And also, the lady doesn't speak Chinese. And my English is no bit than her Chinese

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:35.280
leader. When I dedicated my life to Jehovah, it's not been easy. If I as my husband concern,

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:42.719
his wife should be concentrate looking after family and business, some wasting time on religions

00:36:43.679 --> 00:36:53.389
like that. My mum as well, very much against me, become Jehovah witnesses. My husband

00:36:53.389 --> 00:36:57.949
shouted at me often. He gave me her time because I want to take all my children to the meeting.

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:10.349
One day, he wanted me to choose between him or Jehovah. My praise Jehovah. I said, Jehovah,

00:37:10.349 --> 00:37:15.550
now it's a time. I need your Holy Spirit to help me. And I said, my husband is a good man.

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:24.829
And he deserved to know why I choose my life. And I just feel so calm. And then I turn around

00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:30.670
and ask my husband, what do you think of me since I've become a witness? Am I a better wife?

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:40.030
Or am I getting worse? So my husband said, oh, okay, then if that was the case, go serve your God

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:51.099
Jehovah. Before my mother died, my mother actually prayed to Jehovah to thank him to say,

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:59.179
since I've become a Jehovah witnesses, I've become a better daughter. I remember one day,

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:07.820
when my Bible student came up to my house and she was crying because she suffered persecution

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:14.300
from her husband. And my husband was sitting next to me and then he turned around and said,

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:22.780
you just have to persevere because my wife went through the same experience and looks where she is now.

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:27.500
The last 10 years, my husband come to all the meeting with me.

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:37.260
Seeing my children happy is the most important thing for me. And they're not only happy for a short time,

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:45.019
but they also have a happy future. My life now, I'm no longer lonely, I'm no longer a fatherless child,

00:38:45.019 --> 00:38:54.619
because I know Jehovah care for me, Jehovah help a little woman like me. And I'm sure Jehovah will help anybody who has to watch him.

00:38:55.340 --> 00:39:01.659
Sister Lee's example helps us to see that even in spiritually divided homes,

00:39:01.659 --> 00:39:07.179
applying Bible principles in our life, can often soften the heart of our mate toward the truth.

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:11.980
Having seen some beautiful examples of showing honor within our marriage,

00:39:12.539 --> 00:39:16.780
let's now look at ways of showing honor to one another in the congregation.

00:39:17.659 --> 00:39:23.099
For example, what if we're serving in a foreign territory where the customs and culture

00:39:23.179 --> 00:39:28.460
are quite different from what we're accustomed to? This is just one of many challenges

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:32.380
often faced by ones involved in the international construction work.

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:36.940
What have they found to be helpful when adapting to new environments?

00:39:38.219 --> 00:39:42.699
I've been involved in the International Construction Service for eight years in Congo,

00:39:42.699 --> 00:39:48.460
in Senegal, and now we're here in the Philippines. It's such a wonderful, wonderful privilege that

00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:54.059
Jehovah has given me through the years to learn different skills that I never ever imagined I was

00:39:54.059 --> 00:40:00.059
able to do. A construction site is a very happy site. Once you get there and you're working with

00:40:00.059 --> 00:40:07.260
your brothers and sisters, it's just happiness and joy. To be able to see the love they have for Jehovah

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:14.059
and the love they have for their assignment, that has been a wonderful thing. Everywhere you go,

00:40:14.059 --> 00:40:19.260
you can learn from a culture. There's like strong points in each culture that you can learn

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:24.940
and apply in your own life. There's been challenges and sacrifices we've made. For example,

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:32.780
living behind friends who have become very close, the congregation is a stronghold. It stabilizes

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:40.780
us. Actually, without the congregation, we couldn't be able to do our assignment. When we first came

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:46.619
to the Philippines, we were feeling kind of low and out of place, but then the family from our

00:40:46.619 --> 00:40:53.260
new hall invited us over for a meal after service. There would be some really good, tasty local dishes,

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:59.980
they played music, we sang, that just canceled the homesickness that we were feeling.

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:07.659
We support the local congregation by having a good service routine. The construction work that

00:41:07.659 --> 00:41:13.659
we do is the physical work, so sometimes you can lose the focus. We're being out in service,

00:41:13.659 --> 00:41:20.619
being able to work with the Brazilian sisters, it puts you back in focus. I really love being an

00:41:20.619 --> 00:41:28.300
external service because I love people. Working for hours with my Brazilian sisters just makes me

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:41.809
very happy and at the end of the day, it's always, always a very good day. Did you notice the beautiful

00:41:41.809 --> 00:41:48.530
thought that every culture has its own strong points that we can learn from and apply in our lives?

00:41:49.489 --> 00:41:54.769
What an excellent way to cultivate an attitude of viewing others as superior.

00:41:55.809 --> 00:42:02.530
But what about ones outside the congregation? Do we show honor to them as well? Of course.

00:42:03.409 --> 00:42:10.530
Galatians 6, 10 tells us, as long as we have the opportunity, let us work what is good toward all.

00:42:11.329 --> 00:42:17.489
The best way we can do this is by helping them cultivate and satisfy their spiritual needs.

00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:24.050
We now visit a town in the state of Oregon in the United States, where the congregations had a

00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:32.929
unique opportunity to do just this. An exciting event took place in 2017 across the United States.

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:38.610
August 21, 2017 has been on a lot of people's calendars for a long time because of the total

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:44.289
eclipse. As Jehovah's Witnesses, we are constantly on the lookout for events where we can support

00:42:44.289 --> 00:42:51.090
community outreach. Brothers and sisters prepared well in advance to give a Bible education to the many

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:57.329
travelers. What convinced us that this was an opportunity to give a great witness was we did

00:42:57.329 --> 00:43:04.050
a little research and we noticed the hotel bookings. The town was packed so we could tell this was

00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:10.610
going to be a big event. We needed to do something. We wanted to be in a position to share the wonderful

00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:15.409
things from the Bible with them. We need to take a global approach. We had to identify all the

00:43:15.409 --> 00:43:20.530
resources in band, not just to it by an individual congregation. So in our campaign, we decided to

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:27.329
feature three primary tools. First, what does the Bible really teach? Because many people wonder.

00:43:27.329 --> 00:43:33.889
Second, was life created with an eclipse event. People are thinking about the universe.

00:43:33.889 --> 00:43:41.250
It's a good opportunity to talk about our creator. And thirdly, jdm.org, since we expect a lot of

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:46.849
visitors from all over the world, we could reach them in their language. Over 200 brothers and sisters

00:43:46.849 --> 00:43:53.250
attended two seminars put on by local brothers to help prepare individuals for the massive campaign.

00:43:54.130 --> 00:44:02.210
We had examples of what not to do and what to do so as to benefit as many people as possible.

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:08.849
We had an interview. We had demonstrations on how to speak to people in different languages.

00:44:09.889 --> 00:44:16.289
We're expecting people from many different parts of the world. It's actually an opportunity to be

00:44:16.289 --> 00:44:22.449
like a missionary in our own hometown. Some of the estimates that we have heard are conservative

00:44:22.449 --> 00:44:26.369
estimates of probably 200,000 visitors. It may be more than that.

00:44:27.409 --> 00:44:32.690
The local congregations made themselves available to work with city officials to prepare the

00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:39.010
parks for the large influx of people. So many of Jehovah's Witnesses have volunteered to help

00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:44.530
in all kinds of things. These are really small communities that are having a very large influx

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:50.289
of people. So all of that extra effort and help in kind of preparing and cleaning up is much

00:44:50.289 --> 00:44:56.449
appreciated. We've had been working with Jehovah's Witnesses for a period of years here at Smith

00:44:56.449 --> 00:45:01.090
Rock. It's been a good experience for our staff and our volunteers and we want to accommodate that

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:06.530
anyway we can. There's been a lot of good things happening with cart witnessing. One of the friends

00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:11.889
had a nice experience with an Arabic speaking man, but she said the seminar is what helped

00:45:11.889 --> 00:45:17.650
there to be prepared. She knew how to work the app, how to find the video in the language. She already

00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:24.929
had it downloaded and ready to go. Paul spoke about his ministry. He said, well, is me if I did not

00:45:24.929 --> 00:45:30.929
declare the good news? So we don't want to look back in which we would have done more.

00:45:30.929 --> 00:45:35.570
Trying it for the first time, it can be scary, it can be nerve-wracking, but it's not so scary

00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:43.090
after you get started. What's really been fun is what we are calling roving. We go into an area where

00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:49.250
there's a lot of people and we just start conversations. We don't carry any literature. We just

00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:55.809
have our device and the JW got work contact card and then hopefully if the opportunity resents

00:45:55.809 --> 00:46:03.010
itself, we may share them a video or tell them where Jehovah's Witnesses. It's just been a paradise

00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:07.250
for them, a preaching paradise to all these visitors coming in. We may not see the results

00:46:07.969 --> 00:46:13.250
of the seed that was planted when they take a look at our card, but Jehovah knows and the

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:20.289
angels know and can make that room. This endeavor has really helped me to appreciate the need

00:46:20.289 --> 00:46:27.570
to be alert, to ways to expand our ministry. Most communities have a calendar of events,

00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:33.809
have we thought about looking at it and then make plans to give a witness by having our literature

00:46:33.969 --> 00:46:40.289
cards out. In really events like this, they have a bigger impact on us as Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:46:40.289 --> 00:46:45.329
because we have an opportunity to talk, we get excited about our work or all working together

00:46:45.329 --> 00:46:50.449
shoulder to shoulder. It really builds our faith. Recently a scripture that stood out to me was

00:46:50.449 --> 00:46:56.929
First Chronicles chapter 28 verse 20 where it says, be courageous and go to work.

00:46:57.889 --> 00:47:03.090
Help me to realize I just need to take the initiative and try. That's what we all need to do.

00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:10.690
And then let Jehovah decide how things turn out. Jehovah will no doubt bless your efforts as you

00:47:10.690 --> 00:47:19.099
show an interest in others. The interest we show in others is most noteworthy within the bounds of

00:47:19.099 --> 00:47:25.500
our own brotherhood. Galatians 6th 10, which we quoted earlier, ends its thought about working good

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:31.179
toward all saying that we should do this especially toward those related to us in the faith.

00:47:31.179 --> 00:47:39.739
Our music video entitled You Can Count On Me provides a touching example of how this good can be shown.

00:48:23.119 --> 00:48:43.039
He sees what we are and what more we could be. It's all in the way that what talented

00:48:43.039 --> 00:49:46.900
gift we possess to be is carried so you're my friend and I'm there times our tears expressing what

00:49:46.900 --> 00:51:37.309
birds cannot say. We conclude this month's program by traveling to Indonesia. Compose of

00:51:37.309 --> 00:51:45.070
more than 17,000 islands it consists of hundreds of distinctive ethnic and linguistic groups

00:51:45.070 --> 00:51:51.949
with the largest being the Javanese. Let's visit the city of Malong which has some 370

00:51:51.949 --> 00:51:58.590
publishers and nine congregations. The territory here is productive with many who are open to the

00:51:58.590 --> 00:52:05.949
Bible's message. The largest challenge our brothers face here is economic hardship. It's not easy to

00:52:05.949 --> 00:52:14.190
provide even basic necessities so many people in the territory work long hours. However, the pioneers

00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:20.829
have found an ingenious way to make a living making milk juice and cakes from soybeans. A typical day

00:52:20.829 --> 00:52:27.550
will have them up at 3 a.m. making fresh soy products and then selling them on the street in the morning.

00:52:28.989 --> 00:52:34.349
In the afternoon they preach and go to the market that evening to buy fresh ingredients for the

00:52:34.429 --> 00:52:39.949
next day's work. While the brothers and Malong have not yet been able to obtain a permit for an

00:52:39.949 --> 00:52:45.789
official kingdom hall they often meet in private homes. Although it can be cramped and hot,

00:52:45.789 --> 00:52:52.750
attendance is nearly always well over 100%. The publishers and Malong send their warm love

00:52:52.750 --> 00:53:00.989
and greetings to our entire global brotherhood. This is JW Broadcasting from the World Headquarters

00:53:00.989 --> 00:53:02.989
of Jehovah's Witnesses.
