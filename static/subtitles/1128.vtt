00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.410
How do you feel when you miss a meal or have an eaten for some time?

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.689
You know for many it affects their mood

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.490
their ability to concentrate

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:14.289
Sometimes their ability to even think straight

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.649
But what if that hunger was beyond our control?

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.289
Or prolonged to the point where we had no other choice but to be hungry?

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.929
Well, that was the situation the Apostle Paul found himself in as he engaged in

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:38.049
his ministry. For example, a second Corinthians 1127 Paul said that he was in hunger and thirst

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:44.049
and frequently without food. This likely occurred while Paul was traveling through

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:50.130
desolate regions or hot desert areas. At times he may have been hungry and thirsty because

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.090
of being dependent on strangers or on whatever provisions he could obtain through his own

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:01.649
labors and unfamiliar surroundings. Paul also lived during the time of a great famine,

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.689
a famine which lasted more than three years and caused oppressive poverty in Judea and Jerusalem.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.329
But despite facing all these times without food, it's interesting to note the attitude of the

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:23.890
Apostle Paul. A second Corinthians chapter 6 verse 10, he describes himself in his fellow

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:34.129
Christians as sorrowing but ever rejoicing. So Paul acknowledged that difficult times could

00:01:34.129 --> 00:01:43.969
bring a measure of sorrow and distress. But how was he able to rejoice? To have this inner joy

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.489
despite his hunger? Well, notice his answer. Turn with me in your Bibles, please, to the book of

00:01:51.489 --> 00:02:02.609
Philippians. And we're going to read Philippians chapter 4 verses 11 through 13. Paul says,

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.530
not that I am saying this because I am in need, but I have learned to be self-sufficient

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:15.330
regardless of my circumstances. I know how to be low on provisions and how to have an abundance.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.530
In everything and in all circumstances, I have learned the secret of both how to be full

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:30.610
and how to hunger, both how to have an abundance and how to do without. For all things I have

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:39.939
the strength through the one who gives me power. Did you note in verse 12, Paul speaks of learning

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:49.460
the secret of both how to be full and how to hunger. This secret involves relying on Jehovah

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:56.659
for life's necessities and being satisfied with whatever he provides. And Paul certainly did that.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.300
He learned a trade to support himself so as not to be a burden to others.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.819
He was fully occupied with his ministry, so he had few material possessions,

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.379
but he was grateful for the brotherhood. He was appreciative of what those brothers were able

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:21.139
to provide what he needed. Paul learned through each of these experiences. And as he saw,

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:26.819
Jehovah's hand in his life, it became apparent to him that no matter what his circumstances were,

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:34.259
he had to look to Jehovah to satisfy his needs. Did you notice verse 13,

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:42.740
Jehovah sustained Paul. He gave him power. So when Paul did face those adverse circumstances,

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:50.419
he was still able to be content, maintain inner joy, and carry out his ministry.

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:59.550
Well, what can you and I learn from Paul's example? It may be that we too might face hunger for a

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:08.509
variety of reasons. For example, food shortages. This could result from civil unrest or an economic

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:14.669
crisis. World events today have caused many to lose their jobs around the world, including our

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:23.949
brothers. So a personal economic setback may force us to live on less. Hunger can also result

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:29.230
from persecution. When many of our brothers were put in Nazi concentration camps,

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:36.029
depriving them of adequate food was one of the diabolical methods used in an effort to break

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:43.149
their integrity. And even when it comes to theocratic pursuits, some who move to serve with the

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:49.069
need is greater, are forced to make adjustments and must learn to be content with less.

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:58.670
So really, in any number of situations, you and I could experience a lack of food or even hunger.

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:11.310
And that can make us feel anxious and distressed. But the antidote is trust and reliance on Jehovah.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:19.949
You know, when we do that, it helps us to remain calm and to take things one day at a time.

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:28.079
When inflation hit in his country, one father said, my dearly prayer was simply that God would give

00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:40.509
us today our bread for this day in order for us to survive. We must also be grateful with whatever

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:45.389
Jehovah provides. When that same father went to the food line to purchase items,

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:52.430
he said, one time, the only thing they had left was something he didn't like. Oh, what did he do?

00:05:53.790 --> 00:06:01.629
He said, I didn't like it, but it was food. So that's what we ate that night.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:09.939
And he was grateful to Jehovah for providing it. You know, perhaps right now, we may be in a

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:19.300
position where we only eat what we like. But if circumstances change, could we adjust and still be

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:27.699
grateful? Isn't it reassuring that we are cared for by a God who gives us what we need?

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.180
And of course, it is important that we utilize the resources Jehovah provides.

00:06:34.579 --> 00:06:41.139
We'd like you to watch the following video. And as you do, note which provisions helped our

00:06:41.139 --> 00:07:05.470
sister to rejoice, despite experiencing hunger. Well, here in Venezuela, long before the crisis,

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:14.269
there weren't so many financial problems like we have today. We could go to the stores, we could

00:07:14.269 --> 00:07:27.680
buy the amount of food we wanted, and life was peaceful. For us, the situation started to get really

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:36.990
bad five years ago. It was hard to get any food at all, even basic items. When it came time to buy

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:45.519
something, well, it was all gone. There were two elders that I can say were checking on me almost

00:07:45.519 --> 00:07:54.300
daily, always asking how much food I needed. When I prepared it and served it, my main concern was

00:07:54.300 --> 00:08:06.290
that my children would get enough. I always gave them more food. Even though my youngest boy would ask,

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:12.850
Mommy, is that what you're going to eat? I would tell him, yes, dear, I'm fine with this.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:24.899
Then he would say, I don't think so. I would think, I can handle this, but the amount that I was eating

00:08:24.899 --> 00:08:37.259
just wasn't enough for my body. One Sunday morning during the meeting, I wasn't feeling very well.

00:08:37.899 --> 00:08:45.100
But thanks to Jehovah, my daughter was nearby. When I came to, she said, Mom, you fainted three times.

00:08:45.179 --> 00:08:53.419
I said, that can't be. So the brothers immediately took me to the doctor. I was diagnosed as having

00:08:53.419 --> 00:09:03.200
severe malnutrition. The brothers began a plan of action. They brought food that was already prepared,

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:10.100
and in fact, they would sit by me until I finished my food. I have not yet fully recovered my

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:20.100
body weight, because I was a little heavier. But health wise, I have felt very well. The elders

00:09:20.259 --> 00:09:26.179
were always looking after me. That boosted my energy, and definitely I never lost my joy.

00:09:30.379 --> 00:09:35.980
And it's all thanks to Jehovah. Thanks to him, because he is the one who sustains me.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:41.019
He clothes me, he feeds me, and he gives me great friends. That is what Jehovah gives me.

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:53.809
Did you notice the provisions that helped our sister? First, her relationship with Jehovah.

00:09:54.529 --> 00:09:59.009
She saw the importance of staying close to him and regularly attending her meetings.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:07.409
And then, of course, the brotherhood. Wasn't it comforting to see how attentive the elders were,

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:12.850
making daily checks on her, providing food for her and her family, and even making sure she ate

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:20.690
enough as well? Well, it's these same provisions, maintaining our relationship with Jehovah,

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:26.289
receiving relief from the brotherhood, as well as holding fast to our hope that can help us to

00:10:26.289 --> 00:10:34.769
rejoice, despite any periods of hunger. We agree. We are fully convinced of what Paul said in

00:10:34.769 --> 00:10:43.889
Philippians 412, Jehovah can and does provide life's necessities in all circumstances.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:52.049
When facing hunger, it is natural to be concerned for our own welfare and that of our loved ones.

00:10:53.009 --> 00:10:59.809
And yet, as we've seen, it is possible to rejoice. Despite any hunger, we may experience.

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:09.330
But the key, learn the secret. Everyone likes to be in on a secret. And Jehovah is more than

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:18.049
happy to reveal this one to us. But we must rely on him and see how he acts in our behalf.

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:26.769
How pleased Jehovah must be when his servants remain loyal and joyful, trusting that he will

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:35.250
never abandon them. Rather, Robert Lucioni, a helper to the publishing committee, will now present

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:47.009
the next talk of the symposium. We can rejoice, despite nakedness.
