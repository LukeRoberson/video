00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.179
After watching the 2020 Regional Convention in her native language of Cicewa, 16-year-old

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.660
Lisa from Malawi stated,

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:40.340
With this convention, I saw how Jehovah fulfilled his promise at Hebrews chapter 13 verse 5.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.299
I will never leave you, and I will never abandon you.

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:52.219
Many have made similar appreciative comments after watching the Convention in their language.

00:00:52.219 --> 00:01:00.299
You have made kind donations online at donate.jw.org, and by other means.

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:08.030
Thank you for these donations that support our extensive translation efforts.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.750
Earlier in our program, we discussed five piece records that we should put away.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.870
But what can we do if peace has been disturbed?

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.989
Can it be restored?

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:23.349
And if so, how?

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:29.390
We invite you to pay careful attention to the following four-part symposium.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:36.109
Brother John Ekran, a helper to the coordinators committee, will start us off with the talk,

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:49.439
seek peace and pursue it, by not quickly taking offense.

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.480
The title of this series of four talks is Seek, Peace, and Pursuit, and it's based

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.280
on 1 Peter chapter 3 and verse 11.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.680
Let's read that together.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.769
1 Peter chapter 3 and verse 11.

00:02:05.769 --> 00:02:09.969
Let him turn away from what is bad, and do what is good.

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:15.090
Let him seek peace and pursue it.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.090
Yes, we have to pursue peace, and pursuit requires effort.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.810
If you ever had to chase a piece of paper that was in your hands and got blown away by the wind,

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.009
and just when you get to it, the wind blows it away again and again, it can really take

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:37.050
quite some effort to retrieve and get that paper back in your hands.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.729
Just standing there and watching the paper blow further and further away is not going

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:45.169
to get it back.

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:47.969
Well peace can be a lot like that paper.

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:54.810
At some point, it can get blown away, and we have to then chase or pursue it to get

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.050
that piece back again.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:04.409
This series of talks will help us to pursue peace in four ways, by not quickly taking

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:16.250
offense, by apologizing, by forgiving freely, and by using our gift of speech wisely.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:24.050
Let's consider our first way to pursue peace, avoid quickly taking offense.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.289
Now because we are imperfect, we might misjudge others and quickly take offense.

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:32.650
Notice that we say quickly take offense.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.449
That's an important word.

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:42.189
We need to avoid jumping to conclusions quickly before we actually have the facts.

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:47.310
Even faithful men like Jesus apostles have taken offense too quickly.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.669
You may recall the time that Jesus and His apostles were looking for lodging in a Samaritan

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:53.189
village.

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:58.310
Now the Samaritans in that village rudely denied them lodging.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:06.710
At Luke 9 verses 54 through 56, the apostles James and John say to Jesus, Lord, do you

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.949
want us to call fire down from heaven and annihilate them?

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:18.319
But Jesus rebukes them for their rash and rather violent suggestion.

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:23.439
Luke of the serious consequences had Jesus yielded to the violent temper of James and

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:24.959
John.

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:29.439
The Samaritans could have become prejudiced against the kingdom message.

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:34.240
Instead, Jesus pursues a peaceful solution.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.040
The account says they simply went to a different village.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.480
Now, does this mean we're saying I can never take offense?

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.800
No, you may have a legitimate cause for complaint.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:55.680
The key point is that we should not quickly draw conclusions before we hear all the facts.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.399
Proverbs chapter 18 and verse 13 says,

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:07.689
When anyone replies to a matter before he hears the facts, it is foolish and humiliating.

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:15.500
In the following dramatization, know what helps one sister to overlook an offense.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.899
And they expected more from you.

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:20.220
Haley, what are you talking about?

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.699
Got to pin about my posts.

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:30.910
You doubt lonely that you've got nothing better to do.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:31.910
Haley?

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:37.110
Wait, please.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.629
I don't know what's happening.

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:41.949
Did you talk to Emily about my posts?

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:42.949
Yes, we do.

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:44.949
Do you gossiped about me?

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:47.550
No, why would I look up to you?

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.790
You're supposed to be the mature one and you're just like Emily busy running your

00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:53.829
Haley.

00:05:53.829 --> 00:05:57.430
Look, I can see you're upset.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:04.560
But trust me, this is a huge misunderstanding.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.160
I love you.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.199
I would never, ever say anything behind your back.

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:19.699
So please calm down.

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:31.670
Some days I just feel so alone between Nana and work.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.829
And then knowing all of you were talking about me.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.860
I promise that's not what happened.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:46.199
You're just really tired and overwhelmed.

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:50.629
So why don't we just slow things down a little?

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:58.670
You know, meetings always make me feel better, even on my worst days.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:04.829
Why don't we go inside, clean up a little, enjoy the program together.

00:07:04.829 --> 00:07:08.589
Then afterwards, we can all talk.

00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:17.269
I promise it'll be okay.

00:07:17.269 --> 00:07:19.790
Haley really was upset.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:25.550
She'd already concluded that she was being gossiped about by everyone.

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:33.069
If we find ourselves like Haley feeling offended, how can we avoid quickly taking offense?

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:36.790
Well we must stop and think.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:43.310
Let's read Ecclesiastes chapter 7 and verse 9 for some very good advice in these situations.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:49.910
Ecclesiastes chapter 7 and verse 9 do not be quick to take offense.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:56.139
For the taking of offense lodges in the bosom of fools.

00:07:56.139 --> 00:08:02.139
Like Celia said in the parking lot to Haley, please calm down.

00:08:02.139 --> 00:08:07.579
So in those situations, we need to think about what you know and just as importantly what

00:08:07.579 --> 00:08:09.579
you don't know.

00:08:09.779 --> 00:08:15.620
You know what you were told happened, but what was really said?

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.259
In the video, Haley quickly believed what she was told.

00:08:19.259 --> 00:08:24.019
She did not even ask Celia what she really said.

00:08:24.019 --> 00:08:30.370
Or you may know what was said, but do you know what was really meant by it?

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:33.409
Haley asked, did you talk about my posts?

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:39.789
And Celia said yes, and immediately Haley assumed the worst.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:44.029
Or perhaps we misjudged the person who heard us.

00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:50.830
Haley misjudged Celia on the spot by saying, you're just as bad as Emily.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:54.629
She had not even heard from Celia yet.

00:08:54.629 --> 00:08:59.389
Haley said to Celia, she was the mature one, the one she looked up to.

00:08:59.389 --> 00:09:03.230
And yet she was quick to believe the worst about her.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:10.009
Haley had not stopped and really thought about what she was thinking and saying.

00:09:10.009 --> 00:09:13.409
Perhaps she was having a hard day.

00:09:13.409 --> 00:09:17.090
Well Celia really set a fine example for us.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:23.330
Even though Haley spoke harshly to her, Celia was calm and listened to Haley.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:28.490
As Haley explained how she was feeling lonely, dealing and caring for her grandmother,

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:33.730
you can see the love and concern that Celia had for Haley, even though just moments before

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:38.090
she had spoken really harshly to her.

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:44.809
Well besides taking time to think things through, we also need to remember that it is Jehovah's

00:09:44.809 --> 00:09:47.809
opinion of us that matters the most.

00:09:47.809 --> 00:09:53.809
Now, that's an important point, especially when we deal with misunderstandings or false

00:09:53.809 --> 00:09:56.649
accusations.

00:09:56.649 --> 00:09:58.169
Think about it.

00:09:58.169 --> 00:10:02.049
Jehovah is an eyewitness to everything.

00:10:02.049 --> 00:10:05.129
Dilustrate that I want you to imagine.

00:10:05.129 --> 00:10:06.649
You had a traffic accident.

00:10:06.649 --> 00:10:12.490
Now you were just sitting at the stop sign, but another car ran straight into you.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:20.529
Now, police come and the person that ran into you says that you ran into them and the police

00:10:20.529 --> 00:10:23.129
believed them.

00:10:23.129 --> 00:10:25.409
You take the matter to court.

00:10:25.409 --> 00:10:26.409
The judge listens.

00:10:26.409 --> 00:10:33.210
As the other person says that you ran into them, however, before you can say anything, the

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:37.690
judge says, no, that is not what happened.

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:43.129
I was there walking on the sidewalk across the street that day and I saw the whole thing.

00:10:43.129 --> 00:10:49.860
Well, it's extremely likely that you can go to court and expect the judge for your case

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.460
to have been an eyewitness.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:56.659
This does illustrate, though, the peace of mind that we can have knowing that Jehovah

00:10:56.659 --> 00:11:01.139
is an eyewitness to all that happens.

00:11:01.139 --> 00:11:08.460
So when falsely accused, or we have a misunderstanding that we cannot seem to clear up, it is of great

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:16.980
comfort for us to know that Jehovah was there that day and saw the whole thing.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:22.700
We don't need to take offense at every negative thing that is said or done around us or feel

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:28.179
we have to defend ourselves as right on every occasion.

00:11:28.179 --> 00:11:36.600
We would surely wear out emotionally and probably not have very many friends.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:41.519
We should be willing to overlook minor transgressions.

00:11:41.519 --> 00:11:46.639
Let's look at Proverbs 19 and verse 11.

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:52.320
Proverbs 19 and verse 11, what can help us?

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:57.919
The insight of a man certainly slows down his anger.

00:11:57.919 --> 00:12:03.960
And it is beauty on his part to overlook an offense.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.519
So can you overlook an offense?

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:11.759
As the Proverbs said, that is beauty on our part.

00:12:11.759 --> 00:12:18.879
If not and you have a serious cause for complaint, handle matters according to Jehovah's direction,

00:12:18.879 --> 00:12:24.600
show insight, slow down any anger.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:31.320
Take carefully and listen patiently to make sure you clearly have all the facts before

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:35.590
you become offended or take action.

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:41.070
Remember that piece of paper that you had in your hands and got blown away by the wind?

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:44.990
What if it was a hundred dollar bill?

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:50.909
You would make every effort to pursue it and get it back because it is valuable.

00:12:50.909 --> 00:12:55.950
Our piece with our brothers is far more valuable than paper money.

00:12:55.950 --> 00:13:01.269
When our piece with our brothers or sisters is blown away by misunderstandings, mistakes,

00:13:01.269 --> 00:13:04.629
or sin, then you should pursue peace.

00:13:04.629 --> 00:13:08.409
Try hard to get it back.

00:13:08.409 --> 00:13:17.789
Yes, we glorify God and promote peace when we avoid quickly taking offense.

00:13:17.789 --> 00:13:21.909
Brother Ralph Walls, a helper to the Personnel Committee, will now present the next talk

00:13:21.909 --> 00:13:35.659
of this symposium, seek peace and pursue it by apologizing.

00:13:35.659 --> 00:13:39.379
I am so sorry.

00:13:39.379 --> 00:13:42.779
It's my fault, please forgive me.

00:13:42.779 --> 00:13:48.100
No matter how we phrase it, it can be difficult to apologize.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.500
Why is that so challenging?

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.340
There are many reasons.

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:56.259
We may fear confrontation, lame or rejection.

00:13:56.259 --> 00:13:59.620
Perhaps we feel embarrassed and we are too proud to apologize.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:04.820
We may reason, apologizing will not undo the blunder I have already made.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:09.139
And it may even be that we are angry.

00:14:09.139 --> 00:14:17.100
This is such a matter of concern that in July 2000, the California State Legislature in

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:23.100
the United States passed a bill designed to relieve people of liability if they express

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:27.299
sympathy to an individual who was injured in an accident in which they themselves were

00:14:27.299 --> 00:14:29.139
involved.

00:14:29.139 --> 00:14:33.539
It was noted that people often hesitate to extend an apology out of concern that it

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:39.220
could be construed in court as an admission of guilt.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:46.419
The Bible provides an account of a faithful servant, the Apostle Paul, who was a good example

00:14:46.419 --> 00:14:49.059
of one who apologized.

00:14:49.059 --> 00:14:53.139
The account is in the Book of Acts, chapter 23.

00:14:53.139 --> 00:15:01.059
The setting, a Roman military officer wanted to know why Paul was being accused by the Jews.

00:15:01.059 --> 00:15:08.299
So he brought Paul to the Jewish chief priests and commanded the Sanhedrin, the high court,

00:15:08.299 --> 00:15:10.100
to assemble.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:16.379
As we read Acts chapter 23 verses 1 through 5 together, we can't help but be impressed

00:15:16.379 --> 00:15:20.379
by Paul's boldness as he stands for what is right.

00:15:20.379 --> 00:15:26.379
But at the same time, please take note of his humility.

00:15:26.379 --> 00:15:29.139
Acts 23.

00:15:29.139 --> 00:15:32.580
Looking intently at the Sanhedrin, Paul said,

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:39.419
Men, brothers, I have behaved before God with a perfectly clear conscience down to this

00:15:39.419 --> 00:15:40.419
day.

00:15:40.419 --> 00:15:45.899
At this, the high priest and an I has ordered those standing by him to strike him on the

00:15:45.899 --> 00:15:46.899
mouth.

00:15:46.899 --> 00:15:53.100
Then Paul said to him, God is going to strike you, you white washed wool.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:58.419
Do you sit to judge me according to the law and at the same time violate the law by commanding

00:15:58.419 --> 00:16:01.059
me to be struck?

00:16:01.059 --> 00:16:08.019
Those standing by said, are you insulting the high priest of God?

00:16:08.019 --> 00:16:13.460
And Paul said, brothers, I did not know he was high priest.

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:20.649
For it is written, you must not speak injuriously of a ruler of your people.

00:16:20.649 --> 00:16:24.210
Paul immediately admitted his error.

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:30.409
And he had said that the one appointed as judge should not resort to violence was right.

00:16:30.409 --> 00:16:34.090
Yet he apologized.

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:39.169
In the following dramatization, we will see an older sister applying the inspired words

00:16:39.169 --> 00:16:45.210
of Titus chapter 2 verses 3 through 5 in order to advise younger sisters to be sound

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:47.250
in mind.

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:52.889
We will also observe how one of the younger sisters avoids further problems and pursues

00:16:52.889 --> 00:17:05.380
peace by humbly apologising.

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:13.660
I don't know how this happened, but Haley, I'm sorry.

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:23.210
It hurts me to see you so upset, if you too.

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:32.779
First, what you heard was not what I said.

00:17:32.779 --> 00:17:40.619
Well, I thought that's how you felt, and even if I got that part wrong.

00:17:40.619 --> 00:17:59.900
All this drama, let's stop, come on, girls, Haley, come closer.

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:18.390
Love is patient and kind, it's not jealous.

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:26.390
It doesn't become provoked, even when things become difficult.

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:32.190
So what are we going to do?

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:37.390
I just thought they've been.

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:47.450
No, I'm sorry, Haley.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:19:01.509
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have judged you so harshly, I shouldn't have judged you at all,

00:19:01.509 --> 00:19:07.779
and I'm sorry for dragging you into this, but twisting what you said.

00:19:07.779 --> 00:19:11.420
It's okay, things happen.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:20.809
I've been on both ends.

00:19:20.809 --> 00:19:30.329
I should never have spoken that way to you, Celia.

00:19:30.329 --> 00:19:39.859
To either of you, I'm to know.

00:19:39.859 --> 00:19:51.960
I'll call you tomorrow.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:56.759
The older sister apologized, even though she was not in the wrong.

00:19:56.759 --> 00:20:01.519
She also urged the two younger sisters to make peace.

00:20:01.519 --> 00:20:07.200
It takes courage, humility, and determination to apologize.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:16.349
It's interesting to know what stated at Philippians 2 and verse 3.

00:20:16.349 --> 00:20:21.470
Do nothing out of contentiousness or out of egotism.

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:27.750
But with humility, consider others superior to you.

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:33.910
That means our determined effort is not to win an argument, which could be contentious.

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:38.789
Nor do we want to start a discussion with the primary thought being that we are in the

00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:44.269
right, that mean that we are self-concerned or egotistical.

00:20:44.269 --> 00:20:51.430
Rather, in harmony with the principle of that scripture, we want to act with humility.

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:56.029
Our aim should be to pursue peace.

00:20:56.029 --> 00:21:02.950
Even if we think the other person is being unreasonable, we apologize.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:06.109
Why is it so important to do so?

00:21:06.109 --> 00:21:11.390
Because that is what makes our worship to Jehovah acceptable.

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:21.880
At Matthew chapter 5, verses 23 and 24, Jesus makes it very clear.

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:26.559
If then, you are bringing your gift to the altar.

00:21:26.559 --> 00:21:30.880
And there you remember that your brother has something against you.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:36.480
Leave your gift there in front of the altar and go away.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:40.440
First, make your peace with your brother.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:45.519
And then come back and offer your gift.

00:21:45.519 --> 00:21:51.480
One Bible scholar describes the scene this way.

00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:54.519
The worshipper has entered the temple.

00:21:54.519 --> 00:22:00.960
He has passed through its series of courts, the court of the Gentiles, the court of the women,

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.799
the court of the men.

00:22:02.799 --> 00:22:09.319
Beyond that, there lay the court of the priests, into which the laymen could not go.

00:22:09.319 --> 00:22:16.000
The worshipper is standing at the rail, ready to hand over his living animal to the priest.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.279
At that critical moment, the worshipper remembers that his brother has something

00:22:21.319 --> 00:22:24.079
against him.

00:22:24.079 --> 00:22:26.359
What is he to do?

00:22:26.359 --> 00:22:31.519
Leave your gift there in front of the altar, Jesus explains.

00:22:31.519 --> 00:22:34.799
And go away.

00:22:34.799 --> 00:22:39.480
What does Jesus say is more important in offering up a sacrifice?

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:43.960
First, make peace with your brother.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:49.799
Then, when you have come back, offer up your gift.

00:22:49.839 --> 00:22:55.759
The expression rendered make your peace means to reconcile.

00:22:55.759 --> 00:22:59.359
Jesus' words teach a crucial lesson.

00:22:59.359 --> 00:23:04.960
Reconciliation or peace comes before sacrifice.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:12.680
The way we treat fellow worshippers has a direct bearing on our relationship with God.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.799
1 John 4 verse 20 pointedly says,

00:23:15.799 --> 00:23:20.119
For the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen,

00:23:20.119 --> 00:23:24.759
cannot love God whom he has not seen.

00:23:24.759 --> 00:23:29.279
If we find ourselves in a situation when we have offended a fellow worshipper,

00:23:29.279 --> 00:23:31.480
we want to apply Jesus' counsel.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:37.039
We want to take the initiative to approach our brother or sister.

00:23:37.039 --> 00:23:40.039
We may need to acknowledge their hurt feelings.

00:23:40.079 --> 00:23:44.640
We may also need to ask, what can I do to make amends?

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:49.990
Often, a sincere apology is all that is needed.

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:54.869
Although our worship today no longer includes animal sacrifices,

00:23:54.869 --> 00:24:00.549
what Jesus was teaching emphasizes that there is a connection between

00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:06.109
peace with our brother and acceptable worship to God.

00:24:06.109 --> 00:24:08.549
When two humans are at odds,

00:24:08.589 --> 00:24:11.349
there may be a measure of blame on both sides,

00:24:11.349 --> 00:24:15.230
since both are imperfect and prone to error.

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:19.150
This usually calls for mutual concessions.

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:23.150
Even if only the one apologizing is right.

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:26.670
The issue is not so much who is right and who is wrong,

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:32.069
but who will take the initiative to make peace.

00:24:32.069 --> 00:24:35.390
When the Apostle Paul heard that the Christians in Corinth

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:40.869
were taking fellow servants of God to secular courts over personal differences,

00:24:40.869 --> 00:24:46.309
he said, why do you not rather let yourself be wrong?

00:24:46.309 --> 00:24:51.130
But why do you not rather let yourself be defrauded?

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:53.210
The principle is clear.

00:24:53.210 --> 00:25:01.490
Peace among fellow believers is more important than proving who is right and who is wrong.

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:06.089
Keeping this in mind makes it easier to apologize for wrong that someone thinks

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:08.529
we've committed against him or her.

00:25:08.529 --> 00:25:14.089
A heart-felt apology can open the way to a constructive conversation.

00:25:14.089 --> 00:25:20.640
It can minimize problems and restore peace.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:24.680
Brother Lynette Myers, a helper to the writing committee,

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:28.440
will now present the next talk of this symposium.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:40.490
Seek peace and pursue it by forgiving freely.

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:43.609
It's a simple fact that to be at peace with others,

00:25:43.609 --> 00:25:46.890
we must be willing to forgive.

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:49.410
Please notice two examples.

00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:52.609
A father and his teenage daughter didn't get along.

00:25:52.609 --> 00:25:56.609
Minor disagreements often developed into shouting matches.

00:25:56.609 --> 00:26:02.849
Finally, the tension got so bad that the daughter was asked to leave the house.

00:26:02.849 --> 00:26:08.809
Eventually, she recognized that she was at fault and asked for her father's forgiveness.

00:26:08.809 --> 00:26:13.890
But instead of overlooking her mistakes, her father rejected her efforts.

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:19.299
He was unwilling to extend forgiveness to his own daughter.

00:26:19.299 --> 00:26:22.660
Now, let's contrast that with another example.

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:27.779
A blameless man was condemned to die for a crime he didn't commit.

00:26:27.779 --> 00:26:31.740
Shortly before he died, the innocent man stated,

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:37.339
father forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:41.859
Those words of Jesus are recorded at Luke chapter 23 verse 34.

00:26:41.859 --> 00:26:47.099
And he may have been referring to the Roman soldiers who drove the nails into his hands and feet

00:26:47.099 --> 00:26:50.180
and who didn't know who he really was.

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:54.740
Or Jesus may have had in mind some in the crowd who demanded his execution

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:57.740
but would later exercise faith in him.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:04.119
The point is that Jesus was willing to forgive freely.

00:27:04.119 --> 00:27:07.839
How do we measure up with regard to forgiveness?

00:27:07.839 --> 00:27:12.000
Are we like Jesus willing to forgive others freely?

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:18.859
Or at times do we tend to be more like the man who was unwilling to forgive?

00:27:18.859 --> 00:27:21.500
Granting forgiveness isn't always easy.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:27.859
Imperfection exerts a powerful influence over us, sometimes robbing us of compassion.

00:27:27.859 --> 00:27:33.460
When someone hurts us, we may become resentful or hold a grudge.

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:38.460
And perhaps some of us were taught not to forgive others.

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:44.019
Little wonder that cultivating a peaceful forgiving spirit can be difficult.

00:27:44.019 --> 00:27:50.539
Still, the Bible encourages us to forgive freely.

00:27:50.539 --> 00:27:54.779
Let's consider another example of forgiveness in the man Job.

00:27:54.779 --> 00:27:59.220
And we're familiar with his trials, loss of his possessions and ten children,

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:04.420
a loathsome disease, and his wife told him to curse God and die.

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:10.019
Three companions heard about Job's calamities and they agreed to go comfort him.

00:28:10.059 --> 00:28:13.460
Job chapter 2 verse 13 states that when they arrived,

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:19.380
they sat with him for seven days and seven nights, but they didn't say a word to him.

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:23.460
Now maybe that was a good thing, because when they finally opened their mouths,

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:28.700
they deeply hurt Job with their baseless accusations.

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.940
But notice something interesting about this account.

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:34.980
Please turn with me to Job chapter 42.

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:39.460
At the end of Job's trials, Jehovah asked Job to do something regarding these false

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.980
accusers.

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:47.700
Notice Jehovah's words there, Job 42, the B portion of verse 8.

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:51.259
And my servant Job will pray for you.

00:28:51.259 --> 00:28:57.700
I will surely accept his request not to deal with you according to your foolishness.

00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:59.140
Did you notice?

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:01.539
After all the false accusations,

00:29:01.539 --> 00:29:06.059
Jehovah asked Job to pray for the men who had tormented him.

00:29:06.059 --> 00:29:08.460
Now, would Job tell Jehovah?

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:10.779
Jehovah, after what they said to me,

00:29:10.819 --> 00:29:13.220
I'm not going to forgive them.

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:16.059
Would Job be resentful?

00:29:16.059 --> 00:29:20.099
Notice the latter portion of verse 9.

00:29:20.099 --> 00:29:24.299
And Jehovah accepted Job's prayer.

00:29:24.299 --> 00:29:27.500
Job followed Jehovah's instructions.

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:32.380
What was the result of Job's integrity and his forgiving spirit?

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:34.420
Verse 10.

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:37.740
After Job had prayed for his companions,

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:41.740
Jehovah removed Job's tribulation and restored his prosperity.

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:45.579
Jehovah gave him double what he had before.

00:29:45.579 --> 00:29:48.859
The account goes on to say that Job had 10 more children.

00:29:48.859 --> 00:29:54.059
He lived for 140 more years and for 17 states.

00:29:54.059 --> 00:29:59.019
Finally, Job died after a long and satisfying life.

00:29:59.019 --> 00:30:01.660
Job was blessed for his forgiving spirit.

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:07.180
And he set a good example for us to forgive freely.

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:10.140
In the following dramatization with Celia and Haley,

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:42.019
notice why Haley finally decides to forgive freely.

00:30:42.019 --> 00:30:46.519
Been thinking of you, right, broadcast?

00:30:46.519 --> 00:30:48.359
How did you like the neurovigil?

00:30:48.359 --> 00:30:49.160
I'm sorry.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.359
Yes, I can't.

00:30:50.359 --> 00:31:08.539
I'm sorry.

00:31:08.539 --> 00:31:09.019
I'm sorry.

00:31:09.019 --> 00:31:12.940
Yeah, I wish you could give her a rest.

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:13.740
Sorry?

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:16.980
Oh, nothing.

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:17.940
I'm sorry.

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:20.740
It's just Emily for the millionth time.

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:22.420
What's the problem, love?

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:24.420
There's no problem.

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:32.359
It's just difficult to let her back in.

00:31:32.359 --> 00:31:49.940
Not that simple.

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:53.740
Not that simple.

00:31:53.740 --> 00:32:02.710
You want to forgive, but I'll get burned again.

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:08.309
Keep in mind, a chance to forgive is a chance to imitate

00:32:08.309 --> 00:32:10.230
Jehovah.

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:15.500
We wouldn't want to miss that opportunity.

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:18.779
I never thought about it like that.

00:32:18.859 --> 00:32:26.410
Think back to a time when you wanted forgiveness,

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:30.170
when it meant everything.

00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:31.369
How did it feel?

00:32:31.369 --> 00:32:38.329
Just like, you feel awful.

00:32:38.329 --> 00:32:40.170
That you've let everyone down.

00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:55.240
They forgive you.

00:32:55.240 --> 00:33:07.750
Suddenly everything's okay.

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:11.960
Emily, sorry, I haven't been back to you.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:18.779
Plans for tomorrow.

00:33:18.779 --> 00:33:21.819
What good reasoning on the part of Celia?

00:33:21.819 --> 00:33:26.059
Did you notice the expression that really touched Haley's heart?

00:33:26.059 --> 00:33:30.220
A chance to forgive is a chance to imitate Jehovah.

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:33.740
We wouldn't want to miss that opportunity.

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:37.180
So when we've been wronged, we don't want to miss the opportunity

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:41.420
to imitate Jehovah by forgiving freely.

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:46.700
Please notice how this is highlighted at Colossians chapter 3 verse 13.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:50.619
When we consider Job's example, remember that Jehovah instructed him to pray for

00:33:50.619 --> 00:33:55.180
his companions, and that helped Job display a forgiving spirit.

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:57.660
Well, notice here what Jehovah instructs us to do.

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.890
Colossians 3 13.

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:03.130
Continue putting up with one another

00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:06.329
and forgiving one another freely,

00:34:06.329 --> 00:34:10.250
even if anyone has a cause for a complaint against another.

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:17.829
Just as Jehovah freely forgave you, you must also do the same.

00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:20.789
The Greek verb used here for freely forgive

00:34:20.789 --> 00:34:26.230
is related to a word often rendered undeserved kindness or favor.

00:34:26.309 --> 00:34:30.949
When used in the sense of forgiving, this verb conveys the idea of doing so

00:34:30.949 --> 00:34:38.949
freely, generously. Just as when you, out of generosity, give a gift to someone.

00:34:38.949 --> 00:34:43.909
Jehovah requires that we freely forgive others in imitation of him.

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:50.389
Did you notice the end of the verse? You must also do the same.

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:54.389
Now, if the offense is minor, it's best to overlook it.

00:34:54.469 --> 00:35:00.550
1 Corinthians 13 verse 5 states that love does not keep account of the injury,

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:07.829
and Proverbs 19 verse 11 tells us that it is beauty to overlook an offense.

00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:12.150
However, if we feel that we need to talk to our brother or sister about an offense that was

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:16.469
committed against us, what's the best way to handle that?

00:35:16.469 --> 00:35:20.710
First, we should ask Jehovah in prayer for his guidance.

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:23.829
Then, with the brother's good qualities in mind,

00:35:23.829 --> 00:35:27.110
graciously tell him that we want to make peace.

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:30.630
Listen carefully and empathetically.

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:35.349
We shouldn't interrupt, even if we don't agree with everything being said.

00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:41.110
It may be that his viewpoint is wrong, but it is his viewpoint.

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:45.269
Then, when it's our turn to speak, we want to be gracious.

00:35:45.269 --> 00:35:47.989
Tell the brother what we appreciate about him.

00:35:47.989 --> 00:35:52.869
Apologize for any part that we played in the misunderstanding.

00:35:52.949 --> 00:35:57.269
If our humble efforts result in good, thank Jehovah.

00:35:57.269 --> 00:36:01.670
If they don't, keep asking Jehovah for guidance while we look for another

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:07.349
opportunity to make peace. When we truly forgive,

00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:10.869
we make a heartfelt decision to let go of resentment,

00:36:10.869 --> 00:36:16.309
and what peace that can bring us. Now, forgiving doesn't mean that we approve

00:36:16.309 --> 00:36:21.750
of a wrong action, consider it unimportant, or pretend it didn't happen.

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:25.989
Also, if we've been treated unjustly and have a cause for complaint,

00:36:25.989 --> 00:36:29.429
we do what we can to pursue peace and resolve the matter,

00:36:29.429 --> 00:36:34.539
and then we confidently leave it in Jehovah's hands.

00:36:34.539 --> 00:36:38.460
Brothers and sisters, what will you take away from this consideration?

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:43.340
I'm sure you'll agree that it can be a challenge at times to forgive.

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:47.179
But rather than be like the man we spoke of earlier who refused to forgive his

00:36:47.179 --> 00:36:51.579
own daughter, may we follow the examples of Jehovah,

00:36:51.579 --> 00:36:55.500
Jesus, Job, and Haley, by forgiving freely,

00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:00.219
generously. Remember, a chance to forgive

00:37:00.219 --> 00:37:06.059
is a chance to imitate Jehovah, and we wouldn't want to miss that opportunity.

00:37:06.059 --> 00:37:13.510
May all of us pursue peace by being willing to forgive freely.

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:17.190
For the Garrett Loche, a member of the governing body will now present the final

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:21.110
talk of this symposium. Seek peace and pursue it

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:32.440
by using our gift of speech wisely.

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:37.880
Why is it challenging to use our gift of speech wisely?

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:42.280
Because something powerful constantly works against us.

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:46.440
What is it? Imperfection.

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:51.880
The tongue is powerful. It can do much good, but because of imperfection,

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:55.639
it can also cause much harm.

00:37:55.639 --> 00:38:00.440
This thought is well expressed in the Bible book of Proverbs.

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:05.079
For example, Proverbs 12, 18 says,

00:38:05.079 --> 00:38:09.800
Thoughtless speech is like the stabs of sword,

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:14.519
but the tongue of the wise is healing.

00:38:14.519 --> 00:38:21.960
In Proverbs 18, 21 states, death and life are in the power of the tongue.

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:27.960
Those who love to use it will eat its fruitage.

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:33.960
Words have power, so we need to be careful about what we say

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:39.880
and how we say it. Perhaps you can recall when someone spoke

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:43.960
unkindly to you and hurt you deeply.

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:51.400
On the other hand, thoughtful speech can mend an aching heart and heal friendships.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:56.840
Because of imperfection, we all have difficulty controlling our tongue.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:02.360
This was true even of the first century disciple James.

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:06.760
He humbly acknowledged the challenge that all humans face

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:11.000
in the third chapter of his inspired letter.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.480
Notice how James described this in James chapter 3

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:20.300
verses 3 to 6 and verse 8.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:25.900
If we put bridles in the mouth of horses to make them obey us,

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:31.260
we guide also their whole body. Look also at chips.

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:35.900
Although they are so big and are driven by strong winds,

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:41.820
they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the man at the helm is

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:47.980
inclined to go. So too, the tongue is a small part of the body

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:54.539
and yet it makes great brags. See how small a fire it takes to set a great

00:39:54.539 --> 00:39:59.340
forest ablaze? The tongue is also a fire.

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:04.300
The tongue represents a world of unrighteousness among our body members.

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:09.739
For it defiles all the body and sets the whole course of life on fire

00:40:09.739 --> 00:40:13.900
and it is set on fire by Gehenna.

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:18.460
And verse 8, but no human can tame the tongue.

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:24.139
It is unruly and injurious, full of deadly poison.

00:40:24.139 --> 00:40:30.860
In addition to inherited imperfection, our upbringing could also be a factor.

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:40.300
The watchtower of September 15, 2006, page 21, paragraph 6 states,

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:47.739
In addition to human imperfection, family environment plays a role in the misuse of the tongue.

00:40:48.699 --> 00:40:53.179
Some people were raised in homes where parents were not open to any agreement,

00:40:53.900 --> 00:41:00.519
without self-control, fears. Despite such challenges,

00:41:00.519 --> 00:41:05.079
it is possible for each one of us to seek peace and pursue it.

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:14.780
Jesus set a good example in using the gift of speech wisely. He used his speech to encourage

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:20.699
and comfort others. While on earth he applied to himself the words

00:41:20.699 --> 00:41:25.980
founded Isaiah chapter 61, verse 1, which states the following,

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:32.820
The spirit of the sovereign Lord Jehovah is upon me, because Jehovah

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:39.940
anointed me to declare good news to the meek. He sent me to bind up the broken hearted,

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:45.940
to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the wide opening of the eyes to the prisoners.

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:54.980
As recorded at Matthew 12 verse 20, Matthew applies the words of Isaiah 42, 1 to 3,

00:41:55.059 --> 00:41:59.300
to Jesus. In Matthew 12 20 he stated,

00:42:00.739 --> 00:42:06.739
No bruised read will he crush, and no smoldering wick will he extinguish,

00:42:06.739 --> 00:42:15.059
until he brings justice with success. We learn an important lesson from such verses,

00:42:15.059 --> 00:42:21.300
Jesus recognized that the tongue has power, power to harm, and power to heal.

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:31.139
The watchtower of February 15, 2015, page 13, and paragraph 11,

00:42:31.139 --> 00:42:37.780
thus stated that, quote, Jesus showed discernment in all he said and did.

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:48.469
Can we imitate Jesus more closely? If so, what will you do the next time an opportunity arises

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:55.190
for you to use your gift of speech wisely? In the following dramatization,

00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:59.349
notice how the wise use of the tongue helps to heal.

00:43:39.909 --> 00:43:46.869
Mind to you! You have a treasure place in your hopeless house,

00:43:46.869 --> 00:43:54.070
he will help you out, out, out. He's like a drug, stop.

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:59.110
I was hoping he was using his song, but he's like, you've had a baby.

00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:05.429
Baroneca, oh my goodness, she is in love with her own voice.

00:44:06.389 --> 00:44:10.710
I just never sat near her at the hall, like she's the only one that can see him.

00:44:11.909 --> 00:44:19.349
My first thought, oh no, here we go again. I've seen this movie before.

00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:24.070
You don't think she's showing off? Is this just about Ellie?

00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:31.510
Seems it's all about Ellie. Is there just a little bit of envy in there?

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:45.320
I've lived it. If it's the case of her being more careful how she comes across, that's another matter.

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:51.559
What did she suggest? I should tell her that she needs to stop.

00:44:51.559 --> 00:44:56.840
Can you believe that? Especially as a pioneer. What kind of example is this?

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:59.159
How quickly it snowballs out of control.

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:07.219
You are such lonely. You've got nothing better to do.

00:45:07.699 --> 00:45:19.210
How difficult it can be to unravel.

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:34.519
A chance to forgive is a chance to imitate your hover.

00:45:36.039 --> 00:45:39.239
Think back to a time when you wanted forgiveness.

00:45:47.579 --> 00:45:51.500
Has anyone ever tried talking to her about her singing?

00:45:55.739 --> 00:46:00.940
You know what I love about Baroneca? She's probably the most hospitable person I know.

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:06.860
Always open house at her place. And can she cook? Have you tried her curry?

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:25.980
We should use our gift of speech to honor God and to benefit others.

00:46:27.019 --> 00:46:33.340
And if somebody gets angry at us, our mild reply can diffuse the situation.

00:46:34.139 --> 00:46:42.940
As Proverbs 151 says, a mild answer turns away rage, but a harsh word stirs up anger.

00:46:44.139 --> 00:46:48.940
We can also use our gift of speech to console and encourage others.

00:46:50.539 --> 00:46:55.179
First, there's Alonians 5, 11 and 14 states.

00:46:55.980 --> 00:47:03.900
Therefore, keep encouraging one another and building one another up just as you are in fact doing.

00:47:05.179 --> 00:47:12.139
On the other hand, we urge you, brothers, to warn the disorderly, speak consolingly to those

00:47:12.139 --> 00:47:17.019
who are depressed, support the weak, be patient toward all.

00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:23.500
Yes, even faithful servants of Jehovah may at times struggle with depression.

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:26.139
How can we help such ones?

00:47:27.579 --> 00:47:34.139
offer specific genuine commendation to help them see their own value in Jehovah's eyes.

00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:41.820
Share with them the powerful words of Bible texts showing that Jehovah truly cares about and

00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:46.059
loves those who are broken at heart and crushed in spirit.

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:53.340
We can also use the power of our tongue to provide much needed encouragement to others.

00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:58.139
Has a fellow believer lost a loved one in death?

00:47:59.659 --> 00:48:05.820
Sympathetic words expressing our care and concern can comfort a grieving heart.

00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:10.860
Is an elderly brother or sister feeling unneeded?

00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:17.980
A thoughtful tongue can reassure older ones that they are valued and appreciated.

00:48:19.579 --> 00:48:22.219
Is someone struggling with the chronic illness?

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:30.940
Kind words shared on the phone or in person can do much to lift the spirits of one who is sick.

00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:38.539
How pleased our Creator must be when we use the power of speech to other sayings

00:48:38.539 --> 00:48:40.460
that are good for building up.

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:49.179
We may not be able to fix their problems, but we can let them know that we love them and we care

00:48:49.179 --> 00:48:55.739
about them. For example, you can arrange to spend time with him or her.

00:48:56.539 --> 00:49:00.139
Additionally, we can use God's word to strengthen them.

00:49:01.739 --> 00:49:06.699
Or you may notice that someone in the congregation is discouraged or depressed.

00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:11.900
You could read an encouraging Bible verse and even offer to say a prayer.

00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:18.539
We assure such ones that their brothers and sisters in the congregation love them.

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:25.340
And speak in a way that shows that you really mean and believe what you say.

00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:32.380
This symposium has given each one of us much to think about, has it not?

00:49:33.019 --> 00:49:37.739
We have been reminded that seeking peace is not always easy.

00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:43.739
We have also learned that pursuit of peace requires effort.

00:49:45.739 --> 00:49:52.380
In what specific ways are you resolved to seek peace and pursue it and the days ahead?

00:49:54.059 --> 00:49:56.940
May we all continue to pursue peace?

00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:01.579
One, by not quickly taking offence,

00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:04.780
two, by apologizing,

00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:08.219
three, by forgiving freely.

00:50:09.099 --> 00:50:15.659
And four, by using our gift of speech wisely to encourage and comfort others.

00:50:17.099 --> 00:50:22.539
And Major Hover, the God of Peace bless you abundantly for doing so.

00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:29.900
Thank you, brothers, for reminding us that the peace we enjoy does not happen by chance.

00:50:30.619 --> 00:50:33.579
It requires continuous effort on our part.

00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:37.739
But we can succeed with Jehovah's help.

00:50:41.219 --> 00:50:44.099
We have now come to the concluding talk of this session.

00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:50.099
True Christians come from a variety of backgrounds and cultures.

00:50:51.139 --> 00:50:53.059
Individual conscience is differ.

00:50:54.019 --> 00:50:58.500
How can we remain united despite these differences?

00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:04.980
Please give your attention to Brother David Spain, a member of the governing body,

00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:07.300
as he delivers the talk entitled,

00:51:08.179 --> 00:51:11.940
Safeguard our United Bond of Peace.

00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:25.980
When we think of unity, the words of Psalm 133-1 may come to mind.

00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:27.099
Let's read them.

00:51:27.179 --> 00:51:31.019
Now, the words aren't going to be on the screen, so let's look them up in the Bible.

00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:38.699
I'll give you a moment. That's Psalm 133-1.

00:51:39.739 --> 00:51:47.820
It says, look how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity.

00:51:49.019 --> 00:51:52.539
Well, we certainly agree with these words of David.

00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:57.500
Now, speaking of David, he knew the value of unity.

00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:02.699
And we may remember that he didn't always get to experience it in his own life.

00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:06.940
The beginning and the end of his reign were marked by civil war,

00:52:07.659 --> 00:52:10.139
the fairy opposite of unity.

00:52:11.099 --> 00:52:14.940
But you'd think it would have been easy for the Israelites to remain united.

00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:18.139
After all, they came from the same roots.

00:52:18.699 --> 00:52:20.539
They were all children of Abraham.

00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:23.579
They spoke a common language, Hebrew.

00:52:24.619 --> 00:52:28.460
And they came from a similar social background.

00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:31.099
The ancestors had all been slaves in Egypt,

00:52:31.099 --> 00:52:35.019
so there was no basis for anybody to brag about his heritage.

00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:40.300
Still, the Israelites found reasons to hate one another.

00:52:41.179 --> 00:52:43.019
Israel's first king was from Benjamin.

00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:45.659
His second king was from Judah.

00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:50.219
That was reason enough to start a war in Israel.

00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:53.900
Let's fast forward now to the first century.

00:52:54.780 --> 00:53:00.059
Unity is so important that it was on Jesus' mind on the night before he died.

00:53:00.699 --> 00:53:04.940
You remember, he prayed to his father that his disciples might be one,

00:53:05.659 --> 00:53:08.699
just as he and the father are one.

00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:11.820
Now, that could have been a challenge.

00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:14.300
Why do we say that?

00:53:15.579 --> 00:53:19.820
From a human standpoint, there was no reason for Jesus' disciples to be united.

00:53:20.699 --> 00:53:24.460
Unlike the Israelites, they did not have a common ancestor.

00:53:25.659 --> 00:53:28.300
They did not have a common mother tongue,

00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:31.579
and they came from a variety of social backgrounds.

00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:32.780
Think of it.

00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:36.460
The first Christians were Jews or Jewish proselytes.

00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:42.539
Growing up, they were taught that Gentiles were unclean and they wouldn't even enter the

00:53:42.539 --> 00:53:45.019
home of a Gentile, let alone preach to one.

00:53:47.219 --> 00:53:51.460
As for Gentile Christians, they came from every nation under heaven.

00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:56.019
Most of them knew nothing of the Hebrew language or the Hebrew scriptures.

00:53:56.019 --> 00:53:57.460
They'd worshipped false gods.

00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:05.300
Some had been highly educated in Athens, Alexandria, or some other center of worldly wisdom.

00:54:06.019 --> 00:54:08.820
Others had little formal education.

00:54:09.619 --> 00:54:15.780
Yet, when they accepted the truth, Christians became united and at peace with one another.

00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:22.900
The Apostle Paul wanted to help them to safeguard that bond of peace.

00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:26.019
Now, that's the theme of our discussion this morning.

00:54:26.019 --> 00:54:32.739
And we're going to look at his words recorded at Ephesians chapter 4 verses 3 to 6.

00:54:32.739 --> 00:54:40.179
And we're going to focus in on a particular expression in these verses.

00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:42.900
This is Ephesians chapter 4, I'll give you a moment.

00:54:44.739 --> 00:54:49.619
Ephesians chapter 4, and we're going to read verses 3 to 6.

00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:55.780
Now, Paul is interested in unity here.

00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:58.739
So let's see how he frames his discussion.

00:54:59.619 --> 00:55:06.739
He says, earnestly and devoring, so an effort is involved, earnestly and devoring,

00:55:07.539 --> 00:55:13.860
to maintain the oneness of the spirit in the uniting bond of peace.

00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:21.300
One body there is, and one spirit, just as you recall to the one hope of your calling,

00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:30.739
and many emphasizes, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all.

00:55:31.699 --> 00:55:38.099
Now, let's go back to verse 3 and look at the expression the uniting bond of peace.

00:55:38.739 --> 00:55:43.780
So our discussion is safeguard the uniting bond of peace.

00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:47.139
Now, the study Bible has an interesting note on that expression.

00:55:47.139 --> 00:55:56.019
It tells us that the word translated uniting bond can also be translated ligament, ligament.

00:55:56.659 --> 00:55:59.940
And it is translated ligament in other verses.

00:56:00.739 --> 00:56:02.900
Now, we know what an ligament is.

00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:06.500
It's a band of strong tissue that holds our bones together.

00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:14.420
Also, when we talk about the uniting bond of peace, we mean that peace is the ligament.

00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:17.619
It's the tissue that holds God's people together.

00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:22.420
That was true in the first century, and it's true today.

00:56:24.019 --> 00:56:27.539
Like the early Christians, we come from different backgrounds.

00:56:28.099 --> 00:56:29.539
We speak different languages.

00:56:30.179 --> 00:56:34.820
Yet Jehovah has shown us how to remain united and at peace.

00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:41.300
Now, let's explain what we mean by being united to be united.

00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:47.139
Doesn't mean that we all have to like the same things or we all have to think the same on every subject.

00:56:47.699 --> 00:56:50.739
There's room for a variety of tastes and opinions.

00:56:51.539 --> 00:56:54.179
There's variety on this convention program.

00:56:54.179 --> 00:56:58.340
We don't all wear the same style of suit or have the same color of tie.

00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:01.059
What about you?

00:57:02.659 --> 00:57:04.019
What's your favorite color?

00:57:05.699 --> 00:57:06.900
Your favorite food.

00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:09.539
Your favorite pet.

00:57:10.579 --> 00:57:14.900
In Jehovah's organization, there are dog lovers and cat lovers,

00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:17.780
and not everyone likes the same breed of dog or cat.

00:57:19.059 --> 00:57:23.780
Have you ever visited someone who has a pet that he thinks is just adorable?

00:57:24.260 --> 00:57:28.659
You take one look at the animal and you wonder how anyone could love a face like that.

00:57:29.219 --> 00:57:29.940
Yet he does.

00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:35.300
People are different, and their pets are grateful for that.

00:57:37.639 --> 00:57:42.519
The variety we find among God's people today will continue on into the new world.

00:57:42.519 --> 00:57:44.280
Jehovah loves variety.

00:57:45.159 --> 00:57:46.599
How many colors are there?

00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:50.920
How many species of plants, birds, and animals?

00:57:51.719 --> 00:57:55.159
Among God's creation, we find the simple and the complex.

00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:57.320
The plain and the fancy.

00:57:58.280 --> 00:57:59.800
The sweet and the sour.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.760
The rough and the smooth.

00:58:03.639 --> 00:58:07.159
There's great variety among people, even in the new world.

00:58:07.719 --> 00:58:12.599
Perfect humans won't have the same personality, talents, and abilities.

00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:15.559
You've always wanted to play the violin.

00:58:16.119 --> 00:58:20.519
Don't think when you're perfect you'll just be able to pick up a violin and play,

00:58:21.239 --> 00:58:24.920
and there's no guarantee you'll be able to play in an orchestra.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.719
Now, one way to maintain unity is to respect the conscience of others.

00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:37.559
This is very important, because very often when unity is disturbed,

00:58:37.559 --> 00:58:44.199
it's because we don't respect the ability of other brothers and sisters to decide things for themselves.

00:58:44.199 --> 00:58:46.840
Now, what do we mean by the conscience?

00:58:47.559 --> 00:58:48.360
That's be simple.

00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:54.679
It's the faculty that helps us determine right from wrong.

00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:56.760
I'm going to repeat that.

00:58:56.840 --> 00:59:02.360
The conscience is the faculty to determine right from wrong.

00:59:03.719 --> 00:59:07.400
Now, let's consider how our upbringing and our culture

00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:11.079
can help shape our personal view of right and wrong.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.400
In some cultures, there are large families.

00:59:16.119 --> 00:59:18.679
Conversation around the dinner table is loud.

00:59:18.679 --> 00:59:20.360
You can hardly hear yourself think.

00:59:21.079 --> 00:59:26.440
The children tease one another and don't hesitate to ask each other personal questions.

00:59:27.079 --> 00:59:31.639
The girls borrow each other's clothes, sometimes without asking.

00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:34.760
Some people would say that's wrong.

00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:37.960
Put the girls, see nothing wrong with it, and neither do their parents.

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:43.559
In other cultures, family members are polite and courteous,

00:59:43.559 --> 00:59:47.079
but they don't talk much about their plans or their feelings.

00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:53.559
The parents don't often talk about their past because they value their privacy.

00:59:54.519 --> 00:59:59.880
Now, some who were raised that way tend to be rather strict with themselves and others.

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:03.400
They have definite views of right and wrong.

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:07.000
They're all there clothes without asking, and they'll say,

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:09.960
that's stealing, I'm calling the elders.

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:13.800
There are no gray areas with them.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.840
Now, there are lots of exceptions, and we're not saying that everyone in a certain culture

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:21.239
fits the bill, but you get the idea.

01:00:21.559 --> 01:00:28.440
Now, what do you suppose happens when a publisher from one culture moves into a congregation

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:30.760
where the other culture predominates?

01:00:31.559 --> 01:00:35.400
If he doesn't adjust his way of viewing others, he'll be miserable.

01:00:36.199 --> 01:00:37.880
Is one way right and the other wrong?

01:00:38.519 --> 01:00:43.079
No. Members of both cultures could learn from one another.

01:00:44.599 --> 01:00:49.480
Speaking of culture, we might ask ourselves, how do I feel about brothers and sisters

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:52.280
who come from cultures that are very different from my own?

01:00:53.239 --> 01:00:54.519
Let me speak with an accent.

01:00:55.639 --> 01:00:57.960
Their style of dress may be different.

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:02.039
Their manners and food may not be what we're used to.

01:01:03.239 --> 01:01:07.000
Suppose that an elder is younger than we are, or from a different race.

01:01:08.039 --> 01:01:09.400
Will we accept his counsel?

01:01:10.599 --> 01:01:12.679
Will we ask him for counsel?

01:01:13.719 --> 01:01:18.440
Or will we look for an elder who's older and from a similar background?

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:25.079
Will we celebrate our differences or will we allow them to disturb our unity?

01:01:26.599 --> 01:01:31.000
So that's one thing, but let's talk about our personal history.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.079
Our personal history can also affect our view of right and wrong.

01:01:36.119 --> 01:01:40.199
Some grew up in a household where alcohol was a problem.

01:01:41.079 --> 01:01:47.880
Home was not a happy place, and as adults, they stay as far away from alcohol as they can.

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:53.559
And they take a dim view of anyone who uses it, even in moderation.

01:01:54.199 --> 01:01:58.119
To them, it's just plain wrong to drink.

01:01:59.239 --> 01:02:01.960
Others have only good memories of their childhood home.

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:06.840
At supper time, there was always wine on the table, but nobody ever abused it.

01:02:09.110 --> 01:02:15.590
A person who left behind an immoral lifestyle might be extremely sensitive about choices of clothing.

01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:20.869
He may be troubled by a clothing style that other brothers and sisters find totally acceptable.

01:02:22.469 --> 01:02:27.429
If they're not careful, those who tend to be strict with themselves could impose their

01:02:27.429 --> 01:02:32.230
conscience on others. Now let's consider a familiar scenario.

01:02:33.429 --> 01:02:37.030
Four publishers are working rural territory in a car group.

01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:42.070
Now each home is separated from the next by many miles or kilometers.

01:02:42.949 --> 01:02:47.989
At the first call, the driver and her companion get out and the other sisters stay in the car.

01:02:47.989 --> 01:02:50.070
They have no choice. There's no place to go.

01:02:50.869 --> 01:02:55.349
Now the householder has many questions, and a Bible study is started.

01:02:56.309 --> 01:03:00.949
It's noon when the two publishers return to the car. All smiles.

01:03:02.309 --> 01:03:03.989
You know what's coming next, don't you?

01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:10.789
One of the sisters in the back seat says, well, the two of us can't count

01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:17.829
any time this morning. What's she done? She's spoken for herself and for her companion,

01:03:17.829 --> 01:03:22.230
and unintentionally she's imposed her own conscience on her friend.

01:03:23.030 --> 01:03:27.829
Now she doesn't want to count any time, that's her business. It would be best if she kept

01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:35.030
her business to herself. If you've ever visited a foreign country and gone on a guided tour,

01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:40.230
probably one of the things the tour guide wanted to show you was the architecture inside a church.

01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:45.349
Now some brothers have no problem entering a church if it's part of a tour, because to them

01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:51.670
it's no different from visiting a museum. Others, who were strong supporters of false religion,

01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:58.309
couldn't enter a church for any reason, not even to attend a wedding or a funeral. To them,

01:03:58.309 --> 01:04:05.670
it's just plain wrong. Contrances can differ in this respect, and we have to respect that.

01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:09.590
We have to acknowledge that, and we're going to expand on that idea in a moment.

01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:15.989
Well, we've hardly scratched the surface when it comes to describing the variety of

01:04:15.989 --> 01:04:21.349
personalities and viewpoints in Jehovah's organization. So here's the question,

01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:30.389
how can we maintain our unity? Remember what Paul said, earnestly endeavouring

01:04:30.389 --> 01:04:39.429
to maintain this perfect bond of unity. It means that we have to put forth effort

01:04:40.070 --> 01:04:46.230
to maintain that unity. Well, first of all, it'll help a lot to get well acquainted with

01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:51.590
brothers and sisters who think differently from us. Get to know their background. That'll help you

01:04:51.590 --> 01:04:58.150
to not to over-react when they take a position that we don't agree with. It'll help us not to judge

01:04:58.150 --> 01:05:05.030
them. Now Paul wrote very plainly on that subject, in the words found at Romans chapter 14 and

01:05:05.030 --> 01:05:13.530
verse 4. Simple statement, but very powerful. Let's check it out together. Romans chapter 14,

01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:25.579
I'll give you a moment, and verse 4. All right, who are you to judge the servant of another?

01:05:26.619 --> 01:05:35.340
To his own master, he stands or falls. Indeed, he will be made to stand for Jehovah can make him

01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:43.179
stand. Now let's go back and look at that first sentence again. Who are you to judge the servant

01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:52.300
of another? We know what a judge does. He declares someone guilty or not guilty. That's not our job.

01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:59.340
Jehovah is the judge. If each of us concentrates on his own thinking and his own conscience,

01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:03.980
the peace and unity of the congregation will be preserved.

01:06:05.739 --> 01:06:12.460
Well, we all want to be balanced when we determine what is right and what is wrong. We want to have

01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:19.019
a balanced view of things, a good conscience. So how can we be balanced when determining whether

01:06:19.019 --> 01:06:25.500
something is right or wrong? Now in some cases it's easy, the Bible tells us, but in other cases

01:06:26.139 --> 01:06:32.300
there's no clear answer. Let's consider a scenario we touched on earlier, the matter of entering

01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:39.340
a church. Now that may not be a problem where you live, but in some places it's a real issue.

01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:43.980
And remember, these talks are for our worldwide brotherhood, so we're going to consider

01:06:44.699 --> 01:06:50.619
a subject that will be a real problem for our menager overcome and we hope that they will benefit

01:06:51.179 --> 01:06:56.380
from it. So here's the scenario. Two different sisters are married to men who are not in the truth.

01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:03.579
Now in both cases the husband's mother has died. The funeral will be in a church.

01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:12.699
One sister decides to go. The other decides against it. The sister who decides to attend

01:07:12.699 --> 01:07:18.219
has considered that in that church there will just be a talk by a clergyman. There will be no

01:07:18.219 --> 01:07:24.619
congregation singing, congregation prayers or religious gestures. She was never very religious

01:07:24.619 --> 01:07:30.300
anyway so none of that would mean anything to her. And her husband and his family will be happy

01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:38.780
if she just sits quietly until it's over. Now the second sister has a different set of circumstances.

01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:44.699
The service in that church involves participation by the congregation. She used to be an active

01:07:44.699 --> 01:07:48.940
member of that church and she's afraid she'll do something she'll regret.

01:07:50.059 --> 01:07:55.340
Her husband's family get very emotional at funerals and they're likely to make a scene

01:07:55.340 --> 01:08:01.579
if she doesn't participate. So she respectfully tells her husband that her attendance could

01:08:01.579 --> 01:08:09.659
cause him embarrassment and declines to attend. You can see that each situation is different.

01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:16.779
Now we're going to discuss four questions that we might ask ourselves when we're called upon to

01:08:16.779 --> 01:08:25.020
make any difficult decision. And I will repeat the question because if you're taking notes you

01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:30.220
may want to write at least the question down. These are very very good questions that we can ask

01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:38.300
ourselves before we make a difficult decision. Are you ready? Here's number one. What will make

01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:50.220
Jehovah happy? I'll repeat that. What will make Jehovah happy? And that should be our main concern

01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:56.699
to please Jehovah. Well how do we know what will make Jehovah happy? We identify the Bible

01:08:56.699 --> 01:09:02.939
principles that have a bearing on the situation. One way we can do that is by checking the index

01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:09.340
or the research guide. What are some scriptural principles assistive who's married to an unbeliever

01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:15.420
might consider when deciding whether to attend a funeral in a church? Can you think of some?

01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:24.300
What about 1 Peter 3 verse 1? Lives be in subjection to your husbands. Jehovah is pleased when a

01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:31.659
Christian woman respects her husband whether he's in the truth or not. But a wife's subjection

01:09:31.739 --> 01:09:42.220
is relative. She's dedicated to Jehovah, not to her husband. She's dedicated to Jehovah, not

01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:50.140
to her husband. So that's 1 Peter 3.1. What about Isaiah 52 and verse 11?

01:09:51.340 --> 01:10:00.220
Touch nothing unclean. Keep yourselves clean. Under the mosaic law, if someone so much has

01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:07.180
touched something unclean, he became unclean. Many brothers and sisters would find it very

01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:13.340
hard to sit quietly while a clergyman told lies about the condition of the dead. To them it would

01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:20.779
be touching something unclean. Others might compare that to a young person in school sitting quietly

01:10:20.779 --> 01:10:28.140
while his teacher tells lies about the origin of life. If someone does decide to attend a

01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:35.579
funeral in a church, he or she should be absolutely determined not to participate in any religious

01:10:35.579 --> 01:10:42.300
ritual whether singing hymns or so much as saying e-men to a prayer that a clergyman offers.

01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:52.619
Remember the goal? To please Jehovah. So the first point was what makes Jehovah happy? Number two,

01:10:53.260 --> 01:11:06.579
number two, how might my choice affect others? Have you got that? How might my choice affect others?

01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:14.100
We would never want to stumble anyone. Even in a family matter such as attending a wedding or

01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:20.100
a funeral in a church which we may consider as a personal matter, we need to weigh the effect our

01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:27.539
decision could have on others. It could affect them in one of two ways. Now the first is the

01:11:27.539 --> 01:11:34.340
obvious way. In some areas of a witness even entered a church, his brothers and sisters would lose

01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:41.220
respect for him. But there's a second way the witness could stumble someone. He might be able to

01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:47.460
attend the funeral and make no compromise. But suppose a new brother decided to follow his example

01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:53.460
when a family member died. The Drew brother could give in to family pressure and participate in

01:11:53.460 --> 01:12:02.100
idolatry. How tragic is that? The Apostle Paul never worshipped idols. So when meat that had been

01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:07.140
offered to an idol went up for sale on a meat market, it probably didn't bother Paul's conscience

01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:14.420
to buy it because he knew that an idol is nothing. But some of his brothers had worshipped those

01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:20.180
very idols before coming into the truth. They could have felt guilty about eating that meat. To

01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:28.869
them it would be like having a communion meal with an idol. The feelings of his brothers were

01:12:28.869 --> 01:12:35.029
important to Paul. He was willing to sacrifice his own rights for the sake of his brothers.

01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:41.270
We'd never want to take the unloving view that if our brother is stumbled by what we do,

01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:48.789
it's too bad for him. On the other hand, if we're the type of person who is often stumbled by

01:12:48.789 --> 01:12:58.310
what others do, we need to ask Jehovah to help us gain a more balanced viewpoint. So far, we've

01:12:58.310 --> 01:13:03.989
discussed the need to make Jehovah happy and to consider the feelings of our brothers. What's next?

01:13:04.789 --> 01:13:15.029
Number three, have I asked for counsel? Have you got that? Have I asked for counsel?

01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:21.189
Now maybe the elders haven't dealt with the exact situation we're facing, but they know a lot of

01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:27.350
people. They may know someone who has dealt with the situation before and seen how we handled it.

01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:33.670
Or they may know about the effect the decision had on others. For example, they might know how the

01:13:33.670 --> 01:13:40.470
congregation reacted the last time someone attended a wedding or a funeral in a church.

01:13:42.710 --> 01:13:48.149
Another situation where brothers often ask for the help of the elders involves the use of

01:13:48.149 --> 01:13:56.789
blood fractions. Should we accept them or not? The governing body has refused to impose its conscience

01:13:56.789 --> 01:14:03.109
on the brotherhood. What do we know? We know that the Bible says to abstain from blood.

01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:11.670
But as you divide it into fractions, and the fractions get tinier and tinier, at what point does

01:14:11.670 --> 01:14:20.229
blood stop being blood? Each one will have to decide that for himself. Now some might say, well,

01:14:20.229 --> 01:14:24.949
if it's a really, really tiny fraction, it doesn't bother me to take it. But others will say,

01:14:24.949 --> 01:14:32.789
it doesn't matter to me if it's from blood, I don't want it. And their conscience also has to be

01:14:32.789 --> 01:14:42.869
respected. Now let's illustrate. Air is made up of nitrogen and oxygen. And together,

01:14:42.869 --> 01:14:52.470
they make up 99 percent of air. That leaves 1 percent. The 1 percent is made up of a variety of

01:14:52.470 --> 01:15:02.789
gases, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, neon, small fractions. When it comes to small fractions, elders

01:15:02.789 --> 01:15:08.550
need to be careful, though, not to insert their personal opinion into the discussion, such as by

01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:14.310
saying, I wouldn't take any of it. They should simply help the publisher to reason on the basic

01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:22.149
principles and let him make up his own mind. So where are we? We make sure, hold the happy. We

01:15:22.149 --> 01:15:31.750
consider the feelings of our brothers and sisters. We ask for counsel. Number four, did I take the time?

01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:40.390
Did I take the time to meditate prayerfully before making my decision?

01:15:41.109 --> 01:15:46.229
Your goal is to make Jehovah happy. So you wouldn't want to make your decision hastily and then

01:15:46.229 --> 01:16:01.270
ask Jehovah to bless it. We should ask Jehovah for guidance first, rather than asking him to bless

01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:09.029
a decision we've already made. Have you ever heard someone say, that doesn't bother my conscience?

01:16:09.989 --> 01:16:17.510
We might ask, how did he come to that conclusion? Did he follow the four steps we just mentioned?

01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:24.069
Did he do research to learn what makes Jehovah happy? Did he think about how others might be

01:16:24.069 --> 01:16:32.789
affected? Did he ask for counsel? And did he meditate prayerfully on his decision? Or is he just

01:16:32.869 --> 01:16:40.949
following his feelings? Following your feelings isn't the same as following a Bible-trained

01:16:40.949 --> 01:16:48.390
conscience. I'm going to repeat that. Following your feelings is not the same as following a

01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:56.069
Bible-trained conscience. Our conscience needs to be trained in harmony with scriptural principles.

01:16:56.869 --> 01:17:01.909
Now, Paul's counsel conscience didn't bother him a bit when he was persecuting Christians. He

01:17:01.909 --> 01:17:07.750
thought he was doing Jehovah favor. But when he realized how Jehovah felt about it, he knew he

01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:13.750
had to change. We have to be sure that we're really getting Jehovah's thinking on matters.

01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:26.659
Remember Jeremiah 17 and verse 9. Simple expression but so true. Jeremiah chapter 17

01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:41.560
and verse 9. It says, the heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate. Who can know it?

01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:51.399
The heart is treacherous. We might allow our emotions to get the better of us. For example,

01:17:51.399 --> 01:17:56.760
when a family member is disfellowshipped. If the person is living outside the home, we know that we

01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:03.479
should limit our association to necessary family business. Now, if the family was never very close,

01:18:03.479 --> 01:18:10.760
that might not be a problem. But suppose family ties are really strong. That can be a challenge.

01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:16.920
If we allow ourselves to be ruled by emotion rather than by scriptural principles,

01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:23.479
we could stretch the meaning of necessary family business to include almost any activity.

01:18:24.199 --> 01:18:27.239
The heart is treacherous.

01:18:29.239 --> 01:18:34.600
Asking ourselves the four questions we just mentioned can help us to make decisions based on

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:43.239
godly principles rather than simply relying on our feelings. Now, let's see how mature Christians

01:18:43.239 --> 01:18:51.239
can apply these principles and how the elders can help. The following video interviews are about

01:18:51.239 --> 01:18:57.479
weddings and funerals, a touchy subject and many cultures, as you will see.

01:19:03.689 --> 01:19:10.090
In Japan, religious rituals are associated with each stage of life and with each season of the year.

01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:17.579
As Jehovah's Witnesses, we want to keep the cleanliness and unity of the congregation.

01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:24.699
In this regard, one of the most delicate areas is the decision on whether to attend a

01:19:24.699 --> 01:19:33.510
non-Witness funeral or not. The first thing we must consider regarding funerals is not to be

01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:40.760
involved in religious rituals, the acts of worship that are condemned by the Bible. In harmony with

01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:47.079
the principle of the 2 Corinthians chapter 6 and verse 14, we need to keep completely separate

01:19:47.079 --> 01:19:55.180
from pagan acts of worship. Next, even if we don't participate in the worship of other religions,

01:19:55.739 --> 01:20:00.140
we need to consider if our decisions could stumble someone in the congregation.

01:20:02.779 --> 01:20:09.100
When we consider the Bible principle in Luke chapter 17, verse 2, we do not want our decisions to

01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:19.939
hinder the faith of someone in the congregation. The third point to think about is our conscience.

01:20:21.699 --> 01:20:27.060
We need to seriously think about the Bible principle in Galatians chapter 6, verse 5,

01:20:27.699 --> 01:20:35.260
where it says that each must carry his own load. This Bible principle also applies when elders

01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:42.859
want to support others. Of course, those in the congregation can ask the elders for support

01:20:42.859 --> 01:20:50.619
in issues related to funerals. However, in matters of conscience, elders cannot force decisions

01:20:50.619 --> 01:20:58.279
on others. So it would be wrong to make some kind of rule regarding attending non-Witness funerals.

01:20:58.359 --> 01:21:07.180
If each person can make decisions based on Bible principles, we can have a truly peaceful and free

01:21:07.180 --> 01:21:15.939
atmosphere, where each individual's differing situation is respected. This would really contribute

01:21:15.939 --> 01:21:22.500
to the unity of the congregation, and all can maintain a clean conscience and serve happily

01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:32.840
before Jehovah. In my culture, specifically the Namibian-Oshihuambo culture, like in many African

01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:39.560
cultures, there are many spurtistic customs related to weddings that are included in wedding

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:45.319
celebrations. Unfortunately, my family is not in the truth. So obviously for Ben and I, that was

01:21:45.319 --> 01:21:50.920
one of the main concerns. They don't understand our worship of Jehovah and they don't understand

01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:57.239
that we apply Bible principles and not a tradition of men. We got engaged before the pandemic,

01:21:57.239 --> 01:22:02.199
but obviously now that our wedding was to be over video conferencing, it meant that we didn't have

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:07.319
control over many things. We tried to imagine situations that could stumble our

01:22:07.319 --> 01:22:16.329
brothers or disrupt the unity in the congregation. We had to, in advance, think of Bible principles

01:22:16.329 --> 01:22:21.930
that would apply in our case, but particularly what we also found helpful was speaking to a mature

01:22:21.930 --> 01:22:30.489
elder. He gave us a principle in Proverbs 14, verse 15. He told us to be very careful when people say,

01:22:31.130 --> 01:22:37.609
I will do this or I won't do this at your wedding. Basically, it was up to us to make sure that

01:22:37.609 --> 01:22:42.970
the proceedings or things that happened at our wedding would be in order and in harmony with

01:22:42.970 --> 01:22:49.770
Bible principles. Another principle that came to mind was first Corinthians 10, verse 23.

01:22:50.329 --> 01:22:56.569
So obviously we knew that we had the right to do many things, but we were also very conscious of

01:22:56.649 --> 01:23:03.930
how our brothers would view our wedding. We didn't want anybody to be at our wedding and feel embarrassed

01:23:03.930 --> 01:23:11.770
or even stumble to be there. Now looking back at our wedding, we look back with fond memories.

01:23:13.369 --> 01:23:21.449
So applying Bible principle doesn't restrict our fun. Also it contributed to the unity

01:23:21.529 --> 01:23:26.409
among our brothers because all of us, those prisons, those who were invited, we were able to enjoy

01:23:26.409 --> 01:23:31.689
the wedding. You're not worried about, oh, did that thing offend anybody? So you're able to

01:23:31.689 --> 01:23:44.020
and enjoy the day without any bad memories. As you can see, our brothers in many countries are

01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:49.699
faced with very difficult decisions where weddings and funerals are concerned. The guidance

01:23:49.699 --> 01:23:57.060
the elders can provide is invaluable. Now sometimes medical doctors complain that their

01:23:57.060 --> 01:24:02.260
witness patients are inconsistent because we don't all have the same view of certain medical

01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:08.260
treatments. One witness patient accepts certain fractions or therapies, so the doctor figures

01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:14.340
he knows what Jehovah's Witnesses believe. But then the next patient comes along and he rejects

01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:21.220
them all. The doctor is confused. Those doctors don't understand the role of the conscience.

01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:26.579
We shouldn't worry when medical professionals don't understand our differing viewpoints because

01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:33.140
we should be glad that we serve a God who dignifies us with the freedom to make many of our own

01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:40.380
decisions. Now the Apostle Paul mentioned four qualities that will help us to maintain the

01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:46.539
uniting bond of peace. And we're going to find those qualities at Ephesians chapter 4 and we're

01:24:46.539 --> 01:24:55.659
going to zero in on verse 2. Let's turn to Ephesians chapter 4 and we're going to look at verse 2.

01:24:55.659 --> 01:25:02.300
Now we read verses 3 to 6 earlier and you know that Paul was concerned about unity. Unity is what

01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:08.220
he had on his mind. And now he's telling us that these four qualities are going to help us to

01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:15.979
maintain our unity, earnestly endeavoring. Remember what he said, earnestly endeavoring to maintain

01:25:15.979 --> 01:25:25.260
the oneness of the Spirit, the work that we need to put into promoting unity. Verse 2 with all

01:25:25.260 --> 01:25:37.739
humility and mildness with patience putting up with one another in love. Isn't that beautiful?

01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:48.699
You notice the qualities, humility, mildness, patience and love. When we're humble we recognize

01:25:48.699 --> 01:25:55.020
that our opinion isn't always the right one. Humility will also prevent us from trying to impose

01:25:55.020 --> 01:26:02.619
our conscience on others as if Jehovah had appointed us to judge them. What about mildness?

01:26:03.420 --> 01:26:08.460
Mildness will help us to think about the effect our words might have on our brothers and sisters.

01:26:09.420 --> 01:26:15.579
We would never want to hurt them even when we strongly disagree with them and we should give

01:26:15.579 --> 01:26:23.899
them the benefit of the doubt. If someone says something that makes you mad, pray before you speak.

01:26:24.859 --> 01:26:37.819
Pray before you speak. Love covers a multitude of sins which contributes to the peace of the congregation.

01:26:38.779 --> 01:26:44.779
And we deeply appreciate it when our brothers are patient with us. In turn, we need to be patient

01:26:44.779 --> 01:26:51.819
with them because we're all at different stages of spiritual growth and we have to acknowledge that.

01:26:54.060 --> 01:27:00.220
Well, we've talked about making Jehovah happy with our decisions. We can also please Jehovah

01:27:00.220 --> 01:27:06.460
when we work hard to promote peace in the congregation. And sometimes it does take an earnest

01:27:06.460 --> 01:27:13.020
endeavor sometimes we have to work hard at ensuring that the congregation is at peace. What about

01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:20.859
the elders? The elders take the lead in working together in unity. They should always speak with

01:27:20.859 --> 01:27:27.500
the united voice. If they don't, the congregation will sense that they're divided and this will make

01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:34.539
the brothers and sisters uneasy. Any difference of opinion should we work down in private while showing

01:27:34.539 --> 01:27:42.300
deep respect for one another. Just because someone disagrees with us doesn't make him a bad person,

01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:49.100
we have to understand that. And his difference of opinion may search us through it. It may be

01:27:49.100 --> 01:27:54.380
something that we need to think about and consider. And we always consider that the other person

01:27:54.380 --> 01:28:01.180
may be right. What about us publishers? If we're having a hard time getting along with someone,

01:28:01.180 --> 01:28:06.939
rather than asking Jehovah to change him, we should ask Jehovah to mold us like the great

01:28:06.939 --> 01:28:13.340
potter he is. We should ask him to show us why he drew that person to the congregation. Remember

01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:21.100
what Jesus said? No one comes to him unless the father draws him. What does Jehovah see in that person

01:28:21.739 --> 01:28:29.979
that we aren't seeing? We each have a responsibility to contribute to the peace and unity of the

01:28:29.979 --> 01:28:38.520
congregation. May Jehovah bless us as we work toward that goal. Thank you, brother,

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:45.800
explain for that motivating talk. We are determined to do our part to safeguard our

01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:57.000
uniting bond of peace. This session has provided such practical lessons. What can we look forward to

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:05.239
in the next session? The Scripture theme will be Romans chapter 15 verse 13, which says in part,

01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:14.840
may the God who gives hope, fill you with all joy and peace. The program will feature a seven-part

01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:22.760
symposium with Bible examples of those who sowed and reaped peace. We will also want to invite

01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:31.079
as many as possible to enjoy the public Bible discourse entitled Friendship with God. How possible?

01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:40.520
Now let's sing together song number 113, which draws attention to what it means to have

01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:50.439
godly peace. The song is entitled Our Possession of Peace. After the song, you may have your local

01:29:50.439 --> 01:30:01.800
concluding prayer. Again, that song number 113.
