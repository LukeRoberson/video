00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:07.389
The theme for our program this month is treasure Jehovah's Reminders,

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:14.390
and it's based on Psalm 19.7, where we're told

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:22.390
the reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy, making the inexperienced one wise.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.390
In the original language, the word he had translated as reminder

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.390
comes from a root word meaning to go over again to repeat.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.390
Reminders have always been an essential part of Jehovah's teaching.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:45.390
In ancient Israel, God's people continually received commandments, regulations, and reminders.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.390
In fact, Jehovah tells us that he sent his prophets again and again

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.390
to repeatedly remind his people of their responsibilities.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.390
The Apostle Peter felt the need to give reminders

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.390
even to those who were well established in the truth.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.390
Notice how he describes this as second Peter 1, 12 and 13.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.390
For this reason, I intend always to remind you of these things,

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.390
although you know them, and are well established in the truth that is present in you.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.390
But I consider it right as long as I'm in this tabernacle

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.390
to stir you with reminders.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:33.390
In verse 15, he goes on to give the reason why he felt the need to give the brothers reminders.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.390
He says, I will always do my utmost so that after my departure,

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.390
you may be able to recall these things for yourselves.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.390
So Peter was determined to help the brothers and sisters in his day

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.390
to remember or recall the teachings they had already learned.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.390
It shouldn't come as a surprise then if today a lot of our teaching involves reminders.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:07.390
It follows the pattern set by Jehovah in ancient Israel and with the first century Christians.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.389
But why do we need reminders?

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.389
Let's consider three reasons.

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:18.389
First, let's look at Psalm 103 verse 2.

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:22.389
There it says, let me praise Jehovah.

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:25.389
May I never forget all that he has done.

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:28.389
Why then do we need reminders?

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:31.389
Simply put, because we forget.

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:36.389
If we had perfect memories, we wouldn't need so many reminders.

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:41.389
Even in everyday life, many of us use little nuts to remind ourselves of what we need to do.

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:47.389
And who of us hasn't seen the need for a list of reminders when going shopping,

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:55.389
only to realize when we return that we forgot to get one of the important items we needed to purchase.

00:02:55.389 --> 00:03:03.389
If reminders are important in everyday life, how much more so in matters that involve our relationship with Jehovah?

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:08.389
Let's read Luke 10 verses 39 and 40.

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:11.389
Speaking of Martha, we are told.

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:19.389
She also had a sister called Mary, who sat down at the feet of the Lord and kept listening to what he was saying.

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:25.389
Martha, on the other hand, was distracted with attending to many duties.

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:30.389
What was Martha's problem? She was distracted.

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:38.389
So the second reason why we need reminders is that like Martha, at times we too become distracted.

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:45.389
Although we may already know a vital fact, that fact might get put into the back of our mind figuratively speaking,

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.389
because other matters are demanding our attention.

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:52.389
Satan is the great distractor.

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:57.389
He tries to turn our attention away from the true issues of our day.

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:05.389
People in general have become more and more distracted by entertainment and other non-essential matters.

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:13.389
No wonder that Satan has succeeded in misleading so many. They don't even realize what has happened.

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:20.389
Reason number three is alluded to at Matthew 24 verse 45.

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.389
Who really is the faithful and discrete slave?

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:30.389
Who is master appointed over his domestics to give them their food at the proper time?

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:35.389
Notice that the spiritual food is given to us at the proper time.

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:39.389
Our circumstances in life are continually changing.

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:43.389
How often do we hear that was just what I needed?

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.389
We've all experienced that haven't we?

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.389
So what are three of the reasons why we need reminders?

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.389
One, because we tend to forget things.

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.389
Two, we often become distracted.

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:07.389
Three, our changed circumstances may require a reminder of something we already knew but didn't fully need at that time.

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:10.389
So that brings us to the next question.

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.389
What will help us to remember?

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:20.389
It's interesting to note that Jehovah has used many ways to remind his people of what they should do.

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:31.389
At numbers chapter 10 verse 10, we've told that the various festivals were given as reminders, especially the celebration of the Passover.

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:42.389
That means that every time the Israelites prepared and celebrated one of these festivals, they will remind it of important matters, such as how Jehovah provides for his people.

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:46.389
And how he has saved them in the past.

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:51.389
Something similar happens today at the commemoration of the Lord's Eve, the meal.

00:05:51.389 --> 00:06:04.389
Not only do we hear the reminders from God's Word, but the act of passing the bread and wine also serves as an action that reminds us of what Jesus did in our behalf.

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:11.389
But what do we need to do in order for those reminders to have a beneficial impact on our lives?

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:17.389
Notice what Psalm 119 verse 99 says.

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:26.389
It tells us, I have more insight than all my teachers because I ponder over your reminders.

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:29.389
Yes, we need to ponder over these reminders.

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:38.389
That means not just listening to or reading them, but it involves thinking deeply about them, meditating on their value.

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:47.389
Just to listen or read without meditating is like looking through the lens of a movie camera without pressing the record button.

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:52.389
We see things and hear things, but nothing is recorded.

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:59.389
So we need to meditate, visualize and review these reminders.

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:02.389
This will help us to remember what we learn.

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:09.389
But figuratively speaking, there is something else that we can do to press the record button.

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:14.389
That means we don't have to wait for someone else to give us a reminder.

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:17.389
We can make our own reminder.

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:20.389
How can we do so?

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:28.389
The answer to that question is highlighted in Jehovah's instructions to Moses as found at Exodus 1714.

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:39.389
Jehovah now said to Moses, write this as a memorial or the footnote says, reminder in the book and repeat it to Joshua.

00:07:39.389 --> 00:07:41.389
What's the point?

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:45.389
Write down new things we want to remember.

00:07:45.389 --> 00:07:52.389
Some brothers use a notebook or exercise book to write down a list of interesting points that they want to remember.

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:58.389
Then they look through the book from time to time to remind themselves of those points.

00:07:58.389 --> 00:08:03.389
Many of us do this with our notes from conventions and assemblies.

00:08:03.389 --> 00:08:08.389
Of course, to do that successfully, you need to remember where you put the notebook.

00:08:08.389 --> 00:08:14.389
Additionally, we have to be careful that we don't write down every little fact.

00:08:14.389 --> 00:08:19.389
Otherwise, we may become overwhelmed with all the information.

00:08:19.389 --> 00:08:27.389
We can make these notes either on paper or electronically using computers or electronic devices.

00:08:27.389 --> 00:08:33.389
Whatever system we use, let's make lists of things that we want to remember.

00:08:33.389 --> 00:08:38.389
Many brothers have found it good to have two separate lists.

00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:46.389
One list could be subjects, perhaps points that we want to use in the ministry or in our own lives.

00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:53.389
Another, scriptures, explanations that clarify the meaning of certain verses.

00:08:53.389 --> 00:08:59.389
With regard to notes on scriptures, let's ask a very important question.

00:08:59.389 --> 00:09:03.389
Do you have a study Bible?

00:09:03.389 --> 00:09:05.389
What is a study Bible?

00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:10.389
Perhaps it's a separate Bible to the one you take in the ministry.

00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:16.389
It's a Bible for you to write in so that you're reminded of things that you've learned.

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:20.389
These are some of the things we can do with the study Bible.

00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:24.389
Highlight or underlying some words or verses.

00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:27.389
That will make it easier to find them again.

00:09:27.389 --> 00:09:33.389
But remember, not to make too many highlights or marks, otherwise nothing will stand out.

00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:42.389
Write a summary of points and scriptures you want to remember on the blank pages in the front or the back of your Bible.

00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:47.389
Write notes in the margin. That's what Gilead students often do.

00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:54.389
Of course, you need the right type of pen or pencil that won't bleed through to the other side of the page.

00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:58.389
What type of things could you write in the margin?

00:09:58.389 --> 00:10:04.389
Perhaps new points that you learn while reading magazines or attending meetings and assemblies.

00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:14.389
If you learn a new point, ask yourself what verses being explained and then write a brief comment in the margin next to that verse.

00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:17.389
Let's take an example.

00:10:17.389 --> 00:10:25.389
Perhaps you are reading the sermon on the Mount and you get to Matthew 7 verses 24 through 27.

00:10:25.389 --> 00:10:32.389
That's the illustration about the two men who build houses, one on sand and the other on rock.

00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:38.389
As you research this in Watchtower Library or the Research Guide, you come across the article,

00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:46.389
are you building on sand or on rock in the November 1, 2008 Watchtower?

00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:51.389
What points could you write in the margin to help you remember the explanation?

00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:57.389
Perhaps you could write sand equals build on the surface.

00:10:57.389 --> 00:11:02.389
Rock equals dig down deep.

00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:06.389
Digging equals doing and applying.

00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:10.389
You might even put Luke 6, 46 through 48 there.

00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:16.389
If you still have room and you're writing a small, you could add something like this.

00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:20.389
Not here as only but doers.

00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:28.389
Both houses in same location, same tests, foundations different.

00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:34.389
Now every time you read those verses, you'll be reminded of what they mean.

00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:39.389
Perhaps like me, you've had several study Bibles over the years.

00:11:39.389 --> 00:11:44.389
I think back to the first one I used, it was like this big green Bible.

00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:50.389
Then later that was replaced by another Bible, this black covered Bible.

00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:56.389
And then further still we had another Bible, the reference Bible.

00:11:56.389 --> 00:12:02.389
And of course now for most of us we have a large print Bible.

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:07.389
This does however highlight a challenge we might experience.

00:12:07.389 --> 00:12:11.389
It can be frustrating when a new edition of the Bible comes out.

00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:16.389
How do you transfer all your study notes over to the new Bible?

00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:27.389
Additionally, our beloved study Bible may wear out or will still be lost, stolen, burned, ruined, run over, blown away.

00:12:27.389 --> 00:12:32.389
So that's the advantage of using an electronic list.

00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:37.389
It doesn't matter what type of file you use, it can be updated very easily.

00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:45.389
And you can even make copies, not like the print copy that already has the old idea written in the margin.

00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:56.389
Even now in English we have the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke in our electronic study Bible on JW.org and WOL.

00:12:56.389 --> 00:13:03.389
Later in the program we have some exciting news about how JW Library will help us in this regard.

00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:06.389
But I'll leave that for later.

00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:15.389
Really, having a study Bible is not only helpful, but it also makes our personal study far more interesting.

00:13:15.389 --> 00:13:17.389
How so?

00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:26.389
Every time we read or study a publication, we'll find ourselves searching for new points that we can write in our study Bible.

00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:34.389
This way we'll be doing what the Psalmist expressed at Psalm 119, verse 111.

00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:43.389
We will take Jehovah's Reminders as our permanent possession or heritage for his reminders are the joy of our hearts.
