00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.060
Do you think it's about time you had more freedom?

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:15.660
You may think you're ready to be treated as an adult, but do your parents agree?

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:32.460
Have you proven to them that you can handle more freedom?

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.539
You see, if you want more freedom, you have to gain your parents' trust.

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.140
Earning their trust takes time.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.740
But every time you prove yourself responsible, you get one step closer to your goal.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.780
In ways you can show your trust worthy are diligently completing your chores, especially

00:00:51.780 --> 00:01:00.869
without being reminded, managing your time wisely, and being punctual, taking care of

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:09.329
your things, showing that you can handle money in a responsible way, and following through

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:11.010
on the promises you make.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:20.540
Of course, nobody's perfect, so if you make a mistake, it's not the end of the world.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.099
Call the Bible's advice at Hebrews 13-18, to conduct yourself honestly and all things.

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:29.019
Tell the truth and be straightforward.

00:01:29.019 --> 00:01:33.260
If you admit your mistake and apologize, your parents will see that you are willing to

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.219
take responsibility for your actions, and they'll appreciate your honesty.

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:42.340
But what if you feel that despite your best efforts, your parents still aren't giving

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.579
you enough freedom?

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.140
Don't just get annoyed, talk to them.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.340
Respectfully ask what they think you need to do to earn their trust.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:00.400
You may be surprised to learn of some other areas where you can show your responsible.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.719
At 2 Corinthians 13-5, the Bible says, keep proving what you are.

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.039
So you need to build up a record of consistency.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.599
That way, you'll prove you're worthy of trust.

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.639
Every step you take brings you closer to your goal.

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:21.520
Of course, trust is much harder to gain than it is to lose.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.479
But the effort is worth it.

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:28.520
When your parents see you working hard to earn their trust, they will likely be happy to

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.280
give you more freedom, and you'll be another step closer to becoming a responsible adult.
