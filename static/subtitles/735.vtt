WEBVTT

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.379
Now, we have the opportunity to enjoy this edition

00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:08.820
that we're accustomed to of the inside story.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.660
And it's hosted by another instructor,

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.179
Brother Trent Liphole.

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:41.740
Enjoy it.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.579
The past year has been a period of change

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.659
for all of Jehovah's people.

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:50.579
We've had to show flexibility, caution, and reasonableness.

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.100
Here at Gilead, for us too, Class 150

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.140
has presented us with change.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.500
For example, all the students of Class 150

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.939
are from or serving in the United States.

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:05.219
Five couples in one single brother

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:07.659
all serve in the circuit work.

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.540
That represents approximately 50% of the class.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.659
Today, we're going to meet three couples

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.140
from different parts of the United States

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.819
and see how they learn to cope with change in their lives.

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:23.019
And how they, like the Apostle Paul,

00:01:23.019 --> 00:01:26.219
worked to become all things to all people.

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:27.900
So let's meet our first guests,

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.859
Joey and Taylor Bornshine, from the state of Texas.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.510
Joey and Taylor, welcome to the inside story.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.510
Great to have you with us.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.349
Thank you.

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:49.469
You're from the big state of Texas.

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:51.230
Where specifically are you from?

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.549
From Dallas.

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.109
Dallas, Texas, all right.

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:56.750
Well, again, nice to have you with us.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.790
To come to Gilead, here you are in the 150th class,

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.950
and it all starts with regular pioneering.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.430
So how did you both start regular pioneering,

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.230
maybe Joey, how did you start?

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.270
So for me, I feel very grateful that my foundation

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.629
starts a long time ago with my family,

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.509
especially with my grandparents.

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:17.590
They were the couple that, after they got married,

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.310
they really just wanted to serve Jehovah

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.509
the best way they could.

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:22.990
They would ask circuit overseers where they could move

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.270
that needed help.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.349
If they were ever asked to go to another congregation,

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.270
they would always do it right away.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.629
And so that really affected my mom,

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.189
which in turn affected me.

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:35.389
How did that affect you?

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:38.909
So for a while, after my parents got married,

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.949
they might have just gotten a little distracted

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:44.229
with marriage, family, taking care of the family.

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:47.270
But at one point, they made a move across the country.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.750
And they used that as an opportunity to simplify.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.110
And my mom was able to start regular pioneering at that time.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.909
And I just, I remember as a child,

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.310
how different both of my parents were,

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.069
just in their happiness and in life in general,

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.389
because she was able to do more for Jehovah.

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:06.310
Nice.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.270
How old were you when that happened

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.509
when your mom started pioneering

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:10.909
and you saw this change?

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:11.949
I was about nine.

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:12.710
OK.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.389
And so when did you start regular pioneering then?

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.189
So actually the next year, my sister

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:21.069
and I both got to join her pioneering.

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.389
So you were 10 years old.

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:24.389
That is amazing.

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:25.990
10 years old, starting pioneering.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.830
Great.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.270
What about you, Taylor, how did you

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.349
get your start in regular pioneering?

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.310
So we pioneered in Texas, but I'm originally from Colorado.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.830
So my parents, like Joey, said a really good example for me.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.389
Most of my life, they pioneered as a couple.

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:44.509
And so pioneering was always just something, full-time service

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:46.629
was something that I grew up with.

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:48.110
Then I was in my mid teens.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.710
My parents got appointed into the substitute circuit work.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:52.830
That was fun.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.389
On the weekends, I would travel with them

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:55.590
to visit congregations.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.550
I was in public schools.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.229
I couldn't go with them during the week.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.629
And I appreciated about them.

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.310
That it wasn't just what they said,

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.189
but they set the example by what they did.

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:05.789
OK, I mean, that must have been cool.

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:08.150
You got to be parents and they're in the substitute circuit work.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.750
But personally, how did that affect you?

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.389
Yeah, so that was just some good motivation

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:13.669
for me to start pioneering.

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:16.230
I graduated about six months early,

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.670
a semester early, and then started pioneering.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.189
And then as soon as I was able to, I hit 19

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:23.310
and submitted an application for Bethel.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.870
And soon thereafter, I was accepted

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.110
and was able to spend a few years in Brooklyn.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.110
OK.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.470
After that, I know you left Bethel a tube you got married

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.350
or you're there, regular pioneering in Dallas.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.829
What made the difference for you,

00:04:36.829 --> 00:04:40.269
for you to reach out and progress in Jehovah's Service?

00:04:40.269 --> 00:04:43.149
So we were pioneering as a young couple.

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:46.069
We had goals, but it can be hard when you're new,

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:48.550
trying to figure marriage out some distractions

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.389
or maybe even just knowing what direction you should take.

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.110
So we just feel so thankful to Jehovah,

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.910
whether we had some very instrumental circuit overseer

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.230
couples that came just at the right time.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.670
We've tried to express it to them,

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.790
but I don't think they'll ever fully understand

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.910
the impact that they've had on our lives.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.470
Well, that is one of the great things

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.470
about the impact of those in the circuit work,

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.709
what they do for young people, for young ones.

00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:15.069
And I think we're also grateful for that.

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:17.750
Would you say then that was that your inspiration

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.910
to get into the circuit work?

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.110
Not really.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.149
We actually had different goals.

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:27.189
We really wanted to go to Bethel together as a couple.

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:30.790
So we applied and applied, and it just didn't seem to happen.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.990
But you ended up in the circuit work.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.350
So I wonder what changed then?

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.589
Did it just grow on you or what happened?

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:39.350
Well, one day we opened up a piece of mail

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.629
and it was a questionnaire for the substitute circuit work.

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:46.389
So while that might not have been the direction

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:47.670
that we thought we would go down,

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:48.829
it seemed like that was the path

00:05:48.829 --> 00:05:50.350
that Jehovah laid out in front of us.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.550
So we happily accepted.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.750
And little by little, it started to grow on us,

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.149
the idea of the circuit work.

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:57.550
We were then able to attend school

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.470
for kingdom evangelizers,

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.310
where it just continued to get training,

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.389
motivation to do what Jehovah wants us to do.

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:06.069
And so after our graduation,

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:07.110
within just a few months,

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.870
we were appointed into the circuit work

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.269
and we love the circuit work.

00:06:12.269 --> 00:06:13.829
Where was your first circuit, Joy?

00:06:13.829 --> 00:06:16.310
So we went to the suburbs of Chicago.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.069
So it was great.

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:20.189
Big city of Dallas, to the big city of Chicago.

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:23.029
What did you think of Chicago?

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:26.110
It was everything that I could want in a circuit.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.870
So two big city people from Dallas,

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.670
now to Chicago, even bigger city.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.269
We love diversity,

00:06:32.269 --> 00:06:34.350
love background, culture, race,

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:35.350
and it had everything.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:36.509
So we were just eating it up.

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:39.430
We loved being in the Chicago area.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.790
It sounds like a butt's coming for change.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.870
What changed for you both?

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.829
So after just about six months of being in that circuit,

00:06:46.829 --> 00:06:48.910
still falling in love with the circuit work,

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:50.790
we got to call from the branch office

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.149
that we were now being reassigned

00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:53.550
to a different circuit,

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:54.750
further north,

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:58.509
and a more rural circuit in Wisconsin.

00:06:58.509 --> 00:06:59.829
Okay, Wisconsin.

00:06:59.829 --> 00:07:01.629
Well, what did you think?

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:02.470
Tell us about it.

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.149
What was Wisconsin like for you Taylor?

00:07:05.149 --> 00:07:06.990
So very different,

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.829
big city people going into a rural circuit

00:07:09.829 --> 00:07:13.629
that was mostly dairy farm communities.

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:15.949
So out of my element,

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:18.110
we would drive for miles and miles

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:19.110
when we were out in service,

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:23.790
no stores or shops or bathrooms or coffee shops.

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.990
So it was a little getting used to.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.269
Timing was probably now became something you had to learn.

00:07:28.269 --> 00:07:29.110
Right, good.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.350
What about for you Joey coming from Dallas?

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.230
What was it like for you?

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:37.189
For me, the big change was the weather, the winters.

00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:39.350
We didn't have extreme winters in Dallas

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:43.189
and Wisconsin had very long, very cold winters.

00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:47.069
So we invested in really good coats, wool leggings,

00:07:47.069 --> 00:07:48.790
great boots.

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.149
I jokingly told Taylor some mornings I would wake up

00:07:51.149 --> 00:07:53.589
and feel exhausted just getting dressed in the morning.

00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:56.110
Putting on so much, I guess that also affected

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.350
bathroom breaks and things like that.

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.389
New skills you're learning in Wisconsin.

00:08:00.389 --> 00:08:01.069
Right.

00:08:01.069 --> 00:08:04.910
What helped you to adjust to this new change?

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.550
So although it was a different environment,

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:10.949
it was just beautiful to see that it was cold outside,

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:12.910
but that didn't affect the friends, their hearts,

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:15.550
they were warm and their service to Jehovah,

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:18.629
they were so warm in the way that they treated us.

00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:22.149
It just adopted us so quickly into a different environment.

00:08:22.149 --> 00:08:25.069
Are we very, very quickly fell in love

00:08:25.069 --> 00:08:26.870
with the friends in Wisconsin?

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.709
Jehovah's people are amazing, aren't they?

00:08:28.709 --> 00:08:29.910
What about you, Joey?

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:32.190
What would you say helped you to adjust?

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:33.830
Well, of course, like Taylor said,

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.710
the love from the friends it helped us immediately.

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.590
But we also actually learned new waves to have fun

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:41.549
that we never did in Dallas.

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:43.750
Yeah, you brought a picture, this photograph,

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.269
great picture, obviously having fun there.

00:08:46.269 --> 00:08:47.909
Joey, what can you tell us about it?

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.629
So this is actually a gathering that we went to

00:08:50.629 --> 00:08:52.669
on the middle of a frozen lake.

00:08:52.669 --> 00:08:54.470
And this is actually a size fishing.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:55.389
Did you catch anything?

00:08:55.389 --> 00:08:56.389
We did.

00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:58.110
You're telling yourself you're not in Dallas.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.350
You're not in the North.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:00.110
Great.

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:02.429
There's also another photo, and I love this one.

00:09:02.429 --> 00:09:04.429
What can you tell us about this Taylor?

00:09:04.429 --> 00:09:05.629
So there's a brother in the circuit

00:09:05.629 --> 00:09:07.389
who raised beef cattle.

00:09:07.389 --> 00:09:10.429
So I got to spend some time getting to pet the little guy

00:09:10.429 --> 00:09:11.950
and also a hand feeding it.

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:14.429
So amazing experience, not something

00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:17.870
that I would have been able to do in downtown Chicago

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:18.909
or downtown Dallas.

00:09:18.909 --> 00:09:20.870
If you're really there just becoming all things

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:25.110
to all people, what would you say you learned

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:29.230
from the changes you've gone through in your lives?

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:31.110
So if I'm just being honest, the circuit work

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:34.070
was not something that I had a desire to do.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:38.750
I didn't feel like it would make me comfortable or happy.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:41.750
But Jehovah, at times, puts things in front of us

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:43.950
that we might not think that we would like or make us

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:46.629
comfortable, but it does.

00:09:46.669 --> 00:09:48.789
And I'm so glad that he did allow us

00:09:48.789 --> 00:09:51.309
to have the opportunity to be into the circuit work

00:09:51.309 --> 00:09:53.950
because we love the circuit work.

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:56.190
So just a nice little reminder that Jehovah

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:58.470
will choose things for us or put things in front of us

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:00.789
that maybe we don't think is going to make us happy

00:10:00.789 --> 00:10:03.110
or it's not going to make us comfortable

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.950
and how we feel with a circumstance or environment.

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:08.350
But that Jehovah always chooses what's best for us

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:10.309
if we just let him do it.

00:10:10.309 --> 00:10:11.269
What would you say, Joey?

00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:12.870
What did you learn?

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.549
I think for me, anytime there's a change,

00:10:15.549 --> 00:10:17.710
there's always going to be a little bit of anxiety

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:19.549
and certain tease worries.

00:10:19.549 --> 00:10:22.669
I just really learned to just leave it in Jehovah's hands

00:10:22.669 --> 00:10:24.710
to pray to him about it because a lot of times

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:26.110
those things never even happen.

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:27.870
They never even come true.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:31.230
So whatever Jehovah asks of us, we will be able

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:34.350
to get through it because either they won't happen

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.230
or Jehovah will help us and bless us through them.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.230
Those are two great lessons that you learned.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:40.830
Thank you so much for sharing them with us.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.950
And those are two lessons that will probably help you out

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:46.470
in the changes that are to come in your life.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:47.750
Taylor and Joey, thank you so much

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:49.149
for being with us on the Inside Story.

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:50.909
Thank you. Thank you.

00:10:50.909 --> 00:10:53.230
Let's welcome our next guests coming from the state

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:56.110
of Michigan, Ben and Whitney Fry.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.379
Ben and Whitney, thank you for being with us

00:11:10.379 --> 00:11:11.820
on the Inside Story.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:15.059
You've come to Gilead from the circuit work

00:11:15.059 --> 00:11:18.539
and the circuit work also starts with regular pioneering.

00:11:18.539 --> 00:11:20.179
So maybe you can tell us how did you, Whitney,

00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:22.059
how did you start regular pioneering?

00:11:22.059 --> 00:11:24.860
So my mom taught me the truth when I was growing up

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.700
and I loved Jehovah, but by late teens,

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.419
I didn't really know what I wanted to do with my life.

00:11:30.419 --> 00:11:33.419
I had a girlfriend who invited me to support her

00:11:33.419 --> 00:11:35.379
at a funeral of a young brother

00:11:35.379 --> 00:11:37.820
who had passed away in a tragic accident.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:38.820
That's interesting.

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:41.019
Maybe you could make, what's the connection

00:11:41.019 --> 00:11:43.259
starting pioneering of a funeral?

00:11:43.259 --> 00:11:44.899
Maybe you could make the connection for us.

00:11:44.899 --> 00:11:47.460
Yeah, so for me, when I got to the funeral

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.860
of this young brother, even though I didn't know him personally,

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.620
I had seen that he had just started regular pioneering

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.299
and he had the goal of going to Bethel when he got old enough.

00:11:55.299 --> 00:11:57.740
And I just compared his life to mine.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.139
He was going to give everything he had to Jehovah.

00:12:00.139 --> 00:12:03.179
And I had the circumstances to do the same thing,

00:12:03.179 --> 00:12:04.539
but I wasn't doing it.

00:12:04.539 --> 00:12:07.620
And so I just thought he didn't get to finish his story.

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.620
So I wanted to pick up where he left off.

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:12.220
I wanted to start pioneering.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.659
And so when I went home, I prayed about it

00:12:14.659 --> 00:12:17.100
and I turned in my auxiliary pioneer application

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.460
with the goal of starting regular in September.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.659
Well, that's really encouraging something so tragic

00:12:21.659 --> 00:12:23.940
and yet someone great positive came out of it.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:24.740
What about you, Ben?

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.019
How did you get your start?

00:12:26.019 --> 00:12:28.659
So similar to Whitney, my mother taught me the truth.

00:12:28.659 --> 00:12:31.259
My dad was not in the truth during my youth.

00:12:31.259 --> 00:12:34.700
I grew up in a rural congregation in Michigan.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:39.460
And while I respected the truth in my late teens, early 20s,

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.779
I struggled spiritually.

00:12:41.779 --> 00:12:45.419
And the reason being is because I wanted a lot out of life.

00:12:45.419 --> 00:12:48.860
And at that point, the truth felt very restrictive to me.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.500
It felt like it was holding me back

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.259
and not allowing me to get the rich life that I wanted.

00:12:53.259 --> 00:12:54.659
What changed in your life then?

00:12:54.659 --> 00:12:56.419
What helped you?

00:12:56.419 --> 00:12:57.940
We had a couple pioneer elders

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:00.460
move into our congregation who were a great source

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.899
of encouragement to me.

00:13:01.899 --> 00:13:03.460
They helped me to see that serving Jehovah,

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:05.700
it's not about what you can't do.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.299
It's about all the things you can do.

00:13:08.299 --> 00:13:11.340
And the way I illustrated is with a board game,

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:14.259
if all you did was just learn the rules of that game,

00:13:14.259 --> 00:13:17.700
but you never played it, that wouldn't be a lot of fun.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.299
And that's really how my view was at that time

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:21.019
of the truth.

00:13:21.019 --> 00:13:23.460
I knew the rules, so to speak, of the truth.

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:27.220
I respected the truth, but I wasn't involved in it.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.779
So with the encouragement of these two brothers,

00:13:28.779 --> 00:13:30.620
I really got involved.

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.460
I started playing the game, so to speak.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.259
And I started studying the Bible,

00:13:34.259 --> 00:13:35.899
like I should have all along.

00:13:35.899 --> 00:13:39.259
And then I also started regular pioneering shortly thereafter.

00:13:39.259 --> 00:13:41.820
Nice, well, we're happy you got in the game.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.580
Was there anything else Whitney that helped you

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:47.139
or maybe inspired you to reach out?

00:13:47.139 --> 00:13:49.700
Yeah, when I started wanting to pioneer,

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.419
I also got into more studying.

00:13:52.419 --> 00:13:54.179
And one thing that really affected me

00:13:54.179 --> 00:13:56.379
was the video to the ends of the earth.

00:13:56.379 --> 00:13:59.860
I remember watching it, and as I'm watching it thinking,

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:00.700
that's it.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:01.539
That's what I want to do.

00:14:01.539 --> 00:14:03.860
I want to go to Gilead and I want to be a missionary.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:04.700
Very nice.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.980
Well, that video is still available on jw.org

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.419
on the video library.

00:14:09.419 --> 00:14:12.100
And probably that video, like yourselves,

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.620
inspired hundreds of people to reach out

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:19.419
and enter missionary service to attend Gilead.

00:14:19.419 --> 00:14:21.779
And many of them are still out there

00:14:21.779 --> 00:14:24.299
strengthening and stabilizing the brotherhood.

00:14:24.299 --> 00:14:30.460
So you both then had the goal of foreign service, missionary service.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.460
Did you keep pursuing that goal?

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:33.659
Yeah, we certainly did.

00:14:33.659 --> 00:14:35.700
After we got married six months later,

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.379
we served where the need was great

00:14:37.379 --> 00:14:39.659
in the country of Guyana and South America.

00:14:39.659 --> 00:14:40.740
Nice.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.779
And you brought along a couple of pictures.

00:14:42.779 --> 00:14:44.299
Maybe you can explain these.

00:14:44.299 --> 00:14:46.340
Well, the first one's obviously that's your photo, Ben.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.220
What can you tell us?

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:50.580
Yeah, so we were motivated by the motorbike scene

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.500
in the ends of the Earth video.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.580
So we got a motorbike when we were down there,

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.539
not quite as big or as cool as the one

00:14:57.539 --> 00:14:59.899
in the ends of the Earth video.

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:01.620
But this served its purpose.

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.740
We were able to travel the territory efficiently

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:05.940
through our different Bible studies and return visits.

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:06.779
Good.

00:15:06.779 --> 00:15:10.659
And the next photo, what can you tell us about it, Whitney?

00:15:10.659 --> 00:15:12.980
So when the bike couldn't take us any farther,

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:13.740
we would park it.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.460
And then we walked and a lot of times

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.100
that meant through mud across the trenches.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:18.940
But we didn't mind.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:19.539
It was fun.

00:15:19.539 --> 00:15:20.740
We were enjoying it.

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:22.379
So Ben's being careful on the bridge.

00:15:22.379 --> 00:15:23.940
Yeah, you had to be careful because there

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:26.580
were black Cayman, which is a form of alligator

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:27.700
that were in those trenches.

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.539
So you chose your steps carefully.

00:15:30.539 --> 00:15:32.860
Well, I know Sue, you came back from Guyana.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.620
Did you continue to pursue Gilead?

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:35.139
We did.

00:15:35.139 --> 00:15:36.820
Once we returned to the United States

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:40.179
after serving in Guyana, we applied for Gilead.

00:15:40.179 --> 00:15:42.179
And to our surprise, we were invited

00:15:42.179 --> 00:15:44.740
to serve as special pioneers in the state

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:46.980
of West Virginia here in the United States.

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:49.019
OK, so did Gilead remain your goal, though,

00:15:49.019 --> 00:15:51.059
even though you're there in West Virginia?

00:15:51.059 --> 00:15:51.580
It did.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.980
We continued to apply for Gilead.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:55.659
But then instead, we were invited

00:15:55.659 --> 00:15:57.740
to the Bible school for Christian couples.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:58.340
Very nice.

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.139
So more theocratic education, though.

00:16:01.139 --> 00:16:05.220
And from there, you returned to West Virginia?

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:05.899
That's correct.

00:16:05.899 --> 00:16:09.059
So we continued special pioneering in West Virginia.

00:16:09.059 --> 00:16:11.500
And we also got training for circuit work.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.179
Good.

00:16:12.179 --> 00:16:14.059
Did you end up in the circuit work?

00:16:14.059 --> 00:16:16.980
So we were invited to start circuit work

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.100
in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin area,

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.379
similar close by to the Borenstein.

00:16:21.379 --> 00:16:22.139
And we loved it.

00:16:22.139 --> 00:16:24.259
We loved the friends there, and we love that circuit.

00:16:24.259 --> 00:16:25.299
Nice.

00:16:25.299 --> 00:16:28.139
But of course, change came, didn't it?

00:16:28.139 --> 00:16:29.580
A big change for you?

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:31.659
Yeah, so one day, Ben came home.

00:16:31.659 --> 00:16:32.940
We've been there about four years.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.100
We're loving it.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:36.259
And he came home and told me that we

00:16:36.259 --> 00:16:38.700
got field missionary applications.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.620
There it is, foreign service.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.220
So how did you feel? Ben, how did you feel?

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.620
At that point in our life, we were really

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:46.980
enjoying circuit work.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:49.259
And we loved the friends.

00:16:49.259 --> 00:16:52.820
So admittedly, at that point, the idea of now going foreign

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:56.539
and having another change, maybe lost a bit of its luster.

00:16:56.539 --> 00:16:58.139
And we had gotten so comfortable.

00:16:58.139 --> 00:17:00.340
We had potentially gotten too comfortable.

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:01.820
What about you, Whitney?

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.380
Yeah, I thought, you know, that had always been my goal.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:08.019
But now, Jehovah, now, after I got into circuit work,

00:17:08.019 --> 00:17:10.900
was enjoying it, now you want me to go foreign.

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.180
So what helped you?

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:15.299
So we were explaining what was happening

00:17:15.299 --> 00:17:17.380
and talking to my family, telling them how we feel.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:20.339
I was talking to my sister and my brother-in-law.

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:21.740
And he said, you know what, you feel

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.819
like you got trained for circuit work.

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:25.460
But maybe circuit work was training you

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.099
for the next assignment.

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:29.740
And just shifting my thoughts in that way really helped me.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.539
Yeah, that's great advice.

00:17:31.539 --> 00:17:32.380
What about you, Ben?

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.019
Was there something particularly that helped you?

00:17:34.019 --> 00:17:34.539
There it was.

00:17:34.539 --> 00:17:37.700
I spoke with a brother in the service department at Bethel.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.420
And he said that ones in our situation

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.059
come across his desk frequently.

00:17:42.059 --> 00:17:44.460
And he said, you're at a crossroads.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.900
And there are some who turned down the opportunity

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.339
to accept this form of foreign service.

00:17:49.339 --> 00:17:51.700
He said, but for those that accept it,

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:55.579
who take that step of faith, they receive blessings

00:17:55.579 --> 00:17:59.019
that they could never have imagined from Jehovah.

00:17:59.019 --> 00:18:02.700
And we can rightly say that has been completely accurate.

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:04.460
We feel exactly that way.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:06.180
Well, it shows.

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:07.740
So you went off into a foreign assignment.

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.900
You continued in circuit work there.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:15.019
What would you say Whitney, how did foreign service help you?

00:18:15.019 --> 00:18:17.420
So many ways, but a couple of them

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:20.980
are just getting to express our faith and trust in Jehovah

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.779
in a way that we never would have if we didn't go.

00:18:23.779 --> 00:18:26.539
And one of the greatest gifts was the people that we met,

00:18:26.539 --> 00:18:29.539
the local brothers and sisters, our fellow missionaries

00:18:29.539 --> 00:18:30.900
and circuit overseers.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.940
Their faith in self-sacrifice taught us so much.

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:34.700
Beautiful.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.380
And now you've come to Gilead.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.700
How has Gilead training helped you?

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.980
Again, so many ways, but while we loved our foreign assignment,

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:44.339
it did have challenges.

00:18:44.339 --> 00:18:46.660
And I remember praying to Jehovah, asking him

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:49.140
for help with certain things that I struggled with.

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.180
And the first week that we were here in Gilead,

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.819
I saw the answer to those prayers, specific things

00:18:53.819 --> 00:18:57.019
that I had prayed about answered right in week one.

00:18:57.019 --> 00:18:58.579
And it never stopped since.

00:18:58.579 --> 00:19:00.420
Yeah, and I'm sure Gilead training will just

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:02.500
keep helping you in the future.

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.900
You said at the outset, Ben, that you

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.740
wanted to get a lot out of life.

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:07.019
And I think we would all agree.

00:19:07.019 --> 00:19:10.539
You've gotten a lot out of life, both of you so far.

00:19:10.539 --> 00:19:13.140
And maybe the next 30 minutes, you'll find just out

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.420
just how much more of life you're going to get.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.900
Thank you both for being with us on The Insight Story.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:19.059
Thank you.

00:19:19.059 --> 00:19:20.859
Let's welcome our final guests.

00:19:20.859 --> 00:19:22.740
They're also serving in the United States.

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:37.079
It's Joshua and Saladi Rechenek.

00:19:37.079 --> 00:19:38.240
Joshua and Saladi, welcome.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.440
It's nice to have you.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.559
You're our final guests on The Insight Story for today.

00:19:41.559 --> 00:19:43.440
And I should clarify, although you're

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.160
serving the United States, you are actually

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.559
from Puerto Rico, correct?

00:19:47.559 --> 00:19:50.160
That's right, which is a beautiful tropical island

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.680
in the Caribbean.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:55.440
So my mom and dad moved there before I was born and to serve.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.000
And that's where I was raised.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.680
And they were a tremendous example

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:01.920
for entering full-time service for me.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.319
Because when I was one, they actually

00:20:04.319 --> 00:20:05.640
started in the circuit work.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:09.240
So just from a very young age, it just

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.720
seemed very natural to have that as a goal.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.839
And I'm very grateful.

00:20:12.839 --> 00:20:13.799
OK.

00:20:13.799 --> 00:20:17.640
Saladi, you also born and raised in Puerto Rico?

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.799
That is right.

00:20:18.799 --> 00:20:21.000
I have an older brother, Tafi.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.119
And we both were raised by our mom, Lydia,

00:20:25.119 --> 00:20:26.519
as a single parent.

00:20:26.519 --> 00:20:28.480
She raised us in the truth.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:32.039
And a little bit after Joshua came to our congregation,

00:20:32.039 --> 00:20:34.119
I started to pioneer.

00:20:34.119 --> 00:20:38.160
And also I had the privilege to serve as commuter

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.759
in Puerto Rico, right?

00:20:40.759 --> 00:20:44.759
But we were happy to have him in our congregation,

00:20:44.759 --> 00:20:46.119
but something happened.

00:20:46.119 --> 00:20:46.799
OK.

00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:49.119
Before we get to what happened, we have a nice photograph.

00:20:49.119 --> 00:20:49.640
There it is.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.480
So that's you with your mom, Saladi?

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.160
Yeah, my mom, Lydia.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.000
So Josh, just to clarify this also,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.640
how did you get to Saladi's congregation?

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.400
So after I started pioneering, I

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.160
went to what was called the Ministerial Training School

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.480
in 2003.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:04.839
And after a little bit, I got assigned

00:21:04.839 --> 00:21:07.880
to this lovely rural congregation,

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:10.720
where I just happened to meet a very beautiful sister.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.839
I like the way you say lovely congregation.

00:21:12.839 --> 00:21:13.720
Yes.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.559
But a change came.

00:21:14.559 --> 00:21:16.720
You said, Saladi, something changed.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.559
What changed?

00:21:18.559 --> 00:21:21.039
Well, I had gotten some training as a substitute circuit

00:21:21.039 --> 00:21:22.079
over here.

00:21:22.079 --> 00:21:26.519
And then there was a need for a circuit over here.

00:21:26.519 --> 00:21:27.759
But it wasn't in Puerto Rico.

00:21:27.759 --> 00:21:30.599
It was in a Spanish circuit in Ohio.

00:21:30.599 --> 00:21:32.039
And so I prayed about it.

00:21:32.039 --> 00:21:35.160
And off I went from Puerto Rico to Ohio.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.240
What was that like, Josh?

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:36.920
Tell us about it.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.079
How did you feel when you got there?

00:21:39.079 --> 00:21:41.240
I was very different.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.759
I remember dropping my dad off at the airport

00:21:43.759 --> 00:21:45.599
because he helped me move up.

00:21:45.599 --> 00:21:48.720
And then when I was driving away, I said, I know nobody

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.839
and nothing even nearby after that plane takes off.

00:21:51.839 --> 00:21:54.160
Because not only the place was different,

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.279
but everything was different.

00:21:56.279 --> 00:21:58.240
It's very interesting because the congregations

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:02.119
in the US and Spanish tend to be very mixed culturally.

00:22:02.119 --> 00:22:03.920
And so I got to be with brothers

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.279
from many different cultures that I had

00:22:05.279 --> 00:22:06.880
and experienced before.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.960
I even had to learn to speak Spanish in a way

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.480
that everybody would understand is that it's just

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.720
the brothers from Puerto Rico.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.240
Right.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.920
So that's a huge change for you.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.920
Change of culture coming to the United States.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.359
And then as you say, all these other cultures,

00:22:19.359 --> 00:22:21.319
you brought along a really nice picture, Josh.

00:22:21.319 --> 00:22:23.039
What can you tell us about this?

00:22:23.039 --> 00:22:25.640
I learned this day, a very important skill,

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.559
which is to check the weather report

00:22:27.559 --> 00:22:29.200
before you leave home to preach.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.319
Right.

00:22:30.319 --> 00:22:32.200
Do you not check the weather in Puerto Rico?

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:32.960
Nope.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.920
It's either going to be sunny or it's going to rain.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:35.799
Two choices.

00:22:35.799 --> 00:22:36.599
Interesting.

00:22:36.599 --> 00:22:37.559
What about you, Solidey?

00:22:37.559 --> 00:22:41.759
So Josh has come to the United States.

00:22:41.759 --> 00:22:43.400
How did that affect you?

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.559
Well, I was happy for the assignment.

00:22:45.559 --> 00:22:47.319
It was a privilege.

00:22:47.319 --> 00:22:49.559
So I wanted to support him.

00:22:49.559 --> 00:22:51.440
So we kept in touch.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:54.519
And in 2010, we got married.

00:22:54.519 --> 00:22:57.440
And after that, we received an invitation

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:00.119
to continue as a couple in Ohio.

00:23:00.119 --> 00:23:01.640
Well, that's a big change for you then.

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:05.359
Again, just like Josh, you come new country in a sense,

00:23:06.359 --> 00:23:10.480
new marriage, new assignment in the circuit work.

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.160
What were some of the hard moments for you?

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.240
Maybe Josh, you could share first.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.240
Well, as I said, there was a lot of adaptation.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.119
When you started a new assignment,

00:23:19.119 --> 00:23:22.720
I don't think we ever felt really qualified for it,

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.519
or prepared for it.

00:23:24.519 --> 00:23:27.200
And so we were very young when we started the circuit work,

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.400
visiting congregations where sometimes there were brothers

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.200
that had been serving as regular pioneers longer

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.680
than we'd been alive.

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.519
And then all of a sudden,

00:23:34.519 --> 00:23:38.000
we've had the responsibility to encourage them and help them.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.720
So that could be a bit intimidating.

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.519
Sure.

00:23:41.519 --> 00:23:43.240
And you brought along another photo

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:46.079
that you can see the confusion of the adaptation.

00:23:46.079 --> 00:23:47.960
What can you tell us about this, Josh?

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:51.160
So this was Field Service Day.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.000
We shortly after getting married.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.680
It wasn't that I was distracted or anything,

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:58.000
but we rushed out the door, went to Field Service,

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.039
took the group out, made all the arrangements.

00:24:00.039 --> 00:24:02.440
And then a dear brother, very good friendy,

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:05.559
came up to me and he put his arm around my shoulder.

00:24:05.559 --> 00:24:07.240
And he took me over to Solidey.

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.400
And he says, I'm not going to say anything.

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.440
I'm just going to look.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.319
And he looked down at my shoes.

00:24:12.319 --> 00:24:16.720
And well, it just turned out that I put two different shoes on.

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.279
And he was kind enough to point that out

00:24:18.279 --> 00:24:19.279
before I went out and served us.

00:24:19.279 --> 00:24:21.960
But he didn't point it out before he took the picture.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.240
Of course.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.599
Solidey, what were you thinking?

00:24:24.599 --> 00:24:27.160
I was like, baby, but what happened?

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.799
What are you doing?

00:24:29.799 --> 00:24:31.839
So you always check his shoes before he goes out now.

00:24:31.839 --> 00:24:35.400
I learned to check him before leaving home.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.359
But maybe in all seriousness, Josh, what would you say?

00:24:38.359 --> 00:24:41.920
What were the keys to helping you?

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:44.400
I got some really good advice from brothers

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.759
with more experience, including my father.

00:24:46.759 --> 00:24:50.079
And there's really two keys we found.

00:24:50.079 --> 00:24:52.319
One is to love the brothers.

00:24:52.319 --> 00:24:54.160
Because that's really what they need.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.519
They need love and affection in your time.

00:24:57.519 --> 00:24:59.880
And the other is to be humble.

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.759
Because the brothers appreciate greatly

00:25:01.759 --> 00:25:03.680
the arrangement of the circuit over here.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.559
Whoever the circuit over here is.

00:25:05.559 --> 00:25:07.720
So as long as you remain humble, Jehovah

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.160
can use you to encourage the friends.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:11.640
And then all glory goes to you.

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.119
Very nice to love humility.

00:25:14.119 --> 00:25:17.160
And that's really what helps us become all things to all people.

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.519
What about for you, Solidey?

00:25:18.519 --> 00:25:21.480
What were challenges for you?

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:24.920
Well, for me, it was the emotional part.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:25.960
Because it is true.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.640
It is a beautiful privilege

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.880
to be able to know so many brothers and sisters

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.960
and make bonds with them.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.640
But at the same time, you face reality.

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:39.480
You see all the struggle that they are going through.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:42.839
So some are dealing with health problems

00:25:42.839 --> 00:25:46.720
or economic problems or even their status in the country.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:50.440
So I was not able to help them in the way that I wanted.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.039
So I felt helpless.

00:25:52.039 --> 00:25:54.720
So what could you do for them?

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:59.640
So I had to left that part in the Jehovah hands

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.359
and give them my time.

00:26:02.359 --> 00:26:05.440
So I tried to go with them on service,

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:08.119
try to encourage them.

00:26:08.119 --> 00:26:11.039
Sometimes we laugh, sometimes we cry.

00:26:11.039 --> 00:26:13.400
But I tried to show them our love

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.759
and even more important that Jehovah loved them.

00:26:15.759 --> 00:26:16.440
Nice.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.759
Well, I'm sure you left a little bit of your heart

00:26:18.759 --> 00:26:19.920
with all of them.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.880
That's very nice.

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.240
Now you're here in Gilead.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:24.599
Was that a surprise for you?

00:26:24.599 --> 00:26:27.039
Yes, a big surprise.

00:26:27.039 --> 00:26:28.559
And Josh, I know Gilead actually

00:26:28.559 --> 00:26:30.160
has a special place in your heart.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.440
Why is that?

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:31.960
It does.

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.880
It's because my parents attended Gilead.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.519
And that's actually what brought them to Puerto Rico.

00:26:37.519 --> 00:26:39.880
They attended the 52nd class.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.200
Right, good.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.680
So having parents who went to Gilead,

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.039
did they keep Gilead in their heart

00:26:45.039 --> 00:26:47.599
even after they had a family and were raising Union?

00:26:47.599 --> 00:26:49.039
They did, absolutely.

00:26:49.039 --> 00:26:53.880
I remember they had their graduation photo up in the hallway

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.440
where all of us would walk by every day.

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.839
So every day of my life growing up,

00:26:57.839 --> 00:26:59.240
I walk past that photo.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.880
There it is, 52nd class.

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.000
That's them.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.400
And also the way they were,

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.839
the way they served Jehovah,

00:27:06.839 --> 00:27:09.440
the love and zeal that they have,

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.599
it's clear to me, even clearer now,

00:27:12.599 --> 00:27:15.279
that Gilead had a big impact on them.

00:27:15.279 --> 00:27:16.799
What would you say that impact was on them?

00:27:16.799 --> 00:27:20.240
How did you see Gilead training in them?

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.559
I think two things.

00:27:21.559 --> 00:27:24.440
One is that there are excellent students of the Bible

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:25.839
always have been.

00:27:25.839 --> 00:27:27.319
My mom's Bible has so many notes.

00:27:27.319 --> 00:27:29.079
I don't think he can hold anymore.

00:27:29.079 --> 00:27:33.200
And my dad, I remember he would be reading the Bible

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.920
with us at night and he had an envelope

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.799
that he'd marked the family Bible with.

00:27:37.799 --> 00:27:39.200
And all of a sudden he'd stop reading

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.039
and stop to make a note on the envelope

00:27:41.039 --> 00:27:42.720
because he came across a scripture

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.440
that he wanted to use for a talk or a shepherding chord,

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.079
just a point that he liked.

00:27:47.079 --> 00:27:49.200
So that was an excellent example.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.599
And also they've always worked very, very hard

00:27:51.599 --> 00:27:52.880
for Kingdom interests.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.039
They've always had the goal to do as much as they can

00:27:55.039 --> 00:27:56.759
for as long as they can

00:27:56.759 --> 00:27:59.519
and just kind of became the family model.

00:27:59.519 --> 00:28:02.200
So it's interesting now going through Gilead

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.400
and seeing so much emphasis placed on those,

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.319
exactly those things to feed your love for Jehovah

00:28:07.319 --> 00:28:09.839
and do as much as you can for the organization.

00:28:09.839 --> 00:28:12.359
Yeah, I was going to ask you that as well.

00:28:12.359 --> 00:28:13.799
Here you are sitting in class

00:28:13.799 --> 00:28:16.960
and you're hearing to a great degree,

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.839
the same things your parents heard.

00:28:18.839 --> 00:28:20.440
Has that helped to at all?

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.440
It has.

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:24.079
They must have had those qualities to an extent

00:28:24.079 --> 00:28:25.559
when they came to Gilead.

00:28:25.559 --> 00:28:27.839
But I think listening to the classes now

00:28:27.839 --> 00:28:31.759
it's clear that Gilead stirred that up in them

00:28:31.759 --> 00:28:34.119
and kept that flame burning for many, many years.

00:28:34.119 --> 00:28:35.279
That's beautiful.

00:28:35.279 --> 00:28:37.400
And they must be very proud of both of you

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:40.839
as you apply yourselves and will apply the training

00:28:40.839 --> 00:28:43.759
and look forward to applying in your future assignments.

00:28:43.759 --> 00:28:46.079
Thank you both very much for being with us today.

00:28:46.079 --> 00:28:47.599
Thank you.

00:28:47.599 --> 00:28:50.440
In the introduction, we quoted Paul's words

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.960
in 1 Corinthians 9 verse 22.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:57.039
He said, I've become all things to people of all sorts

00:28:57.039 --> 00:29:01.079
so that I might by all possible means save some.

00:29:01.079 --> 00:29:04.960
The apostle obligated himself to adjust his life

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:08.160
and personal tastes for the sake of the good news.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.440
We hope today's program has been encouraging to you.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:15.720
Whether it's trying something you just don't prefer

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:19.519
or something you didn't think you could do in Jehovah's service,

00:29:19.519 --> 00:29:22.640
maybe it's just getting in the game, so to speak,

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.200
or giving someone a little piece of your heart

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.920
to encourage them.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:31.720
Today's guests have shown us that by adjusting your life

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.799
and personal tastes for the sake of the good news

00:29:34.799 --> 00:29:38.519
with Jehovah, we can cope with any change

00:29:38.519 --> 00:29:42.359
or make any change for Jehovah's service.

00:29:42.359 --> 00:29:43.680
Thank you for being with us

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:46.119
and we look forward to seeing you on another edition

00:29:46.119 --> 00:29:47.440
of the Inside Story.
