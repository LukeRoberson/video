00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:10.740
the cities of refuge. That was a merciful provision of God, but we might link it to something

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:20.140
that could involve all of us, and that is the common expression, forgive and forget. I'm

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:27.820
sure you've heard it, and maybe you have tried to apply it. But maybe at the outset ask

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:35.899
yourself, were the cities of refuge a provision to forgive and forget? Well, if you were there

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:44.060
and some man chopping a tree, the axe head fell, flew off and bumped your uncle, killing him,

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:50.619
you think you'd be in position to say, oh, well, it was an accident. You didn't mean it. You feel

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:59.100
sorry. So why don't we just forgive and forget? No, that wasn't possible because the sanctity of

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:08.379
life and blood were involved in that case. But do they suggest the cities of refuge that God,

00:01:08.379 --> 00:01:18.299
though merciful, does not forgive or forget? Well, if you open to the fourth chapter of Ephesians,

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:27.260
there is a verse there that makes it clear what the answer is. That is Ephesians 4 verse 32,

00:01:29.019 --> 00:01:36.459
but become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate, freely forgiving one another,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:46.459
just as God also by Christ freely forgave you. So certainly, we wouldn't disagree that God

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:56.140
is able to forgive. As to forgetting, in Jeremiah 31, a comment with regard to the new covenant,

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:08.379
said, I will forgive their error, and I will no longer remember their sin. So does God forgive and

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:20.699
forget? Think of the account of David. We know of his grievous sin, and still afterward, God said

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:28.460
to Solomon with regard to David, that David walked with integrity of heart with uprightness by

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:39.580
doing according to all that I commanded. So clearly, God had forgiven David, but how about forgetting?

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:48.780
Did God forget David's sins? We know about them because as they're recorded in the Bible, we don't

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.259
forget them, and certainly God's recording them. The Bible shows he doesn't forget them in the

00:02:55.259 --> 00:03:03.819
strictest sense of the word. But with regard to David's serious sins, God was able to forget in

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:13.659
the sense of putting behind him David's sins and not remembering them in the sense of calling them

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:22.620
back to punish David time and time again. He, that is God, put David's sins behind him.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:32.460
Well, what about us and the encouragement to forgive and forget? We know that there are times,

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:39.659
as mentioned earlier today, when individuals may rub us the wrong way, say something hurtful about

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:48.379
us, maybe it's like a stab of a sword, they may do something thoughtless, they may even betray

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:56.780
a confidence and hurt us in that way. So what's our reaction going to be? Get angry, say something

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:07.819
harsh and return, maybe simply avoid the brother or sister thereafter. Well, we mentioned Ephesians 432

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:18.220
Reddit and it said, freely forgiving one another, just as God, also by Christ freely forgave you.

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:27.740
So clearly, if we want to imitate God, then that involves being willing to forgive.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:36.620
And that means putting the individuals trespasses behind us.

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:46.459
Realistically, how can we go about that? We might think of some physical wounds to illustrate the

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:55.420
point. Some wounds are small and light others more serious or deeper and they don't all require

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:03.819
the same reaction. But let's just imagine that we had an envelope and we used our finger to open

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:12.220
the envelope and then the process got a paper cut. Wow, that hurt. We wished we had used the

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:20.379
letter opener. We did. We used our finger and it really hurt. But isn't it true that if you've

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:28.540
done that a day or two later, you can't even remember where the wound is. I mean, you cut yourself,

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:37.819
but you've forgotten it. Some wounds, of course, are more serious or deeper. Let's just say you

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:46.139
needed an emergency appendectomy and it wasn't going to be done laparoscoptically with three small

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:56.779
holes, but rather with an open incision. Now, after that, would it be rational to stick your finger

00:05:56.779 --> 00:06:05.660
through the incision and kind of poke around inside where the appendix had been? Would poking around

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:13.899
in the wound help things? Or rather, to let it go, forget about it. It might be hurtful to walk for

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:21.500
a few days, but in time, it's behind you. And in fact, now, if you've had an appendectomy,

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.899
you probably don't think about it. And maybe years since you thought about it,

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:32.699
oh, granted there may be a small scar on your abdomen, but it is put behind you.

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:42.699
Can that same concept be applied to unkind things that have been said about us, someone who

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:53.819
perhaps betrayed a trust? Now, what? Colossians chapter three, we might read the whole verse,

00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:04.860
verse 13, continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely, even if anyone

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:15.500
has a cause for complaint against another, just as Jehovah freely forgave you, you must also

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:26.060
do the same. Now, we want to imitate Jehovah, do we not? And if God freely forgives, is that not

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:34.220
an incentive for us to try to do the same? Now, granted, that doesn't mean that Jehovah has

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:44.220
forgotten the trespass against us. Can we? Maybe, maybe not. We do recall what Jesus said in the

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:52.939
model prayer, however, when he said that as we forgive the trespasses of others, so God will

00:07:52.939 --> 00:08:01.660
accordingly forgive our trespasses. Conversely, if we are disinclined to forgive the trespasses of

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:13.500
others, what can we expect of God for us? So then what is the essence applied personally of this

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:24.620
encouragement to forgive and forget? It means to forgive in the sense of letting go, not holding

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:34.220
on to the anger, not a feeling constant resentment thereafter, or not even gossiping about what was

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:42.539
done that that hurt us. Maybe it really is quite immaterial. Maybe it's simply like a paper cut

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:49.340
that in a couple of days, we don't even remember where the wound is. Can we do that with regard to

00:08:49.419 --> 00:08:58.460
the offense or the hurt personally? But even with something more serious, an offense that seems deeper,

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:08.539
can we be like Jehovah, forgetting in the sense of putting it behind us, just as Jehovah

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:19.100
didn't thereafter, punish David time and time again. Can we put the fellow servants, air, offense,

00:09:20.539 --> 00:09:29.820
perhaps a lack of trust? Can we put those things behind? It's realizing he or she is still our

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:38.139
brother. And it's an imperfect brother, just as weary and perfect. But put it behind and forgive

00:09:38.139 --> 00:09:45.740
the trespass just as Jehovah forgives our trespasses.
