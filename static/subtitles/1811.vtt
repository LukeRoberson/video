00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:07.190
But, what if we face a situation in which we have access to nothing?

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:14.050
We are not allowed to have a Bible, no literature with illustrations, no videos, and no audio

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.970
recordings.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.210
What do we do?

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.250
Our recollection of what we have read in the past can keep our spirituality intact.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.210
One of our brothers from Russia faced such a situation.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:40.060
The year was 1963.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.659
I was 36 at the time.

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:52.659
The KGB searched my home and found some Bible literature and some publishers' field service reports.

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:58.659
So I was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for being an organizer.

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:03.659
That was the third time I had been imprisoned.

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:08.659
Some brothers and sisters and I went to the court to support brother Vladimir.

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:19.079
When he saw us, he clasped his hands and declared everything is fine.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:27.079
A KGB officer told me that the only reason I hadn't been imprisoned was because I had six children, but Vladimir was single.

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:32.079
I was just glad that they had arrested me and not him because I didn't have a family.

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:41.980
In the camp I didn't have a Bible or any Bible literature at all.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.980
All I had to keep me going was the knowledge I already had.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:53.980
We prayed for him and we sent greetings and encouraging messages to him through his relatives.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:00.980
Due to the strict censorship in the camp, we were not allowed to write anything spiritual in our letters to encourage each other.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.980
If we did, the letters were confiscated.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.979
But I really wanted to send brother Mikhail something encouraging.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:23.340
I was growing flowers with a group of inmates in the camp, so instead of sending him a letter, I decided to send him a bouquet of flowers.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:36.430
Vladimir's sister Olga came to our home and she brought me a beautiful bouquet of flowers from Vladimir.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:45.430
I couldn't believe that I had received fresh flowers from behind a barbed wire fence from inside the camp.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:54.430
I was so touched by his act of kindness that my heart moved me to write down some verses, a poem which I called the bouquet.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:02.770
My relatives came and visited me in the prison and delivered to me the poem.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.770
I kept the poem in a very secret place.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:12.770
It could have been confiscated and I could have been punished because it was about God.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:19.770
After Vladimir was released from prison, well, he told me that my poem had really strengthened him.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.770
That he had often taken it out of its secret hiding place to read it over and over again.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:35.849
If it hadn't been for the support I received from Jehovah and the prayers of friends, it would have been much harder for me to serve my time.

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:47.699
The poem that I had received helped me not to feel separated from my friends and most importantly, not from Jehovah.

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:56.699
So many years have now gone by, but we have remained firm through the difficult times and we continue serving Jehovah.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:07.460
Lately Vladimir and I have been trying to keep in touch by phone, but we haven't seen each other for seven years.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.460
I would really love to see Vladimir again.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.459
He doesn't know that I've decided to go and visit him.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.459
I hope that he likes the surprise.

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:58.230
I see these flowers grown by hands, pardon from work, but prison demands.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.230
My friend has sent a bouquet.

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:07.230
Prison three times prevented our meeting, but you found a way to convey a greeting.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:13.230
My joy now moves me to say, greetings my brother with all of my heart.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.230
You gave me strength, although we're apart.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:23.230
While you have countless trials withstood, you've strengthened me as best you could.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.230
Greetings, my friend, on that narrow road.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.230
You were always with me through hardships untold.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:37.230
We worked so hard for spiritual treasure, blessed we were for sticking together.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:46.230
You were taken from me when they tried to break our integrity, but God stood by us and helped us to cope.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:51.230
Conquer the evil we did for our dear kingdom hope.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:58.230
How grateful we are and always will be for spiritual vision by which we can see.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:05.230
The crown of life promised to those who stay on the loyal course they chose.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:11.230
I'll much you've endured long suffering friend, but Jehovah's mercy will never end.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:18.230
On a paradise earth our hands will unite, planting more flowers to gladden his sight.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:25.230
Christ Jesus will heal us during his reign, so no trace of sin will ever remain.

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:37.290
And far from the trials that we overcame, forever will praise Jehovah's great name.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:49.220
True friends are such a blessing from Jehovah, and you don't really know who they are until disaster strikes.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:07:00.220
During my whole life, walking in the way of the truth, I have often thought about the words of Psalm 119 verse 63, where it says,

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:06.220
I am a friend of all who fear you and of those who keep your orders.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:14.589
Our serving side by side in the kingdom work is strengthened our friendship.

00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:17.589
It's only that sort of friendship that will last forever.

00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:27.699
What a beautiful friendship.

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:31.699
Our brotherhood truly is a blessing from Jehovah.

00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:44.699
Brother Mikhail Savitsky spent many years as a circuit overseer, helping the kingdom work progress in Siberia, Northern Caucasus, and the countries of Georgia and Armenia.

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:54.699
In 1992, he had the privilege of being one of those who signed the documents that confirmed legal recognition of our work in Russia.

00:07:54.699 --> 00:08:04.699
However, we regret to inform you that sometime after this segment was produced, brother Vladimir Vakolik fell asleep in death.

00:08:04.699 --> 00:08:10.699
He was 88 years old and had served Jehovah faithfully for over 59 years.

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:20.699
At the time of his death, he had served as a pioneer for some 26 years, and as an elder in the congregation for 43 years.

00:08:20.699 --> 00:08:29.699
From his interview, you can clearly see the faith that kept his spirituality strong through 12 years of imprisonment.

00:08:29.699 --> 00:08:32.700
And he has a good example for us.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:37.700
Did you notice one aspect of his circumstances while incarcerated?

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:45.700
He said, in the camp, I didn't have a Bible or any Bible literature at all.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:50.700
All I had to keep me going was the knowledge I already had.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.700
That could happen to us.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.700
When persecution starts, we need to be prepared.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:03.700
That's one reason why it is so important not to neglect our study of the Bible while we have the opportunity.
