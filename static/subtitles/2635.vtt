00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.720
I was the first to start studying the Bible.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.720
After that, I started studying too.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.719
After watching them for a year, I began studying too.

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:22.719
Since our parents had stopped studying,

00:00:22.719 --> 00:00:25.719
only three of us went to the meetings.

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:29.719
We saved our allowance to take the bus to meetings,

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:32.719
but sometimes, when we were short of money,

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.719
my sisters let me ride the bus since I'm the youngest,

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.719
and they would walk.

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:43.719
We used to walk an hour and a half each way.

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.719
Meetings were so important to us that we never felt it was a burden.

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.719
May 2007. For me, it was October 2006.

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.719
I was baptized in October 2005.

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.719
Three years later, I spent a week with a special pioneer

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.719
who were serving in the countryside.

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:08.719
We prayed together every night,

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:12.719
and read life stories from the watchtower.

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:17.719
I told Jehovah, I wanted to be just like her.

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:21.719
Although my relatives were unhappy with my decision,

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:25.719
with Jehovah's help, I decided to become a pioneer.

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:29.719
I followed her example and I became a pioneer too.

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:33.719
I was working six days a week to support my family,

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:37.719
so I prayed to Jehovah for the opportunity to become a pioneer.

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:41.719
After my boss reduced my work to five days a week,

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:45.450
I started pioneering.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.450
Pioneer service gives you the opportunity to serve to have a more fully.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.450
Working closely with Jehovah, I really feel part of his family.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.450
My relationship with Jehovah has gotten stronger.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.450
When I pray now, it feels like I'm talking to my close friend.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.450
It allows you to expand your ministry.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.449
I became a special pioneer in June 2013.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:15.449
I've served up Bethel since September 2013.

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:20.449
In April 2014, I was appointed a special pioneer.

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:24.449
Now I can serve Jehovah more fully.

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:27.449
My appreciation for Jehovah has deepened.

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:32.449
Our mother who deposed us became a pioneer too.

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:36.449
Food time services really awesome.
