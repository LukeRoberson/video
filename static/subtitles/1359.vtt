00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:14.130
The city of Milan in Northern Italy recently hosted an important international event, Expo

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:22.570
Milan or 2015. It was an exposition that lasted for six months, with 145 participant nations

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.370
and 20 million visitors arriving from every corner of the earth.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.170
What did your hovers' witnesses do in order to spread the good news to such a vast number

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:40.899
of people? Mobile witnessing carts were set up at strategic points around the main entrance

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:48.700
of the Expo. 450 witness volunteers were instructed on how to spread the message to the thousands

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:56.179
of passes by. The theme of this Expo was feeding the planet energy for life and in line with

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:02.979
these arrangements were made to reprint a series of articles that appeared in a 2012 issue

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:11.060
of awake magazine. The series was entitled, Is Your Food Really Safe? Of course, most of the visitors

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.819
would find accommodation in the city. Therefore, congregations in and around Milan made an effort to

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:22.180
contact all the hotels in the area to offer the staff and their guests an opportunity to read

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.260
this special edition of awake on food and nutrition. At first, some brothers were nervous they

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.260
wouldn't be received well, but the reaction of most of the hotel administrators was very encouraging.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:40.900
Almost everyone was happy to accept a copy of the magazine. Thanks to your cooperation,

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.379
each month the magazines were brought to us. It has sparked interest because people, clients,

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:53.540
the guests can find an interesting magazine to look at in their own language and they nearly always

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:03.180
run out of the magazines by the end of the week. Was it worth the effort? Well, in a period of just

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:12.060
six months, over 360,000 magazines were placed. 244,000 of which were the special issue dedicated

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:29.599
to food and to date, 892 people have asked to be re-contacted. In the past few years, the community

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:35.439
of Jehovah's Witnesses has become much more visible in the city of Milan. It's not unusual to see

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:41.520
them with their carts, even in the more central areas of the city and I must say they're always smiling,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:48.560
polite and well dressed. They have adopted a new method. Now it's the passes by who decide whether

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.719
to stop and take one of the items on display or have a brief conversation. The Milanese people

00:02:54.719 --> 00:03:01.360
really like this method. The topics presented are always very timely. The display about food really

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.479
stands out. It brings to mind the general theme of export, feed the planet. I must say, it's a great

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:14.719
initiative. I was able to speak to a couple visiting from China and I gave them a copy of the

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:19.599
special issue of awake. After having explained to them that we are volunteers, to my great surprise

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:24.319
they invited me to have lunch with them. We had a really nice conversation for around three hours

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.039
during which they asked me a lot of questions. I left them the book, what does the Bible really teach

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:33.120
and it was lovely to see how they agreed that the Bible really can improve people's lives.

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:40.400
A tourist margin Tina already reads our magazines regularly in her country. When she saw our

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.560
cart she immediately recognised our magazines and though she took a copy of the special June 2012

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:54.960
issue she exclaimed, I like your magazines because they make a person a good person. A school teacher

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.000
accompanied by her students noticed her special issue of the awake magazine and told her students

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.520
that each take a copy because later on they would consider it in a class discussion. Other school

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.800
teachers present did the same so that in just a few minutes we distributed 70 magazines.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.839
Especially equipped bicycle was used to ride back and forth between the storeroom and the carts.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:41.490
As a result the magazines were available seven days a week, 12 hours a day. How encouraging it is

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:58.930
to make the most of every opportunity to praise Jehovah. There really is no better way to use our time.
