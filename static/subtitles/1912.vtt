00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.640
Hello there.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.599
It's a pleasure to welcome you to our program.

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:12.800
We have a few updates to share, and then we'll watch an encouraging interview.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:20.600
We're excited that two brothers were recently released from prison in Russia after completing

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.679
their sentences.

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:31.160
On July 19, 2023, 69-year-old brother Yerey Savalia was released.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.600
He spent over four and a half years behind bars, dozens of brothers and sisters welcomed

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.640
him outside the prison.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.640
We're very happy for him and his loved ones.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:53.439
And on July 26, 2023, brother Sergei Klima was released after some five years in prison.

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:57.960
He was warmly welcomed by his family and friends.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.840
We rejoice with you all.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:10.079
When Jesus said at Revelation 210, the devil will keep on throwing some of you into prison.

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:15.640
But Jesus also said, do not be afraid.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:23.439
The watch star of July 2019 stated, when our enemies ban our worship, they hope to make

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.280
us afraid to serve Jehovah.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.159
In addition to the ban, they may circulate false stories, send officials to search our

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.920
homes, drag us to court, or even in prison, some of us.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.120
They hope that we will be terrified because they managed to put a small number of us in

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.120
prison.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:53.319
Yet, what do we learn from these two dear brothers in Russia?

00:01:53.319 --> 00:02:00.680
They have successfully endured their imprisonment and have come out victorious.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:09.419
Truly Jesus was right when he said, we have no reason to be afraid.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:17.819
Our brothers and sisters around the world are enjoying the exercise patience convention.

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.139
For our young ones, this may be the first convention they'll remember attending in

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:24.139
person.

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:26.139
Let's hear from a few of them.

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:42.169
We picked a hill, my mother convention, and I can see everybody again.

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:46.650
I like being here at the convention because I get to meet the brothers and sisters

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.650
who are here.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.530
I like taking pictures with my new friends.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:03:00.180
I'm out here to be in the convention today because I could hug my brothers and sisters,

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.979
and I also like the songs they relax me a lot.

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:08.819
I have to clean with the friends in our congregation.

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:09.819
It was fun.

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:16.139
My family and friends are all here surrounded me, loving to hope I just like I do.

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:22.020
To me, I like to be here because I can see the videos and also see all of the brothers.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.259
I definitely think being in person is much better.

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:29.500
I learned lots of more things I didn't really focus on when I was at home.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:49.639
I like coming to the convention because I'm watching it on the TV.

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:52.120
What beautiful comments.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.759
We're so proud of all you parents.

00:03:55.759 --> 00:04:03.000
The effort you make to bring your little ones to the convention reminds us of what Joseph

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.639
and Mary did.

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:12.879
After after here, they brought Jesus and his siblings to the festival in Jerusalem.

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:20.240
And it was worth the effort, likewise you parents are giving a beautiful gift to your children

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.439
by bringing them to the convention.

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:31.810
It must warm Jehovah's heart to see you all in attendance.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.569
On September 1, a new service year begins.

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:47.449
And so does our worldwide campaign to feature the Watch Tsar No. 2 2020 entitled, What Is

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.290
God's Kingdom?

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:58.370
Publishers who served as auxiliary pioneers can choose a 15 or 30 hour requirement.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.410
We need the kingdom more than ever before.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:10.149
And it's a joy for us to share this vital message with our neighbors.

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:18.350
Many congregations will soon be informed of the dates for the 2024 Regional Conventions.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:26.949
We're pleased to inform you that the theme of the 2024 Convention Program is, Declare

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:29.110
the Good News.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:38.470
It's based on 1 Corinthians 9-16, which says, Now, if I am declaring the Good News, it's

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.829
no reason for me to boast.

00:05:41.829 --> 00:05:52.069
For necessity is laid upon me, really, woe to me if I do not declare the Good News.

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:59.069
With so much bad news today, we know you enjoy all three days of this thrilling convention.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:04.310
From the very first word on Friday.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:11.910
Speaking of Good News, we rejoiced when 28 of our dear brothers and sisters were released

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:18.149
from prison in Eritrea on December 4, 2020.

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:24.709
They had been in prison for between five and 26 years.

00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:29.029
Why were they imprisoned for their Christian neutrality?

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:39.709
Brother Negetti, Teclamarium, was among those targeted for taking a neutral stand.

00:06:39.709 --> 00:06:49.230
In 1994, when Negetti was only 21 years old, soldiers abducted him from his home.

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:58.990
He's been a total of 26 years in two prisons along with brothers Paulus Iaso and Isat Mogeth.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:07.230
Since their release from prison in 2020, Isat was baptized, and the three brothers continued

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:11.470
to serve Jehovah faithfully.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:17.629
As you watch the following Heart Warming interview, let's notice what helped Negetti

00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:20.949
to keep his integrity.

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:27.550
On September 17, 1994, at about 1 a.m., three soldiers came and knocked on our gates.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:33.069
They did not give me an opportunity to speak or change my clothes.

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:37.829
My mother said to me, take courage to Jehovah's with you.

00:07:37.829 --> 00:07:42.550
As long as you remain loyal to him, Jehovah will safeguard you.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:49.439
My mother kept repeating those words as I was taken away.

00:07:49.439 --> 00:07:51.959
Sawa is a military training camp.

00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:56.040
It's a huge camp, and within the camp there is a little prison compound.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.439
It's only for a lack of words that we call it a prison.

00:07:59.519 --> 00:08:01.199
There's no words for it.

00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:04.759
It's not a humane way to treat another human being.

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:10.720
The room, which is made of corrugated metal sheets, during the day it gets extremely hot.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.959
There was no ventilation in the room, no bed.

00:08:13.959 --> 00:08:16.000
We slept on the ground.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.160
Food provided by the government was meager, bread, dry lentils, sometimes soup.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.600
In prison, we were tied with ropes and endured cruel treatment by the guards.

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:29.480
Extreme physical beatings and forced labor.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.600
They made us work extra hard in order to tire us out.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.200
So we would give up and do what they wanted us to do.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.519
What I found the most challenging in the 23 years at Sawa

00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:44.120
was that even to relieve yourself of your natural body functions,

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.519
you were not able to do it when you needed to.

00:08:46.519 --> 00:08:48.960
We had to get permission to relieve ourselves.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.679
And there was always a soldier guarding and watching us.

00:08:51.679 --> 00:08:53.600
That is the worst kind of life.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.720
We never had a bathroom.

00:08:55.759 --> 00:08:58.559
There was never a hope of one day being released,

00:08:58.559 --> 00:09:02.519
let alone even going to face a court that was sentenced to us.

00:09:02.519 --> 00:09:05.320
They were just waiting for us to go insane,

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.960
or to die due to lack of medical treatment.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:14.399
Something that helped me keep going was a scripture that was the daily text of the day I was arrested.

00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:17.399
The scripture was John 1633.

00:09:17.399 --> 00:09:19.519
That scripture in part mentions,

00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:25.120
in the world you will have tribulation, but take courage.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.360
The scripture was a source of encouragement and comfort not only to us prisoners,

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.980
but also to all the brothers who were left behind.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:37.779
The soldiers took me to the wilderness and told me to dig a hole.

00:09:37.779 --> 00:09:40.299
They said before us two choices.

00:09:40.299 --> 00:09:45.299
They said, we have tried many things on you, but you didn't change.

00:09:45.299 --> 00:09:47.940
The government has decided to execute you.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:52.179
Put on the military uniform and be soldiers like others.

00:09:52.179 --> 00:09:55.500
Or if you continue saying, I belong to God's kingdom

00:09:55.539 --> 00:09:59.700
or I belong to the heaven kingdom, you will be put in this hole.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.620
They put me in the hole.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.019
The hole was deep enough for only my neck to be above ground.

00:10:05.019 --> 00:10:08.299
Not only was the strong daytime sun beating on my head,

00:10:08.299 --> 00:10:12.740
I'm buried in sand that the sun has been beating on all day.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:16.940
I was sweating and slowly starting to pass out.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:20.620
There was a car with military personnel traveling from a distance.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:24.419
They could see a body buried with only his neck above the ground.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.019
This soldier was not from the military camp.

00:10:27.019 --> 00:10:29.340
He was simply passing by.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.539
He was a high-ranking military official.

00:10:33.139 --> 00:10:34.940
I didn't know him personally.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.460
He didn't know me.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:40.179
He asked the men, how did this even happen?

00:10:40.179 --> 00:10:44.139
Is that even allowed to do this to a human being?

00:10:44.139 --> 00:10:46.659
Who gave you the order to bury him alive?

00:10:46.659 --> 00:10:49.059
One thing I, and even those who were with me,

00:10:49.059 --> 00:10:52.220
learned from this is, when a person goes into prison,

00:10:52.259 --> 00:10:54.539
he may feel like he is alone.

00:10:54.539 --> 00:10:57.700
But as long as we stay faithful to Jehovah,

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.620
we trust him to do something.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.580
I have seen the scripture in Romans chapter eight

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.899
from 35 on being fulfilled in our case.

00:11:06.899 --> 00:11:08.940
Jehovah helped us.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:25.409
Truly nothing can separate us from his love.

00:11:25.409 --> 00:11:29.090
There was a lady in a gentleman who were working in the prison.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.929
The male was a guard and she was a secretary.

00:11:31.929 --> 00:11:33.929
They talked among themselves.

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:35.850
They reason, it looks like the government

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:37.610
is going to kill them.

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:39.250
Why don't we record what we see

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:41.129
and take their story outside?

00:11:41.129 --> 00:11:43.289
At least we can say to their families,

00:11:43.289 --> 00:11:46.129
they were here and this is what they look like.

00:11:46.129 --> 00:11:48.289
So they decided to take a picture

00:11:48.289 --> 00:11:51.330
and show it to our families into the rest of the world.

00:11:52.529 --> 00:11:54.649
You can see on the picture of Paulos,

00:11:54.649 --> 00:11:56.889
his hands are full of mud.

00:11:56.889 --> 00:11:59.809
At the time, we were doing manual labor outside,

00:11:59.809 --> 00:12:01.809
moving rocks and things.

00:12:01.809 --> 00:12:03.570
We didn't want our family members

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:05.570
or our parents who saw the picture

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:08.009
to see a sad and dejected,

00:12:08.009 --> 00:12:10.409
but rather we wanted them to know

00:12:10.409 --> 00:12:13.490
we're happy to be persecuted for the Christ.

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:20.679
That's why we made an effort to smile.

00:12:20.679 --> 00:12:22.360
Throughout our time in prison,

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.799
prayer was a tool that really helped us through.

00:12:25.799 --> 00:12:27.799
Especially in the first few years,

00:12:27.799 --> 00:12:31.200
we had no access to spiritual food, no Bible,

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.519
no publications.

00:12:32.519 --> 00:12:34.799
The only thing we had was prayer.

00:12:35.799 --> 00:12:38.480
One specific thing I remember praying early on

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.159
is for Jehovah to let us be free from prison.

00:12:42.159 --> 00:12:44.120
But as the years went by,

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:49.159
I personally changed my prayers to help me Jehovah to endure,

00:12:49.159 --> 00:12:51.879
help me to be able to put up with the inconveniences

00:12:51.879 --> 00:13:13.419
of prison life.

00:13:13.419 --> 00:13:17.700
I never anticipated I would be free that day or that year.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.620
I was able to see that Jehovah can deliver his people

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:22.860
out of trial some situations.

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.779
Anytime he chooses is the right time.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:31.100
From those 26 years, I've learned lots of lessons.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:34.460
I learned that Jehovah listens to our concerns

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.940
and to be persecuted for his namesake

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.059
is of greater reward than the inconveniences.

00:13:40.059 --> 00:13:42.179
We don't know what tomorrow will bring

00:13:42.179 --> 00:13:44.259
and what might change.

00:13:44.259 --> 00:13:46.980
So there's no good that comes from being afraid of prison

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.419
or being afraid of persecution.

00:13:49.419 --> 00:13:51.379
We can prepare for persecution.

00:13:52.379 --> 00:13:55.820
Jehovah will help us endure any trial.

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.179
We just have to ask for his help.

00:13:58.179 --> 00:14:02.059
Whatever circumstances, expected or unexpected that arise,

00:14:02.059 --> 00:14:04.220
this is a lesson I learned.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.500
Jehovah will help us endure.

00:14:07.379 --> 00:14:10.340
Many individuals kept supporting us through letters

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:12.539
and other supplies from everywhere.

00:14:12.539 --> 00:14:15.100
The tireless prayers of our brothers and sisters

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.620
throughout the world,

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.419
the heavy young ones who couldn't even pronounce our names

00:14:19.419 --> 00:14:22.179
but were praying for us, strengthened us.

00:14:23.019 --> 00:14:26.139
Continue praying because there are many others

00:14:26.139 --> 00:14:46.820
who are in various prisons now.

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:51.019
Thank you for sharing your experience with us, Negeri.

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:56.220
It's so encouraging to hear how Jehovah

00:14:56.220 --> 00:15:01.220
sustained you despite such brutal treatment.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.620
You are an integrity keeper

00:15:04.659 --> 00:15:07.580
and we love you very much.

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:13.860
I know I'm not alone in saying that we

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:18.139
supplicated Jehovah in your behalf many times

00:15:18.139 --> 00:15:20.820
over the course of the 26 years

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.460
that you and the other brothers were in prison.

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:28.299
And we continue to pray for the 32 brothers and sisters

00:15:28.299 --> 00:15:32.980
in Eritrea who are still in prison for their faith.

00:15:34.659 --> 00:15:37.139
What are some lessons that we can take away

00:15:37.139 --> 00:15:39.659
from Negeri's interview?

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.059
Briefly here are three.

00:15:43.059 --> 00:15:47.539
Number one, read the daily text every day.

00:15:48.379 --> 00:15:53.379
Number two, rely on Jehovah in prayer and number three.

00:15:55.659 --> 00:15:59.139
You can be joyful despite persecution.

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:03.779
We're happy to inform you that they full interview

00:16:03.779 --> 00:16:08.779
with Negeri will be made available on jw.org

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:11.179
in the future.

00:16:12.299 --> 00:16:16.299
As we reflect on Negeri's endurance,

00:16:16.299 --> 00:16:19.740
we're reminded of all those who are currently

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:24.019
in during persecution are in prison for their faith.

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.139
Do your brothers and sisters in during persecution

00:16:28.139 --> 00:16:33.139
in Eritrea, Russia and in all other areas of the world

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:38.659
we are praying for you and we love you very much.

00:16:40.139 --> 00:16:43.259
From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:16:43.259 --> 00:16:46.659
this is J.W. Broadcasting.
