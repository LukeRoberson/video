00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.869
Our world is filled with breath-taking beauty.

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:14.869
Why did God create the earth in such a special way?

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:21.469
Even from space, it stands alone as wonderfully unique.

00:00:21.469 --> 00:00:27.780
God created the earth with an abundance of water.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:38.380
He placed it at just the right distance from the sun

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.380
and set its rotation at just the right speed.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:52.929
He gave it a moon to stabilize the earth tilt, contributing to consistent seasons.

00:00:52.929 --> 00:01:03.509
And he created an amazing variety of living creatures to share the earth with.

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:08.510
Why did God put forth so much effort to create this beautiful earth?

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:16.790
Because he wanted to give the first human couple, Adam and Eve, a wonderful home.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.790
As long as they obeyed God, they and their children would live forever

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.790
and expand the paradise garden to cover the entire globe.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.459
This was God's purpose for the earth.

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:34.459
So what happened?

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:38.459
Why isn't the earth a paradise?

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:43.459
Sadly, Adam and Eve chose to disobey God.

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:46.459
They eventually grew old and died.

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:49.459
Paradise was lost.

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:55.459
But did this mean that God's original purpose for the earth had changed?

00:01:55.459 --> 00:02:00.459
Imagine that a father decides to build a beautiful home for his son.

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:13.020
He gives it to him as a gift, but instead of being thankful,

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.020
the son neglects his father's gift and the house falls into disrepair.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.389
What would a loving father do?

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:27.389
Would he destroy the house and all his hard work?

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:35.889
No, he would patiently save it for a family member who would appreciate it.

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:49.039
In a similar way, although Adam rejected the gift,

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:55.039
the Bible tells us that God didn't change his purpose for the earth.

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:58.039
His purpose still stands.

00:02:58.039 --> 00:03:04.039
He wants to give this gift an earthwide paradise to you,

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:09.039
to enjoy in happiness and health forever.

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:14.039
You may wonder, how will paradise be restored?

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:17.039
How can you live forever on earth?

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:26.909
