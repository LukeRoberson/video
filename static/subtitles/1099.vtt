There are millions of Jehovah's Witnesses around the world, each finding a way to be joyful.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:20.579
Despite the trials we face, we can find joy.

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:33.729
In the choices we're making, in the families we're raising, from the creation we're observing,

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:43.130
from the peace we're promoting.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.700
Joy is found in the message we're preaching.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:01:01.020
Jehovah promises us joy, despite the trials we're enduring and persecution we're facing.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.019
He promises us joy through the stand we're taking.

00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:12.019
Through anything in life, you can find joy in Jehovah.

00:01:12.019 --> 00:01:15.019
He wants you to be happy.

00:01:16.019 --> 00:01:21.019
His joy can be yours now and forever.

00:01:21.019 --> 00:01:25.019
So, will you accept it?
