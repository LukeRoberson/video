00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:06.820
I want to explore something that the Watchtower states about today's text.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.699
It says that the meetings never overlook the powerful effect you can have on others by

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:16.899
raising your hand and offering up building comments.

00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:19.140
Now how does the day's text support that statement?

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.899
Well, let's open up to Proverbs 1523 and read the entire verse.

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:28.940
Proverbs 1523.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.179
It says, a man rejoices in giving the right answer.

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:38.219
And a word spoken at the right time, how good it is.

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.939
And who of us has not had our faith built up and strengthened by a sincere, heartfelt

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:47.460
comment made by a brother or sister during a congregation meeting?

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.140
Whether it was the wise expressions of an older person with decades of experience in the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.859
truth, the timid but sincere answer of a shy or new one in the truth,

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.780
or those simple, honest words of a young child.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.819
All these individuals are doing just with the Psalmist David love doing.

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:20.040
If you look at Psalm 22, verse 22, Psalm 22 and 22, he said to Jehovah,

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.599
I will declare your name to my brothers.

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:27.840
In the midst of the congregation, I will praise you.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.799
And it is true that one way to praise Jehovah is by commenting during our Christian

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.400
meetings, giving voice to our Bible-based beliefs.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.280
From my experience in the congregations that I've been with, I've seen those who are

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.879
always engaged in every meeting.

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:46.959
They love to comment.

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:52.000
They'll give several comments in the Watchtower study, congregation Bible study, and

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.439
another meeting participation parts in the midweek meeting.

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.799
There are others who comment, but not so often, not so regularly.

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.319
They may give one comment at most meetings.

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:08.240
And then there are some who it seems rarely if ever comment.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.000
They're satisfied to let the rest of the congregation carry the discussion.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Which are you?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.479
Well, I think we can safely say that if David were alive today in our congregations, he

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:25.240
surely would be one of those who participates often at every meeting.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.159
And we should understand that this matter of commenting at meetings is very important.

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:35.520
We can say that because of what the Apostle Paul wrote at Hebrews chapter 13.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:44.930
Hebrews 13, and it's verse 15, he said through him that is Christ, let us always offer to

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.610
God a sacrifice of praise.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.530
That is the fruit of our lips that make public declaration to his name.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.330
Now, of course, one way we can do that is by preaching the good news of the kingdom

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.129
to anyone who will listen to us.

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:04.650
But another way to do this is by making expressions of our faith and hope at the meetings in front

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.889
of our brothers.

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:11.449
Now when writing specifically about congregation meetings, remember what Paul wrote at Hebrews

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:19.250
chapter 10, starting with verse 23, let us hold firmly the public declaration of our

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.650
hope without wavering for the one who promised his faithful and let us consider one another.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:32.050
So as to incite to love and find works, not forsaking our meeting together.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.610
And participating in the meetings gives us a wonderful opportunity to continue offering

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.250
a sacrifice of praise, making our public declarations to Jehovah.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.729
And I think I can speak for every brother who conducts a meeting that we love to hear

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:51.129
as many different individuals as possible participate.

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:55.969
Although if you are one in the audience who finds it challenging to offer a comment, what

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:57.969
can help you?

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:04.969
Well, the January 2019 issue of the watch tower has a study article entitled Praise Jehovah

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:06.169
in the Congregation.

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:09.090
And here's what the preview paragraph says.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.569
Like the Psalmist David, all of us love Jehovah and enjoy praising him.

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.889
We have a special opportunity to express our love for God when we meet with our congregation

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:19.569
for worship.

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:23.250
Some of us, however, find it difficult to comment at our meetings.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.529
If you face that challenge, this article can help you identify your fears and work on

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:30.410
overcoming them.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:36.250
And the article does offer practical suggestions on how to prepare for and participate in the

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.769
meetings.

00:04:37.769 --> 00:04:42.949
For example, it has a box, what can I comment on, and I'd like to illustrate the first three

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.449
bullet points.

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:49.449
The direct answer to the question, a secondary point in the paragraph, and what

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.970
a sighted scripture teaches.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.850
And we can use a paragraph in the article to illustrate this.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:01.490
The paragraph is under the caption coping with fear and the aid question asks, what fear

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:02.889
do many of us have?

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:08.689
Well, the paragraph begins, do you get a knot in your stomach each time you even think

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:11.129
of raising your hand to comment?

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:13.370
If so, you are not alone.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.370
The truth is that most of us feel some fear when we comment.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.370
So what fear do many of us have?

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:26.850
A simple direct answer to the question is, most of us feel some fear when we comment.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.689
But now there is a secondary point in the paragraph that could be commented on.

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:36.089
It continues, before you can cope with this crippling feeling, you need to identify the

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:37.930
cause of your fear.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.769
Are you afraid that you will forget what you want to say, or that you will say the

00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:43.290
wrong thing?

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.889
Do you worry that your comment will not be as good as the comments of others?

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:52.970
The big question is, why might having a fear of answering be a good sign?

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.290
And the paragraph provides the answer.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.250
Actually those fears can be a good sign.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:04.009
They indicate that you are humble and view others as superior to you, Jehovah loves that

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:05.009
quality.

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:10.410
Now, if you want to go to another level in your commenting, explain what a cited scripture

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:11.410
teaches.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.449
And notice in this paragraph, there are three scriptures.

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:21.649
They are, Psalm 138.6, the point of which is that Jehovah takes note of the humble.

00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:26.769
Philippians 2.3, that with humility, we consider others superior to us.

00:06:26.769 --> 00:06:33.170
And first, Thessalonians 5.11, to keep encouraging one another and building one another up.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:39.850
And any one of those verses would make a basis for a good, additional comment.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.769
So in this one paragraph, we've isolated some meaningful comments that could be made,

00:06:44.769 --> 00:06:49.970
and how everyone would rejoice, either in being able to give the comment or in hearing

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.329
someone else present it.

00:06:52.329 --> 00:06:57.009
And of course, when we prepare well for the meetings, then we feel more confident about

00:06:57.009 --> 00:06:59.410
commenting.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:04.170
If you are a watchtower study conductor, what would you do if you see a significant point

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:07.490
in the paragraph that had not been commented on?

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:14.089
Well, that depends on whether you liken yourself to the sportscaster at a baseball game or

00:07:14.089 --> 00:07:16.930
to the pitcher on the mound.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:17.930
Why do we say that?

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:23.410
Well, a sportscaster gives a play-by-play commentary on what's going on during the game.

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:29.329
But that is not the role of a watchtower study conductor to talk excessively, to comment

00:07:29.329 --> 00:07:34.529
on every missed point in the article, to rephrase the comments that were already made, or to

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:36.089
sum up each paragraph.

00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:37.089
No.

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:41.930
Because all that may do is stifle audience participation, because it makes a friends

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:46.810
feel that their comments were not good enough to please the conductor.

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:50.889
Instead, if there's something important that was missed, the conductor who was on the

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:56.129
mound, the platform, can just pitch a question to the audience.

00:07:56.129 --> 00:08:00.170
For example, in this paragraph, the last sentence is significant.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:05.610
For a says of Jehovah, he loves you, and will give you the courage you need.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:10.329
So if no one commented on that point, the conductor might just ask, what would Jehovah

00:08:10.329 --> 00:08:14.889
do for you if you are fearful of commenting at the meetings?

00:08:14.889 --> 00:08:18.930
And then he can let someone in the audience have the joy of answering.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:25.129
Now, if you are a person who gets anxious about participating at the meetings and holds

00:08:25.129 --> 00:08:31.250
back, please take to heart how David felt about making his sacrifice of praise among

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:32.250
his brothers.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:44.340
Let's turn to Psalm number 40, Psalm 40, and it's verses 9 and 10.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:49.059
He said, I proclaim the good news of righteousness in the great congregation.

00:08:49.059 --> 00:08:51.940
Look, I do not restrain my lips.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:58.299
Oh, Jehovah, as you well know, I do not cover over your righteousness in my heart.

00:08:58.299 --> 00:09:01.139
I declare your faithfulness in salvation.

00:09:01.139 --> 00:09:07.220
I do not hide your loyal love and your truth in the great congregation.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:13.539
So let's be the sword who will uncover what is in our heart and give a full expression

00:09:13.539 --> 00:09:18.139
of our faith to Jehovah's praise and for the encouragement of our congregation.
