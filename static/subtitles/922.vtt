00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.410
Each year we look forward to the high-quality video presentations that have become a highlight

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.789
of our conventions.

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.030
Work is underway on videos and dramas for future conventions.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.630
The set construction and other work needed for the series, the good news according to

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.710
Jesus, is well along.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.469
Additionally, planning and construction of our new media production facility in the

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.990
United States is moving ahead steadily.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.310
All of these efforts are supported by voluntary donations.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.350
If you would like to have a share in supporting the worldwide work of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.629
one way you can do so is through your financial contributions.

00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:14.319
For more information, please visit donate.jw.org.

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:22.599
We have seen that Jehovah promises us a future filled with happiness and peace.

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:26.120
How will universal peace come about?

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.079
And what will it mean for mankind?

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:35.640
Please pay close attention to Brother Jeffrey Jackson, a member of the governing body.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.760
As he answers those questions in the final talk of this convention entitled,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:52.640
universal peace is sure to come.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.560
What is true peace?

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.719
For those who live in lands where they have wars, no doubt the focus they have on true

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:08.400
peace is to stop fighting, to stop the conflicts, to not have any wars.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.599
And it's true that peace does include an absence of war.

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:20.240
But in many cases the efforts of mankind to try and gain peace by stopping wars is similar

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.639
to what we say is a bandaid solution.

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:26.280
What do we mean by that?

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.560
Well a person may have a horrible sore, perhaps even cancerous.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.199
And if he just puts a bandaid over the top, maybe it hides the sore, but really doesn't

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:40.960
solve the problem, doesn't.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.039
Because peace is not just an end of war.

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:51.680
You know yourself, if you were to live in a country where there isn't any war, but still

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:57.639
you're worried about your health, your well-being and your safety.

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:02.960
If you feel sick and hungry, would you say that you're having a peaceful life?

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.479
Of course not.

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:12.080
According to the Bible, the word peace means far more than just an absence of war.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.159
It means good health, well-being and safety.

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:21.840
And from our convention, we've seen that there's a lot involved with true peace.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.280
It includes having a peaceful relationship with your hover guard.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.000
It also means having a peaceful relationship with others.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.759
And also, it includes the peace of heart and mind that gives us tranquility.

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:45.319
But now in this final talk, we're going to consider a bigger issue.

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.879
And that is universal peace.

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:53.280
Now what do we mean by universal peace?

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:00.280
What we mean by universal peace is the type of peace that is everywhere in heaven and

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.879
on earth, in all aspects of life.

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:09.360
It's the type of peace that only the God of peace Jehovah can bring along with the

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.159
Prince of Peace, Jesus Christ.

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:19.120
Soon, they will take dramatic steps toward the restoration of universal peace.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.839
Let's take our Bibles, and if we turn together to Romans chapter 16 and verse 20,

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:32.319
we'll see what's included in this restoration of universal peace.

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:36.759
That's Romans 16 and verse 20.

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:42.759
There we're told, for his part, the God who gives peace will crush Satan under your

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:44.759
feet shortly.

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:49.879
May the underserved kindness of our Lord Jesus be with you.

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:58.759
Yes, the restoration of universal peace also includes the crushing of Satan the devil.

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:04.759
So in our final discussion, the final talk of this convention, we're going to consider

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:07.519
four basic questions.

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:13.079
The first one is, when was universal peace disturbed?

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:17.879
Secondly, who will restore universal peace?

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:21.720
The third question, how will it be restored?

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.800
And then finally, we're going to think about what further blessings mankind will enjoy

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.399
at that time.

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:35.839
But before we go on to answer those questions, let's review together the program that we've

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:36.839
had.

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:37.839
I'm sure you'll agree.

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:44.720
This has been a beautiful convention, and it's encouraged us to pursue peace.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.560
But what are some of the good points that you remember from the program?

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.439
Well as we mentioned already, there are three aspects, the peace that we discuss.

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:58.680
First of all, our peace with Jehovah God.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.240
The Friday program finished with the final talk.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:09.680
And that's where it mentions about not being misled by imitation peace.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.600
And then Sunday, what a beautiful public discourse we had.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:19.560
It said that friendship with God, how possible.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.759
And then the second aspect of our peace is peace with one another.

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:30.160
The first day, remember, we had that beautiful symposium on family peace.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.639
What were some of the things that we need to do to have peace in our family?

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:37.560
Well, love and respect are important.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.480
We need to improve our communication with one another.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.839
We need to work as a team and worship together.

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:52.800
And then Saturday, we had another interesting symposium when it said about peace records,

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.199
things that can wreck peace.

00:06:55.199 --> 00:07:04.199
Remember some of those inappropriate boasting, envy, dishonesty, harmful gossip, and uncontrolled

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:06.439
anger.

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:13.279
And then the third aspect of peace deals with our personal peace, our inner calm despite

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:15.360
trials.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.399
On Saturday, we had a very interesting talk that mentions the need to safeguard our bond

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:22.399
of peace.

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:27.639
And then on Sunday, we went through another symposium where it gave examples of those

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:32.800
who had soared peace and then reaped peace.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.639
As we look through the program, I'm sure there's so many points that you can remember

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:38.480
that you enjoyed.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:44.399
Of course, one of the highlights at any convention is when we have the baptism.

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:49.199
If you were baptized at this convention, we'd like to welcome you.

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:55.040
Yes, welcome you to the Christian Brotherhood, because we know that you're working hard

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.959
to have peace with your over God.

00:07:58.959 --> 00:08:05.639
But now at this point, let's watch a video that gives us some lessons with regard to

00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:09.920
what we've saw in the various videos in this convention.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:22.120
Enjoy.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.120
Would she ever?

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.120
No, she would never.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.120
She's mean.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:30.079
It feels out of your control, doesn't it?

00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:38.320
Remember when we studied about the Shula, my girl, who was really in control?

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.919
She was.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:42.600
You have the same power.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.320
If you believe that, it'll change how you handle the pressure.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:51.080
My peace comes from doing the right thing.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.159
I am a wall.

00:08:53.159 --> 00:08:58.720
You're just a coward to get trash.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.120
Think about what the jailer had done to Paul.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.120
He could have hated him for it.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:09.799
Yeah, he could have, but I guess he saw the jailer's pain instead of just his own.

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:14.559
Let me show you just one scripture, all right, one scripture.

00:09:14.559 --> 00:09:26.590
Jehovah has taught us to love, and he's given our family peace.

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:27.590
Hello, everyone.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:29.269
Haley from Genoa Design here.

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:31.669
You don't think she's showing off?

00:09:31.669 --> 00:09:35.299
Is this just about Haley?

00:09:35.299 --> 00:09:36.899
Can you believe him?

00:09:36.899 --> 00:09:39.460
I haven't seen all her posts.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:45.580
If Celia agrees that Haley's doing something she shouldn't, you should talk to her.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:49.340
I've noticed you were post-lately on QuickPost.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:50.340
What about them?

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.220
Some people might think you're bragging.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.740
Who would think like that?

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:54.740
You.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:55.740
I didn't want to upset you.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:56.740
Jake said that I needed to take.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:57.740
Jake!

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:58.740
Set everyone.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:09:59.740
Things my posts are in a boat.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.740
That's not what I'm saying at all.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:02.740
You are such.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:11.139
Think that to a time when you wanted forgiveness.

00:10:11.139 --> 00:10:16.139
Love is patience and kind.

00:10:16.139 --> 00:10:20.139
It's not jealous.

00:10:20.139 --> 00:10:22.139
I'm sorry, Haley.

00:10:22.139 --> 00:10:25.139
Genuine affection fights peace-rikers.

00:10:25.139 --> 00:10:30.139
And affection grows when we really know our brothers and sisters well.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.960
I was always impressed with how close you two were.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:46.190
Well, it wasn't always that way.

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:49.190
What started as a small disagreement exploded.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.190
You!

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:51.190
You're the problem.

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:59.399
I needed a lot of help from Jova to make things right with Nick.

00:10:59.399 --> 00:11:01.399
There was a misunderstanding.

00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:04.399
I've blown a lot of proportion.

00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:08.399
And I didn't handle it the best.

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:11.399
That's when our peace was really put to the test.

00:11:11.399 --> 00:11:15.399
The body decided unanimously that he should know all of them.

00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:17.399
Because you pushed them.

00:11:17.399 --> 00:11:22.399
Phil didn't know just how tense things were between Tim and I.

00:11:22.399 --> 00:11:26.399
I found comfort in accounts of Jova's servants.

00:11:26.399 --> 00:11:30.399
They helped me realize that being a peace with my brothers

00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:34.399
was more important than any appointed position.

00:11:34.399 --> 00:11:37.940
It wasn't easy.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.940
But we talked it out.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.940
And we were able to make peace with Jova's help.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.940
Without peace, I don't know how we could have managed what was to come.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:56.460
At that moment, when you hear the verdict that you'll stay in prison,

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:59.460
it's like you've been knocked unconscious.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:04.460
But then, the doors of the elevator opened up.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:16.740
And in front of us, that's Jova.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:21.539
When you're just about to lose all your strength,

00:12:21.539 --> 00:12:24.539
Jova does that something for you.

00:12:24.539 --> 00:12:28.539
The Russian brothers and sisters, I pray for them constantly,

00:12:28.539 --> 00:12:34.549
because they are going through a very tough time.

00:12:34.549 --> 00:12:48.750
What I've learned from all of this is peace isn't from what's outside,

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.750
from what's going on, or what you're experiencing.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:55.750
I've learned that peace is on the inside,

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:59.750
and that comes from Jova.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:10.820
Priceless lessons, those were.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.820
But now, at this point, friends,

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:19.820
we're going to turn our attention to that bigger issue, universal peace.

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.820
Remember the first question we're going to answer?

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:28.740
When was universal peace disturbed?

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.740
Before mankind was created,

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:35.740
universal peace existed for countless ages.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:41.740
It was just like a beautiful pond of water that was undisturbed.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.740
No ripples, mirror-like interference.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:48.740
In other words, there was utmost harmony with Jova

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.740
and with all the spirit creatures.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:57.740
But then, it's just as if a rock was thrown into that beautiful pond.

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:01.740
And peace started to be disturbed.

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.740
When do you think that happened?

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:08.740
Well, we'll find the answer to that question by turning to the Bible,

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:14.740
and this time, if we look at 1st John, chapter 3 and verse 8.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:18.740
That's 1st John, chapter 3 and verse 8.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:23.740
Notice the answer to the question, when did the problem start?

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:31.980
There we're told, the one who practices sin originates with the devil,

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:36.980
because the devil has been sinning from the beginning.

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:40.980
For this purpose, the Son of God was made manifest,

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:43.980
to break up the works of the devil.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.980
So, notice the answer to the question,

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:50.980
because the devil has been sinning from the beginning,

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.980
as the footnote says, from the time that he began.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:58.980
Does that mean, right from the very time when he was created?

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.980
No, he wasn't the devil, then was he?

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:04.980
He was a perfect angel.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:09.980
So, when was it that this universal peace started to be disturbed?

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:14.980
When was it that the ripples started to go through the universe?

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:19.980
Well, you might remember that it wasn't at the time that he deceived

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.980
Eve. It's a little bit like the Bible says,

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:26.980
with a woman who gives birth to a child.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.980
That's not when the child's life starts, is it?

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:31.980
That's well before then.

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:38.980
So, likewise, this disruption of the universal peace began in heaven first.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:44.980
At the time that the angel who became Satan started to cover the position of Jehovah,

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.980
to want worship from others.

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:51.980
And by doing this, he alienated himself from God,

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:55.980
and no longer was he in harmony with Jehovah's will.

00:15:55.980 --> 00:16:01.980
Then, that sinful attitude was manifested in the Garden of Eden.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:08.980
That's when he took the next step and started to disturb the peace of Adam and Eve.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.980
And of course, they lost their peace with God.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:16.980
But let's take a moment and think about what was really involved

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:21.980
with those events there in the Garden of Eden.

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:26.980
Some very important issues were raised.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:30.980
Remember how Satan, first of all, spoke to Eve?

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.980
He asked what seemed like a ridiculous question.

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:38.980
Is it true that God hasn't allowed you to eat from any tree in the Garden,

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:40.980
all the trees abandoned?

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.980
Well, of course, that's ridiculous.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.980
But what was he doing?

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:50.980
He was calling into question Jehovah's qualities.

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:54.980
Yes, he was inferring that Jehovah may not be so generous.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:58.980
Maybe he's stingy, perhaps he's holding things back from Adam and Eve

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.980
that they really should have.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:05.980
And then, Satan went one step further.

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:10.980
He said, you will not die.

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:13.980
Really, what he was saying is,

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.980
Jehovah is alive.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:20.980
What a horrible accusation.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:24.980
Sadly, Eve didn't defend Jehovah.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:27.980
We would have expected that she would have said to Satan,

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:29.980
who are you?

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:30.980
I don't know you.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.980
Why would I believe you?

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.980
I know my loving Heavenly Father, Jehovah,

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:41.980
but no, she sided with the devil.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:43.980
So what would Jehovah do?

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.980
Well, think for a moment about this.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:50.980
What if someone accused you wrongly in front of everybody,

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:55.980
calling you a liar, saying all sorts of bad things about you?

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.980
What would you do?

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:00.980
Would you go and punch them in the face?

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:03.980
Well, if you did, that wouldn't be the right thing to do.

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:07.980
And it certainly wouldn't answer the questions raised.

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:12.980
You see, was that person really true in what they said or not?

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.980
How would you probably solve this?

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:18.980
Well, you may take the person to court.

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:22.980
And in that court case, that person could offer whatever evidence

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:25.980
they feel they have to prove that you're a liar.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:29.980
On the other hand, you can produce witnesses to prove

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:34.980
that really you aren't a liar, but you're very truthful.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.980
And then finally, there would be a decision made

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.980
as to who was right and who was wrong.

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:45.980
Well, in a similar way, these issues, these questions raised

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.980
in the Garden of Eden, started a symbolic court case.

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:52.980
So how did Jehovah respond?

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:57.980
Wisely, he allowed time to settle these issues.

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:03.980
He allowed Satan the opportunity to try and rule mankind,

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.980
to do things his way.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:11.980
At the same time, mercifully, he provided the hope

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:15.980
for the unborn children of Adam and Eve.

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.980
You remember in Genesis 3 verse 15,

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:21.980
it speaks of an offspring or a son

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:25.980
who would come later and eventually undo the bad

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.980
that Satan had done there in the beginning,

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:32.980
and eventually free mankind from sin and death.

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:38.980
But what has Satan been doing since this opportunity has been given to him?

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:41.980
He is still craving worship from other people.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:45.980
He wants them to bow down to him and acknowledge him as their God.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:51.980
He also uses lies and deceit to blind the minds of persons.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:56.980
And he also has great anger, particularly at this time in history

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:58.980
where he knows his end is near.

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:02.980
And so he's influencing the world to hate anyone

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:06.980
who stands up on Jehovah's side.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:10.980
But now let's think about a very interesting question.

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:15.980
Even though we're living in a world that is ruled by Satan,

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:21.980
is it possible at all for us to have a measure of peace with God?

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:25.980
We're experiencing so many trials and challenges.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.980
We face opposition, we have illness,

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:31.980
economic problems, disasters.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.980
Is it possible to have some measure of peace?

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:38.980
The answer is found again in the scriptures.

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:40.980
And this time if you turn with me please,

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:45.980
to the book of 2 Corinthians chapter 1.

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:52.980
2 Corinthians chapter 1 and verses 3 and 4.

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.980
Notice this beautiful promise.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:21:00.980
Praise be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.980
the Father of tender mercies,

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:06.980
and the God of all comfort,

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:10.980
who comforts us in all our trials

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:14.980
so that we may be able to comfort others in any sort of trial

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:18.980
with the comfort that we receive from God.

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.980
Isn't that a beautiful scripture?

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:23.980
What does it highlight?

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:27.980
Notice, Jehovah obviously is aware of our suffering.

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.980
He feels for us.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:32.980
He wants to help us.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.980
It mentions He's the Father of tender mercies.

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:40.980
But at the same time we realize that Jehovah won't step in

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:42.980
and fix all our problems at this point.

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:43.980
Why?

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:47.980
Because this is the time that Satan has the opportunity

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:49.980
to try and rule the world.

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:54.980
And the problems of this world really come from Satan.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:58.980
At the same time we wouldn't expect Jehovah to step in

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:03.980
and start to solve the problems as if he were helping Satan the devil.

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:08.980
But there is a time when Satan will be taken away

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:11.980
and the problems will be solved.

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:14.980
We can think of Jehovah's position

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:20.980
similar to that of a father whose son is running in a marathon race.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:23.980
As he sees his son running in the race,

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:26.980
he may see the son is starting to tire out.

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:30.980
Or perhaps he may see that others in the race are not obeying the rules.

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:33.980
Does that mean that the father then jumps in

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:37.980
and takes a place of his son and helps him as he runs along?

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.980
No, the rules don't allow it.

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.980
But what the father can do is continue to encourage his son.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:44.980
Keep on going.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:46.980
Yes, you can do it.

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:51.980
So in a similar way, what did this verse tell us?

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:55.980
It said that Jehovah gives us comfort.

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:57.980
How does he do that?

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:01.980
He gives us peace by means of his word the Bible,

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:03.980
by means of Holy Spirit,

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:07.980
and by the loving brotherhood that we have.

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:11.980
So at this point what we'd like to do is have a look at a video

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:20.259
that will highlight how Jehovah lovingly helps us even in times of need.

00:23:20.259 --> 00:23:28.240
We are living in critical times.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.240
Hard to deal with.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:36.240
Many people have lost all hope.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:42.240
And servants of Jehovah are not free from trials.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:46.240
We may face loss of property,

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:50.900
loss of health,

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:56.019
loss of loved ones.

00:23:56.019 --> 00:24:01.019
We may experience deep emotional trauma

00:24:01.019 --> 00:24:05.019
or even imprisonment for our faith.

00:24:05.019 --> 00:24:13.500
Our trials are similar to those of Job,

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:18.500
a faithful servant of Jehovah who was so saddened that he once asked

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:24.980
why didn't I die at birth?

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:27.980
Perhaps we've had moments like that.

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:31.980
But why should we not lose hope?

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:39.900
Because with every trial comes Jehovah's support.

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:43.900
Support received in many forms.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:25:01.099
Material support.

00:25:01.099 --> 00:25:03.099
Emotional support.

00:25:03.099 --> 00:25:33.720
And spiritual support.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:38.720
And while Jehovah will not remove all our trials now,

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:46.319
we trust that with his support we can endure them

00:25:46.319 --> 00:25:51.319
until they disappear in the real life to come.

00:25:51.319 --> 00:25:54.319
Psalm 34, 17 and 18 says,

00:25:54.319 --> 00:25:58.319
they cried out and Jehovah heard.

00:25:58.319 --> 00:26:02.319
He saves those who are crushed in spirit.

00:26:02.319 --> 00:26:09.740
So we can see even though our peace has been disturbed,

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:13.740
we can enjoy peace with God.

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.740
So let's think about our second question.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:18.740
Remember that question was,

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:22.740
who will restore universal peace?

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:28.740
But we already saw the answer when we refer to Genesis chapter 3 verse 15,

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:30.740
the first prophecy in the Bible.

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:33.740
It mentioned the promise of spring or sun,

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:37.740
and that one is Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace.

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:43.740
He has the key role in restoring universal peace.

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:49.740
Very soon, he's going to take the decisive action to remove this whole world

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:57.740
and then take progressive steps toward the restoration of universal peace.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:02.740
But why can we be so sure that Jesus will come soon?

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:09.740
It's a very simple answer by seeing the current events that are happening in the world today.

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:14.740
Yes, as we look around us, we see so many things that are happening

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:21.740
that prove to us that Jesus will soon step in to help us.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.740
Now how can we say that?

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:31.740
Well, let's have a look together at their famous prophecy that's recorded in Matthew chapter 24.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:36.740
Matthew chapter 24 and verse 3.

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:43.740
Remember the apostles at this particular time were asking Jesus a very important question.

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:47.740
It's at the second part of verse 3.

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:49.740
It says they asked,

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:56.740
tell us when will these things be and what will be the sign of your presence

00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:00.740
and of the conclusion of the system of things.

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:05.740
Now you remember no doubt from your previous studies of the Bible,

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:11.740
how Jesus then went on to list many events that would occur during the last days.

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:20.740
He mentioned wars, he mentioned earthquakes, he mentioned famines and all sorts of pestilences.

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:25.740
Truly, we have seen those things happen in recent times.

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:29.740
In addition to all of that Matthew 24 verse 14,

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:33.740
mentioned the need to preach the good news of the kingdom.

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:39.740
But there could be some who perhaps may doubt a little and say,

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:42.740
well, there's been wars all through time.

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:49.740
There's been earthquakes at other times, not just in the last days and for shortages.

00:28:49.740 --> 00:29:00.740
So why can we be so sure that this is the time when we know that Jesus will soon bring about an end to wickedness?

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:03.740
Well, let's use an illustration.

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:07.740
Most of us are familiar with using a computer.

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:15.740
Now when you sit at your computer, what's the first thing that you need to do after you've turned it on?

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:19.740
Usually you have to type in a password, don't you?

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:21.740
And you have to get it right.

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:25.740
You have to put in all those numbers and letters that are required.

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:30.740
Otherwise, you won't be able to start working on the computer.

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:36.740
Now these days, people are very concerned about having strong passwords.

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:44.089
What do you think if you had a password that had 24 different letters and numbers?

00:29:44.089 --> 00:29:47.089
That's a very strong password.

00:29:47.089 --> 00:29:56.089
And it would be very difficult for someone just randomly to try and find out what those numbers were and unlock your computer.

00:29:56.089 --> 00:30:00.089
Well, how does that relate to the sign that Jesus gave?

00:30:00.089 --> 00:30:05.089
Notice that if you look back at Matthew 24 verse 3,

00:30:05.089 --> 00:30:15.089
the question was not the signs of your presence, but the sign, just like a password, one sign.

00:30:15.089 --> 00:30:19.089
But then that sign has many different features.

00:30:19.089 --> 00:30:23.089
In fact, at least 24 different features.

00:30:25.339 --> 00:30:34.339
So even though there have been wars in the past, this is the time when we see all those features coming together at one time,

00:30:34.339 --> 00:30:40.339
and in that way we could say it opens the fulfillment of Bible prophecy.

00:30:40.339 --> 00:30:44.339
Yes, as we look around us, as we listen to the news each day,

00:30:44.339 --> 00:30:50.339
we can see that there is a definite fulfillment of what Jesus said.

00:30:50.339 --> 00:30:53.339
Truly, the end is close.

00:30:53.339 --> 00:30:57.339
It's just like a jigsaw puzzle to use another illustration.

00:30:57.339 --> 00:31:02.339
When you have all the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle and you start to put them all together,

00:31:02.339 --> 00:31:07.339
eventually when all the pieces are in place, the picture is clear, isn't it?

00:31:07.339 --> 00:31:14.339
And that's exactly how we should feel about the prophecy that Jesus gave.

00:31:14.339 --> 00:31:20.339
Soon, very soon, he is going to step in and take action.

00:31:20.339 --> 00:31:27.339
But of course, sometimes we may feel, yes, we've known about this for quite some time.

00:31:27.339 --> 00:31:32.339
And it means that we've had to wait a long time.

00:31:32.339 --> 00:31:38.339
But that doesn't negate the fact that the evidence of the last days is here.

00:31:38.339 --> 00:31:41.339
Perhaps we could illustrate it this way.

00:31:41.339 --> 00:31:48.339
Most of us have gone to an airport to meet someone who's coming maybe from overseas or another part of the country.

00:31:48.339 --> 00:31:57.339
Now, since 9-11 is very hard to go to an airport and actually stand on the side of the runway and see the plane land.

00:31:57.339 --> 00:31:59.339
Usually, what happens?

00:31:59.339 --> 00:32:04.339
Once you get to the airport, you are allowed to go into a large room with other people,

00:32:04.339 --> 00:32:07.339
and all you see are monitors on the wall.

00:32:07.339 --> 00:32:10.339
Now, what may the monitor say?

00:32:10.339 --> 00:32:14.339
Well, you see it says there the flight has left.

00:32:15.339 --> 00:32:19.339
Then later, maybe the monitor says the flight is on time.

00:32:19.339 --> 00:32:23.339
Then it says the flight has landed.

00:32:23.339 --> 00:32:27.339
Then it says the flight is taxi.

00:32:27.339 --> 00:32:29.339
Then it says at the gate.

00:32:29.339 --> 00:32:33.339
Well, now you say you get really excited, aren't you?

00:32:33.339 --> 00:32:37.339
And yet you haven't seen the plane and you haven't seen your friend yet.

00:32:38.339 --> 00:32:45.339
But you can see from the indications of what you see on the monitor that it must be close.

00:32:45.339 --> 00:32:49.339
And then all of a sudden the doors open, people start to come out.

00:32:49.339 --> 00:32:54.339
Well, now you're really excited because you know, yes, you're going to meet your friend.

00:32:54.339 --> 00:32:59.339
Well, that is similar to how we can view the last days.

00:32:59.339 --> 00:33:06.339
There's been a lot of things happening that we don't actually see, but we see the indications of what's happened.

00:33:06.339 --> 00:33:16.339
And we know that very soon Jesus, the angels and the 144,000 will take steps to remove this old world

00:33:16.339 --> 00:33:21.339
and then take further steps toward the restoration of peace.

00:33:21.339 --> 00:33:25.339
Isn't that a beautiful promise?

00:33:25.339 --> 00:33:29.339
So naturally, that takes us to the third question.

00:33:29.339 --> 00:33:33.339
How will universal peace be restored?

00:33:33.339 --> 00:33:36.339
What will Jesus need to do?

00:33:36.339 --> 00:33:41.339
Basically, we could say there are two actions required.

00:33:41.339 --> 00:33:47.339
One is to remove Satan and the peace disturbance.

00:33:47.339 --> 00:33:55.339
And then the second action is to undo all the evil that Satan has done.

00:33:55.339 --> 00:33:59.339
You see, we don't want a band-aid solution, do we?

00:33:59.339 --> 00:34:04.339
Just hiding something that's very serious by putting a band-aid over it.

00:34:04.339 --> 00:34:09.340
So not only does Jesus need to take away those that are disrupting the peace,

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:21.340
but He also has to take steps to heal mankind and to heal the earth so that all the evil, the bad things that Satan has done, will be overturned.

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:25.340
So let's think about those two actions for a moment.

00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:30.340
Remember, the first one is to remove the peace disturbance.

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:33.340
What steps are involved with that?

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:37.340
Remember, this is a progressive action.

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:44.340
If we take our Bibles and turn to the Book of Revelation, we'll see there are several things mentioned here

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:54.340
that help us to see how progressively Jesus has and will bring about this removal of peace disturbance.

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:58.340
If you turn with me, please, to Revelation chapter 12.

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:03.650
Let's read together verse 9. Revelation 12.

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:09.650
Now, immediately, no doubt you remember the Revelation 12 is talking about the time

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:13.650
when Jesus' government, His kingdom, was established in the heavens.

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:16.650
That was in 1914.

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:22.650
In verse 9, it mentions what happened shortly after that time.

00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:24.650
Let's read it.

00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:35.650
So down the great dragon was hauled, the original serpent, the one called devil in Satan, who is misleading the entire inhabited earth.

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:42.650
He was hauled down to the earth and His angels were hauled down with Him.

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:45.650
Do you notice that word that came up several times?

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:47.650
Hold down.

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:55.650
You see, Jesus didn't go and say to Satan, well, look, if you don't mind, we'd like you to relocate to the earth.

00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:57.650
Whenever you're ready.

00:35:57.650 --> 00:36:00.650
No, Satan was hauled down.

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:08.650
And what confidence that gives us, that means that Jesus has the power to be able to remove Satan from the heaven.

00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:13.650
That gives us some idea what's going to happen in the future with regard to the earth.

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:23.650
Of course, now we're living in a time when Satan and his demons are here in the vicinity of the earth and they are causing so much trouble.

00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:30.650
So what's another step that Jesus will take in removing those who disrupt the peace?

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:37.650
Well, let's look at another chapter in the same book, Revelation chapter 19.

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:46.650
Revelation chapter 19, and we're going to read, starting at verse 19, right through to 21.

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:53.650
We might mention before we start reading it, that here it describes political organizations,

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:58.650
kings and those who oppose Jesus and Jehovah God.

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:07.650
And in a symbolic way, it refers to these as beasts, as organizations that have disrupted the peace.

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:09.650
Let's see what happens to them.

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:20.650
And I saw the wild beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage war against the one seated on the horse and against his army.

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:23.650
Now, that one is Jesus Christ.

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:38.650
And the wild beast was caught and along with it the false prophet that performed in front of it the signs with which he misled those who received the mark of the wild beast and those who worshiped Him.

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:46.650
While still alive, they both were hurled into the fiery lake that burns with sulfur.

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:52.650
So what happens to these political organizations and opposition to Jehovah and Jesus?

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:57.650
Again, we see the word hurled down into destruction.

00:37:57.650 --> 00:38:02.650
And what about the rest of mankind that opposes Jesus' rule?

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:05.650
Well, let's look at verse 21.

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:07.650
What does it say?

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:14.650
But the rest were killed off with the long sword that proceeded out of the mouth of the one seated on the horse.

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:18.650
And all the birds were filled with their flesh.

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:22.650
Now, that's a very interesting comment, isn't it?

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:34.650
It helps us to see here that all those who oppose Jesus will be destroyed in the Battle of Armageddon.

00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:40.650
So that's another step in getting ready for universal peace.

00:38:40.650 --> 00:38:43.650
First of all, Satan is cast out of heaven.

00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:55.650
And then secondly, at Armageddon, all those humans who rebel against Jesus and reject his rule, they will be taken away, destroyed.

00:38:55.650 --> 00:39:00.650
But there's something else too. Let's look at chapter 20 of Revelation.

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:06.380
Chapter 20 and verses 1 through 3.

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:13.380
It says, and I saw an angel coming down out of heaven with the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:21.380
He seized the dragon, the original serpent, who was the devil and Satan and bound him for 1,000 years.

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:31.380
And he noticed the word again, hurled him into the abyss and shot it and sealed it over him so that he would not mislead the nations anymore

00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:34.380
until the thousand years were ended.

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:39.380
After this, he must be released for a little while.

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:43.380
What do we notice from this description?

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:54.380
You see, gradually, in a progressive manner, Jesus will eradicate and remove those who disrupt peace.

00:39:55.380 --> 00:40:03.380
So Satan and his demons cast down to the earth, at the Battle of Armageddon, those who rebel will be destroyed.

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:12.380
And then Satan will be put in a symbolic prison in this abyss for a thousand years, along with his demons.

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:20.380
So that's the first action that Jesus needs to do, to get rid of these troublemakers.

00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:31.380
That opens up the way for what the Bible refers to as the thousand year reign of Jesus Christ, with his kingdom and co-rulers.

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:37.380
What is going to happen during that thousand year reign?

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:42.380
Remember, we said it's not a bandaid type solution, isn't it?

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:48.380
He will need to help mankind and the earth to heal.

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:53.380
Notice please how this is described for us in a scripture that we've already read.

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:55.380
Let's turn to it again.

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:59.380
First, John chapter 3 and verse 8.

00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:07.380
Remember in the beginning of that verse, that's where it told us how universal peace was disrupted in the beginning.

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:13.380
At the time when that angel became the devil and started sinning.

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:18.380
But notice what it says in the second part of this verse.

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:25.380
For this purpose, the Son of God was made manifest to do what?

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:30.380
To break up or to destroy the works of the devil.

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:34.380
Isn't that an amazing concept?

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:42.380
Jesus not only removes those who disrupt peace, but he will break up the works of the devil, the things that he's done.

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:47.380
Over these thousands of years that he's been ruling this earth.

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:55.380
That means all the evil, all the suffering, death, all of that will be taken away.

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:59.380
Mankind will be gradually healed.

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:07.380
Now, Jesus started to break up the works of the devil when he willingly gave his life as a ransom.

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:14.380
So even now, we have the opportunity to gain a measure of peace with Jehovah and with others.

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:20.380
We can ask Jehovah for forgiveness based on the ransom sacrifice.

00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:27.380
But during the thousand year reign, there will be further things that Jesus will accomplish.

00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:31.380
Notice these three aspects.

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:35.380
He will undo all harm.

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:40.380
Now that includes sickness, war, disease, famine, all these problems.

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:43.380
All the harm will be undone.

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:50.380
He will also undo death by resurrecting those who have died.

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:58.380
And he will also undo sin by helping mankind to grow to perfection.

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:01.380
Isn't that a beautiful promise?

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:05.380
Undoing all these works of the devil.

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:11.380
And then by the end of the thousand years, what will we see with regard to the earth?

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:14.380
It will be a paradise.

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:19.380
It will be exactly as Jehovah purposed it to be in the beginning.

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:28.380
Yes, Jesus by means of the kingdom will have completely broken up the works of the devil.

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:33.380
Now, is that the time then when universal peace is restored?

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:37.380
No, not quite yet.

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:40.380
Why not? Something else has to happen.

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:44.380
And we're going to reread another scripture, and that's Romans 16.

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:47.380
Remember we referred to that in the beginning.

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:53.380
And here we see a very interesting connection between two different things.

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:57.380
So that's Romans 16, verse 20.

00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:03.380
For his part, the God who gives peace will do what?

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:08.380
Will crush Satan under your feet shortly?

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:11.380
Do we see the connection here?

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:18.380
Universal peace is connected with the crushing of Satan the devil.

00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:25.380
So universal peace can only be restored after Satan has been destroyed.

00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:31.380
Now, what events will occur leading up to Satan's destruction?

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:34.380
Or remember, as we read already in Revelation,

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:40.380
Satan is going to be allowed to be released from that prison, the symbolic prison,

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:47.380
and he'll have an opportunity to try to mislead people who are living on the earth at that time.

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:51.380
Those who join Satan will be destroyed forever.

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:56.380
Then, Satan will be permanently destroyed.

00:44:56.380 --> 00:45:02.380
But what will happen to those perfect persons who prove faithful to Jehovah?

00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:04.380
Let's see what the Bible says.

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:13.380
If we turn to the book of Romans, Romans chapter 8 and verse 21.

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:19.690
Romans 8, verse 21, that the creation itself

00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:23.690
will also be set free from enslavement to corruption

00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:28.690
and have the glorious freedom of the children of God.

00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:30.690
What does that really mean?

00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:38.690
It means that at that point, everyone will become part of Jehovah's Universal family.

00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:45.690
All intelligent creatures in heaven and on earth will be united as one family

00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:49.690
in the pure worship of the One True God, Jehovah.

00:45:49.690 --> 00:45:53.690
What a beautiful time that will be.

00:45:53.690 --> 00:46:01.690
But what further blessings are involved with this process of gradually bringing universal peace?

00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:07.690
Well, during the thousand-year reign of Jesus, there's going to be wonderful blessings.

00:46:07.690 --> 00:46:12.690
Those who are obedient to Jehovah in Jesus will experience the things

00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:17.690
that were described in the Bible book of Psalms in Psalm 72.

00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:19.690
Let's turn that together.

00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:22.690
Psalm 72.

00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:31.690
And here we see portrayed some very interesting prophetic statements about the thousand-year reign.

00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:34.690
You'll notice at the beginning it says regarding Solomon.

00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:40.690
So, although initially this was referring to an extent with regard to Solomon,

00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:43.690
Jesus mentioned that he's greater than Solomon.

00:46:43.690 --> 00:46:48.690
So, this has a prophetic application to the thousand-year reign.

00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:51.690
Let's see what it says about peace.

00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:53.690
Starting at verse 1.

00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:56.690
We'll go through to verse 4.

00:46:56.690 --> 00:47:00.690
Oh, God, give your judgments to the King,

00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:04.690
and endow the Son of the King with your righteousness.

00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:08.690
May He plead the cause of your people with righteousness

00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:11.690
and of your lowly ones with justice.

00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:15.690
May the mountains bring peace to the people,

00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:18.690
and may the hills bring righteousness.

00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:21.690
Let Him defend the lowly among the people,

00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:27.690
let Him save the sons of the poor, and let Him crush the defraudah.

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:32.690
What a beautiful description of what will happen in the thousand-year reign.

00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:40.690
Yes, all those who under Satan's rule will lowly, beaten up, disadvantaged,

00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:47.690
all these will experience relief because of the righteous rule of Jesus Christ.

00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:51.690
Let's go down a little further to verses 12 through 14.

00:47:51.690 --> 00:47:56.690
It tells us a little more about what Jesus will accomplish.

00:47:56.690 --> 00:47:59.690
Starting in verse 12, we're told,

00:47:59.690 --> 00:48:02.690
for He will rescue the poor who cry for help.

00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:07.690
Also the lowly one and whoever has no helper,

00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:10.690
He will have pity on the lowly and the poor,

00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:13.690
and the lives of the poor He will save.

00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:17.690
From oppression and from violence He will rescue them,

00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:21.690
and notice this very interesting expression,

00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:26.690
and their blood will be precious in His eyes.

00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:32.690
What does that mean? Their blood will be precious in His eyes.

00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:37.690
In the Bible usually the word blood is associated with life, isn't it?

00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:45.690
So it's saying that each person's life will be precious to Jesus Christ.

00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:51.690
What a beautiful description of what will happen during the thousand-year reign.

00:48:51.690 --> 00:48:55.690
Then if we go back a little to verse 5,

00:48:55.690 --> 00:49:03.690
we'll notice that this part of the Psalm helps us to see how widespread peace will be at that point.

00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:06.690
It uses very picturesque language.

00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:08.690
Notice there in verse 5, it says,

00:49:08.690 --> 00:49:12.690
they will fear you as long as there is a sun.

00:49:12.690 --> 00:49:16.690
Well, we know the sun continues on, so they'll continue to fear Him,

00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:21.690
and as long as the moon remains for generation after generation.

00:49:21.690 --> 00:49:25.690
He will be like the rain that falls on the moon grass,

00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:29.690
like showers of rain that water the earth.

00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:32.690
In His days the righteous will flourish,

00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:36.690
and peace will abound until the moon is no more.

00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:40.690
He will have subjects from sea to sea,

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:44.690
and from the river to the ends of the earth.

00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:52.690
Yes, what a beautiful description of the peaceful arrangements that will prevail

00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:57.690
during the thousand-year reign of Jesus Kingdom.

00:49:57.690 --> 00:50:02.690
But then the thousand-year finishes.

00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:07.690
What can we expect when that rain ends?

00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:13.690
I'm sure you're going to enjoy our consideration of a very special part of the Scriptures.

00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:15.690
1 Corinthians chapter 15.

00:50:15.690 --> 00:50:17.690
Please turn there with me,

00:50:17.690 --> 00:50:25.690
and we're going to go through and look at what these verses tell us about after the end of the thousand-year reign.

00:50:25.690 --> 00:50:36.940
The section of Scripture we're going to consider is 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verses 24 through 28.

00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:39.940
Starting in verse 24 we're told.

00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:45.940
Next, the end, when He hands over the Kingdom to His God and Father,

00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:51.940
when He has brought to nothing all government and all authority and power.

00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:57.940
For He must rule as King until God has put all enemies under His feet,

00:50:57.940 --> 00:51:02.940
and the last enemy death is to be brought to nothing.

00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:06.940
For God subjected all things under His feet.

00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:10.940
But when He says that all things have been subjected,

00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:16.940
it is evident that this does not include the one who subjected all things to Him.

00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:19.940
But when all things will have been subjected to Him,

00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:27.940
then the Son Himself will also subject Himself to the one who subjected all things to Him.

00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:34.820
That God may be all things to everyone.

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:39.820
What do these verses tell us about the end of the thousand-year reign?

00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:42.820
Well, let's go back to verse 24.

00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:46.820
There it says, next, the end.

00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:50.820
Now, this end mentioned here is not Armageddon.

00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:56.170
This is the end of the thousand-year reign.

00:51:56.170 --> 00:52:02.170
At the end of the thousand-year reign, there are some other things too that will have finished.

00:52:02.170 --> 00:52:07.170
That means for a start the end of the Kingdom arrangement.

00:52:07.170 --> 00:52:16.170
There will also be an end to sin, which means that mankind will no longer need the ransom or a mediator or priesthood.

00:52:16.170 --> 00:52:19.170
And then, verse 26, notice it says,

00:52:19.170 --> 00:52:23.170
the last enemy death is brought to nothing.

00:52:23.170 --> 00:52:26.170
In other words, the graves will be emptied.

00:52:26.170 --> 00:52:31.170
Those who have experienced the Adamic death will have been brought back.

00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:39.170
Mankind will all attain to perfection with the end of sin, Adamic sin.

00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:47.170
So at that point in time, something very, very special happens.

00:52:47.170 --> 00:52:49.170
What is it?

00:52:49.170 --> 00:52:58.170
Well, let's go back in the beginning of our discussion when we talked about the problems that occurred in the Garden of Eden.

00:52:58.170 --> 00:53:09.170
Remember, Satan the Devil raised some issues that resulted in a symbolic court case that involves the sanctification of Jehovah's name.

00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:21.170
Yes, Satan had claimed that Jehovah is a liar, that he doesn't rule mankind out of love, even raised a question later about who would actually serve Jehovah.

00:53:22.170 --> 00:53:29.170
So this issue has continued on the issue of the sanctification of Jehovah's name right down through history.

00:53:29.170 --> 00:53:33.170
And over and over again, Jehovah's name has been sanctified.

00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:36.170
His reputation has been vindicated.

00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:42.170
We can see that he's a loving God, unlike Satan, such a horrible person.

00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:48.170
But Jehovah has stood out as being the loving Heavenly Father.

00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:58.170
So now at this point in time, we can say the universal court case comes to a conclusion.

00:53:58.170 --> 00:54:02.170
The issue is settled, the verdict is given.

00:54:02.170 --> 00:54:04.170
In what way?

00:54:04.170 --> 00:54:11.170
Well, Jesus has just finished ruling mankind for a thousand years along with the 144,000.

00:54:11.170 --> 00:54:17.170
They've made the earth a paradise, mankind is now no longer sinners, they're perfect.

00:54:17.170 --> 00:54:20.170
All the problems have been healed.

00:54:20.170 --> 00:54:24.170
So at this point in time, what does Jesus do?

00:54:24.170 --> 00:54:31.170
Does he follow the example of Satan and say, well, you know, I think we did a very, very good job for this thousand years.

00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:37.170
So let's just keep everything in place and we'll keep on ruling in the kingdom.

00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:40.170
No, we saw what he does.

00:54:40.170 --> 00:54:51.170
At that point in time, there's a marvelous answer in this court case because Jesus hands over the kingdom back to his father.

00:54:51.170 --> 00:55:01.170
He submits to Jehovah's rule and it's just as if Jehovah is told by his loving son, Jesus, you were right all along.

00:55:01.170 --> 00:55:07.170
This whole thing has been a terrible travesty of justice.

00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:18.170
Satan is a despicable liar and all mankind, including Jesus and 144,000, submits themselves to Jehovah's rule issue.

00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:28.420
Yes, the end of the universal issue, Jehovah will then rule directly over perfect mankind.

00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:33.420
But is that the point in time when universal peace is restored?

00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:36.420
No, remember, there's some other things that need to occur.

00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:41.420
We've already mentioned that Satan will be released from his symbolic prison.

00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:45.420
He'll have an opportunity to try and mislead some.

00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:53.420
And those who side with him, Jehovah morally and ethically doesn't have to wait any longer and say, well, let's have another court case.

00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:58.420
No, they are executed immediately.

00:55:58.420 --> 00:56:01.420
But what about the rest of mankind?

00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:04.420
They become Jehovah's sons and daughters.

00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:11.420
They can talk to him directly without the need of a mediator and their names will be written permanently in the book of life.

00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:16.420
They'll be approved to live forever in paradise.

00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:24.420
So at this point, when we're thinking about all these beautiful things that will occur, let's enjoy the final video of our convention.

00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:29.420
It highlights the blessings of the thousand year reign and beyond.

00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:36.420
And also, we're going to listen to the original song that we'll sing at the conclusion of our program.

00:57:17.079 --> 00:57:33.280
To the ends of the earth, there'll be peace and life eternity.

00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:59.769
To the mountains past, all earth and in heaven.

00:57:59.769 --> 00:58:15.519
And the peace will never known before by just the similar.

00:58:15.519 --> 00:59:07.940
To the ends of the time.

00:59:07.940 --> 01:00:17.340
What a beautiful song and what beautiful images to encourage us.

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:22.340
So brothers and sisters, we've enjoyed our convention program, Heavenly.

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:30.340
Let us be determined to keep pursuing peace, not an imitation piece, but the real peace.

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:36.340
We can enjoy rich blessings now by having a peaceful relationship with Jehovah God.

01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:40.340
Yes, trying to continue to maintain peace with one another.

01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:45.340
And also attaining to this inner peace, calmness and tranquility.

01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:49.340
Because we have friendship with the God who gives us hope.

01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:55.340
And that hope helps us to look to the future even though we have difficulties now.

01:00:55.340 --> 01:01:01.340
And we look forward to the time when universal peace is finally restored.

01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:09.340
But in the meantime, may the God of peace be with each one of you now and forever.

01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:13.349
Thank you, Brother Jackson.

01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:20.349
Your talk and this entire convention have strengthened our confidence in Jehovah's prophetic word.

01:01:20.349 --> 01:01:24.349
And helped us to understand how close we are to its fulfillment.

01:01:24.349 --> 01:01:32.400
On behalf of the governing body and all the hardworking members of our Bethel families

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:40.400
and translation offices around the world, we thank you for watching the 2022 convention program.

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:46.400
We have deep appreciation and affection for each one of you.

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:53.400
And it is our prayer that Jehovah continue to bless you with peace.

01:01:54.400 --> 01:02:01.400
Let's conclude by singing a song that reflects the complete peace that Jehovah will soon bring about.

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:09.400
Please join in singing the original song, Peace at last, which we heard during the concluding talk.

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:15.400
After the song, you may have your concluding prayer at your individual locations.

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:22.400
Now we invite all to sing out along with the Watchtower course, Peace at last.

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:51.929
Peace, God's people are live with our eyes of faith.

01:02:51.929 --> 01:03:00.929
We see beyond the clouds and know that the storm soon will cease.

01:03:00.929 --> 01:03:12.099
To the ends of the earth, there may peace and life eternity.

01:03:12.099 --> 01:03:46.170
From the to the mountains past, all will be won on earth and in heaven above.

01:03:46.170 --> 01:04:52.599
And the peace will know before by just this endless ends of the times of them for all.
