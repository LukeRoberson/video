00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:09.009
Now, if we're going to be successful in not letting Satan or his world mold our thinking,

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:13.810
we have to avoid inhaling the spirit of the world.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:21.929
So let's discuss the theme, avoid inhaling the toxic spirit of this world.

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:29.649
Just as Jehovah God and Satan the devil are diametrically opposed, totally opposite,

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:34.289
holy spirit and the spirit of the world are totally opposite.

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:43.130
But interestingly, both of these are invisible active forces that motivate people to act

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.130
a certain way.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.829
Now, on the one hand, the Holy Spirit motivates them to act the way Jehovah wants them to

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.250
act, to produce the fruitage of the Holy Spirit.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.049
Love, joy, peace, patience, and so forth.

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:03.850
On the other hand, the spirit of the world motivates people to act like Satan wants them

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:12.209
to act, to produce the works of the flesh, sexual immorality, uncleanness, brazen conduct,

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:13.730
and so forth.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:20.370
But it's also interesting that both of these invisible active forces can be likened to

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.170
air that can be inhaled.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.049
Now regarding the Holy Spirit, here's what the Insight book says regarding how Jehovah

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:38.489
inspired the Bible writers, the expression inspired of God at 2 Timothy 316 is translated

00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:47.370
from a Greek phrase meaning God breathed by breathing on fateful men, God caused the

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.890
spirit to become operative upon them.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.489
While figuratively speaking, the Holy Spirit can be likened to air that is breathed by

00:01:57.489 --> 00:02:02.810
Jehovah, inhaled by people that love him.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.090
But now, what about the spirit of the world?

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.609
How is it that it can be likened to air?

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:15.129
We'll open up to Ephesians, please, chapter 2, and notice what is stated here in verse

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.569
number 2.

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.810
Our exorcist read 1 and 2, and here Paul is talking to ones who had come out of Satan's

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:23.810
world.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.969
Furthermore, God made you alive, though you were dead in your trespasses and sins, in

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:36.729
which you at one time walked according to the system of things of this world.

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:47.090
Now notice, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, the spirit that is now

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.289
at work in the sons of disobedience.

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:52.289
So notice this expression, air.

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:53.289
What is this air?

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:57.849
Well, I've been explained in our publications, it's the very same thing, as mentioned in

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:03.210
1 Corinthians chapter 2, verse 12, is the spirit of the world.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.729
Who is the source of this spirit of the world?

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:07.729
And who controls it?

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:12.490
Well, obviously we read there, the ruler of it, Satan the devil.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.610
How does it make people at?

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.650
It makes them sons of disobedience.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.250
They become very disobedient to Jehovah.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.090
But figuratively speaking, the spirit of the world can be likened to air that is breathed

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.729
from Satan and inhaled by people of this world.

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:37.889
But how different, how opposite the composition of these two airs.

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:45.569
Now one of them is fresh, clean, unpolluted life-giving, the other poisonous, toxic,

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.129
venomous, deadly.

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:55.490
In fact, we could liken the Holy Spirit to pure wholesome oxygen, whereas the spirit of

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.210
the world could be likened to deadly carbon monoxide.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.650
In fact, let's pursue this illustration a little further.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:10.449
Let's talk about some similarities between the spirit of the world and carbon monoxide.

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:13.370
Now here's one similarity.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.009
It relates to toxicity.

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:25.209
Carbon monoxide is extremely poisonous gas, is a poisonous gas present in exhaust of

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.769
internal combustion engines and furnaces.

00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:35.970
Well we mentioned before, the spirit of the world is a poisonous air, exhale from Satan.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.569
Here's another similarity.

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:42.850
This relates to the insidiousness or the sneakyness of them.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.370
Carbon monoxide is colorless, odorless, tasteless.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.209
Therefore people breathing it, usually fall asleep without even realizing they're being

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:54.209
poisoned.

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:56.490
Well what about spirit of the world?

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.649
It can't be seen smelled or tasted with the literal senses.

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:10.449
Thus the poisoning can be gradual, insidious, again with a victim not even being aware of

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:12.250
what is happening.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.329
Well let's get a third similarity.

00:05:14.329 --> 00:05:19.529
This relates to modus operandi or method of killing.

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:26.569
Carbon monoxide kills a person by attaching itself to the hemoglobin of the blood.

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:32.610
Now as you know the hemoglobin is responsible to transport oxygen through the body.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:39.170
But little by little the carbon monoxide pushes out the oxygen, attaches itself to the hemoglobin,

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:45.850
thus reducing the ability of the hemoglobin to transport oxygen to the heart and to other

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.410
parts of the body.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.370
And of course without oxygen soon a person dies.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.769
Well what about spirit of the world poisoning?

00:05:54.769 --> 00:06:02.170
Little by little it can cause a person to act in a way that pushes out, greased Jehovah's

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.370
oxygen like holy spirit.

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:10.769
And finally this can result in spiritual asphyxiation and death.

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:13.449
Well let's get a fourth similarity.

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:16.050
This relates to symptoms.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:22.290
Symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning include headache, weakness, dizziness, nausea,

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:26.170
fainting, weak pulse, and finally coma.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.250
What about symptoms of spirit of the world poisoning?

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:34.730
Well advanced symptoms we mentioned before are shocking works of the flesh.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.410
But what about earlier symptoms?

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.009
Earlier manifestations.

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:43.610
Well it's interesting in the reasoning book there's quite a list of some of these symptoms.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:49.410
But here's just for an example, here are three, manifesting a rebellious attitude toward

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:59.329
authority, allowing one's life to be dominated by the desire to possess what one sees.

00:06:59.329 --> 00:07:03.529
Showing off one's possessions and supposed attainments.

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:09.569
Well let's get one more similarity and this relates to treatment.

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:18.490
For carbon monoxide poisoning includes administration of oxygen sometimes under high pressure.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:24.810
The Mayo Clinic website describes how a person in the emergency room will breathe pure

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:29.810
oxygen by means of a mask that is placed over their nose and mouth.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:34.769
And if they can't breathe on their own, a ventilator will breathe for them.

00:07:34.769 --> 00:07:41.449
But also quite often it explains the person needs hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:47.329
That's where they're put in a chamber where they breathe pure oxygen but it's under pressure

00:07:47.329 --> 00:07:50.209
two or three times greater than normal.

00:07:50.209 --> 00:07:55.329
And that speeds up the replacement of the carbon monoxide with the oxygen.

00:07:55.329 --> 00:07:59.569
Well what about treatment for spirit of the world poisoning?

00:07:59.569 --> 00:08:04.730
Again, oxygen therapy is needed.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:10.009
We're doubling of one's efforts to receive more oxygen like Holy Spirit.

00:08:10.009 --> 00:08:11.170
How do we do that?

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:19.089
Well of course avoiding any conduct that would be grieving, Jova spirit, unclean entertainment,

00:08:19.089 --> 00:08:25.850
unhoath some thinking, but also vigorously pursuing conduct that would put one in line

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:33.610
to receive Holy Spirit, engaging in the ministry, praying for Holy Spirit, study and meditation

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:40.590
of God's word, associating with others who have the spirit of God resting upon them.

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:47.690
So there we have five similarities between the spirit of the world and carbon monoxide.

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:55.289
In review, they're both very toxic to they're both very insidious, very sneaky.

00:08:55.289 --> 00:09:03.490
Three, they both kill by oxygen deprivation, one literal, the other figurative oxygen.

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:07.450
Or both have early and advanced symptoms.

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:14.809
Five, they're both treated with oxygen therapy, a literal or figurative.

00:09:14.809 --> 00:09:20.929
Open up please to 1 John chapter 2 and how we long for this scripture to be fulfilled.

00:09:20.929 --> 00:09:24.850
1 John chapter 2 verse 17.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:33.330
Furthermore, the world is passing away and so is it's desire.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.529
But the one who does the will of God remains forever.

00:09:36.529 --> 00:09:42.610
So notice, not only will the world pass away, it's desire will pass away, it's collective

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:45.809
desire to be disobedient to Jova.

00:09:45.809 --> 00:09:51.210
Now why is it going to pass away because the spirit of the world will be gone and no longer

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:56.730
able to motivate that rebellious desire towards Johova.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.649
And why will the spirit of the world be gone?

00:09:59.649 --> 00:10:06.850
Because Satan the devil will no longer be able to breathe it from his death like confinement

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:08.250
in the abyss.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.169
We can say the abyss will be airtight.

00:10:11.169 --> 00:10:13.889
You'll not be able to excel it from there.

00:10:13.889 --> 00:10:22.649
And then, to Johova's praise, the only invisible active force that will permeate the earth

00:10:22.649 --> 00:10:28.409
and motivate humans will be the pure, oxygen-like Holy Spirit.

00:10:28.409 --> 00:10:35.370
But until that marvelous time may all of us do all within our power to avoid inhaling

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:42.210
the carbon monoxide-like Satan-breathe spirit of this world.
