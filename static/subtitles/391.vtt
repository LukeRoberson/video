00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:04.849
What do you need? What do you want?

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:10.449
There's a big difference between things that are absolutely necessary and

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.929
Things that we might enjoy or things that would make our life a little more comfortable even though they're not essential

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:23.410
In 1956 a newspaper columnist made an interesting observation

00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:27.649
He estimated that a hundred years earlier in 1856

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:30.649
man basically had 72

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:41.130
Wants of which only 16 were necessities and men of that day were being urged by advertisers to buy about 200 items

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.149
But by 1956 the number of wants had grown to

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.490
474 of which 94

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:57.850
Reviewed as necessities and men were being bombarded with ads to buy about 32,000 articles

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.850
The columnist conclusion

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:03.850
man's necessities are few

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.170
His wants

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.689
Infinite

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.930
Now if he'd made the same estimates today, I'm sure the figures would be a lot higher

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:17.329
The commercial world constantly pressures us not only to buy things

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.650
But to view as necessities things that should really be classified as once

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:33.090
Seen the clear difference between our needs and our wants is a key to avoiding the snare of

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:40.609
materialism and we appreciate the frequent reminders that we receive from the faithful and discrete slave

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.090
These help us to have the proper view of

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.810
Material things for example the text today is taken from an article that had the very clear title

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.890
Seek the kingdom not things

00:01:53.689 --> 00:02:02.730
And the theme scripture was Luke 1231 where it says keep seeking his kingdom and these things will be added to you

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:08.050
It's essential that we have faith in those words

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:17.250
We fully trust that Jehovah is going to provide our physical needs as long as we put his worship first in our lives

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.689
There was a simple definition of materialism in the study article. It's found in paragraph 3

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:31.169
Now, it didn't say that materialism is having a large bank account living in a big house or driving a fancy automobile

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:36.689
Rather it said materialism is the preoccupation

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.330
With material things rather than with spiritual riches

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.530
So materialism materialism really is a condition of our mind and our heart

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:51.409
So it's good to ask ourselves

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:58.610
What am I constantly thinking about when I get together with my friends? What is the subject of our conversation?

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:04.370
As our commenters pointed out the spirit of materialism can infect anyone

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.930
Even pioneers even

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.849
Bethelites it infected Christians in the first century

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.530
Please open your Bibles through Revelation chapter 3 and

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:23.210
We'll notice here that apparently many in the congregation had become contaminated by the materialistic environment

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:31.650
In the city of Leodicea and notice the strong council that Jesus gave to those who were putting their trust in

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.250
material riches

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.770
Revelation 3 verse 17 says

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:44.449
Because you say I am rich and have acquired riches and do not need anything at all

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:52.090
But you do not know that you are miserable and pitiful and poor and blind and naked

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:59.810
Now were these Christians materially rich? Yes, but Jesus said they were in spiritual poverty

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:02.689
Did they wear fine clothing?

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.090
No doubt, but in Jesus eyes they were naked

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:14.590
So we can see that they were in a bad spiritual state

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:22.990
Was there any cure for the Leodicean spiritual sickness? Yes, look back at chapter 3 in the first part of verse 18

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:30.990
Interestingly, Jesus told them that the remedy for trusting in riches was to buy gold

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:33.629
But what kind of gold?

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.149
He said I advise you to buy from me

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:42.029
Gold refined by fire so that you may become rich

00:04:42.709 --> 00:04:44.709
Yes, spiritual riches are what?

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:49.990
Are important only spiritual treasures are lasting

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:57.870
Material possessions are merely a means to an end. We need them to keep on living and we need them to carry out our worship of Jehovah

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:00.509
So we need to ask ourselves

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.910
What are my priorities?

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.470
Where is my focus?

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.230
Sally and I found ourselves asking these questions during a recent branch visit

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:17.310
We met brothers in countries where the kingdom work is under various degrees of restriction

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:21.790
They have no witnessing cards. They can't offer literature door to door

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:27.550
In one country brothers can be arrested and fined the equivalent of six weeks wages

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.589
Just for witnessing in public

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:38.430
In some places police would confiscate your phone or your tablet if they found that it contained the JW library app

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.310
In another country when police police would find JW library on your device

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:47.949
They would just erase the app and then give the device back to the publisher

00:05:48.829 --> 00:05:51.629
But in spite of these obstacles and threats

00:05:52.430 --> 00:06:00.430
Our brothers are finding true joy in serving Jehovah and you can imagine it was inspiring to be able to work with them

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.350
During this time

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:08.110
In one country we met with circuit overseers from three different language groups. I asked them the question

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.149
What do our brothers need most?

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:14.990
In unison they immediately replied

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:17.709
Armageddon

00:06:19.709 --> 00:06:22.029
That really put things in perspective for me

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:27.069
These brothers are not preoccupied with material things

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.189
For them every day is a matter of spiritual survival

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:34.990
Stay faithful

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.509
Meet regularly

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:37.629
Preach informally

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:42.509
These are the most important things the things that really matter

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:47.790
So how fitting is the reminder at Proverbs chapter 11 verse 4 where it says

00:06:48.269 --> 00:06:50.829
Wealth will be of no benefit on the day of fury

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.149
But righteousness is what will rescue from death

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.629
Yes, we may have some possessions that we view as very valuable

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:03.470
We may treasure them maybe it's something we received as a family heirloom

00:07:04.269 --> 00:07:07.470
But we should not expect that any of our possessions

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:10.829
Regardless of how treasured or how valuable they may be

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:15.069
Will survive with us through the great tribulation

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:19.629
Please open your Bibles to Jeremiah chapter 45

00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:28.029
Go into read verse 5 in this scripture will help us to maintain the proper viewpoint of material things

00:07:28.829 --> 00:07:32.029
These are words are redirected to Jeremiah's secretary barrack

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:38.269
Jeremiah 45 verse 5 says but you are seeking great things for yourself

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:40.910
Stop seeking such things

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:47.629
For I am about to bring a calamity on all flesh declares Jehovah and wherever you may go

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.870
I will grant you your life as a spoil

00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:58.589
Whether these great things barrack was seeking were material possessions we do not know

00:07:59.629 --> 00:08:03.550
What we do know is that when the great tribulation breaks out

00:08:04.269 --> 00:08:10.670
All of us will be grateful to come out of that tribulation with our life as a spoil

00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:14.589
And whether we survive that great tribulation or not

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:19.230
Could very well depend on how we answer these two questions right now

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:22.670
What do I want?

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.670
What do I need
