00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:09.060
In our broadcast for this month, we're going to discuss the quality of patients.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.060
Think of how many situations we encounter that require patients,

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:21.059
waiting to rush our traffic, dealing with a difficult co-worker, raising a child,

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:26.059
overcoming marital problems, coping with the illness of a loved one,

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:30.059
or maybe coping with an illness of our own.

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:39.060
Clearly, all of us face situations that require us to display a measure of patients each day.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:47.060
If we don't have patients, we can become frustrated, tired, and discouraged.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:53.060
But no matter what our circumstances are, all of us can develop this quality.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.060
How do we know?

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:02.060
Because according to Galatians 5-22, patients is an aspect of the fruitage of God's spirit.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:09.060
And with its help, we can make this quality an integral part of our personality.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.060
For this to happen, let's now answer two important questions.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.060
First, how can being patient help us to express our love for Jehovah?

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.060
And second, how can being patient improve our relationship with others?

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.060
Let's start with our first question.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.060
How can being patient help us to express our love for Jehovah?

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.060
Let's consider what stated in 1 Corinthians chapter 13.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.060
This chapter gives us a description of how love manifests itself.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.060
Please follow along as I read verse 4.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.060
Love is patient and kind.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.060
Love is not jealous.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.060
It does not brag. It does not give puffed up.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.060
Of all the many qualities to stem from love, did you note which one is listed first?

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.060
Patients.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.060
It is an integral aspect of love.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.060
We need both love and patience in order to be successful and ensure we're on the right course,

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.060
which includes pleasing Jehovah.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.060
If we think of situations where a lack of patience was a factor,

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.060
we can usually identify where a lack of love was evident.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.060
Take for example, God shows in people the nation of Israel.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.060
In Psalm 106, written many years after Israel's deliverance from Egypt,

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.060
the Psalmist indicates that they continued acting with a similar disposition.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:54.060
Despite that, Jehovah extended patience to them for many years.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.060
Please follow along as I read Psalm 106, verses 7 and 8.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.060
Our forefathers in Egypt did not appreciate your wonderful works.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.060
They did not remember your abundant loyal love,

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.060
but they rebelled at the sea by the red sea.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.060
But he saved them for the sake of his name to make his mightiness known.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.060
And what was the result?

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.060
Let's read verse 13.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.060
But they quickly forgot what he did.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.060
They did not wait for his counsel.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.379
How sad.

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:39.379
The people did not wait.

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.379
They were not patient.

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:48.379
And that highlights that they did not appreciate Jehovah's patience and loyal love.

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:53.379
Love for God should have caused them to think about the consequences of their actions.

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.379
They should have remembered how Jehovah cared and provided for them.

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:02.379
That should have moved them to be patient and wait on Jehovah's direction.

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:08.379
But time and again, their actions show that they really didn't love Jehovah as they should have.

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.379
And it costs them.

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:13.379
They eventually tested Jehovah's patience to the limit.

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:18.379
And as a nation, lost his favor.

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:21.379
What can you and I learn from their example?

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:27.379
Never would we want to become independent of Jehovah trusting in our own thinking

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:32.379
and not patiently waiting for Jehovah's counsel to direct the decisions we make.

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:37.379
Think about how well we've been guided recently regarding the pandemic.

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:40.379
Natural disasters.

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:43.379
And the organizing of our ministry.

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:49.379
Even if we didn't fully understand or even fully agree with all the decisions.

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:58.379
Our love for God helped us to take the time to think about Jehovah's care for us and trust him.

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:04.379
By doing so, we learned that if we're patient and submit to Jehovah's direction,

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:10.379
we won't go off course and will benefit ourselves and others.

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:16.379
And in doing so, we ultimately express our love for Jehovah.

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:21.139
Let's now answer the second question.

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:26.139
How can being patient improve our relationship with others?

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:31.139
If we go back to 1 Corinthians 13-4, the study note states,

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:39.139
patience is a quality that Jehovah and Jesus constantly show in their dealings with humans.

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:46.139
As imitators of Jesus and Jehovah, Christians are to show patience to others.

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.139
So if Jehovah and Jesus are patient with us,

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:57.139
it would follow that we imitate their example and be patient with others.

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.139
Let's start with the greatest example, Jehovah.

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:07.139
Think about the patience he's shown in waiting to bring an end to this system.

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:11.139
Jehovah has a fixed day and hour when that will take place.

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:14.139
And he's patiently waiting until that arrives.

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:18.139
He's bound himself to his own timetable.

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:26.139
Now rest assured, Jehovah is well aware of how we feel as his servants.

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:31.139
He knows that we wish the end of this system to come as soon as possible

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:35.139
and that we long to see the fulfillment of all his promises

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:38.139
and he longs to fulfill them.

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:46.449
But he will not become impatient and act before his appointed time.

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:50.449
Why should we appreciate Jehovah's patience in that regard?

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:57.720
Please follow along as I read 2 Peter 3-15.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.720
Furthermore, consider the patience of our Lord as salvation.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:09.720
Just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote you according to the wisdom given him.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.720
Isn't that a powerful point?

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:18.720
Jehovah's patience is the means for our salvation.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.720
Think about the number of people who are learning the truth every year.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.720
Even during the pandemic, when we weren't able to engage in our typical house to house witnessing,

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:33.720
tens of thousands of individuals still got baptized worldwide.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:40.720
Perhaps some of those included your Bible students, family members, close friends,

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.720
or maybe even you yourself.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.720
And think about this.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.720
If Jehovah had impatiently brought the end of this system,

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.720
five, ten, or twenty years ago,

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.720
would you have learned the truth?

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:04.720
So we appreciate that Jehovah is still patiently waiting for his day to arrive

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:12.319
and has allowed so many to attain to repentance and develop a relationship with him.

00:08:12.319 --> 00:08:16.319
How should this affect our relationship with others?

00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:20.319
Perhaps they can help us to be more patient with a progressive Bible student

00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:23.319
who still may be struggling with a problem.

00:08:23.319 --> 00:08:28.319
Or maybe it's still difficult for some of our relatives to see us as one of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:32.320
and to adjust to our beliefs and lifestyle.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:39.320
But in imitation of Jehovah's patience, we won't give up on them.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:46.320
And of course, reflecting on Jehovah's patience should move us to continue to have a full share in the ministry,

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.320
earnestly looking for those who are rightly disposed for everlasting life

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.320
and helping them to love Jehovah and serve him.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:09:00.320
Then they too can benefit from Jehovah's patience just as we have.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:06.019
We can also learn from the example of Jesus.

00:09:06.019 --> 00:09:12.019
He demonstrated tremendous patience when his disciples were arguing among themselves as to who was the greatest.

00:09:12.019 --> 00:09:16.019
This apparently happened on a number of occasions.

00:09:16.019 --> 00:09:20.019
And no doubt is saddened Jesus to hear this.

00:09:20.019 --> 00:09:23.019
But Jesus was patient with them.

00:09:23.019 --> 00:09:26.019
He showed empathy for them.

00:09:26.019 --> 00:09:34.019
He knew how much the culture and the environment in which they had been raised affected their thinking and attitude.

00:09:34.019 --> 00:09:38.019
That knowledge caused him to react kindly.

00:09:38.019 --> 00:09:40.019
Note one beautiful example.

00:09:40.019 --> 00:09:44.019
Please read with me March 9.

00:09:44.019 --> 00:09:49.019
March 9.33.35

00:09:49.019 --> 00:09:51.019
And they came into Capernaum.

00:09:51.019 --> 00:09:57.019
Now, when he was inside the house, he put the question to them,

00:09:57.019 --> 00:10:00.019
what were you arguing about on the road?

00:10:00.019 --> 00:10:02.019
Well, we know the answer.

00:10:02.019 --> 00:10:06.019
They had been arguing about who among them was the greater.

00:10:06.019 --> 00:10:09.019
Look at verse 35.

00:10:09.019 --> 00:10:12.019
So he sat down and called the 12 and said to them,

00:10:12.019 --> 00:10:20.019
if anyone wants to be first, he must be lastable and ministerable.

00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:23.019
Did you know what Jesus did?

00:10:23.019 --> 00:10:29.019
He patiently waited for the right time to correct them kindly.

00:10:29.019 --> 00:10:32.019
He didn't make a scene on the road.

00:10:32.019 --> 00:10:33.019
Verse 33.

00:10:33.019 --> 00:10:37.019
He waited until he was inside the house.

00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:39.019
Verse 35.

00:10:39.019 --> 00:10:42.259
Sitting down.

00:10:42.259 --> 00:10:45.259
He calmed the situation.

00:10:45.259 --> 00:10:47.259
He didn't push them.

00:10:47.259 --> 00:10:54.259
Instead, he led them patiently by instruction and by example.

00:10:54.259 --> 00:10:58.259
What a great example in avoiding becoming provoked.

00:10:58.259 --> 00:11:05.259
And instead of acting immediately, waiting for the right time to address matters,

00:11:05.259 --> 00:11:10.090
even when our patients is tested.

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:14.090
What else can we take away from Jesus' example of patients?

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.090
If you're a parent,

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:19.090
can you imitate the way that Jesus dealt with his apostles?

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:24.090
It may be frustrating if your children don't respond immediately to your counsel,

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:29.090
or if they're slow in correcting their shortcomings, or perhaps you're an elder.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:35.090
And someone you're trying to help may be slow when responding to Bible-based counsel.

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:38.090
But remember Jesus' example.

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:41.090
He never gave up on his apostles.

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:46.090
He kept looking for the good, expressing confidence in them,

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:53.090
and patiently repeated lessons that they needed so that they could draw closer to Jehovah.

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:56.090
If we do the same, not giving up,

00:11:56.090 --> 00:12:01.090
our patients may eventually be rewarded as well.

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:03.090
So to review,

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:07.090
how can being patient help us to express our love for Jehovah?

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:13.090
It stops us from running ahead of Jehovah, demonstrating our loyal love for him.

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:20.090
Waiting patiently for Jehovah's direction and guidance ensures that our course is pleasing to him.

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:25.090
And second, how can being patient improve our relationship with others?

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:29.090
It helps us to avoid acting rashly,

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:36.039
and to look for the good in others, and express confidence in them.

00:12:36.039 --> 00:12:42.039
Hopefully, this discussion will help us appreciate the benefit of displaying patients in our lives.

00:12:42.039 --> 00:12:45.039
With the increasing pressures of these last days,

00:12:45.039 --> 00:12:49.039
we'll need to display patients more than ever before.

00:12:49.039 --> 00:12:55.039
Imitating the patients of Jehovah and Jesus will help us keep the right attitude.

00:12:55.039 --> 00:13:00.039
We won't become overly discouraged or overwhelmed by the present wickedness in this system,

00:13:00.039 --> 00:13:04.039
or even be impatient about when it will end.

00:13:05.039 --> 00:13:09.039
Instead, we'll stay on the right course,

00:13:09.039 --> 00:13:14.039
keeping busy, working to develop a closer relationship with Jehovah,

00:13:14.039 --> 00:13:20.039
and keeping active in our ministry, helping others to learn about Jehovah and benefit from his patients.

00:13:20.039 --> 00:13:27.039
May all of us keep working to make the quality of patients a dominant part of our personality.

00:13:27.039 --> 00:13:29.039
As we do,

00:13:29.039 --> 00:13:33.039
we will demonstrate how much we value and appreciate this wonderful quality

00:13:33.039 --> 00:13:37.039
and bring all praise and honor to Jehovah.
