00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:09.119
Isn't that so great?

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:37.140
Hey, someone's a camera.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.820
Hello, may I help you?

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.659
Good morning.

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:41.740
We're talking briefly with people about where

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.780
to find advice to live a happy life.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.500
Have you found any reliable sources of advice?

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.619
When I need advice, I usually go to my parents

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:56.020
or another white older person.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.020
That's an excellent source of advice.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.859
What do you think about this as a reliable source of advice?

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.980
Psalm 1, 1, 2, says, happy is the man who does not walk

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.299
according to the advice of the wicked,

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.019
and does not stand on the path of sinners,

00:01:15.019 --> 00:01:17.739
and does not sit in the seat of scoffers.

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:21.420
But his delight is in the law of Jehovah,

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.500
and he reads his law in an undertone day and night.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.579
What source of good advice is recommended here?

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.719
It sounds like it would be the Bible.

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:35.640
Yes, God's law.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.280
The Holy Scriptures.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.760
How do you view the Bible?

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.079
Sure.

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.079
The Scriptures are very old.

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.319
I always thought the Bible is outdated.

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:51.000
It's true that the Bible is a very old book,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.799
but those who've examined it have been surprised

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.840
at what it contains.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.079
May I show you a one-minute video that explains this?

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:01.680
Mm, okay.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:15.759
I've heard before.

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:19.599
But the big questions still remain.

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.719
Where do we come from?

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:26.900
Why do bad things happen?

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.039
Why do people die?

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:35.439
Most religious people think that God controls the world.

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:37.319
How could that be?

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.289
This world is out of control.

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:48.280
What the Bible says may surprise you.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.719
The Bible is helping millions of people around the world

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:55.560
find answers to life's big questions.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.719
Would you like to know those answers?

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:03.759
Hmm, that was interesting, but I'm busy right now.

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:05.719
We know you weren't expecting us today.

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:09.159
So next time, perhaps I can bring my wife,

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:12.599
and we can show you the Bible's answer to this question.

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.080
What effect can the love of money and possessions

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.599
have on our happiness?

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:18.960
Okay.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.400
Okay, see you then.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.759
Sure.
