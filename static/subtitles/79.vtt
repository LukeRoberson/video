00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:08.880
We'd like to welcome all of you to JW Broadcasting for February 20, 21.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:37.090
In Parts 1 and 2 of the annual meeting, we enjoyed encouraging announcements, videos, talks, and interviews.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.090
Now we'll enjoy the final part of the annual meeting.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.090
Please, pay close attention as we begin with a talk by Brother Kenneth Cook entitled,

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.820
Will you keep standing among the righteous?

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.820
We live in a time of judgment. We're not talking about flawed human judgment.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.819
We're talking about the perfect judgment that comes from the heavenly kingdom in Jesus' hands.

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:14.819
Jesus spoke of this judgment in his great prophecy about the last days found in Matthew chapter 24 and 25.

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:22.819
After outlining what we could expect to see, he provided three parables that deal with final judgment.

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:30.819
In Matthew chapter 25, the first two parables relate to the final ceiling of genuine anointed ones.

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:36.819
These parables will be fulfilled not long before the great tribulation begins.

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:42.819
Next, in the third parable, Jesus gives attention to the rest of mankind.

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:47.819
Let's read the opening four verses of what he said, starting in verse 31.

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:57.540
When the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the angels with him, then he will sit down on his glory his throne.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:07.540
All the nations will be gathered before him and he will separate people one from another just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.539
And he will put the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:16.539
Then the king will say to those on his right,

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:25.539
Come, you who have been blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the founding of the world.

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:32.539
Inherit the kingdom. In other words, paradise, the earthly realm of the kingdom.

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:40.539
When is this fulfilled? After Jesus comes in his glory, he said, and judges those then living.

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:52.539
Jesus said that this judgment would result in a figurative separating of people to his right hand and to his left hand, like separating sheep from goats.

00:02:52.539 --> 00:03:04.539
Jesus calls those at his right hand, righteous. However, he calls those separated to his left hand, cursed, and he sends them off into everlasting destruction.

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:14.539
Since the first two parables involve judgment that takes place before the Great Tribulation, what about this third parable?

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:21.539
When does Jesus start to identify the righteous sheep and the cursed goats?

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:33.539
Back in 1995, the Watchtower helped us to understand that the final judgment of the sheep and the goats will be decided when Jesus comes in his glory during the Great Tribulation.

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:44.539
Does this mean that the judgment process does not start until then? The answer is no. Why can we say this? Well, let's illustrate the point.

00:03:44.539 --> 00:04:10.539
Think about judgments delivered by a Supreme Court. When the day arrives for a judgment to be announced, does this mean that only then the court starts to consider the evidence at hand? No. By that time the court has already read briefs, they have prepared and heard oral arguments, and then they considered the legal background to the case. This may take considerable time.

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:34.540
No court opinion is considered final until it is delivered an open court or released to the public. What is the point? Well, if the Supreme Courts of Human Governments take time to hear all the facts and to weigh all the circumstances, should we be surprised that Jesus is wisely using his time now to judge people fairly?

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:53.540
By the start of the Great Tribulation, Jesus will know who is goat-like and who is sheep-like. How so? Well, consider this. To a degree even we can see where people are choosing to stand, true, the Bible foretold that this would be the case in Malachi 3.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:03.540
There we find prophetic words that point ahead to events in the first century and in modern times. Then verse 18 says that we would quote,

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:32.540
If we can see the distinction, then we can be certain that Jesus is far ahead of us. What does Jesus see? Well, we can be sure that he is carefully watching the attitudes, actions, and speech of each person. For example, he sees their response to the truth.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:57.540
Also, Jesus is observing whether individuals support his anointed brothers who will serve with him and the kingdom. At Matthew 25, 35 through 40, Jesus said that his brothers would experience many trials and he explained that those whom he judges as sheep are the ones who assist his brothers.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:04.540
He also said that he views what is done to them as being done to him.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:12.540
While Christ's brothers will undoubtedly face trials during the Great Tribulation, how are they helped now?

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:24.540
Doing good to Christ's brothers now includes working along with them as they strive to complete the preaching of the good news of the kingdom. Jesus takes note of this.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:39.540
What else does Jesus observe? At Matthew 12, 36 and 37, Jesus stated that a person's words would also be a basis for how he or she is judged.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:46.540
Let's look at what Jesus said at Matthew 12, 36 and 37.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:07:02.540
Jesus said, I tell you that men will render an account on judgment day for every unprofitable saying that they speak. For by your words you will be declared righteous and by your words you will be condemned.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:12.540
So then does Jesus hear what we say? Yes, he does, including what we have said in preaching the good news.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:22.540
Now, by using the words render an account here. Jesus was referring to what a person has said in the past.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:37.540
That thought is reinforced by the use of the past tense in Matthew 25, 34 through 40 for the sheep and 41 through 45 for the goats.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:51.540
For example, in verse 40, Jesus says to the sheep like ones, to the extent that you did it past tense to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:08:02.540
What does this tell us? It tells us that everyone who desires to be viewed as a righteous sheep must build up a good record of support for Christ's brothers now.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:10.540
A person must be sheep like one entering the great tribulation and they must remain sheep like to the very end.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:18.540
By the time the son of man comes in his glory, it will be far too late to build up such a good record with him.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:24.540
Jesus is like the king mentioned in Proverbs 20 and verse 8.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:33.539
There it says, when the king sits on the throne to judge, he sifts out all evil with his eyes.

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:45.539
In line with this, we can be certain that Jesus, our Heavenly King, is already sifting and taking note of who are goat-like in their attitudes, actions and speech.

00:08:46.539 --> 00:08:54.539
For those who continue refusing to serve Jehovah and his kingdom, their judgment will be in place as the great tribulation begins.

00:08:54.539 --> 00:09:03.539
We can say this because there are no scriptural indications of any conversions to pure worship during the great tribulation.

00:09:03.539 --> 00:09:15.539
Instead, we read at Revelation 6, 16 and 17, that those who chose not to obey the good news will at that time turn to man-made things to try to save them.

00:09:15.539 --> 00:09:23.539
They will run to things that they view as mountain-like or strong, such as their political and commercial systems.

00:09:23.539 --> 00:09:36.539
Revelation 6, 16 tells us that they will cry out to such things, saying, fall over us and hide us from the face of the ones seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb.

00:09:36.539 --> 00:09:43.539
But these human institutions will have no power to save them. What will this mean for such ones?

00:09:44.539 --> 00:09:53.539
Many goat-like ones will perish early in the great tribulation when the governments of this world turn on and destroy false religion.

00:09:53.539 --> 00:10:05.539
Many more will perish at the hands of other goat-like people. Ezekiel 3821 prophetically states that every man's sword will be against his own brother.

00:10:05.539 --> 00:10:12.539
Finally, all remaining goat-like ones will perish by means of the angelic forces at Armageddon.

00:10:13.539 --> 00:10:28.539
But ask for the sheep-like ones. The fine shepherd Jesus will know each one of them before the start of the great tribulation, and he will observe their loyalty to Jehovah throughout the great tribulation.

00:10:28.539 --> 00:10:41.539
Then, just before Armageddon begins, Jesus will in effect sit down as judge to make the final distinction between the sheep and the goats out of all people then living.

00:10:42.539 --> 00:10:56.539
Notably, in this third parable, Jesus said that those who are at that time judged as goats will call him Lord, but Jesus will make it clear that they did not support his brothers.

00:10:56.539 --> 00:11:08.539
So then, any persons who were once sheep-like, but who failed to endure to the end by courageously supporting Christ's brothers, will be placed among the goats.

00:11:09.539 --> 00:11:20.539
Referring to Jesus as Lord will not save them. It will be too late to do good for Christ's brothers, who will likely be with Jesus in the heavenly kingdom by that time.

00:11:20.539 --> 00:11:27.539
Of course, the goats will also include those enemies of God who are still alive out of all the nations.

00:11:27.539 --> 00:11:32.539
This final judging serves an important purpose. What is it?

00:11:32.539 --> 00:11:42.539
It will leave no doubt in the eyes of all then living as to who Jesus righteous sheep are as they prepare to enter the new world.

00:11:42.539 --> 00:11:49.539
So then strive to keep standing among the righteous, who will be placed at Jesus right hand.

00:11:49.539 --> 00:12:00.539
God's word promises that as long as sheep-like ones remain loyal to Him and to His appointed King Jesus, they will be guided into everlasting life.

00:12:00.539 --> 00:12:09.539
Such ones must display courage by supporting the work of Christ's brothers, both now and during the great tribulation.

00:12:09.539 --> 00:12:16.539
What kind of courage will be needed? Courage, like that of Anna Ciferus.

00:12:16.539 --> 00:12:28.539
The Apostle Paul mentions this faithful Christian at 2 Timothy 1, 16-18. We invite you to read what he said about him, starting in verse 16.

00:12:28.539 --> 00:12:39.539
May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Anna Ciferus, for he often refreshed me, and he did not become ashamed of my prison chains.

00:12:39.539 --> 00:12:51.539
On the contrary, when he was in Rome, he diligently looked for me and found me. May the Lord grant him to find mercy from Jehovah in that day.

00:12:51.539 --> 00:13:00.539
Anna Ciferus would have been an anointed Christian, but his example is one for every Christian to imitate.

00:13:00.539 --> 00:13:11.539
Just visiting Paul could have cost Anna Ciferus his freedom or his life, but that did not stop him from finding Paul and refreshing him, did it.

00:13:11.539 --> 00:13:19.539
Qualities such as Anna Ciferus-like courage will be required of all sheep-like ones during the great tribulation.

00:13:19.539 --> 00:13:27.539
So in summary, Jesus is now observing the actions, attitudes, and speech of all people.

00:13:27.539 --> 00:13:35.539
As a thorough judge, he will have identified sheep-like ones and goat-like ones by the start of the great tribulation.

00:13:35.539 --> 00:13:50.539
Then, according to Jesus' parable, just before Armageddon begins, Jesus will pass final judgment on all then living on earth, giving attention to why the righteous sheep are placed at his right hand.

00:13:50.539 --> 00:13:54.539
Will you be found standing among the righteous?

00:13:54.539 --> 00:14:00.539
To receive that blessing, don't be swayed by the things you see taking place around you in this world.

00:14:01.539 --> 00:14:04.539
Don't be swayed by popular protests.

00:14:04.539 --> 00:14:07.539
Remain neutral. No part of it.

00:14:07.539 --> 00:14:10.539
Don't be swayed by political promises.

00:14:10.539 --> 00:14:13.539
Remain neutral. No part of it.

00:14:13.539 --> 00:14:17.539
Don't be swayed as governments say peace and security.

00:14:17.539 --> 00:14:20.539
Remain neutral. No part of it.

00:14:20.539 --> 00:14:27.539
But when it comes to obeying God's laws, stand firmly on the side of the kingdom.

00:14:27.539 --> 00:14:39.539
Only those who remain no part of the world will be viewed by Jesus as being sheep-like when the great tribulation begins, and when it wraps up at Armageddon.

00:14:39.539 --> 00:14:50.539
And only those who continue to support Jesus' brothers will be placed at Jesus' right hand when he makes the final judgment of the righteous sheep and the cursed goats.

00:14:50.539 --> 00:14:55.539
Show where you desire to stand in all that you say and do right now.

00:14:55.539 --> 00:15:09.539
And during the time yet remaining, get ready to use our new publication, Enjoy Life Forever, and help many more take a righteous stand before the end comes.

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:25.370
Thank you, Brother Cook, for making clear that what a person does now to support Jehovah's Arrangement is crucial in Christ's final judgment of the sheep and goats just before Armageddon.

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:32.370
May all of us choose to support true worship now and on through the great tribulation yet to come.

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:40.350
Now we are happy to share with you a video about an upcoming video series.

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:47.350
For the Stephen Ladd is the host of this presentation, you will be delighted with what he has to say.

00:15:47.350 --> 00:16:04.700
Jesus said, as recorded at Matthew 1127, no one fully knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son is willing to reveal Him.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:13.700
This teaches us two things. First, that it is possible for us to know the Father fully.

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:19.700
And second, that Jesus is the key to knowing Jehovah.

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:25.700
Jesus clearly identified his role in revealing the Father.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:33.700
On his last night here on Earth, he told his apostles as recorded at John 146,

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:44.700
I am the way and the truth and the life, no one comes to the Father except through me.

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:52.700
Only through Jesus can we truly know the Father and have an approved relationship with Him.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:17:05.700
Earlier at the Transfiguration, Jehovah confirmed Jesus' pivotal role when he instructed Peter James and John to listen to Jesus.

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:20.700
For over a century, the fateful and discreet slave has provided a wide range of study aids to help us learn about the life, ministry, and teachings of Jesus Christ.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:46.980
These gifts enrich our study of God's Word. They shed light on the world He lived in, the places He walked, the towns where He preached, the landscapes He saw, the food He ate, and even the seasons in which various events took place.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:18:00.980
These printed publications are more than just words on a page. They illuminate Jesus' personality and reveal His qualities which mirror those of His Heavenly Father.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:13.980
We learn about Jesus' compassion, self-sacrifice, humility, power, boldness, courage, and love.

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:22.980
More importantly, focusing on Jesus' teachings and example draws closer to the one who sent Him.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:30.980
Our meetings, assemblies, and conventions also deepen our love and appreciation for God's Son.

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:41.980
In more recent years, Jehovah's Organization has used video to reach the hearts of all those attending our conventions.

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:55.980
But how can we continue to help honest-hearted ones to understand Jesus' role as King and High Priest and to help them acquire the mind of Christ?

00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:06.980
Well, bringing events of Jesus' ministry to life on screen or the printed page is not without its challenges.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:18.319
As you know, the governing body had those full-cost and dramas for years at conventions that never was Jesus depicted.

00:19:18.319 --> 00:19:22.319
And you can understand the challenge who's going to play Jesus.

00:19:22.319 --> 00:19:35.319
Can you imagine trying to select brothers in, say, 200, 300, even more different places to play the role of Jesus Christ?

00:19:35.319 --> 00:19:40.319
But then finally, for a certainty, he made him Lord and Christ, part one, part two.

00:19:40.319 --> 00:19:46.319
We went ahead, governing body, proved it, go ahead, let's have that, and it worked very well.

00:19:46.319 --> 00:20:02.319
When you see Jesus with the woman that had a flow of blood and the tenderness in our video of Jesus dealing with that woman and her fear and yet her confidence that she could be healed by Him and the way Jesus treated her,

00:20:02.319 --> 00:20:07.319
that conveyed something that we would not always bring up in our imagination.

00:20:07.319 --> 00:20:19.319
So once we saw the reaction from the brothers and sisters, how their hearts were touched by this presentation, we could see this is a very effective way to portray Jesus' teachings.

00:20:19.319 --> 00:20:26.319
What could boost your spirituality more than actually seeing the scriptures come alive?

00:20:26.319 --> 00:20:31.319
But now, here is a very exciting announcement.

00:20:31.319 --> 00:20:43.319
The governing body is pleased to announce that a very special video series about Jesus is currently being developed.

00:20:43.319 --> 00:20:52.319
Work is underway to develop and produce a new live action dramatic series on Jesus Christ.

00:20:52.319 --> 00:20:59.319
The title of the series is The Good News According to Jesus.

00:20:59.319 --> 00:21:18.319
This series will combine the strengths of all our preceding research and study tools with the power of the moving image and will enable the viewer to gain an even deeper understanding of Jesus' life and ministry,

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:24.319
which in turn increases our knowledge of Jehovah.

00:21:24.319 --> 00:21:36.319
Although other religious and commercial institutions have produced various films on the life of Jesus, these have often been tainted by unscriptural views of Jesus,

00:21:36.319 --> 00:21:54.319
or they have placed excessive emphasis on violence and existing video productions focus on one Bible book at a time or only on specific episodes of Jesus' ministry on earth.

00:21:54.319 --> 00:22:13.319
The Good News According to Jesus, however, will show all the events of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John in the order in which they happened, and in as much of the rich detail as current research and Bible understanding will allow.

00:22:13.319 --> 00:22:22.319
Often a presentation like the one you're about to see is shown after a feature linked drama is released.

00:22:22.319 --> 00:22:32.319
Such behind the scenes videos help us to understand and appreciate various facets of the video making process.

00:22:32.319 --> 00:22:44.319
Today, however, we are giving you a preview of first look at an upcoming convention project that will take years to complete.

00:22:44.319 --> 00:23:00.319
In view of the large scope of this project, we encourage you to make it a matter of earnest prayer to Jehovah and please support it according to your circumstances.

00:23:00.319 --> 00:23:15.980
Would you like to see what episode one might look like? To provide an advanced impression of the look and feel of an episode, audio video services prepare storyboards.

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:23.980
We're pleased to share with you now an excerpt from an animated storyboard.

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:54.470
Assuming that he was in the group traveling together, they went to day's journey and then began to search for him among the relatives and acquaintances, but not finding him.

00:23:54.470 --> 00:24:34.230
They returned to Jerusalem and made a diligent search for him. Well, after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers and listening to them, and asking them questions.

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:46.990
But all those listening to him were in constant amazement at his understanding and his answers. Now when his parents saw him, they were astounded.

00:24:46.990 --> 00:25:03.349
Child, why did you treat us this way? Here your father and I have been frantically looking for you.

00:25:03.349 --> 00:25:10.349
Why were you looking for me? Did you not know that I must be in the house of my father?

00:25:11.349 --> 00:25:21.349
However, they did not understand what he was saying to them. Then he went down with them and returned to Nazareth, and he continued subject to them.

00:25:21.349 --> 00:25:46.259
Also, his mother carefully kept all these sayings in her heart, and Jesus went on progressing in wisdom and in physical growth and in favor with God and men.

00:25:46.259 --> 00:25:56.519
The true light that gives light to every sort of man was about to come into the world.

00:25:56.519 --> 00:26:07.519
Of course, this is not the final video. Rather, it's an example of how the words on a page can come to life.

00:26:07.519 --> 00:26:18.519
Preparing simple basic drawings to convey the idea of a video is one of the early visual tools used during the approval process.

00:26:18.519 --> 00:26:30.519
The animatic review is a very early milestone for the visual storytelling. But how has the project been developed?

00:26:30.519 --> 00:26:38.519
What direction has the governing body given for bringing events in Jesus' life to the screen?

00:26:38.519 --> 00:26:45.519
So first of all, the governing body approved the concept of producing a production like this.

00:26:45.519 --> 00:26:49.519
But there were some questions. How do you do it?

00:26:49.519 --> 00:26:52.519
So three options were given to the governing body.

00:26:52.519 --> 00:27:00.519
The first option was for us just to have a theatrical stage production, similar to what we'd already done.

00:27:00.519 --> 00:27:10.519
The second set of options involved having a narrator speak and just read the sections of Scripture

00:27:10.519 --> 00:27:19.519
and in the background to have acting but not actually to have Jesus speaking or those involved with Jesus speaking.

00:27:19.519 --> 00:27:29.519
And then finally, the third option which is of course the hardest and involves a lot of work is to do a real life drama.

00:27:29.519 --> 00:27:37.519
So we were interested to see how the governing body would feel about this and what a joyous time it was to see the brothers say,

00:27:37.519 --> 00:27:45.519
we want the best for the brotherhood. We want them to be able to see the power and impact of what Jesus taught.

00:27:45.519 --> 00:27:51.519
Yes, we want the third option. So then we realized there's a lot of work ahead.

00:27:51.519 --> 00:27:57.519
It's easy to think. The inspired text is there, what's to write.

00:27:57.519 --> 00:28:07.519
But it's not as simple as just taking a little half hour chunks out of the four gospel accounts and throwing them on script and filming them.

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:12.519
Which gospel account do you use? Do you use Matthew's account? Mark's looks.

00:28:12.519 --> 00:28:26.519
So very quickly we saw the need to lay each of the four gospel accounts side by side and decide which account in every case, every event gives us the fullest picture.

00:28:26.519 --> 00:28:35.519
The most details. So even if you can't say everything that appears in all four accounts, you use the one to carry the bulk of the story.

00:28:35.519 --> 00:28:39.519
The others provide the rest of the details that we'll actually see.

00:28:39.519 --> 00:28:45.519
The brothers who help write the dramas, they have a tremendous amount of work to do.

00:28:45.519 --> 00:28:55.519
But then there also are those who do the research just to make sure little details are correct, whether it be the shoes a person has on or whether he even wears shoes.

00:28:55.519 --> 00:29:04.519
When you show something on film, you are committing yourself. You are saying this is the explanation.

00:29:04.519 --> 00:29:12.519
Or in some cases, the application. It goes beyond illustration. It's the explanation. It's the way to understand what happened.

00:29:12.519 --> 00:29:18.519
And that is what sticks with people's memories. So it's a huge responsibility to get that right.

00:29:18.519 --> 00:29:32.519
So our research department already has a lot of information. But doing something like this is yet another step down the path of being very, very difficult, because there are a lot more questions come up.

00:29:32.519 --> 00:29:36.519
How are we going to depict the devil? How do you show Jesus walking on water?

00:29:36.519 --> 00:29:41.519
What footwear was allowed in the soreg? And what's the soreg?

00:29:41.519 --> 00:29:56.519
The research is pivotal in this. So you make a decision about what to depict. But then there are details when it comes to not just telling it, not just reading what happened.

00:29:56.519 --> 00:30:01.519
But now that you have to show what happened, how do you do that?

00:30:01.519 --> 00:30:08.519
If you take something that's static, like a piece of artwork, that's well researched, solid sources, and now you bring it to life.

00:30:08.519 --> 00:30:15.519
In many respects, more research needs to go into this so that everything is looked at from various angles.

00:30:15.519 --> 00:30:27.519
So let me explain the challenge we have with John Chapter 6. If we look at Map 3B in the Appendix section, just imagine we have the Sea of Galilee here.

00:30:27.519 --> 00:30:36.519
Now according to what it shows us, we have Magadan here on this side of the Sea of Galilee, and up here we have Capernaum.

00:30:36.519 --> 00:30:50.519
Now according to what this tells us, Jesus performed his miracle across on this side of the Sea of Galilee, and then the apostles travel by boat to this general area.

00:30:50.519 --> 00:30:53.519
Of course, Jesus joined up with him when he walked on the water.

00:30:53.519 --> 00:31:01.519
So according to John Chapter 6, Jesus starts to teach the crowd as he was walking along the Sea shore.

00:31:01.519 --> 00:31:10.519
But by the end of John Chapter 6, we see that Jesus is actually speaking of that time here in Capernaum.

00:31:10.519 --> 00:31:22.519
So the question comes up, what part of the dialogue was actually stated here in the synagogue in Capernaum, and what part was stated along the Sea shore as he is walking along?

00:31:22.519 --> 00:31:34.519
So we'll have to do some research into John Chapter 6, and see where is a good break for us to realize what words were actually said there in the synagogue. That's the challenge.

00:31:34.519 --> 00:31:49.519
We need for the friends to be able to watch this video series and feel they're actually there, and what they are seeing is as close to the way it must have been as we can possibly make it, and the role of research helps us to ensure that.

00:31:49.519 --> 00:31:59.519
With scripts being developed and approved, the production team continues work with a visual look and feel of the series.

00:31:59.519 --> 00:32:05.519
So when we found out that the project involved the entirety of Jesus' ministry, it was simply overwhelming.

00:32:05.519 --> 00:32:10.519
Once we've read our script, we go into a phase where we start working with storyboards.

00:32:10.519 --> 00:32:16.519
Storyboards are kind of like first pass at what this story might look like.

00:32:16.519 --> 00:32:21.519
That's compiled into what's called an animatic, which is a type of video.

00:32:21.519 --> 00:32:27.519
So you've got an aeration, you've got dialogue, and you've got music, but it's to these cartoon boards.

00:32:27.519 --> 00:32:34.519
It's great because it gets you prepared so that on set, the challenges don't just pop up, you can anticipate them.

00:32:34.519 --> 00:32:41.150
Concept art is a communication tool to help us to get all in the same page.

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:51.150
Concept art helps us to get the mood of it, the lighting, to experience it maybe from a perspective that we hadn't thought of it before.

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:58.150
The story of Jesus' ministry isn't just dry, cold facts. It's actually human stories.

00:32:58.150 --> 00:33:08.150
When we see how different people respond and react to Jesus' ministry, how they're shaped and molded by what the experience, that's essentially that character's arc.

00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:16.150
We go in and say, okay, where does our character start? How does he grow? And where is he by the end of this series?

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:22.150
By seeing his struggles, seeing his challenges, it makes that character more relatable.

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:30.150
As years of development passed, the immense scope of this project came into clear focus.

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:35.150
A natural question arose, where would we record it?

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:42.150
When we were doing the production of Jonah, we used parts of Southern California, and we thought that would be a very good location.

00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:56.150
So that was proposed to the governing body, and they said, thank you very much, but we would rather that you use existing Bethel facilities that would be available, and that maybe has not been utilized to its full potential.

00:33:56.150 --> 00:34:03.150
So we worked with worldwide design construction, and they provided a list of some of the branches that had space.

00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:13.150
And as we were doing so, it came to our attention that in Australasia, the printer was about to be phased out.

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:22.150
At the end of 2015, the printing work was moved to Japan. The press was then put up for sale. It sold about three years later.

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:27.150
So now we have this big warehouse space, just what we need for a studio.

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:41.150
We just were stunned to think that such a project could be accomplished here, but I think we've also seen so many evidences of Jehovah's blessing on this project that it's very clear it's something he wants.

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:49.150
The temporary accommodation here at the branch was due for demolition, and I mean like the build-ozes were almost at the gate.

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:55.150
So we were able to stop those build-ozes, and as a result we're currently renovating those residents.

00:34:55.150 --> 00:35:05.150
Jehovah's hem was definitely in that experience. Without the stopping of that demolition, we wouldn't have had enough accommodation to look after this project.

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:13.150
It was as if Jehovah was dropping this option in our laps with all the criteria that we needed to do this project.

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:22.150
With a primary location selected, production design helps take a concept and make it a reality.

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:39.150
Our goal as production design is to immerse the audience in the story. If they have that sense, now they're paying attention to what's being set on screen, what they can learn, what they can benefit from it.

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:50.150
It's one thing to design something, but then to execute that design is all another thing. Even like with the throne room, this actually is too much work. We have to simplify it.

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:58.150
Do we need to show three walls? Can we just get away with building two walls and have the same effect, the same production quality?

00:35:58.150 --> 00:36:05.150
Usually we design a set, we build a set, we fill in the set, and then we turn the set down.

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:13.150
But this project is unique and that we're not doing that. These buildings, these structures that we're going to be filming are going to last for years.

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:26.150
And so they have to be built that way. So how do we combine modern day building standards to make it last, but still make it look like an old ancient building that was built 2,000 years ago?

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:37.150
We were looking for a certain type of concrete finish. Through a website we found there was a company over in Perth that was able to achieve this.

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:47.150
And after calling them, find out their brothers. And those brothers have been able to come over and help us with their expertise to get the right type of finish.

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:54.150
The support from all those under the Australasia branch territory has been faith strengthening.

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:59.150
So one of the biggest needs we probably have at the moment would be auditioning.

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:12.150
We absolutely need more volunteers for acting. It's a unique and new form of sacred service is something that probably most never thought they would ever do or be asked to do, but there is definitely a need.

00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:19.150
The more that can make themselves available through this auditioning process allows us to have the right people and the roles.

00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:33.150
It's one fundamental principle that underlies kind of any good acting is empathy. It's something that we all learn as Christians, it's not about showing the behavior in big ways, it's about understanding who the character is, and then it kind of exudes naturally.

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:40.150
Jehovah's organization will always train us and Jehovah's spirit will make us ready for the task that's ahead of us.

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:52.150
It's simple training, but it's definitely designed to help somebody get comfortable in front of a camera, performing in front of many people, and being able to relax, being able to be themselves.

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:58.150
To say our brothers and sisters offering themselves, putting themselves out in this way is wonderful.

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:07.460
When this project was first discussed, it kind of felt like so far into the future and almost in a possibility.

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:17.460
It was so big in scope, but now it's actually happening. And you see Jehovah's blessing on the planning, on the construction, on the people.

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:27.610
Will there be challenges? Oh yeah, guaranteed, but if Jehovah wants something done, that's what happens.

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:36.610
We have things at the right time, and that's what we've done. We've advanced now to where we're able to do it in such a wonderful way for the whole world.

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:44.610
We are working with the best words that have ever been spoken on this planet, words that have power and meaning.

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:52.610
This is such a huge endeavor, and yet Jehovah has shown us his direction all along.

00:38:52.610 --> 00:39:03.610
It needs to be done with this project being blessed by Jehovah. That's what's going to happen. The genuine good news according to Jesus. That's what we're going to have.

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:13.429
It's clear that Jehovah is blessing this tremendous undertaking.

00:39:13.429 --> 00:39:28.429
The good news according to Jesus will help all of us to teach the truth about Jesus, and it will help us to deepen our own appreciation for his loving sacrifice in behalf of all mankind.

00:39:28.429 --> 00:39:44.429
Jesus said as recorded at John 14, 13, and 14, whatever you ask in my name, I will do this so that the Father may be glorified in connection with the Son.

00:39:44.429 --> 00:39:50.429
If you ask anything in my name, I will do it.

00:39:50.429 --> 00:40:07.429
Thus, our sincere prayer is that this multi-year project will be a grand success and will result in the salvation of many more true disciples to the praise of Jehovah's great name.

00:40:07.429 --> 00:40:12.429
Thank you all for your continued prayers and support.

00:40:12.429 --> 00:40:20.429
Thank you for encouraging yet others to support this project with their prayers, talents, time, and assets.

00:40:20.429 --> 00:40:27.429
Thank you to our dear brothers and sisters in Austral Asia as well for your willing spirit.

00:40:27.429 --> 00:40:35.429
All of us eagerly await what the future holds for this good work ahead of us.

00:40:36.429 --> 00:40:42.429
The prologue to the book Come Be My follower states this.

00:40:42.429 --> 00:40:48.429
Jehovah said to his only bigot son to the earth to give his life as a ransom.

00:40:48.429 --> 00:40:54.429
In addition to dying for us, that son showed us how to live.

00:40:54.429 --> 00:41:02.429
With each step he took, he kept his integrity and brought joy to his father's heart.

00:41:02.429 --> 00:41:07.429
And Jesus also showed us how to be like his father.

00:41:07.429 --> 00:41:17.349
The ways in the will of the Father found perfect expression in the words and deeds of the Son.

00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:27.349
If we want to draw closer to Jehovah and know him fully, we must continue to learn more about his son.

00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:33.349
May this new video series help us to grow in love for the Son.

00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:40.340
And our loving father, Jehovah.

00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:43.340
What an exciting announcement.

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:46.340
We love the gospel accounts.

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:49.340
We love Jesus teachings and personality.

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:55.340
And we love Jehovah who is the one that Jesus so perfectly imitated.

00:41:55.340 --> 00:42:02.340
As stated in the video, the good news according to Jesus series will take years to complete.

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:09.340
To reassure you, we do have additional Bible dramas planned for our upcoming regional conventions.

00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:21.340
However, we do not have to wait for this new video series to be fully completed before benefiting from the visual gospel accounts.

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:31.340
In future convention programs, we will see the various segments of the life of Jesus play out each year at our convention.

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:36.340
With Jehovah's guidance, we are so well fed spiritually.

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:42.739
Brother Mark Sanderson has an interesting talk to present at this time.

00:42:42.739 --> 00:42:48.539
His theme is, where is Jehovah?

00:42:48.539 --> 00:42:52.539
Jehovah is with you, you mighty warrior.

00:42:52.539 --> 00:42:58.539
With those words, Jehovah's angel greeted faithful judge Gideon.

00:42:58.539 --> 00:43:02.539
But his reply to those words might surprise you.

00:43:02.539 --> 00:43:03.539
Would you open your Bibles?

00:43:03.539 --> 00:43:07.539
Let's read together judges, chapter 6, verse 13.

00:43:07.539 --> 00:43:11.539
That's judges 6, verse 13.

00:43:11.539 --> 00:43:13.539
At this, Gideon said to him,

00:43:13.539 --> 00:43:16.539
Pardon me, my Lord.

00:43:16.539 --> 00:43:22.539
But if Jehovah is with us, why has all of this come upon us?

00:43:22.539 --> 00:43:27.539
Where are all his wonderful acts that our fathers related to us saying,

00:43:27.539 --> 00:43:31.539
Did Jehovah not bring us up out of Egypt?

00:43:31.539 --> 00:43:38.539
Now, Jehovah has deserted us and given us into Midian's hand.

00:43:38.539 --> 00:43:44.539
Well, is that how you would respond to an angel of Jehovah who is speaking to you?

00:43:44.539 --> 00:43:48.539
Well, probably not, under normal circumstances.

00:43:49.539 --> 00:43:52.539
But what about in 2020?

00:43:52.539 --> 00:43:57.539
This has truly been an incredible year.

00:43:57.539 --> 00:44:05.539
We have faced a pandemic, a pandemic that has robbed us of our dear loved ones,

00:44:05.539 --> 00:44:13.539
a pandemic that has caused us to face isolation to be separated from our relatives and close friends

00:44:13.539 --> 00:44:21.539
so that now an epidemic of anxiety has settled down across our earth.

00:44:21.539 --> 00:44:27.539
At times during this year, maybe you have felt like Gideon.

00:44:27.539 --> 00:44:30.539
Maybe his words have been your words.

00:44:30.539 --> 00:44:32.539
Well, what does that mean?

00:44:32.539 --> 00:44:35.539
If you have said those things or felt those things,

00:44:35.539 --> 00:44:38.539
does it mean that you're lacking faith?

00:44:38.539 --> 00:44:41.539
Does it mean that your love for Jehovah is disappearing?

00:44:41.539 --> 00:44:46.539
Or that now you're sort of diminishing in your relationship with God?

00:44:46.539 --> 00:44:48.539
Not at all.

00:44:48.539 --> 00:44:54.539
Gideon was not the only faithful of servant of Jehovah who expressed similar thoughts.

00:44:54.539 --> 00:44:56.539
Do you remember what Habakkuk said?

00:44:56.539 --> 00:45:05.360
Let's open our Bibles. Let's read together Habakkuk, chapter 1, and verses 2 and 3.

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:10.300
Habakkuk said,

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:15.300
How long, O Jehovah, must I cry for help?

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.300
But you do not hear.

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:20.300
How long must I ask for help from violence?

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:23.300
But you do not intervene.

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:26.300
Why do you make me witness wrongdoing?

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:29.300
And why do you tolerate oppression?

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:32.300
Why are destruction and violence before me?

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:37.300
And why do quarreling and conflict abound?

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:42.300
Why? Why? Why?

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:47.300
Well, maybe those words sound a little bit familiar to you.

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:56.300
But brothers, when we feel overwhelmed by our circumstances, by our grief, by our anxiety,

00:45:56.300 --> 00:46:00.300
there is a question that we need to ask.

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:05.300
Now, this is a question that was first recorded in the Bible

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:08.300
from the faithful prophet, Elijah.

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:10.300
Now, would you read it with me?

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:15.300
It's in 2nd Kings, chapter 2, and verse 14.

00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:20.300
2nd Kings 2, and verse 14.

00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:28.300
It's as then he, now this is Elijah, then he took the official garment of Elijah that had fallen off him

00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:31.300
and struck the waters and said,

00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:36.300
Where is Jehovah, the God of Elijah?

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:41.300
When he struck the waters, they were divided to the left and to the right

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:45.300
so that Elijah went across.

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:47.300
What is the question?

00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:50.300
Where is Jehovah?

00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:54.300
Now, what did Elijah mean when he asked that question?

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:59.300
Was he saying, Where is Jehovah? Why isn't he doing something?

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:01.300
Is that the sense of the question?

00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:03.300
Not at all.

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:06.300
Elijah was looking for Jehovah.

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:08.300
He was searching for his direction.

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:12.300
He wanted to see the hand of God.

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:15.300
Well, Elijah got the answer to his prayer.

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:21.300
Those waters opened right in front of him so that he could cross.

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:25.300
Well, this is not the only place where this question appears in the Bible.

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:27.300
Let's look at another place.

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:30.300
Here in Jeremiah, chapter 2.

00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:37.300
Jeremiah, chapter 2, and verse 5.

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:40.300
This is what Jehovah says.

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:46.300
What fault did your forefathers find in me so that they strayed so far from me

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:51.300
and they walked after worthless idols and became worthless themselves?

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:57.300
They did not ask, now notice, they did not ask, Where is Jehovah?

00:47:57.300 --> 00:48:00.300
The one who brought us out of the land of Egypt,

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:04.300
who led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and pits,

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:09.300
through a land of drought and of deep shadow, through a land where no man travels

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:14.300
and where no man humans dwell.

00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:16.300
What's the point?

00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:20.300
Jehovah wanted his people to search for him.

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:29.300
He wanted them to ask, Where is Jehovah to look for his hand to seek his help and direction?

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:35.300
Now, brothers, why is it so urgent for us during these critical times,

00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:40.300
during a pandemic to be saying, Where is Jehovah?

00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:49.300
Because we so desperately need the help, the direction, the support, the comfort

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:54.300
that come from our amazing, our wonderful God, Jehovah.

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:59.300
But now you might say, Well, is Jehovah really going to help me?

00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:01.300
Is Jehovah really going to help me?

00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:03.300
I'm not important, I'm not significant.

00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:06.300
Is Jehovah really going to be there for me?

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:13.300
Well, look at these beautiful words in the scripture in Isaiah chapter 57.

00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:20.300
Isaiah chapter 57, which is really a promise from our God, Jehovah.

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:24.300
Isaiah 57 verse 15 says,

00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:28.300
For this is what the high and lofty one says,

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:33.300
Who lives forever and whose name is holy.

00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:39.300
I reside in the high and holy place, but now notice this.

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:48.300
But also with those crushed and lowly in spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly,

00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:53.300
and to revive the heart of those being crushed.

00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:56.300
What an amazing thought.

00:49:56.300 --> 00:50:00.300
Here are our God, Jehovah, the Almighty, who dwells in the highest heavens,

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:03.300
says that when we are crushed, when we are lowly,

00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:08.300
in a figurative sense, he resides right with us.

00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:11.300
How beautiful, how amazing.

00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:14.300
Well now, what does that mean? What does that teach us?

00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:17.300
It teaches us we need to ask that question,

00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:19.300
Where is Jehovah every day?

00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:21.300
We need to beg Jehovah for his direction.

00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:24.300
We need to beg him for his help.

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:27.300
But then we need to do something more.

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:33.300
We need to be on the lookout for the hand of Jehovah.

00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:36.300
When Elijah felt completely isolated,

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:39.300
when he was so discouraged, do you remember?

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:42.300
He said, I am the only one left.

00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:45.300
He just poured his heart out to Jehovah.

00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:47.300
And what did Jehovah do for him?

00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:54.300
Well, you'll remember, Jehovah allowed Elijah to see a miraculous display of his power.

00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:57.300
Remember, he saw, he felt that wind.

00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:59.300
He felt the earthquake.

00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:02.300
He felt the fire.

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:06.300
But you know, the Bible says, Jehovah was not in the wind.

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:08.300
Jehovah was not in the earthquake.

00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:12.300
Jehovah was not in the fire.

00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:14.300
But then what came next?

00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:19.300
A calm, low voice.

00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:23.300
That was Jehovah.

00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:26.300
Now, what do we learn from that experience?

00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:34.300
Sometimes, brothers, we might be waiting for some big, bold, dramatic expression of Jehovah's hand.

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:37.300
But in reality, what do we need to do?

00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:48.300
We need to turn up our spiritual hearing aids so that we can hear the calm, low voice of Jehovah.

00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:54.300
You see, Jehovah's answer to our prayers might come in a way that we don't expect.

00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:59.300
Maybe it's through the kind gesture or act of one of our brothers or sisters.

00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:09.300
Maybe it's through a text message, an email, a phone call, or some other way that our brother or sister acts to show their kindness.

00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:14.300
Maybe that's Jehovah's way of giving us the help that we need.

00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:28.300
That means that when we are earnestly praying, when we're earnestly seeking Jehovah's help, be attentive, be alert, ask, where is Jehovah and look for his hand?

00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:32.300
But now here's another question, brothers.

00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:41.300
When that help comes, when Jehovah does provide that assistance that you need, will you be willing to accept it?

00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:46.300
When Mary came to Jesus with a perfumed oil, genuine art.

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:53.300
Remember so expensive that it would cost a year's wages for an average laborer.

00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:57.300
It would have been so easy for Jesus to turn her away.

00:52:57.300 --> 00:53:01.300
Just say, oh no, Mary, thank you very much, but I don't need you.

00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:07.300
A Jehovah's going to help me, so you can just go now and I'll be fine.

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:09.300
Jesus didn't do that.

00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:13.300
Jesus willingly accepted the help.

00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:22.300
Now maybe, maybe Jesus understood that Jehovah had put it into Mary's heart to do this so that his body would be properly prepared for burial.

00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:23.300
We don't know.

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:30.300
But the point is, Jesus accepted the help that Mary provided.

00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:36.300
Well, brothers and sisters, what's the lesson? What do we need to learn from this?

00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:42.300
If you're a person who always says, oh no, we're fine. We don't need anything.

00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:47.300
Jehovah's going to help us, or oh no, you don't need to tell me that.

00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:51.300
I already know. Jehovah will give me the direction I need.

00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:54.300
Well, then we may be missing out.

00:53:54.300 --> 00:54:01.300
We may not be seeing or hearing the help that Jehovah wants to give us.

00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:10.300
Let's watch a video and see how our brothers and sisters in distress have experienced the help of Jehovah at a critical time.

00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:15.510
I thought that fire was loud.

00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:20.510
I thought that you could hear a wildfire, and it was just dead quiet.

00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:29.860
By the time we went down the driveway and around the corner, we stopped and looked back, and back to my parents' houses on fire.

00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:33.860
But when the pandemic hit, we lost our work.

00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:38.860
We couldn't go to work, and we also couldn't leave our apartment.

00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:40.860
The situation was very hard.

00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:47.460
My husband, Ivan, was charged with organizing extremist activity.

00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:52.460
He was put into pretrial detention for four months.

00:54:52.460 --> 00:55:01.769
I found out that I had a tomb in my chest, and I would have to have a very serious operation.

00:55:01.769 --> 00:55:04.769
I lost my mom to the coronavirus.

00:55:04.769 --> 00:55:11.769
Living 3,000 miles apart, there would be a long time before I would be able to go home at all, and I wasn't able to be there when it happened.

00:55:11.769 --> 00:55:23.219
Earlier this year, my son Nathan died in a tragic accident. He was two years old.

00:55:23.219 --> 00:55:28.219
At that time, I asked Jehovah the question, why is this happening to me?

00:55:28.219 --> 00:55:34.079
There was friends there before we got there.

00:55:35.079 --> 00:55:42.079
Before we got to the place we knew we were going to evacuate, because they asked where it was going to be.

00:55:42.079 --> 00:55:51.079
Willing to just provide anything that we needed before we even knew what it was that we needed, and especially spiritually.

00:55:51.079 --> 00:55:59.099
Even when I didn't know, we needed to say a prayer. It was there.

00:55:59.099 --> 00:56:03.099
In those moments, we saw Jehovah's hand.

00:56:03.099 --> 00:56:06.099
Brothers would come by and give us food.

00:56:06.099 --> 00:56:13.760
There was even a brother that called me when things started to go bad and said,

00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:15.760
I think you're going to need some money.

00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:24.309
And without saying anything, he came and left an envelope outside our apartment.

00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:37.440
When we opened the envelope, we saw that there was exactly the amount we needed to pay the bills and to buy things that we needed for the apartment.

00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:45.440
I have only learned about brotherly love, but during that time, I really understood what it truly means.

00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:50.440
During that time, brothers who we did not even know called us.

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:54.440
They spent time with us. They prayed with us.

00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:58.440
They spent a lot of their time encouraging us.

00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:03.440
During that time, I saw evidence of Jehovah's hand in our lives.

00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:09.440
I was really, really struggling one day, and I had to shout to Jehovah in prayer.

00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:15.440
I was trying to throw all my burdens on him, and not two minutes after I finished that prayer,

00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:21.440
is when an elder reached out to me and gave me the best shepherding call I think I've ever had in my life.

00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:29.440
And clearly, that was Jehovah reaching out to me and trying to show me that he understood how I felt and was there for me.

00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:37.440
After intensive care, I felt that I needed someone to hold my hand, so I understood that Jehovah would take me by the hand.

00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:47.440
A sister visited me every day, helped me get dressed, she brushed my hair, and we went for short walks along the corridor.

00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:56.440
Now I can really see how compassionate and considerate Jehovah is, that he knows how to support us, he knows us inside and out.

00:57:56.440 --> 00:58:03.440
While we were going through this difficult time, Jehovah helped us so much, and we definitely saw his hand in our lives.

00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:10.440
And in the future, if any difficulty should occur, we are confident that Jehovah will help us and protect us.

00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:18.440
It doesn't matter what we face, it'll get worse and worse in this system, but we know that Jehovah can get us through absolutely anything.

00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:32.809
I've seen the overwhelming evidence in my own life, I've seen it for others too, and whatever Satan throws at us, it doesn't matter because Jehovah is stronger, he's the most powerful ally that we can have.

00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:45.809
At this annual meeting, we have heard so much about what the governing body under the direction of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus are doing to strengthen Jehovah's people worldwide.

00:58:45.809 --> 00:58:54.809
But brothers and sisters, do you know one thing that is strengthening the governing body to continue on in our work?

00:58:54.809 --> 00:59:01.809
It's you, it's every one of you brothers and sisters out in the field.

00:59:01.809 --> 00:59:11.809
We know what you're going through, we read your cards and letters, we hear your expressions, we know you're suffering through a difficult time.

00:59:11.809 --> 00:59:19.809
And yet you keep going, you keep enduring, you keep serving Jehovah faithfully.

00:59:19.809 --> 00:59:26.809
That not only warms our hearts, but it strengthens our own faith to continue serving Jehovah.

00:59:26.809 --> 00:59:37.150
We are facing a challenging time now, and as we face the Great Tribulation, we will face even greater challenges.

00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:46.150
We may have times of discouragement, just like Gideon had, just like Habakkuk had, just as Elijah had.

00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:54.150
But we will also prove faithful to the end, just as each of those men did, if we do what?

00:59:54.150 --> 01:00:05.150
If we keep looking for Jehovah, if we keep searching for his hand, if we keep turning up our spiritual hearing aids

01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:13.150
so that we can be attentive to the ways that Jehovah will use to help us and to strengthen us and direct us.

01:00:13.150 --> 01:00:20.150
Yes, dear brothers and sisters, keep on asking, where is Jehovah?

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:25.039
That was up building.

01:00:25.039 --> 01:00:32.039
What a blessing to have now enjoyed the entire annual meeting program.

01:00:32.039 --> 01:00:40.039
We hope that it will help you to continue preaching about Jehovah and his kingdom with renewed zeal.

01:00:40.039 --> 01:00:46.039
It's true that this world seems to be in more turmoil than ever before.

01:00:46.039 --> 01:00:56.510
But it's clear that Jehovah's Holy Spirit is guiding us during these troublesome times.

01:00:56.510 --> 01:01:09.510
We'll conclude this month's program with our video postcard, which comes to us from the Solomon Islands, where my wife and I enjoyed the privilege of serving a convention a number of years ago.

01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:21.510
Located northeast of Australia in the Pacific Ocean, the Solomon Islands comprised six main islands and almost 1,000 smaller islands atolls and reefs.

01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:33.510
This archipelago was the site of intense warfare during World War II, and remnants of that war still litter beaches in the water just offshore.

01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:43.510
The official language of the country is English, however, most residents speak Melanesian Pigeon and other indigenous languages.

01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:49.510
Our publications and videos are being translated into 10 of those languages.

01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:59.510
In the Solomon Islands, you'll find tree-filled mountainous terrain, beautiful beaches, volcanoes, and even volcanic steam vents on the island of Symbol.

01:01:59.510 --> 01:02:08.510
But this breathtaking beauty comes with inherent challenges caused by nature, such as frequent cyclones and earthquakes.

01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:22.510
The majority of the people in the Solomon Islands live in rural areas, while about 20% of the population resides in urban areas, including the capital city of Honyad, where our branch office is located.

01:02:22.510 --> 01:02:27.510
And Honyadar brothers covered the territory with the good news just as you do.

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:41.510
However, at the time this video postcard was recorded, the brothers in Honyadar and the more than 2,000 publishers in the Solomon Islands had to adjust their preaching methods because of the worldwide pandemic.

01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:47.510
Like many of us, they quickly found alternative ways to accomplish their ministry.

01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:58.510
For example, although many publishers in the Honyadar Qualcomm congregation do not own personal cellophones, they found ways to make phone calls.

01:02:58.510 --> 01:03:08.510
At times, even before our brothers could call a return visit, the householder was already calling them to ask more questions about the Bible.

01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:18.510
The 105 publishers of the Honyadar Qualcomm congregation were happy to have a total of 490 attend the memorial in 2020.

01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:30.510
And now they send you their warm love and greetings. From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
