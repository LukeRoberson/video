00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:09.259
I, as a teacher, can't allow this decision.

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:11.259
What do you want to do?

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:16.260
These hundreds of Russian citizens, extremists,

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.260
are against our Constitution.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:27.260
Do you think that this is all, that extremism and so on?

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.259
But extremism, as they explain, is the light of the ego,

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:39.259
that they think their faith is true.

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:44.259
But forgive me, what faith is the light of their faith?

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:51.259
The light of the ego, the church in which many countries have their share,

00:00:51.259 --> 00:01:00.259
and the whole freedom of speech is nowhere to be considered extremist.

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:09.260
And we have the light of the ego, as the light of their faith.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.260
They are very primitive citizens,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:21.260
working honorably, working with their family, with their children.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:29.260
And we have already made such an assumption that not only those in the light of the ego,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:36.260
who lived in the Soviet times, were sitting in the holes.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:43.260
Well, the Russian citizens, the prime citizens, I once again say,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.260
are working honest and honest, who now have,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
too, let's go to Bulgaria.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.260
This will be a big challenge, a challenge against their citizens

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.260
and a challenge of international level.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.260
This is a very simple mistake,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:10.259
and I think that the performance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
