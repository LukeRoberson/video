00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:10.910
Jehovah has always given us the right tool at the right time to teach others.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:19.460
And this new book is no exception.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.699
How is this book organized?

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.859
Each lesson is divided into three parts.

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.300
How do you use it to conduct a Bible study?

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.700
You might encourage your student to read the first part of a lesson in advance and to

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.820
note the questions in bold and the key scriptures.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.740
Begin each study by reading and discussing the first part together.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.380
Next, consider together the dig deeper section.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:56.060
Begin by reading the introductory statement, which explains what follows and take note

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.219
of the subheadings that outline the main points.

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.659
Read the scriptures.

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:05.780
Watch the provided videos together.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.219
And then discuss how the scriptures and videos answer the related questions.

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:15.819
Discuss the artwork with the student.

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:21.829
Then follow with the questions found in the some people say section.

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:27.510
Then, read the summary and discuss the review questions.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.349
Your student can enter the date the lesson was completed.

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:36.349
Each lesson provides a goal for the student.

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:40.950
And the explore section offers additional content that may be useful depending on your

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.109
student's needs and interests.

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:47.390
Yes, this tool is very different.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.950
Why was it designed this way?

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.750
It's a lot like the teaching used in artheocratic schools.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.150
It is very interactive.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:02.109
On one hand, the lessons are written in such a way to really make the student think about

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:03.709
what he is learning.

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:09.189
This tool has the ability to involve the Bible student.

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:13.830
It shows them with video and then they have references they can look at.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.870
But the way that it's designed involves them.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.150
And it really is going to give them a good foundation.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.189
On the other hand, the teacher can use the viewpoint questions to draw out how the

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:33.229
student really feels about what he's learning from God's Word.

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:39.270
This is the most thoroughly field-tested publication that we have ever produced from writing

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.949
the text to simplifying the text, polishing it, getting it ready.

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:51.270
It has been produced so that it can be translated into many languages so as to help people

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.669
everywhere.

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:56.189
Yes, this tool is very different.

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.830
What is it effective?

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.590
Hundreds of publishers in almost 100 lands tested the lessons.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.830
What do they say about it?

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.789
I love the new layout.

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:10.669
It's current and it's intuitive.

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:16.389
And the way the Bible truths are presented, it's very logical and easy to understand.

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.389
I think it's going to be a game-tanger.

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.030
The dig deeper section is amazing.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.550
It ensures that the teaching comes directly from the Bible.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.229
Because this part of the study becomes a conversation, the students answer right from

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:37.270
their hearts, which allows me to learn a lot more about how they think and feel.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.710
The new method really helps us to convince the mind and reach the heart.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.150
Most of all, it helps both the teacher and the student to focus on the scriptures rather

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.030
than on the study.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.509
We never heard anybody say the paragraph says.

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:59.430
Because when they did answer the question, they were expressing what they really believed.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.469
The lessons are both logical and concise.

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:06.430
The method is highly interactive.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.150
The students not only respond in their own words, but are also able to come to the correct

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.909
conclusions all by themselves.

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:21.430
It helps me as the teacher to talk less, and it helps the student to express himself

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.910
and to think.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.550
And the videos are listed in the comment sometimes are even a personal nature that probably

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.029
never were to come out and not been for the videos.

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:36.069
The aim is to get an Ocehova, to love Jehova, to learn what his will is for us and to

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:42.470
do that will, and also to draw close to his organisation.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.910
It has been a full-time service for over 50 years.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.029
I conduct several Bible studies.

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:52.269
These lessons cannot be compared with others.

00:04:52.269 --> 00:04:58.550
They are more effective and just what we need for our times.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.910
It equips them to explain to others what they have learned.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:10.870
And as a teacher, that fills me with so much joy that I am motivated to be zealous and

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.189
to find more new Bible studies.

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:18.269
We are so excited about this new approach to teaching Bible truths.

00:05:18.269 --> 00:05:23.949
The main point stand out, the application is clear and it's easy to remember, and everybody

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:29.069
can benefit from it from those with little or no education to those who are highly educated.

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:31.829
Our students are going to love this new publication.

00:05:31.829 --> 00:05:36.430
And we will, too, is this will make us better teachers of God's Word so as to make more

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.430
disciples before the end comes.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.629
And how do members of the governing body feel about this innovative approach?

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:50.829
This book has the potential to draw many honest hearted ones into Jehovah's organisation,

00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:56.269
to serve alongside us in pure worship and dedicate their lives to Jehovah.

00:05:56.269 --> 00:06:02.470
Compared to all the Bible study tools we've used in the past, this is gold.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.110
And that's what it's all about.

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:11.949
Helping that student build a close relationship with Jehovah and unquestionably, this new publication,

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:19.470
this marvelous gift from Jehovah will help us accomplish this worthy goal.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:26.430
We recognize humbly that whatever tool we use, only Jehovah can make it grow.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:34.110
So we're praying that Jehovah will grant success to this new tool to build and make disciples

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.310
of Christ.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:44.949
We are not just preachers, we are teachers, we are disciples makers.

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:53.829
This new book gives us what we need to help others love Jehovah, follow Christ, get baptized,

00:06:53.829 --> 00:06:56.430
and enjoy life forever.
