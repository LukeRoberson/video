00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:09.359
My husband was full of life, you know, full of energy, and he loved people.

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:15.199
My husband became ill and I needed a little more help, family-wise, so we decided to move

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:16.760
to Texas.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.120
We were actually ready to leave, so we were ready to pull out.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.920
He noticed something that he needed to check with the vehicle, that he was driving, and

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.480
he was under the truck.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.119
He jumped and started to roll.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.520
I jumped out of the car and ran around, and he wasn't breathing, and it immediately killed

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.039
him.

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:44.119
Everything was just in shambles.

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:48.240
We had no landing spot, because everything was packed on our truck.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.960
Well, a sister came and asked us to stay with her.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.880
On the morning of the funeral, I dreaded thinking about what else we were to do for the rest

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.479
of that day when she brought us into the kitchen.

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:08.879
It was just so bright and warm and cheery, and compares into the week we had just gone

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:09.879
through.

00:01:09.879 --> 00:01:17.439
She had arranged to have a beautiful breakfast feast, and we prayed, and we read scriptures

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:18.439
together.

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:24.840
We had the morning text together, and we were able to focus on the resurrection hope.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.560
I no longer dreaded the day, but I felt like we were able to just go ahead and do what

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.829
we needed to do, because we had Jehovah's re-assured it.

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:48.489
The good news, the sister shared with me, it changed that dreaded feeling to being what

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:51.590
Jehovah wanted us to feel.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.909
She wants us to focus on the hope, the way she helped us that morning, helped us focus

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.590
completely on that hope.
