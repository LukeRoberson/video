00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.929
We began to hear a lot of noise outside.

00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:10.500
When I came out, I saw volcano fire.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.500
I saw many people running.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.500
I was the only grown-up at home at the time.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.500
I was very afraid because it was my first time seeing such a disaster.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.500
Before the war, we had many things.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:34.219
But it became worse in July 2017.

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:42.829
So we left, and our goods were destroyed.

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:50.939
When we heard that there would be war at our village, people were very afraid.

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:58.850
We didn't take many things, and we went to Uganda.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.849
In the morning, we were informed that our house was among the houses destroyed by the volcano.

00:01:05.849 --> 00:01:10.849
This news affected us very much because when we left, we took nothing.

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:13.849
So we lost everything.

00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:15.849
When we were running away,

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:21.129
my father said that we must go to the beach to look for a boat.

00:01:21.129 --> 00:01:25.239
He was on a motorbike.

00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:29.239
He had an accident, and he was wounded.

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:32.239
That wound made him suffer for a time.

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:35.239
And that led to his death.

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:42.400
We fled from Bukwa to Búnia.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.629
Búnia is very far from Bukwa.

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:55.629
We were very afraid because in Búnia, we didn't have a field, and we didn't have a house.

00:01:55.629 --> 00:01:58.629
So we wondered how will we live in Búnia.

00:01:58.629 --> 00:02:05.129
The way present sisters helped me strengthened my faith.

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:09.889
That strong faith made me joyful.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:21.580
When we came back to Congo, I continued studying until I got baptized.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.580
Jehovah's organization did much, very much for us.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.580
First, they took care of us spiritually and physically.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.580
And second, they gave us a place to live, a home.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.580
Because of that, I am so thankful to Jehovah.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:52.310
What helped at that period of time was the thought we find at Psalm 46, 1 and 2.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.310
That scripture shows that God is our refuge.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:02.879
So we have nothing to fear, even though the world changes.

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.879
And even though the mountain topples to the depths of the sea, we cannot fear.

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:19.620
And I saw the fulfillment of that scripture in my life.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.939
Even though I had difficult circumstances in my life, I cannot give up.

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:31.439
I will serve Jehovah for all my life.

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:35.099
Now I'm feeling very well.

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.099
I am very happy to be in Jehovah's organization.

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:44.099
I'm determined to serve Jehovah all my days and to keep my integrity.

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:49.099
I decided to show Jehovah the same love and happiness shown to me.

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.099
Now I'm a regular pioneer.

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.099
Now I'm an auxiliary pioneer.

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:03.460
Now I'm a regular pioneer and a ministerial servant in our congregation.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.460
I also work as a remote volunteer for Bethel.
