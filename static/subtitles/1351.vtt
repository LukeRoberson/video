00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:08.679
Our objective has always been to make our literature available

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:11.679
to as many people as possible.

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:19.679
Recently, a secular book fair was arranged in the city of Guadalajara in Mexico.

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:26.679
Our brothers thought it would be the perfect opportunity to help the visitors learn more

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:30.679
about the best book ever written, The Bible.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.780
Preaching where the people are is crucial and here there are thousands.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.780
In a short time, we can reach people that we wouldn't normally find at home.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.780
A lot of young people visited us here.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.780
I really like how you have it set up with books and brochures.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.130
The images have a lot of questions, but they don't ask them.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.129
If God is so powerful, why does He let us suffer?

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.129
That's a question that a lot of people ask themselves since we think of God as the Almighty.

00:01:10.129 --> 00:01:13.129
In a lot of times, that's why many people lose their faith.

00:01:14.129 --> 00:01:16.129
One of my students is a Jehovah's Witness.

00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:20.129
I was once able to get a whole of a copy of the book, Young People Ask.

00:01:20.129 --> 00:01:24.129
And I found the information there very interesting, very complete.

00:01:24.129 --> 00:01:28.129
It's really helped me in particular to raise my daughters.

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:33.129
Many people were surprised to learn that our publications are distributed completely free of charge.

00:01:33.129 --> 00:01:38.129
What cut my attention is your generosity, offering publications without expecting anything

00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:40.129
in return.

00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:43.129
In fact, one person even seemed a bit annoyed.

00:01:43.129 --> 00:01:46.129
He said, how is it possible that you don't charge for this?

00:01:46.129 --> 00:01:48.129
He said, this is worth a lot.

00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:51.129
We were very surprised by the public's response.

00:01:51.129 --> 00:01:55.129
Around 30,000 publications were distributed.

00:01:55.129 --> 00:02:02.129
In fact, just between volumes one and two of the book, Young People Ask, Answers That Work,

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:05.129
some 8,000 copies were placed.

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:13.129
One of the main objectives of our book was to draw attention to the content on our JW.org website.

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:18.949
To begin with, what really caught my attention with the video.

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:24.949
What has really drawn people's attention is they're being able to watch the videos for themselves.

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:26.949
That really attracts them.

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:35.949
Kids learn through videos, so it's very important for us as humans to teach our kids values using these different tools.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.360
As parents, our duty is to mold our children into persons with good principles, good values.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.360
A teacher watched the whiteboard animation videos, and that's what most impressed her.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.360
She said she's going to use them in a classroom.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.360
From what I saw, to me the site is very good, very educational.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.360
I think it's great. You can help thousands of people right from the intimacy of their homes,

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.360
and it's very comfortable to consult Bible-based information.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.360
If they had knocked on my door, I probably would have shouldn't have on them.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.360
But I think this method is very different. To me, it's a lot more dynamic.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.360
I was one of those persons who would just take the literature and I was like, just leave it with me.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.360
Maybe I'll read it later.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.360
I think that when we get a hold of a tablet or a laptop and we start opening web pages,

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.360
and especially the Jehovah's Witnesses site, you start seeing what you need without having to ask questions,

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.360
and especially because the pages are so eye-catching.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.360
What's happening here is really important, and I think what you people are doing is great.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.360
I was a completely different person before, but this has helped my family to be more united.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:04:17.240
But fine results will undoubtedly come from this new initiative.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:24.240
The Central America branch received approval from the service committee of the governing body for this event.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.240
Such requests are reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
