00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.219
Hey there! Ready for the final product?

00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:23.420
Ta-da!

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.980
It's the three Hebrews in the fiery furnace!

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.420
Eh, could use some work.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.380
That sure is an exciting account.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.820
But how did they end up in a scorching oven?

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.979
Come on, I'll show you.

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:41.979
It's a great story.

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:46.460
Hananaya, Mishael and Aziraya

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.859
were just boys when they were taken to Babylon.

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:50.859
Daniel was there, too.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.380
People there were not Jehovah's friends.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.899
They wanted the Hebrews to be just like them.

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.060
They gave them Babylonian names.

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:02.700
Shade Rack, Mishael and Abednego.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.980
And food that Jehovah said they shouldn't eat.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.659
But together with Daniel, they obeyed Jehovah.

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:11.900
Because they were his friends.

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:16.540
Then one day, the king of Babylon told everyone

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.859
to bow down and worship a statue.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.140
And anyone who didn't would be thrown into a fiery furnace.

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:28.219
Would the three Hebrews give into the pressure of the king

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:29.980
and everyone else around them?

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:31.900
Of course not.

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.739
They knew that only Jehovah deserved their worship.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.700
If they obeyed him before, they knew they could do it again.

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.219
They declared our God whom we serve

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:45.980
is able to rescue us, O King.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.060
But even if he does not,

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:52.459
we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold.

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:55.579
Jehovah's friends always obey him.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.579
But how did Jehovah rescue them?

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.579
Wow, what a cliffhanger.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.740
Why not read the whole story and find out for yourself?

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.860
Make time every day to learn from Jehovah's friends.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.259
What do you think?

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.500
How did Hananiah, Mishael and Azaraya,

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.419
show that they were Jehovah's friends?

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.180
When is it hard for you to obey Jehovah?

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.139
And what can you do to obey Jehovah like they did?
