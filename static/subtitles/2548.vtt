00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.799
Recently, an exciting announcement was made to the brothers and sisters living in the

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:08.320
Britain branch territory.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.880
Initial approval has been granted to relocate the local branch offices.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.879
In fact, this is the second largest construction project that our organization is currently

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:22.399
undertaking.

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:28.239
Hundreds of brothers and sisters have worked for well over a year to get the project to

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.280
this stage.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:38.840
The first construction volunteers are now living on location.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:52.030
Hundreds more will be needed to transform this site into the new Britain branch office.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.030
Why is this move needed and how will it be accomplished?

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.989
Jehovah's Witnesses have been sharing the Bible's message for over 100 years.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.870
Every year, more and more books and magazines are distributed.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:17.069
To organize this, Jehovah's Witnesses maintain branch offices around the world.

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:23.590
Printing the world's most widely circulated magazines takes a lot of effort.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.989
To keep up, our branch offices must run efficiently.

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:34.390
The branch office in Britain has a large part to play in this growing work, but faces

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.430
challenges.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.870
Its properties are fragmented, spread out over a 10 mile radius.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.950
The decision was made to relocate.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:53.750
In 2014, an 85 acre property was purchased to accommodate the new Britain branch office.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.109
Right now, the site is being prepared for construction.

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:03.829
A small army of volunteers will then fit out the property, turning the site into a beautiful

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.039
new Bethel home.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:15.560
It is expected that these new facilities will be completed and operational by December 31,

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.879
2019.

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:33.039
At that time, the Bethel family will move in.

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:41.860
Here, in this very office, skilled volunteers are hard at work designing the new branch.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:48.620
There are structural engineers, architects, interior designers, landscapers, solicitors

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.979
and so many more.

00:02:50.979 --> 00:03:01.689
Each willingly gives of their time without charge.

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:05.689
At the heart of the site will be the printer.

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:10.930
Office buildings and support facilities will be situated nearby.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.849
Modest accommodation will house the Bethel family.

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:21.740
These buildings will complement the beautiful countryside.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.259
Building this branch is a huge task.

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:32.419
Jehovah has always loved using willing volunteers on construction projects, such as the arc,

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:37.169
the tabernacle and the temple.

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:40.569
Jehovah is no different today.

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:47.889
He will use humble, hard-working volunteers to make this and many other construction projects

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:52.530
around the world a success.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.289
What makes this work unique?

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:58.050
These aren't just ordinary buildings.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:06.879
They are structures that support preaching the good news of God's Kingdom.

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:13.360
There has never been a greater need for volunteers within Jehovah's organisation.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.879
Can you be a part of this special project?

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:20.800
Are construction projects that you can get involved in, where you live?
