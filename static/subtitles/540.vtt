WEBVTT

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:07.980
Ezra 7.10, that's the scripture we're discussing, and Ezra prepared his heart so he could

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.179
teach the regulations of Jehovah God.

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:11.779
Well, how does that happen?

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:20.940
Well, he did so through prayer, through his own meditation, through his personal study,

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.019
through observing other faithful and loyal servants of Jehovah God.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:32.859
Well, this is the very same process that we use in order to teach at a Bible study.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:40.299
I'd like to, though, at this time see how we can apply Ezra's words and example

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:42.859
when offering public prayers.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.939
Now, at times, though, we're privileged to offer prayer,

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:49.420
a, maybe here at Bethel in congregation,

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.219
shepherding calls, those are given by brothers.

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.899
But, you know, there is another form of public prayer offered by often sisters,

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:03.820
and it's the prayer with a Bible student.

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:10.099
Now, for a moment, consider the prayers that a Bible student may be familiar with.

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:13.060
He probably never heard the name Jehovah in a prayer.

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:20.260
Probably he's heard some renderings of the our Father prayer, or has heard a minister,

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.219
a reader prayer from a prayer book.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:32.340
But how different now the prayers are going to be from the teacher and those that may accompany

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:40.260
the teacher? Really, our prayers reflect our own relationship with Jehovah God

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.420
that we have developed over time.

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:48.420
Our prayers are influenced not only by our past experience in life,

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.939
but also by observing other loyal servants of Jehovah God, and listening to their prayers as well.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.379
Let's see how that was the case with Ezra.

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:05.459
Now, the inside book says this, that Ezra lived during the time of Mardachai and Esther

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:12.580
when the decree went out for the king to exterminate the Jews throughout the Persian Empire.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:20.259
There were many Jews that were living in Babylon, so this national crisis had an

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:27.620
indelible imprint on Ezra, strengthening his faith in Jehovah God, and that he would deliver his

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:34.340
people. As a result, Ezra witnessed the reaction of the people to this.

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:43.460
If you turn to Esther, chapter 4, verse 3, listen to what's recorded.

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:51.780
And in every province where the king's word and his decree reached, there was great morning

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:59.300
among the Jews, along with fasting and weeping and whaling. Many were lying down in sackcloth

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:08.099
and ashes. Now, public fasting was often accompanied by earnest supplication in Ezra,

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:17.060
would have realized that Esther was carrying on this fervent supplication to Jehovah God at that

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:24.580
time as well. And this all helped to galvanize Ezra's faith. See, he witnessed how Jehovah delivered

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:32.099
his people in this very seemingly impossible situation and how Jehovah protected his people

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:40.020
from the enemies and living through all of that helped to shape Ezra's inclination towards

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:49.669
prayer. See, he learned that prayer is powerful. And that's the way it's happened to all of us,

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:58.310
too, hasn't it? We've all been eyewitnesses to Jehovah's loving care for us and for his people,

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:04.789
and these experiences have shaped our communications with Jehovah God.

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:11.830
Now, there's something else that helped Ezra. The inside book says that he was an untiring

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:18.310
researcher with discernment and deciding between various readings of the copies of the law

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:25.829
existing then. So imagine the impression that was made on him while he was comparing the different

00:04:25.829 --> 00:04:33.990
renderings of the prayers that he was copying, prayers from Moses, Hannah, David, and Daniel.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:41.990
And as a result, this would have impressed upon him what kind of prayers Jehovah wanted to have

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:50.389
recorded. So from his long life experience observing the faith of others and prayers of others,

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:57.110
then he was able to meditate on now what about God's regulation is going to help my audience,

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:05.670
and what about his regulations and experience of these people can I use in my prayers in speaking

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:14.310
to Jehovah in their behalf. And thus, I'd helped him to be able to teach the law and to pray to

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:20.470
reach the hearts of the listeners. In preparing to say a prayer before large gathering of

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:28.149
worshipers, one brother explains this, he said, I consider in advance what to give thanks far,

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:34.310
what requests the brothers might have, and what petitions I could mention on their behalf.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:41.269
I put my ideas, including expressions of praise in the right order in my mind,

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:47.990
before saying the public prayer, I say a silent prayer, asking for help to represent the brothers

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:57.110
in a dignified manner. Well, the same process is followed in offering a prayer at a Bible study.

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:04.870
What specific needs does a student have that we would feel comfortable addressing Jehovah

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:12.310
in their presence? Are they struggling with a bad habit? Maybe experiencing ridicule from

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:18.790
family or workmates or schoolmates? So, are the holidays or other celebrations a challenge for them?

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:26.790
What could we commend them for before Jehovah God? Have they taken a stand against holiday or

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:33.829
smoking or immorality? Are they speaking to others about what they're learning? What progress

00:06:33.829 --> 00:06:41.910
are they making? Now, public prayers do not have to be long and elaborate. Generally,

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:49.829
short and meaningful is best. Let's see an example of when Ezra prayed in behalf of others

00:06:49.829 --> 00:07:02.420
petitioning Jehovah for his guidance. We can go to Ezra chapter 8 and 21 and 23. He says,

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:10.740
then I proclaimed a fast there at the river Aheva to humble ourselves before our God, to seek

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:19.939
guidance from him, for our journey, for us and for our children, and for all our goods and 23.

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:26.100
So, we fasted and made requests of our God concerning this, and he listened to our

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:34.579
entreaty. No doubt Ezra recalled the fasting that accompanied the earnest petitions of Esther

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:41.620
years earlier. He sought guidance from Jehovah God in the assignment that he had at hand.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:47.379
He was traveling with enormous riches on this occasion, and from a human perspective,

00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:54.740
was effectively unarmed and defenseless. So, this was the first for him. He had never been down

00:07:54.740 --> 00:08:02.740
this road before. He needed and prayed for God's guidance and protection. Well, the Bible's student

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:12.019
likewise is beginning to traverse the cramped road mentioned at Matthew 7 verse 14. And like Ezra,

00:08:12.019 --> 00:08:18.500
he may feel I've never been down this road before, and he needs guidance. So, in our prayers,

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:26.660
we might ask Jehovah to give them more faith to trust in Jehovah God. We can specifically ask

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:36.019
Jehovah to empower the student as needed. Now, we're to caution here. If we are accompanying someone

00:08:36.019 --> 00:08:42.179
on a Bible study, and we're asked to say one of the prayers, it'd be good for us to remember

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:50.340
that we don't have the teacher student relationship. The conductor has that relationship.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:58.899
So, as a guest on the study, we wouldn't want our prayers to become too specific in connection

00:08:58.899 --> 00:09:06.899
with the needs of the student. But our prayers at a Bible study can really have powerful,

00:09:06.899 --> 00:09:14.419
motivating effect on them. One pioneer sister in Sierra Leone conducts 15 Bible studies each week.

00:09:14.419 --> 00:09:20.419
And here's what she said, besides all the prayers offered when in the other features of the ministry

00:09:20.419 --> 00:09:28.100
and on other occasions, I am able to pray to Jehovah 30 times a week on behalf of my Bible studies.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:36.500
These prayers seem to have a beneficial effect and strong influence on the progress of the students.

00:09:38.019 --> 00:09:46.419
So, when we're praying on behalf of others publicly, let us prepare our heart, like Ezra,

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:54.019
by giving careful thought to the content of our prayers. Let's consider the student's needs and

00:09:54.019 --> 00:10:01.059
how we can articulate that in our petitions to Jehovah and then set the example of humility

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:09.620
by asking Jehovah to help us and ask for his forgiveness. Never underestimate the far-reaching

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:18.019
effects of our sincere prayers in behalf of others. Really, we become their advocate in our prayers.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:25.860
And as a Bible student listens to our prayers, he will learn how to pray from his heart to Jehovah God

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:32.899
and he will learn as did Ezra that prayer is powerful.
