00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:08.140
Welcome to our Special Morning Worship program for the most important day of the year.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:13.380
It's a real privilege this morning, not just to speak to the Bethel family, but to be able

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.699
to share some scriptural thoughts with the majority of our dear brothers and sisters

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:25.100
right around the world, including you, wherever you may be this morning.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.780
All of us are looking forward with excitement to this evening when we unitedly remember

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.219
the death of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:38.780
But first, let's start by reading the scripture text selected for today.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.460
We're going to ask Brother David Schaefer, I hope, with the teaching committee, to read

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.939
for us this morning.

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:48.899
Please, David, let's have the scripture text read.

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.939
Tuesday, April 7, 2020, the memorial date, after sundown.

00:00:55.939 --> 00:01:01.259
The text is taken from Romans chapter 5 and verse 8.

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:04.540
Christ died for us.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.459
Thank you, David.

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:10.819
Imagine please that you are in a prison cell.

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:16.620
You've just been notified that you will be executed in the morning because of your faith.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.219
There is no further means of appeal.

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:22.420
The decision is final.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.379
How will you spend this last night?

00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:27.379
What will you do?

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:30.500
What will you think about?

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.459
Some of our brothers and sisters in the past have found themselves in this challenging situation.

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:42.540
Many of these used their last night to write letters to strengthen and comfort their friends

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.019
and relatives.

00:01:45.019 --> 00:01:51.099
For example, consider the courageous words written by one young brother to his family as

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:55.900
he awaited death at the hands of Nazi persecutors.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.900
He wrote,

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.540
It is already past midnight.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.420
I still have time to change my mind.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.620
Ah, could I be happy again in this world after I had denied our Lord?

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.699
Surely not.

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:20.060
But now you have the assurance that I leave this world in happiness and peace.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.740
Because this dear brother didn't use that final evening just to focus on his own hardships.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.340
Rather, he used part of that evening to encourage those whom he loved.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:40.060
He wanted to strengthen them so that they wouldn't be overwhelmed by the sad news of his death.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.780
Well with these thoughts in mind, let's now think about how Jesus spent his last evening

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.819
as a human here on earth.

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.020
To start with, let's ask this question.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:01.340
By the time of that evening, what did Jesus know about the circumstances of his death?

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.340
To answer that question, let's read together what stated in Matthew 20.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:14.580
So if you turn with me please, to Matthew 20 verses 18 and 19.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.340
Jesus said,

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:25.460
Look, we are going up to Jerusalem and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priest and the scribes.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:34.900
They will condemn him to death and hand him over to men of the nations to be mocked and scourged and executed on a stake.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.659
And on the third day he will be raised up.

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:48.419
So on that final evening, what did Jesus already know about his death and what would he have been thinking about?

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:53.340
These verses that we just read mention four things.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:01.460
First of all, it tells us that he knew he would be handed over to the Jewish religious leaders who would take him to court

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:08.580
and find him guilty of a crime, perhaps one including the charge of blasphemy.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:20.579
Second, Jesus knew that he would be handed over to men of the nations, in other words the Romans, and that they would violently abuse him.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.579
Third, he knew that he would be executed on a stake.

00:04:25.579 --> 00:04:32.579
And the final point, he realized that he would be resurrected on the third day.

00:04:32.579 --> 00:04:42.899
So on that final evening, Jesus already knew some of the details concerning his death and these would have weighed heavily on his mind.

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:46.660
But were there any other things that he already knew?

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:53.100
Yes, let's consider another three facts that were on his mind that evening.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.740
The first one will notice if we turn to the book of John this time.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:05.480
John chapter 13, and we're going to start by reading verse 21.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:12.759
After saying these things, Jesus became troubled in spirit, and he will witness saying,

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:17.879
most truly I say to you, one of you will betray me.

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:24.560
Now if we turn across to verse 26, it tells us that Jesus continued to say,

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.399
it is the one to whom I will give the peace of bread that I dip.

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:37.680
So after dipping the bread, he took it and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon the scarred.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:46.199
Jesus knew that one of his apostles would betray him, and he even knew who his betrayer would be.

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:56.519
Now for something else that Jesus knew, let's read verse 38 of the same chapter, John 13 and verse 38.

00:05:56.519 --> 00:05:59.199
Jesus here said to Peter,

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:03.000
will you surrender your life in my behalf?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:11.879
Most truly I say to you, a rooster will by no means crow until you have disowned me three times.

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:17.800
So Jesus also knew that Peter would deny him three times.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:28.120
And for another point, let's turn to John chapter 16, John 16 and verse 32.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.399
He is speaking to his apostles, Jesus said,

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:35.839
look, the hour is coming, indeed it has come,

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:42.800
when each one of you will be scattered to his own house and you will leave me alone.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:49.879
So Jesus also realized that the rest of his apostles would run away and desert him.

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:53.439
So what did Jesus have on his mind that evening?

00:06:53.439 --> 00:07:01.199
Not only would Jesus have been thinking about his upcoming court trial, persecution and execution.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:10.370
He also knew that he would be betrayed, denied and abandoned.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:16.250
Now if you were Jesus, how would you have reacted to this knowledge?

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:21.769
Perhaps you would have preferred to be by yourself, avoiding those who would fail you.

00:07:21.769 --> 00:07:26.490
You might have thought it's better for me to spend the evening in prayer,

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:31.490
preparing properly without these negative distractions.

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:33.490
Just think about it.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:40.449
Despite all these negative things, Jesus didn't hide away and stay by himself.

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:47.930
In fact, he told his apostles that he greatly desired to celebrate this last Passover with them.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:54.689
In other words, he wasn't going to miss the meeting because of these negative things.

00:07:54.689 --> 00:08:03.930
Amazingly, even with all these things on his mind, Jesus focused on how to help his faithful apostles.

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:09.889
He loved them and he wanted to prepare them for what was about to happen.

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:18.009
In fact, in John's account, five chapters are devoted to Jesus' final words of encouragement to his apostles.

00:08:18.009 --> 00:08:23.850
What an amazing, unsophish love Jesus showed.

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:29.410
Just imagine, Jesus took the time to wash the feet of his apostles,

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:33.409
even the feet of his betrayer, due to his scarier.

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:37.330
Not only were the apostles unwilling to do this lowly service,

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:43.490
but when Jesus started to wash their feet, not one of them stood up and offered to take over.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.889
Yes, they had a real problem with their attitude.

00:08:46.889 --> 00:08:53.809
That was further shown by the fact that they had an argument that evening about who was the greatest among them.

00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:59.129
But do we see the evidence of Jesus' love in all of this?

00:08:59.129 --> 00:09:02.129
He didn't give up on them.

00:09:02.129 --> 00:09:08.210
Jesus didn't allow these failures to cause him to have a negative view of his apostles.

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:16.250
Instead, he commended his 11 faithful apostles and even made a covenant with them to be part of his kingdom.

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:19.289
Isn't that truly amazing?

00:09:19.289 --> 00:09:26.169
Additionally, Jesus earnestly prayed to Jehovah, not only to watch over those apostles,

00:09:26.169 --> 00:09:30.090
but also to care for those who would later believe in him.

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.330
That includes us today.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.570
Despite all the negative things on his mind,

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:41.570
Jesus focused on strengthening others and praying for them.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:46.570
What an expression of unsophish love.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:52.690
This evening, we'll be focusing on the love Jehovah and Jesus express for us.

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:56.649
But as we meditate on the events of nice and 14,

00:09:56.649 --> 00:10:03.730
let's also remember how Jesus proved his love for his apostles by not giving up on them.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:10.529
Even at a time when his thoughts would have been focused on the excruciating death that lay ahead of him,

00:10:10.529 --> 00:10:18.149
he patiently helped them so that they could deal with what was about to happen.

00:10:18.149 --> 00:10:21.070
What lessons can we learn from this?

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:24.149
Well, this may not be the last night of our life,

00:10:24.149 --> 00:10:27.830
and we may not expect to be executed tomorrow.

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:34.149
But how can we imitate the love that Jesus displayed that final evening?

00:10:34.149 --> 00:10:38.029
Here are some things we can all be determined to do.

00:10:38.029 --> 00:10:44.190
Don't give up on our brothers and sisters, even if at times they seem to file us.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:50.629
Continue to strengthen others even when we are facing difficulties.

00:10:50.629 --> 00:10:58.669
In this way, we will also prove our genuine love for Jehovah and his loving son, Jesus Christ.

00:10:58.669 --> 00:11:02.470
Now, David, let's have our comments read.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:06.110
Jesus was willing not only to die for his disciples,

00:11:06.149 --> 00:11:10.830
but also to live each day in a way that put their interests ahead of his own.

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:16.590
For instance, he met with his followers even when he was physically tired or emotionally distressed,

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:21.750
and he focused on what he could give to others, not on what he could get from them.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:24.590
We belong to the only true Christian brotherhood,

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:29.830
and we enjoy spending as much time as possible, inviting new ones to join us.

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:34.830
However, we are particularly interested in helping those who are related to us in the faith,

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:37.669
but who have become inactive.

00:11:37.669 --> 00:11:44.470
We prove our love for them by encouraging them to attend our meetings, especially the memorial.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:52.710
Like Jehovah and Jesus, we are deeply moved when an inactive one returns to Jehovah.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:56.029
Thank you, David, for reading for us this morning.

00:11:56.029 --> 00:12:08.700
Now we're going to turn our attention to our scheduled Bible reading for this morning.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.860
Now, on the first day of the unleavened bread,

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:19.100
when they customarily offered up the Passover sacrifice, his disciples said to him,

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:23.019
Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?

00:12:23.019 --> 00:12:28.220
With that, he sent two of his disciples and said to them,

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:33.779
Go into the city, and a man carrying an earthenware water jar will meet you.

00:12:33.779 --> 00:12:37.299
Follow him, and wherever he goes inside,

00:12:37.299 --> 00:12:41.139
say to the master of the house, the teacher says,

00:12:41.139 --> 00:12:45.940
Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:50.820
And he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.379
Prepare it for us there.

00:12:53.379 --> 00:12:57.220
So the disciples went out, and they entered the city,

00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:09.500
and found it just as he said to them, and they prepared for the Passover.

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:15.419
On the first day of the unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying,

00:13:15.419 --> 00:13:19.340
Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.940
He said,

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:24.779
Go into the city to sow and sow, and say to him,

00:13:24.779 --> 00:13:26.379
The teacher says,

00:13:26.379 --> 00:13:28.700
My appointed time is near.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:33.539
I will celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your home.

00:13:33.539 --> 00:13:45.100
So the disciples did as Jesus instructed them, and prepared for the Passover.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:50.139
After evening had fallen, he came with the twelve,

00:13:50.139 --> 00:13:55.820
and as they were reclining at the table and eating, Jesus said,

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.820
Truly I say to you,

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:02.620
One of you who is eating with me will betray me.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:08.700
They began to be grieved, and to say to him one by one,

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.820
It is not I, is it?

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:14.139
He said to them,

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:19.340
It is one of the twelve, the one dipping with me into the bowl.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:24.379
For the Son of Man is going away, just as it is written about him.

00:14:24.379 --> 00:14:29.500
But woe to that man, through whom the Son of Man is betrayed.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:35.100
It would have been better for that man, if he had not been born.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:39.659
And as they continued eating, he took a loaf,

00:14:39.659 --> 00:14:44.779
Said a blessing, broke it, and gave it to them, saying,

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:48.460
Take it, this means my body.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:54.779
And taking a cup, he offered thanks, and gave it to them,

00:14:54.779 --> 00:14:59.100
And they all drank out of it, and he said to them,

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:05.419
This means my blood of the covenant, which is to be poured out in behalf of many.

00:15:06.379 --> 00:15:12.299
Truly I say to you, I will by no means drink any more of the product of the vine,

00:15:12.299 --> 00:15:16.299
Until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.

00:15:17.659 --> 00:15:23.019
Finally, after singing praises, they went out to them out of allies.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.700
And Jesus said to them,

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.779
You will all be stumbled, for it is written.

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:35.419
I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered about.

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:40.860
But after I have been raised up, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.

00:15:42.139 --> 00:15:43.740
But Peter said to him,

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.899
Even if all the others are stumbled, I will not be.

00:15:49.179 --> 00:15:51.659
At that Jesus said to him,

00:15:52.539 --> 00:15:59.580
Truly I say to you that today, yes, on this very night, before a rooster crows twice,

00:16:00.539 --> 00:16:02.940
You will disown me three times.

00:16:04.299 --> 00:16:06.220
But he kept insisting,

00:16:07.179 --> 00:16:11.179
If I have to die with you, I will by no means disown you.

00:16:12.299 --> 00:16:16.299
Also, all the others began to say the same thing.

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:23.340
So they came to a spot named Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples,

00:16:24.379 --> 00:16:26.460
Sit down here while I pray.

00:16:27.419 --> 00:16:35.259
And he took Peter and James and John along with him, and he began to feel deeply distressed,

00:16:35.259 --> 00:16:39.340
And to be greatly troubled. He said to them,

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:43.820
I am deeply grieved, even to death.

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.580
Stay here, and keep on the watch.

00:16:48.779 --> 00:16:55.899
And going a little way forward, he fell to the ground, and began praying that,

00:16:55.980 --> 00:17:00.620
If it were possible, the hour might pass away from him.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.539
And he said,

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:10.940
Abba, Father, all things are possible for you, remove this cup from me,

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:16.220
Yet not what I want, but what you want.

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:22.700
He returned and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter,

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:25.900
Simon, are you sleeping?

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:30.380
Did you not have the strength to keep on the watch for one hour?

00:17:31.339 --> 00:17:37.500
Keep on the watch, and pray continually, so that you do not come into temptation.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:43.099
The Spirit, of course, is eager, but the flesh is weak.

00:17:44.299 --> 00:17:49.500
And he went away again and prayed, saying the same thing.

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:56.380
And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were weighed down,

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:59.019
so they did not know what to answer him.

00:18:00.059 --> 00:18:04.299
And he returned the third time, and said to them,

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:09.019
At such a time as this, you are sleeping and resting.

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:18.059
It is enough. The hour has come. Look, the son of man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:24.299
Get up, let us go. Look, my betrayer has drawn near.

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:33.180
And immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve arrived,

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:40.859
and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the scribes and the

00:18:40.859 --> 00:18:47.259
elders. Now his betrayer had given them an agreed sign, saying,

00:18:48.299 --> 00:18:56.299
whoever it is I kiss, he is the one, take him into custody, and lead him away under guard.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:01.980
And he came straight up and approached him and said,

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:12.059
Rabbi, and gave him a tender kiss, so they seized him and took him into custody.

00:19:12.859 --> 00:19:19.900
However, one of those standing by drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest,

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:25.579
taking off his ear. But in response, Jesus said to them,

00:19:26.539 --> 00:19:31.420
Did you come out to arrest me with swords and clubs as against a robber?

00:19:32.299 --> 00:19:38.380
Day after day, I was with you in the temple teaching, and yet you did not take me into custody.

00:19:39.259 --> 00:19:42.380
Nevertheless, this is to fulfill the scriptures.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:53.500
And they all abandoned him and fled. However, a certain young man wearing only a fine linen

00:19:53.500 --> 00:20:00.859
garment over his naked body began to follow him nearby, and they tried to seize him,

00:20:00.859 --> 00:20:04.940
but he left his linen garment behind and got away naked.

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:13.420
They now led Jesus away to the high priest, and all the chief priests and the elders and the

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:22.220
scribes assembled. But Peter, from a good distance, followed him as far as into the courtyard of the

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:29.019
high priest, and he was sitting together with the house attendants and warming himself before a

00:20:29.019 --> 00:20:36.700
bright fire. Now the chief priests and the entire Sanhedrin were looking for testimony against

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:45.019
Jesus in order to put him to death, but they were not finding any. Many indeed were giving false

00:20:45.019 --> 00:20:52.700
witness against him, but their testimonies were not in agreement. Also, certain ones were

00:20:52.700 --> 00:21:01.180
standing up and bearing false witness against him, saying, We heard him say, I will throw down

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:07.980
this temple that was made with hands, and in three days I will build another not made with hands.

00:21:09.019 --> 00:21:14.059
But even on these grounds, their testimony was not in agreement.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:22.619
Then the high priest stood up in their midst and questioned Jesus, saying, Do you say nothing

00:21:22.619 --> 00:21:32.380
and reply? What is it these men are testifying against you? But he kept silent and made no reply at

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:41.819
all. Again the high priest began to question him and said to him, Are you the Christ, the son of

00:21:41.819 --> 00:21:51.740
the blessed one? Then Jesus said, I am, and you will see the son of man sitting at the right hand

00:21:51.740 --> 00:22:00.859
of power and coming with the clouds of heaven. At this the high priest ripped his garments and said,

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:08.700
What further need do we have of witnesses? You heard the blasphemy. What is your decision?

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:18.700
They all condemned him as deserving of death, and some started to spit on him and to cover his

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:28.859
face and hit him with their fists and say to him, And slapping him in the face, the court

00:22:28.859 --> 00:22:36.779
attendance took him. Now while Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the

00:22:36.779 --> 00:22:46.380
high priest came. On seeing Peter warming himself, she looked straight at him and said, You too are

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:55.579
with the Nazarene, this Jesus. But he denied it, saying, Neither do I know him nor do I understand

00:22:55.579 --> 00:23:04.299
what you are talking about. And he went outside to the entryway. There the servant girls saw him

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:12.619
and again began to say to those standing by, This is one of them. Again he was denying it.

00:23:13.579 --> 00:23:21.740
And after a little while, those standing by again began saying to Peter, Certainly you are one

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:31.819
of them, for you are in fact a Galilean. But he started to curse and swear, I do not know this man

00:23:31.819 --> 00:23:41.339
of whom you speak. Immediately a rooster crowed a second time, and Peter recalled what Jesus

00:23:41.339 --> 00:23:51.900
had said to him, Before a rooster crowed twice, You will disown me three times. And he broke down

00:23:52.539 --> 00:24:02.700
and began to weep. We're sure that those verses have helped to prepare us for the memorial

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:10.460
this evening. But before we finish, we'd like to assure you that the governing body loves you all.

00:24:11.579 --> 00:24:18.539
Wherever you may be this evening, no matter what challenges you may face, it's our heartfelt wish

00:24:18.539 --> 00:24:25.980
that Jehovah will richly bless you all. May our United efforts to be at the memorial this evening

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:31.099
bring praise to our loving Heavenly Father, Jehovah and His Son, Jesus Christ.
