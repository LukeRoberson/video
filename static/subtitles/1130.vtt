00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.370
Have you ever been distressed?

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:11.449
Well, if you haven't, you're not human, because all humans suffer from some form of distress

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:17.690
in a short period of life that we have this side of the New World.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.050
But what is distress?

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.050
Some say it's extreme anxiety, others say, well, it's sorrow, then there's a few who label

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.769
it as pain.

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.090
Well, what is it that causes the distress?

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.969
Well, a number of things.

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:39.969
Here's one that somewhat heads the list, death of a spouse.

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:47.689
Second behind that is injury or some type of illness, then there's loss of a job.

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:51.969
How am I going to care for my family, my wife and my children?

00:00:51.969 --> 00:01:00.380
And then here's a very important one, not being able to share in the kingdom preaching

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.859
work to the full.

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.500
Well, these are reasons that we are distressed.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.620
Now, of course, these are not the only reasons, there's many others.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.540
But how would you fare?

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.739
How would you feel if you're undergoing some type of distress?

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:26.459
Well, could it be sad that how you're going to feel?

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:28.060
Are you depressed?

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.459
Some say, well, yes, that's what hits me.

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:38.939
Others say, well, low in spirits, I just, I don't know, I'm just down and out.

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.280
My get up and go, got up and left.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.560
Others say, well, I just feel like going off and hiding and crying.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:57.760
Well, that pretty well sums it up, but is it possible to rejoice when distress?

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.040
Well, we know it is because we have examples in the Bible.

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:04.000
The Bible is filled with examples.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:14.120
We're just going to isolate one or two, Paul was one who rejoiced behind being distressed.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.919
He was able to rejoice despite the feelings that he had.

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:24.080
Now if you have your Bible handy, open it, please, to 2 Corinthians.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.319
And read along with me, 2 Corinthians chapter 7 and verse 5.

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:36.800
So notice that it says, in fact, when we arrived in Macedonia, our bodies got no relief.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.360
But we continue to be afflicted in every way.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.199
Now note the following.

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:47.800
There were fights on the outside, fears within.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.800
Fights on the outside, fears within.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:57.400
Yes, Paul was up against it, and he knew it, but yet he was able to rejoice.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.599
But what was he up against?

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.159
Earlier, Paul had hoped to meet up with Titus and Troas, but he hadn't heard from Titus,

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:06.639
and he didn't get a message from him.

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:08.319
He wondered about him.

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:17.919
He wondered how he was feeling, was something hard hitting against him at this time

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:21.039
in that Corinthian congregation.

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:22.800
So Paul wanted to know.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.439
So he worried about his friend, and we would, too, if we were waiting to hear from a friend

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.800
we hadn't received an answer.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.919
He likely worried it.

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:41.919
So much that it caused him to feel somewhat depressed.

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:49.280
He thought, well, how long will I have to wait on my friend Titus?

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.400
Well, he didn't have to wait too long.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.800
Titus finally joined him in Macedonia.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.800
And what happened?

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.280
Well, Paul was comforted, and upon hearing the Titus favorable report about the brothers

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:09.400
and sisters in Corinth, Paul rejoiced even more, says 2 Corinthians chapter 7, if you're

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.479
just glassed down at verses 6 and 7.

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:17.040
So he was helped by his brother.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.600
It's the brotherhood that we have to reach out to, too, and it will help us.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.720
This beautiful brotherhood that Jehovah has brought us into.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.759
And we'll find that our brothers are there for us, regardless of what we may be fighting

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:34.759
against.

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:37.519
So we can rejoice.

00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:44.279
We may experience distress in the form of discouragement, and usually all of us have

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:48.120
had that come into our life from time to time.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.439
There are so many things that can bring about discouragement.

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:52.439
Here's something else.

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:57.160
The anguish over a lost loved one, maybe a marriage made has died.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.680
You've been together for many years.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.000
And like Jehovah said in the Garden of Eden, the two shall become one.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.839
And you know that's really what happened to you and your wife that you lost or your husband,

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:11.480
not to you lost.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.759
So you are somewhat low in spirits.

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:25.519
You are blue, you're a little downhearted, gloomy, heavyhearted, and yes sad.

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:33.199
But now let's recall that we have three provisions that can strengthen our ability to rejoice

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:37.399
despite the trials that we're undergoing.

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:38.399
What are they?

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:39.399
Well, here's the first one.

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:43.480
Yes, our relationship with Jehovah.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.439
David had a fine relationship with Jehovah.

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:52.000
And if you'll turn to 1 Samuel, chapter 30, and just follow along, as you hear me say

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.720
a few things behind these two, three verses or four, we're going to start with verse

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.000
1, that's 1 Samuel, chapter 30.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.920
When his own men wanted to kill David because the amelikites burned the city down and had

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:16.639
taken their wives and children captive, even took two of David's wives, well David was

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:20.240
very distressed, as you'll see in that account.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.680
But now notice near the end of it there in verse 6.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:29.279
But David strengthened himself by Jehovah, his God.

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:35.160
Here's where our strength comes to is from turning to Jehovah our God.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.680
And he's there for us.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.560
And he's going to comfort us.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:44.480
He is the God of comfort, as was acknowledged in his written word of the Bible.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.480
So that's the first.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.600
Our relationship with Jehovah.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.399
Now here comes the second.

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:52.639
It's our brotherhood.

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:56.839
My how we are strengthened by our brothers.

00:06:56.839 --> 00:07:04.920
Remember the 133rd Psalm where it says at the very beginning, look how good and how pleasant

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.120
it is for our brothers to dwell together in unity.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.240
Now we all know that that is a true statement.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.800
But we also know something else.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:24.040
It's a major scheme of Satan the devil to isolate us from our brothers if he can put us

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.240
in jail.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.319
But if that happens and we are jailed, we can still associate.

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:34.720
Now how can we do that if we're jailed and there's way off somewhere and we're behind

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.199
bars?

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:39.879
Here it is by memories.

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:46.199
For instance, get out your scrapbook and photo album that are locked in your brain.

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:53.399
Not the literal, that locked in your brain and feed on the spiritual scraps.

00:07:53.399 --> 00:07:54.399
What are they?

00:07:54.399 --> 00:07:56.160
The memories.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.240
Memories are foods that strengthen and cause rejoicing.

00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:07.160
Now if any of you out there are as old as I am, then you know that old folks do this

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.000
all the time.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.040
We're just too tired to do anything else.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.240
So we just live on memories and it brings joy to our heart.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.399
Now that's the second thing our brotherhood.

00:08:18.399 --> 00:08:21.120
Now the third is our hope.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:27.079
Our hope is to serve Jehovah under righteous conditions throughout eternity.

00:08:27.079 --> 00:08:29.759
It is forever.

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:31.319
It never ends.

00:08:31.319 --> 00:08:35.480
It goes on and on and on.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.120
For instance, look at the sky above.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.919
You cannot see a beginning or ending.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.919
That's eternity.

00:08:44.919 --> 00:08:45.919
Always there.

00:08:45.919 --> 00:08:51.080
You're going to be able to rejoice for an eternity living forever.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:56.320
Now as you watch the following video, take note of which provisions helped our brother

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:11.220
and sister to rejoice and that despite distress.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:15.940
We knew when we first got married that we would enjoy having a family.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:20.460
So when we first found out that we were pregnant, we were overjoyed.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:26.899
When Becky first told me she was pregnant, it's like a light switch went off in my heart.

00:09:26.899 --> 00:09:30.259
Immediately I felt like a dad.

00:09:30.259 --> 00:09:34.820
But instantly you began to make plans.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:41.429
It was like all this love just flooded in.

00:09:41.429 --> 00:09:44.710
One day Becky was feeling a little off and a friend encouraged us to just go see the

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:45.710
doctor.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:46.710
So we did.

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:50.429
And while we were there, they did an ultrasound.

00:09:50.429 --> 00:09:58.620
The doctor came back and they said there wasn't a heartbeat anymore.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:03.460
That was a very difficult moment.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:11.539
Something I can never forget, because all of a sudden, all of you, those hopes, those

00:10:11.539 --> 00:10:21.649
dreams, those preparations you are making, they're gone.

00:10:21.649 --> 00:10:29.139
This place in your heart that opened up to make room for this child is now this huge

00:10:29.139 --> 00:10:36.740
gaping open hole and there's nothing to fill it.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:41.259
It just is an incredible emptiness.

00:10:41.259 --> 00:10:50.419
We didn't know what to do, but it was a meeting night, so we wanted to go to the meeting.

00:10:50.419 --> 00:10:55.139
It felt like the place where Jehovah's Holy Spirit is, and we wanted to be there because

00:10:55.139 --> 00:11:00.379
we knew we were not going to be able to survive this on our own strength.

00:11:00.379 --> 00:11:04.100
We needed Jehovah.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:09.539
After people learned that we had lost the baby, so many people shared a little bit of their

00:11:09.539 --> 00:11:15.899
experiences with me, which made us feel not alone, for sure.

00:11:15.899 --> 00:11:21.500
But Jehovah has also given us some incredible friends, friends that have stuck closer to

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.820
us than a brother, friends that always seem to know when we're having a hard day, who

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:32.460
have prayed with us, who have taken walks with us, listened, and I know those are expressions

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:36.299
Jehovah has given us.

00:11:36.299 --> 00:11:41.340
And gaining joy isn't work in progress.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:48.460
There was a particular scripture in personal study that I found very helpful, Psalm 39,

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:54.460
where it talks about how there's nowhere that Jehovah can't find us.

00:11:54.460 --> 00:12:00.659
There's no darkness that is too dark from Jehovah, and it felt like such a dark place, dwelling

00:12:00.659 --> 00:12:06.220
on that scripture, was something that helped me a lot, and gradually bit by bit.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:15.970
I felt like Jehovah did help me to see beautiful things again.

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:23.889
When we experience distress, Jehovah helps us, we're not left in despair.

00:12:23.889 --> 00:12:31.330
For instance, here in 2 Corinthians chapter 4, it tells us if we also include the footnote,

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:35.769
now that's the eighth verse of 2 Corinthians chapter 4.

00:12:35.769 --> 00:12:41.490
Now this is how it reads, we're hard pressed in every way, but not cramped beyond movement.

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:46.970
We're perplexed, but not absolutely with no way out.

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:52.769
Now the footnote says, not left in despair.

00:12:52.769 --> 00:12:56.409
Jehovah's not going to leave us in despair.

00:12:56.409 --> 00:13:01.970
Now which provisions from Jehovah are helping you to rejoice, despite any mental or emotional

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:07.129
distress that you may be experiencing even now?

00:13:07.129 --> 00:13:17.480
Is it your relationship with Jehovah, the brotherhood, our hope, or is it something else?

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:24.720
In addition to the provisions from Jehovah, consider these practical suggestions.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:36.240
Being a healthy diet, coupled with that, gets sufficient rest and gets a measure of exercise.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.279
Now you can make two lists.

00:13:39.279 --> 00:13:48.360
One of the problems that you can solve and the other problems you cannot solve at present.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:55.480
Act on the first list and leave the rest in Jehovah's hands.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:14:03.779
Some things out with an elder, or perhaps a mature friend, someone you're close to,

00:14:03.779 --> 00:14:06.879
and a parent.

00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:14.639
These are there to help us, and they're ready and willing to share the knowledge and understanding

00:14:14.639 --> 00:14:20.600
that they have, and they'll do it generously with you.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:26.279
These are some forms of mental distress may require professional assistance.

00:14:26.279 --> 00:14:32.960
This is what Jesus said at Luke chapter 5, verse 31, those who are healthy do not need

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:37.639
a physician, but those who are ill do.

00:14:37.639 --> 00:14:43.200
Now of course that decision is up to you, but if they're in the Scripture, it may be that

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:51.000
you need the help of a physician, someone who's qualified to look into certain matters.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.480
Please rejoice in knowing that you have Jehovah's approval.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.159
Don't doubt it, not even for a moment.

00:14:59.159 --> 00:15:08.519
Now granted, it's not easy to deal with mental or emotional distress, but keep in mind

00:15:08.519 --> 00:15:17.279
that Jehovah understands, and he will help you to keep on enduring.

00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:23.799
And your loyal endurance brings you over to approval, which is one of the greatest reasons

00:15:23.799 --> 00:15:26.679
that we have for rejoicing.

00:15:26.679 --> 00:15:30.000
Know that God has not left you.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:38.639
You have His approval like a large shield surrounding you and His blessing.

00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:48.100
So rejoice in that knowledge and keep on rejoicing despite distress.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:53.659
Brother Garrett Loesch, a member of the governing body will now present the next talk of this

00:15:53.659 --> 00:15:55.100
symposium.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:59.100
We can rejoice despite persecution.
