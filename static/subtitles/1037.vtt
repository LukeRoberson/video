00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.860
Over the years, there were many sisters without standing faith.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.019
Sister Matsui, she was one of them.

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.019
She was born in Japan in 1909.

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:20.859
Although she grew up in the Buddhist family, she had a thirst for Bible knowledge.

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:28.899
In 1918, the Spanish flu hit her area and she saw lots of coffins with dead bodies.

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:36.679
She and her elders sister both also caught the Spanish flu and a week later her sister died.

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:43.520
She wondered, why do people die and what happens to them at death?

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:55.000
In 1928, when Matsui was 19, her father arranged for her to marry Giso Ishi a jealous Buddhist.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.640
Matsui was introduced to the truth in Osaka through the book The Heart of God.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:11.120
That was given to her by a brother who lived in a neighboring house that belonged to the International Bible Students Association.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:20.079
Matsui was baptized in March 1929 and her husband Giso was baptized a short time later.

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:30.519
In June 1939, when she was 30 years old, she and her husband were arrested and were separated from each other.

00:01:30.519 --> 00:01:33.680
This certainly called for a faith.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:41.359
She said that she nearly died when she was in solitary confinement for almost a year.

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:51.000
Matsui was released toward the end of 1944 and she was reunited with Giso after World War II ended.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.500
Both she and her husband had remained faithful.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.739
Let us now consider another encouraging example.

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:09.219
Right after World War II ended, far away from Japan in Estonia, Northeastern Europe,

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:19.699
Taylor Tom was introduced to the truth in April 1945 and was baptized in August 1946 at age 20.

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:28.539
She was arrested by the Communists on December 27, 1950, and sentenced to imprisonment.

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:36.740
She was sent to a slave labor camp in Russia, the infamous Wakuta camp, above the Arctic Circle,

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:44.580
and later to other prison camps, 250 miles or 400 kilometers southeast of Moscow.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.500
The sisters continued to be spiritually minded.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:56.580
They made miniature copies of the watchtower and put them inside bars of soap and re-sealed the soap.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.740
This certainly called for a faith.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:09.819
She did not have to serve for 13 years, but actually was released on May 4, 1956 after five and a half years.

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.539
The year after, she married Brother Lempid Tom.

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:24.939
However, the threat of searches and arrests continued until the preaching work was legalized in Estonia in 1991.

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:45.560
In the following video, note some other details regarding the lives of these two faithful women, Matsui Ishi and Ella Tom.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:04:00.469
For nearly a year, I had been held in solitary confinement in a tiny filthy, bug-infested prison cell.

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:07.909
Five and a half years after my arrest, I was released.

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:15.990
If we truly rely on Jehovah, really love him and cry out in a heart for his help,

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:35.379
just as he did not forsake me, he will not forsake his servants.

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:39.459
They arrested me and took me in for questioning.

00:04:39.459 --> 00:04:47.509
An interrogator invited me to sign a document stating that I would discontinue preaching.

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:52.949
I said, I would rather live in prison with my relationship with God and tact,

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:58.329
than be free and lose his approval.

00:04:58.329 --> 00:05:03.050
My determination has been to heed the Bible admonition.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.970
Trust in Jehovah and do good.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:19.610
I have learned that doing this leads to receiving the requests of your heart.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.449
How did the sisters Ishi and Tom show faith?

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:30.089
Please turn with me to Psalm 37.

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:38.329
Sister Ishi had faith that Jehovah would not abandon her, in line with Psalm 37, 25,

00:05:38.329 --> 00:05:40.649
which reads,

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:46.889
I was once young and now I'm old, but I have not seen anyone righteous abandoned

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:51.459
nor his children looking for bread.

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:57.860
Her faith helped her to endure a difficult test of integrity.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:04.339
She was arrested on June 21, 1939, and taken to a police station,

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:10.339
and put into a dark cell with suit hanging from the ceiling.

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:18.019
The after, she was transferred to another location and put into solitary confinement.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:25.379
Her husband was also arrested, and she did not see him until the war had ended.

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:29.699
I nearly died in that cell, she said.

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:33.300
But she was exposed to another test too.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:39.860
When interrogated, she found out from the officials that Junso Akashi,

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.699
the overseer of the Japan branch, had abandoned the truth.

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:50.740
Sister Ishi replied, Akashi is only an imperfect human.

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:53.860
He is no longer my brother.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.459
Sister Ishi remained loyal.

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:06.620
Similarly, Sister Tom from Estonia refused to compromise or to abandon her faith.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.379
She prayed and meditated on Bible principles in order to endure,

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:21.019
like Psalm 119, verses 97 and 98 say,

00:07:24.019 --> 00:07:28.819
How I do love your law, I ponder over it all day long.

00:07:29.939 --> 00:07:36.819
Your commandment makes me wiser than my enemies because it is with me forever.

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:46.329
In 1949, Ella Tom was arrested by the communists.

00:07:46.329 --> 00:07:48.170
They took her in for questioning.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:55.610
She reports, forced to remove all my clothing and being watched by young police officers,

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.449
I felt humiliated.

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:04.810
Yet after I prayed to Jehovah, peace and calmness of heart came over me.

00:08:07.139 --> 00:08:11.699
Next, I was put in a tiny cell where I could not even lie down.

00:08:12.579 --> 00:08:15.459
I was taken out only for interrogations.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:22.579
The officers would say, we are not asking you to deny the existence of God,

00:08:22.579 --> 00:08:24.980
just stop your stupid preaching.

00:08:26.019 --> 00:08:32.389
You can have a promising future and they would threaten,

00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:38.710
quote, Do you want to live or do you want to die with your God on the fields of Siberia?

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:46.230
She said, For three days I was prevented from falling asleep between the repeated

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:52.309
interrogations. Meditation on Bible principles helped me to endure.

00:08:53.909 --> 00:09:01.269
Finally, an interrogator invited me to sign a document stating that I would discontinue preaching.

00:09:03.429 --> 00:09:06.950
I have given this matter much thought, I said.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:13.669
And I would rather live in prison with my relationship with God intact than to be free

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:20.389
and lose his approval. At that interrogator shouted,

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:26.230
You fool, all of you will be arrested and sent to Siberia.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:31.509
But she was unexpectedly set free at midnight.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:35.590
However, was arrested again sometime later.

00:09:37.029 --> 00:09:43.830
In the following dramatization, note how a brother shows faith like that of sister's issue and

00:09:55.159 --> 00:10:03.350
as the world went from bad to worse, I dug deeper into God's word.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:24.299
I wanted to stay strong like so many brothers and sisters in the past.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:32.379
Those who remain faithful had no special abilities and were inconspicuous.

00:10:33.419 --> 00:10:39.259
Surely all of us must always trust in Jehovah with all our heart.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.419
I memorized scriptures.

00:10:45.179 --> 00:10:54.659
I knew these words would build my faith and give me the strength I needed to face what was to come.

00:11:39.019 --> 00:11:54.330
Trust in Jehovah and do what is good. Reside in the earth and act with faithfulness.

00:11:55.289 --> 00:12:01.049
Find exquisite delight in Jehovah and you will grant you the desires of your heart.

00:12:04.789 --> 00:12:08.950
We had to be more discreet, but we never stopped talking about God's word.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:19.539
We had to face many difficulties, but with God's word embedded in our hearts,

00:12:20.259 --> 00:12:23.379
we faithfully endure it to the end.

00:12:38.059 --> 00:12:43.980
Build faith by meditating on Jehovah's goodness to his people and to you personally.

00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:48.059
How can you imitate Rahab?

00:12:49.179 --> 00:12:55.740
Take a firm stand for true worship, even if you have only a limited knowledge of the truth.

00:12:58.419 --> 00:12:59.779
How to imitate Hannah?

00:13:00.899 --> 00:13:05.860
Build faith by taking note of Jehovah's answers to your prayers.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.240
How can you imitate the captive Israelite girl?

00:13:12.919 --> 00:13:19.879
Young ones show faith by sharing the good news with schoolmates, teachers, and the

00:13:19.879 --> 00:13:21.480
unbelieving family members.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.440
You can also imitate the mother of Jesus, Mary.

00:13:27.639 --> 00:13:32.679
How? Strengthen your faith and trust in Jehovah.

00:13:33.639 --> 00:13:37.799
Carefully examine the scriptures and meditate on them.

00:13:40.409 --> 00:13:42.809
How can you imitate the Phoenician woman?

00:13:43.929 --> 00:13:49.370
Recognize whom Jehovah is using to do his will and associate yourself with them?

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:54.730
How can you imitate Mary, the sister of Lazarus?

00:13:56.330 --> 00:14:02.409
Build faith by considering all that God's word says about His wonderful promises.

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:11.450
The Bible says, Mary sat down at the feet of the Lord and kept listening to what He was saying.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:17.580
How can you imitate sister's ishi and the tomb?

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:23.899
Let the power of God's word motivate you to endure faithfully.

00:14:23.899 --> 00:14:31.019
When we clearly perceive the great cloud of witnesses surrounding us,

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:37.659
we can run with endurance the race that is set before us as Hebrews 12.

00:14:37.659 --> 00:14:39.820
Verse 1 encourages us to do.

00:14:41.419 --> 00:14:47.580
Like these faithful women, we can all be included in Jehovah's book of remembrance,

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:55.100
as mentioned at Malachi 3.16 and inherit everlasting blessings.
