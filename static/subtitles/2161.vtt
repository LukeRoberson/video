00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:25.550
It's like I've come home, I was lost until Jehovah took me in.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:40.369
Once I face my fears alone, now I share them all, all with him.

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:51.369
He brings comfort to my life, makes me feel that I belong.

00:00:51.369 --> 00:01:07.780
He says, draw close to me, close to me, and I'll draw close to you.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:22.799
I'll help you see, help you see, the good that I see in you.

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:58.950
If you draw close to me, begins to condemn me.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:14.830
It's so hard to let it go, so I pray to God, it won't last.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:39.180
He says, draw close to me, close to me, and I'll draw close to you.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:58.479
I'll help you see, help you see, the good that I see in you.

00:02:58.479 --> 00:04:08.509
He says, draw close to me, close to me, and I'll draw close to you.

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:19.839
Good that I see, if you draw close to me.
