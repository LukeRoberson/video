00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:13.039
In recent years, we've enjoyed watching the Inside Story and it really has helped us to get to know some of the students a little better and to get the Inside Story.

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:23.039
So let's enjoy this presentation of the Inside Story is presented by one of the other lecturers or the instructors in Gilead, Brother Richard Chilton.

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.579
All of us have a story.

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.579
But how is that story written?

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:35.579
A literal book contains a beginning, a middle, and an end.

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:43.579
And by the time we hold that book in our hand, each chapter has been carefully analyzed and locked in.

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.579
That story is done, finished.

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.579
Well what about us?

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.579
Do you ever feel that your story is pretty much locked in, finished?

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:03.579
That the opportunity to make changes in connection with your service to Jehovah has passed you by?

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:40.170
If so, please pay special attention to what our guests have to share with us today on this edition of the Inside Story.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:50.430
The first couple we would like to introduce is Tomash and Eva Marushka from Slovakia.

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:04.219
What Tomash and Eva, it is so nice to have you with us on this edition of the Inside Story. Welcome.

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:05.219
Thank you.

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.219
Now we understand that you both grew up in a country that was under bear.

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:13.219
Can you tell us a little bit about that?

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:16.219
We remember growing up when the work was under bear.

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:21.219
The change came later in 1989 at the end of the year.

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:26.219
And finally in 1993 the work was officially registered as Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.219
During a band all the things are very different like we know today.

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:34.219
For example there were no assemblies, no conventions at all, publicly held like today.

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:37.219
Of course no kingdom halls were available at that time.

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:42.219
So how did you hold your meetings if there were no assemblies and no kingdom halls?

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:47.219
So I remember they were held in small groups in private homes of our brothers.

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:51.219
And usually they were held very late in the evening.

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:57.219
As children we really struggled to stay awake and do not fall asleep during a meeting.

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:02.219
Under those circumstances how did you handle the matter of literature?

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:08.219
So there were no officially printed and imported publications from our organization.

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:13.219
It was forbidden under ban. However we had homemade publications.

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:17.219
I remember growing up on a book, My Book of Bible Stories.

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:21.219
It was transcripts of the stories but without no pictures.

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:25.219
So we had to really use our imagination and just to imagine all those stories.

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:27.219
Also in our family.

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:30.219
Tell us a little bit about your side of that story too.

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:32.219
Yeah, very similar thing.

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:36.219
My parents were involved in literature production.

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:39.219
It was either by typing or by photography.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:43.219
Now when you were both children and growing up under this environment

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:47.219
were you allowed into these rooms where this printing was taking place?

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:53.219
So we are very curious as kids and of course we still try to figure out what is inside.

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:57.219
We called it a secret room because all the secrets were kept there.

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:03.219
And there was this equipment for making copies of literature, simple camera,

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:08.219
it took a photo and then with a magnifier they could make a different size of publications.

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:14.219
Smaller it was, it was easier to carry for friends to meetings and also easier to hide of course.

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:20.220
Now Eva it went just beyond this secret room in the attic in your house.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.220
There was another method that your parents used in connection with this literature.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.220
Can you tell us about that?

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.220
Yeah actually the literature then needed to be transported somehow to the groups

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.220
that were using the publications or to the families.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.220
So my parents did it the way that they taken the publications,

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.220
put it to the back seat of the car behind the back seat of the car.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.220
Now did you and your siblings know this literature was in the car?

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.220
No, they couldn't tell us.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.220
And there was also the way that they put it under our feet.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.220
And actually we are six kids and I am the youngest.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.220
So they put like four, five or six of us to the back seat of the car.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.220
We were sitting there patiently.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.220
And you know those cute little faces, they don't look like smugglers.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.220
When it's obvious your parents were thinking it through to protect everyone

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.220
and to keep the work going.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.220
That must have been very interesting growing up under those circumstances.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:21.220
Let's move now into your teen years and your early adult life.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.220
What was some of the circumstances that you had observed

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.220
that affected your view or attitude towards regular pioneering

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.220
in just the full time service in general?

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.220
So when I was growing up we had no regular pioneer at all in our congregation

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.220
and also just very few in our area.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:47.220
Was there any particular reason why there were so few pioneers in your area?

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.220
I would say that it took time to introduce and to understand the concept of pioneering.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:57.220
So sometimes more other spiritual goals were considered as more important.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.220
Because during a band nobody was really preaching publicly.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.220
So it took the time to understand this concept

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.220
and really to have pioneers in the congregation.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.220
And I remember the first one that I really met

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.220
and had the chance to work with was when I was 16.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.220
At the time three special pioneers were assigned to our congregation,

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.220
one couple and one single brother.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.220
And the single brother was accommodated in our home.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.220
So for us as two boys it was really like to have an older brother

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.220
at home, a spiritual single brother pioneering.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.220
So we could really see first pioneer from flesh and blood,

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.220
to see him alive and to we could observe his goals

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.220
and he spent a lot of time with us.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.220
So about how old were you then Thomas,

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.220
when you then started regular pioneering yourself?

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.220
So it was three years later,

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.220
it was when I was 19, I was the first one in our congregation.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.220
I tried, but at the time it was still very little support.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.220
We had just four regular pioneers in whole circuit.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.220
So then after several months,

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.220
I was struggling with a quota and several challenges came.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.220
So I decided to quit pioneering because I came to the conclusion

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.220
that it's not really probably for me,

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.220
so it's probably for others.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.220
What about in your case, Eva?

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.220
Actually, I never, as a growing up,

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.220
I never had like really idea what the pioneering means.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:20.220
So I didn't have that real need to start pioneering.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.220
The first time I started pioneering was when we were already married.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.220
And I said a goal to do it for one year,

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:31.220
but then also I stopped after one year.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.220
Okay, now you're in your mid-adult life here.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.220
What came next?

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.220
So I said that this was a turning point in our country

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.220
and we get several couples of missionaries.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.220
And they really brought the zeal, the pioneering spirit

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.220
from our congregations where they were pounding for decades.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:52.220
And this had a really nice influence on congregations and also circuits.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:56.220
You had mentioned, Eva, that when the missionaries came,

00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:00.220
you mentioned a specific effect they had on the rest of you.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.220
You want to tell us about that?

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.220
Well, I think it was huge.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.220
They just woke us up.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.220
They shown us what the pioneering means

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.220
that you can really enjoy the ministry.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.220
Yeah, we remember their enthusiasm for ministry.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.220
And it was really catchy to hear this missionary chant.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.220
These are going with the language.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.220
So they were just learning Slovak, with the broken Slovak.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.220
But they identified young couples

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.220
and really invested their time and energy.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.220
They gave us a lot of day-free time,

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.220
not just during the ministry, but they...

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.220
We made a great friendships with them.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:35.220
And until today we have great relationships with them.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.220
And you had mentioned when you were out in the ministry with them,

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:41.220
what was something that they showed you was okay,

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.220
that added to your journey?

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.220
Well, it's a very important thing.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.220
They showed us that we can drink coffee during the ministry.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.220
Yeah, go to tell them coffee.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.220
They made it fun for you.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.220
So where did that lead to?

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.220
So then later when we moved to another congregation

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:01.220
and this nice spirit and support of missionaries,

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.220
we decided to start this couple.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:06.220
Pioneering, I was around 28, 29 at this time.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.220
And we decided to start from a new service here.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:12.220
We really saw, really understand what does it mean

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.220
that Pioneer produced other pioneers?

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.220
Because within two years we had 25 or 26 regular pioneers.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:19.220
That's amazing.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:23.220
And they were supporting really every day the fruit service meetings.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:27.220
You never were searching for service partners.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.220
Anytime you wanted to go to a ministry,

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.220
you had a person to go with.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:35.220
And Jehovah blessed it because while we had a couple of Bible studies

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.220
and we were afraid.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.220
But after we started, it was a nice result

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.220
that Jehovah blessed pioneers in our congregation.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.220
Then what was the next change for you after you started pioneering?

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.220
What came next?

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:48.220
Well, I felt that some change need to be done

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:51.220
because I was little tired of everything.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:55.220
I was working eight hours day, securely.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.220
It was full-time work.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.220
And it was kind of international company

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.220
where everybody was just concerned about their career growth

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:04.220
and everything was about efficiency and work.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.220
I was a little afraid to even go.

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.220
Nobody ever asked for a reducing working hour.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.220
It was like more work.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.220
It's better.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.220
So we started to pray about it.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.220
And finally, I went.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:20.220
And they granted me that I could work from eight to 12 in the morning.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.220
But the amazing thing was that they gave me almost the same salary

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:28.220
as I had for eight hours, like full-time work.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.220
So your salary basically doubled.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.220
You would have to work, right?

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.220
How did you take advantage of that?

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.220
Well, at the time, the RTO was open.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.220
Yeah.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.220
And I was helping with the construction of the RTO

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.220
and our kingdom hall.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.220
And I started to commute for the RTO

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.220
to care about some technical stuff.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.220
And you were helping us going the RTO as commuter?

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.220
Yes.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.220
I was working like with service, food service,

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.220
and like with lunch.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.220
But I needed to be there at lunch time.

00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:00.220
So I needed to go back to employer and ask for,

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:05.220
like, moving my work time to the early morning hours.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:11.220
So I would wake up 4.30 until work like until 10.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.220
Actually, they granted also this thing to me.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.220
And we've seen that it was Jehovah behind

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:20.220
because it was nothing normal in this environment.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:22.220
So now you, with that change,

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.220
you were able to fully support the assignment at the RTO.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.220
Yeah, I could commute.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.220
Where did that lead to next?

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.220
We were very happy at the time because we were pioneering.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:33.220
We had a little bit of pioneering,

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.220
a bit of battle because of RTO.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:39.220
And we felt that we are doing a lot because of the work

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.220
and also supporting what we could.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.220
But then we decided to apply for school,

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.220
for King the Evangelizers.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.220
And then we submitted the application.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.220
There was a convention.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.220
So a couple from battle came.

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.220
And the brother, he asked us one question.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.220
And we still remember that question.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.220
Are you willing to serve anywhere?

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.220
And we were like, yes, of course.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.220
We are willing.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.220
And he asked us, what about battle service?

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.220
Well, we never thought about battle.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.220
It was quite surprising for us.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:11.220
But then we think about this encouragement.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.220
We prayed about that.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.220
And we decided to submit our applications for battle.

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.220
And surprising, maybe in several months,

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.220
we were invited to serve at battle.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:23.220
And so approximately what were your ages around this time

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:26.220
when you're finally now entering battle service?

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:29.220
I was 31, 32.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.220
She was younger.

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:32.220
She was younger.

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.220
We'll leave it at that.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.220
Good, good.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:37.220
So when you look back,

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.220
when you're alive now,

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.220
how do you feel about the adjustments

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.220
that you made in your service to Jehovah?

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.220
We never regretted any of those decisions,

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.220
setting spiritual goals,

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.220
start by entering support artio,

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.220
apply for battle service.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.220
Maybe one change we would do.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.220
We would start earlier if we could.

00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.220
Definitely.

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.220
Well, there's probably a number of us

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.220
that would feel similarly.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:04.220
But we're glad that you did make those adjustments.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:07.220
And it's obvious that Jehovah has blessed you for doing so.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.220
Thank you so much for taking time

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.220
to share your wonderful story with us.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.220
It really touched our hearts

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.220
and we appreciate that.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.220
Our pleasure.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:22.649
Thank you.

00:13:22.649 --> 00:13:25.649
Next, we'll enjoy the company of Jose

00:13:25.649 --> 00:13:28.649
and Andreina Palais.

00:13:28.649 --> 00:13:42.340
Welcome to the Inside Story

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.340
for Gilead Class 152.

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:49.340
Did you think you would ever hear those words in your lifetime?

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:50.340
No.

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.340
Never.

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.340
In fact, being a Gilead,

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:56.340
that is, it is a surprise of our lives.

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:59.340
Yes, it is definitely a surprise we never thought.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:02.340
Well, we are certainly happy to have you with us.

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:06.340
So you came to Gilead from Peru, Bethel.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.340
But before that, your home was Montreal,

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.340
Montreal, Canada.

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.340
How did that happen?

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:16.340
So I was born in Caracas in Venezuela.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:19.340
And that's where I learned the truth.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:21.340
When I was born, my grandmother was a witness.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.340
So she taught me the truth.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.340
Eventually, my mother, she got baptized.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.340
So she continued raising me in the truth.

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:30.340
And when I was 10 years old,

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:34.340
my family decided to move to immigrate to Montreal, Canada.

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.340
So we arrived there.

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:37.340
It was my mother, my brother,

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.340
and my non-believer stepfather.

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:40.340
OK.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.340
So you go from Caracas, Venezuela

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.340
to Montreal, Canada at 10 years of age.

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:48.340
How did you wind up in Montreal, Jose?

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.340
I was born in Lima in Peru.

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:53.340
And I heard about Jehovah when he was a child.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.340
The witnesses were coming to my house.

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:58.340
Some of my older brothers even studied the Bible.

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.340
Then when it was a teenager,

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:03.340
due to the political and economical situation of the country,

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.340
my parents decided to move to Canada,

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:06.340
to Montreal, Canada.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:08.340
My older brother was already living in Canada.

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.340
And he wasn't really a witness.

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.340
But sadly,

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:14.340
sadly, soon after we arrived,

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.340
a few months after my father, he died.

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:17.340
Oh, sorry to hear that.

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.340
Thank you.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:19.340
Thank you.

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:22.340
So my mom and I was with my brother.

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:25.340
But at that time, the congregation helped us a lot to progress

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:26.340
and get baptized.

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:30.340
So I made it a goal to strengthen my relationship with Jehovah.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.340
Then at the right moment of my life,

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:35.340
I made Andreina and eventually we got married.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.340
What happens next with you, too?

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.340
Now that you're married.

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:42.340
So when we got married, we were not regular pioneers.

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:44.340
But we had spoken about it.

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:47.340
We definitely wanted to make ourselves available.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:51.340
What were you doing then if you weren't regular pioneering at that point?

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:54.340
We both had a full-time jobs.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:16:00.340
And we were comfortable and enjoyed both of our jobs,

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:01.340
secular jobs.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:04.340
So the idea of regular pioneering was there.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:07.340
Like I said, it was a goal that I previously had.

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:09.340
But we had a long way to go.

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.340
Now, you had mentioned to me earlier

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:14.340
that you were about 16 years older.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.340
So when you first had this goal to pioneer.

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:17.340
Yes.

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.340
From 16 to what point do you finally now

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.340
reach entering the pioneer service?

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.340
Yes. So we started.

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.340
I was in my late 20s when we started.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.340
I was in my mid 30s when I started.

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.340
We wanted to, like we said before,

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.340
we wanted to increase our service to Jehovah.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.340
But there were different challenges there.

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:38.340
It's different adjustment that we wanted to do.

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:41.340
And something a turning point that happened at that time.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:44.340
When we wanted to expand our ministry service

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:47.340
to be more useful in the hands of Jehovah.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.340
The street could overheat of that time.

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:53.340
It was brother Jean Papino, his wife, sister Carla Papino.

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:57.340
They encouraged us very much to take the regular pioneering.

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:58.340
Yes.

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:01.340
I remember being with them out in the ministry during the week

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.340
that they would come to the congregation.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:06.339
And we always make a stop and go for coffee.

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:10.339
And we would enjoy their experiences and just that happiness

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:14.339
that we would see in them after each visit as a family worship.

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:19.339
We would discuss and see how we could then simplify our lives.

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:20.339
Because that was it.

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:22.339
We needed to simplify our lives.

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:26.339
And we started by taking regularly the auxiliary pioneer.

00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:30.339
And we became then eventually we started both

00:17:30.339 --> 00:17:32.339
this new chapter of our lives.

00:17:32.339 --> 00:17:34.339
We became regular pioneers.

00:17:34.339 --> 00:17:37.339
Now you're in your early to mid 30s.

00:17:37.339 --> 00:17:38.339
You're in your late 20s.

00:17:38.339 --> 00:17:40.339
And now you're with that encouragement.

00:17:40.339 --> 00:17:43.339
You're entering the pioneer service. That's good.

00:17:43.339 --> 00:17:46.339
So the pioneering, what you started pioneering is

00:17:46.339 --> 00:17:48.339
is that what now stirred your desire

00:17:48.339 --> 00:17:50.339
to want to serve with the need was greater?

00:17:50.339 --> 00:17:53.339
Oh, no, not at all.

00:17:53.339 --> 00:17:57.339
We always thought that serving in another country

00:17:57.339 --> 00:18:01.339
or with the need is greater even where the country we were

00:18:01.339 --> 00:18:04.339
was some maybe an experience from the yearbook,

00:18:04.339 --> 00:18:05.339
but not for us.

00:18:05.339 --> 00:18:08.339
And we thought that we just had waited too long,

00:18:08.339 --> 00:18:10.339
probably to take those type of decisions.

00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:14.339
So it was not something that we thought we could do.

00:18:14.339 --> 00:18:16.339
Correct. That's it.

00:18:16.339 --> 00:18:19.339
Many times we thought that we have waited too long

00:18:19.339 --> 00:18:21.339
to start regular pioneering.

00:18:21.339 --> 00:18:24.339
So the idea of serving in another country

00:18:24.339 --> 00:18:26.339
was never came to our mind.

00:18:26.339 --> 00:18:29.339
However, another turning point in our life

00:18:29.339 --> 00:18:33.339
was the encouragement of brother Jean Papino

00:18:33.339 --> 00:18:34.339
and his wife.

00:18:34.339 --> 00:18:37.339
Now you mentioned to me earlier that

00:18:37.339 --> 00:18:41.339
Brother Papino gave you an illustration

00:18:41.339 --> 00:18:44.339
that really got you thinking.

00:18:44.339 --> 00:18:45.339
What was that?

00:18:45.339 --> 00:18:50.339
Yes. When we were deciding to move,

00:18:50.339 --> 00:18:52.339
there was always fears.

00:18:53.339 --> 00:18:54.339
It's certain fears.

00:18:54.339 --> 00:18:57.339
Despite the fact that we were kind of already

00:18:57.339 --> 00:18:58.339
have the decision to go.

00:18:58.339 --> 00:19:01.339
So I mentioned this to Brother Papino

00:19:01.339 --> 00:19:03.339
about the fears we have.

00:19:03.339 --> 00:19:05.339
So he gave me an illustration.

00:19:05.339 --> 00:19:08.339
He told me, imagine there is a father

00:19:08.339 --> 00:19:11.339
and in front of him is a table.

00:19:11.339 --> 00:19:14.339
And on top of the table is his baby child

00:19:14.339 --> 00:19:16.339
of a two-year-old.

00:19:16.339 --> 00:19:18.339
And then all of a sudden,

00:19:18.339 --> 00:19:21.339
imagine that the child jumps to the floor

00:19:21.339 --> 00:19:22.339
and he asks me,

00:19:22.339 --> 00:19:24.339
what do you think the father is going to do?

00:19:24.339 --> 00:19:26.339
And I say, wow, he's going to write

00:19:26.339 --> 00:19:28.339
or we're going to try to grab his baby

00:19:28.339 --> 00:19:30.339
to a boy he stays on the floor.

00:19:30.339 --> 00:19:32.339
And he told me, well, that's exactly

00:19:32.339 --> 00:19:33.339
what you hope is going to do.

00:19:33.339 --> 00:19:34.339
If you jump to Peru,

00:19:34.339 --> 00:19:36.339
if you step over to Peru.

00:19:36.339 --> 00:19:38.339
So that was beautiful.

00:19:38.339 --> 00:19:41.339
And that gave us the strength,

00:19:41.339 --> 00:19:44.339
we can say, to achieve

00:19:44.339 --> 00:19:47.339
and take the decision to move to Peru.

00:19:47.339 --> 00:19:49.339
So what an illustration

00:19:49.339 --> 00:19:52.339
to get your minds and hearts thinking on it.

00:19:52.339 --> 00:19:54.339
Like he said, there was many fears.

00:19:54.339 --> 00:19:57.339
And also, we had our lives in Canada,

00:19:57.339 --> 00:19:58.339
our families.

00:19:58.339 --> 00:20:00.339
We had never been away from our families.

00:20:00.339 --> 00:20:02.339
But the encouragement we received

00:20:02.339 --> 00:20:04.339
definitely made a good impression.

00:20:04.339 --> 00:20:06.339
And then we prayed about it.

00:20:06.339 --> 00:20:10.339
And yes, we thought that it was possible for us.

00:20:10.339 --> 00:20:12.339
But it was not easy.

00:20:12.339 --> 00:20:14.339
We still wanted to do certain,

00:20:14.339 --> 00:20:17.339
needed to do certain adjustments.

00:20:17.339 --> 00:20:20.339
So Brother Papino was always encouraging us.

00:20:20.339 --> 00:20:24.339
Yes, he said, just to try it one year or two.

00:20:24.339 --> 00:20:25.339
Just to try it.

00:20:25.339 --> 00:20:27.339
If something doesn't work,

00:20:27.339 --> 00:20:29.339
then you can always come back.

00:20:29.339 --> 00:20:31.339
But you can taste what it is.

00:20:31.339 --> 00:20:33.339
What difference did that make for you?

00:20:33.339 --> 00:20:35.339
For him to give you that encouragement,

00:20:35.339 --> 00:20:38.339
to just put it in the context of just a year or two.

00:20:38.339 --> 00:20:40.339
Did that affect your decision at all?

00:20:40.339 --> 00:20:42.339
You know, way yes.

00:20:42.339 --> 00:20:45.339
Because, you know, the idea of moving,

00:20:45.339 --> 00:20:47.339
it was a big change.

00:20:47.339 --> 00:20:49.339
It was a big decision for us.

00:20:49.339 --> 00:20:52.339
And having in mind that we could go for one year,

00:20:52.339 --> 00:20:54.339
try it out, and then come back,

00:20:54.339 --> 00:20:58.339
it kind of smoothed the fears.

00:20:58.339 --> 00:21:01.339
So that was a good example for us.

00:21:01.339 --> 00:21:04.339
And we took the decision to move.

00:21:04.339 --> 00:21:06.339
We make certain adjustments in our life,

00:21:06.339 --> 00:21:09.339
in our secular works.

00:21:09.339 --> 00:21:11.339
We sell our belongings.

00:21:11.339 --> 00:21:13.339
And we set up a date.

00:21:13.339 --> 00:21:16.339
We had a date and said, by the end of this year,

00:21:16.339 --> 00:21:19.339
that was in 2012, we need to go to Peru.

00:21:19.339 --> 00:21:20.339
Yes.

00:21:20.339 --> 00:21:21.339
So you get down there.

00:21:21.339 --> 00:21:23.339
Where do you go once you arrive there?

00:21:23.339 --> 00:21:25.339
We arrive to Lima.

00:21:25.339 --> 00:21:27.339
And just a few weeks after,

00:21:27.339 --> 00:21:29.339
we move to Takna.

00:21:29.339 --> 00:21:32.339
This is the city in the south of Peru,

00:21:32.339 --> 00:21:33.339
border with Chile.

00:21:33.339 --> 00:21:36.339
We took a bus from Lima to Takna.

00:21:36.339 --> 00:21:40.339
That's 22 hours travel, a trip of 22 hours.

00:21:41.339 --> 00:21:43.339
So the south of Peru is desert.

00:21:43.339 --> 00:21:44.339
So you could imagine.

00:21:44.339 --> 00:21:47.339
So after five hours, six hours, seven hours, ten hours.

00:21:47.339 --> 00:21:48.339
I saw it on my left.

00:21:48.339 --> 00:21:49.339
It was sand.

00:21:49.339 --> 00:21:50.339
My ride was sand.

00:21:50.339 --> 00:21:51.339
On the back was sand.

00:21:51.339 --> 00:21:52.339
In the front was sand.

00:21:52.339 --> 00:21:54.339
So I said, Sandrina, where are we going?

00:21:54.339 --> 00:21:55.339
No idea.

00:21:55.339 --> 00:21:58.339
It was like that at all.

00:21:58.339 --> 00:22:01.339
But eventually, after 22 hours,

00:22:01.339 --> 00:22:03.339
we could see the city.

00:22:03.339 --> 00:22:04.339
We arrived.

00:22:04.339 --> 00:22:06.339
And yes, we were not going to leave just on sand.

00:22:06.339 --> 00:22:08.339
There was actually a city there.

00:22:08.339 --> 00:22:10.339
And that was going to be our new home.

00:22:10.339 --> 00:22:12.339
It started since the beginning of the first day.

00:22:12.339 --> 00:22:15.339
Jehovah was proving us that he was going to be there with us.

00:22:15.339 --> 00:22:19.339
And then another door opened for us.

00:22:19.339 --> 00:22:22.339
And that was to apply for the Biblical school

00:22:22.339 --> 00:22:25.339
for Christian couples back then.

00:22:25.339 --> 00:22:27.339
So when that door opened,

00:22:27.339 --> 00:22:32.339
we knew that the idea of just one year or two in Peru

00:22:32.339 --> 00:22:34.339
was going to change.

00:22:34.339 --> 00:22:35.339
And that's what happened.

00:22:35.339 --> 00:22:37.339
We attended school.

00:22:37.339 --> 00:22:40.339
One year and a half after we arrived in Tacna,

00:22:40.339 --> 00:22:42.339
that's when we were invited.

00:22:42.339 --> 00:22:45.339
And then we received an assignment.

00:22:45.339 --> 00:22:46.339
Yes.

00:22:46.339 --> 00:22:50.339
They give us the assignment to serve as temporary special pioneers

00:22:50.339 --> 00:22:54.339
in Abancai, which is in the Andes area of Peru.

00:22:54.339 --> 00:22:56.339
So you went from the desert to the mountains?

00:22:56.339 --> 00:22:57.339
Yes.

00:22:57.339 --> 00:23:01.339
So how long were you there in your special pioneer assignment?

00:23:01.339 --> 00:23:04.339
It was in total maybe five months.

00:23:04.339 --> 00:23:05.339
Yes.

00:23:05.339 --> 00:23:06.339
Why so short?

00:23:06.339 --> 00:23:08.339
The branch office calls us again,

00:23:08.339 --> 00:23:11.339
telling us that now we were going to receive an order assignment

00:23:11.339 --> 00:23:14.339
to work in the circuit work, serving the circuit work.

00:23:14.339 --> 00:23:17.339
But the circuit work was going to be in Lima.

00:23:17.339 --> 00:23:22.339
So you still had yet another course adjustment ahead of you.

00:23:22.339 --> 00:23:25.339
How long were you there in the circuit work now in Lima?

00:23:25.339 --> 00:23:29.339
So around the two years serving in that circuit work,

00:23:29.339 --> 00:23:31.339
in that circuit,

00:23:31.339 --> 00:23:33.339
the branch office called me.

00:23:33.339 --> 00:23:38.339
And the brother told me that they wanted to see us at the branch

00:23:38.339 --> 00:23:40.339
next Monday.

00:23:40.339 --> 00:23:42.339
So he said, fine, we can go there.

00:23:42.339 --> 00:23:44.339
We can be there at next Monday at 8 a.m.

00:23:44.339 --> 00:23:47.339
And he said, just make sure to bring your things

00:23:47.339 --> 00:23:49.339
to stay two weeks with us.

00:23:49.339 --> 00:23:50.339
Two weeks.

00:23:50.339 --> 00:23:53.339
What was going through your mind when they told you that?

00:23:53.339 --> 00:23:55.339
We actually had no idea.

00:23:55.339 --> 00:23:57.339
They told us a training.

00:23:57.339 --> 00:23:59.339
So we went for two weeks.

00:23:59.339 --> 00:24:00.339
Yes.

00:24:00.339 --> 00:24:03.339
And then at the end of the two weeks,

00:24:03.339 --> 00:24:06.339
they told us the extended for two a month.

00:24:06.339 --> 00:24:09.339
After one month, they extended two months.

00:24:09.339 --> 00:24:12.339
After two months, they extended six months.

00:24:12.339 --> 00:24:16.339
And then when all this happened, I said, wait a minute.

00:24:16.339 --> 00:24:19.339
Two weeks, one month, two months, six months.

00:24:19.339 --> 00:24:23.339
Am I entering Bethel at my mid-40s?

00:24:23.339 --> 00:24:24.339
Yes.

00:24:24.339 --> 00:24:25.339
So it was surprising for us.

00:24:25.339 --> 00:24:26.339
Yes.

00:24:26.339 --> 00:24:28.339
And after six months, maybe I can say that.

00:24:28.339 --> 00:24:31.339
Yes, after six months, we received a letter

00:24:31.339 --> 00:24:34.339
that was our new assignment.

00:24:34.339 --> 00:24:36.339
And we could not believe it.

00:24:36.339 --> 00:24:40.339
I mean, like he said, we had passed that age or reached that age

00:24:40.339 --> 00:24:44.339
where normally you don't start serving at Bethel.

00:24:44.339 --> 00:24:47.339
It's so how long have you been there in the Bethel and Peru?

00:24:47.339 --> 00:24:48.339
It's been six years.

00:24:48.339 --> 00:24:49.339
Six years.

00:24:49.339 --> 00:24:50.339
Yes.

00:24:50.339 --> 00:24:54.339
So how many years then has it been since you left Montreal?

00:24:54.339 --> 00:24:55.339
Almost 10 years.

00:24:55.339 --> 00:24:56.339
10 years.

00:24:56.339 --> 00:24:59.339
Do you think, Brother Papino knew what he was doing when he told you

00:24:59.339 --> 00:25:01.339
to just try it for a year, too?

00:25:01.339 --> 00:25:07.339
He definitely knew the blessings that we were going to enjoy in Peru.

00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:11.339
And I think the best counsel he gave us just to give it a try

00:25:11.339 --> 00:25:15.339
for one year and see how it goes was the best.

00:25:15.339 --> 00:25:18.339
And a whole decade has passed since then.

00:25:18.339 --> 00:25:23.339
When you look back over those life course adjustments,

00:25:23.339 --> 00:25:26.339
how do you feel about the decisions you've made?

00:25:26.339 --> 00:25:30.339
Well, we don't regret any of these decisions.

00:25:30.339 --> 00:25:33.339
We just feel so grateful since the beginning,

00:25:33.339 --> 00:25:37.339
also the way that our both of our families supported us,

00:25:37.339 --> 00:25:43.339
also the examples of brothers like that couple, Jean and Carla Papino,

00:25:43.339 --> 00:25:44.339
everything.

00:25:44.339 --> 00:25:46.339
We've seen how Jehovah has guided us,

00:25:46.339 --> 00:25:51.339
how he has given us blessings that we never foresaw coming.

00:25:52.339 --> 00:25:57.339
And all these new chapters that we added into our lives,

00:25:57.339 --> 00:25:59.339
we are very happy for that.

00:25:59.339 --> 00:26:04.339
Yes, we're very, very grateful to all those,

00:26:04.339 --> 00:26:07.339
the brothers and sisters that helped us along the way.

00:26:07.339 --> 00:26:11.339
And like my wife is saying it, we don't regret it at all.

00:26:11.339 --> 00:26:14.339
And we couldn't do it before.

00:26:14.339 --> 00:26:18.339
But Jehovah knew the specific time.

00:26:19.339 --> 00:26:28.339
Looking back, we can only express our deep appreciation and joy for Jehovah's blessings.

00:26:28.339 --> 00:26:31.339
All praises goes to Jehovah.

00:26:31.339 --> 00:26:37.339
And we're totally convinced that there's never too late to reach out in Jehovah's service.

00:26:37.339 --> 00:26:42.339
Well, we are so proud of you both for making those course adjustments.

00:26:42.339 --> 00:26:47.339
And it's clear that Jehovah has been with you and blessing you along the way.

00:26:47.339 --> 00:26:51.339
Thank you so much for sharing your encouraging story with us.

00:26:51.339 --> 00:26:56.339
And we pray for Jehovah's rich blessing on you as you continue on in your faithful service.

00:26:56.339 --> 00:26:58.339
Thank you for joining us today.

00:26:58.339 --> 00:26:59.339
Thank you.

00:26:59.339 --> 00:27:03.190
Thank you.

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:09.190
So, as you've heard, all four individuals had to make course adjustments,

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:15.190
step out of their comfort zone and take a leap of faith.

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:24.190
Their stories helped us to appreciate that it is never too late to serve Jehovah in new and expanded ways.

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:32.190
And when we take that leap of faith as did these two couples, what would Jehovah do for us?

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:37.190
Recall Jesus' words at Matthew 17, verse 20.

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:41.190
If you have faith the size of a mustard grain,

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:47.190
you will say to this mountain move from here to there, and it will move,

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:51.190
and nothing will be impossible for you.

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:58.190
You see, unlike a book, your story is far from over.

00:27:58.190 --> 00:28:02.190
It is not locked in, finished.

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:07.190
There is still time to make revisions and add new chapters.

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:10.190
And if you take that leap of faith,

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:14.190
Jehovah promises to move mountains,

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:19.190
and nothing will be impossible for you.

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:25.190
We look forward to being with you again on the next edition of the Inside Story.

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:58.940
Well, thank you very much, brother Chilton, and those who joined you in this presentation.

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:01.940
It certainly was very encouraging, wasn't it, for us to see,

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:07.940
and be reminded that it's true, some perhaps start pioneering in the teenage years,

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.940
but then others a little later.

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:13.940
So never feel that you're locked in to a certain decision.

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:16.940
So what a good encouragement that was.
