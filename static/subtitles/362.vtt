00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.620
You know, there are many people today who say that we're not living in the time of the end.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.119
They say the world is just as the same as it's always been.

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:16.620
There's no real changes that have taken place, but of course we know they're deceiving themselves.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:26.120
Never before have so many people around the globe openly practice and flaunted sexual immorality,

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:35.119
and not just among themselves, but they're seeing that it's brought into the homes by means of internet, television, and other means.

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:47.119
Never before has man had the power to decimate entire populations by dropping just one bomb or by means of chemical warfare.

00:00:48.899 --> 00:01:01.399
Never before has there been such widespread lack of love of natural affection that results in the death of children.

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:14.400
It's interesting that some calculate that over one billion abortions have taken place since 1980.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.400
That's really something. That's just about the population of China.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:27.400
If you can imagine, and that is something that's accepted is commonplace in our day.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.900
So some people think, well, things haven't changed, but is that true?

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:42.400
No, quite to the contrary. And something else that we're fully aware of is that people around the earth are making a garbage dump out of the planet that we live on,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:52.400
polluting the air, the seas, the land, and yet some still insist that things haven't changed.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.400
Now, why is it? Why do people have that attitude?

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.400
Well, part of it lies in what the Scriptures tell us, what Paul wrote at 2 Corinthians 4, 3, and 4.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.400
And there it says, Satan blinds the minds of the unbelievers. And the unbelievers are not just atheists.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:20.400
The unbelievers are found throughout the churches of Christendom. They don't really believe what the Bible has to say about prophecy, about morality.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:28.400
That God is really going to clean up this planet and is going to be a wonderful new world of peace and happiness.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:41.400
And so to help people understand these things, we go out and we preach, we tell them about what Matthew 24 says in Mark 13 and Luke 21 and 2 Timothy 3 that we're living in the time of the end.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.400
But there is something we have to remember if we get a little bit discouraged when people don't respond as we feel they should,

00:02:48.400 --> 00:03:00.090
to all of the evidence that we see and we appreciate. The Bible indicates very clearly that many people would not see the sign.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:14.090
They would not accept what the Bible has to say. And what's most interesting about that is that the people who ignore and who deny the sign that we're living in the time of the end are part of the sign themselves.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:32.120
What they do and what the way they think turn to second Peter, second Peter chapter 3 and we'll read verses 3 and 4 in the first line and verse 5.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:45.120
Second Peter 3, 3 and 4 in the first line and verse 5. Peter wrote first of all know this that in the last days, so this is something Peter is saying would happen during our time.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:53.120
Ridiculars will come with their ridicule proceeding according to their own desires and saying where is this promised presence of his?

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:01.120
Why from the day our forefathers fell asleep in death? All things are continuing exactly as they were from creations beginning.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:08.120
And then the reason for it is given in the next line for they deliberately ignore this fact.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:20.120
Well here the fact was they ignored the flood of Noah's day. The fact for us today is that they ignore what the Bible clearly says or what Jesus said would be the sign of the last days.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.120
So they don't realize it, but they're part of the fulfillment.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:31.120
What contributes to an unbelieving attitude? Well one of the things is what we could call his gradualism.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:40.120
The watch tower of January 15, 2014 paragraph 30 or page 30 paragraph 11 stated the following.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.120
It seems that the more familiar a situation is the less people are inclined to pay attention to it.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:55.120
A steady decline in the morality of society in general may seem less shocking than a sudden unexpected change in the behavior of a closer acquaintance.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.120
And then it says nevertheless this gradual decay of morality is dangerous.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:08.120
And isn't it true that most of us have we were raised in an environment that was not so good?

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:18.120
There were immoral things taking place around us, wars, crime, and so people get to the point where they accept it as normal and as it escalates.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:27.120
It really doesn't impress upon him on them that no times have changed. They're becoming far worse than ever before.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:37.120
Gradual decay of morality is dangerous. It makes me think of an illustration about how to boil a frog.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:45.120
If you heat up a pot and you have the water boiling and drop a frog into it, what's going to happen?

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:52.120
He's out of there. He's not going to stay that frog is in stoop and he hits the water and it's terribly hot and out he jumps.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:06:03.120
But if you fill the pot with cool water, drop the frog in and then gradually, little by little you heat it up until it gets to the boiling point.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.120
He's cooked. And that's what's happening in the world today.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:17.120
The gradualism is not perceived by people in the world, but they're being cooked. It's getting hot.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:25.120
And so we know that wicked men are going to continue to increase imposter's scoffing at the truth.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:34.120
World conditions are escalating. They're getting worse constantly, but they're going to have to deal with the creator and his judgment.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:43.120
And there's three Psalms I'd like to just mention briefly that I find very interesting to tie in nicely with the wickedness of the world and what Jehovah will do.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.120
Psalm 10 verse 4.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:55.120
In his hotdiness, the wicked man makes no investigation. All his thoughts are, there is no God.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:04.120
Psalm 12.8. The wicked walk around unrestrained because the sons of men promote depravity.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:11.120
That could have been this morning's headlines in the New York Times. And the last Psalm 92.7.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:20.120
When the wicked sprout like weeds and all the wrongdoers flourish, it is that they may be annihilated forever.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:25.120
And to that we say, Amen. So be it.
