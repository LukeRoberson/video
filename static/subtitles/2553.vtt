All my friends had cell phones and they're like 13 or 14 and it was kind of it was kind of rough growing up

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.460
I go out with my friends and they are talking on their cell phone

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:18.059
They're texting and they're they're doing all types of things and they're like, hey, would your cell phone? Can I have your number?

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:19.899
I don't I don't have one

00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:21.980
You know, it's got a kind of sad story

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.719
Cell phones are so much more than just an actual phone. It's a GPS

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.460
Got a computer in there. You can send emails text messages. I just I love texting

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.380
And my parents would say put it down. Not that I was doing anything wrong, but I was just I was using it so much

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:56.520
It's very easy to get emotionally involved through text messages. For example, you say, oh, I miss you

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.960
No one really wants to say that out loud if you don't really know the person that well

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.520
But you can say it in a text message and you stir up emotions in the other person

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.739
Just through texting you talk to them so much more easily. You could say things that you wouldn't normally say

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:19.620
So it's really up to you on how you choose to communicate with this wonderful tool that you have
