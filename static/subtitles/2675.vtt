00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.849
Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:11.849
Let's consider a few ways this instruction from Jesus benefits us.

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.850
First of all, it highlights that we have a role in sanctifying Jehovah's name.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.850
See, when we express to Jehovah that we want His name to be sanctified,

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.850
we're acknowledging that His name is holy.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.850
We're saying we don't believe the lies that have maligned His name,

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.850
that we know who Jehovah is.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.850
His reputation is something close and dear to our hearts, and we want to defend it.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.850
And Jesus is also reminding us that we have a role in sanctifying Jehovah's name.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.850
Let's highlight that it by going to Isaiah chapter 29.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.850
We can reinforce and see these words for us in Isaiah chapter 29.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.850
And this is a prophecy, notice verse 23.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.849
And Jehovah here is sharing this thought, says,

00:01:06.849 --> 00:01:10.849
for when he sees his children, where the work of my hands in his midst,

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:18.849
they will sanctify my name, and they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob,

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:24.849
and they will stand in awe of the God of Israel.

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:32.849
Yes, we have the privilege to sanctify Jehovah's name or to defend His reputation.

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:39.849
And we do that. We do that in the ministry by telling about Jehovah about His qualities,

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:44.849
which sets aside some of the lies and misconceptions people have about Him.

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:51.849
We also imitate His qualities, which affects our conduct, our speech, our dress and grooming,

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:55.849
and that too glorifies Jehovah.

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:03.849
But what is it that uniquely qualifies us to be able to sanctify Jehovah's name?

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:05.849
Well, notice back there in verse 23, it says,

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:11.849
and they will stand in awe of the God of Israel.

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.849
Yes, because you personally know Jehovah,

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:22.849
because you have a relationship with Him, because you stand in awe of Him,

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.849
you're qualified to defend Him.

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.849
He's answered your prayers.

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:33.849
You've seen how He's guided your steps every day, how He's guided the steps of His people,

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.849
and as a result, as you reflect and meditate on how He's answered your prayers,

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.849
and how He directs His people, it builds within you that zeal

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.849
to sanctify Jehovah's name, to defend His reputation.

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:59.770
A second thing we can learn is these words can help us and not give up in our service to Jehovah.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.770
Let's go back to Matthew chapter 6.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.770
And remember, these words, the model prayer was part of what Jesus was teaching

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.770
and the sermon on the mount, and before He got to the model prayer,

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.770
you notice what He was trying to emphasize for His disciples and for us?

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.770
Notice verse 1, Matthew chapter 6, verse 1.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:19.770
It says,

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.770
Take care not to practice your righteousness in front of men, to be noticed by them.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.770
Otherwise, you'll have no reward with your father, who's in the heavens.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.770
And when you make gifts of mercy, do not blow a trumpet ahead of you

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.770
as hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so they may be glorified by men.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.770
Truly, I say to you, they have the reward in full.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.770
And He goes on to highlight that giving attention to our name,

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.770
or making us prominent, or trying to be too concerned with how we'd look

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:02.770
and appear to others, should not be our focus, as if our name is most important.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.770
And after teaching us that lesson, then He focuses in on verse 9,

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.770
and He shows us what our priority should be.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.770
Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:20.769
So Jesus was helping us see happiness does not come from trying to seek prominence ourselves,

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.769
but by giving priority to Jehovah's name.

00:04:24.769 --> 00:04:30.769
And really, isn't that what has motivated you to serve Jehovah whole soul?

00:04:30.769 --> 00:04:36.769
It's motivated you to pursue a career and full-time service because you've done just that.

00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:42.769
You've heated Jesus instruction, not to promote yourself, not to pursue something

00:04:42.769 --> 00:04:48.769
to bring glory to your name, but to give Jehovah's name priority.

00:04:48.769 --> 00:04:53.769
Now, how could this help us, though, endure in our assignments?

00:04:53.769 --> 00:04:57.769
Well, when we get discouraged, frustrated,

00:04:57.769 --> 00:05:01.769
and maybe we're having a personality conflict with someone,

00:05:01.769 --> 00:05:05.769
or we feel we've been misrepresented, misunderstood.

00:05:05.769 --> 00:05:08.769
There's been an injustice done to us.

00:05:08.769 --> 00:05:13.769
By remembering what's most important, what the priority is,

00:05:13.769 --> 00:05:17.769
and that's the sanctification of Jehovah's name,

00:05:17.769 --> 00:05:24.769
helps us keep things in perspective, helps us put our emotions and our feelings in the proper place,

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:32.769
so we can focus on giving Jehovah glory and not giving up and our service to him.

00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:39.939
We also learn that when we state these words to Jehovah,

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:44.939
that reminds us that Jehovah wants us to draw close to him.

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:50.939
It reminds us that Jehovah is the source of comfort and refreshment.

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:54.939
You see, the sanctify means to make holy.

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:58.939
And as a result, his name, his reputation, who he is,

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:02.939
is held as sacred. He's pure.

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:06.939
His holiness conveys the thought of being clean.

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:13.939
Now, for many, that thought of Jehovah being pure or holy or sacred,

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:17.939
may make them seem distant to us imperfect humans.

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:21.939
And at times, we may even think he's unapproachable,

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:26.939
especially when we struggle with negative feelings about how we view ourselves.

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:31.939
We may find Jehovah's holiness daunting instead of appealing,

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:39.939
that we may even feel that we could never be worthy of drawing close to Jehovah.

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:46.939
However, the truth is, Jehovah's holiness is connected with refreshment.

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:50.939
It's connected with everything that is good.

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:55.939
The draw close to Jehovah book in chapter three used this illustration

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:58.939
to help us see Jehovah's holiness.

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:01.939
How do you feel when you see that picture?

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:04.939
Are you not drawn to it?

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:06.939
Why? Why are you drawn to it?

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:09.939
Because of the clean water, the light,

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:13.939
it looks so refreshing to be there.

00:07:13.939 --> 00:07:17.939
Then the draw close to Jehovah book made this statement.

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:22.939
If the same scene was altered, the stream clogged with garbage,

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:26.939
the trees and rocks to face with graffiti, the air be fouled with smog,

00:07:26.939 --> 00:07:30.939
we would no longer be attracted to it.

00:07:30.939 --> 00:07:37.939
You see, Jehovah's holiness attracts us because it reminds us of his wonderful qualities

00:07:37.939 --> 00:07:41.939
which includes comfort and forgiveness.

00:07:41.939 --> 00:07:46.939
So when we meditate on Jehovah's holiness, it draws us to us.

00:07:46.939 --> 00:07:49.939
And when we deal with negative feelings,

00:07:49.939 --> 00:07:52.939
we don't want to think Jehovah is unapproachable,

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:55.939
or he doesn't want to hear from us.

00:07:55.939 --> 00:07:57.939
The opposite is true.

00:07:57.939 --> 00:08:02.939
In fact, notice how that's brought out in Psalm 103.

00:08:02.939 --> 00:08:05.939
Psalm 103, here David in verse one,

00:08:05.939 --> 00:08:08.939
he says, let everything within me praise what?

00:08:08.939 --> 00:08:10.939
His holy name.

00:08:10.939 --> 00:08:14.939
I know this was connected with that holy name in verse 13 and 14.

00:08:14.939 --> 00:08:19.939
Says as a father shows mercy to his sons,

00:08:19.939 --> 00:08:24.939
Jehovah, the holy one, has shown mercy to those who fear him.

00:08:24.939 --> 00:08:30.939
For he well knows how we're formed, remembering that we are dust.

00:08:30.939 --> 00:08:35.940
See, Jehovah's holiness reminds us of his mercy,

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.940
his compassion for us,

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.940
is as if he's saying, I know you've made mistakes.

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.940
And I know you're imperfect, but I understand you.

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.940
And whenever you feel like you can approach me,

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.940
or you're overwhelmed with negative emotions,

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.940
he's saying, I understand, come to me.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:59.940
Yes, his holiness attracts us to him.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.940
His holiness is a source of refreshment.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.940
So our words today, our Father in the heavens,

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.940
let your name be sanctified,

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.940
it reminds us that we have the privilege

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.940
to defend Jehovah's reputation

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.940
because we personally know him.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.940
It helps us to continue in our service to him

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.940
and not to give up.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:31.940
It also reminds us that Jehovah is the source of refreshment

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.940
at place we want to run to.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.940
And we're going to run to.
