00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.299
Hi, I'm Taylor, and this is Iron, Sharpen's Iron.

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:18.839
Today, we're going to practice how to start a conversation that could lead to a witness.

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:22.839
Now, for many, this can be terrifying.

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:23.839
Why?

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:29.320
Well, as soon as we see someone that we'd like to talk to, we can start to think to ourselves,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.839
what am I going to say?

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:32.439
How am I going to give a witness?

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.240
Or how are they going to react?

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.280
And we can become so overwhelmed with anxiety or nerves, thinking about how the conversation

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.880
will end that we never even start.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.119
So here's something that we must keep in mind.

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:52.759
Our goal is simply to start a conversation.

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:56.000
So if we've started a conversation, we've succeeded.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We've reached our goal.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.320
Then we can just relax and see if it leads to a witness.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:11.680
The September 2018 life and ministry meeting workbook shows us how we can start a conversation

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.359
like Jesus did with the Samaritan woman in John chapter 4.

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:21.719
So when we see someone that we would like to talk to, we want to keep these three steps

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:23.719
in mind.

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:27.840
Number one, be friendly.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.000
That's it.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Just be friendly.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.560
So we can be nervous, so we can say quick prayer to Jehovah to give us courage, but then

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.760
we can give a friendly greeting.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.040
Then we can mention something that's happening right then and there.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.879
Maybe the weather, the long line at the grocery store, their nice car, or another genuine

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:49.879
compliment.

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:54.840
Jesus, when he started his conversation in verse 7 with the Samaritan woman, he simply

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.280
said, and no doubt in a friendly way, give me a drink.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.879
Step two, let the conversation progress naturally.

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:07.840
Don't rush it.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.319
If the conversation ends before we're able to give a witness, it's okay.

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.400
We accomplished our goal.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.439
We started a conversation.

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:17.240
Now we're ready to try again.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.879
Now, if the conversation continues on, then we can look for an opportunity to take step

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.199
three.

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:28.439
Make a simple expression of our faith.

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:35.199
One of verses after Jesus started the conversation with the Samaritan woman, then he witnessed

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:36.199
to her.

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:39.919
He said he had water that imparts everlasting life.

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:43.639
But between those two points, he didn't lecture her.

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:49.439
He let her talk and express herself and he listened to what she had to say.

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:53.479
So with those three steps in mind, now it's our turn.

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:59.560
It's our turn to practice starting a conversation that could lead to a witness.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.879
Now tied in with us, we have Taís and Karolina who have joined us for a demonstration.

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:09.360
So where are you going to try to start your conversation today?

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.759
We are in a department store.

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:15.280
Yes, we are in a Portuguese congregation and it's common to hear people speak Portuguese

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.000
when they're now shopping.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Excellent.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.800
So you've heard the three steps that we want to try.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.240
At first, let's see what could happen if we rushed the conversation.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.240
Okay.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.080
Wait a little bit.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.560
I heard you speak in Portuguese.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.560
Where are you from?

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.560
Oi, I'm from Rio de Janeiro.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.719
I'm from São Paulo.

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:35.120
How long have you been here?

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.639
Just three months.

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.680
It's so hard to just, isn't it?

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.159
You know, the Bible helped me so much when I moved here.

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.759
I don't want to keep you from your shopping, but you can read the Bible in Portuguese on

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:49.280
our website and it has articles I know you'll find comforting.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.439
Okay, so time out.

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:54.360
Now, Tais, we know you rushed that on purpose.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.520
But how did it make you feel when you did?

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.120
Yeah, it didn't feel right.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.919
She started when it's so quickly and I thought she wasn't expecting it.

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:02.919
Right.

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:03.919
And Catalina, how about you?

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.400
How did it make you feel?

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.360
It started okay, but then got awkward real fast.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.360
Right.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.560
So now maybe you can show us what it's like when the conversation will progress more naturally.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.560
Okay.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.040
Oi, to the bang.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.879
I heard just picking Portuguese.

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:20.959
Why are you from?

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.480
Oi, I'm from Rio de Janeiro.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.319
Oh, nice.

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:25.600
I'm from São Paulo.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.319
I recognize your accent.

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:28.519
I'm Tais.

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:29.560
I'm Catalina.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.079
Nice to meet you.

00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:33.240
Wow, how long have you been here?

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.519
Only three months.

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:40.680
Well, for me, it's been three years and the first was the hardest.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.480
Yes, we finally have work, but we are still looking for a place to live.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.519
And immigration has been harder than we thought.

00:04:48.519 --> 00:04:50.680
Wow, I'm so sorry.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.600
Do you have family with you?

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.800
My husband.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.040
We had to live our son with my mother.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.160
I miss him so much.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.120
Wow, that's so hard.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.560
But we have to keep trusting in God.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.920
In my case is what got me through.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.759
I know.

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:09.360
But I still worry when I don't know what he'll do for us.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.199
Okay, so let's stop there.

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:13.240
Really nice, thank you.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.439
So Tais, where do you feel the conversation is at at this point?

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:20.720
Yeah, I feel like I found a good time to say something about my faith.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.680
And now she's seeing how she feels.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.319
Nice, excellent.

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:26.800
And Catalina, how about you?

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.920
It was just a nice conversation.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.040
So when she mentioned God was not awkward.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.439
Thank you, sisters, for letting us learn from your conversation.

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:40.360
I found that helpful, and I hope you did too.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.959
And make it your goal to start conversations with those three steps.

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:51.959
Be friendly, converse naturally, and find the right time to express your faith.

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:57.560
Practice at home, or with a friend, and see for yourself how iron sharpens iron.
