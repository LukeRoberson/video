WEBVTT

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:07.200
We extend our warm welcome to all of you.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.199
We're so happy to have you join us for this month's broadcast.

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:18.199
Here's a little sample of what will be contained in our program.

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:24.199
Proverbs 3.5 tells us to trust in Jehovah with all our heart.

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.199
We'll see how three brothers facing different challenges

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.200
overcame them by trusting in Jehovah completely.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.200
Though personal attacks may start small, being bullied

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.200
can quickly make you feel alone and worth this wondering why me?

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.200
In this month's My Teen Life, we'll hear how Charlie and Farron

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:55.200
learned a cope with bullies and grew stronger and more confident as a result.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.200
And in a new dramatization, we'll reconnect with two dear friends,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.200
Nita and Jade and see how they remain loyal when confronted

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.200
with false reports about the truth.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.200
Yes, there's much to look forward to.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:21.200
In the September 2022 edition of JW Broadcasting,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:48.150
the theme for this program is as Jehovah sheep reject the voice of strangers.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:54.150
It's estimated that there may be 15 million animal species on earth today.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.150
But of all these animals, which one is most often used in the Bible

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:06.150
to represent good people? Sheep. Jesus often uses illustration.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.150
Here are three examples. First, to his twelve apostles,

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:18.150
he said at Matthew 10.16, I am sending you out as sheep among wolves.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.150
Second, regarding what he'll do shortly before Armageddon,

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.150
he said at Matthew 25.32 and 33 that he will separate people

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:35.150
one from another just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.150
In subsequent verses, he describes how the sheep will inherit everlasting life.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.150
But the goats will depart into everlasting destruction.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.150
Our third example, Jesus said, at John 10.16,

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.150
I have other sheep which are not of this fold.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.150
Those two I must bring in and they will listen to my voice

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.150
and they will become one flock, one shepherd.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.150
But a question arises, why did Jesus use a sheep illustration

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.150
to represent people who will gain everlasting life?

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.150
Undoubtedly, because of the desirable qualities literal sheep have.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.150
They're gregarious, having a liking for companionship.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.150
They don't like to be alone.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.150
And it's a good thing, because without the flock in the protection of the shepherd,

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.150
they're defenseless if a lion or bear approaches.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.150
About all they can do is bleat.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.780
Goodbye, little sheep.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.780
Another good quality is that sheep has a whole tend to be peaceful,

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.780
inoffensive, very different from goats.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.780
As little boys, my brother and I would pet the goats that my grandfather had.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.780
But if we turned our backs on them, one would often sneak up behind us

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.780
and but us for no reason.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.780
These are some of the desirable characteristics that make sheep

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.779
an appropriate illustration for good people.

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:22.779
But the quality we especially want to focus on

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:28.779
is identified at John chapter 10, verses 4 and 5.

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:33.779
When he, that is the shepherd, has brought all his own out,

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:35.779
he goes ahead of them.

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:40.779
And the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:45.779
They will, by no means, follow a stranger, but will flee from him,

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:51.779
because they do not know the voice of strangers.

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:54.779
So what's the desirable quality?

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:57.779
Sheep listened to the voice of their shepherd

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:00.779
and reject the voice of strangers.

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:03.779
Regarding this quality of sheep,

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:07.779
the Septimifers 2004 watchtower said this.

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:12.779
A book on Bible lands relates that a visitor once claimed

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:17.779
that sheep recognize their shepherd by his dress, not his voice.

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:20.779
A shepherd answered that it was the voice they knew.

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:24.779
To prove this, he exchanged clothing with a stranger.

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:29.779
Dressed in the shepherd's garb, the stranger called the sheep,

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:31.779
but they did not respond.

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:34.779
They did not know his voice.

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:38.779
Yet when the shepherd called them, though he was disguised,

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:42.779
the sheep came at once.

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:44.779
Please ask yourself,

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:47.779
as one of Jehovah's figurative sheep,

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:51.779
do I obediently respond to the voice of the fine shepherd

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:54.779
and flee from the voice of strangers?

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:56.779
Well, let's talk about this.

00:05:56.779 --> 00:06:00.779
The original stranger was Satan the Devil.

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:05.779
Like a ventriloquist, he made a serpent appear to top,

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:08.779
but the words were Satan's words.

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:16.779
Satan thereby used his voice to slander Jehovah and deceive Eve.

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:20.779
Today, Satan continues his work as an evil ventriloquist

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:24.779
using not serpents, but human puppets

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:29.779
to enunciate his voice these acting as his agents,

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:33.779
either wittingly or unwittingly.

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:38.779
But now, let's discuss three examples of how a fine shepherd

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:43.779
tells us one thing, but Satan's underlings or strangers

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:46.779
tell us something opposite.

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:52.779
We must be vigilant to listen to the right voice.

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:57.779
Our fine shepherd tells us, as our first example,

00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:04.779
these words at Matthew chapter 24, verses 45 to 47,

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:09.779
who really is the fateful and discreet slave

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:13.779
whom his master appointed over his domestics

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:16.779
to give them their food at the proper time.

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:22.779
Happy is that slave if his master on a coming finds him doing so?

00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:29.779
Truly I say to you, he will appoint him over all his belongings.

00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:34.779
We know the master Jesus found the fateful and discreet slave

00:07:34.779 --> 00:07:38.779
spiritually feeding right-hearted ones in 1919.

00:07:39.779 --> 00:07:45.779
And at a future time, we'll appoint him over all his belongings.

00:07:45.779 --> 00:07:48.779
So what's the implication?

00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:54.779
Obviously, even now, Jesus fully trusts the fateful slave.

00:07:54.779 --> 00:07:59.779
And all of us, even individual members of the governing body,

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:02.779
should do the same.

00:08:02.779 --> 00:08:06.779
But what does the voice of strangers say on this subject?

00:08:06.779 --> 00:08:09.779
Don't trust the fateful slave.

00:08:09.779 --> 00:08:11.779
He will mislead you.

00:08:11.779 --> 00:08:17.779
And who often have the loudest voice promoting this false message?

00:08:17.779 --> 00:08:19.779
Upostates.

00:08:19.779 --> 00:08:26.779
Hebrews 139 labels false messages as strange teachings.

00:08:26.779 --> 00:08:30.779
Yes, they are the teachings of strangers.

00:08:30.779 --> 00:08:33.779
Some examples of their strange teachings

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:38.779
are that the fateful slave protects pedophiles.

00:08:38.779 --> 00:08:44.779
Or that slave will exploit you so they can live lives of luxury.

00:08:44.779 --> 00:08:51.779
Those are both bald-faced lies.

00:08:51.779 --> 00:08:57.779
Acts 2030 says that apostate speak twisted things.

00:08:57.779 --> 00:09:01.779
They do this in order to draw God's sheep away

00:09:01.779 --> 00:09:04.779
and make them followers of themselves.

00:09:04.779 --> 00:09:10.779
Something that's twisted is been out of shape or distorted.

00:09:10.779 --> 00:09:15.779
They speak twisted things by leaving out vital details,

00:09:15.779 --> 00:09:17.779
taking things out of context.

00:09:17.779 --> 00:09:22.779
Or in some other way manipulating a truth into a lie

00:09:22.779 --> 00:09:27.779
or into a misleading half-truth.

00:09:27.779 --> 00:09:30.779
Second Peter 2.3 says,

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:36.779
they will greedily exploit you with counterfeit words.

00:09:36.779 --> 00:09:41.779
A counterfeit is something that's carefully designed to look like the real thing.

00:09:41.779 --> 00:09:44.779
Take, for example, counterfeit money.

00:09:44.779 --> 00:09:49.779
It might look genuine, but it's fake and thus worthless.

00:09:49.779 --> 00:09:54.779
If we're deceived into accepting it, we'll lose money.

00:09:54.779 --> 00:09:59.779
But if we're deceived into accepting the counterfeit words of apostate,

00:09:59.779 --> 00:10:03.779
we'll lose our life.

00:10:03.779 --> 00:10:09.779
And apostates will give us absolutely nothing of value in exchange.

00:10:09.779 --> 00:10:15.779
Can you imagine really needing a loving, shepherding visit?

00:10:15.779 --> 00:10:20.639
And asking apostates to give you one?

00:10:20.639 --> 00:10:25.639
Similarly, we must be careful about believing everything presented in the media

00:10:25.639 --> 00:10:28.639
about Jehovah's organization.

00:10:28.639 --> 00:10:33.639
Remember, the media is commonly motivated by prejudice, hatred,

00:10:33.639 --> 00:10:35.639
and a desire for profit.

00:10:35.639 --> 00:10:42.639
False and exaggerated news reports are very common.

00:10:42.639 --> 00:10:46.639
For example, in one European country, many people were indignant

00:10:46.639 --> 00:10:51.639
when an emotional press report stated that a young female witness died

00:10:51.639 --> 00:10:55.639
because she refused a blood transfusion.

00:10:55.639 --> 00:10:58.639
Were those the complete facts?

00:10:58.639 --> 00:11:00.639
No.

00:11:00.639 --> 00:11:04.639
The patient refused a blood transfusion on religious grounds,

00:11:04.639 --> 00:11:10.639
but she did agree to alternative non-blood medical management.

00:11:10.639 --> 00:11:13.639
This could have been implemented immediately,

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:16.639
and likely would have saved her life.

00:11:16.639 --> 00:11:24.639
However, the hospital delayed matters unnecessarily until it was too late.

00:11:24.639 --> 00:11:30.299
The press report didn't mention these facts.

00:11:30.299 --> 00:11:36.299
While it's unreasonable to distrust all secular sources of information,

00:11:36.299 --> 00:11:38.299
we must be wary.

00:11:38.299 --> 00:11:41.299
First John 5.19 says,

00:11:41.299 --> 00:11:47.299
The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.

00:11:47.299 --> 00:11:55.029
Now, let's discuss a second example of the voice of our fine shepher Jesus.

00:11:55.029 --> 00:12:01.029
Matthew chapter 5 verses 27 and 28.

00:12:01.029 --> 00:12:03.029
Jesus said,

00:12:03.029 --> 00:12:08.029
You heard that it was said you must not commit adultery.

00:12:08.029 --> 00:12:13.029
But I say to you that everyone who keeps on looking at a woman

00:12:13.029 --> 00:12:20.029
so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.

00:12:20.029 --> 00:12:26.029
Our fine shepherd is telling us not only to avoid sexual immorality,

00:12:26.029 --> 00:12:33.029
but also to flee from anything that could lead to it, such as immoral thoughts.

00:12:33.029 --> 00:12:39.029
And at Matthew 19.9, our fine shepherd tells us,

00:12:39.029 --> 00:12:46.029
I say to you that whoever divorces his wife except on the grounds of sexual immorality

00:12:46.029 --> 00:12:51.029
and marries another commits adultery.

00:12:51.029 --> 00:12:58.029
Here Jesus makes clear that the only valid basis for divorce and remarriage in God's eyes

00:12:58.029 --> 00:13:04.029
is if a disloyal mate commits sexual immorality.

00:13:04.029 --> 00:13:09.029
But what's the voice of strangers of Satan's world telling us regarding divorce,

00:13:09.029 --> 00:13:14.029
adultery, and other forms of sexual immorality?

00:13:14.029 --> 00:13:18.029
No problem. It's your choice.

00:13:18.029 --> 00:13:23.029
You have the freedom to do what you want.

00:13:23.029 --> 00:13:28.029
In fact, in order to make sexual immorality appear more innocent,

00:13:28.029 --> 00:13:31.029
it's often euphemized.

00:13:31.029 --> 00:13:39.029
Sexual perversion, such as homosexuality, is called an alternative lifestyle.

00:13:39.029 --> 00:13:42.029
One so-called expert said,

00:13:42.029 --> 00:13:45.029
it's simply like being left-handed.

00:13:45.029 --> 00:13:50.029
Pornography is called adult entertainment.

00:13:50.029 --> 00:13:59.029
Adulterous betrayal of one's marriage mate is called having an affair.

00:13:59.029 --> 00:14:07.029
Many call getting married old-fashioned and see nothing wrong with living together without marriage.

00:14:07.029 --> 00:14:15.029
And this world's media is very skillful at presenting something bad as good.

00:14:15.029 --> 00:14:22.029
For example, in a movie, a female character might be portrayed as having a husband who is abusive.

00:14:22.029 --> 00:14:26.029
You like the woman, and you want her to find happiness.

00:14:26.029 --> 00:14:33.029
Then a handsome man starts working in her office, and he's so nice to her.

00:14:33.029 --> 00:14:41.029
There's an attraction between them, and the budding romance is presented as something good.

00:14:41.029 --> 00:14:48.029
Soft background music makes it hard to consider her course to be bad.

00:14:48.029 --> 00:14:56.029
It's easy to keep watching, and hope she leaves her marriage mate and runs off with a workmate.

00:14:56.029 --> 00:14:59.029
And usually that's what happens.

00:14:59.029 --> 00:15:08.029
So easily we can forget that Jehovah and Jesus hate adultery and unscriptural divorce.

00:15:08.029 --> 00:15:17.029
But when we reject the voice of this world and listen to the voice of Jehovah and Jesus,

00:15:17.029 --> 00:15:24.029
we bring protection and blessings to ourselves and others.

00:15:24.029 --> 00:15:31.029
But now our third example of the voice of our fine shepherd is at Matthew 6,

00:15:31.029 --> 00:15:36.029
and we're going to read verses 19 and 20.

00:15:37.029 --> 00:15:44.029
Stop storing up for yourselves treasures on the earth, where moth and rust consume,

00:15:44.029 --> 00:15:47.029
and where thieves break in and steal.

00:15:47.029 --> 00:15:55.029
Rather, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes,

00:15:55.029 --> 00:15:59.029
and where thieves do not break in and steal.

00:16:00.029 --> 00:16:07.029
We're told that our focus should be on spiritual things and not on physical things.

00:16:07.029 --> 00:16:13.029
And this is especially true when thinking about where we are in the stream of time,

00:16:13.029 --> 00:16:19.029
in the final part of the final part of the last days.

00:16:19.029 --> 00:16:25.029
But what's the voice of strangers of this world on this subject?

00:16:25.029 --> 00:16:32.029
Exert yourself vigorously to acquire material possessions.

00:16:32.029 --> 00:16:41.029
Pursue things that will make your life comfortable, because that is what will bring you happiness.

00:16:41.029 --> 00:16:45.029
The question is, to whom are we listening?

00:16:45.029 --> 00:16:52.029
Jehovah and Jesus tell us to be content now with a spiritual paradise,

00:16:52.029 --> 00:17:01.029
and to concentrate on our lifesaving preaching work, and that they will provide a physical paradise later.

00:17:01.029 --> 00:17:09.029
First Peter 2.11 indicates that we should view ourselves as temporary residents,

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:16.029
who are just passing through this old system and headed for the real life in the new world.

00:17:16.029 --> 00:17:20.029
What do we mean by temporary resident?

00:17:20.029 --> 00:17:27.029
Imagine that you rent an old house to live in, while a new, beautiful house is being built for you.

00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:30.029
You'll live there only a few months.

00:17:30.029 --> 00:17:34.029
Would you install a new concrete driveway?

00:17:34.029 --> 00:17:38.029
Would you put in new electrical wiring and plumbing?

00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:41.029
Would you install brand new vinyl siding?

00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:43.029
No!

00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:50.029
You might do a few cosmetic things to make your stay a little more comfortable, but you wouldn't do anything major.

00:17:50.029 --> 00:18:01.029
Why? Because you know you're just a temporary resident, and that soon you'll move into your beautiful new home.

00:18:01.029 --> 00:18:12.029
Well, if we think of ourselves, just as temporary residents in this old system, it'll be a real protection against the materialism

00:18:12.029 --> 00:18:17.029
that is promoted by the voice of strangers.

00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:22.029
We've now discussed three examples of Jesus' voice.

00:18:22.029 --> 00:18:28.029
Number one, trust the fateful and discreet slave.

00:18:28.029 --> 00:18:34.029
Two, reject sexual immorality and unscriptural divorce.

00:18:34.029 --> 00:18:42.029
Three, focus on storing up spiritual treasures rather than material treasures.

00:18:42.029 --> 00:18:53.029
Of course, there are many other examples of these two different voices, but may we all be vigilant to listen to the right voice.

00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:58.029
Of Jesus, Jehovah Himself said,

00:18:58.029 --> 00:19:03.029
This is my son, the beloved, whom I have approved.

00:19:03.029 --> 00:19:06.029
Listen to him.

00:19:06.029 --> 00:19:17.029
But in order to do so obediently as Jehovah's sheep, we must reject the voice of strangers.

00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:24.029
But how would you handle things if the voice of strangers was brought to you by someone close?

00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:28.029
A friend, or perhaps even a family member.

00:19:28.029 --> 00:19:34.029
That's what Jade faces in the following dramatization.

00:19:34.029 --> 00:20:09.450
How will she learn to reject the voice of strangers in a sensitive situation?

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:10.450
Amen.

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:12.450
Smells wonderful.

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:15.450
Oh, wait, of course.

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:17.450
You should cook every night.

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:20.450
If you clean every night?

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:24.450
No, we'll take it in turns.

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:27.450
But this looks amazing.

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:28.450
Thanks.

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:31.450
It's a practice for my first guest.

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:32.450
Really? Who?

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:34.450
My mum.

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:36.450
That's wonderful.

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:43.450
We had our first phone call in a year that wasn't a total disaster, so I invited her around tomorrow.

00:20:43.450 --> 00:21:10.730
It'll go great.

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:11.730
Hi, mum.

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:13.730
Hello, love.

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:15.730
Come in.

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.730
Nice to see you.

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:19.730
Nice to see you too.

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:20.730
Yeah, we take that.

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:22.730
Oh, thanks, and I love you.

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:34.940
You're roommates.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.940
You say the explorer is.

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.940
The pioneers.

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:44.940
They preach full-time, but they work part-time.

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.940
I see.

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:47.940
But you?

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:48.940
No.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:49.940
Not yet anyway.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:55.299
Jade love.

00:21:55.299 --> 00:21:57.299
All this.

00:21:57.299 --> 00:22:00.299
I see it's made to a better person.

00:22:00.299 --> 00:22:02.299
Heaven knows I tried.

00:22:02.299 --> 00:22:06.859
But I miss bits of the old Jade.

00:22:06.859 --> 00:22:08.859
Bits.

00:22:08.859 --> 00:22:10.859
What bits?

00:22:10.859 --> 00:22:20.009
Where's the Jade that questioned everything?

00:22:20.009 --> 00:22:24.009
So then, she pulls out her phone, start showing me stuff about witnesses.

00:22:24.009 --> 00:22:25.009
What kind of stuff?

00:22:25.009 --> 00:22:29.009
News, stories, all negative and slanted.

00:22:29.009 --> 00:22:33.009
I tried to change the subject, but she just kept out of it.

00:22:33.009 --> 00:22:34.009
See you later, girls.

00:22:34.009 --> 00:22:35.009
Oh, bye.

00:22:35.009 --> 00:22:36.009
My pleasure.

00:22:36.009 --> 00:22:38.009
Sorry, I am.

00:22:38.009 --> 00:23:05.150
I gotta get ready.

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:09.259
Oh, how long are you gonna be gone for?

00:23:09.259 --> 00:23:20.779
I told my daughter it's too hot here for me.

00:23:20.779 --> 00:23:22.779
Been better.

00:23:22.779 --> 00:23:25.779
I need to say that your mother visited.

00:23:25.779 --> 00:23:27.779
I hope you don't mind.

00:23:27.779 --> 00:23:28.779
No.

00:23:28.779 --> 00:23:30.779
Mum's driving me mad.

00:23:30.779 --> 00:23:38.769
It's like it's her hobby to ruin my life.

00:23:38.769 --> 00:23:41.049
And my daughter got back.

00:23:41.049 --> 00:23:48.460
You opposed your daughter.

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:51.900
And didn't want to lose her.

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:52.900
I'm not going anywhere.

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:56.900
Of course not, but a worried mother doesn't know that.

00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:05.470
I got to go over scripture for you.

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:13.470
When you read it, remember, your mum is not the stranger.

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:16.470
John chapter 10 and verse 5.

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:23.630
They will by no means follow a stranger,

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:26.630
but will flee from him,

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:35.559
because they do not know the voice of strangers.

00:24:35.559 --> 00:24:38.559
Mum is not the stranger.

00:24:38.559 --> 00:24:40.559
It's what she shares.

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:48.740
We check the voice.

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:54.900
Not bad.

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:56.900
Did you look at those links that I sent you?

00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:02.000
Mum.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
I want us to get together,

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000
but I won't hear anything negative about my beliefs.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.039
Perhaps we just won't talk religion.

00:25:13.039 --> 00:25:14.039
Is it deal then?

00:25:14.039 --> 00:25:15.039
All right then.

00:25:15.039 --> 00:25:17.039
I can see I'm not going to get anywhere.

00:25:17.039 --> 00:25:19.039
So what subject do you want to talk about?

00:25:19.039 --> 00:25:26.130
The deal fell apart.

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:28.130
Fast.

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:31.299
Jade.

00:25:31.299 --> 00:25:33.299
I know we weren't going to talk religion,

00:25:33.299 --> 00:25:36.299
but I must tell you this one thing that I read.

00:25:36.299 --> 00:25:37.299
Mum.

00:25:37.299 --> 00:25:39.299
I thought we weren't going to talk about this.

00:25:39.299 --> 00:25:46.299
Just getting late.

00:25:46.299 --> 00:25:47.299
I'm going to go.

00:25:47.299 --> 00:25:52.819
Thanks for dinner.

00:25:52.819 --> 00:25:53.819
I'll quit tomorrow.

00:25:53.819 --> 00:26:14.019
Jade, I got an alert this morning,

00:26:14.019 --> 00:26:15.019
and I'm really confused about this.

00:26:15.019 --> 00:26:16.019
Mum's about this.

00:26:16.019 --> 00:26:17.019
No, I don't mind.

00:26:17.019 --> 00:26:20.019
I was sure this wouldn't work.

00:26:20.019 --> 00:26:25.160
It happened.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.160
Jade.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.920
I'd like to change our agreement.

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.920
If I ask you what you believe,

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.920
you get to answer.

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:40.799
Sure answers, I won't be converting.

00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:45.259
Is the deal then?

00:26:45.259 --> 00:26:47.259
Yeah, it's a deal.

00:26:47.259 --> 00:27:01.339
How wise it was for Jade to distinguish

00:27:01.339 --> 00:27:04.339
between the dangerous falsehoods

00:27:04.339 --> 00:27:06.339
about Jehovah's people

00:27:06.339 --> 00:27:10.339
and the person unwittingly promoting them.

00:27:10.339 --> 00:27:12.339
Jade took a clear stand,

00:27:12.339 --> 00:27:15.339
but she also patiently showed

00:27:15.339 --> 00:27:18.339
that she loved her mother.

00:27:18.339 --> 00:27:20.339
This not only protected Jade

00:27:20.339 --> 00:27:22.339
from dangerous thinking,

00:27:22.339 --> 00:27:24.339
but also helped her mother.

00:27:24.339 --> 00:27:26.339
Unfortunately,

00:27:26.339 --> 00:27:29.339
as our children grow in a 10-school,

00:27:29.339 --> 00:27:32.339
many face a modern scourge.

00:27:32.339 --> 00:27:34.339
Buying.

00:27:35.339 --> 00:27:37.339
How can they overcome the fear

00:27:37.339 --> 00:27:39.339
and negative feelings

00:27:39.339 --> 00:27:42.339
that being bullied causes?

00:27:42.339 --> 00:27:45.339
We'll listen to two of our teenagers share

00:27:45.339 --> 00:27:47.339
what worked for them

00:27:47.339 --> 00:27:58.660
in this addition of my teen life.

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:00.660
My experience with bullying

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:03.660
ultimately started in physical education.

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:06.660
When this kid who shared a locker

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:08.660
or a few spaces away from me

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:09.660
took that opportunity

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.660
to verbally attack me.

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:13.660
I first experienced bullying

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:15.660
in elementary school,

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:17.660
but it was a little stuff.

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:19.660
Nothing too big.

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:20.660
In middle school,

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:23.660
it was really, really something.

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:27.329
It was upsetting

00:28:27.329 --> 00:28:29.329
that I was being bullied.

00:28:29.329 --> 00:28:31.329
It made me feel like

00:28:31.329 --> 00:28:33.329
I was doing something wrong.

00:28:33.329 --> 00:28:37.329
Why did I have to be the target?

00:28:37.329 --> 00:28:39.329
It got really personal.

00:28:39.329 --> 00:28:40.329
They told me names.

00:28:40.329 --> 00:28:42.329
He would say that

00:28:42.329 --> 00:28:43.329
it wasn't good at anything.

00:28:43.329 --> 00:28:44.329
They would care about me,

00:28:44.329 --> 00:28:45.329
that I was dumb,

00:28:45.329 --> 00:28:46.329
that I was weak.

00:28:46.329 --> 00:28:47.329
Especially after he found out

00:28:47.329 --> 00:28:48.329
that I was a witness

00:28:48.329 --> 00:28:50.329
and the text just got even more intense.

00:28:50.329 --> 00:28:52.329
There was one day specifically

00:28:52.329 --> 00:28:53.329
that was really bad.

00:28:53.329 --> 00:28:55.329
It started in a classroom.

00:28:55.329 --> 00:28:58.329
I heard one girl talk to another girl

00:28:58.329 --> 00:29:01.329
about me right in front of me.

00:29:01.329 --> 00:29:02.329
And these were lies.

00:29:02.329 --> 00:29:03.329
We went to lunch

00:29:03.329 --> 00:29:05.329
and I was cornered again.

00:29:05.329 --> 00:29:08.329
Is this how middle school is going to be?

00:29:08.329 --> 00:29:10.329
I don't have anybody to be with

00:29:10.329 --> 00:29:12.329
to hang out with during school.

00:29:12.329 --> 00:29:14.329
Because everybody doesn't like me.

00:29:14.329 --> 00:29:16.329
I felt no one like me.

00:29:16.329 --> 00:29:18.329
It was the worst day ever.

00:29:18.329 --> 00:29:22.329
I no longer felt that I was valuable at that point.

00:29:22.329 --> 00:29:24.329
I was starting to feel more

00:29:24.329 --> 00:29:26.329
that I was this weak person.

00:29:26.329 --> 00:29:28.329
That I was defenseless

00:29:28.329 --> 00:29:30.329
and that I had no one cared about me

00:29:30.329 --> 00:29:32.329
and that I was worthless to anybody.

00:29:32.329 --> 00:29:34.329
So hearing that over and over

00:29:34.329 --> 00:29:36.329
really took a toll on my mental health

00:29:36.329 --> 00:29:37.329
and my emotional health.

00:29:37.329 --> 00:29:39.329
I think of my lowest point

00:29:39.329 --> 00:29:41.329
after receiving so many of these vicious attacks.

00:29:41.329 --> 00:29:43.329
I started to have really, really dark feelings

00:29:43.329 --> 00:29:45.329
and I realized that I

00:29:45.329 --> 00:29:47.329
shouldn't let this go any further

00:29:47.329 --> 00:29:49.329
than it already is.

00:29:49.329 --> 00:29:51.329
That was the moment when I knew I had to get help.

00:29:51.329 --> 00:29:53.329
I told my parents about it of course

00:29:53.329 --> 00:29:55.329
and especially on the worst day

00:29:55.329 --> 00:29:57.329
I told them everything.

00:29:57.329 --> 00:29:59.329
My parents always brought up scriptures.

00:29:59.329 --> 00:30:01.329
Proverbs 27-12.

00:30:01.329 --> 00:30:03.329
Anytime I saw the bullies

00:30:03.329 --> 00:30:05.329
I would avoid as much as possible.

00:30:05.329 --> 00:30:07.329
Another thing that I was always doing

00:30:07.329 --> 00:30:09.329
was praying constantly.

00:30:09.329 --> 00:30:11.329
Always praying.

00:30:11.329 --> 00:30:13.329
Before school, during school,

00:30:13.329 --> 00:30:15.329
after school,

00:30:15.329 --> 00:30:17.329
there were times that would go into the library

00:30:17.329 --> 00:30:19.329
and just read books,

00:30:19.329 --> 00:30:21.329
just stayed in myself.

00:30:21.329 --> 00:30:23.329
During those times I would also pray

00:30:23.329 --> 00:30:25.329
to Jehovah and he was a friend to me.

00:30:25.329 --> 00:30:27.329
He was somebody that I could speak to

00:30:27.329 --> 00:30:29.329
on this matter.

00:30:29.329 --> 00:30:31.329
I did end up talking to my parents about it.

00:30:31.329 --> 00:30:33.329
They let me get my side of the story out.

00:30:33.329 --> 00:30:35.329
They were listening and they wanted to help out.

00:30:35.329 --> 00:30:39.329
And they made me feel loved.

00:30:39.329 --> 00:30:41.329
I definitely took this time

00:30:41.329 --> 00:30:43.329
to reach out to the elders

00:30:43.329 --> 00:30:45.329
and they really encouraged me

00:30:45.329 --> 00:30:47.329
and assured me that

00:30:47.329 --> 00:30:49.329
that I was not only somewhere

00:30:49.329 --> 00:30:51.329
where I was needed.

00:30:51.329 --> 00:30:53.329
I was also somewhere where I was wanted.

00:30:53.329 --> 00:30:55.329
I took some practical steps.

00:30:55.329 --> 00:30:57.329
I moved my locker.

00:30:57.329 --> 00:31:02.049
I made sure I had to retaliate.

00:31:02.049 --> 00:31:04.049
Walk away is something very powerful.

00:31:04.049 --> 00:31:06.049
It's something that's weak

00:31:06.049 --> 00:31:08.049
because you're giving into your emotions

00:31:08.049 --> 00:31:10.049
and you're just lashing out.

00:31:10.049 --> 00:31:12.049
Eventually the bully got suspended

00:31:12.049 --> 00:31:14.049
which gave me some peace.

00:31:14.049 --> 00:31:16.049
I ended up coming back

00:31:16.049 --> 00:31:18.049
after a week

00:31:18.049 --> 00:31:20.049
and he started up again with the attack.

00:31:20.049 --> 00:31:22.049
I noticed that he hadn't changed at all

00:31:22.049 --> 00:31:24.049
but I had.

00:31:24.049 --> 00:31:26.049
I was much more confident

00:31:26.049 --> 00:31:28.049
with that change.

00:31:28.049 --> 00:31:30.049
I began to fear him less.

00:31:30.049 --> 00:31:32.049
I wasn't scared of him.

00:31:32.049 --> 00:31:34.049
There were other young people

00:31:34.049 --> 00:31:36.049
as scriptures that you pick out

00:31:36.049 --> 00:31:38.049
everything really, really helps.

00:31:38.049 --> 00:31:40.049
And you can either see the situation

00:31:40.049 --> 00:31:42.049
die down or it's not as bad.

00:31:42.049 --> 00:31:44.049
You can deal with it

00:31:44.049 --> 00:31:46.049
or it just stops

00:31:46.049 --> 00:31:48.049
and it was so encouraging for me

00:31:48.049 --> 00:31:50.049
and it helped strengthen my faith

00:31:50.049 --> 00:31:52.049
in seeing how

00:31:52.049 --> 00:31:54.049
Jehovah really is there to help.

00:31:54.049 --> 00:31:56.049
Don't keep this to yourself.

00:31:56.049 --> 00:31:58.049
Don't bottle it up

00:31:58.049 --> 00:32:00.049
because that'll make things worse.

00:32:00.049 --> 00:32:02.049
Won't go away because you ignore it.

00:32:02.049 --> 00:32:04.049
You need to talk to someone.

00:32:04.049 --> 00:32:06.049
Talk to your parents.

00:32:06.049 --> 00:32:08.049
Talk to your friend. Talk to Jehovah.

00:32:08.049 --> 00:32:10.049
Talk to someone in the congregation.

00:32:10.049 --> 00:32:12.049
Because if you don't know what to do

00:32:12.049 --> 00:32:14.049
they'll help you find out what to do.

00:32:14.049 --> 00:32:16.049
And I'll give you guidance.

00:32:16.049 --> 00:32:18.049
And you'll be so impressed

00:32:18.049 --> 00:32:20.049
by how much Jehovah takes care of you

00:32:20.049 --> 00:32:42.500
and he'll show you that you are loved by him.

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.500
Our love by Jehovah.

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.500
So if you're suffering

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.500
at the hands of a bully

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:50.500
you are not alone.

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.500
Talk to your parents.

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.500
It won't go away if you ignore it.

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:58.500
But Jehovah can help you face up to bullies

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:02.500
and you can trust Bible principles

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:04.500
because they always work.

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:08.500
And they work across a wide range of challenges.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.500
In our next video

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:12.500
see how three brothers

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.500
learned that trust completely

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:16.500
in Jehovah and his righteous principles

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.500
when confronted

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.500
with persecution

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.500
in moral influences

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.500
and the snare

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.500
of pride.

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.500
Proverbs 35 and 6

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:30.500
made a tremendous impression on me.

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:32.500
Trust in Jehovah

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.500
with all your heart.

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.500
When I was younger I probably said,

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:40.500
all right, let me try it and see if it works.

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.500
As much as I loved

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.500
what I was learning from Jehovah

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:46.500
I was still leaning a lot

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:48.500
of my own understanding.

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.500
Obviously when we make decisions

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.500
in our lives, a spiritual person

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:54.500
they review and think,

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.500
let's do this Jehovah's way.

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.500
And that was something that I had lost

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:00.500
side of at that moment in my life.

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.500
There was considerable

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:08.460
opposition to the work.

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:10.460
We expected

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:12.460
when we did street work

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:14.460
we might be picked up

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:16.460
and taken a jail.

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:18.460
But Jehovah's organization

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:20.460
had explained to us

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:24.460
how we worked a hand-lit.

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:26.460
I do remember when the police

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.460
finally picked me up

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:30.460
and they drove me down to Chicago.

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:32.460
It was about an hour's drive

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:34.460
and they asked me,

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:36.460
so what did you do wrong?

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:38.460
So I had one hour to witness to them.

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:40.460
And as I recall

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:42.460
I kept track of it

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:44.460
and I counted the time too.

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:46.460
Things didn't disturb us

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:48.460
because we were being trained

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:50.460
by Jehovah's organization.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:52.460
We knew what to do.

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:54.460
So I ended up in a jail

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:56.460
in Chicago for a weekend

00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:00.460
and there was nothing I could do about it.

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:05.219
So I put up with it.

00:35:05.219 --> 00:35:07.219
So I was home for a day or two

00:35:07.219 --> 00:35:09.219
and then I went back to my assignment

00:35:09.219 --> 00:35:11.219
and I kept on working.

00:35:11.219 --> 00:35:13.219
Left the rest in Jehovah's hands

00:35:13.219 --> 00:35:15.219
and they handled it very nicely.

00:35:15.219 --> 00:35:17.219
Whether we were in jail

00:35:17.219 --> 00:35:19.219
or whether we were not.

00:35:19.219 --> 00:35:25.250
Eventually,

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:27.250
I stumbled upon the punk rock

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:29.250
anarchist scene.

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:31.250
And this really called out to me

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:33.250
because here I can be myself

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:35.250
I can establish my own standards.

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:37.250
But that scene eventually

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:39.250
led me down to a very dark path

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:41.250
of immorality, drug abuse,

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:43.250
drunkenness,

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:47.650
and a lot of violence.

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:49.650
I felt lonely, I felt betrayed,

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:51.650
I felt nothing made sense.

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:57.219
I remember thinking back on the wind

00:35:57.219 --> 00:35:59.219
I was learning about Jehovah

00:35:59.219 --> 00:36:01.219
and how simple things were.

00:36:01.219 --> 00:36:03.219
I decided to give Jehovah

00:36:03.219 --> 00:36:05.219
another shot.

00:36:05.219 --> 00:36:07.219
Reading Matthew 1624

00:36:07.219 --> 00:36:09.219
hit me really hard

00:36:09.219 --> 00:36:11.219
or where it says that

00:36:11.219 --> 00:36:13.219
to this own yourself

00:36:13.219 --> 00:36:15.219
because I knew that scripture

00:36:15.219 --> 00:36:17.219
but I still haven't really focused

00:36:17.219 --> 00:36:19.219
on what it meant for me.

00:36:19.219 --> 00:36:21.219
I knew I had to

00:36:21.219 --> 00:36:23.219
let go a certain

00:36:23.219 --> 00:36:25.219
parts of my personality

00:36:25.219 --> 00:36:27.219
of my old lifestyle.

00:36:27.219 --> 00:36:29.219
Never really given Jehovah

00:36:29.219 --> 00:36:31.219
a complete fair chance.

00:36:31.219 --> 00:36:33.219
And so I started applying more

00:36:33.219 --> 00:36:35.219
fully to principles I found

00:36:35.219 --> 00:36:37.219
so I trust in Jehovah more.

00:36:37.219 --> 00:36:39.219
Very quickly things started falling

00:36:39.219 --> 00:36:41.219
into place, the determination

00:36:41.219 --> 00:36:43.219
that I had to serve them,

00:36:43.219 --> 00:36:50.429
the changes that I needed to make,

00:36:50.429 --> 00:36:52.429
the changes that I never thought I could.

00:36:52.429 --> 00:36:54.429
Appointments and assignments.

00:36:54.429 --> 00:36:56.429
I think pride got the best

00:36:56.429 --> 00:36:58.429
to me there.

00:36:58.429 --> 00:37:02.320
Very shortly after we got

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.320
to the congregation in Brooklyn

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.320
I'm out in service with the

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.320
coordinator and he says to me

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.320
the letter came back

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.320
and you weren't recommended

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:16.019
as a servant.

00:37:16.019 --> 00:37:18.019
Do you know what happened?

00:37:18.019 --> 00:37:20.019
So I said, well you know

00:37:20.019 --> 00:37:22.019
I think those brothers have some

00:37:22.019 --> 00:37:25.260
problems over there.

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:27.260
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:29.260
Stop for a second here.

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:31.260
You don't need to tell me

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:33.260
anything negative about the

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:35.260
brothers and that all.

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:37.260
Focus on what you need to do

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:39.260
and Jehovah will take care

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:41.260
of the rest of it.

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:43.260
It really did feel like Jehovah

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.260
was just saying, okay stop.

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:47.260
Right now you need to focus on you

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:49.260
and that really just allowed me

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:51.260
to relax and focus on what was

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:53.260
really a lot more important

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:55.260
position in Jehovah's organization.

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:59.260
The humility and the patience

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:01.260
and the love and the adjustments

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:03.260
that I needed to make being a

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:05.260
more obedient servant of Jehovah

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:07.260
those were the things that were so

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:09.260
important that I had

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:11.260
had forgotten about for a while.

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:13.260
All the time that I spent

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:15.260
pursuing my own interests

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:17.260
it always led to disappointment

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:19.260
and now that I've learned

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.260
about Jehovah and

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:23.260
living by his principles

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:25.260
I have been having the time of my life.

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:27.260
To know that Jehovah

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:29.260
just simply wants to make me the best

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:31.260
version of me and teach me

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:33.260
to enhance my personality

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:35.260
and to become better

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:37.260
that really

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:39.260
endeared me to Jehovah.

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:41.260
Jehovah really cared

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:43.260
about me

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:45.260
enough to mold my thinking.

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:47.260
It was kind of like

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:49.260
my life was back in the focus

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.260
and I was able to just relax

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:53.260
and serve Jehovah

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.260
happily.

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:57.260
And then of course

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:59.260
the blessing started really pouring

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:01.260
in after that.

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:03.260
Everything I've done

00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:05.260
connection with the truth

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:09.820
I have enjoyed every speck of it.

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:11.820
You might have something great idea

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:13.820
but I found out

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:15.820
you do things Jehovah's way

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.820
and the end result is

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:19.820
nothing but good.

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:24.989
Isn't it wonderful

00:39:24.989 --> 00:39:26.989
that Jehovah cares so much

00:39:26.989 --> 00:39:28.989
that he takes the time

00:39:28.989 --> 00:39:30.989
to mold our thinking

00:39:30.989 --> 00:39:32.989
and help us be

00:39:32.989 --> 00:39:34.989
the best possible version

00:39:34.989 --> 00:39:36.989
of ourselves?

00:39:36.989 --> 00:39:38.989
And what a life lesson

00:39:38.989 --> 00:39:40.989
from Brother Adams.

00:39:40.989 --> 00:39:42.989
Do things

00:39:42.989 --> 00:39:44.989
Jehovah's way

00:39:44.989 --> 00:39:46.989
and the end result

00:39:46.989 --> 00:39:48.989
will be nothing but

00:39:48.989 --> 00:39:52.500
good.

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:53.500
With success like that.

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:55.500
Why would we try any other way?

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:57.500
Or as this month's

00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.500
music video asks

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:03.500
to whom could I go away?

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:05.500
Enjoy this faith

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:07.500
strengthening original song.

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:33.239
Listen to Jesus

00:40:33.239 --> 00:40:35.239
in these troublesome days

00:40:35.239 --> 00:40:39.239
He lights up my path

00:40:39.239 --> 00:40:41.239
as I hear and obey

00:40:41.239 --> 00:40:43.239
He is the

00:40:43.239 --> 00:40:45.239
fine shepherd

00:40:45.239 --> 00:40:47.239
and He shows me

00:40:47.239 --> 00:40:49.239
the way.

00:40:49.239 --> 00:40:51.239
He guides every step

00:40:51.239 --> 00:40:53.239
never leads me astray.

00:40:53.239 --> 00:41:01.659
Should I ever listen

00:41:01.659 --> 00:41:05.659
to voices in all

00:41:05.659 --> 00:41:07.659
position?

00:41:07.659 --> 00:42:13.670
Oh, so am I

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:15.670
placing his care

00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:27.110
so right that Jehovah

00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:29.110
is my Savior

00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:31.110
with things of life.

00:42:31.110 --> 00:44:35.219
Certainly,

00:44:35.219 --> 00:44:37.219
that's how we all feel.

00:44:37.219 --> 00:44:39.219
Never do we want

00:44:39.219 --> 00:44:41.219
to stray from the great shepherd

00:44:41.219 --> 00:44:43.219
Jesus Christ

00:44:43.219 --> 00:44:45.219
as He leads us through the end of this

00:44:45.219 --> 00:44:47.219
trouble system of things.

00:44:47.219 --> 00:44:49.219
May this song

00:44:49.219 --> 00:44:51.219
encourage us to stick

00:44:51.219 --> 00:44:53.219
close to Jehovah's

00:44:53.219 --> 00:44:55.219
organization?

00:44:55.219 --> 00:44:57.219
No matter what

00:44:57.219 --> 00:44:59.219
for imperfect humans

00:44:59.219 --> 00:45:03.219
unity rarely comes easily.

00:45:03.219 --> 00:45:05.219
In our following video

00:45:05.219 --> 00:45:07.219
please note how the governing body

00:45:07.219 --> 00:45:09.219
has always worked

00:45:09.219 --> 00:45:11.219
to maintain unity

00:45:11.219 --> 00:45:13.219
in behalf of the world

00:45:13.219 --> 00:45:26.170
wide brotherhood.

00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:30.250
I'm getting along all right.

00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:32.250
There's a little tumor

00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:35.590
here in the brain

00:45:35.590 --> 00:45:39.320
which the doctors are treating

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:41.320
and whatever comes

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:43.320
together

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:47.019
but it has been

00:45:47.019 --> 00:45:49.019
wonderful to work

00:45:49.019 --> 00:45:51.019
with you all these years

00:45:51.019 --> 00:45:55.019
and I enjoy the tremendously

00:45:55.019 --> 00:45:57.019
and I'm very grateful

00:45:57.019 --> 00:45:59.019
to Jehovah I could come

00:45:59.019 --> 00:46:01.019
to this meeting

00:46:01.019 --> 00:46:16.739
and move ahead.

00:46:16.739 --> 00:46:18.739
Like CT Russell before him,

00:46:18.739 --> 00:46:20.739
Brother Nor had an

00:46:20.739 --> 00:46:22.739
exceptional gift for organizing

00:46:22.739 --> 00:46:24.739
the kingdom work.

00:46:24.739 --> 00:46:25.739
That's at the stage for the amazing growth,

00:46:25.739 --> 00:46:27.739
that the organization experienced

00:46:27.739 --> 00:46:29.739
during the closing decades

00:46:29.739 --> 00:46:31.739
of the 20th century.

00:46:31.739 --> 00:46:33.739
Nathan Nor died on June

00:46:33.739 --> 00:46:35.739
8, 1977.

00:46:35.739 --> 00:46:37.739
Note what brother Albert Schroeder

00:46:37.739 --> 00:46:39.739
a fellow member of the governing body

00:46:39.739 --> 00:46:41.739
wrote about him.

00:46:41.739 --> 00:46:43.739
As the society's principal

00:46:43.739 --> 00:46:45.739
administrator, there have come to be

00:46:45.739 --> 00:46:47.739
over 90 branches.

00:46:47.739 --> 00:46:49.739
Brother Nor has proved to be the right

00:46:49.739 --> 00:46:51.739
theocratic entrepreneur

00:46:51.739 --> 00:46:53.739
for this period of Jehovah's

00:46:54.739 --> 00:46:57.739
Brother Nor helped to clarify

00:46:57.739 --> 00:46:59.739
the role of the governing body

00:46:59.739 --> 00:47:01.739
and its committees.

00:47:01.739 --> 00:47:03.739
Headquarters representatives were sent

00:47:03.739 --> 00:47:05.739
out to various branches.

00:47:05.739 --> 00:47:07.739
Branches were better organized.

00:47:07.739 --> 00:47:09.739
Bodies of elders were

00:47:09.739 --> 00:47:11.739
appointed in various congregations.

00:47:11.739 --> 00:47:15.739
Training programs were instituted.

00:47:15.739 --> 00:47:17.739
Schools were established.

00:47:17.739 --> 00:47:19.739
Due to the organizational growth

00:47:19.739 --> 00:47:21.739
the number of conventions

00:47:21.739 --> 00:47:23.739
that the governing body

00:47:23.739 --> 00:47:25.739
had been held worldwide

00:47:25.739 --> 00:47:27.739
now numbered into the hundreds.

00:47:27.739 --> 00:47:29.739
And the governing body members

00:47:29.739 --> 00:47:31.739
wanted to be present

00:47:31.739 --> 00:47:33.739
at as many of those conventions as possible.

00:47:33.739 --> 00:47:35.739
For example, at the 1969

00:47:35.739 --> 00:47:37.739
Peace on Earth International Convention

00:47:37.739 --> 00:47:39.739
a governing body member

00:47:39.739 --> 00:47:41.739
would fly to the convention city

00:47:41.739 --> 00:47:43.739
for the opening day,

00:47:43.739 --> 00:47:45.739
catch a flight to another convention city

00:47:45.739 --> 00:47:47.739
and then return to the original city

00:47:47.739 --> 00:47:49.739
so that he could speak

00:47:49.739 --> 00:47:51.739
to the convention.

00:47:51.739 --> 00:47:53.739
80s, many existing branches

00:47:53.739 --> 00:47:55.739
with printing and shipping capabilities

00:47:55.739 --> 00:47:57.739
needed to expand.

00:47:57.739 --> 00:47:59.739
To ensure that the worldwide supply

00:47:59.739 --> 00:48:01.739
of spiritual food

00:48:01.739 --> 00:48:03.739
would flow uninterrupted.

00:48:03.739 --> 00:48:05.739
No matter what may happen

00:48:05.739 --> 00:48:07.739
on the world's scene.

00:48:07.739 --> 00:48:09.739
At times there were more than

00:48:09.739 --> 00:48:11.739
20 branch construction

00:48:11.739 --> 00:48:13.739
or expansion projects

00:48:13.739 --> 00:48:15.739
going on simultaneously.

00:48:15.739 --> 00:48:17.739
And the governing body was very

00:48:17.739 --> 00:48:19.739
convenient.

00:48:19.739 --> 00:48:21.739
It was always very encouraging

00:48:21.739 --> 00:48:23.739
to have contact

00:48:23.739 --> 00:48:25.739
to the brothers of the governing body

00:48:25.739 --> 00:48:27.739
to see their great zeal

00:48:27.739 --> 00:48:29.739
and their loving interest

00:48:29.739 --> 00:48:33.739
in the brothers behind the iron curtain.

00:48:33.739 --> 00:48:35.739
1977,

00:48:35.739 --> 00:48:39.739
something outstanding happened.

00:48:39.739 --> 00:48:41.739
In 1977

00:48:41.739 --> 00:48:43.739
it was possible

00:48:43.739 --> 00:48:45.739
for brothers Gerrus,

00:48:45.739 --> 00:48:47.739
friends, and sit leak

00:48:47.739 --> 00:48:49.739
to visit the brothers in Poland.

00:48:49.739 --> 00:48:51.739
So it was the first time.

00:48:51.739 --> 00:48:53.739
The first time

00:48:53.739 --> 00:48:57.739
that members of the governing body

00:48:57.739 --> 00:48:59.739
could visit the country

00:48:59.739 --> 00:49:01.739
behind the iron curtain.

00:49:01.739 --> 00:49:03.739
They spoke to many overseers,

00:49:03.739 --> 00:49:05.739
pioneers,

00:49:05.739 --> 00:49:07.739
and long-time witnessing

00:49:07.739 --> 00:49:09.739
that was, of course, a wonderful experience.

00:49:09.739 --> 00:49:11.739
One year after this visit,

00:49:11.739 --> 00:49:13.739
brother Gerrus, along with

00:49:13.739 --> 00:49:15.739
brother Henshel,

00:49:15.739 --> 00:49:17.739
were able to get an appointment

00:49:17.739 --> 00:49:19.739
with government officials

00:49:19.739 --> 00:49:21.739
to promote a more tolerant attitude

00:49:21.739 --> 00:49:23.739
of Jehovah's organization

00:49:23.739 --> 00:49:25.739
and the work that Jehovah's Witnesses

00:49:25.739 --> 00:49:27.739
were doing in Eastern Europe

00:49:27.739 --> 00:49:29.739
and especially in Poland.

00:49:29.739 --> 00:49:31.739
Now mind you, this was all taking place

00:49:31.739 --> 00:49:33.739
some 10 years prior

00:49:33.739 --> 00:49:35.739
to the fall of communism

00:49:35.739 --> 00:49:37.739
in Eastern Europe.

00:49:37.739 --> 00:49:39.739
They took various steps

00:49:39.739 --> 00:49:41.739
in the process.

00:49:41.739 --> 00:49:43.739
And brother Barry

00:49:43.739 --> 00:49:45.739
of the governing body

00:49:45.739 --> 00:49:47.739
had the opportunity

00:49:47.739 --> 00:49:49.739
to hold a secret meeting

00:49:49.739 --> 00:49:51.739
in the city of Leningrad

00:49:51.739 --> 00:49:53.739
with brother Kosa,

00:49:53.739 --> 00:49:55.739
who was responsible

00:49:55.739 --> 00:49:57.739
for the activity in the territory.

00:49:57.739 --> 00:49:59.739
Brother Kosa said that

00:49:59.739 --> 00:50:01.739
he received tremendous encouragement

00:50:01.739 --> 00:50:03.739
from that discussion

00:50:03.739 --> 00:50:05.739
from the conversation with brother Barry.

00:50:05.739 --> 00:50:07.739
And it was interesting

00:50:07.739 --> 00:50:09.739
that it wasn't until after that meeting,

00:50:09.739 --> 00:50:11.739
it helped to resist

00:50:11.739 --> 00:50:13.739
decades of satanic efforts

00:50:13.739 --> 00:50:15.739
to destroy their fate in Jehovah

00:50:15.739 --> 00:50:17.739
and weaken the unity

00:50:17.739 --> 00:50:19.739
and confidence in his organization.

00:50:19.739 --> 00:50:21.739
And the members of the governing body

00:50:21.739 --> 00:50:23.739
showed a very deep

00:50:23.739 --> 00:50:25.739
appreciation for the brothers

00:50:25.739 --> 00:50:27.739
who kept the communication

00:50:27.739 --> 00:50:29.739
to the brothers

00:50:29.739 --> 00:50:31.739
behind the iron curtain

00:50:31.739 --> 00:50:33.739
because you have to imagine

00:50:33.739 --> 00:50:35.739
how to get the spiritual food

00:50:35.739 --> 00:50:37.739
they had to be willing

00:50:37.739 --> 00:50:39.739
on a personal risk

00:50:39.739 --> 00:50:41.739
to visit

00:50:41.739 --> 00:50:43.739
and to bring the spirit of food

00:50:43.739 --> 00:50:45.739
to the brothers there,

00:50:45.739 --> 00:50:47.739
not just to the countries

00:50:47.739 --> 00:50:49.739
right close

00:50:49.739 --> 00:50:51.739
but down there

00:50:51.739 --> 00:50:53.739
to the brothers

00:50:53.739 --> 00:50:55.739
down there to Siberia.

00:50:55.739 --> 00:50:57.739
In the second half

00:50:57.739 --> 00:50:59.739
of the 1980s,

00:50:59.739 --> 00:51:01.739
the iron curtain began to open up.

00:51:01.739 --> 00:51:04.989
There was a sense of freedom

00:51:04.989 --> 00:51:06.989
in the air.

00:51:06.989 --> 00:51:08.989
The brothers in eastern Europe could

00:51:08.989 --> 00:51:10.989
feel that freedom.

00:51:10.989 --> 00:51:12.989
As government's

00:51:12.989 --> 00:51:14.989
glanted permission, the governing body

00:51:14.989 --> 00:51:16.989
organized conventions

00:51:16.989 --> 00:51:18.989
in eastern-blocked countries

00:51:18.989 --> 00:51:20.989
for example in Poland

00:51:20.989 --> 00:51:22.989
and Czechoslovakia.

00:51:22.989 --> 00:51:24.989
And when bands were lifted

00:51:24.989 --> 00:51:26.989
the members of the governing body

00:51:26.989 --> 00:51:28.989
travelled for many times

00:51:28.989 --> 00:51:30.989
then in all the countries

00:51:30.989 --> 00:51:32.989
it was possible

00:51:32.989 --> 00:51:34.989
Poland, Hungary, Romania

00:51:34.989 --> 00:51:36.989
Czechoslovakia, Russia, Ukraine,

00:51:36.989 --> 00:51:38.989
and to the Baltic states

00:51:38.989 --> 00:51:40.989
and also to Belarus.

00:51:40.989 --> 00:51:42.989
In November 1989,

00:51:42.989 --> 00:51:44.989
the Berlin Wall

00:51:44.989 --> 00:51:46.989
came down.

00:51:46.989 --> 00:51:48.989
This was a great turning point

00:51:48.989 --> 00:51:50.989
in the history of the 20th century

00:51:50.989 --> 00:51:52.989
but it also meant

00:51:52.989 --> 00:51:54.989
greater freedom for our brothers.

00:51:54.989 --> 00:51:56.989
The governing body

00:51:56.989 --> 00:51:58.989
sprung into action.

00:51:58.989 --> 00:52:00.989
They wanted to go

00:52:00.989 --> 00:52:02.989
and accelerate the work there.

00:52:02.989 --> 00:52:04.989
So brother-gerus

00:52:04.989 --> 00:52:06.989
they just skyrocketed.

00:52:06.989 --> 00:52:08.989
In the fall of 1989

00:52:08.989 --> 00:52:10.989
brothers Milton Henshel

00:52:10.989 --> 00:52:12.989
and Theodor Gerus had the

00:52:12.989 --> 00:52:14.989
unique opportunity of visiting

00:52:14.989 --> 00:52:16.989
the brothers in the Soviet Union

00:52:16.989 --> 00:52:18.989
for the first time.

00:52:18.989 --> 00:52:20.989
The brothers really wanted to study

00:52:20.989 --> 00:52:22.989
the situation on the ground.

00:52:22.989 --> 00:52:24.989
They met with all of the

00:52:24.989 --> 00:52:26.989
elders,

00:52:26.989 --> 00:52:28.989
circuit overseers,

00:52:28.989 --> 00:52:30.989
district overseers,

00:52:30.989 --> 00:52:32.989
and members of the country committee.

00:52:32.989 --> 00:52:34.989
So it is on Europe.

00:52:34.989 --> 00:52:36.989
1991 was the

00:52:36.989 --> 00:52:38.989
stage for three

00:52:38.989 --> 00:52:40.989
international conventions

00:52:40.989 --> 00:52:42.989
with the subject

00:52:42.989 --> 00:52:44.989
lovers of godly freedom.

00:52:44.989 --> 00:52:46.989
But of course,

00:52:46.989 --> 00:52:48.989
besides these international conventions

00:52:48.989 --> 00:52:50.989
other open conventions.

00:52:50.989 --> 00:52:52.989
So not in secret.

00:52:52.989 --> 00:52:54.989
No.

00:52:54.989 --> 00:52:56.989
Open conventions were held

00:52:56.989 --> 00:52:58.989
in the first time

00:52:58.989 --> 00:53:00.989
in the former Soviet Union

00:53:00.989 --> 00:53:02.989
in Estonia

00:53:02.989 --> 00:53:04.989
in Russia

00:53:04.989 --> 00:53:06.989
and Ukraine.

00:53:06.989 --> 00:53:08.989
Just imagine,

00:53:08.989 --> 00:53:10.989
after decades of such difficult

00:53:10.989 --> 00:53:12.989
persecution, we experience

00:53:12.989 --> 00:53:14.989
the opportunity to be together

00:53:14.989 --> 00:53:16.989
with our worldwide brotherhood

00:53:16.989 --> 00:53:18.989
and to see the brothers from the

00:53:18.989 --> 00:53:20.989
governing body.

00:53:20.989 --> 00:53:22.989
It was an unforgettable time.

00:53:22.989 --> 00:53:24.989
It was the happiest of times.

00:53:24.989 --> 00:53:26.989
It was super.

00:53:26.989 --> 00:53:28.989
One outstanding convention

00:53:28.989 --> 00:53:30.989
was held in Zagreb.

00:53:30.989 --> 00:53:32.989
Yes.

00:53:32.989 --> 00:53:34.989
It was a loving

00:53:34.989 --> 00:53:36.989
and courageous decision

00:53:36.989 --> 00:53:38.989
of the governing body

00:53:38.989 --> 00:53:40.989
to go there

00:53:40.989 --> 00:53:42.989
despite the uncertainty

00:53:42.989 --> 00:53:44.989
of the political situation

00:53:44.989 --> 00:53:46.989
in the country

00:53:46.989 --> 00:53:48.989
and maybe coming up

00:53:48.989 --> 00:53:50.989
a civil war.

00:53:50.989 --> 00:53:52.989
This convention

00:53:52.989 --> 00:53:54.989
was the only public event

00:53:54.989 --> 00:53:56.989
that was allowed

00:53:56.989 --> 00:53:58.989
by the government in the city

00:53:58.989 --> 00:54:00.989
of Zagreb.

00:54:00.989 --> 00:54:02.989
All other public events

00:54:02.989 --> 00:54:04.989
were canceled.

00:54:04.989 --> 00:54:06.989
But the convention of

00:54:06.989 --> 00:54:08.989
Jehovah's Witnesses

00:54:08.989 --> 00:54:10.989
was not.

00:54:10.989 --> 00:54:12.989
Police men and soldiers

00:54:12.989 --> 00:54:14.989
signed to keep security

00:54:14.989 --> 00:54:16.989
in order in the stadium.

00:54:16.989 --> 00:54:18.989
They were astonished that

00:54:18.989 --> 00:54:20.989
servants,

00:54:20.989 --> 00:54:22.989
cohorts,

00:54:22.989 --> 00:54:24.989
souvenirs,

00:54:24.989 --> 00:54:26.989
and even more.

00:54:26.989 --> 00:54:28.989
At those international conventions

00:54:28.989 --> 00:54:30.989
in Eastern Europe,

00:54:30.989 --> 00:54:32.989
members of the governing body

00:54:32.989 --> 00:54:34.989
gave the final motivating talk.

00:54:34.989 --> 00:54:36.989
And those talks

00:54:36.989 --> 00:54:38.989
given less than five months

00:54:38.989 --> 00:54:40.989
after the thrill of obtaining

00:54:40.989 --> 00:54:42.989
legal recognition

00:54:42.989 --> 00:54:44.989
for our work in the Soviet Union

00:54:44.989 --> 00:54:46.989
strengthened and encouraged our brothers

00:54:46.989 --> 00:54:48.989
for trials they would face

00:54:48.989 --> 00:54:50.989
in the future.

00:54:50.989 --> 00:54:52.989
It's plain to see

00:54:52.989 --> 00:54:54.989
the no-well the appearance

00:54:54.989 --> 00:54:56.989
of the flock.

00:54:56.989 --> 00:54:58.989
They poured themselves

00:54:58.989 --> 00:55:00.989
out like a drink offering

00:55:00.989 --> 00:55:02.989
in order to take good care

00:55:02.989 --> 00:55:04.989
of the sheep.

00:55:04.989 --> 00:55:06.989
The same deep love

00:55:06.989 --> 00:55:08.989
and tender concern for you.

00:55:08.989 --> 00:55:10.989
The sheep of the great shepherd's flock

00:55:10.989 --> 00:55:12.989
has been evident

00:55:12.989 --> 00:55:16.429
throughout modern times

00:55:16.429 --> 00:55:18.429
right down to this day.

00:55:18.429 --> 00:55:20.429
What striking evidence

00:55:20.429 --> 00:55:22.429
of unity

00:55:22.429 --> 00:55:24.429
among them roiled

00:55:24.429 --> 00:55:26.429
with ethnic strife,

00:55:26.429 --> 00:55:28.429
hatred, and violence?

00:55:28.429 --> 00:55:30.429
Our brothers

00:55:30.429 --> 00:55:32.429
enjoyed a peaceful convention

00:55:32.429 --> 00:55:34.429
that rightly impressed

00:55:34.429 --> 00:55:36.429
the authorities.

00:55:36.429 --> 00:55:38.429
Our faith in the fine shepherd

00:55:38.429 --> 00:55:40.429
and his father

00:55:40.429 --> 00:55:42.429
surely is being rewarded now

00:55:42.429 --> 00:55:44.429
and will be even more

00:55:44.429 --> 00:55:46.429
abundantly rewarded

00:55:46.429 --> 00:55:48.429
in the future.

00:55:48.429 --> 00:55:50.429
Perhaps like many,

00:55:50.429 --> 00:55:54.429
they were really

00:55:54.429 --> 00:55:56.429
very humble.

00:55:56.429 --> 00:55:58.429
Daniel, a lifetime of faith,

00:55:58.429 --> 00:56:00.429
what moving lessons

00:56:00.429 --> 00:56:02.429
and awesome depictions

00:56:02.429 --> 00:56:04.429
of visions and events

00:56:04.429 --> 00:56:06.429
from his life?

00:56:06.429 --> 00:56:08.429
Would you like to take a look

00:56:08.429 --> 00:56:10.429
behind the scenes

00:56:10.429 --> 00:56:12.429
and see what went into making it?

00:56:12.429 --> 00:56:26.719
Less enjoy a tour

00:56:26.719 --> 00:56:28.719
of some of the work

00:56:28.719 --> 00:56:30.719
that helped bring this

00:56:30.719 --> 00:56:41.650
Visions, amazing scenery and architecture, all of it serves to teach readers about the

00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:47.210
times we live in now and how we can faithfully serve Jehovah.

00:56:47.210 --> 00:56:54.769
The team that made Daniel a lifetime of faith had to portray these amazing things on film.

00:56:54.769 --> 00:56:59.010
How did they do it?

00:56:59.010 --> 00:57:04.489
Early concept art was made to help in the development of the many visual effects scenes.

00:57:16.469 --> 00:57:21.710
The architecture and aesthetics of Babylon were quite different from what the Israelites

00:57:21.710 --> 00:57:24.110
were used to.

00:57:24.110 --> 00:57:34.130
The sets needed to be designed in a way that helped convey what it was like being captured

00:57:34.130 --> 00:57:39.369
and brought to a foreign land.

00:57:39.369 --> 00:57:47.329
The production design and sets and props departments built 360 degree sets which made

00:57:47.329 --> 00:57:54.539
for an immersive environment.

00:57:54.539 --> 00:58:01.050
All the other ones are an able to make these predictions.

00:58:01.050 --> 00:58:08.170
You're able to do so.

00:58:13.019 --> 00:58:22.400
Many costumes and props were carefully handmade for the production.

00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:28.619
Spearheads were hand forged.

00:58:28.619 --> 00:58:39.590
Most of the filming was done at Mount Ebo Studios in Brewster, New York.

00:58:39.590 --> 00:58:45.849
Some additional scenes were filmed in nearby locations

00:58:45.849 --> 00:58:49.570
and in Florida.

00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:55.670
You need to rest.

00:58:55.670 --> 00:59:04.980
Several miniature sets were built, including a cigarette, and then actors were filmed

00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:12.980
in front of a green screen and inserted into the final shots.

00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:19.260
As filming was completed, scenes were edited together, and the visual effects team went

00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:28.719
to work on many specialized shots.

00:59:28.719 --> 00:59:35.239
Digital models of people and animals were animated and combined with footage of real environments

00:59:35.239 --> 00:59:40.079
to make scenes that would have been impossible to film otherwise.

00:59:40.079 --> 00:59:47.119
For example, a digital model was made of the immense image in King Nebuchadnezzar's dream.

00:59:47.119 --> 00:59:53.079
The team researched the characteristics of the actual materials described in the scriptures,

00:59:53.079 --> 00:59:56.679
such as metals and rocks.

00:59:56.679 --> 01:00:16.409
So that when the image falls, it appears realistic and believable.

01:00:16.409 --> 01:00:25.690
Just look at the results of thousands of hours spent modeling, animating, simulating,

01:00:25.690 --> 01:01:02.159
rendering, and compositing music and sound effects at the final touches.

01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:08.579
What do you see, Jehovah asked the prophet Amos?

01:01:08.579 --> 01:01:20.179
When Amos saw taught him important lessons in the drama, Daniel, a lifetime of faith,

01:01:20.179 --> 01:01:33.380
what did you see, and more importantly, what did you learn?

01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:42.179
What did you see, hours of hard work, dramatic visual effects, Bible characters brought to

01:01:42.179 --> 01:01:45.019
life on screen?

01:01:45.019 --> 01:01:51.219
Isn't it amazing how they all combine to make what happened thousands of years ago seem

01:01:51.219 --> 01:01:55.699
so real, so vivid, and faith strengthening?

01:01:55.699 --> 01:02:00.619
Now, let's enjoy this month's postcard.

01:02:00.619 --> 01:02:06.579
As together, we climb the peaks of Switzerland.

01:02:06.579 --> 01:02:11.579
About 70% of Switzerland is covered by mountains.

01:02:11.579 --> 01:02:22.420
This tallest mountain rises to 4,634 meters, or over 15,000 feet above sea level.

01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:31.900
Switzerland has four official languages, German, French, Italian, and Romance, a descendant

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:36.260
language of the Latin spoken in the Roman Empire.

01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:46.699
Switzerland has beautiful waterfalls, glaciers, lakes, rivers, streams, and alpine meadows.

01:02:46.699 --> 01:02:55.739
cows graze these meadows, and from their milk, the Swiss make about 450 varieties of delicious

01:02:55.739 --> 01:02:58.019
cheese.

01:02:58.019 --> 01:03:03.099
Switzerland is also well known for another treat, chocolate.

01:03:03.099 --> 01:03:08.380
In fact, the Swiss consume more chocolate per person than people in any other country

01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:10.659
in the world.

01:03:10.659 --> 01:03:17.500
Since Switzerland didn't participate in World War I, it provided an ideal location to

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:23.619
establish the first central European branch office of Jehovah's Witnesses in the early

01:03:23.619 --> 01:03:26.059
1920s.

01:03:26.059 --> 01:03:31.860
During World War II, Jehovah's Witnesses from Switzerland helped to provide waters of

01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:37.260
truth to other countries in Europe at great effort and cost.

01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:44.340
Our brothers found ways to get spiritual food to their brothers in Nazi Germany.

01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:51.539
After World War II, our Swiss brothers generously donated food, clothing, and money to support

01:03:51.539 --> 01:03:59.059
the brotherhood as part of the first large-scale relief effort of our modern-day organization.

01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:08.179
Today, over 19,000 witnesses across the country meet and 264 congregations, as well as 39

01:04:08.179 --> 01:04:12.619
groups or pre-groups in 26 languages.

01:04:12.619 --> 01:04:20.099
Even though a small percentage of the population speaks Rommage, our fellow witnesses make a concerted

01:04:20.099 --> 01:04:25.059
effort to reach them in the language of their heart.

01:04:25.059 --> 01:04:33.300
The 53 publishers in the Bayver congregation are busy spreading Kingdom Truth.

01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:38.739
The Kingdom Hall in Bayver is located in the middle of the Alps at a height of some 1700

01:04:38.739 --> 01:04:47.380
meters or 5500 feet, making it one of the highest Kingdom halls in all of Europe.

01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:53.179
The congregation has 10 regular pioneers and also hosts an Italian group supported by

01:04:53.179 --> 01:04:55.739
15 publishers.

01:04:55.739 --> 01:05:04.739
The Bayver congregation sends its warm love to our worldwide family.

01:05:04.739 --> 01:05:11.539
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
