00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:05.589
This month, I'd like to discuss how our understanding of this

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:10.589
generation that Jesus spoke about at Matthew 2434 has a

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:13.390
bearing on the nearness of the time of the end of this

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.390
system of things. Now, you'll remember what Jesus said, as

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.390
recorded at Matthew 2434, he said, this generation will by

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:30.489
no means pass away until all these things happen. Now, you'll

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.490
notice that there are two elements in this verse. We talk

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.990
about this generation, so we need to know what that's about,

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.990
and also what are all these things that are going to happen.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.490
Well, let's take the second point first. What are all these

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.990
things that Jesus was referring to? Well, if you look in the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.490
context of Matthew 24, you see that Jesus talks about

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.490
nation rising against nation, kingdom against kingdom,

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.490
food shortages, earthquakes, and one place after another.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.989
Fine. So the generation that Jesus is talking about will not

00:01:06.989 --> 00:01:12.489
pass away until it sees war, famine, earthquakes, but is

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:17.489
there more? There's more. In the same chapter, Jesus talks

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:22.489
about a great tribulation. So the generation will not pass

00:01:22.489 --> 00:01:28.489
away until the great tribulation occurs. Now, that is

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:33.489
interesting. That is relevant to us. But, of course, we have to

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:38.489
know what is a generation, and which particular generation was

00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:43.489
Jesus talking about? Now, if you were asked by someone to

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:47.489
identify a scripture that tells us what a generation is, what

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:52.489
scripture would you turn to? I'll give you a moment. Think

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:57.489
about that. My choice is Exodus chapter 1 and verse 6. Let's

00:01:57.489 --> 00:02:04.489
read that. Exodus chapter 1 and verse 6. It says, Joseph

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:11.490
eventually died, and also all his brothers, and all that

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.490
generation. Now, what do we know about Joseph's family? We

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.490
know that Joseph had eleven brothers. Ten of them were older

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.490
than Joseph. One of them, Benjamin, was younger. And we know

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.490
that at least two of Joseph's brothers actually lived longer

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.490
than Joseph, because the Bible says that on his deathbed he

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:39.490
called his brothers plural to him. But now, what did Joseph and

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.490
his brothers all have in common? They were all contemporaries.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.490
They had all lived at the same time. They were part of the same

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.490
generation. Now, suppose there was a man who died ten

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.490
minutes before Joseph was born. Would he be part of Joseph's

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.490
generation? No. Because he'd never lived at the same time as

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.490
Joseph. He was not a contemporary of Joseph's.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.490
Now, suppose there was a little baby who was born ten minutes

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.490
after Joseph died. Would the baby be part of Joseph's

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.490
generation? Again, no. Because the baby would not have lived

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.490
at the same time as Joseph. For the man and the baby to be

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.490
part of Joseph's generation, they would have had to have lived

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.490
at least some time during Joseph's lifespan. So now we've

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.490
discovered what it means to have a generation, what makes

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.490
up a generation. It's a group of contemporaries. It's a group

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.490
of people who have lived at the same time. But now Jesus said,

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.490
this generation will not pass, will by no means pass away until

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.490
all these things happen. So what particular generation was

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.490
Jesus referring to? For that we have to go to the context of

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.490
Jesus' words. So let's turn to Matthew chapter 24 and we're

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.490
going to read verses 32 to 34. This is very important and

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:18.490
it's very enlightening. Matthew chapter 24 verses 32 to 34.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:26.490
Jesus says, now learn this illustration from the fig tree.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.490
Just as soon as its young branch grows tender and sprouts

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:37.490
its leaves, you know that summer is near. Likewise, also

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.490
you, when you see all these things, know that he is near

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.490
at the doors. Truly, I say to you that this generation will

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:53.490
by no means pass away until all these things happen.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.490
Now let's go back to verse 32. Notice that Jesus is saying

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.490
that his disciples should learn something from the fig tree.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.490
Now any little boy, any small child can see a leaf on a tree

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:14.490
and point to it and say, look, leaf, but what does it mean?

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.490
The child may not know that summer is near, but an older

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.490
person who sees the leaves on the trees is going to say,

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.490
ah, I know that something that can't be seen yet is going to happen.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.490
Summer is going to come. Now you can't see it yet, but the older

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.490
person knows that summer is near. And then in verse 33, Jesus

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.490
starts out by saying likewise. So he's making a connection,

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.490
isn't it, between verse 33 and verse 32. He says likewise

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:52.490
also you, when you see all these things, know that he is near

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.490
at the doors. Now what does Jesus mean by all these things?

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.490
Well, the things he talked about earlier in the chapter.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.490
Nation rising against nation, kingdom against kingdom, food

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.490
shortages, earthquakes, pestilences and so on. He says when you see

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.490
all these things, I want you to draw a conclusion, a conclusion

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:19.490
about something spiritual. Now when did all these things begin

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:27.490
to appear in 1914? Now in 1914 any young boy could see the

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:32.490
various aspects of the sign, wars, famines, earthquakes and so on,

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:37.490
and conclude that they were bad. But what did it all mean?

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.490
Only those with spiritual discernment would draw the conclusion,

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:47.490
as Jesus said, that he is near at the doors. Now here's the

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:53.490
point. In 1914, who were the only ones who saw these various

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:58.490
aspects of the sign and drew the right conclusion that something

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:05.490
invisible was occurring, only the anointed. So this generation

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:10.490
is made up of anointed ones who see the sign and have the

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:15.490
spiritual discernment to draw the proper conclusion about the sign.

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.490
Now one of those who saw the sign and understood what it meant was

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:26.490
Brother Frederick Franz. Brother Franz was born in 1893 and he was

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:31.490
baptized in November of 1913. So as one of the lords anointed in

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:38.490
1914, he saw the sign and he was able to understand its meaning.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:43.490
There were other anointed ones who also saw the sign and understood

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:52.769
its meaning. Joseph Rutherford, A. H. McMillan, W. E. Van Ambre,

00:07:52.769 --> 00:08:00.279
after 1914 others were anointed with Holy Spirit. These

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:07.279
include such well-known brothers as Nathan Norr, Lyman Swingle,

00:08:07.279 --> 00:08:16.279
Grant Souter, Milton Henshel, and George Ganges. They were anointed

00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:19.279
contemporaries of some in the first group. So really these

00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:25.279
brothers make up part of the second group of the generation. That

00:08:26.279 --> 00:08:30.279
is significant and we'll come back to it in a moment.

00:08:30.279 --> 00:08:34.279
Would you like an easy way to keep the generation straight? An easy

00:08:34.279 --> 00:08:39.279
way is to consider the situation of Brother Fred W. Franz. Now you'll

00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:44.279
see that he is F. W. F. on the chart. Now as we said before,

00:08:44.279 --> 00:08:51.279
Brother Franz was born in 1893. He was baptized in November of 1913.

00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:55.279
So as one of the Lords anointed in 1914 he saw the sign and he

00:08:55.279 --> 00:09:00.279
understood what the sign meant. Now Brother Franz lived a long

00:09:00.279 --> 00:09:06.279
life. He finished his earthly course at 99 years of age in 1992.

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:13.279
Now do you know of many who were of the anointed in 1914 and who

00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:19.279
outlived Brother Franz? There may have been some, but not many.

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:23.279
Now just for the sake of argument, suppose that we assume that

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:27.279
Brother Franz was the last of that first group of anointed ones.

00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:31.279
That is the group of anointed ones who were anointed in 1914,

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:35.279
who saw the sign and then continued serving faithfully. Now we're

00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:39.279
not saying Brother Franz was. We just don't know. But for the sake of

00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:44.279
argument, let's suppose in order to be part of this generation,

00:09:44.279 --> 00:09:49.279
someone would have had to have been anointed before 1992,

00:09:49.279 --> 00:09:53.279
because he would have to have been a contemporary of some of the

00:09:53.279 --> 00:09:59.279
first group. Now again, we're not saying that Brother Franz was

00:09:59.279 --> 00:10:03.279
the last of this group, but we're just using this for the sake of

00:10:03.279 --> 00:10:08.279
argument as a point of reference. Anyone anointed after 1992 would be

00:10:08.279 --> 00:10:12.279
of the anointed, but he would not be part of this generation.

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:17.279
And Jesus said, this generation will not pass away until all

00:10:17.279 --> 00:10:22.279
these things happen. Are you beginning to see how this all

00:10:22.279 --> 00:10:26.279
connects with the urgency of our times? Someone might say,

00:10:26.279 --> 00:10:29.279
we know that some of the anointed will be on the earth when the

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:32.279
great tribulation breaks out, but who's to say that Jehovah won't

00:10:32.279 --> 00:10:36.279
be anointing more people years from now? And then they'll be

00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:41.279
reading about us in some updated version of the Proclamers book.

00:10:42.279 --> 00:10:47.279
Well, the answer is simple. Anyone anointed years from now would

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:51.279
not have been a contemporary of those of the first group of anointed

00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:55.279
ones because they have passed off the scene. And Jesus said,

00:10:55.279 --> 00:11:00.279
this generation will not pass away until all these things happen.

00:11:00.279 --> 00:11:05.279
They would not have been part of the generation. Now those of

00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:09.279
the second group of anointed ones are getting older. This is

00:11:09.279 --> 00:11:12.279
especially clear when you consider who make up the second group.

00:11:12.279 --> 00:11:15.279
We saw some pictures of those who made up the second group,

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:23.279
but in addition, there are Carl Klein, John Barr, Albert Schroeder.

00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:27.279
All of the current members of the governing body are also part

00:11:27.279 --> 00:11:32.279
of this generation, and some of us are showing our age.

00:11:32.279 --> 00:11:37.279
So brothers, we are indeed living deep in the time of the

00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:41.279
end. Now is no time for any of us to get weary.

00:11:41.279 --> 00:11:45.279
So let's all heed Jesus' counsel. The counsel found it

00:11:45.279 --> 00:11:50.279
Matthew 24-42. Keep on the watch, therefore, because you

00:11:50.279 --> 00:11:53.279
do not know on what day your Lord is coming.
