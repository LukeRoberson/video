WEBVTT

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:05.629
When we build strong faith in times of peace,

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.230
we can find courage during times of testing and persecution.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.630
Brother Rocky Webb, from the United States,

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.230
learned to be a fighter as a young man.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.030
But as his faith grew, he learned that Jehovah is there to help us

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:41.100
and to fight our battles.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.700
All of us are going to be tested one way or the other

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.009
before we back it into the New World.

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:55.009
And if we can endure those tests faithfully, faithfully,

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:59.439
then you'll make it.

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:02.439
My dad and my mother taught me the truth.

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:09.439
What drove me to be baptized was the convention in Washington, D.C.

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.439
Brother Rutherford gave the talk on the make-shell inherit the earth.

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:18.439
But it touched my heart in a way that it's ever left

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.439
from the better don't.

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:26.439
Right on up to now, gave me faith to stay with you over all the way.

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:31.939
The bullies would cover Jehovah to me,

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.939
and I would come home pretty well beat up.

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.939
So that's when I started trading for boxing.

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.939
I was offered $40,000 for a fight, when I lose.

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.939
And if I won the second fight, they would double the amount.

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.939
Brother McMillan was like a second dad to me and my brother.

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:57.939
And he asked me, says, would you do me a favor?

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:00.939
He says, don't put the gloves on no more.

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.939
And so I didn't put them on anymore.

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:10.939
I think he knew that it wouldn't be very long for an article on it.

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:15.939
It came out and told me that boxing wasn't for the Christians.

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:20.939
I was drafted during this time, and I refused to serve,

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.939
and it was sent to prison.

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:26.939
All the time, I never, never, ever,

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:31.939
slowed down on my their credit deals, never.

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:33.939
I kept right on on it.

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:38.939
The jail warden overheard me witnessing to another end mate.

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:41.939
He told me, don't do any more of that,

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:43.939
so we don't allow it here.

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:49.939
Three days from past by, and he seen me talking to him again.

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:54.939
And they put me in a car that was shaded.

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:58.310
He couldn't see out.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.310
I didn't know where I was going.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.310
No old prison.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.310
Just dark as it could be in there.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.310
It was three feet around.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.310
And they called it the sweat box.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.590
All the time I was in there, just sweat, sweat, sweat.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:24.590
And I went in at 213 pounds.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.590
And I came out with 133 pounds.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.319
Psalm 144 says,

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.319
May Jehovah be praised,

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:42.319
who trains my hand for battle, my fingers for warfare.

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:48.569
Now I gave my life to get Jehovah my faith.

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.569
I lived and we woke up.

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.569
Several congregations would come together to work.

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.569
We were confronted by mobs.

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.569
There was a lot of them that was injured.

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.569
I had 80 stitches turned up here.

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:12.569
And I had the 13 in the side there on each tab.

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.569
I was really, really beat up.

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:21.939
But I couldn't have stood up if it hadn't been for Jehovah.

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:26.509
I knew he was with me somewhere and other.

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:32.509
So we sued the town and won $20,000.

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:37.509
The Society called us and said,

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.509
you did very good in what all you've done.

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:43.509
But says remember,

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:46.509
we're not out for money.

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:50.509
Make sure that that's made known to them.

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:52.509
When we walked up to the desk,

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:55.509
we slid the papers out to us.

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:57.509
It says, sign them up.

00:04:57.509 --> 00:04:59.509
We just took and slid them back.

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:03.209
It came out in the papers.

00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:07.209
Tell them to come back and do all they want to do

00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:10.209
in a way of their witness.

00:05:11.209 --> 00:05:13.209
It says we won't touch them.

00:05:13.209 --> 00:05:18.209
They were really highly respected for what we did.

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:21.209
And so that opened it up.

00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:26.209
And you've had a real good congregation there,

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:38.100
got started and everything.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.100
My first life was a blessing for me.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:46.100
When she died, Jehovah stepped in and gave me another good one.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.100
We both along together.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.100
Now we do most of the thing together.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.100
We started to feel it in her heart.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.100
When you give your faith to Jehovah,

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.100
you give your life to him.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.100
He's permitted these things to come upon me.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.100
I knew that.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.100
But he protected me.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:17.589
Brother Webb is now 94 years old.

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:20.589
But as we saw, he and his wife, Charlene,

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:23.589
keep themselves spiritually active.

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:27.589
What lessons did you see in Rocky's experience?

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:31.589
For one, we heard that Rocky learned to be a boxer

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:34.589
to protect himself from bullies.

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:38.589
Yet he responded in faith to loving counsel to quit,

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:42.589
even before God's people had a clear understanding

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:44.589
of violent sports.

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:48.589
Making that change help Rocky to continue cultivating

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:51.589
a Christ-like personality.

00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:56.589
That prepared him to stand firm when in prison for his faith.

00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:59.589
And it helped him to not return evil for evil

00:06:59.589 --> 00:07:02.589
when persecuted for his ministry.

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:05.589
He had faith that although Jehovah permitted these things

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:10.589
to happen, he was also there to protect him.

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:12.589
Examples like those of Rocky

00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:16.589
and the others we've considered warm our hearts.

00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:21.589
And let us know we're never alone in our fight for the faith.
