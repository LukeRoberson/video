00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:08.140
Our text for today introduces a number of qualifications for an overseer in the congregation.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:16.140
However, by extension, the encouragement to reach out or to set our heart on making spiritual progress

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.140
applies to all of us.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.140
The Watchtower comment at the end says this,

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.140
In light manner, brothers and sisters who desire to serve as pioneers as battle lights

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:37.140
or as kingdom hall construction volunteers do well to stretch forward to attain their goals.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:46.140
We all know that the Apostle Paul here did not encourage anyone to ambitiously strive for a certain office or a certain status.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.140
It is not about the appointment or the office as a minister of servant or an elder.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:01.140
And it's not about the appointment as a pioneer, battle light, assembly hall servant or kingdom hall construction volunteers here.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:12.140
Paul encouraged here to reach out in an effort to qualify for responsible work in Jehovah's organization.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.140
Today we want to talk about the why.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:23.140
Why would brothers want to work hard as the Watchtower comment says to qualify for assignments in the congregation?

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:32.140
And sisters now have more spiritual goals than ever that they can reach out for such as SKE, Gilead and other spiritual goals.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:41.140
Why would we all, regardless of whether we are brothers or sisters, stretch forward to attain spiritual goals?

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.140
We'd like to highlight three main reasons.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.140
Let us open first of all to Matthew chapter 5.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:59.140
Here in Matthew chapter 5 in verses 14 and 15, Jesus uses the illustration of a lamp that gives light.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.450
Now let's look at verse 16 as we want to see his conclusion.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.449
Likewise, let your light shine before man so that they may see your fine works.

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:17.449
And give glory to your father who is in the heavens.

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:27.449
So the most important reason for working hard to make spiritual progress is our desire to glorify or praise Jehovah.

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:35.449
It's not the way how Jehovah administers his sovereignty and love a great motivating force to reach out.

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:48.449
Additionally, consider and Jehovah's mercy with us imperfect humans, his patience in helping us and his promise to protect us in these troubles sometimes.

00:02:48.449 --> 00:03:04.449
So Jesus had good reasons to tell us, my father is glorified in this that you keep bearing much fruit and prove yourself my disciples according to John 15 verse 8.

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:14.449
So in this sense, who of us can rightfully say it's enough, it's time to relax.

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:17.449
Let's just maintain the status quo.

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:25.449
The country is the case. We work hard, for example, cultivating the footage of the spirit in order to reflect Jehovah's wonderful personality.

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:35.449
In fact, the Apostle Paul uses the illustration of a mirror reflecting Jehovah's glory according to 2 Corinthians 3 verse 18.

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:46.449
So making spiritual progress is like polishing our mirror in order to better praise Jehovah.

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:54.449
Can we see the smile of approval from Jehovah as he watches us as he sees the efforts of each one of us?

00:03:54.449 --> 00:04:03.449
Now, what is the reason number two for our efforts in attaining spiritual goals for our reaching out to improve our qualifications?

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:07.449
Let us please turn to 1 Timothy chapter 4.

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:13.449
The young Timothy must have displayed a maturity beyond his years.

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:22.449
According to chapter 4 verse 14, Paul reminded Timothy that he had been appointed to carry responsibilities in the congregation.

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:27.449
Why would Timothy need to continue making spiritual progress?

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.449
Now, let us read chapter 4 verse 15.

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:42.860
Ponder over these things. Be absorbed in them so that your advancement may be plainly seen by all people.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:50.860
So Timothy's advancements in connection with his spiritual qualities would be seen by all people.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:57.860
So the second reason for reaching out or forward to attain our spiritual goals is that others benefit.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:09.860
For example, if we reach our goals in the ministry when it comes to the amount of time that we spend there or the quality of our conversations, then others will benefit.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.860
People in the territory and our brothers.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:26.860
Brothers working on their spiritual qualities so that they, one day, can serve as a ministry of serving or an elder, all of this can be seen by others and they benefit from their efforts.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:35.860
Others will benefit from us serving at an assembly hall or working in the Kingdom Hall construction or a renovation project.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:44.860
Our brothers and sisters need every help and every word of encouragement from each one of us.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.860
And therefore, we all work hard to continue making spiritual progress.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:56.860
Since we have not stopped doing exactly this, we might say we have been able to inspire others to do the very same.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.860
It is contagious and we all continue to grow.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:07.860
Now, let's look at the third reason for our earnest efforts in attaining spiritual goals.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.860
Reason number three is we ourselves benefit from it.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:18.860
Now, this seems to be a contradiction because we are encouraged to reach out to work hard.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.860
How can we ourselves benefit from it?

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.860
Now, let's turn to Hebrews chapter 5 in order to find out in which way we benefit ourselves.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.860
Paul describes here this process of making spiritual progress.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:39.860
And here in chapter 5 verses 11 to 13, he describes the brothers as little children.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:46.860
Small children constantly need help and guidance even in very basic things.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.860
Otherwise, they are confused and helpless and frustrated.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:07:01.860
But now, let's see what Paul describes here about mature people in verse 14 and we continue reading in chapter 6 verse 1.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:13.860
He says here, but solid food belongs to mature people to those who, through use, have their powers of discernment trained to distinguish both right and wrong.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:25.860
Therefore, now that we have moved beyond the primary doctrine about the Christ, let us press on to maturity, not laying a foundation again and so on.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:31.860
So, Paul tells us here, make spiritual progress.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:38.860
This is something that does not happen automatically. He says, press on, go forward.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.860
So, what is the benefit from us?

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:47.860
As Paul describes here, it will allow us to distinguish both right and wrong.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.860
In other words, we can make good decisions.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.860
And there is another benefit in this connection.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.860
Making spiritual advancement brings contentment.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.860
It makes us happy.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.860
As long as we work hard to attain our spiritual goals, we will see progress.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:11.860
Sometimes just baby steps, sometimes two steps ahead, and then sometimes one step back.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:20.860
But anyway, by doing this, we ensure that we are content and happy servants of Jehovah.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:31.860
Now, in summary, each one of us, whether we are brother or sister, needs to continue reaching out and stretching forward to attain spiritual goals.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:35.860
Why? Because Jehovah deserves it.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.860
And because others will benefit from it.

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:48.860
But then also it's a key for us to succeed as a mature, content, and happy servant of Jehovah.
