00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:06.929
Had you chosen to spend your vacation in Venezuela,

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:11.009
you could have climbed a snow-covered mountain,

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:16.850
taken a ride in the world's highest and longest cable car,

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.649
ridden horseback across seemingly endless plains,

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:25.649
observing the unique fauna, or contemplated

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:29.890
that we monoliths on the Grand Sabana,

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.969
or flown over the world's highest waterfall,

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:39.009
or simply relaxed on the white sands of a Caribbean beach,

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:44.960
just a few of the things that Venezuela has to offer.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.039
And with gasoline at four U.S. cents a gallon,

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:56.719
yes, you heard correctly, four U.S. cents a gallon,

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.759
sounds like paradise already, doesn't it?

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:03.759
Well, not really.

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:08.719
The economic situation in Venezuela is precarious,

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:12.959
and there are daily shortages of just about everything

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:15.920
from sugar to shampoo.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.239
In the last few months, too, we have been through a massive

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:26.799
epidemic of Chikungonia, which is an unpleasant African flu.

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.840
So the people in Venezuela need a message of hope.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.719
Now, just about everybody in Venezuela

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:37.680
believes in God and the Bible.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.599
So this makes the peaching work very enjoyable.

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:45.359
All have the opportunity to hear the Kingdom message

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:48.719
in the crowded slums of the big cities,

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:52.640
or in the Andean mountain villages,

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:59.040
or along the 2,800 kilometers of Caribbean coastline.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.239
And we also have a motorized boat

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:04.879
in order to reach those who live on the banks

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:07.680
of the Amazon tributaries.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:16.159
Now, last year, we had a peak of 140,226 publishers,

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:22.319
which now means a ratio of 1 to 214.

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.800
The memorial attendance was encouraging

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:35.280
two with 467,390 being present to commemorate Christ death.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.560
Regular pioneers, yes, we have 26,930 of them,

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.439
which means that one in every five witnesses in Venezuela

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:51.919
enjoys this facet of service.

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:55.199
All in all, Jehovah Servants in Venezuela

00:02:55.199 --> 00:03:00.159
are living up to his name, and a tremendous witness

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:02.800
is being given nationwide.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.120
And not just in Spanish.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.919
There are congregations and groups in Arabic, Chinese, English,

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:18.479
German, Haitian Creole, Italian, Portuguese, Ecuadorian

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:22.719
Quichua, Russia, Russian, and in Venice,

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:24.639
Wales and Sign Language.

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.719
And not to be overlooked, are several indigenous languages,

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:31.919
the largest being Waiunaiki.

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:36.719
Our remote translation offices translate into Warao,

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:41.520
Pieroa, PemÃ³n, and Yucpa.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.439
Now, an experience to illustrate how opportunities to preach

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:49.599
can present themselves when we least expect.

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.520
Our brother, Rigoberto, is a taxi driver,

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.439
and he was called out to transport the mourners

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:01.360
from the funeral home to the cemetery,

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.120
only to find the family very upset

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.199
because the Roman Catholic priest had not arrived

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:11.520
to give the funeral talk.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.560
So Rigoberto suggested to the family that

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.720
if they wanted, he could say a few appropriate words from the Bible.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.560
And they agreed, and he gave a five-minute talk,

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.759
sharing with them comforting verses and distributing copies

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:33.600
of the tract, what hope for dead loved ones.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.199
Now, the family of the deceased was most grateful

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:40.079
and offered him the money that they had collected

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:41.920
for the Catholic priest.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.160
Of course, our brother declined.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.560
And the owner of the funeral home he had observed all of this,

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.879
and he commented that, in effect,

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:55.279
the family had benefited for a two-for-one deal,

00:04:55.279 --> 00:05:00.240
a ride to the cemetery with a complimentary funeral talk thrown in

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.399
at no extra charge.

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:08.959
And to illustrate the respect that many still have

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:11.839
for Jehovah's people in Venezuela,

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:14.959
a few months ago, one Sunday evening,

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:18.480
circuit overseer Jose Medina and his wife,

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.199
Natua, were held up by three armed gunmen.

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:27.759
Now, the gunmen made off with their vehicle and their belongings.

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:32.079
But 30 minutes later, the thieves called a brother,

00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:37.680
whose number was listed in System Medina's cell phone directory.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.480
They confessed that they had been unaware

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.839
that their victims were Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:47.839
They apologized for the trouble and explained that the car

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:50.720
could be retrieved in a nearby street

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.319
where they had left the vehicle intact.

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:57.519
Very special people are Venezuelans.

00:05:57.519 --> 00:06:02.879
You can't help but love them.

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:07.439
Now, finally, with recently completed

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:11.279
the construction of our mini-patterson,

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:17.439
the Venezuela branch is very own educational center adjacent to Bethel,

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:22.639
where we will hold classes of the school for kingdom evangelizers.

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:26.319
It consists of a residence building for the students

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:30.560
and the instructors, a classroom and offices,

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.040
a dining room and kitchen.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.639
And on the same site is an expandable kingdom hall

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:40.079
used by the three local congregations and, of course,

00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:44.720
expanded for the assemblies of two nearby circuits.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.439
So, brothers, to all those present here,

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:50.240
we take the opportunity to share with you

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.279
the warm love and greetings from all those serving at the branch in Venezuela.
