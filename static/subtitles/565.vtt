00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:10.220
Welcome Mark if he comes to you clearly the Apostle Paul valued Mark and his services

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:16.579
Now we can imagine how we would feel if a member of the governing body wrote to a congregation and mentioned us by name and said

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:18.579
Please welcome us

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:25.059
That shows a lot of confidence and trust in us. So we know from this phrase how Paul felt about Mark

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:32.179
But how do you think that Mark felt when he read or he heard about what Paul had said?

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.700
Of course he had more reason to have this mean something to him more

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:47.299
Because of what it happened 10 years or more ago. He still remembers that incident with Paul and Barnabas at sharp burst of anger

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:50.939
Whether to take him along or not and

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.380
Paul made it very clear on that occasion. He did not want to take Mark along

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.179
Paul was really upset with Mark

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.619
Paul took Silas instead of Mark along and

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:06.780
Mark may have felt bad that he had created a rift

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.579
between two brothers that he really respected

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:18.219
So what can we learn from how Mark reacted when Paul didn't want to take him along?

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:24.980
Well, first of all, we don't know all the reasons why Mark left in the middle of an assignment to return to Jerusalem

00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:29.260
But for the sake of our discussion. Let's consider two possibilities

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.180
Was Mark misunderstood

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.739
Now Mark may have felt that he left that assignment for very good reasons

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.579
But obviously Paul did not agree that it was a good reason to leave his assignment

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.140
Or it could be that Mark made a mistake in his decision to leave his assignment

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.180
He left out of fear or some other situation in Jerusalem

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.739
And it could be even afterwards that Mark agreed that he had made a mistake

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.659
Now whichever case it was whether Mark was misunderstood or he made a mistake

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.459
How did Mark handle the situation?

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.020
Well, let's consider three lessons one he communicated

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.060
Now Mark may have tried to explain why he left the assignment and

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:22.300
Clearly from the Bible record Barnabas tried to explain it

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.740
But maybe that's what happened to Barnabas was trying to explain to Paul

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:33.180
This is why Mark left and explaining it and the more he explained it the more their apostle Paul was like no, I disagree

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.710
Lesson for us

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:38.750
communicate

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:46.509
Many misunderstandings can be cleared up by communicating once the other person understands what happened or the situation

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.069
The misunderstanding can be cleared up

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.509
Maybe though

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:56.990
Because of the situation you feel like well, I really don't want to talk to that person

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:03.949
I really don't feel like explaining to them what happened. You tell yourself. I know how this conversation is going to go

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:11.629
But still give your brother or sister the dignity of explaining the situation to them

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.949
Of course as the situation with Mark and Barnabas and Paul illustrates

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:23.949
You can't always change people's minds by explaining it in more and more detail to them

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:29.469
They still may disagree and feel that you made a poor decision

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:36.159
What's a second lesson that we can learn from how Mark handled the situation

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:39.439
He kept working

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.680
Now when Barnabas asked him to go along with him and Paul decided to take Silas

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.439
Mark didn't say to Barnabas, you know what

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.759
Based on how Paul treated me with this whole situation

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:58.479
I'm not going anywhere on any more assignments. I'm going back to the life I had before

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:06.000
No, in fact over the next 10 to 15 years Mark was busy. He worked with Barnabas

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.879
He worked with the apostle Peter

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:16.800
Later he wrote the gospel of Mark which we feel is based a lot on the first hand accounts that he learned from the apostle Peter

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:25.519
So he didn't let that incident discourage him from moving forward and doing what he could to help the kingdom work

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.399
Well, that's a good lesson for us keep working

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.120
Paul gave this good advice to Timothy in 1 Timothy chapter 4 and verse 10

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:41.680
This is this is why we are working hard and exerting ourselves

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:50.079
Because we have rested our hope in a living God who is a savior of all sorts of men, especially of faithful ones

00:04:51.519 --> 00:05:02.560
So you see the good advice there by working hard and exerting ourselves we can be in the same way as the one we are working hard

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.319
working hard

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:11.120
And exerting ourselves we can be faithful ones and Mark proved himself to be a faithful one

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.199
Whatever assignment we have keep working

00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:20.879
Don't let a misunderstanding or a mistake derail our service to Jehovah

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:28.160
granted it that's not always easy to do it takes strong love for Jehovah and for other people to get back to work

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:32.639
After we've had a misunderstanding or sometimes made a mistake

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.160
We need strength to avoid saying to ourselves

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:43.439
I'm never going to be useful to these brothers again my overseers will never give me another assignment or trust me

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:47.439
All of us make mistakes

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:50.000
Now I don't say that in the way that some people do you know

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.240
Sometimes they make a mistake and they say why everybody makes mistakes is almost to try to justify that

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.240
It's okay to make mistakes

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:02.800
But the reason I'm saying all of us make mistakes is to remember that your overseers have also made mistakes

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:10.480
They've been there they have empathy when you make a mistake because they've also been in that same position at times

00:06:12.079 --> 00:06:15.600
Freely admitting that you made a mistake is a great step forward

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:20.800
Trying hard to justify yourself or make it sound like it really wasn't that bad

00:06:21.519 --> 00:06:28.560
Doesn't usually help our cause that doesn't keep us from trying but we it doesn't normally help our cause much

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Owning up the mistakes we make

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:38.480
Working hard to repair any damage done can go a long way to rebuilding that trust

00:06:40.829 --> 00:06:44.430
A third lesson we can learn is that Mark did not write Paul off

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:49.949
He didn't say to himself. I am never going to work with Paul again

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.790
I'll work with Barnabas and Peter any of the other parcels

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:57.790
In fact, I'll work with anybody else, but I don't want to work with Paul again

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:03.230
Well, that's a good lesson for us. Don't write our overseer off

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:09.310
It's clear from today's text that Mark did good work for Paul

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:13.230
Paul appreciated his services if we look at 2nd Timothy

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:15.550
chapter 4 and verse 11

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.730
He says only Lucas with me

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:24.930
Bring Mark along with you for he's helpful to me in the ministry

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:31.649
So obviously when Mark had the chance again to work with the apostle Paul he did his best

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:38.689
Mark did not let that one event cloud his view of the privilege he had to assist the apostle Paul

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.050
Well, we can do the same as Mark

00:07:42.209 --> 00:07:50.769
If an overseer has been disappointed in something we said or did the next time you get a chance to work for them do your best

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:57.889
Now you don't want your overseer to hold that one event against you for the rest of your life

00:07:58.529 --> 00:08:04.769
So you shouldn't hold against him his reaction or his discipline against him for the rest of his life

00:08:06.829 --> 00:08:09.870
So in summary have you ever been in Mark's position

00:08:10.829 --> 00:08:13.629
Well, if you've been in special full-time service for some years

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:17.310
You have likely felt like Mark at least at some point

00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:21.389
Either through a misunderstanding or a mistake we made

00:08:21.949 --> 00:08:27.949
We disappointed our oversight or our actions cause some friction between other brothers

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:34.029
Our oversight may have made it clear that they were disappointed in us or

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.309
We may have been even given some strong counsel

00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:42.909
If that's been the case or it may even be the case of something you're dealing with right now

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:46.590
Please review how Mark dealt with the situation

00:08:47.549 --> 00:08:52.509
He communicated he kept working and he did not write Paul off

00:08:54.509 --> 00:08:59.710
Someday we hope you may have your welcome mark moment
