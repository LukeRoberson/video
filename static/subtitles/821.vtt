00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:08.039
Aren't we all glad that we are healthy enough to be able to listen to the Annual Meeting Program?

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:12.039
Yes, we don't want to take it for granted.

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:22.039
Worldwide, some 20,000 of our brothers and sisters died so far from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:32.039
But tens of thousands of our brothers and sisters, including many relatives, have been and are now affected emotionally by this fact.

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:39.039
Death toll affects friends and family, and the feeling of loss is deep.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:48.039
Secular sources say that the overall death rate in the United States is about 1% of the population each year.

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:55.039
Every year around the world an average of over 60 million people die.

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:00.039
The daily average is about 164,000.

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:03.770
How sad!

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.769
With a COVID-19 plague, the number of total death worldwide is of course higher.

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:17.769
In the United States, over 600,000 citizens died from COVID-19 alone.

00:01:17.769 --> 00:01:30.019
Even when tempered by the hope of the resurrection, the death of a loved one is still a traumatic loss which is deeply felt.

00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:40.019
Years perhaps decades of close companionship and sharing are suddenly and tragically ended.

00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:49.019
Of course, if those that died were part of our family, it affects you much more emotionally.

00:01:49.019 --> 00:01:58.019
We are also affected because we did not expect them to die, except perhaps if somewhere in the 80s or 90s.

00:01:58.019 --> 00:02:09.020
Even though you know that they will come back, you still feel hurt and are very sorry to have temporarily lost them.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:15.020
It is very sad to lose somebody in death, even temporarily, isn't it?

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:28.680
In the case of Lazarus, the Bible shows that even Jesus shed tears when he saw the emotional pain experienced by Lazarus' sisters.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:39.680
To be sad and to cry in the case of somebody's death is not an indication of somebody's lack of faith or an emotional imbalance.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.680
Never feel ashamed in such a case.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.680
Feel free to give way to tears.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:58.550
At John, chapter 5, 28 and 29, Jesus promises comforting.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.550
He said,

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:19.550
Do not be amazed at this because the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear the Son of God's voice and come out, those who did good things to a resurrection of life, those who practiced wild things to a resurrection of judgment.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:33.550
However, Jehovah foretold that sickness and death will not continue forever, but a temporary now and will soon end as the new world arrives.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:47.550
Even in the past, Jehovah miraculously proved that he is able to prevent sickness and subsequent death, and he proved that he has the power to bring back humans to life.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:04:03.550
As much as we are sorry to have lost relatives and or friends in death due to COVID-19 or any other reason, we can rejoice that Jehovah will bring them back in the resurrection.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:09.550
Jehovah brought back some of his servants in the resurrection in the past.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.550
The Bible speaks of nine specific resurrections of individuals.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:21.550
Instead of reading a list with their names, you can try to recall who these persons were.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:30.550
If you don't come up with the nine persons, why not make it a part of a conversation with friends to complete the list?

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.550
It refers to Jesus and eight additional ones.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.550
It is so encouraging and comforting to talk about it.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:57.550
Hebrews 11.35 speaks of a better resurrection, better than the resurrection of the eight persons mentioned in the Bible, who had to die again at the later day.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:08.550
The future resurrection is better because it contains the possibility to never die again in all eternity.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:22.550
Imagine to live not only for a thousand years, but for a million years, for ten million years, for a hundred million years, for a hundred billion years, and so on.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:38.899
As for those being brought back in the resurrection, the resurrection will be perceived like having happened in the blink of an eye after their death, although they may have been dead for quite some time.

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:46.899
For instance, when Lazarus was resurrected, he did not recall that he was laying in the tomb.

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:54.899
When he was resurrected, to him it was like the next moment after he lost consciousness from dying.

00:05:54.899 --> 00:06:00.899
When he came to himself, he had no perception that he was in the tomb.

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:07.899
Jehovah created man originally. He can also recreate a human.

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:17.899
Psalm 104, 29 and 30 say, when you hide your face, they are disturbed.

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:22.899
If you take away their spirit, they die and return to the dust.

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:26.899
If you send out their spirit, they are created.

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:32.899
Jehovah will give the resurrected ones a body just as it pleases him.

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:43.899
Their bodies will be physically sound and obviously look similar to their original body, so that they will be recognized by their loved ones.

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:52.899
Faithful Christians who die late during the time of the end will likely be among the first ones to be raised again.

00:06:52.899 --> 00:07:03.899
We can also expect an early resurrection for some of the faithful men of old who will join others as princes in a new world.

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:08.899
Nevertheless, we should not be dogmatic on such matters.

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:13.899
On many issues related to the resurrection, the Bible is silent.

00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:23.899
It does not spell out details of how, when or at what locations the resurrection of individuals will occur.

00:07:23.899 --> 00:07:30.899
It does not tell us how those returning will be housed, fed and clothed.

00:07:30.899 --> 00:07:38.899
It would be unwise to spend a lot of time trying to find answers that are at present unanswerable.

00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:46.300
It is best to just focus on the fact of the resurrection to come.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:58.300
First Corinthians 15, 52 also speaks of the resurrection, but not of an earthly resurrection, but a heavenly spiritual one.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:06.300
This text refers to anointed ones who would die and be raised in the blink of an eye.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:11.300
This resurrection began during our time, the time of the end.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:18.300
When they die, they go to heaven in an instant, like during the blink of an eye.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:31.300
But those who have the earthly hope to live forever on earth in paradise also will have the same perception later when they will be resurrected in the paradise.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:40.299
The time from their death to the moment of their resurrection will not be consciously experienced by them.

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:45.740
It will be for them like the blinking of an eye.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:50.740
Those resurrected to heaven will obtain immortality.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:09:00.740
Those resurrected on earth will not be immortal, but have the chance to live forever as long as they remain faithful.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:11.179
In connection with the ancient Israelites, Jehovah also proved that she is able to protect his people from sicknesses.

00:09:11.179 --> 00:09:15.179
And he did it when the Israelites remained faithful.

00:09:15.179 --> 00:09:27.559
To Tronomy 715 foretold in connection with those who escaped from Egypt, Jehovah will take away from you all sickness,

00:09:27.559 --> 00:09:36.000
and he will not bring upon you any of the terrible diseases that you have known in Egypt.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
We can trust that Jehovah fulfilled his promise.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
He did so when the Israelites were faithful.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
He blessed the Israelites with good health and long life.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
This shows his past love for the people of Israel.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:03.379
It also indicates his power and that if he wishes to repeat this miracle, he can do it of course.

00:10:03.379 --> 00:10:11.379
He will do so after Armageddon during the millennium or a thousand year reign of Christ.

00:10:11.379 --> 00:10:17.379
Revelation 22 verse 2 foretells the healing of the nations.

00:10:17.379 --> 00:10:23.379
This includes physical and emotional healing in the new world.

00:10:23.379 --> 00:10:30.379
Death is really an enemy, but Jehovah will do a way with it.

00:10:30.379 --> 00:10:36.379
Isaiah 33, 24, it says that in the new world, quote,

00:10:36.379 --> 00:10:53.289
no resident will say, I am sick. There will be no hospitals, there will be no drugstores, there will be no physicians, there will be no professional nurses.

00:10:53.289 --> 00:11:02.289
In Revelation 21, 4, it foretells that in the new world there will be neither morning nor outcry nor pain anymore.

00:11:02.289 --> 00:11:15.820
We are very sad about what happened around the world with so many of our brothers and sisters falling asleep from COVID-19 recently, but we know they will come back.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:22.820
They will come back healthy, they will not come back looking like old people.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:30.820
Even if they died at 80 years, they might look like they are in their 30s when resurrected.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:40.820
As stated earlier, they will look reasonably similar to their original body so that they will be recognized by their loved ones.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:51.299
How it fills our hearts with love for Jehovah, that he will bring back in the resurrection our loved ones.

00:11:52.299 --> 00:12:00.299
The Apostle Paul had a firm hope. He explained at 2 Corinthians 1 verse 7,

00:12:00.299 --> 00:12:13.299
quote, our hope for you is unwavering, knowing as we do that, just as you are shares of the sufferings, in the same way you will also share the comfort.

00:12:16.179 --> 00:12:27.179
At the conclusion of his letter, Paul urged, continue to be comforted, and the God of love and of peace will be with you.

00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:32.500
What an important lesson we can learn from this.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:44.500
All members of the Christian congregation need to share the comfort that God provides through His Word, His Holy Spirit, and His earthly organization.

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:56.500
The principle source of comfort is, of course, Jehovah himself. There is no real lasting comfort that does not originate with God.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.500
Appropriately then, Paul wrote, quote,

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:12.500
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of tender mercies, and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our tribulation.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:25.059
What inspiring words, the Greek word here rendered comfort, is linked to a calling to one side.

00:13:25.059 --> 00:13:32.059
Therefore, it is the standing beside a person to encourage him when he is undergoing severe testing.

00:13:32.059 --> 00:13:36.440
One biblical scholar wrote,

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:42.440
The word always means far more than soothing sympathy.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:53.460
Christian comfort is the comfort which brings courage, the comfort which enables a man to cope with all that life can do to him.

00:13:53.460 --> 00:14:03.460
It also includes comforting words that are based on a solid promise and hope, that of the resurrection of the dead.

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:09.460
So what can we do to enhance the comfort to others?

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:17.460
Listen, one of the most helpful things you can do is to share the brief ones pain by listening.

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:22.460
You may ask, would you care to talk about it?

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:33.460
One Christian recalls when his father died, it really helped me when others asked what happened and then really listened.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:37.460
Listen patiently and sympathetically.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:44.460
Weep with people who weep recommends the Bible at Romans 12 verse 15.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:53.460
Be available, make yourself available not just for the first few days when many friends and relatives are present,

00:14:53.460 --> 00:15:01.460
but for months later, if necessary, when others have returned to their normal routine.

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:08.460
Our Christian interest and sympathy can mean so much in any time of need.

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:16.929
The Bible says that there exists a friend sticking closer than a brother.

00:15:16.929 --> 00:15:20.929
Talk about the good qualities of the deceased person.

00:15:20.929 --> 00:15:23.929
This is another great help.

00:15:23.929 --> 00:15:33.929
Share positive anecdotes that you recall about the individual and do not be afraid to use the person's name.

00:15:33.929 --> 00:15:37.929
Write a letter or send a comforting card.

00:15:37.929 --> 00:15:44.929
Often overlooked is the value of a condolence letter or a beautiful sympathy card.

00:15:44.929 --> 00:15:49.929
It's advantage, it can be read over and over again.

00:15:49.929 --> 00:15:57.940
Such a letter need not be long, but it should show your compassion.

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:06.940
Pray with them. Do not underestimate the value of your prayers with and for bereaved fellow Christians.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:15.940
The Bible says that James 516, a righteous man's supplication has much force.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:25.639
Encourage sufferers to meditate on Jehovah. He is the God of all comfort.

00:16:25.639 --> 00:16:34.639
He said in Isaiah, I, I myself am the one that is comforting your people.

00:16:34.639 --> 00:16:43.639
He also said, like a man whom his own mother keeps comforting, so I myself shall keep comforting you people.

00:16:43.639 --> 00:16:51.840
Find with me Psalm 119.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:57.840
Let's first read verses 50 and 52.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:04.839
This is my comfort in my affliction, for your saying has preserved me alive.

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:13.839
Verse 52, I remember your judgments from of old Old Jehovah and I find comfort in them.

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:26.839
And now, even verse 76, may you alloyal love please comfort me according to the promise you made to your servant.

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:32.839
Note that the word comfort is used repeatedly in those passages.

00:17:32.839 --> 00:17:43.839
Yes, we can find true comfort for ourselves and for others by turning to Jehovah's word in our time of affliction.

00:17:43.839 --> 00:17:56.839
This combined with love and compassion of the brothers can help us to live through our loss and fill our lives again with joyful activity in the Christian ministry.

00:17:56.839 --> 00:18:05.839
What a privilege to worship the Almighty, our loving God Jehovah, who will bring back our loved ones in the resurrection.

00:18:05.839 --> 00:18:18.839
There will never again be a pandemic to claim the life of faithful servants, because at that time no resident will say, I am sick.
