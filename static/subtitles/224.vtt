00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:08.349
This is JW Broadcasting reporting on the circumstances of our brothers in Liberia.

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:13.070
We have Phil O'Dell, with us, who serves on the Branch Committee in that country.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.589
We will hear how our brothers in Liberia have faired during the past few months during

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:19.070
the Ebola outbreak.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:44.770
Pearl is well aware of the Ebola virus in some countries in West Africa, and the global

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.090
concern that the disease would spread to epidemic proportions beyond that region.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.969
As mentioned, we have Phil O'Dell from Liberia here.

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:58.729
Phil, can you update us on the current situation?

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:00.210
Certainly.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.290
Liberia, along with Sierra Leone and Guinea, have been the country's hardest hit by the

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.489
deadly Ebola virus.

00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:13.049
This current outbreak started at the early part of 2014 in Guinea.

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:20.049
Since we have 6,400 publishers in Liberia and 125 paragations, we were naturally concerned

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:21.049
with this current.

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.530
Well, out of the branches in those countries respond.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.450
Very quickly, both of the branches in Sierra Leone and Liberia wrote letters to the congregations,

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.569
the traveling overseers, these letters instructed the brothers what they could do to protect

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:41.409
themselves and the congregations.

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:47.329
Suggestions included frequent handwashing, avoiding shaking hands and kissing as greetings,

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:49.969
avoiding contact with the sick.

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:56.329
Also avoiding the eating of bushmeats and avoiding some of the or many of the common burial

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.530
and funeral customs.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.849
For the memorial, all of the congregations were asked to set up handwashing stations outside

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:07.489
the venue for everyone attending.

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:14.969
But in spite of this looming concern, 76,000 attended the memorial, 11 times the number

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:16.330
of publishers we have.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.969
That is truly amazing.

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:23.650
Now, how has the situation progressed since then in Liberia?

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.090
In July, there was a sharp increase in the spread of the virus, especially hard hit was

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.449
the capital city, Monrovia.

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:36.129
The government declared a state of emergency and imposed a curfew.

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:44.849
As cases increased in number, many wondered how the August JW.org campaign would be affected.

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:45.849
Very interesting.

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:50.409
Were the brothers in that very special month of activity able to have a full share in

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:51.409
the ministry?

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.090
Yes, they were.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.530
Actually, 1,202 auxiliary pioneered that month.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.330
That was 19% of our publishers.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.610
The brothers and sisters looked for creative ways to witness.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.810
At the same time, they observed the safety measures such as washing their hands in a bleach

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.449
water solution before speaking with the householders.

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:20.530
And this was done a number of times throughout the day as they were in the service.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.849
Some did telephone witnessing.

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:28.849
Cellophones are widely used in Liberia, but because of the cost, conversations are often kept

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:29.849
short.

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:36.610
However, one of the major cell phone providers offered a promotion that for one US dollar,

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.650
they were given three days of unlimited calls.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.650
This allowed the publishers to safely call, return visits, and even conduct Bible studies

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.009
from their homes.

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:52.770
I'm encouraging that is that the organization helped in other ways.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.889
Well, disaster relief committees were set up in areas that were the hardest hit.

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:02.729
They made sure that the brothers and sisters had food and other basic necessities.

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:07.569
The elders communicated regularly to assess the situation, keeping the field service groups

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.729
away from the affected areas.

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:15.689
The congregations adjusted their meeting times to respect the curfew.

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:20.810
However, in one area, they did have to suspend their meetings for two months because there

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.889
were too many cases of Ebola.

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.649
Instead, each family conducted their own meetings with the different family members handling

00:04:28.649 --> 00:04:30.050
the various parts.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.769
Additionally, arrangements were made by the local elders and ministerial servants to visit

00:04:34.769 --> 00:04:40.370
different homes and give public talks and conduct a watchtower study.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.370
It is beautiful.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.810
It's so encouraging to hear that most of our dear brothers were able to enjoy the spiritual

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.129
food provided.

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:51.689
And from what you say, it sounds like the elders did a good job of shepherding.

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:54.769
Yes, they did extremely well.

00:04:54.769 --> 00:04:59.730
The disaster relief committees and traveling overseers made sure to make regular shepherding

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.649
visits on those who lost loved ones to the virus.

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:09.529
All the while, emphasizing the importance of following the clear guidelines and precautions

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:11.529
set out by the organization.

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:14.490
Well, let me ask you this.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:20.610
Did the branch office receive any comments on how we handled the Ebola threat?

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:27.089
We received many favorable remarks from those inside and outside of the organization.

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:34.129
One congregation wrote this, unknown to us, there was a healthcare volunteer who was sent

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:39.170
to the Kingdom Hall to teach us about the Ebola virus and its prevention.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:44.449
But after the meeting, he said this, I came here purposely to teach your congregation

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:49.649
about the Ebola virus, but the information you people had is more than what I came to

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:51.050
teach.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.649
When I entered the church yard, I saw a bucket with a soap water mixed with chlorox for

00:05:56.649 --> 00:05:58.889
washing hands.

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:03.810
Even the children were all in line for washing their hands.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.170
Thank you very much and please continue the fine work.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:13.050
We also forwarded the letters that we sent to the congregations regarding Ebola precautions

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.170
to the Liberia Ministry of Health and Social Welfare.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.689
We received the following comment via email.

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:27.129
The minister has instructed to convey his appreciation for your efforts in the fight against

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:28.610
the spread of Ebola.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:34.209
We hope that others will emulate your work towards this effort.

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:36.689
Very interesting.

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:45.050
Now, you took all the precautions that you could take, but realistically, individually,

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.810
we are not protected from the effects of such a pestilence.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:54.009
How many of our dear publishers have we lost?

00:06:54.009 --> 00:07:00.209
Sadly, at this point, 11 witnesses have died from Ebola in Liberia and one passed away

00:07:00.209 --> 00:07:02.089
in Sierra Leone.

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:07.410
One of those that died in Liberia were healthcare workers and three of the others were family

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.769
members of those health workers.

00:07:09.769 --> 00:07:16.569
Additionally, many of our fellow servants have lost unbelieving family members, so unfortunately,

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:23.449
many have experienced the sting of death in connection with this deadly virus.

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:29.410
I'm sure our brothers have been bolstered with the Resurrection Hope, which is held out

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:33.050
for fellow believers as well as family members.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:38.290
Notable to is a scripture at Romans chapter 14 and verse 8.

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:42.610
Under inspiration, it says this,

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:47.889
For if we live, we live to Jehovah.

00:07:47.889 --> 00:07:51.529
And if we die, we die to Jehovah.

00:07:51.529 --> 00:08:00.490
So both if we live and if we die, we belong to Jehovah.

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:06.889
So certain is the Resurrection that those who succumb to the disease are as still alive

00:08:06.889 --> 00:08:08.569
to our God.

00:08:08.569 --> 00:08:15.370
Phil, how has the Bethel family feared under this circumstance?

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:20.889
They are following the precautions and staying focused on their assignment and how they can

00:08:20.889 --> 00:08:22.689
support the ministry.

00:08:22.689 --> 00:08:28.250
Interestingly, when Liberia was seeing the sharp increase in Ebola cases, the majority

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:32.970
of the foreign servants like myself, we were out of the country to attend international

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:34.370
conventions.

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:41.049
So many of us did not face the brunt of the virus, but we all very much look forward to

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:43.090
returning to our assignments.

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:44.889
Yes, we can see that.

00:08:44.889 --> 00:08:49.929
Having you in our office, we know that you and your dear wife Jessica are eager to get

00:08:49.929 --> 00:08:52.970
back to the brothers and sisters there.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:58.450
And yet many are still facing daily the dilemma.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:03.129
Is there anything that you would like to say to our dear brothers in West Africa?

00:09:03.129 --> 00:09:05.889
Certainly.

00:09:05.889 --> 00:09:13.250
Brothers and sisters, it was prophesied that in the last days, there would be pestilence.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.690
Luke chapter 21 verse 11 makes it clear.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:23.250
It is part of the sign that the kingdom will soon end Satan's rule.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:29.169
Verse 36, however, encourages us all to keep awake.

00:09:29.169 --> 00:09:32.049
You friends are doing this very thing.

00:09:32.049 --> 00:09:37.610
You continue to preach, staying faithful, and Jehovah's direction through his organization

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.490
is clear.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:41.570
It is faith strengthening to me.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:48.799
It reminds me of the words at Proverbs chapter 18 and verse 10.

00:09:48.799 --> 00:09:57.360
There at Proverbs 18, 10, it says, the name of Jehovah is a strong tower into it.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:02.559
The righteous one runs and receives protection.

00:10:02.559 --> 00:10:06.960
You brothers and sisters have faithfully turned to Jehovah.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.559
For some, they are in the safest place there is.

00:10:11.559 --> 00:10:13.679
That's Jehovah's memory.

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:20.919
May all of us continue to run to Jehovah and his organization, and he will write all such

00:10:20.919 --> 00:10:25.029
wrongs everlastingly.

00:10:25.029 --> 00:10:29.629
I'm sure the brothers really appreciate those thoughts, Phil.

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:35.350
It's touching to see the willingness of the brothers to follow direction and to be obedient

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:37.230
to the direction given.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:43.149
And that reduces the amount of tragedy that our brothers have experienced.

00:10:43.149 --> 00:10:46.590
Thank you, Brother Odell, for being with us.

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:50.909
Now, we understand you're going to be returning to Liberia soon.

00:10:50.909 --> 00:10:55.629
Thank you, and yes, we are definitely looking forward to going back.

00:10:55.629 --> 00:11:00.789
We pray that Jehovah continues to give the branch committees and the local brothers

00:11:00.789 --> 00:11:06.429
in the region, wisdom, insight, and thinking ability.

00:11:07.149 --> 00:11:11.350
If you would like to learn more about our brothers in Liberia, you can watch the highlights

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:16.389
from the Liberia Branch dedication program held in 2013.

00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:23.830
It's available on video on demand under programs and events category.

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:28.429
Until next time, this is JW Broadcasting reporting from Brooklyn, New York.
