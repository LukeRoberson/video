00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.270
Everything I know about Kingdom Hall maintenance, I learned from Brother Hojin Komp.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:57.909
He encouraged me when I needed a little push, taught me the right way to do things,

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:08.609
and continued to teach me, with kindness and love.

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:22.379
So when he asked to borrow a ladder, I was happy to lend him mine.

00:01:22.379 --> 00:01:24.379
Here are some things I need.

00:01:24.379 --> 00:01:27.379
For a lunch today, with the youngs?

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:30.379
What's the ladder for?

00:01:30.379 --> 00:01:32.379
Hojin needs it.

00:01:32.379 --> 00:01:37.379
Hojin? How's he doing? I heard something about a cane.

00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:43.379
Hojin? A cane? No way. He's still as strong as an ox.

00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:47.379
Maybe. But it seems like...

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:50.379
Well, you'll see how he's doing.

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:53.379
And don't forget to stop at the store.

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:56.379
Hojin? A cane?

00:01:57.379 --> 00:01:58.379
No way.

00:01:58.379 --> 00:02:14.979
I'm coming. Here I come.

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:17.979
Oh, sorry.

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:19.979
It's okay. Is everything okay?

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:24.699
I just can't dash down the stairs.

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:27.699
I was on my way to the store, and that I'd drop off the ladder.

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:31.699
Thanks. Just leave it by the garage.

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:33.699
It's almost time for lunch.

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:37.699
The gutters can wait. They've waited this long.

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:40.699
Okay, we'll do. Bye.

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:41.699
Drive safe.

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:19.770
Gutters.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.360
Hi, honey. What about lunch?

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.360
The youngs will be here in an hour.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.360
I know. I picked up the items you asked for.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.180
It got me thinking about the neighborly Samaritan.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:43.099
When we see a knee, we can't be like the priest and Levite,

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:50.949
who just walked away.

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:54.949
The Samaritan cared enough to stop.

00:03:54.949 --> 00:04:07.729
Examine the knee and take the time to help the poor man.

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:13.539
A man he didn't even know.

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:15.539
Of course.

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:17.540
Work what is good toward all,

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.540
but especially toward those related to us in the faith.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.790
And I have an idea.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.790
Let's not cancel with the youngs.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.790
I'll go back and pick up my ladder and tell Hojin

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.790
that I'll come back Saturday afternoon to help him clean out the gutters.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:48.019
It's such a blessing to be able to care the needs of our brothers

00:04:48.019 --> 00:04:54.639
and feel their love and care for us.
