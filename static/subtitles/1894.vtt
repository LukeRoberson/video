00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:08.259
Welcome dear brothers and sisters, I'm so happy to share with you this update.

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:15.259
It's been amazing to see the kingdom work move ahead even during this pandemic.

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:26.260
Various branches are reporting all-time peaks in the number of publishers, pioneers, meeting attendants, and Bible studies.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.259
Many have reported peaks in the memorial attendance.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:42.259
For example, the Philippines branch reported that over 739,000 attended the memorial this year.

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:47.259
That's more than three times the number of publishers.

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:56.259
100 congregations, mostly in urban areas, reported a memorial attendance of at least 500.

00:00:56.259 --> 00:01:05.260
That means that 50,000 attended the memorial in just those 100 congregations.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.260
In various parts of the earth, many struggle to obtain food.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:19.260
With the assistance of hundreds of disaster relief committees, we continue to help our brothers.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:33.769
For example, in Venezuela, each month we are providing an average of 130 tons of food to 25,000 brothers in need.

00:01:33.769 --> 00:01:44.769
One 90-year-old pioneer sister said, I know that the aid comes from Jehovah, but he uses brothers that I do not even know.

00:01:44.769 --> 00:01:48.769
And yet they love me and help me.

00:01:48.769 --> 00:01:54.010
Thank you dear family.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:03.010
It's heartwarming to see how Jehovah is helping our brothers and sisters in Venezuela and around the globe.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:10.009
We thank all of you for making that possible by means of your donations.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:21.009
In our last governing body update Brother Heard mentioned that about 50% of the worldwide Bethel family have been vaccinated so far.

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:28.009
Initially, it seemed impossible to obtain vaccines in some countries of the world,

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:36.009
but it's been amazing to see that now more than 80% of our worldwide Bethel family,

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:51.009
that is more than 19,000 Bethelites, are vaccinated and we are doing what we can to assist the branch offices that have not been able to obtain vaccines.

00:02:52.009 --> 00:03:04.009
As you know, by keeping the Bethel family safe, we protect the flow of spiritual food and support spiritual activities worldwide.

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:16.009
On behalf of the governing body, thank you dear brothers and sisters for your tremendous cooperation with all the arrangements during the pandemic.

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:23.009
There have been many adjustments in a short time, but you have done so well.

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:32.009
We truly love you for your fine spirit in working shoulder to shoulder with us.

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:43.009
While we all have had changes in our routine, some of our circuit overseers who serve in foreign lands have had major changes.

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:48.009
They had to return to their home countries during the pandemic.

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:54.009
Even so, some continue to serve the congregations in their circuits via Zoom,

00:03:54.009 --> 00:04:00.009
despite being in a different country and in a different time zone.

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:05.310
Let's hear from one.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.310
A few months into the pandemic, my father's health was failing.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.310
So we made the decision to return to the states and assist my mother.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.310
Although in the beginning, we didn't think we would be here so long.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:25.310
It turned out that the surge in the pandemic prevented us from going back to our assignment in the circuit in Bolivia.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:32.310
Well, being this place, we just weren't sure if we were going to be able to serve and complete our assignment effectively.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.310
We felt that we needed to make the necessary adjustments to have the right attitude.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.310
So Fervent Prayer really helped us to get the right mindset

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:48.310
and being able to see how Jehovah answered those prayers is very faith-strengthening.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.310
Jehovah is blessing this arrangement.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.310
It's the arrangement that's been put in place and it's what we're using.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.310
We're making the best of it, but we're having success because Jehovah is behind it.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.310
We've had brothers who are now qualified to be publishers, unbaptized publishers.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.310
There's brothers who've dedicated their lives and gotten baptized during this pandemic.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:18.310
One brother in particular has so much enthusiasm for phone witnessing that last month he was able to report over 100 return visits

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.310
and he was able to show over 200 videos to different ones.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.310
One Bible student loves her study so much

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:30.310
and also attending meetings that she's willing to walk one hour each way

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:36.310
in order to have a good signal on her phone so she can tie into her study and also to the meetings.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.310
Throughout this past year I've learned that Jehovah has never left us.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.310
He's been in total control of every situation.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:52.310
He's been able to direct his organization, his people exactly in the place that we need to be.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.310
This has all been proof that Jehovah will never abandon us.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:07.519
How encouraging to hear how our brothers are remaining united and spiritually active.

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:12.519
But we do have to continue to guard our unity.

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:14.519
What is unity?

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:20.519
It's been defined as oneness, a condition of harmony.

00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:30.519
Note how the Apostle Paul describes our role in maintaining unity at Ephesians chapter 4 verse 3.

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:32.519
There we read,

00:06:32.519 --> 00:06:41.519
earnestly endeavoring to maintain the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace.

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:45.519
Note that it takes effort to maintain our unity.

00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:52.519
Paul said that we must earnestly endeavor or work hard at it.

00:06:52.519 --> 00:06:56.519
What could pose a danger to our unity?

00:06:56.519 --> 00:07:03.519
What if we became too emotionally involved in issues that are divisive?

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:10.519
The Bible foretold at 2 Timothy chapter 3 that men would be lovers of themselves,

00:07:10.519 --> 00:07:15.519
not open to any agreement and fears.

00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:18.519
We see this in the world today.

00:07:18.519 --> 00:07:21.519
People are not open to any agreement.

00:07:21.519 --> 00:07:24.519
They quickly become fierce,

00:07:24.519 --> 00:07:28.519
taking strong positions on all types of issues.

00:07:28.519 --> 00:07:32.519
As Christians, we are no part of the world.

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:36.519
We stay out of those debates.

00:07:36.519 --> 00:07:44.519
For example, who would have thought that wearing a mask to prevent the spread of disease could become an issue?

00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:53.519
From the time when we were little children, our parents taught us to cover our mouth when we coughed or sneezed.

00:07:53.519 --> 00:08:01.519
In his precious word, Jehovah outlined many practical measures that would prevent the spread of disease.

00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:05.519
So how could wearing a mask become controversial for some?

00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:09.519
Where is that thinking coming from?

00:08:09.519 --> 00:08:12.519
We have to be careful.

00:08:12.519 --> 00:08:20.519
All of us are exposed to worldly thinking on television, on the internet, at work, or at school.

00:08:20.519 --> 00:08:25.519
There are many websites that promote conspiracy theories.

00:08:25.519 --> 00:08:32.519
If we are not careful, we could become emotionally involved in these debates.

00:08:32.519 --> 00:08:43.519
We could allow ourselves to be guided by the voice of strangers, instead of listening to Jehovah's Channel, the faithful and discreet slave.

00:08:43.519 --> 00:08:53.519
As we face the end of this system of things, this will become more and more essential to our safety and spirituality.

00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:59.519
That's why we appreciate you dear brothers and sisters so much.

00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:08.519
As soon as you discern that Jehovah's Spirit is directing the governing body to go in a certain way, you are quick to follow.

00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:14.519
And as a result, we enjoy precious unity.

00:09:14.519 --> 00:09:19.519
This reminds me of the Bible example of Nehaman.

00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:23.519
Through a messenger, the prophet Elisha told Nehaman,

00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:29.519
it be healed from his leprosy if he bathed seven times in the Jordan River.

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:33.519
How did Nehaman react?

00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:40.519
Let's read together, 2 Kings 5, 11 and 12.

00:09:40.519 --> 00:09:46.519
At this Nehaman became indignant and started to leave, saying,

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:57.519
here I say to myself, he will come out to me and stand here and call on the name of Jehovah, his God, moving his hand back and forth over the leprosy to cure it.

00:09:57.519 --> 00:10:04.519
Are not the abayna and the far power, the rivers of Damascus better than all the waters of Israel?

00:10:04.519 --> 00:10:12.519
Can I not wash in them and become clean? With that he turned and went away in a rage.

00:10:12.519 --> 00:10:18.519
Nehaman had his own idea about how he was going to be cured.

00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:24.519
He felt strongly about it, but Jehovah had a different idea.

00:10:24.519 --> 00:10:32.519
To be cured Nehaman would have to humble himself and follow direction from Jehovah's Channel.

00:10:32.519 --> 00:10:37.519
Nehaman was struggling, but his servants got the point.

00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:41.519
What did they tell him to do? And what was the result?

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:45.519
Let's read in verses 13 and 14.

00:10:45.519 --> 00:10:50.120
His servants now approached him and said,

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:57.120
my father, if the prophet had told you to do something extraordinary, would you not do it?

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:03.120
How much more than since he only said to you, wash and be clean?

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:12.120
At that he went down and plunged into the Jordan seven times according to the word of the man of the true God.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:21.120
Then his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little boy and he became clean.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:32.120
Do we get the point? Like Nehaman, we might struggle a bit at times, especially if we have our own strong viewpoint.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:39.120
But one thing is certain, if we follow direction coming from Jehovah's Channel, we will be blessed

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:44.120
and more important, we will remain united.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:52.120
Of course, the devil is not happy to see this cooperation, this beautiful unity that we enjoy.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:57.120
So we have to be on guard so as to maintain it.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:05.120
This reminds me of an event in my life many years ago when this lesson was impressed on my mind.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:12.120
At that time, some of the brothers did become divided and it led to so many problems.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:17.120
You may remember that we had a video about those events.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.120
Let's watch a clip from that video.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:26.549
A lot of pressure was on the brothers in Romania.

00:12:26.549 --> 00:12:32.549
The Communist Party tried to so distrust among the brothers,

00:12:32.549 --> 00:12:40.549
meeting with them separately and telling some brothers one thing, telling other brothers something else.

00:12:40.549 --> 00:12:52.549
Sometimes it has happened that an official posed as an interested person and was clever enough to disguise that and pretend to make progress in the truth.

00:12:52.549 --> 00:12:59.549
Not only to the point of getting baptized, but even to the point of becoming an elder.

00:12:59.549 --> 00:13:08.549
But he was in reality an agent of the secret police with the aim to find out everything about the organization.

00:13:08.549 --> 00:13:18.549
So it did lead in one case that brothers started to distrust someone that was actually appointed by headquarters.

00:13:18.549 --> 00:13:26.549
And these brothers then separated from the organization that Jehovah used.

00:13:26.549 --> 00:13:32.549
And some of them were separated for not just a few years but for decades.

00:13:32.549 --> 00:13:37.549
And they were a large number up to 5,000 publishers.

00:13:37.549 --> 00:13:39.549
They continued to meet together.

00:13:39.549 --> 00:13:45.549
They were preaching and using material that they had left over from earlier years.

00:13:45.549 --> 00:13:54.549
But they hardly got any new material to study because they were not in touch with the organization that was used for headquarters.

00:13:54.549 --> 00:14:01.549
Attempts to bring the brothers back into the organization were made from time to time.

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:08.549
But it seemed that the brothers from the separated organization did not have sufficient trust.

00:14:08.549 --> 00:14:19.549
But when we presented to the leader of the separated group that one from the governing body would come,

00:14:19.549 --> 00:14:31.549
he was happy about that and he had enough trust in that case to agree that we should have a meeting and seriously talk about reunification.

00:14:31.549 --> 00:14:40.549
And so from the separated group there were brother Albu who was the leader and four of his main elders.

00:14:40.549 --> 00:14:48.549
And from our side there was brother Jerez, our translator, and I was part of that group.

00:14:48.549 --> 00:14:54.549
Also there were several from the country committee of Romania.

00:14:54.549 --> 00:15:02.960
I remember the first night there was a lot of accusations about what the others had done and not done,

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:08.960
which did not create the best spirit. And we mainly listened.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:19.269
But everybody agreed to meet another night. And the second night obviously Jehovah wanted the brothers to unite again.

00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:27.269
And the whole spirit was different and the brothers talked the matters over and clarified some misunderstandings.

00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:34.269
And at the end of the second evening I remember the leader of the separate group brother Albu said,

00:15:34.269 --> 00:15:43.350
let's do it because if we don't do it now, we may never have another opportunity again.

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:50.080
And so the decision was made. It doesn't happen every day.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:57.960
There are 5,000 brothers come back to the organization.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:04.960
From then on all the practical things were put in place to accomplish this reunification.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:12.960
They were asked to marriage with our congregations. And it also took a lot of humility on their part.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:24.960
But they were willing to do it. So they were really brothers in their heart and loved the truth.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:35.340
And so the reunification was accomplished. And it was a wonderful victory for Jehovah and against Satan.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:45.340
Reflecting on the experience with the brothers in Romania we can see there could always be misunderstandings among humans.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:54.340
And there could always be even legitimate complaints about misconduct of some responsible brothers.

00:16:54.340 --> 00:17:01.340
But the important thing is never to lose trust that this is Jehovah's organization.

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:06.339
That's where Jehovah's blessing is. Jehovah sees it all.

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:11.339
Jehovah uses his Holy Spirit to keep the organization together.

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:15.339
And what he wants to have accomplished will happen.

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:28.460
And if we work with the Holy Spirit then Jehovah will bless our efforts and it will be successful to his praise.

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:33.460
Of course these challenges were not unique to the brothers in Romania.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:43.460
Similar challenges occurred in other countries that were behind the iron curtain including Czechoslovakia, Russia and Ukraine.

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:49.700
So what have we learned in this update?

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:53.700
Jehovah's organization is on the move.

00:17:53.700 --> 00:18:04.700
Even during this pandemic we see strong evidence that Jehovah's spirit is blessing and moving ahead the preaching and disciples making work.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:13.700
Despite many challenges, you dear brothers and sisters are working hard to maintain our precious unity.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:21.700
As a result we are enjoying a spiritual paradise as we work unitingly together.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:28.700
Satan will continue to try to stir up division even among Jehovah's people.

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:33.700
What can we do to successfully resist his efforts?

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:40.700
Listen to the channel that Jehovah is using, the faithful and discreet slave.

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:48.700
Don't allow yourself to become emotionally involved with the causes of this world, whatever they may be.

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:58.700
There is no doubt that Jehovah will reach to bless all those who support our King Jesus Christ and the channel that he is using today.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:03.299
The faithful and discreet slave.

00:19:03.299 --> 00:19:10.299
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses this is J.W. Broadcasting.
