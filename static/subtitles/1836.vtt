00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:06.459
I wanted to help the deaf so that they too can know Jehovah.

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:10.460
So I decided to move to a sign language territory,

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.460
the sign language group in Dar es Alam.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.899
We had to travel by bus and sometimes we traveled far,

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:22.899
stuck in a traffic jam for two to three hours and it was expensive.

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:29.500
I still remember my early days in service with the sign language group.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.500
I was very inexperienced with the language and one day

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.500
my service partner asked me to conduct a Bible study.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.500
Every time I tried to talk to the student,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.500
she didn't understand.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.500
As I kept trying, she became more and more frustrated with me

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.500
and I started to feel discouraged.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.500
I wanted to help but I was powerless.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:00.320
I felt bad, I told myself, I still don't know the deaf.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.320
I still don't know sign language.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.319
Why has Jehovah brought me into this field in which I'm not able to help the deaf?

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:18.069
I was invited to the school for Kingdom Evangelizers in 2014 from September to November.

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:23.069
After graduating, I received an assignment in sign language again.

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:26.069
Jehovah truly helped me so much.

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:31.069
That was exactly the encouragement I needed to persevere in learning the language

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:35.069
and becoming more effective in my assignment.

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:41.069
I was able to conduct my own Bible studies and they could really understand me now.

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:46.069
When we started, there were two baptized deaf publishers but now they are over 10.

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:51.069
I have had the opportunity to help three deaf people to make progress,

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:55.069
to dedicate themselves to Jehovah and get baptized.

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:00.069
The training I received at the school is still helping me now in my new assignment

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:04.069
at the Translation Office where I self-together with my husband.

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:07.069
We are joyful because we know that through this work,

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.069
many deaf people will receive publications in their language

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.069
and this will bring about an increase in this territory.

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:22.889
I graduated from the school for Kingdom Evangelizers in 2015

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:26.889
and it was a privilege to receive the assignment to call help the Messiah

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:29.889
to know Jehovah in their mother tongue.

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:34.889
Traveling is difficult.

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:40.889
Sometimes I travel by vehicle but sometimes there are areas in which there are no vehicles

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:43.889
so I'm forced to walk.

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:49.889
Sometimes I can travel by motorcycle to reach many more people

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:53.889
but still transportation is a difficult part of it.

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:59.889
There are valleys, there are mountains, there are uphills, there are downhills.

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.889
So transportation is difficult.

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:08.889
When I finally reached the territory, I was able to find the Messiah.

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:13.889
I was apprehensive about their reaction because I know their culture.

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:20.889
They don't know Jehovah, so I wondered what would happen when I reached their territory.

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:24.889
During that stressful time, I prayed to Jehovah,

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.889
I read his word the Bible,

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:33.889
I meditated on accounts of our brothers and sisters mentioned in the Bible

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:37.889
and after prayer, Jehovah gave me strength.

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:42.889
I was able to return to them, make return visits and start Bible studies

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.889
so the results have been good.

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:49.889
I am happy that after starting studies,

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:53.889
some started taking steps and attending meetings.

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:58.889
They later made good progress and now some of them are our brothers and sisters.

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:03.889
They dedicated themselves and were baptized.

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:05.889
I feel so much joy.

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:09.889
Jehovah has given me the strength, the ability to be used,

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:14.889
to further the preaching of the good news and to help the Messiah spiritually.
