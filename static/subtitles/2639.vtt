00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:13.449
Animated videos, like those in this series become Jehovah's Friend, have been helping young ones

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:17.649
draw closer to their Heavenly Father for several years now.

00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:20.149
Look, Mom. I'm rejoicing in the hope.

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:25.920
Wee!

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.420
But did you know?

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.920
What you see on the screen might last just a few short minutes.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.159
But it may involve weeks of work,

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:42.159
by a virtual army of volunteers.

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:46.659
With so much time and expense involved in making an animated video,

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:50.159
a lot of careful planning is required to avoid waste

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:53.659
and keep the process running smoothly.

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:58.159
Let's take a look at how effective use of pre-production tools

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.159
help all these brothers and sisters work together

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:06.659
to take a video from initial concept to a final production.

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.159
Under the direction of the teaching committee of the governing body,

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.159
the work begins long before the artist even gets started.

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.659
They provide the direction on the theme that needs to be taught.

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.659
Members of the animation team collaborate to develop the featured characters

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.659
as well as plot structure.

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.659
And we're closely with writers and storyboard artists

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.659
to develop the approved idea into a storyline.

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.159
Once a complete script is ready, the whole team gathers together for a table read.

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.159
This is the first time the team hears the whole script being read aloud.

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.159
Dialogs meant to be heard.

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.659
So when we read it aloud at the table read,

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.659
we pick up on things we didn't see in the written script.

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.159
We're able to tighten the story and make it as clear as possible.

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.159
The script is reviewed by the research team for accuracy.

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.659
Then it's revised, polished, and submitted to the teaching committee for approval.

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.659
With an approved script in hand, the director then works with an artist

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:15.159
to start turning words into pictures,

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.159
visualizing each scene on a storyboard.

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:23.159
First come the rough boards, showing what will be included in each shot.

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.159
When it comes to the animation world,

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:30.159
everything you see on screen has to be designed and created.

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:37.159
From the characters, furniture, the props, the environment are all created by a designer.

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:41.159
The storyboard really helps us figure out what exactly we need to create

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:46.210
so that we're not creating too much or too little.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:53.210
Once approved by the director, the storyboard artist cleans up each of the boards.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.210
Preliminary recordings of dialogue, music,

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.210
and sound effects are added.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:07.210
These are then used by the director and compositor to create an animatic.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.210
An animatic is a rough draft of the entire video.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.210
The animatic is very important for us.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.210
Now with the director and more importantly the teaching committee,

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.210
they can see the entire video before actually making it.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.210
And with that they can review it and give us a proper direction.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.210
The finished animatic is submitted to the teaching committee for review.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.210
Based on direction from the committee,

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.210
the team makes sure that the teaching points come across clearly

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.210
and that the finished product is true to the spirit

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.210
and intent of the approved concept for the video.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:50.210
Finally, using the approved animatic as a blueprint,

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.210
full production begins.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.280
Really everything in animation can be very time consuming.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.280
An animator working full time here at Bethel

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.280
may be able to produce four to six seconds of animation in one week.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.280
And that doesn't even include other aspects that are very important,

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.279
such as modeling, rigging, lighting, compositing, and many others.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.279
From the examples shown here,

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:25.279
you can see just how closely the final version of the video

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:31.480
make Jehovah happy follows the animatic.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.480
Pre-production tools, such as storyboards and animatics,

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.480
do more than save the organization time and money.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.480
They enable the teaching committee to carefully evaluate

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.480
every project along the way.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.480
From the initial approved concept to the final product,

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:56.480
in order to keep providing videos that help all of us honor our friend, Jehovah.
