00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:08.339
There are many beautiful lessons that we can learn from this account of Lazarus Resurrection.

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:15.019
And one aspect that we're going to discuss today is it reminds us to trust in Jehovah,

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:22.059
to not waver in our faith, even if things do not unfold the way we think they should.

00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:25.980
You may remember a few weeks back at our midweek meeting, one of the references was

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.059
the August 2017 watchtower.

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:35.659
And I talked about how the peace of God is more wonderful than can be imagined.

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:36.659
And it said this.

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:42.700
It says, so although from a human viewpoint, we may not see away out of our problems,

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.539
Jehovah does, and he can do the unexpected.

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.100
Jehovah does, and he can do the unexpected.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.939
That means Jehovah can make things turn out even better than we can imagine.

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:59.539
Do you believe this?

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:06.180
Well, those were the words of Jesus to Martha, if we look into account in John chapter 11

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.260
of verse 26.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.379
He had just explained that those who exercise faith in him, though they die, will come

00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:14.379
to life.

00:01:14.379 --> 00:01:19.900
And he said there, at the end of verse 26, it's recorded, do you believe this?

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.659
Now Lazarus had been sick to the point of dying.

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:30.000
And Martha and Mary felt that the only solution they could see was for Jesus to come and heal

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.500
their brother.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.939
You look at chapter 11 of verse 3.

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.700
So his sister sent a message to him saying, Lord, see, the one you have affection for

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.099
is sick.

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:42.379
They wanted Jesus to come and heal him.

00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:43.859
They had seen him heal people.

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:47.859
They knew if he was just there, everything would work out okay.

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:52.340
In fact, it's of note that both of them said exactly the same thing on two different

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.260
occasions to Jesus when they first met him.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.379
Look at in verse 21.

00:01:56.379 --> 00:02:03.180
It says, Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.900
Verse 32, later Mary arrived.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.180
She falls at his feet and says, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.780
That was the solution they felt to their problem, to this situation.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.500
Well now Lazarus died.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.500
So now what?

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.500
Well now Martha, it appears, is trying to gain comfort from the only other solution that

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.180
she can see.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.580
Look at verses 23 and 24.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.099
Jesus said to her, your brother will rise.

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:40.419
Martha said to him, I know he will rise in the resurrection on the last day.

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:41.419
That's interesting.

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:43.500
Jesus says, Martha, your brother will rise.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.300
And she immediately jumps to the only solution that she can see.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.180
I know he will rise on the last day.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.020
Now she obviously wished for much more.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.699
You look at verse 22, she says, yet even now, I know that whatever you ask God for, God

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:59.699
will give you.

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:00.699
She wanted more.

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:05.740
Jesus said, your brother is going to rise and she says, I know he will rise on the last

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.340
day.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.659
Why didn't she say, I know Jesus, I know you can resurrect him right now if you want

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:14.460
to, or please Lord, please resurrect him.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.379
She know about new of the two previous resurrections that Jesus had performed.

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:26.020
Know how she was also well aware of the resurrection that Elijah and Elijah performed.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.219
Perhaps she even knew about the one where the dead man had been, they threw the dead man

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:34.860
and he touched Elijah's bones and came to life.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:41.740
So why didn't she express confidence that Jesus would resurrect him right then?

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.860
We don't know for sure, but there are at least two things that were unique about Lazarus

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.939
death in his situation that may have caused her to see only one solution to her pain.

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:54.419
What was that?

00:03:54.419 --> 00:04:00.740
Well, one is that all the other previous recorded resurrections by Jesus and the ones by both

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.659
Elijah and Elijah were of young people.

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:11.180
In 1st Kings chapter 17, it tells of Elijah resurrecting the widow's son.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.780
The account tells us that Elijah carried the boy to the roof chamber.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.300
He asked God to bring back the child's life.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:25.180
In 2nd Kings chapter 4, Elijah resurrects the son of the couple who had provided him

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.740
with that apartment.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.259
And while verse 18 does say that the child grew up, the account though says that the attendant

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:38.939
carried the boy back to his mother and he sat on her lap until noon, until he died,

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:43.180
and the account refers to him as the boy and the child.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.819
The accounts indicate that Jesus called the son of the widow of name a young man and

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:52.819
Jarrah's daughter a child.

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:58.540
So all four of the previous known resurrections were likely of young people.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.339
All indications were that Lazarus was a grown man.

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:07.019
Now the second thing though, that was even more unique about Lazarus' situation than

00:05:07.019 --> 00:05:12.980
the other resurrections, may be indicated by Martha's bit of a panic by which she says

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.740
as recorded in chapter 11 and verse 39.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.139
Jesus said, take the stone away.

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:23.259
Martha, the sister of the deceased, said to him, Lord, by now he must smell for it

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:26.259
has been four days.

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.779
Lazarus had been dead for four days.

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:33.180
And all other situations, including the one where the man came to life when he touched

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:38.819
Elijah's bones, the person that either just died or were on their way to being buried.

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:43.660
Well here, now Lazarus had died, been prepared for burial, been in the tomb for four days,

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.139
had begun to decay.

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:51.860
So thus we can hear the bit of a panic in Martha's voice as she reminds Jesus how long

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.980
Lazarus has been dead.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:54.980
What does Jesus say?

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.220
Well you look at verse 40.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:04.019
Jesus said to her, did I not tell you that if you would believe, you would see the glory

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:05.620
of God?

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:12.019
See if she just believed and trusted, she would see a solution that she could not even

00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:13.019
hope for.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:19.019
See if she just believed, things would turn out even better than she could imagine.

00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:20.620
And that's exactly what happened.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.100
Jesus resurrected Lazarus, called him out and he came not only restored to life, but

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.259
his skin restored from decay.

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:32.300
Do you believe this?

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:38.139
Now there's many accounts in the Bible where the outcome turned out very different than

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:41.620
the servants of Jehovah could have possibly imagined.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.500
For example, can you imagine that as they were throwing Jonah off the boat?

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.459
Could he, can you, can you picture him imagining how things would work out?

00:06:50.459 --> 00:06:55.379
Oh, I bet a fish will come and swallow me and then I'll live and I'll go, no, he thought

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:56.699
he was a dead man.

00:06:56.699 --> 00:06:59.579
He could, not in a million years, could he have imagined that outcome?

00:06:59.579 --> 00:07:02.180
Or what about Gideon and his 300 men?

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.699
As they're lining up around the Midianites and what appears to be by all accounts of suicide

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:11.819
mission, do you think they could have imagined how things would have turned out?

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:13.819
Well, what about Peter?

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:20.019
He's in prison chained between two soldiers surrounded by other soldiers likely to be executed

00:07:20.019 --> 00:07:21.259
in the morning.

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:25.980
Can you think, do you think he could have imagined walking out of prison in the miraculous

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:26.980
way that he did?

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.259
No, he thought he was a dead man.

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:30.540
What's the point for us?

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:34.540
Well, look at the illustrations on the monitor.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.980
As you look at these, what feelings do you have?

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:46.939
What are you 100% confident of and what is it that you only dare to hope for?

00:07:46.939 --> 00:07:51.819
Now we are 100% confident that Jehovah is going to deliver his people.

00:07:51.819 --> 00:07:53.699
We have no doubt of that.

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:58.300
We know Jehovah is going to be victorious.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:02.579
But where may your faith start to waver?

00:08:02.579 --> 00:08:05.579
Will we may wonder how?

00:08:05.579 --> 00:08:08.180
How will this affect me personally?

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.939
How will it affect my family?

00:08:09.939 --> 00:08:14.939
Will I make it through or will I be killed in all of this and have to wait for a resurrected?

00:08:14.939 --> 00:08:17.339
What if I'm separated from my family?

00:08:17.339 --> 00:08:19.339
What will happen?

00:08:19.339 --> 00:08:20.660
What does the Bible say?

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.740
Well, look at 2 Peter, chapter 2 and verse 9.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:29.500
And just a beautiful verse that reminds us to trust in Jehovah.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:36.460
The second Peter, 2 and verse 9, the first part of this is, so then, Jehovah knows how

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:41.860
to deliver or how to rescue people of Godly devotion out of trial.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:42.860
This is in the context.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:48.779
And when it talked about how Jehovah delivered Noah, how Jehovah delivered a lot, Jehovah

00:08:48.779 --> 00:08:51.860
says, listen, I know what to do.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:59.139
I know how to rescue people out of Godly, out of tribulation, people of Godly devotion.

00:08:59.139 --> 00:09:04.460
Do you believe this?

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:09.460
So what lesson do we learn of the account of Martha, Mary, and Lazarus' resurrection?

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:14.460
Well, the reminder for today is, trust in Jehovah.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.940
Do not waver in your faith.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:22.460
Even if things do not unfold, the way we think they should or the way we imagine.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:28.500
Don't waste time trying to think through scenarios that may or may not play out.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:35.299
As Jehovah told King Jehasaphat and Fafo Judah's record as 2 Chronicles 20 verse 17, may we

00:09:35.299 --> 00:09:36.299
do the same thing?

00:09:36.299 --> 00:09:43.259
May we stand still and see the salvation of Jehovah with full assurance that things will

00:09:43.259 --> 00:09:46.179
turn out even better than we could imagine.
