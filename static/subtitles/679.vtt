00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:09.339
On Sunday, February the 26th, I traveled to Port-Aprince for the branch visit that was

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:15.220
warmly welcomed by many of the Bethel family of 54 members.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:21.140
The branch office supervises the preaching work for more than 20,000 publishers.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.579
Although Haiti has faced economic challenges and suffered recent natural disasters, our

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:31.379
brothers are positive and focus their attention on helping others to identify our

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:37.340
scriptural hope. The Haitian people show a keen interest in the word of God. Our

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.020
brothers averaged more than 42,000 Bible studies each month and Haiti enjoyed a

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.899
memorial attendance of more than 86,000 in 2016. This is four times more than the

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.700
number of publishers in the branch territory. The brothers love to use the

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.619
videos in the ministry. This is made possible by the Haiti audio video teams

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:04.379
translating the videos into their native language. While many in Haiti speak

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.859
French, the common language of the people in general is Haitian Creole. Creole is

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:15.459
said to be an expressive language that combines French words with the grammar of

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:21.299
West African languages. The number of publishers in Haiti has quadrupled since

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.260
a start of Creole translation back in 1987. The complete New World

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:32.780
translation Bible was released in Creole in 2015. We met with the translation

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.140
team to commend them for the good work they do. We reminded them of the many

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.180
positive results in the field ministry that have taken place since translating

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.180
the Bible and our literature in Creole. As an example, Merlene is a vendor of

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.379
fruits and vegetables who was asked if she would supply some of her produce to

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:55.379
Bethel. Although she was very impressed the first time she arrived at the

00:01:55.379 --> 00:02:01.739
Bethel property, she said she found the large steel gate to be intimidating. So

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:06.459
she prayed to God to protect her while in the yard at Bethel. The brothers

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:10.539
dealt kindly with her when she made her deliveries on Monday each week. One of

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.620
the brothers from the kitchen told her that maybe someday she too would become one

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.500
of Jehovah's Witnesses. She accepted an invitation to the memorial and despite

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.900
some personal challenges such as not being able to read well, she began to attend

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.300
some congregation meetings. Merlene could see the difference between Jehovah's

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.139
loving people and those in her church. A study was started with her and she

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:38.259
progressed to the point of baptism in 2009. Since then, she has worked

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:43.460
diligently to teach the truth to her children with good results. Her oldest son

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.659
graduated from the School for Kingdom Evangelizers and serves as an elder in

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:53.979
temporary special pioneer. Recently, another for sons was appointed

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:59.539
ministerial servant and the four other children are unbaptized publishers.

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:04.020
Having our literature in Creole and with the help of her children, she has

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.379
improved her reading. She now benefits from reading the Bible in Creole, the

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:15.500
language of her heart. Good results are beginning to be seen in the field of

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.099
American Sign Language, which is now used in Haiti. There are now 87 deaf

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:27.460
publishers and four ASL congregations and eight groups. The congregation here

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:33.180
is singing praises to Jehovah. Even our little sisters learning to do this.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:40.830
This brother showed us the effort he puts forth to prepare for a Bible reading.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.860
A special program for Haiti was held on Saturday morning at the Open Air

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.900
Assembly Hall on the Branch Property. A total of 1,405 were in attendance. We

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.259
were very encouraged to see the group of our brothers who benefited from the

00:03:57.259 --> 00:04:02.979
program in American Sign Language. The program was recorded and presented at

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:07.740
Kingdom Halls throughout the country later that same day and also in Sunday to

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.860
combined audience of 34,812. We felt a little sad to leave the

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.699
brothers on Sunday morning for a drive of about six hours or so to the

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:24.579
Dominican Republic where the second branch visit. In route we traveled

00:04:24.579 --> 00:04:29.339
through some semi-arid areas to the border between the two countries. The

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:33.899
terrain varied greatly as we drove through small mountains, rich agricultural

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:39.779
regions, and along the Caribbean Sea. We took the opportunity to witness to some

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:44.379
individuals at the border and at various checkpoints leaving literature along

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:51.110
the way. Upon entering the city of Santo Domingo, we quickly identified the

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.990
large JW.org sign at the branch office. We were enthusiastically greeted by

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:03.110
many of the 73 Bethel family members. Although the preaching work is done

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.709
primarily in Spanish, our brothers are expanding their ministry to reach the

00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:12.350
language of the hearts of many peoples and cultures. There are now five Haitian

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.350
Creole circuits in the branch territory, 26 American Sign Language

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.910
congregations, and other congregations or groups in Russian, Chinese, Italian,

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.470
and French. We joined a group of brothers and sisters in the field ministry in

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:32.149
the Chinatown District of Santo Domingo. Our group gave a witness to both Spanish

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:37.550
and Chinese-speaking people on the streets, most of whom respectfully listened to

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:44.389
our message. A Bethel brother, Evan, told us of the challenge he faced when

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:49.709
learning the truth. I was finishing medical school while serving in the

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:56.149
Dominican Army. By then, I had been serving for six years. At my aunt's home, I

00:05:56.149 --> 00:06:03.040
found the revelation book. It made such an impact on me that I stole it.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:10.160
And read it all on my own. There's a vision in Chapter 6 of Revelation where

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.199
the sixth seals open and the skies darken and the army commanders hide in caves.

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:22.360
That vision impressed me so much that I decided to serve Jehovah. That meant

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:28.399
that I would have to leave the army because witnesses are neutral. I quickly

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:32.680
decided to talk to my immediate commander to ask him to please discharge me

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.959
from the army. However, he rejected my request and said,

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:44.199
no, you have served in the army for six years. You have to stay in the army. I was

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:47.800
not concerned because I could still appeal to the colonel and charge of personnel.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.000
However, my request for resignation was rejected again. I left and went to the

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.240
hallway. I prayed to Jehovah. I want to serve you. What should I do? Help me

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.839
find a way out of this. When I opened my eyes, another army officer approached

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:07.879
and greeted me using my name. I still don't know who he is. He asked me,

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:12.800
what do you need? I explained that I wanted to resign in order to become a

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.879
Jehovah's Witness. He said, don't worry, give me your papers. I'm the colonel's

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:23.800
assistant. Within 20 minutes, my discharge papers were ready and approved. In a

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.800
short period of time, I became a publisher and I got baptized as one of Jehovah's

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.279
Witnesses. At this time, I've been serving happily and Bethel for over 11 years

00:07:32.279 --> 00:07:40.339
with my wife, Hyell. Without a doubt, Jehovah helps those who put their

00:07:40.339 --> 00:07:44.699
complete trust in him. The branch is blessed to have as part of their Bethel

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:50.139
family, some who had been longtime missionaries. I enjoyed a very pleasant

00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:55.420
visit with five of the senior members of this group, three of whom are 98

00:07:55.420 --> 00:08:00.939
years of age. Brother William Dingman is at the first class of Gillian. His wife

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:07.220
Estelle attended the 12th class. Thelma Crites is also the 12th class. Barbara

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:12.220
Parker's of the 42nd class. And Helen Ferrari attended the 2nd class of

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:17.300
Gillian. To illustrate the length of their full-time service is the fact that

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:22.139
Sister Ferrari is among those who stood up to identify themselves as part of the

00:08:22.139 --> 00:08:29.139
great multitude at the 1935 convention in Washington DC. The average age of

00:08:29.139 --> 00:08:35.700
this group is 94. Even more impressive is that their average years of full-time

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:41.500
service is 73. These faithful ones set a fine example continuing to be active in

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:46.659
the ministry, taking into account their ages and health limitations. Such

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:50.860
loyal servants of Jehovah are considered spiritual treasures wherever they

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:56.980
serve. I still have one study so far, although my sight doesn't allow me to do too

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:07.059
much, but I try. My legs aren't so good for walking, so I will be around. In all of

00:09:07.059 --> 00:09:14.379
my life I would consider the life that I have spent as a missionary and in

00:09:14.379 --> 00:09:23.379
Dominican Republic as well. It's a wonderful life. I couldn't have chosen

00:09:23.379 --> 00:09:32.419
Barbara Companion, and also a better life than to be preaching the message of

00:09:32.419 --> 00:09:36.820
the good news of the kingdom. The Dominican Republic Bethel family considers

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:43.220
it a privilege to have a share in providing care for such faithful ones. On Sunday

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:48.340
March the 12th, a special program was held at the open air assembly hall adjacent

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:53.179
to the branch office. A total of three thousand and fifty benefited from the

00:09:53.179 --> 00:09:58.500
spiritual program in Christian association. The visits to the Dominican Republic

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.779
and Haiti branches proved to be an encouragement and a spiritual blessing to

00:10:02.779 --> 00:10:06.179
all who participated in them.
