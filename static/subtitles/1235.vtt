00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.150
Uh, you're up early today.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.150
Dad?

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.150
Yeah.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.150
I want to get baptized.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.149
Okay, let's talk about it.

00:00:17.149 --> 00:00:22.149
I was thinking, you know, mom was baptized and she was 12 and, you know, I'm...

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:24.149
Now you're 12, is that it?

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:28.149
I know what you're thinking, Dad, but I'm ready. I know I am.

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:33.149
I'll tell you what. Let's do a special family study series first, okay?

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.149
On what?

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.149
Well, we'll start with faith.

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:47.460
Being dedicated to Jehovah and staying dedicated to Him, it requires that we have strong faith.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:58.829
By faith, Noah, after receiving divine warnings of things not yet seen, showed godly fear and constructed in art.

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.829
Abraham just as good as offered up Isaac, so how did that take a lot of faith?

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:10.829
So the Bible says that Abel was faithful his whole life, but he was also faithful until Dad.

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:12.829
So what do you think that means?

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:42.900
Rachel, keep your faith strong and you will never fail.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.900
Love, Dad.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:02:21.330
How do you like the pictures?

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.830
Do you like this one or less?

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.080
Oh, your mom would have really liked this one.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.080
I used to wish she could have been there today.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.080
I know. Me too.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:40.080
Which is why I've been thinking if she were here, I think she would have wanted you to have this.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.080
Mom's memory book.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.080
I thought you could pick up where she left off.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.080
And fill it with your fee-cratic memories.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.080
And then one day soon we can share those memories with her in the new world.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.080
What do you say?

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.080
Yeah, I would love that.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.080
Yeah, good.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.080
Thanks, Dad.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.080
You're welcome.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:08.550
Hey, Rachel.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.550
I was just looking at some old pictures of you.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.900
Long time ago.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.900
Yeah, it was.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.900
Is there any mail for me?

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.900
Yeah, it's right here on the counter.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:30.340
Oh, an invitation.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.340
How was your day?

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.340
How was the museum?

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.340
I was okay.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.419
Something bothering you.

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:50.139
But like all my friends are getting married.

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.139
People at work wonder why I'm not dating.

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:55.139
And they even tried to set me up.

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.139
I mean, come on.

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.139
Aren't you interested in, you know, being with a girl?

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:03.810
I met someone at the museum today.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.810
He was really nice.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.810
I'm finally getting the attention I want.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.810
But it's not from a witness.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:12.810
Just call me, okay?

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.810
He'll be fine.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.810
So what are you going to do about it?

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:35.579
Rachel, always remember.

00:04:35.579 --> 00:04:38.579
Virtue is a beautiful quality.

00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:42.579
It's not just passive avoidance, but has real power.

00:04:42.579 --> 00:04:45.579
Power to do good.

00:04:45.579 --> 00:04:49.579
Treasure virtue and Jehovah will treasure you.

00:04:49.579 --> 00:04:56.139
Love, dad.

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.139
Virtue is based on our love for Jehovah.

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.139
As it says in the book of Psalms,

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.139
O lovers of Jehovah, hate what is bad.

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:11.779
Just call me, okay?

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:13.779
It'll be fun.

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:29.910
Do I love Jehovah enough to hate what is bad?

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:30.910
Give me a mail for me today?

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.910
No, not today.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.910
The printing company called, though, I picked up this package for you.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.910
The invitations arrived.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.910
Eventually, I ended up getting engaged to a wonderful brother.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:50.910
But even so, I realized that marriage wasn't the solution to my problem.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.910
Remaining faithful to Jehovah is what really made me happy.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.230
Mom, do we have anything to eat?

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.230
I can't believe you're so hungry.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.230
He is a growing boy.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.230
What are you going to do with all that energy, son?

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.230
I'm trying to study.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:20.230
For school?

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:21.230
No, it's for the meeting tomorrow.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.230
I want to be able to give a comment.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.230
That's good.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.230
I'm sensing there's a problem, though.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.230
Yeah, a big one.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.230
I don't like to study.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.230
It's so boring.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.230
You know, I used to find it hard to study, too.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.230
And then I realized study can be like exercise.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.230
It may not seem enjoyable at first.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:45.230
But once you make the effort and then establish a regular routine,

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.230
it becomes enjoyable, even fun.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:52.230
And soon, it won't feel like work anymore.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:53.230
I agree.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:59.230
I tell you what, we can go up to your room and I'll show you how to get the most out of your study.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:09.269
Okay, sounds good.

00:07:09.269 --> 00:07:12.269
Dad reminded me to pray to Jehovah first,

00:07:12.269 --> 00:07:15.269
asking for help to understand what I'm studying.

00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:18.269
He said it's important to look up the scriptures

00:07:18.269 --> 00:07:24.269
and make sure I review the main points, then think about how the material applies to me.

00:07:24.269 --> 00:07:28.269
I learned that study isn't just preparing for meetings.

00:07:28.269 --> 00:07:32.269
It's learning about Jehovah and how to live a good life.

00:07:32.269 --> 00:07:34.269
And it doesn't always mean reading.

00:07:34.269 --> 00:07:37.269
Sometimes, I can even look at creation

00:07:37.269 --> 00:07:41.269
or draw pictures about something I learned.

00:07:41.269 --> 00:07:45.269
After a few weeks, I really started to enjoy it

00:07:45.269 --> 00:07:47.269
and my study time flew by.

00:07:47.269 --> 00:07:58.009
There's no one.

00:07:58.009 --> 00:08:00.009
He's having his room studying.

00:08:00.009 --> 00:08:08.750
Studying?

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.750
Oh man, Grandpa and Dad are right.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.750
About what?

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.750
Well, is it the studying one feel like work anymore?

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.750
I remember when Grandpa said the same thing to me.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.750
I breathed this for you.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:25.750
He gave this to me when I was about your age.

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.750
Rachel, apply yourself to study

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.750
and soon it won't feel like work.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:43.029
Love, Dad.

00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:44.029
Hey, Ma.

00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:45.029
Morning, Noah.

00:08:45.029 --> 00:08:46.029
You going on a service?

00:08:46.029 --> 00:08:48.029
No, I actually have some things I need to get done

00:08:48.029 --> 00:08:51.029
and then I was hoping to do some painting or sketching later.

00:08:51.029 --> 00:08:52.029
No, please.

00:08:52.029 --> 00:08:54.029
You must be ahead on your schedule.

00:08:54.029 --> 00:08:55.029
You ready, son?

00:08:55.029 --> 00:08:56.029
Ready.

00:08:56.029 --> 00:08:58.029
Thanks for lunch.

00:08:58.029 --> 00:08:59.029
Have a good day.

00:08:59.029 --> 00:09:00.029
Bye, Mom.

00:09:00.029 --> 00:09:01.029
Love you.

00:09:01.029 --> 00:09:03.029
I've been planning this day off for months now.

00:09:03.029 --> 00:09:06.029
I really want a chance to relax and paint.

00:09:06.029 --> 00:09:10.029
I hardly ever get to take some time off.

00:09:10.029 --> 00:09:12.029
Nothing's going to get in the way.

00:09:12.029 --> 00:09:17.960
Hey, Rach.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.960
How are you?

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.960
Good, how are you?

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:20.960
Good.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.960
Well, I'm on the way to the Hall for Service

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.960
and I was wondering if later today, maybe if you had some time,

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.960
I started a new study with this young girl.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.960
Nice.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.960
Actually, you know, I already have plans for the day.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.960
What about Sarah?

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.960
I check.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:35.960
She has plans.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.960
Daisy?

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.960
No.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:38.960
Simone.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:39.960
No.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.960
That's okay.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:41.960
I'll find somebody.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.960
Thanks so much for understanding Anne.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.960
I felt bad, but she didn't seem to mind.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.960
Like she said, I'm sure she'll find someone.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:10:03.220
Memory book.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.220
I haven't seen this in a while.

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:17.940
Dad's cards always gave me such good advice.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:22.940
Rachel, self-control is more than just refraining from doing bad.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:26.940
It compels us to do good, like kingdom preaching.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:31.940
Don't let the unwilling flesh extinguish the fire of a willing spirit.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:36.429
Love, dad.

00:10:36.429 --> 00:10:38.429
Self-control.

00:10:38.429 --> 00:10:41.429
I never thought of it that way before.

00:10:41.429 --> 00:10:44.429
There's nothing wrong with taking a day off.

00:10:44.429 --> 00:10:47.429
But Anne does need help.

00:10:47.429 --> 00:10:51.429
And I'll still have time to paint when I get back.

00:10:51.429 --> 00:10:53.429
Change of plans, Rachel.

00:10:53.429 --> 00:11:00.519
Anne, this is Rachel.

00:11:00.519 --> 00:11:04.519
Did you find anybody to go on the Bible study with you?

00:11:04.519 --> 00:11:06.519
Could I go with you?

00:11:06.519 --> 00:11:08.519
Perfect. Where can I meet you?

00:11:08.519 --> 00:11:17.909
See you soon.

00:11:17.909 --> 00:11:20.909
I'm glad I decided to help Anne.

00:11:20.909 --> 00:11:24.909
That was such a good Bible study.

00:11:24.909 --> 00:11:27.909
And I still have time to paint.

00:11:27.909 --> 00:11:30.909
This turned out to be a great day.

00:11:30.909 --> 00:11:36.980
So how was Pioneer School?

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:37.980
It was great.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.980
We had Brother Daniels as our primary instructor.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:41.980
He's incredible.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:43.980
He's a good teacher.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.980
And Noah, what was it like to be in Pioneer School with your grandpa?

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.980
It was great. It really was.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:49.980
Hard to believe, though.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.980
I never thought this system would last so long.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.980
And I certainly never thought I'd be a grandfather.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.980
So grandpa, what was it like when you were my age?

00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:59.980
Well, when I was about your age,

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.980
I had just become a new father.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:08.659
I could tell even then your mother was going to be an artist.

00:12:08.659 --> 00:12:12.659
Those were good times for us.

00:12:12.659 --> 00:12:14.659
A few years later, though,

00:12:14.659 --> 00:12:19.419
your grandmother became seriously ill.

00:12:19.419 --> 00:12:22.669
We didn't know it at the time,

00:12:22.669 --> 00:12:25.669
but she wasn't going to get better.

00:12:25.669 --> 00:12:32.179
Watching your best friend die a little each day.

00:12:32.179 --> 00:12:34.179
It just tears you up inside.

00:12:34.179 --> 00:12:56.700
With Jehovah's help,

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:00.700
and with the support of the brothers and sisters,

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:04.740
we got through it.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:09.740
We learned to rely on Jehovah in ways we never had before.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.740
And that helped when years later,

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:15.740
another test came our way.

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.740
You see, back then,

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.740
some were looking to a certain date

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:23.740
as signifying the end of this old system of things.

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:27.740
A few even went so far as selling their homes,

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.740
including their jobs.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:33.740
I admit I was ready to see this old system go away too,

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.740
but something just didn't seem right.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:38.740
Both at meetings,

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.740
and in my personal study,

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.740
I was reminded of what Jesus said.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:47.740
Nobody knows the day or hour.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:51.740
I was dedicated to Jehovah, not a date.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:55.990
After that year came and went,

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:57.990
most of those who had wrong expectations

00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:59.990
made the needed adjustments,

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:01.990
and they stayed.

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:05.299
We didn't run away,

00:14:05.299 --> 00:14:07.299
and we didn't give up.

00:14:07.299 --> 00:14:12.289
We trusted in Jehovah.

00:14:12.289 --> 00:14:14.289
When I see older ones now,

00:14:14.289 --> 00:14:16.289
I don't just see gray hair.

00:14:16.289 --> 00:14:20.289
I see living, breathing examples of endurance.

00:14:20.289 --> 00:14:21.289
Wow, Grandpa.

00:14:21.289 --> 00:14:23.289
I didn't know you had to endure through all that.

00:14:23.289 --> 00:14:26.289
We got through it with Jehovah's help.

00:14:26.289 --> 00:14:29.289
But Scott, you were in Pioneer School recently, right?

00:14:29.289 --> 00:14:38.549
Yeah, just a year ago.

00:14:38.549 --> 00:14:41.549
But Scott, you were in Pioneer School recently, right?

00:14:41.549 --> 00:14:47.480
Yeah, just a year ago.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:53.580
I didn't know that evening

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:56.580
would be one of our last together.

00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:05.549
If I had known,

00:15:05.549 --> 00:15:07.549
I would have thanked that

00:15:07.549 --> 00:15:09.549
for all that he did,

00:15:09.549 --> 00:15:19.330
teaching me how to study,

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:23.980
meditate,

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:29.759
and put into practice beautiful qualities.

00:15:29.759 --> 00:15:37.100
A gift he shared,

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.100
not just with me,

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:50.799
a gift in Scripture or reminders

00:15:50.799 --> 00:15:53.799
that somehow seemed to keep giving,

00:15:53.799 --> 00:15:59.700
no matter how hard it got.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:08.620
The Bible training he gave me

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:10.620
never steered me wrong.

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:16.139
No idea the impact it would have on me.

00:16:16.139 --> 00:16:22.940
But he did,

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:23.940
I think, Jehovah,

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:25.940
that he raised me in the truth

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.940
the way he did.

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:41.649
Rachel,

00:16:41.649 --> 00:16:43.649
as a parent,

00:16:43.649 --> 00:16:44.649
you pray

00:16:44.649 --> 00:16:46.649
that your child always stays

00:16:46.649 --> 00:16:48.649
close to Jehovah.

00:16:48.649 --> 00:16:50.649
So I made it my goal

00:16:50.649 --> 00:16:52.649
to instill the qualities

00:16:52.649 --> 00:16:54.649
at 2 Peter, chapter 1,

00:16:54.649 --> 00:16:56.649
verses 5 through 10,

00:16:56.649 --> 00:16:59.649
into your heart as best I could.

00:16:59.649 --> 00:17:02.649
Put forth all earnest effort

00:17:02.649 --> 00:17:04.650
to supply to your faith

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:06.650
virtue,

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:07.650
to your virtue,

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:09.650
knowledge,

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:11.650
to your knowledge,

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:13.650
self-control.

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:15.650
To your self-control,

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:17.650
endurance,

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:19.650
to your endurance,

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:21.650
godly devotion,

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:23.650
to your godly devotion,

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:25.650
brotherly affection,

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:29.650
to your brotherly affection,

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:31.650
love.

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:34.650
For if you keep on doing these things,

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:36.650
you will by no means

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:38.650
ever fail.

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:45.349
Love, dead.
