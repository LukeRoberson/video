00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:22.199
Just now, see the love on each face

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:36.490
Out there in the fires of shame

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:48.369
Glad to leave that old house that's promised

00:00:48.369 --> 00:01:17.040
That's what you want, that's what

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:49.500
Like the cares of the way you stand and feel hard to

00:01:49.500 --> 00:02:10.919
And faith has promised

00:02:10.919 --> 00:03:07.610
That's what you want, that's what you want
