00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:07.440
Think back for a moment on how Jehovah supported his organization in ancient times.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.919
One example is Bezileu.

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:11.720
Do you remember him?

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.720
Jehovah appointed him to make furnishings for the tabernacle.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.039
That's quite a responsibility.

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.160
But what experience did Bezileu have?

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.559
His last job was making bricks in Egypt.

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:29.219
While it is possible he had some other skills, how would he accomplish something as grand

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:31.739
as the tabernacle?

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:38.179
Exodus chapter 35 teaches us that it was Jehovah, that gave Bezileu the wisdom and the

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:41.299
understanding to do the work.

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:45.340
Jehovah's earthly organization today faces similar challenges.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.780
The brothers that took the lead in setting up our first primary had no prior experience.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.179
And the same applies to brothers that produced our very first video.

00:00:55.179 --> 00:01:00.380
You will enjoy this archive interview with Brother Lyman Swingle, who was part of that

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.859
very first video team.

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:07.019
Brother Swingle was later appointed as a member of the governing body until he finished

00:01:07.019 --> 00:01:11.140
his earthly course in 2001.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.900
The headquarters of the Watchtower Bible and Track Society, a center of new world action.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.780
We were given instructions while finding out make a film of world headquarters and what

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.900
we do here and show it in film.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:32.060
Well, I thought it was a great idea myself because I was interested in photography.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.379
Bethel means the house of God.

00:01:34.379 --> 00:01:39.900
How many people would like to visit here and don't have the opportunity and let them see

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.700
what the new world society is in action because I think a tour through this place will give

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.459
them the concept of the whole organization.

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:54.579
They appointed a team of three to write a script.

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:57.579
So they put this script together.

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.459
Just across the East River from all this.

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:06.459
There was a brother in Hollywood that was connected with the film industry.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:13.699
He was sort of an amateur photographer and he was around them all the time and knew their

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:14.699
techniques.

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:17.300
It's like many other things the society does.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.460
They don't have professionals that do it.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.300
No, mostly they're brought in here and they learn.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:31.770
Maybe they have a brother like this brother that came here that knew some of the basics.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:39.729
We went over to New York and rented the lights and many of the equipment that was necessary.

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:42.530
All he did is bring brought his camera here.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.370
At his desk, the society's president, Brother Norris, we thought, well, be best to start

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:55.490
with a president's office and work down through copy, follow the copy through its various

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.330
processes.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.129
We all work together for one purpose, one does one thing, someone does something else,

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:08.530
someone working in the treasurer's office, someone has to be president, someone has to

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.289
be dishwashers and serve food.

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:19.210
It's like the organs in the body, Paul said, you know, the hand can't say to the foot

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.449
I have no need of you, we all need everybody.

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:26.530
Here is the publication of the New World Society.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.370
Jehovah has fed us through its pages and he will continue to do so.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.409
After they had shot it, well then it had run longer taking it than they expected it got

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:41.770
into the time of convention and the brother says, oh, he says, why don't we take the convention

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.449
and put it on here too?

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:48.250
And so, well, why don't we do it in color?

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.969
Color, those days was really something and that even gave the film a much bigger boost

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:59.449
when they've been looking at the black and white and then suddenly they get a burst of

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:03.610
color for the convention.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:10.689
They had the trailer camp where everybody camped out there, Yankee Stadium and all of that

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:11.689
in color.

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:17.730
Oh, that really made a real climax to that picture because you weren't used to seeing

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.370
color except in the big theaters.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.930
In the evening, the students told of life a gillian and entertained with a pleasant program

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.769
of songs from their native lands.

00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:34.810
There were some very trying moments wondering whether it's ever going to be completed because

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.649
after we shot it, the brother that shot it was going to edit it too.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.620
But something came up in his life, he couldn't do it.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.269
Now we're stuck, what are we going to do?

00:04:51.269 --> 00:04:56.029
So then the decision is, well, let's do it ourselves.

00:04:56.029 --> 00:05:00.709
We'd never done it before, but we'll tackle it and see what we can do.

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:04.750
And we got a lab over in New York that we made a deal with them.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.750
Look, we'll give you the business to duplicate these.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:16.110
If you take somebody over there and show them how to edit this thing, so for a few weeks

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.870
I went over there.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.709
It's like any project here.

00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:26.629
Every job here for the average Bethelite that comes in, he doesn't know anything about

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:31.589
running a press or washing dishes or anything else, we teach him.

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:36.310
So that was just another job you learn how to do it.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.110
Making things these, but it is Jehovah's spirit that makes them possible.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.430
It is his work, not man's.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.430
After we did the original while we started editing it, we saw there were some gaps in

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:56.149
the film, not smooth dissolves from one department to another.

00:05:56.149 --> 00:06:05.750
And so the brother had gone away, so we rented a camera again on lights and so on and came

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:13.910
back and did it all on our own, the brothers here, filled in some gaps so we could go from

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:19.149
some scene to another scene real smooth like.

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:25.430
One of those shows how do you get the paper from the docks up to the press room?

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:32.029
So we had a scene where they're rolling the paper off the truck right into the camera.

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:37.889
And then the next scene shows a roll of paper being rolled onto the press and that made

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:44.870
a nice transition from the docks where the paper comes in to the press room.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.550
And there were some others like that that we filled in later.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:54.589
Was a compliment to Jehovah's people putting out something like that back in those days.

00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:59.350
But it illustrates that you don't have to go off to college and get a high education

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:07.029
to do something if Jehovah's spirit is upon it and blesses the project.

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:13.149
Many people have benefited from it and it often in my mind throws back to what the brothers

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:17.149
did when they made the photodrama creation.

00:07:17.149 --> 00:07:23.029
They too were amateurs at it, but my goodness, look at the final product.

00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:28.470
But this one here was really the only film I think the society made where they planned

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:34.589
out a script, wrote the script, and then followed through and shooting it and editing it

00:07:34.589 --> 00:07:37.629
and producing it themselves.

00:07:37.629 --> 00:07:44.230
It's the same way today when the society undertakes something, they strike out in open space

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:45.910
and start flying.

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:52.550
They never flew before, but maybe they have a few crash landings along the way, but they

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:57.589
pick themselves up and get back up flying again.

00:07:57.589 --> 00:08:02.149
The New World Society is indeed in action.

00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:10.389
I think it's another example of how the society has used technology and various features to

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:14.629
further the advertising of the king and the kingdom all down through the years.
