00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:13.419
The Democratic Republic of Congo, also called the DRC, is an African country that is almost

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:16.300
one quarter the size of Europe.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:23.500
Yet, despite the challenges, Jehovah's Witnesses successfully distribute Bibles and Bible-based

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:31.989
publications to the people of Congo.

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:37.350
This journey begins at the South Africa branch office of Jehovah's Witnesses, commonly known

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.670
as Bethel.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.630
Journals and other publications are printed here, and these are loaded onto trucks traveling

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.109
to Congo.

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:55.420
Each month, these trucks pass through many borders, a journey of 4,500 kilometers.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.420
They would take about 21 days to travel towards the equator, cutting through some of the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.620
most challenging conditions in Africa, to arrive safely at the Kinshasa branch office

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.299
in Congo.

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.299
But some of the literature still has a long way to go.

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:19.340
From Kinshasa, a boat would travel up to Congo River for 14 days, covering a distance

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:30.670
of 1,200 kilometers.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.109
It is in this part of the journey that the literature crosses the equator to reach

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:42.120
Bumba.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.840
Because infrastructure is limited, bicycles and motorcycles are the most practical means

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.150
of transport on land.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:02:08.870
In Bumba, the local witnesses quickly coordinate efforts to deliver the literature on time.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:14.830
Philippe volunteers to travel from Bumba to Yandongi, a village about 100 kilometers

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:22.090
away, with a load of 180 kilograms on his bicycle.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.409
I tried to make the trip in only two days so I can be back to study the Bible with my

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:32.639
family.

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:39.759
In another route, he travels from Bumba to Bondo, this 425 kilometer trek takes seven days

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:43.039
one way.

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:48.919
The roads are badly maintained and when it rains, the state of the roads is terrible,

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:56.139
ecotastrophe.

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:02.300
When I arrive that the brothers with the literature, everyone receives me with cries of happiness.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.300
They are the ones who have floated my bike, keep it upright and have floated the peg

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.300
trees.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:15.229
By then, I am sitting somewhere and I feel very content.

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:22.629
Mathieu will travel 200 kilometers upstream in his canoe to deliver literature to Mombongo.

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:28.629
He is one of the volunteers who help transport the literature on its epic journey every

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:29.629
month.

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:33.509
It usually takes him four days, depending on the weather.

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:37.789
For me, this journey is like working at Bethel.

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:42.030
When I'm in a dugout canoe, I feel like I'm in a floating Bethel.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.590
When we arrive, the brothers welcome us with love.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.110
They are really happy and thankful for the provision given by his organization to have

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.270
the literature reach them on time.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:03.099
The watchtower is published simultaneously in over 240 languages around the world.

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:08.500
This epic journey into the far reaches of Congo is one example of the efforts drove us

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.020
witnesses make to share the Bible's life-saving message.
