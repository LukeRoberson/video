00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:06.839
We depend on many powerful man-made things to deliver the items that we need.

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.339
For example, a powerful freight train can climb steep hills and deliver its freight on time.

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:18.839
A powerful cargo ship can withstand high seas and deliver its cargo.

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:22.839
But there is a limit to what man's ingenuity can do.

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:29.839
When it comes to our most crucial needs, such as true peace, real security and lasting happiness,

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.939
humans promise what they do not have the power to deliver.

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:41.240
Political, religious and financial institutions have proved to be untrustworthy.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:49.240
With so many promises broken, we're not surprised that many people are skeptical about the future.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.740
But in contrast to such failures, Jehovah's promises never fail.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.640
And we are made more powerful when we trust in his promises.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.140
He always delivers on his word.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.939
Jehovah promises to sustain us through any trials, no matter how intense they may become.

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:12.340
Consider Jesus example.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.939
No human has faced trials more intense than what he experienced.

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:22.939
Yet Jesus had faith that delivered, powerful faith that carried him through.

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:29.439
With freeness of speech, Jesus encouraged his followers to have faith and not to doubt.

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.739
For example, on one occasion while traveling near Bethany with his disciples,

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:42.040
Jesus used a fig tree to provide an object lesson on the need to have faith in God.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:49.340
The account in Matthew chapter 21 tells us that the fig tree was barren except for leaves.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.640
In verses 19 and 20, Jesus said to the tree,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.439
let no fruit come from you ever again.

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.040
And the fig tree withered instantly.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.739
Now as a result, the disciples were amazed and they asked Jesus,

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:08.439
how is it that the fig tree withered instantly?

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:14.849
As we read Jesus reply to them in verses 21 and 22,

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:21.050
please keep in mind that Jesus is providing an object lesson for them.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.250
So let's pull out the lesson about faith as we read verses 21 and 22.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.750
And answer Jesus said to them, truly I say to you,

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.550
if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you do what I did to the fig tree,

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.750
but even if you say to this mountain, be lifted up and thrown into the sea,

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.150
it will happen. And all the things you ask in prayer having faith,

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.650
you will receive.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.250
That was a powerful object lesson on faith,

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.250
especially in view of the trials that his disciples would soon experience.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.550
But do you see any more object lessons in this example?

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.449
There's another connection between what happened to the fig tree and having faith.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.650
You see, the nation of Israel like that fig tree had a deceptive appearance.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.150
Although the nation was in a covenant relationship with God,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.150
it proved to be without faith and it was barren of good fruitage.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.449
It even rejected God's own son.

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:28.750
So by causing the unproductive fig tree to wither,

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:35.150
Jesus demonstrated what the end result would be for those without faith.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:42.150
To benefit from this object lesson today, we also need to have faith and not doubt.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.150
In this talk, we will discuss four situations that show how prayer,

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:53.449
study, and meditation can help us to rely fully on Jehovah's promises.

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:57.349
With each situation, we will look at the challenge we face,

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:03.050
the promise we've received, and our reason for faith in that promise.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.750
Here's the first situation. It is when we are tempted.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.050
What is the challenge?

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.250
The challenge is to avoid giving into temptation.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.750
There are many things that contempt us to go down a wrong path and show a lack of faith.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.449
We could be tempted by immoral desires that violate God's laws and principles.

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:32.550
We could be tempted to set spiritual interests aside and pursue material things.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:39.250
We could be tempted to become prideful and ambitiously try to outdo others.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.750
We must never allow that to happen.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:49.350
The fact is that there are many things that could tempt us to show a lack of faith and of trust in Jehovah.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.750
So now there's the challenge. Here is the promise.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.449
Let's see Jehovah's promise in his word.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:04.449
It is twofold or two-part, and we find it at 1 Corinthians chapter 10 and in verse 13.

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:09.949
As we read it, look for the promise, verse 13.

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:14.250
No temptation has come upon you except what is common to men.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.750
But God is faithful, and He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:26.350
But along with the temptation, He will also make the way out so that you may be able to endure it.

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:28.649
What is the promise here?

00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:34.750
First, Jehovah will not let us be tempted beyond what we can bear or handle.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.649
Also, Jehovah will help us.

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:46.250
He will make the way out for us, it said, that is out of any temptation if we rely on Him.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.050
We must have faith and not doubt.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.550
So far, we've considered the challenge and the promise.

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:57.850
Now let's examine our reason for faith in that promise.

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.550
Our reason for faith is this.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:08.550
Jehovah knows us better than we know ourselves, and his word says that we can remain faithful.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:16.149
In Deuteronomy 30 and verse 11, Jehovah told the Israelites that what he required of them was not too difficult,

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:19.649
nor was it beyond their reach, he said.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.750
So for good reason, he expected them to show faith and to obey.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.550
He expects no less of his servants today.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:35.050
Let's consider some practical steps that will help us to resist temptations.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.550
We will list them first, and then we will look more closely at two of the steps.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.350
First, pray regularly for the needed strength.

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:51.250
Second, study and meditate so as to keep your mind fixed on Jehovah's promises.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:59.250
Third, know your weaknesses, and fourth, avoid situations that would increase temptation.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:03.250
Now let's look more closely at steps three and four.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:11.050
That is the need to know our weaknesses and how to avoid situations that cause temptation for us.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.750
We're going to begin with a chain.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:20.050
It's a fact that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, true.

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.550
Where it is weak is where it will break first.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:27.750
Like a chain, we have weaknesses that others may not see,

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:31.649
but we should know our weaknesses.

00:07:31.649 --> 00:07:36.850
Make certain that you know yourself and that you know where you are most vulnerable.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:40.149
When we know our weaknesses, we know what to guard against.

00:07:40.149 --> 00:07:45.350
In other words, we know where the weak link is.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:50.350
When we know our weaknesses, then we are able to stand firm in the faith.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:55.149
One sister said, when I face temptation, I reject it immediately.

00:07:55.149 --> 00:08:01.050
Letting the mind dwell on the possibilities is what gets you into trouble in the first place.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:06.949
So again, know your weaknesses and guard against those weaknesses.

00:08:06.949 --> 00:08:13.449
Another important step that we listed is to avoid situations that increase temptation.

00:08:13.449 --> 00:08:19.250
Stay away from people whose speech and conduct make wrongdoing look attractive.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:25.149
Remove yourself from situations where you know you're going to face temptations.

00:08:25.149 --> 00:08:29.850
Surround yourself with friends who encourage you to do what is right.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:32.549
Proverbs 22 and verse 3 says,

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:36.649
that the shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself,

00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:41.950
but the inexperienced keep right on going and suffer the consequences.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:49.049
We prove to be shrewd when we trust that inspired statement and avoid temptation.

00:08:49.049 --> 00:08:55.250
So in review, when we are tempted, we looked at the challenge, the promise,

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.850
and our reason for faith in that promise.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:00.950
Then we considered what will help us to succeed,

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:07.149
which included the need to pray regularly and to study and meditate on God's Word.

00:09:07.149 --> 00:09:12.950
With each of the next three situations we will follow the same pattern.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:17.549
The next situation in which we must rely on Jehovah's promise

00:09:17.549 --> 00:09:21.450
has to do with when we face opposition.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:22.950
Here's the challenge.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:26.850
Avoid compromising under pressure.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:33.450
No doubt all of us think at times about how we would handle various problems that may eventually confront us.

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.549
Such mental exercises can be helpful,

00:09:36.549 --> 00:09:43.149
provided that we remember that Jehovah will always be with us when we are doing his will,

00:09:43.149 --> 00:09:45.750
which brings us to his promise.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:50.850
Jehovah will give us his Holy Spirit so that we can endure opposition.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:54.549
Jesus is one who trusted in that promise.

00:09:54.549 --> 00:10:00.049
He also urged his followers to remain calm and show trust.

00:10:00.049 --> 00:10:04.049
Consider what he said at Luke 12, 11 and 12.

00:10:04.049 --> 00:10:07.250
Now, as we read Jesus' words,

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:13.649
have in mind that the scribes and the Pharisees were putting extreme pressure on him with many questions

00:10:13.649 --> 00:10:18.049
in an effort to use Jesus' words against him.

00:10:18.049 --> 00:10:19.950
Of course, they failed.

00:10:20.049 --> 00:10:23.250
And Jesus here gives assurance that like him,

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:30.049
we too will succeed when persecution comes if we have faith and do not doubt.

00:10:30.049 --> 00:10:34.149
At Luke 12, 11 and 12, Jesus said,

00:10:34.149 --> 00:10:36.850
when they bring you in before public assemblies,

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:39.450
government officials and authorities,

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:43.950
do not become anxious about how or what you will speak in defense

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:45.649
or what you will say.

00:10:45.649 --> 00:10:52.350
For the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour the things you should say.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:58.250
How can we receive the benefits of this promise when opposition comes?

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:02.149
By listening carefully to Jesus' words there,

00:11:02.149 --> 00:11:04.950
do not become anxious, Jesus said,

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:06.750
remain calm.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:11.549
For the Holy Spirit will teach you, show trust.

00:11:11.649 --> 00:11:16.649
Jesus is the greatest example of one who lived by those very words,

00:11:16.649 --> 00:11:20.350
and we can too, but it takes faith.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:23.850
So again, we've looked at the challenge and the promise.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:28.450
Now, let's examine our reason for faith in that promise.

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:30.049
And it is this.

00:11:30.049 --> 00:11:37.549
Jehovah is more powerful, infinitely more powerful than any opposer.

00:11:37.549 --> 00:11:40.450
Here are three things all centered on Jehovah

00:11:40.549 --> 00:11:44.950
that will help us to face persecution and opposition.

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:49.250
First, pray regularly, and when doing so,

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:54.950
express your fears to Jehovah and ask for the peace of God.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:56.549
In the book of Lamentations,

00:11:56.549 --> 00:12:02.549
the inspired writer urged God's people to pour out their heart like water.

00:12:02.549 --> 00:12:08.049
Water can flow quickly, and like water flowing out of a large bucket,

00:12:08.149 --> 00:12:12.850
we should not hold back when praying to our Heavenly Father,

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:17.250
especially whenever we are faced with opposition and persecution,

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:20.149
pour out your heart to Him,

00:12:20.149 --> 00:12:23.450
and Jehovah promises that He will help you.

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:29.450
We must have faith in Jehovah's power to help us and trust in that promise.

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:30.850
As Jesus said,

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.750
do not become anxious.

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:37.450
Strong faith will help us to avoid such anxiety.

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:41.149
Second, we are also helped to face opposition when we study

00:12:41.149 --> 00:12:43.950
and meditate on God's Word.

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:48.649
Daily Bible reading helps to strengthen our conviction that Jehovah loves us

00:12:48.649 --> 00:12:51.149
and that He will never abandon us.

00:12:51.149 --> 00:12:55.850
Focus on His tender qualities as you read His words.

00:12:55.850 --> 00:13:01.649
A field Jehovah's love for you in the things that He says and does.

00:13:01.649 --> 00:13:05.850
As you meditate on the words and works of Jehovah,

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:09.250
reflect on your own experience in His service.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:14.750
You'll likely be able to list many things that our Heavenly Father has done for you

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:17.350
since you started to serve Him.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:24.450
Yes, Bible reading and meditation draw us closer to Jehovah, our source of strength.

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:27.049
And the more your confidence in Him grows,

00:13:27.049 --> 00:13:29.850
the stronger your bond with Him will become,

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:33.250
and the stronger your faith in Him will become.

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:35.350
Now related to what we just mentioned,

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:38.549
a third thing that will help you when opposition comes

00:13:38.549 --> 00:13:43.350
is to reflect on how Jehovah has helped you through trials in the past.

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:47.250
And that is exactly what David did.

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:50.049
At Psalm 18 and verse 6, he said,

00:13:50.049 --> 00:13:53.149
in my distress I called to Jehovah,

00:13:53.149 --> 00:13:55.950
to my God I kept crying for help.

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:59.750
From His temple He heard my voice

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:03.950
and my cry for help reached His ears.

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:06.850
So did David recall Jehovah's help?

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:08.250
Yes, he did.

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:10.750
He heard my voice, David said,

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:14.750
and my cry for help reached His ears.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.250
David not only remembered what had happened,

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:21.850
he had faith that Jehovah heard Him.

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:25.850
David was still putting that blessing to work because he never forgot

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:28.950
all that Jehovah had done for him.

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:32.250
When you know that Jehovah has helped you,

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:37.250
when you just know it, never forget it.

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:39.850
We show gratitude when we remember

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:42.350
and such experiences strengthen us

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:46.250
to face the trials yet ahead of us.

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:49.049
Now so far we've considered the need for faith

00:14:49.049 --> 00:14:53.250
when we are tempted and when we face opposition.

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:56.149
Now we will again follow the same pattern

00:14:56.149 --> 00:14:58.649
with the third situation

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:01.850
when we are afflicted with illness.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:03.850
What is the challenge?

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:06.750
The challenge we face when we are seriously ill

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:12.049
is to avoid questioning whether Jehovah will care for us.

00:15:12.049 --> 00:15:14.350
We must continue to remind ourselves

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:16.950
that Jehovah loves us

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:19.250
and that he will never abandon us.

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.350
Remember the promise.

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:25.250
Jehovah will sustain his loyal ones who are sick

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:27.950
and that promise is not just a general feeling

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:30.549
that you get from reading his word.

00:15:30.549 --> 00:15:35.549
That promise is a clear statement found in Psalm 41 and verse 3.

00:15:35.549 --> 00:15:41.049
We invite you to read it, Psalm 41 and verse 3.

00:15:41.049 --> 00:15:43.549
But is it a promise to cure us?

00:15:43.549 --> 00:15:45.750
Notice what it says.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:49.950
Jehovah will sustain him on his sick bed.

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:51.250
During his sickness,

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:55.049
you will completely change his bed.

00:15:55.149 --> 00:15:58.350
Did Jehovah use the word cure here?

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:01.350
No, he said sustain.

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:03.649
Jehovah will sustain us.

00:16:03.649 --> 00:16:06.549
The cure will come later.

00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:09.250
But his promise to sustain his servants

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:12.049
is a promise that we can trust.

00:16:12.049 --> 00:16:15.649
Here is our reason for faith in that promise.

00:16:15.649 --> 00:16:18.049
We know that Jehovah has compassion

00:16:18.049 --> 00:16:21.450
for those who are disadvantaged by poor health

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:23.350
among other things.

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:25.250
In verse 1 of that same Psalm,

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:29.649
we are assured that Jehovah will rescue the lowly one.

00:16:29.649 --> 00:16:32.250
Jehovah makes a similar loving expression

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:36.049
at Isaiah 57 and verse 15.

00:16:36.049 --> 00:16:37.750
There he says,

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:41.149
I reside in the high and lofty place

00:16:41.149 --> 00:16:44.750
but also with those crushed and lowly in spirit

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:47.850
to revive the spirit of the lowly one

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:52.649
and to revive the heart of those being crushed.

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:55.850
I reside in the holy place he said,

00:16:55.850 --> 00:17:00.850
yet also with those crushed and lowly in spirit.

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:04.650
Jehovah cares deeply for us, doesn't he?

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:05.650
In his compassion,

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:09.750
he draws close to his faithful ones who are ill.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:13.750
But while we should have faith that Jehovah will sustain us

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:15.349
and that is true, of course,

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:17.849
whenever we face serious illness,

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:21.450
what steps must we take to cope?

00:17:21.549 --> 00:17:23.349
Here are three things that we can do

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:26.849
to work along with Jehovah's loving support.

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:30.549
First, pray regularly for practical wisdom

00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:32.849
to deal with your illness.

00:17:32.849 --> 00:17:35.650
James 1 and verse 6 says,

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:40.250
keep asking in faith not doubting at all.

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:41.849
Earlier Jesus said,

00:17:41.849 --> 00:17:45.049
have faith and do not doubt.

00:17:45.049 --> 00:17:48.950
One sister with strong faith saw the need to do her part

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:51.750
when she found out that she was seriously ill.

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:53.549
She said,

00:17:53.549 --> 00:17:57.150
when I learned that I had cancer in my lung and colon,

00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:00.450
I thought that I had just received a death sentence.

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:02.349
But after I got home from the doctor,

00:18:02.349 --> 00:18:06.349
I thought, okay, it's not what I expected,

00:18:06.349 --> 00:18:09.950
but I have to find a way to deal with this.

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:11.849
So what did she do?

00:18:11.849 --> 00:18:15.750
She prayed and not just any prayer.

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:20.150
She says, I never pray, make me better.

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:25.650
I always pray, help me be strong and endure my illness.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:27.349
Beautiful example.

00:18:27.349 --> 00:18:32.650
That sister understands Psalm 41 and verse 3, doesn't she?

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:35.250
If we do not recover from an illness,

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:39.950
we have faith that the cure is coming in God's new world.

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:40.750
In the meantime,

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:43.250
we also have faith in Jehovah's promise

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:45.950
that he will sustain us through any trial,

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:46.950
any illness.

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:51.450
He will change our bed as the verse said,

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:53.450
meaning that Jehovah will see to it

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:57.849
that our sick bed will not be one of hopelessness.

00:18:57.849 --> 00:19:03.349
Rather, we will endure with faith and hope.

00:19:03.349 --> 00:19:05.349
Many have found that their greatest comfort

00:19:05.349 --> 00:19:07.349
comes from heartfelt prayer

00:19:07.349 --> 00:19:11.150
and from reading such comforting passages in God's word.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.549
When we do this,

00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:14.849
Jehovah will give us strength

00:19:14.849 --> 00:19:18.450
and he will bring comforting thoughts to our mind.

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:21.750
That brings us to the second thing that we can do

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:24.250
to work along with Jehovah's promise

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:25.450
and his loving support.

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:30.450
And it is this study and meditate on Jehovah's promises

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:34.650
in order to strengthen your conviction in the new world

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:37.950
where you all have perfect health.

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:39.750
That time is coming.

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:43.549
As Isaiah 33 verse 24 foretells,

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:45.549
no resident will say,

00:19:45.549 --> 00:19:47.650
I am sick.

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:50.950
But we can meditate on such wonderful promises

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:55.549
only if we take the time to read them.

00:19:55.549 --> 00:20:00.549
So take time to read a portion of God's word every day.

00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:02.950
Give close attention to the Psalms

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:06.650
and to what Jesus did during his earthly ministry.

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:09.049
Such accounts provide real life examples

00:20:09.049 --> 00:20:11.049
not only of coping,

00:20:11.049 --> 00:20:15.049
but also of godly compassion for those who are ill.

00:20:15.049 --> 00:20:17.349
And we also have such real life examples

00:20:17.349 --> 00:20:19.950
of compassion among us today.

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:22.450
So the third thing that those who are afflicted

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:26.150
with illness can do is benefit from association

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:30.250
with fellow believers to the extent possible.

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:32.849
We've come to appreciate this even more

00:20:32.849 --> 00:20:36.650
after living through a pandemic, isn't that true?

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:40.549
One sister who has coped with serious illness says this,

00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:42.549
do not isolate yourself.

00:20:42.549 --> 00:20:44.650
Allow friends to help you.

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:47.250
There may be times when you feel alone,

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:50.349
but don't isolate yourself.

00:20:50.349 --> 00:20:54.950
That's wise advice and it is scriptural advice.

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:58.950
Always remember that the love we see among Jehovah's people

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:03.549
is just a reflection of how he feels about us.

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:06.950
After all, he gave us the ability to love others

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:09.950
and his people show that God-like love

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:11.950
for one another every day.

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:16.349
So put your faith in Jehovah's sustaining power.

00:21:16.349 --> 00:21:20.950
Put your faith in the comfort from the scriptures as well

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:24.349
as the loving support of family and friends.

00:21:24.349 --> 00:21:28.549
Put your faith in Jehovah's sure promises

00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:32.849
and hold on to the assurance that life is worth living

00:21:32.849 --> 00:21:38.250
even when you are afflicted with a serious illness.

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:41.549
In all that we have considered about Jehovah's promises,

00:21:41.549 --> 00:21:46.349
we see that faith is the essential quality that we need to have.

00:21:46.349 --> 00:21:48.549
We need faith when we are tempted.

00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:51.049
Faith when we face opposition

00:21:51.049 --> 00:21:55.349
and faith when we are afflicted with serious illness.

00:21:55.349 --> 00:22:00.049
We also need faith when we face economic hardship.

00:22:00.049 --> 00:22:04.150
After all, we must have certain things to survive day to day

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:08.950
and to continue on in our service to Jehovah.

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:11.950
The question is, how well do we cope

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:16.450
when getting the necessities of life becomes difficult for us?

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:20.250
Food, clothing, shelter, transportation, and so forth?

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:22.750
You see, when these things become hard to get,

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:24.950
it can cause anxiety.

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:26.849
That's a fact, it can.

00:22:26.849 --> 00:22:29.650
And avoiding such anxiety is a challenge

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:31.250
we may face.

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:33.049
If we ever face that challenge,

00:22:33.049 --> 00:22:35.549
what must we call to our mind?

00:22:35.549 --> 00:22:37.849
Jehovah's promise.

00:22:37.849 --> 00:22:41.450
Jehovah promises that if we put the kingdom first,

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:44.950
he will provide the things that we need.

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:47.250
We must have faith in that promise.

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:50.349
Strong faith in that promise.

00:22:50.349 --> 00:22:53.750
It's a promise that Jesus made very clear for us.

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:56.450
God's son understood that in this system of things,

00:22:56.450 --> 00:23:00.450
his economic hardship would sometimes befall God's people.

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:03.049
And he made it a point to include some comments

00:23:03.049 --> 00:23:07.650
about this challenge in his well-known sermon on the mount.

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:09.349
But along with the challenge,

00:23:09.349 --> 00:23:12.349
he provided Jehovah's promise.

00:23:12.349 --> 00:23:16.349
Please follow along as we read Matthew chapter 6

00:23:16.349 --> 00:23:18.750
and verse 33.

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:22.519
Matthew 6, 33.

00:23:22.519 --> 00:23:25.819
Jesus lived as a human.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.920
And here's a point we want to keep in mind

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.220
as we get ready to read this verse.

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:33.920
He grew up in a hard-working family.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:37.420
It may be that acquiring the necessities of life

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:40.019
did not always come easy for them.

00:23:40.019 --> 00:23:42.019
But they trusted in Jehovah

00:23:42.019 --> 00:23:44.420
and they had what they needed to serve him.

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:46.720
So what Jesus later said here,

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.220
in Matthew 6, 33,

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:50.420
he said as a real person,

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.819
a human who knew what people faced at times.

00:23:53.819 --> 00:23:54.920
So with that context,

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.920
he had just urged his listeners to stop being anxious

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:02.119
and to trust in Jehovah's ability to help them

00:24:02.119 --> 00:24:05.220
and then he gave the promise in verse 33.

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:06.720
Keep on then, he said,

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.920
seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:15.420
and all these other things will be added to you.

00:24:16.319 --> 00:24:18.819
The conviction in that statement

00:24:18.819 --> 00:24:20.920
will be added,

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:25.019
stems from the certainty of the promise.

00:24:25.019 --> 00:24:29.519
Jehovah cannot lie and his son does not lie.

00:24:29.519 --> 00:24:33.119
If we put the interest of the kingdom first,

00:24:33.119 --> 00:24:37.319
we'll experience the blessings that come from that promise.

00:24:37.319 --> 00:24:41.319
We have many reasons to have faith in those words.

00:24:41.319 --> 00:24:44.019
Consider, Jehovah provides daily

00:24:44.019 --> 00:24:47.720
for the needs of plants and of birds.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.819
So how much more so for his faithful servants?

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.920
We know that this is true not only because

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.819
the Scriptures tell us so,

00:24:54.819 --> 00:24:57.819
but also because we see it for ourselves.

00:24:57.819 --> 00:25:01.420
At Matthew 6, 26 through 29,

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:05.519
just before urging his disciples to put the kingdom first,

00:25:05.519 --> 00:25:11.220
Jesus invited them to observe intently the birds of heaven.

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.519
Now why?

00:25:12.519 --> 00:25:15.920
What did he want his disciples to see?

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:19.619
He wanted them to see how our Heavenly Father cares

00:25:19.619 --> 00:25:21.119
for those little creatures,

00:25:21.119 --> 00:25:23.519
how he looks after them and sees

00:25:23.519 --> 00:25:25.619
that they have their daily food.

00:25:25.619 --> 00:25:27.319
They have what they need.

00:25:27.319 --> 00:25:30.519
Birds do not spend their days feeling anxious

00:25:30.519 --> 00:25:32.619
and neither should we.

00:25:32.619 --> 00:25:34.220
Jesus rhetorically asked,

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:38.220
are you not worth more than they are?

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:40.619
Such lessons remind us that we should trust

00:25:40.619 --> 00:25:46.420
Jehovah's promise and in his ability and desire to keep it.

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:48.619
We learn from Jesus' sermon on the mount

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:53.619
that real happiness and security do not depend on material things.

00:25:53.619 --> 00:25:57.920
What matters is our friendship with our Heavenly Father.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.720
So there are the lessons,

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.619
but in practical terms,

00:26:01.619 --> 00:26:05.920
how can you avoid anxiety over economic hardship?

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:09.019
Remember to pray continually.

00:26:09.019 --> 00:26:10.819
When anxiety takes hold of a person,

00:26:10.819 --> 00:26:13.019
he or she might overlook things

00:26:13.019 --> 00:26:16.220
that they normally would never overlook.

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:20.019
Keep praying and have faith in Jehovah's promise.

00:26:20.019 --> 00:26:23.019
He listens to our prayers.

00:26:23.019 --> 00:26:25.220
And pray just as Jesus taught us,

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.519
not for financial security,

00:26:27.519 --> 00:26:29.519
but for our daily needs,

00:26:29.519 --> 00:26:32.920
our bread for this day, as he said.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:33.920
And along with prayer,

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:37.819
remember to study and meditate on God's word each day.

00:26:37.819 --> 00:26:39.720
This too can be overlooked

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.519
when one feels overwhelmed.

00:26:42.519 --> 00:26:44.420
Don't let that happen to you.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:46.519
Jehovah will see your effort

00:26:46.519 --> 00:26:50.220
and he will bless you for relying on him.

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.019
Study and meditate in order to strengthen your conviction

00:26:53.019 --> 00:26:55.220
that Jehovah will take care of you.

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:58.619
He promises to do so.

00:26:58.619 --> 00:27:01.920
In all of this, don't forget your past blessings.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:05.420
Just as Jehovah sustained his people in the past,

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:08.220
reflect on how Jehovah has helped you.

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:10.119
He has not changed.

00:27:10.119 --> 00:27:14.019
Use that experience to build up your faith and your conviction

00:27:14.119 --> 00:27:17.119
that Jehovah will go on helping you

00:27:17.119 --> 00:27:19.119
through difficult times.

00:27:20.319 --> 00:27:23.319
We live in a largely faithless and skeptical world,

00:27:23.319 --> 00:27:24.920
isn't that true?

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.119
We need faith.

00:27:26.119 --> 00:27:27.319
And when we have it,

00:27:27.319 --> 00:27:29.920
we must keep it strong.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:33.720
When we have faith in Jehovah's promises and do not doubt,

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:37.519
we are helped to face whatever may come our way.

00:27:37.519 --> 00:27:40.220
We are helped when we are tempted,

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:42.519
when we face opposition,

00:27:42.619 --> 00:27:44.920
when we are afflicted with illness

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.920
and when we experience economic hardship.

00:27:48.819 --> 00:27:51.519
In these critical last days,

00:27:51.519 --> 00:27:53.119
all of us, each one of us,

00:27:53.119 --> 00:27:55.920
needs to keep growing in faith.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.619
Cultivate the yearning that Jesus apostles had

00:27:58.619 --> 00:28:00.420
toward growing in faith.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:04.019
We can see their desire in what they said to Jesus

00:28:04.019 --> 00:28:08.519
in Luke chapter 17 and in verse five.

00:28:08.519 --> 00:28:11.420
Luke 17 five, please go to that verse.

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:15.920
And we will also read Jesus reply to them in verse six.

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:21.119
After hearing Jesus warn about those who caused stumbling,

00:28:21.119 --> 00:28:23.720
we read starting in verse five,

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.319
that the apostles said to the Lord,

00:28:26.319 --> 00:28:30.420
give us more faith than the Lord said.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.619
If you had faith the size of a mustard grain,

00:28:33.619 --> 00:28:36.519
you would say to this black mulberry tree,

00:28:36.519 --> 00:28:39.920
be uprooted and planted in the sea.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.019
And it would obey you.

00:28:43.019 --> 00:28:47.019
In other words, have faith and do not doubt

00:28:47.019 --> 00:28:48.619
he was telling them.

00:28:48.619 --> 00:28:51.220
Now, it is extremely unlikely

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:55.220
that you will ever need to command a black mulberry tree

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:58.920
to uproot itself and be planted in the sea.

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:01.220
So then what was Jesus' point?

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:02.519
It is this.

00:29:02.519 --> 00:29:05.920
We are powerful by faith.

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:09.019
Challenges that may seem equally impossible

00:29:09.019 --> 00:29:14.019
have been overcome or defeated by our faith in God's power.

00:29:14.019 --> 00:29:18.819
Faith helps us to conquer any temptation that we face.

00:29:18.819 --> 00:29:21.720
Faith helps us to defeat any opposition

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.019
that rises up against us.

00:29:24.019 --> 00:29:28.519
Faith sustains us through any illness we may experience.

00:29:28.519 --> 00:29:31.720
And faith strengthens us to trust in Jehovah's promise

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.920
to support us during economic hardship.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.619
In other words, uproot the mulberry tree

00:29:37.619 --> 00:29:39.819
and plant it in the sea.

00:29:40.819 --> 00:29:43.920
As we considered in each of those situations,

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:47.920
we reviewed how prayer, study, and meditation

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.619
will help us to stay close to Jehovah,

00:29:50.619 --> 00:29:53.920
the one who will grant us more faith.

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.420
Pray for it each day.

00:29:56.420 --> 00:30:00.019
Inmitate examples of faith found in God's Word

00:30:00.019 --> 00:30:03.720
as well as those serving along with us today.

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:08.519
Remain focused on Jehovah who fulfills all of his promises

00:30:08.519 --> 00:30:14.019
and he will bless your efforts to have faith and not to doubt.
