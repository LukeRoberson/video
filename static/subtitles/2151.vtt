00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:17.039
And it lines growing on top of the hill

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.480
Mountains in the distance

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.480
Wind blowing through the field

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.179
Warped off the sun

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:28.179
Casting down from the sky

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.179
Birds fly up above clouds

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:34.179
Rolling by

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:36.179
What did I do?

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:39.619
To see such beauty

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:41.619
And what do I do?

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:45.619
To show how much I care

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:47.619
I got to be thankful

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:51.619
Telled you over in prayer

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:53.619
That I'm thankful

00:00:53.619 --> 00:01:11.969
You shared

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:17.969
I got to be thankful

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:41.950
I got to be thankful

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.799
The sky dancing

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.750
I do to see such beauty

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.859
But I know what to do

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:56.859
To show how much I care

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:29.139
I got to be thankful

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:31.139
I see your wisdom and the strength

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:33.139
Your goodness and everything

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:39.379
And how much you let out my soul

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.689
I've got to be thankful

00:02:42.689 --> 00:03:11.500
Telled you over for the love
