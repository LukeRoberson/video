00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:10.529
And in production to the book of Ezekiel, Ezekiel was the son of a priest, and served as

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:14.439
a prophet of Jehovah.

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:20.820
He lived in Judah until 617 BCE when Judean King Jehoyakin was forced to surrender to

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.339
Babylon.

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:30.820
Ezekiel was among the Jewish exiles whom King Nebuchadnezzar took to Babylon at that time.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:38.320
In 613 BCE, Jehovah commissioned Ezekiel to prophesy to the exiled Jews living in Babylonian

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.159
captivity.

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:45.979
Ezekiel faithfully fulfilled his assignment for at least 22 years.

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:51.259
He completed his book in about 591 BCE.

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:57.060
Ezekiel's prophetic work overlapped that of Obadaya and Jeremiah in Judah and of Daniel

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.030
in Babylon.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.069
The sanctification of Jehovah's name is highlighted throughout the book of Ezekiel.

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:15.030
The expression sovereign Lord Jehovah appears 217 times.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.030
The book of Ezekiel has 48 chapters.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:27.150
In chapters 1 to 3, we read about the awe-inspiring visions Ezekiel sees by the river Kibar.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.189
According in an intense windstorm, Ezekiel beholds four magnificent living creatures

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.150
or cherubs.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:43.069
Each one has four faces, that of a man, a lion, a bull, and an eagle.

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:49.030
These faces reflect attributes that Jehovah possesses.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.069
Ezekiel is awed by a vision of the heavenly part of Jehovah's organization, which is

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:59.790
represented by a celestial chariot directed by God's Spirit.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.030
Chapters 4 to 24 contain Jehovah's judgment against Jerusalem and her rebellious idolatrous

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.469
people.

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:14.550
Ezekiel often communicated Jehovah's prophecies by means of symbolic actions.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.870
For example, Jehovah had Ezekiel engraved the city of Jerusalem on a brick and staged

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.469
a mock siege against it.

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:30.389
As a sign of the coming siege, he lay on his side for 430 days.

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:36.710
In chapters 25 to 32, Jehovah turns his attention to the surrounding nations.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:42.270
They receive an adverse judgment because of their opposition to his people.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:50.900
Through Ezekiel, Jehovah foretells destruction for the city of Tyre and her king.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.900
Did you know?

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.819
The prophecy against Tyre was fulfilled in two stages.

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.460
Years after Nebuchadnezzar devastated the mainland city, Alexander the Great completed the

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:09.099
destruction by building a causeway to the island city of Tyre, using the rubble remaining

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:14.669
from Nebuchadnezzar's conquest.

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:22.550
Chapters 33 to 48 contain a message of hope and of the restoration of pure worship.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:29.590
In chapters 40 to 48, we read of Jehovah giving Ezekiel a vision of a temple.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:37.919
This vision of the temple underscores Jehovah's high standards for true worship.

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:44.479
As you study this prophetic book, take note of Jehovah's awe-inspiring qualities, Ezekiel's

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:50.680
unswerving obedience to his instructions, and Jehovah's promise to unite all mankind

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.360
in pure worship by means of the kingdom.
