00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:17.609
In the first century, when some in Macedonia heard that their fellow Christians in Jerusalem were in material need,

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.609
they literally begged the Apostle Paul for the privilege to help.

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.609
Today, we see a similar spirit of generosity among God's people.

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:35.609
Funds contributed by Cargation's worldwide are pooled to provide financial assistance.

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:42.609
For example, congregations around the world use video equipment at nearly every meeting.

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:52.609
But in some lands, challenges such as finances, infrastructure or security have prevented many from enjoying this form of teaching.

00:00:52.609 --> 00:01:04.609
For that reason, the governing body recently approved allocating funds annually to assist congregations that are unable to afford necessary video equipment.

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:19.609
We live in a territory where there is so much poverty that it is difficult even for an entire congregation to gather the money needed to buy a video kit for the meetings.

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:24.609
It is not easy for the brothers in Malawi to get the videos.

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:30.609
Without a projector, brothers would use their phone or tablet to show the videos.

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:40.920
Some brothers would try to bring a TV to the Kingdom Hall. But even then, having electricity was a problem.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:53.390
I remember that there was a circuit that wanted to buy video equipment so that the circuit over here would be able to show the videos from the organisation as he visited.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:00.780
But the circuit only had six dollars.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:08.780
When we visit a congregation, we notice that brothers haven't been watching the videos for more than five months.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.780
That makes us feel bad because they have not benefited spiritually, like the other congregations.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.780
And from their expressions, they really want to benefit from these teaching videos.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.419
But there is nothing they can do.

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:31.419
Also, because of poverty, there is a lot of theft.

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:41.419
Sometimes a congregation had its little TV, but well, people would go to steal it and that creates more difficulty for the congregation.

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:46.419
War creates another challenge because at any moment, people have to move.

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:51.419
So, if you have a television, can you flee with it? It's truly very, very difficult.

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:55.419
All of this makes it really challenging for the brothers to have video equipment.

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:59.419
We have amazing growth in Angola.

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:03.419
We are forming about one circuit per month.

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:11.419
We are about 160,000 publishers and had almost 700,000 attending the memorial.

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:18.419
The needs of providing appropriate environments for teaching are obviously enormous.

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:31.560
RDC Africa and Global Purchasing started collaborating and researching what sort of projector option would work for the varied needs in Africa.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:46.560
This research included getting feedback from several branches as to whether the options were easy to use, easy to maintain, and could withstand some of the harsh environments that we have on the continent.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.560
What is really great about this kit is its size as well as its durability.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:02.560
This kit is something that's easy to pack away and even be taken away from the kingdom hall and possibly stored at the house of a responsible brother.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:12.560
As well, it's provided with two batteries, which is very useful in the majority of Africa where electricity is not always provided.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.560
The use of video has become a regular feature of our spiritual programs.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:26.560
These videos help us to see our grand instructor in ways that simply were not possible before.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:34.560
Demonstrations, artwork, experiences, and reports are just some of the ways videos teach.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.560
And for our deaf brothers and sisters, videos have become absolutely essential.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.560
In some ways, the video system at the kingdom hall is their sound system.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:53.560
With this in mind, the governing body would like everyone to benefit if possible from this new form of teaching.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:09.560
In 2019 alone, over 2,000 kingdom halls in Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malawi, and Zambia will have received the needed equipment and the training on how to use it.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:17.560
The training we've just received on how to use the video kit helps us to know how to make better use of it.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.560
So that when the brothers come to meetings, they watch videos without difficulties.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.560
We are very grateful to your brothers for supporting Jehovah's organization with your contributions.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:36.560
And we are grateful to the faithful and discreet slave for making provisions for congregations to be taught as Jehovah wants.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.560
In Congo, there was a tribal war north of Kinshasa.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:48.560
They abandoned other things they had, but they chose to run away with their video kit.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.560
It's small, it's practical, and it's well protected.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.560
They traveled with it through water in Daghart, Kanoos.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:06.500
The projector is very important for the deaf, because we hear and learn with our eyes.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.500
And that is how we come to know Jehovah and draw close to him.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:21.500
The need we have is to have effective equipment that can help the brothers to see the videos produced by the faithful and discreet slave to strengthen our faith.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.500
What fine results this initiative has produced?

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:39.500
The generous spirit of God's people is being blessed by Jehovah and makes it possible for all of our brothers and sisters to enjoy the same spiritual food worldwide.
