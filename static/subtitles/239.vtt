WEBVTT

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.350
Do you know one of the reasons why we have the hope of everlasting life in a paradise earth?

00:00:16.989 --> 00:00:28.879
A young boy who trusted in God was a key to our hope

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:44.130
His name was David. He was a shepherd in ancient Bible times

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:48.969
He had to be brave and courageous in order to protect his sheep

00:00:49.890 --> 00:01:40.420
Once David had to fight with the wild bear even though he was only a lad

00:01:41.420 --> 00:02:00.980
He always trusted in God about 1,000 years before Christ

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:04.099
During the reign of King Saul

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:06.819
Village life was very simple

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.009
However, Saul was disobedient to God and lacked faith

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.889
Jehovah God could no longer trust him

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:25.740
Therefore, he sent his prophet Samuel to choose a better king

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:29.419
This was a dangerous assignment

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.370
Why was that? If Saul found out, he would kill Samuel

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.330
Jehovah told Samuel to take along a cow

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.449
so that it would look as if he were visiting just to offer a sacrifice

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.370
This would conceal from Saul the real reason for his visit

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:02.610
Samuel finally arrived at Jesse's house in Bethlehem

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.639
Now Jesse had 8 sons

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:26.719
When Samuel saw the eldest son Eliab who was tall and impressive, he thought, surely this is the one I should choose

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.560
But Jehovah warned Samuel, do not be fooled by appearances

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:36.000
I see the real man on the inside

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.020
Samuel went looking at 6 more of Jesse's sons

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.300
But Jehovah did not choose a binadab

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:48.259
Nor Shama, nor any of the others

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.870
Well, ask Samuel, are these all the boys?

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.629
Jesse said that there was only the youngest son, David, who was out caring for the sheep

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.430
Bring him in, Samuel said

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.069
Would Jehovah really choose him?

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.709
His brothers did not think so

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.350
When David walked in, Samuel saw a handsome youth who had beautiful eyes

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.350
But was still a mere boy

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:50.259
To everyone's surprise, Jehovah said to Samuel, this is the one who will put his trust in me

00:04:51.699 --> 00:05:02.420
Annoyed him to be the next king from then on, Jehovah's spirit was with David

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:25.300
Meanwhile, in the King's palace, the servants were trying to please irritable King Saul

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.040
Wicked King Saul realized that God had rejected him

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.560
This made him have terrifying moods

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.420
His servants walked in fear and dread of him

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:54.899
What could be done to make Saul feel better?

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.420
He needed something to calm his nerves

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:03.379
A court official recommended soothing music played on a harp

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.339
A skilled harpist was called

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.459
Who did it turn out to be?

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.500
None other than David

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:19.660
Saul came to love David because his music made him feel better

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.420
Eventually, Saul went to war against the Philistines

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.100
Long time enemies of Israel who hated Jehovah God

00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:37.100
The Israelite army camped in the valley of Ilah

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:40.699
They lined up for battle on a mountain on one side

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.300
While the Philistines defiantly waited on the other side

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:54.449
The Philistines sent their champion warrior to challenge or taunt Israel

00:06:55.009 --> 00:07:00.430
He was a fearsome giant

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:02.829
Over nine feet tall

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.910
His name was Goliath

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.139
For 40 days morning and evening Goliath shouted out

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.579
I taunt the battle lines of Israel

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:21.550
Give me a man and let us fight

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:25.230
Saul and his troops were scared

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.879
Nobody wanted to face Goliath

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.629
David had brought food to his brothers at the battlefront

00:07:37.629 --> 00:07:40.750
He was shocked that no one would face this evil giant

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:43.069
Who was insulting God

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.959
But what could young David do?

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.800
He boldly offered to fight Goliath

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:56.189
Saul heard about young David's offer

00:07:57.149 --> 00:07:58.110
And called him in

00:08:01.939 --> 00:08:03.620
Putting his trusting God

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:04.420
David said

00:08:04.899 --> 00:08:05.699
Don't be afraid

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.939
I will fight this Philistine

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.259
Saul exclaimed

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.139
You're too young to face this veteran warrior

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:16.769
David said

00:08:17.329 --> 00:08:19.089
God has protected me in the past

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.889
He will save me now from this Philistine

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:26.350
Goliath must die

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:30.189
For he has taunted the living God Jehovah

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.820
So what did David use as weapons?

00:08:36.779 --> 00:08:37.899
His shepherd's staff

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.620
Five smooth stones

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.259
And his trusty sling

00:08:43.259 --> 00:08:43.899
That is all

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.500
The giant could hardly believe his eyes

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:57.299
Who was this boy coming out to face him

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.340
Am I a dog?

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.340
Did you come to me with this staff?

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.019
Just come over here

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.379
And I'll feed you to the birds and the beasts

00:09:08.179 --> 00:09:10.019
David answered

00:09:10.659 --> 00:09:14.259
You are coming to me with a sword, a spear, and a javelin

00:09:15.059 --> 00:09:18.500
I am coming to you with a name of Jehovah

00:09:18.899 --> 00:09:57.169
The Philistines panicked and fled

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:01.649
The God of Israel had triumphed

00:10:01.649 --> 00:10:04.289
At the hand of a mere shepherd boy

00:10:10.529 --> 00:10:13.889
Jonathan Saul's son had heard about the battle

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.820
He was impressed by David's victory over Goliath

00:10:20.779 --> 00:10:23.580
Instead of being jealous, he admired him

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.600
They became the very best of friends

00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:36.000
Jonathan promised to support David to the end

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.860
Sometime after David defeated Goliath

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.059
Saul put David in charge of the men of war

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.330
As time went on

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.970
David proved that he was a better soldier than Saul

00:10:59.409 --> 00:11:03.090
Women flocked to see Saul and David when they came back from battle

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:07.409
They greeted them with song and dance

00:11:07.409 --> 00:11:08.210
Crying out

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:11.570
Saul has struck down his thousands

00:11:12.289 --> 00:11:14.769
And David, his tens of thousands

00:11:16.289 --> 00:11:18.850
Saul was furious at such a comparison

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:21.730
He got jealous and angry

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:25.340
And began to turn against David

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:26.539
He did not trust him

00:11:28.139 --> 00:11:31.659
So Saul began to scheme to have David killed

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.620
Saul had a beautiful daughter called Michael

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.259
Although Saul did not know it

00:11:59.379 --> 00:12:02.690
She was in love with David

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:05.730
Saul servants realized that she wanted to marry him

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.240
When Saul found out about Michael's affection for David

00:12:13.919 --> 00:12:16.639
He had last saw his chance to do away with him

00:12:18.159 --> 00:12:19.840
Through his servants

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.440
Saul made David an offer

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.929
He would let David marry Michael

00:12:27.009 --> 00:12:30.129
If he would kill 100 Philistines

00:12:32.049 --> 00:12:35.570
Saul hoped that the Philistines would kill David instead

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.090
David took up the challenge

00:12:39.889 --> 00:12:42.129
And with his few men he went out

00:12:42.769 --> 00:12:46.850
And killed not 100 but 200 of the Philistines

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:50.129
Saul's trick failed

00:12:50.769 --> 00:12:53.009
And he was forced to give Michael to David

00:12:55.759 --> 00:12:58.320
It was clear that Jehovah was supporting David

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.159
This made Saul very afraid

00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:07.919
From now on he would be David's worst enemy

00:13:12.059 --> 00:13:16.379
However, Saul still needed David's soothing music

00:13:18.299 --> 00:13:19.340
But not for long

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.379
Saul's hatred became very clear

00:13:44.419 --> 00:13:46.019
David fled to his home

00:13:53.279 --> 00:13:54.320
Michael warned him

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.559
If you don't run away tonight

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.159
Tomorrow you'll be dead

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:13.870
David and his small band of men

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.029
Headed for the wilderness to hide

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.340
Saul and his army went after David

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:35.620
David was forced to flee deeper and deeper into the wilderness

00:14:37.059 --> 00:14:39.539
What unknown dangers lay ahead

00:14:47.389 --> 00:14:48.909
Saul looked everywhere

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:51.549
But he couldn't find David

00:14:56.899 --> 00:14:58.899
But he was determined to destroy him

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.820
Jonathan risking everything

00:15:29.379 --> 00:15:30.659
Went searching for David

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:37.970
He hoped to encourage him

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:44.669
Finding him was no easy task

00:15:45.230 --> 00:16:09.500
Jonathan assured David

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:10.620
Don't be afraid

00:16:11.259 --> 00:16:12.620
My father won't find you

00:16:13.419 --> 00:16:15.259
You will be king over Israel

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.019
And I will be second to you

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.500
They promised to be loyal to each other

00:16:20.539 --> 00:16:21.340
However

00:16:21.659 --> 00:16:24.379
This was the last time that they would be together

00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:33.149
In time

00:16:33.629 --> 00:16:35.950
Saul found out where David was hiding

00:16:38.299 --> 00:16:40.220
With 3,000 of his best men

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.379
He closed in on David

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:55.809
However

00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:03.950
David spies told him where Saul was camped

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:04.829
So David

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:07.549
Crept up on him at night

00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:09.549
With his bold nephew Abishai

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:19.789
All the guards had fallen asleep

00:17:32.609 --> 00:17:35.890
David found Saul sleeping soundly in the middle of the camp

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:40.609
Abishai eager to kill Saul

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:42.450
Whisper to David

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:45.250
Let me please pin him to the earth with the spear

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:46.769
Once will be enough

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:48.769
David said

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:50.049
No

00:17:50.049 --> 00:17:52.769
I would never think of harming Jehovah's anointed king

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:54.769
Instead

00:17:54.849 --> 00:17:57.009
Let's take his spear and water jug

00:17:57.009 --> 00:17:58.369
And then get out of here

00:18:16.509 --> 00:18:18.109
From the nearby mountain top

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:21.869
David called out to the chief of Saul's bodyguard

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:25.150
Why didn't you watch over your lord the king

00:18:26.349 --> 00:18:27.630
Someone could have killed him

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:29.470
Look

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:31.630
I have the king's spear and water jug

00:18:36.819 --> 00:18:37.859
Then he said to Saul

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.220
I could have killed you but I didn't

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.220
I trust Jehovah to respect my life

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:46.980
And protect me from all my enemies

00:18:53.019 --> 00:18:53.740
Saul replied

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:55.980
You will be blessed David

00:18:57.099 --> 00:18:57.980
Without a doubt

00:18:58.619 --> 00:18:59.819
You will be the winner

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:03.440
With that

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:04.960
David left

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.519
And Saul returned home

00:19:17.569 --> 00:19:20.369
The Israelites continued their war with the Philistines

00:19:21.089 --> 00:19:23.650
But this time things did not go well

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:26.940
At Mount Gilbauer

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.579
The Philistines closed in on Saul

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:33.180
They killed three of his sons

00:19:35.619 --> 00:19:37.059
Among these was Jonathan

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:39.539
David's most trusted friend

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:45.900
Then the archers found Saul

00:19:46.539 --> 00:19:48.220
He fell severely wounded

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.799
Rather than be executed by his enemies

00:19:53.839 --> 00:19:55.440
He fell upon his own sword

00:19:59.059 --> 00:20:00.099
And killed himself

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.079
David who had been loyal to Jehovah's king

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.480
Was so heartbroken

00:20:09.119 --> 00:20:11.039
That he ripped apart his clothing

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.119
He and his men

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.640
Begin to reap

00:20:15.359 --> 00:20:16.960
Whale and fast

00:20:20.299 --> 00:20:22.619
He also composed a funeral song

00:20:24.059 --> 00:20:26.059
I am deeply distressed

00:20:27.259 --> 00:20:29.660
Saul and Jonathan have died together

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:32.299
My brother Jonathan

00:20:33.099 --> 00:20:33.900
You

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:37.099
You were my closest and most trusted friend

00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:46.829
Years later God's promise came true

00:20:46.829 --> 00:20:48.029
When David

00:20:48.029 --> 00:20:50.029
Who had trusted in Jehovah

00:20:50.269 --> 00:20:52.670
Was crowned as king over all Israel

00:20:55.089 --> 00:20:58.130
David later built his palace in Jerusalem

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:01.009
Which came to be called the city of David

00:21:01.569 --> 00:21:03.890
He loved Jehovah's worship so much

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:06.849
That he had the ark of the covenant brought to Jerusalem

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:09.680
The ark

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.200
Was a sacred chest

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.319
Covered in gold

00:21:12.319 --> 00:21:14.160
And used in worship of Jehovah

00:21:15.119 --> 00:21:17.279
It had been kept outside the city

00:21:20.019 --> 00:21:21.059
Eventually

00:21:21.059 --> 00:21:23.940
After checking Jehovah's instructions carefully

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:28.180
The Levite priests carried the covered ark on their shoulders with rods

00:21:33.579 --> 00:21:35.900
With music and rejoicing

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.619
They brought the ark to a tent in Jerusalem

00:21:43.549 --> 00:21:47.789
It was a great and happy day for David and for Israel

00:21:50.539 --> 00:21:51.900
Skipping about

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.660
David was filled with joy

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:59.380
Jehovah's worship was being given first place

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:12.539
David was happy and secure in his royal palace

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:17.660
But he realized that the ark of the true God was in a simple tent

00:22:22.799 --> 00:22:25.920
David wanted to build a beautiful temple for Jehovah

00:22:27.119 --> 00:22:28.400
Would Jehovah allow that?

00:22:30.079 --> 00:22:34.400
Nathan the prophet was sent by Jehovah to tell David his decision

00:22:39.099 --> 00:22:41.259
However, to David's surprise

00:22:42.059 --> 00:22:44.140
Nathan told him that as a man of war

00:22:44.779 --> 00:22:46.779
He would not build the temple

00:22:48.059 --> 00:22:50.380
That privilege would go to a future son

00:22:55.519 --> 00:22:58.240
David was clearly disappointed

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:02.940
Jehovah made a new promise to David

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:06.700
Namely that the kingship would not be removed from his family

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:12.460
Eventually one of his descendants would rule forever over all the earth

00:23:14.299 --> 00:23:18.220
That one would be the best king the world had ever known

00:23:24.019 --> 00:23:25.220
However

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:29.619
Sometime later David entered into perhaps the saddest part of his life

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:33.740
He was a good king

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.980
But he also made serious mistakes

00:23:37.339 --> 00:23:40.700
He watched Bathsheba another man's wife bathing

00:23:41.579 --> 00:23:43.579
He desired her

00:23:44.299 --> 00:23:47.339
Send for her and took her to his bed

00:23:48.299 --> 00:23:51.819
Then he had Bathsheba's husband killed in battle

00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:01.710
Jehovah sent Nathan to David to tell him how badly he had sinned

00:24:03.549 --> 00:24:07.309
Because of the kingdom promise he would not lose his life

00:24:08.109 --> 00:24:10.750
But Jehovah would punish him severely

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:16.849
David showed that he was very sorry for what he had done

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:22.460
With tears he wrote in Psalm 51

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.960
Show me favor of God

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.799
According to your loving kindness

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:35.390
Against you I have sinned and what is bad in your eyes I have done

00:24:40.109 --> 00:24:43.869
Jehovah forgave David for his serious sins

00:24:54.619 --> 00:24:58.299
Overall David proved to be a good and faithful king

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:04.180
His rule brought peace and prosperity to the land of Israel

00:25:14.769 --> 00:25:16.769
Toward the end of his life

00:25:16.849 --> 00:25:19.170
David reminded his son Solomon

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:21.250
Who was to be the next king

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:23.490
Of the valuable lessons he had learned in life

00:25:26.339 --> 00:25:30.900
Trust in Jehovah even when the challenges seem too great to overcome

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.319
Be strong and trust in Jehovah

00:25:38.319 --> 00:25:41.440
Even if you have to wait for God's promises to be fulfilled

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:48.529
Walk in God's ways and admit your mistakes

00:25:52.859 --> 00:25:56.460
Never stop serving the true God and trusting in him

00:26:05.329 --> 00:26:08.769
Remember that the everlasting kingdom that Jehovah has promised

00:26:09.329 --> 00:26:11.490
Will come through our family line

00:26:15.329 --> 00:26:18.609
God's kingdom promised to David started to come true

00:26:18.609 --> 00:26:20.930
When Solomon became the next king of Israel

00:26:25.119 --> 00:26:30.319
This promise eventually led to the anointing of Jesus Christ as king

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:50.220
Jesus now ruling from the heavens is the rightful ruler over all the earth

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:54.940
He will reign over a global paradise

00:26:55.579 --> 00:27:17.019
The Christ's rule

00:27:17.019 --> 00:27:19.339
David and Jonathan will be resurrected

00:27:20.779 --> 00:27:37.490
They will meet again you want to be blessed like David

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:40.690
Keep on serving Jehovah faithful

00:27:44.559 --> 00:27:51.200
Then you will receive everlasting life with David and Jonathan in God's new world

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:04.349
Two will be rewarded for your trust in God
