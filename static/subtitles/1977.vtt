00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:08.210
An introduction to 2 John.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:15.210
John wrote his second letter along with his other two letters about 98 CE.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.210
At the time he was likely in or near Ephesus and he may have been up to 100 years of age.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.350
John introduces his letter with the words,

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.350
the older man to the chosen lady and to her children.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:39.350
Some think that the chosen lady may have been a Christian congregation or a spiritual sister named Curia,

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.350
which is Greek for lady.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.350
Many points in John's second letter summarize thoughts from his first letter.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.350
For example, John again mentions the need for Christ's followers to love one another.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.350
He also states,

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.349
this is what love means that we go on walking according to God's commandments.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:11.349
The Apostle then warns that many deceivers have gone out into the world.

00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:16.349
These anti-Christs claim that the Christ did not come in the flesh.

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:21.420
Did you know?

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.420
At 2 John 10 and 11,

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.420
John adds to the instruction in his first letter concerning anyone who pushes ahead of Christ's teaching.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.420
John states,

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.590
do not receive him into your homes or say a greeting to him.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.590
John's second letter glows with his love for his anointed brothers.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.590
He wants them to obtain a full reward,

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.590
which includes the privilege of ruling with Christ in his kingdom.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.189
As you read 2 John,

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.189
note how the elderly Apostle expressed love for his brothers,

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:05.189
how he desired that they go on walking according to God's commandments,

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:11.189
and how those who stand firm against apostasy will have the privilege of inheriting God's kingdom.
