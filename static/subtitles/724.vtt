WEBVTT

00:00:02.319 --> 00:00:06.320
But now we're moving to a part of our program.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.320
We've truly grown to love.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.320
It's entitled The Inside Story.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.320
And, Brother Trent Lippold will be our host.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.320
So, let's give Brother Lippold our attention

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:53.070
as he presents this The Inside Story.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.070
Welcome to another edition of The Inside Story.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.070
Today, we're going to meet four guests

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.070
from three continents representing the 148th class of Gilead.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.069
We're going to hear stories of isolation,

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:07.069
a remarkable gift, and obedience.

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:11.069
In each case, we will see different faces of integrity.

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:12.069
Curious?

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:14.069
Well, let's meet our first guest then,

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:17.069
Salvador and Isabel Domingo from Angola.

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:25.769
Thank you.

00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:26.769
Salvador Gile, welcome.

00:01:26.769 --> 00:01:28.769
Thank you.

00:01:28.769 --> 00:01:30.769
Yes, again, welcome.

00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:33.769
So, you're both from Angola serving in the branch.

00:01:33.769 --> 00:01:36.769
Sister Isabel, what is your assignment in the branch?

00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:39.769
I work in translation department.

00:01:39.769 --> 00:01:43.769
I do composition for one of our vernacular language.

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:44.769
Okay, which language is it?

00:01:44.769 --> 00:01:46.769
I work with Chocue language.

00:01:46.769 --> 00:01:47.769
Chocue?

00:01:47.769 --> 00:01:48.769
Yes.

00:01:48.769 --> 00:01:49.769
All right.

00:01:49.769 --> 00:01:50.769
How do you say watchtower in Chocue?

00:01:50.769 --> 00:01:52.769
Kaposhu Agutalila.

00:01:52.769 --> 00:01:54.769
But, you know, Brother Lippold,

00:01:54.769 --> 00:01:56.769
we don't need to learn the language to do composition,

00:01:56.769 --> 00:01:58.769
because it's a technical process.

00:01:58.769 --> 00:02:01.769
Well, thank you for learning the watchtower anyway.

00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:02.769
Good.

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:04.769
And, Brother Salvador, your assignment?

00:02:04.769 --> 00:02:07.769
I work in service department, preaching the desk,

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:09.770
and also I give support to branch office.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.770
Okay, preaching needs desk in Angola.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.770
What's the preaching like in Angola?

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.770
While preaching work in Angola is wonderful,

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.770
we have been seen the fulfillment of Hegai Chapter 2 verse 7.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.770
Chahava is shaking the nation.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.770
Many people are coming to the truth.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.770
And since that people respond well to the good news,

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.770
usually we say that Sangala is a paradise for all publishers,

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.770
but especially for pioneers.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.770
Okay, so he's shaking Angola?

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:41.770
Yes.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.770
So, how many are coming in an Angola?

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.770
Well, right now we have more than 165,000 publishers,

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.770
and more than 720,000 Bible studies.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.770
720,000 Bible studies.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.770
Yes, more than.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.770
That is absolutely amazing.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.770
Isabel, the kind of growth you have in Angola,

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.770
what touches your heart about this?

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.770
What touches me most is seeing young ones come to the truth.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.770
Young ones at 7, 8, 9, 10 years old, they start starting the Bible,

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.770
they start going at the meeting,

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.770
and many of them, without their parents,

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.770
and they make progress in the truth.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.770
They start preaching with the congregation, they get baptized,

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.770
and some of them they start working as our auxiliary pioneer.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.770
So, this is something amazing to see.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.770
This really touched my heart.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:41.770
Beautiful, yeah.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.770
And Salvador, for you, when you look at the growth,

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.770
how does it affect you?

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:48.770
What touches you?

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:54.770
Seeing how Chahava has been blessing the work in our branch territory,

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:55.770
is something amazing.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:02.770
For example, I remember when I was invited for the first time to attend a meeting,

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.770
that meeting was held in a brothers' home,

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.770
and we used a bedroom as a place to help the meeting,

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.770
because we were on the ban.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.770
But sometime later, since that more people were coming,

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.769
we needed to move from that bedroom to the same house,

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.769
to the dining room.

00:04:22.769 --> 00:04:27.769
And some months later, with more people coming,

00:04:27.769 --> 00:04:29.769
a little bit more freedom,

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:33.769
we needed to move from that dining room to the courtyard,

00:04:33.769 --> 00:04:36.769
same house, the same house.

00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:39.769
And from that time on, many congregations in Angola

00:04:39.769 --> 00:04:45.769
started using courtyards of brothers' home to help meetings.

00:04:45.769 --> 00:04:48.769
But now the situation is completely different.

00:04:49.769 --> 00:04:55.769
So seeing the transition from courtyards of brothers' home

00:04:55.769 --> 00:05:01.769
to a nice kingdom hall built with the help of Chahava's organization,

00:05:01.769 --> 00:05:03.769
is something that touched my heart.

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:08.769
See how Chahava takes care of his people by means of his organization.

00:05:08.769 --> 00:05:09.769
That's beautiful.

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:13.769
So what is the situation like with kingdom halls in Angola?

00:05:13.769 --> 00:05:16.769
Well, right now we have many congregations

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:20.769
that are sharing one kingdom hall.

00:05:20.769 --> 00:05:24.769
For example, in one kingdom hall, one auditorium,

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:28.769
then 11, 13, even right now,

00:05:28.769 --> 00:05:31.769
we receive information about a kingdom hall

00:05:31.769 --> 00:05:34.769
that there is 14 congregations using.

00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:40.769
So we have a huge need of mocking the halls in Angola.

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:42.769
Would you say that's one of the biggest needs right now in Angola?

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:43.769
Yes.

00:05:43.769 --> 00:05:45.769
But many people are coming to the truth.

00:05:45.769 --> 00:05:48.769
Theocratic facilities is a big need in Angola.

00:05:48.769 --> 00:05:50.769
We need space in Bethel.

00:05:50.769 --> 00:05:52.769
We need more assembly halls.

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:57.769
We need facilities for SBE, especially kingdom halls.

00:05:57.769 --> 00:06:03.769
And we have a video that shows the big need of kingdom halls that we have in Angola.

00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:05.769
We will enjoy it to see this.

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:12.060
Okay, excellent. Let's watch it.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.060
On the southwest coast of Africa, sits Angola.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.060
Home to lush jungle hillsides,

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.060
vast desert plains,

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.060
and tropical Atlantic beaches.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:33.060
But even more beautiful is the love that the people of Angola demonstrate for Bible truths.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:40.060
The growth rate of kingdom proclaimers has vastly outpaced kingdom hall construction.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:47.060
With some kingdom halls hosting as many as 14 congregations.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:55.060
Imagine the coordination challenges this creates for the publishers and for the bodies of elders.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.060
To accommodate all the weekend meetings at Mustache Place,

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.060
some begin at 6.30 in the morning,

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.060
and they continue to be held all day long.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:09.060
For midweek meetings, some congregations will start early in the afternoon.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:15.060
Supporting these schedules could potentially jeopardize our brothers' employment.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:20.060
Therefore, they prayerfully negotiate with their employers to get off work,

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:25.060
one or two hours early on meeting days.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:30.060
The later meetings that follow can last reliant to the night.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:35.060
The elders cooperates so that everyone can get the best.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:41.060
They decide that the congregation that stays far from the kingdom hall

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:45.060
have priority to show the right time for them,

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:49.060
so that they can feel comfortable because of the distance.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.060
Once the kingdom hall is full,

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:56.060
the congregation spells outside the building forming lines of the windows.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:05.660
In all cases, all their brothers and sisters lovingly put the needs and welfare of others ahead of their own.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.660
With the building in constant use,

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:15.660
when do the congregation schedule time for maintenance and cleaning?

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:21.660
It takes careful coordination under the direction of the Kingdom Hall Maintenance Committee

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:28.939
to ensure the building stays clean, safe and very comfortable.

00:08:28.939 --> 00:08:33.940
Our brothers and sisters in Angola are a gloved disparate

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.940
and cooperate together in beautiful ways,

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:50.600
providing a witness to all unlookers that Tehoba is a God of order and peace.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.600
Thank you. I mean, that was very, very interesting.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.600
When I look at the flexibility and the cooperation of the brothers and sisters in Angola with the Kingdom Hall,

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.600
I will appreciate whatever meeting time our congregation has assigned.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:08.600
It's just so beautiful to see the spirit of preaching in Angola.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.600
Many brothers, they step over to unassigned territories

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:18.600
and others, they go to seldom work territory to help congregation with few publishers.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.600
That is why, for example, Brother Leipold, last service, E.M.,

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:28.600
we had 20 new sequels last service, E.M.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:34.600
20? Yes. This service, E.M., from September until now, we have already...

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.600
Should I hold on?

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.600
We have already 97 new congregations.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.600
97? Yes.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.600
That's almost 100 new congregations in just a few months.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.600
Yes.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:53.600
That is a tremendous, tremendous spirit, just to see the obedience of the brothers and sisters in Angola

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.600
for preaching. What a beautiful example for all of us.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.600
Well, thank you both for being here and sharing these experiences with us

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.600
and the spirit of the brothers and sisters in Angola.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.600
Thank you.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:11.570
Let's introduce our next guest, it's Brother Ho Chang from Korea.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.220
Thank you very much.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:29.220
So, where the Chang you are serving in the Korea branch, and what is your assignment?

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:35.220
I work with the legal department and last year, our branch renovated a historical museum

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:44.220
while branch, and I had a privilege to participate in the project, especially working with the integrity section

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:50.220
of the historical museum with other true brothers, and we had very encouraging experiences.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:57.220
Very nice. Integrity Korea, we think of young brothers and conscientious objection.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.220
Is that what the integrity part of the museum was about?

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:09.220
To renovate the section, brothers and sisters were invited to donate meaningful historical artifacts.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.220
So, we received a lot of valuable items from them.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:16.220
One of them was very, very special to us. What was it?

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.220
It was a photograph.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:23.220
We received from a special pioneer brother. This is the photo.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.220
Very interesting.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:30.220
Brother, what do you think? What is this picture and where it was taken?

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:36.220
Well, it obviously looks like at a military, some kind of military place.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:44.220
It looks like a young brother. He's being offered a uniform, and this is him refusing the military uniform.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:50.220
Yeah, that's right. It was in a military camp. It is not a reenactment, it is a real situation.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:57.220
Brothers in Korea forcefully were taken to the military camp for enlistment, sometimes from home,

00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.220
and sometimes even from the kingdom holds.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:05.220
And as we can see in this picture, they were forced to take arms to be soldier.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:09.220
So, this is not, he's not been brought from court or anything like that.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:13.220
He had right on the spot he has to take his stand.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.220
Yes, that's right.

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:19.220
So, you said a special pioneer sent the photograph.

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:21.220
How did he get the photo?

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:28.220
Actually, this photo was taken in 1988 by a military police investigator.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:34.220
He wanted to use this photo as an evidence to charge this brother.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:42.220
But he was so touched by his firm standing, so he kept this photo for almost 20 years.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:48.220
And in 2007, the special pioneer visited him during House to House Ministry.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:52.220
He gave this photo to him, even recalling the name of the brother.

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:56.220
And he said, please give this back to him.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:05.220
Wow. So, when you received the photograph, you and the other two brothers, when you saw it for the first time,

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.220
what did you think?

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:11.220
We all just agree that it is a gift.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:16.220
It is a special gift from Jehovah without, it is impossible.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:20.220
Just the existence of this photo is impossible.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.220
And it has been kept for almost 20 years.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.220
And then through the special pioneer, we have it.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.220
It is also impossible.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.220
Why did you feel so strongly that it's impossible?

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:34.220
We didn't take this picture.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:38.220
The investigator took it and he kept it.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:42.220
And we have it, but the timing is also very important.

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:48.220
Because it's after the two monumental decisions in highest courts,

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.220
and then all the impressive brothers were released.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:54.220
And then we now have this photo.

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:57.220
So, this was just last year in 2019.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:03.220
So, we thought Jehovah was commanding all the brothers who did their best,

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:08.220
according to their Bible-trained conscience, to keep their integrity.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:13.220
And Jehovah was saying, I still remember your integrity.

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:16.220
Thank you so much. We felt the way.

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:20.220
It's very powerful. I can feel that also.

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.220
Did you, were you able to find the brother?

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.220
Yes, we did.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:27.220
He is now serving on elder.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.220
He had three children.

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:34.220
He never expected that he can see this picture.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:37.220
He knew that he was taken.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.220
Did he know the photograph was taken?

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:40.220
Yes.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:46.220
And then he remembered the investigator because he was favorable to him.

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:50.220
And he relayed one encouraging story from him.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:56.220
The investigator, for his work, he attended convention in 1988.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.220
Our convention?

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:58.220
Yes.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.220
For his work.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.220
And then he received the book.

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.220
Do you remember the book, Revelation book?

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.220
1988.

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:06.220
Yes.

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:10.220
And he gave this book to this brother in the count.

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:16.220
Yes. And he said, maybe here you may be relaxed, maybe in prison,

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.220
more severe, just enjoy this book.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:20.220
He was unbelievable.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:21.220
Yes.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:24.220
So he missed the convention.

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.220
But he got the release.

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.220
Yes.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:28.220
That's quite a story.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:31.220
So what happened when the photo was shown?

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.220
What was the response of his children?

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.220
Yes. They were all surprised at that.

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:43.220
The eldest son, he surprised because his father was always happy and smiles.

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.220
But he was so serious in this picture.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:52.220
So he was able to understand how determined his father in order to keep his integrity.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:59.220
And the second son, he found out that his father looked very similar.

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.220
So the two looked alike.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.220
Yes.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.220
The young son and the father.

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:03.220
Yes.

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:05.220
So he found himself in this photo.

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:14.220
So all the family members was able to visualize what would be like keeping integrity.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:17.220
And it was really encouraging all of them.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:21.220
Well, I think it's really true what the young son has said, seeing himself in this picture.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:25.220
Because in many ways, it is him in this picture.

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:26.220
And it's you in this picture.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.220
And it's me in this picture.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:29.220
It's all of us.

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:35.220
When we take our stand for Jehovah, when we're loyal to him, whether it's a young person in school,

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:42.220
not saluting the flag or not participating in a false religious holiday with worldly relatives.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:49.220
Or at work, again, not participating in things, taking a stand for Jehovah.

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:58.220
So really, this is a gift for all of Jehovah's people to remind us of what it means to show our integrity and be loyal to Jehovah.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.220
Thank you very, very much for sharing this with us.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.220
Thank you very much.

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:08.059
Well, let's meet our next guest.

00:17:08.059 --> 00:17:11.059
He's from Chile, and his name is Alan Kim.

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:21.329
Thank you very much.

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:22.329
Thank you very much.

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:23.329
I just have you on the inside story.

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:25.329
Thank you very much for inviting.

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:29.329
So, Brother Kim, you're born in Chile, raised in Chile?

00:17:29.329 --> 00:17:34.329
Actually, I was born in Chile, but I was raised in Brazil.

00:17:34.329 --> 00:17:38.329
And then we moved to Chile, and my parents are Korean.

00:17:38.329 --> 00:17:39.329
Okay.

00:17:39.329 --> 00:17:43.329
Did you speak Spanish when you came back to Chile?

00:17:43.329 --> 00:17:45.329
I had to learn Spanish.

00:17:45.329 --> 00:17:46.329
Yes.

00:17:46.329 --> 00:17:48.329
When did you come back to Chile?

00:17:48.329 --> 00:17:53.329
I was about 14 years old when we moved with my family.

00:17:53.329 --> 00:17:55.329
Okay, so what was that like?

00:17:55.329 --> 00:18:01.329
14 years old, speak Portuguese, and now coming to Chile, having to learn Spanish.

00:18:01.329 --> 00:18:10.329
It wasn't easy at first, because Chile is not a country that was used to receive many foreigners.

00:18:11.329 --> 00:18:20.329
So, I just seen our family, an Asian looking family, was caught many attention in Chile.

00:18:20.329 --> 00:18:25.329
So, when we were walking in the streets, we were going to a store.

00:18:25.329 --> 00:18:32.329
Many people used to look at us, point at us, and also talk about us.

00:18:32.329 --> 00:18:34.329
We had some bad experiences also.

00:18:34.329 --> 00:18:37.329
So, as a young person, how did that make you feel?

00:18:38.329 --> 00:18:45.329
As a teenager, you know that it's not easy to receive that kind of treatment in some places.

00:18:45.329 --> 00:18:54.329
And also, added to that, you have to be acquainted with their food, it's a new place, new culture.

00:18:54.329 --> 00:19:02.329
So, you have a problem of identity, because you are one country, you have another culture,

00:19:02.329 --> 00:19:05.329
you was raised in another culture.

00:19:05.329 --> 00:19:09.329
So, it wasn't easy to find myself, my place.

00:19:09.329 --> 00:19:18.329
So, sometimes even among many people, you can feel a little bit isolated, and that you don't belong anywhere.

00:19:18.329 --> 00:19:19.329
That's interesting.

00:19:19.329 --> 00:19:24.329
Probably, on a lot of people, a lot of brothers and sisters even can relate to what you're saying,

00:19:24.329 --> 00:19:29.329
sometimes feeling that way, not sure where you fit in for various reasons.

00:19:30.329 --> 00:19:32.329
What changed for you?

00:19:32.329 --> 00:19:37.329
Yes, a big help was association with brothers and sisters.

00:19:37.329 --> 00:19:48.329
Especially, I remember, our congregation was invited to attend a special international convention in Chile in 2003.

00:19:48.329 --> 00:19:57.329
And that was a very special moment, because it was my first time in such a big event of Jehovah witnesses

00:19:57.329 --> 00:20:01.329
and seeing brothers from all around the world.

00:20:01.329 --> 00:20:06.329
No one judging you by your look or having difference.

00:20:06.329 --> 00:20:11.329
Just being there, seeing everyone happy, united.

00:20:11.329 --> 00:20:18.329
That was a very big moment for me, and I could understand, well, this is really Jehovah's organization.

00:20:18.329 --> 00:20:21.329
This is the place I should be.

00:20:21.329 --> 00:20:25.329
We have a picture here of you, this is at the international convention.

00:20:25.329 --> 00:20:31.329
That's right, that was the same year that we arrived in Chile, and it's my family attending that convention.

00:20:31.329 --> 00:20:32.329
Very nice.

00:20:32.329 --> 00:20:34.329
You've changed your hair since then.

00:20:34.329 --> 00:20:35.329
Yes.

00:20:35.329 --> 00:20:42.329
So you've found your place now in the congregation, and things really started to progress for you?

00:20:42.329 --> 00:20:50.329
Yes, as I started to progress spiritually, I could meet many brothers and sisters that was a big help for us.

00:20:51.329 --> 00:20:58.329
For example, I remember one single brother that was from our congregation, a Korean brother raised in Chile,

00:20:58.329 --> 00:21:05.329
went to MTS, and he was assigned back to our congregation with another Chilean brother,

00:21:05.329 --> 00:21:14.329
and well, just seeing their example, and later many other brothers helped us to find my place in the organization.

00:21:14.329 --> 00:21:17.329
So the congregation, was this a Spanish congregation?

00:21:17.329 --> 00:21:19.329
It was a Korean congregation.

00:21:19.329 --> 00:21:25.329
You're in a Korean congregation, and you have a Chilean Korean brother assigned to your congregation,

00:21:25.329 --> 00:21:27.329
together with a Chilean brother.

00:21:27.329 --> 00:21:28.329
Did he speak Korean?

00:21:28.329 --> 00:21:30.329
He was learning Korean when he arrived.

00:21:30.329 --> 00:21:31.329
He had to learn.

00:21:31.329 --> 00:21:38.329
So the three of you then, you made a good partnership, and really positive influence on you.

00:21:38.329 --> 00:21:39.329
That's absolutely beautiful.

00:21:39.329 --> 00:21:41.329
So you're working in the branch now in Chile?

00:21:41.329 --> 00:21:42.329
Yes.

00:21:42.329 --> 00:21:46.329
I'm working in the Chile branch in the service department,

00:21:46.329 --> 00:21:48.329
and helping the preaching needs desk.

00:21:48.329 --> 00:21:54.329
Okay, but like Salvador then, what's the preaching like in Chile?

00:21:54.329 --> 00:21:59.329
We have many places, remote areas, especially in the southern part of Chile,

00:21:59.329 --> 00:22:06.329
where territories are very big, so brothers have to, sometimes they have to travel for many hours by car,

00:22:06.329 --> 00:22:11.329
or even there are places that they can't reach by car.

00:22:11.329 --> 00:22:18.329
So the congregation have to arrange a preaching campaign that can be days,

00:22:18.329 --> 00:22:26.329
seven days walking, sleeping in tents, sometimes even washing themselves in the river,

00:22:26.329 --> 00:22:31.329
and they try to reach those places, remote places, to two or three houses.

00:22:31.329 --> 00:22:33.329
Wow, that sounds exciting.

00:22:33.329 --> 00:22:37.329
The first photograph you've brought for us, where is this?

00:22:37.329 --> 00:22:45.329
This place is called Aysen region, and this place, the brothers have to drive for many hours,

00:22:45.329 --> 00:22:50.329
just to reach a small town, or a few people that live in remote areas.

00:22:50.329 --> 00:22:52.329
Good, and the next photograph, where is this area?

00:22:52.329 --> 00:22:55.329
Well, this is a southern part of Chile.

00:22:55.329 --> 00:23:02.329
It's called Adalgarina region, and many people live there, especially people that speak Mapudongong.

00:23:02.329 --> 00:23:07.329
They also have many remote areas that brothers have to walk to reach.

00:23:07.329 --> 00:23:11.329
Okay, and the next photograph you have, I mean, that's quite a feeling.

00:23:11.329 --> 00:23:17.329
Yes, this is one of the most remote areas, in the most southern part of Chile,

00:23:17.329 --> 00:23:21.329
and also the brothers arrange to preach in those places.

00:23:21.329 --> 00:23:23.329
This is called Toro del Bainé.

00:23:23.329 --> 00:23:24.329
Very nice.

00:23:24.329 --> 00:23:30.329
But it's amazing to see the efforts that the branch is making to reach these really remote areas in Chile.

00:23:31.329 --> 00:23:36.329
Yes, brothers and sisters are working hard, even to reach a few people,

00:23:36.329 --> 00:23:39.329
so we can say that they are doing a good work.

00:23:39.329 --> 00:23:40.329
Good, yeah.

00:23:40.329 --> 00:23:44.329
Very, very remote in these places, so is that?

00:23:44.329 --> 00:23:47.329
This is in the most southern part of Chile, is that as far as you go?

00:23:47.329 --> 00:23:50.329
Actually, this is not one of the most remote areas.

00:23:50.329 --> 00:23:55.329
We have another place that are more isolated in that area.

00:23:55.329 --> 00:23:57.329
I brought a video that I want to show you.

00:23:57.329 --> 00:23:58.329
Do you want to see?

00:23:58.329 --> 00:23:59.329
Yes, please.

00:23:59.329 --> 00:24:16.210
More than 2,000 miles of open ocean, separate Easter Island from the west coast of South America.

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:23.210
Yet, even here, on this remote island with less than 8,000 inhabitants,

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:27.210
the good news of God's Kingdom is being preached.

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:32.210
And the publishers in this seemingly isolated field,

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:36.210
filled the full support of Jehovah's Organization.

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:41.210
This Kingdom Hall and translation office was built in 2016.

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:46.210
Here, five brothers and sisters work to translate spiritual food

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:51.210
into the native Polynesian language of Rapanui, ensuring that local publishers

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:57.210
receive the same spiritual food as their brothers and sisters around the world.

00:24:57.210 --> 00:25:03.829
Translation personnel receive benefit from Bethel's spiritual programs,

00:25:03.829 --> 00:25:10.829
despite being two time zones away from the branch office in Santiago, Chile.

00:25:10.829 --> 00:25:17.829
Here, in the middle of the ocean, I feel how Jehovah loves me and gives me his strength

00:25:17.829 --> 00:25:22.829
job by taking care of all of us in the island.

00:25:22.829 --> 00:25:28.829
The Chile branch also supports Kingdom publishers on Ravi San Cruzo Island.

00:25:28.829 --> 00:25:33.829
Although much closer to the mainland, just over 400 miles away,

00:25:33.829 --> 00:25:36.829
it's more challenging to reach.

00:25:36.829 --> 00:25:46.470
The journey involves flight and then a boat ride from the isolated airport

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:53.470
to the inhabited part of the island, which can only be traveled when the seas aren't too rough.

00:25:53.470 --> 00:26:03.670
But despite these challenges, our brothers and sisters receive constant and timely spiritual food,

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:09.690
LDC support and shepherding.

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:15.690
For years, Ravi San Cruzo Island was home to just five spiritual sisters.

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:22.690
With the help of the LDC, a small Kingdom Hall was remodeled and a two-room apartment was added.

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:27.690
This made it possible for two single-welders to move to the island,

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:31.690
where they now assist with preaching and shepherding.

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:34.690
Although traveling here is not for the faint of heart,

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:40.690
this congregation of eight publishers receives a visit from their sickid overseer twice a year.

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:48.690
The visit lasts for two or three weeks each time, providing extra spiritual support to these faithful ones.

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:52.690
It doesn't matter where you live.

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:56.690
If you're in the city and the countryside, even in a place like this,

00:26:56.690 --> 00:27:00.690
in the middle of the ocean, Jehovah is with us.

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:08.690
Those who preach and those who respond to the good news receive abundant spiritual care.

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:16.690
Resulting in a unified worldwide brotherhood that praises our great God, Jehovah.

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:33.450
As beautiful as I see the efforts of the branch is making to care for brothers and sisters in such remote islands.

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:37.450
And I thought it was interesting as well that, for example, in Robinson Cruzo Island,

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:43.450
the circuit overseer will stay there for two or three weeks because it is so isolated.

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:50.450
Most of the time, he spent two weeks just to encourage the brothers that are so isolated.

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:58.450
And sometimes he even spent one additional week, almost three weeks, to combine with a sickid assembly.

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:04.450
Very nice. It's a nice arrangement that the branch has to care for this particular island.

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:09.450
Yes, and there is another island that the circuit overseers from Chile are visiting,

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:12.450
and that's the Falkland Island.

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:19.450
In this year, we have an arrangement to send a circuit overseer and just to encourage the brothers and sisters.

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:24.450
That's amazing, very nice. I mean, brothers and Chile, you're not afraid of remote places, that's for sure.

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:30.450
Yes. Actually, these places that we just saw are not the most remote areas.

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:35.450
We have one place that we also could reach a few years ago,

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:38.450
and that's the Antarctica, as you can see in the photo.

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:39.450
You're kidding me.

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:42.450
You mean the branch in Chile has supported the work in Antarctica?

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:43.450
Yes.

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:45.450
I imagine it's very difficult to get there.

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:50.450
Yes. It's very hard because first we need permission and we have to fly,

00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:55.450
so the branch have to make some arrangements to reach a couple in that area.

00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:57.450
Very nice. Well, thank you very much, Alan.

00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:01.450
Thank you for sharing this information with us and helping us to see that,

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:04.450
even though we're isolated, we're not alone.

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:07.450
You really feel Chile is your home?

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:14.450
Yes. Of course, as you can see, Chile is a beautiful place with many good brothers and sisters.

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:19.450
Also, it really doesn't matter where really are physically.

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:25.450
If we are with Jehovah and his organization, we are in the Great Spiritual Temple,

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:29.450
so we can feel whatever we are, we can feel that's our home.

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:35.740
Beautiful. Thank you very much, Alan, for showing my request.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:42.740
Integrity has been described as wholehearted love for an unbreakable devotion to the person of Jehovah,

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:46.740
so that his will comes first in all of our decisions.

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:50.740
And our guests today have shown us different faces of integrity,

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:55.740
like obedience and cooperation in preaching and meeting together,

00:29:55.740 --> 00:30:00.740
or maintaining loyalty when you come face-to-face with tests,

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:06.740
or if you feel isolated, or are literally geographically isolated,

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:10.740
you can maintain unbreakable devotion to Jehovah.

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:12.740
The Psalmist wrote,

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:17.740
If I should fly away with the wings of the dawn to reside by the most remote sea,

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:23.740
even there your hand would lead me and your right hand would take hold of me.

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:29.740
Clearly, Jehovah sees our acts of integrity and he loves us for it.

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:33.740
Please join us on another edition of the Inside Story.

00:30:33.740 --> 00:31:07.930
You would think we have about 500 here in the audience,

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:12.930
but that was again a faith-strengthening program.

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:18.930
It's amazing, some of the experiences things happening in various parts of the earth.

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:20.930
What a treat that was.
