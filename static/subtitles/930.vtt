WEBVTT

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:29.449
We are overjoyed that you are among the millions around the world who are viewing this convention.

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:39.450
An infirm Bible student named Joyce, who lives in Southeast Asia, expressed her appreciation for these arrangements by saying,

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:47.450
with the convention being streamed online, I don't have to miss a single talk.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.450
I can watch the program of the rest of the Brotherhood worldwide.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.450
I am so thankful to Jehovah for this arrangement.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.450
Perhaps you can relate to her expressions.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:09.450
Thank you for the generous donations you have made online at donate.jw.org and by other means,

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.450
which help make these streaming services possible.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:24.659
During these critical last days, many families lack the affection the Jehovah designed us to give and receive.

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:32.659
However, God's word contains principles that, when followed, lead to peace.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:40.659
Resture you will enjoy the fine talks and dramatizations in this next symposium.

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:46.659
Brother Joel Dellinger, a helper to the service committee, will deliver the first talk,

00:01:46.659 --> 00:02:00.140
follow the roadmap to family peace, show love and respect.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.140
Family peace is precious.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:13.139
It's even as the Bible proverb says, better is a piece of dry bread where there is peace than a house full of feasting along with quarreling.

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:17.139
But what exactly is family peace?

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:22.139
Someone might say, as long as we're not arguing, our families at peace.

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:25.139
But is that real peace?

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:30.139
We might think of two countries that we're fighting but have now agreed to a ceasefire.

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:35.139
Does the ceasefire mean that they've become real friends who love one another?

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:37.139
No.

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:40.139
We know that genuine peace takes more work.

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:43.139
That's true in the family as well.

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:51.139
Our Heavenly Father knows that the most satisfying family peace involves more than an absence of arguing.

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:56.139
It involves a family's well-being and unity.

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:01.139
Is such peace in a family today really possible?

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:06.139
Although none of us have a perfect family, the answer is yes.

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:16.139
While it requires work, perhaps breaking bad habits that disrupt peace and adopting new ones that promote it, those efforts are worth it.

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:29.139
In this symposium, we'll see how Bible principles can guide families to peace, just as a roadmap guides travelers to a beautiful destination.

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:43.139
In each of the talks, we invite you husbands, fathers, wives, mothers, children, teenagers to be the traveler who studies the map and then goes in the right direction.

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:49.139
The focus of our first talk is showing love and respect.

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:55.139
Why would you say these two qualities are so important to family peace?

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.139
Well, it's simple.

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:03.139
Because family members who love and respect one another feel secure and appreciated.

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:10.139
As a result, our relationships are warm, close, and peaceful.

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:14.139
Of course, showing love and respect can be a challenge these days.

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:21.180
In the following dramatization, notice why.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:27.879
Irene, you look so handsome.

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:29.879
No, you look beautiful.

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:32.879
Those came out so nice.

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:34.879
Look at you.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:44.870
Sorry, Olivia.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:45.870
Are you okay?

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:46.870
Yeah, it's okay, Sue.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.870
I'm so sorry, boys.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.870
I'm all I've done. That was the last box.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.250
Dad, are those a wedding photo?

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.250
Let me see.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.250
Look at his.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.250
Oh, you're not beautiful.

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:27.379
Olivia?

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:30.379
I know this is all new, baby.

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:31.379
Be patient.

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:41.540
Can I cut in?

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.300
Yeah, sure.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:06:07.639
Thanks.

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:08.639
What's wrong?

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.639
Where's the desk?

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:12.639
We have to get rid of it.

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:14.639
This one's better for everyone.

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:17.639
You mean it's better for him?

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:18.639
For Max?

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:20.639
What are you saying?

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:21.639
What do you care?

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:22.639
He'll talk to me like that.

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:54.620
Get back here.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.620
Hey, Olivia.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.620
What do you think about the desk?

00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:59.620
Come here, sweetie.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.620
Come here.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:12.649
So you never forget that I love you.

00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:14.649
I hope you like it.

00:07:14.649 --> 00:07:24.860
Today, every family faces challenges of some sort.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.860
So let's consult our roadmap together.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.860
In the Bible at Romans 12 and verse 10.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.860
Would you read it with me, please?

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.860
That's Romans 12 and verse 10.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:41.860
In brotherly love, have tender affection for one another.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:46.860
In showing honor to one another, take the lead.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.860
Now, what's the point?

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.860
Regardless of the role we play in the family,

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:56.860
each of us needs to treat our family members with love and respect.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:00.860
We need to take the lead or initiative to do so.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.860
To help us, let's consider four good habits

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.860
that all of us should work to develop more fully.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.860
Habit number one.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.860
Regularly express tender affection.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.860
When conveyed with sincerity, expressions of affection

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.860
are like sunshine and water to plants.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.860
They help everyone in the family grow and thrive.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.860
In the video we just watched,

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.860
did you note how Olivia cherished her father's gift?

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.860
That green desk and his tender words?

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:37.860
He told her, so you never forget that I love you.

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:41.860
We also saw warm affection as the newly blended family

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.860
of Max and Irene looked at wedding photos.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.860
That was encouraging.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.860
Well, here's a question.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:53.860
How are we doing an expressing tender affection in our family?

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.860
If that's not one of our strengths,

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.860
we might relate to a husband who mustered up the courage

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.860
to say, I love you to his wife.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.860
It brought her to tears, tears of joy,

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.860
and she said this,

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.860
I love you too,

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:13.860
but this is the first time in 25 years you've said it like that.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.860
Well, what's the point?

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.860
We don't want to wait that long, of course.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:22.860
But even an awkward attempt at expressing affection in our family

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.860
is an act of love,

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.860
and it can do so much good.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.860
That's a habit we all want to cultivate.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.860
Let's consider a second habit.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:38.860
Be kind in your actions, tone of voice, and choice of words.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:42.860
In the video, we recall Irene's reassurance to her daughter, Olivia.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.860
She said, I know this is all new, baby.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.860
Be patient.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:52.860
Mom was kind in what she said and how she said it.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.860
A little later though, Olivia was upset.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.860
While we know she was hurt,

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:01.860
her speech and actions were not so kind, were they?

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.860
During the pandemic,

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.860
all of us have been under tremendous stress,

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.860
and likely we didn't always treat others in our family

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.860
as kindly as we would have liked.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.860
Well, that's in the past.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.860
But what can we all do now?

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:22.860
We can pray to Jehovah to help us take the lead in showing kindness.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.860
For example, every day greeting one another kindly.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.860
Every day, saying, please, and thank you,

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.860
sharing little gifts, making time to talk, really listening.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.860
All of these are acts of kindness.

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:41.860
That's a good habit we all want to cultivate.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.860
What's habit number three?

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:48.860
Be quick to apologize and forgive freely.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:52.860
In the video, Olivia's new step-sister Sue apologized

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.860
after she bumped into Olivia with a box by mistake.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:59.860
That apology promoted peace.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.860
When you and I realize we've hurt someone,

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.860
even unintentionally, what should we do?

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.860
We should make amends quickly.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.860
A mother named Marina said this.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:13.860
We tried to set a good example for our children

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.860
and forgiving others and not getting offended.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.860
When I am wrong, I apologize to my children.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:25.860
I want them to learn to do the same in their dealings with others.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.860
That's a good habit, wouldn't you agree?

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.860
Well, let's consider one more, a fourth habit.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:35.860
Help your family members feel respected.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:40.860
An article in the Awake magazine once made this insightful comment.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:44.860
Respect is in the eye of the beholder.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.860
What does that mean?

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.860
Even if we think we're showing respect in the family,

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.860
a good question to ask ourselves is,

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:56.860
do my family members feel that I respect them?

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.860
Is there more I can do to help my mate, my children,

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:04.860
or my parents feel loved and respected?

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:09.860
Brothers and sisters, when we fulfill our God-given role in the family

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.860
by developing good habits such as these,

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:17.860
we show respect both for Jehovah and all of our family members.

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:21.860
Now, let's think about Olivia and her mom.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:24.860
In the next video, note how peace can be restored

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:38.840
by showing love and respect.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.840
It's okay, Mom.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:41.840
You didn't know.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.840
Dad did that for her just before he died.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:56.409
Anything I can do to help.

00:12:56.409 --> 00:12:58.409
Romans 1210.

00:12:58.409 --> 00:13:01.409
And showing honor to one another.

00:13:01.409 --> 00:13:03.409
Take the lead.

00:13:03.409 --> 00:13:17.960
Olivia, I made your favorite tonight.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:31.450
Thank you.

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:35.450
I wanted to tell you I didn't handle that so well today.

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:42.940
You had good reason to be upset about the desk.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:47.889
Mom, you didn't know.

00:13:47.889 --> 00:13:50.889
It's just one of those things that Dad did just for me.

00:13:50.889 --> 00:14:00.629
I know he's my sub-dad now, but I just wish he would have checked first.

00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:02.629
It wasn't Max.

00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:04.629
It was me.

00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:13.889
I wanted to surprise Max with a place for him to do his work.

00:14:13.889 --> 00:14:16.889
So he didn't make you get rid of the desk?

00:14:16.889 --> 00:14:21.980
No.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.980
I just thought you both didn't care.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:29.980
I will never, ever stop caring about you.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:48.059
What a beautiful outcome.

00:14:48.059 --> 00:14:52.059
The well-being and unity of the family were restored.

00:14:52.059 --> 00:14:56.059
The mom Irene applied the principal at Romans 1210.

00:14:56.059 --> 00:15:01.059
She took the lead or the initiative to talk kindly with her daughter.

00:15:01.059 --> 00:15:05.059
Though Olivia was upset, she too showed love and respect

00:15:05.059 --> 00:15:08.059
by being willing to listen to her mom.

00:15:08.059 --> 00:15:11.059
As a result, the misunderstanding was cleared up.

00:15:11.059 --> 00:15:16.059
And Irene used the opportunity to reassure her precious daughter of her love,

00:15:16.059 --> 00:15:21.059
saying, I will never, ever stop caring about you.

00:15:21.059 --> 00:15:27.059
And how our hearts were touched to see their warm embrace.

00:15:27.059 --> 00:15:31.059
When we take the lead in applying Bible principles,

00:15:31.059 --> 00:15:35.059
we promote genuine family peace.

00:15:35.059 --> 00:15:39.059
So may all of us be determined to keep showing our family

00:15:39.059 --> 00:15:45.059
that we truly love and respect them in word and action.

00:15:45.059 --> 00:15:48.059
Now, please listen as Brother Robert Lucioni,

00:15:48.059 --> 00:15:50.059
a helper to the publishing committee,

00:15:50.059 --> 00:15:53.059
considers the next talk of this symposium.

00:15:53.059 --> 00:15:59.059
With the theme, follow the road map to family peace, improve communication.

00:15:59.059 --> 00:16:12.830
Our previous talk reminded us that it's possible for a family to enjoy peace.

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:14.830
But it takes work.

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:19.830
Let's look at one more step that can help us stay on the road to peace.

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:21.830
And that is good communication.

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:26.830
A family promotes peace when all the family members communicate

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:30.830
in an open, calm, and honest manner.

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:34.830
But how does communication help with peace?

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:38.830
Well, a pattern of good communication keeps the family close.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.830
It helps us to identify and address problems

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:45.830
before these reach a point that they take peace away.

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:47.830
Now, that may seem obvious.

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:52.830
But isn't it true that we may find that between work and school,

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:56.830
the meetings and ministry and recreation and just life in general

00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:00.830
that is hard to find time to communicate as a family?

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:03.830
Is that a challenge in your family?

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:07.829
When the following dramatization notice what habits

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:19.309
hinder family communication?

00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:20.309
Hey Steve.

00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:25.390
Yeah, I'm sorry I was late to the meeting.

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:30.990
I should have been there to help out with my assignment.

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:31.990
Yeah, we got delayed.

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:38.410
We're late.

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:46.460
Let's go, kids.

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.460
Yeah, family's fine.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:55.740
Everybody's adjusting really well.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:00.339
Anyone see my glasses?

00:18:00.339 --> 00:18:01.339
Anyone?

00:18:01.339 --> 00:18:11.390
I mean, we might be a little out of sync, but I don't know.

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:18.900
Every family has their issues, right?

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:22.730
You got outside, no?

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:30.019
Hey, well thanks for understanding.

00:18:30.019 --> 00:18:31.019
Okay, take care.

00:18:31.019 --> 00:18:32.019
All right, bye-bye.

00:18:32.019 --> 00:19:07.450
Did you notice some habits that hinder family communication?

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:10.450
In the case of this family, it seems like technology

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.450
is stifling their communication.

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:15.450
And they obviously have some things they need to communicate about.

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:20.450
A punctuality, dress and grooming, but it's not happening.

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:23.450
Now, while the scenes of them all looking at their devices

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:26.450
and ignoring one another may have been a bit humorous,

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:31.450
did it remind you of your family at times?

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:35.450
What a good reminder for us not to let the use of technology

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:39.450
rob our family of our time and attention.

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:45.450
So how can we develop habits that promote good communication?

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:49.450
Let's consider the second Bible principle of this symposium.

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:50.450
Let's turn together.

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:55.450
Please do Ephesians chapter 5 and let's read verses 15 and 16.

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:59.450
Ephesians 5, 15 and 16.

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:04.450
So keep strict watch that how you walk is not as unwise

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:08.450
but as wise persons, making the best use of your time

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:11.450
because the days are wicked.

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:15.450
Now let's look at two ways that this Bible principle can help us.

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:20.450
The first is by making time to have meaningful communication.

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:23.450
Did you notice there in verse 16?

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:27.450
It says making the best use of your time.

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:32.450
Now the study note for this phrase indicates the need to buy out the time

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:35.450
for important things from other pursuits.

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:39.450
So how can this apply to family communication?

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:43.450
Well, this could include having a plan or a routine

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:47.450
for when we spend time together as a family each day.

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:51.450
And during those times we may choose to limit our use of technology

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:54.450
so it does not interfere with communication.

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:59.450
Perhaps it's in the evening or at a specific meal time.

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:02.450
One brother named Aaron stated,

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:06.450
we have our evening meal together which allows us time to talk

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:09.450
and hear what's important to each member of the family.

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:12.450
He says my wife and I have arranged our schedules

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:15.450
so we take the boys to school and pick them up.

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:18.450
This allows us to spend more time with them.

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:21.450
Then he says, my wife and I regularly take walks

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:24.450
and freely talk about our concern.

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:26.450
What's the point?

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:29.450
Well, they're making good use of their time.

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:33.450
However, to do this they had to buy that time out from other pursuits.

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:36.450
But they have a plan, they have a routine.

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:42.450
So what plan or routine does your family have

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:45.450
for meaningful communication each day?

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:49.450
If you don't have one, can you start now?

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:53.450
Let's look at the second way that this Bible principle can help us.

00:21:53.450 --> 00:22:00.450
And that is by determining when and how to deal with problems when they do arise.

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:07.450
You notice verse 15 in Ephesians chapter 5 says that we should walk as wise persons.

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:10.450
That means we need to choose our paths carefully.

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:15.450
Knowing when to go, when to stop, when to take another route.

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:19.450
Well, how can that help us when problems arise?

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:27.450
Well, a wise person generally knows when is and when is not a good time to address a problem.

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:32.450
For example, we all can attest that when emotions are high,

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:36.450
it's probably not the best time to bring up an issue.

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:42.450
One father states, sometimes we need to wait and let things cool.

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:49.450
Often the nights rest with prayer make a big difference when we address the issue the next morning.

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:51.450
That's a wise person.

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:54.450
A wise person also listens.

00:22:54.450 --> 00:23:02.450
James chapter 1 verse 19 reminds us to be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to anger.

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:10.450
So thus we can go to Jehovah and prayer and ask him to help us to really listen, to stay calm, to stay humble.

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:13.450
One sister named Don states,

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:21.450
when there are problems, the first thing I do is ask Jehovah and prayer to help us resolve the problem calmly.

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:29.450
Then she says, then we talk with the family member privately and really try to listen to their side of the issue.

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:32.450
That's a wise person.

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:38.450
A wise person will also consider the approach and the words that he or she uses.

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:46.450
For example, rather than telling our family member that they have a problem, can we turn it around that it's something that we all need to work on together?

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:55.450
Do you reassure your family members that you really love them and you want to understand their side of the issue or the problem?

00:23:56.450 --> 00:24:03.450
Now doing this, we're not attacking the family member, but rather showing that we're all in this together.

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:09.450
So we see benefits of this Bible principle in communication in our family, don't we?

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:11.450
You notice the two points.

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:18.450
Number one, making the best use of our time and number two, walking as wise persons.

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:24.450
Now communication will always be a work in progress, but it's worth the effort.

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:28.450
As it'll go a long way to bringing peace to your family.

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:37.450
Let's watch more of our dramatization and notice the benefits of developing habits that promote good communication.

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:45.029
I don't know. What do you think?

00:24:45.029 --> 00:24:48.029
We all have to work on it. I know I need to.

00:24:48.029 --> 00:24:53.029
Why don't we approach it that way with the kids? Just be open with them.

00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:55.029
That sounds like a good idea.

00:24:56.029 --> 00:25:05.410
Okay, so Irene and I have been talking about communication in our family.

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:09.410
We want to talk about our phones and other devices.

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:11.410
You're not talking about me, are you?

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:16.410
You can't do that. I know that we can all be more balanced, but you can't take them away.

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:19.410
I haven't done anything bad. I have responsibilities.

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:21.410
Hold on. You're always on your phone too.

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:22.410
That's true.

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:25.410
Let's just talk about it.

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:36.950
All right, so can you read Ephesians 5, 15, and 16 for us, please?

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:47.950
So keep strict watch that how you walk is not as unwise, but as wise persons, making the best use of your time, because the days are wicked.

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:55.329
So how do you think we're doing with our phones and other devices?

00:25:55.329 --> 00:26:05.720
It isn't that what you're doing on your devices is wrong.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:13.720
Exactly, but could it be taking time away from more important things, like talking to each other?

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:20.349
And in that way affecting even how we're talking to each other?

00:26:20.349 --> 00:26:31.039
Yeah, I think it'd be smart to have some boundaries then.

00:26:31.039 --> 00:26:43.539
Yeah, okay. Okay.

00:26:43.539 --> 00:26:46.539
Okay? Let's talk about how we can do that.

00:26:46.539 --> 00:26:51.349
Hey.

00:26:51.349 --> 00:26:53.349
How do you love you?

00:26:53.349 --> 00:26:54.349
Hey.

00:26:54.349 --> 00:27:00.589
Evidently, I haven't figured out how to talk to her about her close yet.

00:27:00.589 --> 00:27:01.589
I need your help.

00:27:01.589 --> 00:27:03.589
I got this one.

00:27:03.589 --> 00:27:12.940
I know, but it's all about good spiritual judgment.

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:20.859
Do you think that these trends reflect Jehovah's view of respectable dress?

00:27:20.859 --> 00:27:22.859
I know that you'll do the right thing.

00:27:22.859 --> 00:27:38.299
While we're all here, I know we all have different views on punctuality.

00:27:38.299 --> 00:27:45.299
But I really need your help so I can take care of some of my responsibilities.

00:27:45.299 --> 00:27:49.019
You think we can meet in the middle?

00:27:49.019 --> 00:27:50.019
Yeah.

00:27:50.019 --> 00:27:51.019
All right.

00:27:51.019 --> 00:28:11.769
Great.

00:28:11.769 --> 00:28:18.769
Now, this symposium has been discussing four Bible principles that can guide families to peace.

00:28:18.769 --> 00:28:24.769
Now, did we see how this scripture helped our family in the video?

00:28:24.769 --> 00:28:36.769
Well, we saw that they knew down deep that they were not making the best use of their time.

00:28:36.769 --> 00:28:38.769
So they may changes.

00:28:38.769 --> 00:28:44.769
They saw that they needed to set boundaries so they could improve their communication.

00:28:44.769 --> 00:28:50.769
And we also saw how the family, the parents, acted as wise persons.

00:28:50.769 --> 00:28:51.769
How?

00:28:51.769 --> 00:28:56.769
Well, by determining when and how to address the problems that needed to be addressed,

00:28:56.769 --> 00:29:02.769
such as the use of technology, dress and grooming and punctuality.

00:29:02.769 --> 00:29:09.769
Well, can this Bible principle help your family, help my family to improve communication?

00:29:09.769 --> 00:29:15.769
Would this be a good scripture to include in your next family worship?

00:29:15.769 --> 00:29:19.769
Now, it takes time to learn how to communicate well as a family.

00:29:19.769 --> 00:29:22.769
But it is worth the effort.

00:29:22.769 --> 00:29:23.769
Why?

00:29:23.769 --> 00:29:32.769
Well, if we strive to communicate well each day, then communication will come more readily when there are problems.

00:29:33.769 --> 00:29:39.769
So be determined to look for ways to improve communication in your family.

00:29:39.769 --> 00:29:47.769
And by taking this initiative and sticking with it, you will be following the roadmap to family peace.

00:29:47.769 --> 00:29:52.769
Please listen out to Brother David Splane, a member of the governing body,

00:29:52.769 --> 00:30:00.769
as he considers the next talk of this symposium, follow the roadmap to family peace, work as a team.

00:30:00.769 --> 00:30:12.420
Jehovah intended married couples to work together.

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:17.420
That's why Jesus used the expression we find at Matthew 19 and verse 6.

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:21.420
Let's read this from the Bible.

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:31.819
Matthew 19, I'll give you a moment, Matthew chapter 19, and we're going to read verse 6.

00:30:31.819 --> 00:30:37.819
Now, first of all, Jesus quotes from Genesis 2.24.

00:30:37.819 --> 00:30:43.819
He says, speaking of varied couples, he says, so that they are no longer two, but one flesh.

00:30:43.819 --> 00:30:48.819
Now, do you remember Jehovah made that comment in the Garden of Eden?

00:30:48.819 --> 00:30:52.819
But now, Jesus adds something that isn't in Genesis.

00:30:52.819 --> 00:31:03.819
He says, therefore, what God has yoked together, let no man put apart.

00:31:04.819 --> 00:31:11.819
When we think of a yoke, we may think of a team of horses plowing a field or pulling a heavy wagon.

00:31:11.819 --> 00:31:15.819
Now, if they pull together, they can be a powerful force.

00:31:15.819 --> 00:31:21.200
The same is true when family members work together.

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:29.200
Mom, dad, you have excellent reasons to work together.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:33.200
When you work together, you contribute to the peace of the family.

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.200
And think of the effect it has on the children.

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:42.200
By working together, you are teaching that fine young son of yours how to be a caring husband and father.

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:48.200
And your beautiful daughter? How to be a supportive wife and mother?

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:54.200
But what happens when teammates begin pulling in opposite directions or when one puts on the brakes?

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:58.200
That's watch a video. Now, here's the setup.

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:05.200
For a long time, a sister raised her two children as a single parent and she did a great job of it.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:11.200
Then, she married a very kind brother. The family has a new head.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:15.200
Let's see how well the sister is adapting to her new role.

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:25.259
The last few weeks of family worship have been nice. Right?

00:32:25.259 --> 00:32:27.259
Yeah.

00:32:27.259 --> 00:32:31.259
All these things we ask in praying, Jesus' name, amen.

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:37.690
Okay, this week.

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:39.690
We are in chapter 5.

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:43.690
Yeah, that's right. And last week gave bread, so this week...

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:45.690
It's suster.

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:49.259
That's right. It's suster.

00:32:49.259 --> 00:32:52.259
Okay, the point here is that when it comes...

00:32:52.259 --> 00:32:56.259
Honey, maybe an illustration would be better.

00:32:56.259 --> 00:32:58.259
Um...

00:32:58.259 --> 00:33:00.259
Okay.

00:33:00.259 --> 00:33:02.259
It's like a bird.

00:33:02.259 --> 00:33:05.259
Well, hopefully I was able to clear that up for you a little bit of Olivia.

00:33:05.259 --> 00:33:08.259
Well, actually, Max, that's not true.

00:33:08.259 --> 00:33:11.259
We had an updated understanding in the recent watchtower.

00:33:11.259 --> 00:33:15.049
Thanks.

00:33:15.049 --> 00:33:22.529
I think they went really well.

00:33:22.529 --> 00:33:24.529
Right?

00:33:24.529 --> 00:33:26.529
Um...

00:33:26.529 --> 00:33:28.529
Actually.

00:33:28.529 --> 00:33:32.089
Hey.

00:33:32.089 --> 00:33:36.549
Maybe we can talk about it later.

00:33:36.549 --> 00:33:38.960
Okay.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:56.299
The sister isn't a bad person.

00:33:56.299 --> 00:34:01.299
But we can ask, what's she teaching her daughter about the wife's role in the family?

00:34:01.299 --> 00:34:06.299
And what's your son learning about taking the lead as the man of the house?

00:34:06.299 --> 00:34:09.300
He hasn't had a man in his life for a long time.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.300
No, there is one.

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:16.300
It's safe to say that the kids will stand a better chance of having a successful marriage themselves

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:20.300
when they see their parents pulling together.

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:24.300
A little later, we'll see how the husband handles the situation.

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:27.300
And we, brothers, are going to want to pay attention.

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:31.739
This is a classic.

00:34:31.739 --> 00:34:38.739
Family life is more pleasant when dad, mom, and the kids work together as a team.

00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:40.739
The family head is the captain.

00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:44.739
He needs to make sure that everyone knows what goal is the family's working toward,

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:49.739
and how each one can contribute toward achieving those goals.

00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:52.739
When as your family is turned to help clean the kingdom hall,

00:34:52.739 --> 00:34:56.739
or a convention venue, for example, don't leave the kids at home.

00:34:56.739 --> 00:34:58.739
They're part of the team.

00:34:58.739 --> 00:35:00.739
Don't go there with half the team.

00:35:00.739 --> 00:35:04.739
Let them experience the joy that comes from serving others.

00:35:04.739 --> 00:35:07.739
Let them work along with you.

00:35:07.739 --> 00:35:10.739
If you're assigned to clean the restrooms, don't complain about it.

00:35:10.739 --> 00:35:12.739
A very fine example.

00:35:12.739 --> 00:35:16.739
Your children will learn that on this work to be done, we just do it.

00:35:16.739 --> 00:35:21.739
We aren't picky about what we will and will not do.

00:35:21.739 --> 00:35:25.739
And we don't feel that some jobs are beneath us.

00:35:25.739 --> 00:35:32.739
Now this is in line with Paul's counsel, found at Philippians chapter 2, verses 3 and 4.

00:35:32.739 --> 00:35:35.739
Let's look that up.

00:35:35.739 --> 00:35:37.739
Let's go to exercise.

00:35:37.739 --> 00:35:44.739
Philippians chapter 2, verses 3 and 4.

00:35:44.739 --> 00:35:47.739
Now we're thinking about the family as a team here.

00:35:47.739 --> 00:35:53.739
It says, do nothing out of contentiousness or out of egotism,

00:35:53.739 --> 00:35:58.739
but with humility, consider others superior to you,

00:35:58.739 --> 00:36:02.739
as you will look out not only for your own interests,

00:36:02.739 --> 00:36:06.739
but also for the interests of others.

00:36:06.739 --> 00:36:09.739
When there's work to be done, someone has to do it.

00:36:09.739 --> 00:36:15.739
Do I think that I'm so special that someone else has to look after it?

00:36:15.739 --> 00:36:19.739
Some families volunteer to help with kingdom hall maintenance.

00:36:19.739 --> 00:36:24.739
When the kids are old enough, they can work on other projects like working on an assembly hall.

00:36:24.739 --> 00:36:26.739
They have a ball.

00:36:26.739 --> 00:36:31.739
The friendships that you and your young people will forge can last a lifetime.

00:36:31.739 --> 00:36:33.739
And here's a bonus.

00:36:33.739 --> 00:36:36.739
When the young people go to a circuit assembly or a regional convention,

00:36:36.739 --> 00:36:41.739
they'll have good friends to associate with, both young and old.

00:36:41.739 --> 00:36:46.340
People they've been working with.

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:49.340
What about working around the house?

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:53.340
Some parents feel that the children shouldn't have to help out at all

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:56.340
because they have their schoolwork to do.

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:59.340
But their schoolwork is something they do for themselves.

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:02.340
How are they contributing to the welfare of the family?

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:06.340
How are they learning to serve others unselfishly?

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:10.340
It's good for a child to feel that he has an important role in the household

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:13.340
and that people are counting on him.

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:17.340
Think what that does for his self-respect.

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:19.340
A father named Stephen said,

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:24.340
when nothing is expected of them, children learn that they're here to be served

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:31.340
and they grow up with a distorted view of what life will require of them.

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:38.340
We might ask, will a young person with that attitude even be able to keep a job?

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:43.340
When some in the world lose their job, they remain unemployed for a long time.

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:45.340
They can't pay the bills.

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:49.340
Yet there are job opportunities all around them.

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:52.340
But they consider those jobs beneath them.

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:56.340
And what's one of the most annoying traits an employee can have?

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:58.340
Ask any boss.

00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:01.340
When the worker is asked to do something, he replies,

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:04.340
that's not my job.

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:09.340
Teach your child that anything that needs to be done is his job

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:14.579
if he's old enough and capable of doing it.

00:38:14.579 --> 00:38:18.579
How early should parents start to assign chores to their children?

00:38:18.579 --> 00:38:23.579
Some experts have found that children who are three years old

00:38:23.579 --> 00:38:27.579
or even younger can be taught to help out.

00:38:27.579 --> 00:38:31.579
They can learn to pick up their toys, clean up spills, sort laundry.

00:38:31.579 --> 00:38:36.579
Older children can vacuum, wash the car, prepare a meal.

00:38:36.579 --> 00:38:41.579
I'm happy to say that many young brothers here at Bethel are excellent cooks,

00:38:41.579 --> 00:38:46.579
which is often the result of fine parental training.

00:38:46.579 --> 00:38:50.579
Do you remember the video where Caleb is taught to clean his room

00:38:50.579 --> 00:38:52.579
and put away his toys?

00:38:52.579 --> 00:38:55.579
That video was a game changer for many children.

00:38:55.579 --> 00:38:58.579
They want to be just like Caleb.

00:38:58.579 --> 00:39:04.989
And now, when you enter their room, you can find the bed.

00:39:04.989 --> 00:39:09.989
When problems arise, attack the problem, not each other.

00:39:09.989 --> 00:39:13.989
It's not, how can I win? But how can we win?

00:39:13.989 --> 00:39:17.989
You'll see an excellent example of that in the follow-up video.

00:39:17.989 --> 00:39:31.769
Let's watch.

00:39:31.769 --> 00:39:34.769
Hey. Want some tea?

00:39:34.769 --> 00:39:37.769
Sure.

00:39:37.769 --> 00:39:45.820
Hey, babe. You and me.

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:46.820
We're a team, right?

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:48.820
Yeah, of course.

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:53.230
When I read this, I thought about us.

00:39:53.230 --> 00:40:03.639
So that they are no longer two, but one flesh.

00:40:03.639 --> 00:40:08.639
I know before you had to shoulder everything yourself for so long.

00:40:08.639 --> 00:40:10.639
And you did great.

00:40:10.639 --> 00:40:17.300
You've been raising two beautiful spiritual kids on your own.

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:18.300
But now you have me.

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:21.679
Yeah, I do.

00:40:21.679 --> 00:40:24.679
So, do you think sometimes we're not a team?

00:40:24.679 --> 00:40:26.679
Well, it's just sometimes our family worship.

00:40:26.679 --> 00:40:28.679
I get excited and I jump in.

00:40:28.679 --> 00:40:33.679
And I know I'm just so used to doing it after all these years.

00:40:33.679 --> 00:40:35.679
I know you're not trying to take over.

00:40:35.679 --> 00:40:38.679
And listen, I love the way you teach.

00:40:38.679 --> 00:40:42.679
I see how you can reach the kids in ways that I can't.

00:40:42.679 --> 00:40:44.679
Just let me guide it.

00:40:44.679 --> 00:40:47.679
And I'll make sure you can do that.

00:40:47.679 --> 00:40:49.679
Thanks, honey.

00:40:49.679 --> 00:40:51.679
Thanks for your patience.

00:40:51.679 --> 00:40:53.679
No, thank you for your patience.

00:40:53.679 --> 00:40:57.679
I'm a work in progress, but we make a great team.

00:40:57.679 --> 00:41:04.280
Why don't we look at what we're going to cover before our next family worship?

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.280
That sounds great.

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:14.530
Wasn't that a fine example of how to attack a problem?

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:16.530
Not your mate.

00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:17.530
No arguments.

00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:19.530
No raised voices.

00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:21.530
No accusations.

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:24.530
The husband had empathy for his wife.

00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:26.530
He didn't question her motives.

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:31.530
He realized that as a single parent, she'd been taking the lead for a long time.

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:36.530
And notice how she responded to her husband's kind counsel.

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:41.530
No doubt, it's going to be easy for the kids to respect their stepfather.

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:45.530
And they're going to learn how a husband and wife should treat each other

00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:47.530
and how they should pull together.

00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:53.840
Sometimes soon, you might want to consider these questions.

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:57.840
In what aspects of our marriage do we work well as a team?

00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:01.840
And then, how can we improve?

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:06.840
It pleases Jehovah when family members work together as a team.

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:09.840
That promotes peace in the family.

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:13.840
And our God is a God of peace.

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:21.250
Now, Brother John Echron will consider the final talk of this symposium.

00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:24.250
Follow the road map to family peace.

00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:35.670
Worship Jehovah together.

00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:39.670
Jehovah wants your family to be happy and peaceful.

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:43.670
But Jehovah does more than simply say, I hope you have a peaceful family life.

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:48.670
He explains exactly how we can get our family there.

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:51.670
I want you to imagine Jehovah laying out a map in front of you

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:53.670
and saying, see these landmarks?

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:56.670
Look for them on the road to peace.

00:42:56.670 --> 00:43:00.670
And if you see them, you're going in the right direction.

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:05.670
So far in this symposium, we've passed the landmarks of show love and respect,

00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:09.670
improving communication and working together as a team.

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:16.670
The last landmark we'll consider in this symposium is worshipping together as a family.

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:21.670
Worshiping together as a family promotes peace and brings his blessing.

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:24.670
Even if not all in your family or worshippers of Jehovah,

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:29.670
you can promote peace by maintaining a very good spiritual routine.

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:36.670
In the following dramatization, notice some common obstacles to worshipping Jehovah as a family.

00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:42.699
Hi.

00:43:42.699 --> 00:43:43.699
Hi babe.

00:43:43.699 --> 00:43:54.449
So what's for family worship this week?

00:43:54.449 --> 00:43:56.449
I think I got some good ideas.

00:43:56.449 --> 00:43:58.449
Yeah?

00:43:58.449 --> 00:44:01.449
Thank you for reading that.

00:44:01.449 --> 00:44:07.070
Let's just go ahead and ask the question.

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:12.610
So paragraph 13 of 14, how can we be generous?

00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:14.610
Anybody?

00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:23.610
Now the footnote that we just read really helps us to appreciate the definition of that quality.

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:28.610
Without the definition, we're left to wonder exactly what it is and how it connects

00:44:28.610 --> 00:44:34.070
to the other things that we've discussed this evening.

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:40.980
Again, can you go ahead and read the next one for us?

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:46.980
The Bible contains many examples of submissive individuals.

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:53.139
So are there examples?

00:44:53.139 --> 00:44:54.139
Sue?

00:44:54.139 --> 00:44:55.139
That's right.

00:44:55.139 --> 00:44:58.139
When we talk about examples, where do we start?

00:44:58.139 --> 00:45:00.139
There's examples in the past.

00:45:00.139 --> 00:45:07.139
There's even examples presently, and we could even be examples.

00:45:07.139 --> 00:45:14.900
That's the power of them.

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:16.900
Let's keep going.

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:26.139
That was a lot of reading.

00:45:26.139 --> 00:45:28.139
I know, right?

00:45:28.139 --> 00:45:34.139
I want to enjoy family worship, but I feel like the things that we are covering

00:45:34.139 --> 00:45:37.139
are just really not what I need right now.

00:45:37.139 --> 00:45:40.380
Yeah.

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:46.400
You know, I just don't know if this is what they need right now.

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:47.400
We'll keep working on it.

00:45:47.400 --> 00:46:00.619
I think we'd all agree that family worship was difficult to watch.

00:46:00.619 --> 00:46:02.619
It was uncomfortable for everyone.

00:46:02.619 --> 00:46:05.619
Clearly, Max and Irene had some obstacles.

00:46:05.619 --> 00:46:10.619
They needed to overcome to really worship Jehovah as a family.

00:46:10.619 --> 00:46:15.619
To start and keep a good habit going requires determination and resolve.

00:46:15.619 --> 00:46:18.619
So that's where you need to start for your family.

00:46:18.619 --> 00:46:23.619
You need to resolve that you're going to worship Jehovah as a family.

00:46:23.619 --> 00:46:30.619
Notice the resolve in Joshua's words at Joshua chapter 24 and verse 15.

00:46:30.619 --> 00:46:33.619
As Joshua chapter 24 and verse 15.

00:46:33.619 --> 00:46:43.059
Now, if it seems bad to you to serve Jehovah, choose for yourselves today whom you will serve.

00:46:43.059 --> 00:46:47.059
Whether the gods that your forefather served on the other side of the river,

00:46:47.059 --> 00:46:51.059
or the gods of the Amorites and whose land you're dwelling,

00:46:51.059 --> 00:46:58.530
but as for me and my household, we will serve Jehovah.

00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:04.530
Yes, worship of Jehovah as a family needs to be at the very center of your family life.

00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:09.530
Now, weekly family worship is not all that's involved in worshiping together as a family.

00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:15.530
Let's consider five ways we can worship together Jehovah as a family.

00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:18.530
One, prayer.

00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:24.530
Parents do not underestimate the impact that your prayers have on your children.

00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:28.530
When a child hears their parents pour out their hearts to Jehovah,

00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:32.530
that tells them that Jehovah is very real to their parents.

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:36.530
I can recall growing up listening to my father's prayers.

00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:40.530
Now, when I was young, I thought his prayers were very long,

00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:45.530
but as I grew older and really listened carefully to what he was saying,

00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:50.530
I could see how much of a close relationship he had with Jehovah.

00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:54.900
Two, discuss the daily text.

00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:59.900
It's an excellent habit and a very spiritual way to start the day.

00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:02.900
Three attending meetings.

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:05.900
Now, not just make sure our family is there at the meetings,

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:10.900
but they're involved, engaged, and work hard to prepare so all family members

00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:15.900
can have a meaningful comment at the meetings.

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:19.900
Four, share in the ministry regularly as a family.

00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:24.900
Now, sharing in the ministry together as a family draws us closer to our family members.

00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:29.900
When we hear them speak about the truth, we listen to their phone calls,

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:34.900
or we read their letters, we can feel their faith.

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:37.900
I loved going in the ministry with my mother,

00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:43.900
and listened to her skillfully use the Bible to answer questions.

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:50.900
And five, have a consistent, enjoyable, and meaningful family worship program.

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:52.900
Let's consider what that means.

00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:54.900
First of all, consistent.

00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:59.900
In the video, Max was trying to have the family worship consistently each week.

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:03.900
Is your family worship consistent each week?

00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:06.900
Is your family worship enjoyable?

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:09.900
In the video, the kids were bored.

00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:13.900
They were looking at their phones, checking the time,

00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:16.900
and week after week of kind of a question and answer style,

00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:20.900
led to the young people giving sort of one word answers.

00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:22.900
It did not look enjoyable.

00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:28.900
Now, would your family describe family worship as enjoyable?

00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:31.900
How about meaningful?

00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:36.900
What Max was using for material was material that he thought was meaningful.

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:40.900
But did it look like it was meaningful to the family?

00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:46.900
Does your family worship use material that is meaningful to your family?

00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:49.900
Now, after reviewing these five points,

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:54.900
we don't want you to be discouraged if it's a struggle to maintain a good routine.

00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:59.900
Life in this system has many challenges, trials, and unexpected events.

00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:02.900
So, stays positive.

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:05.900
And when your good routine breaks down from time to time,

00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:08.900
consider what adjustments you can make to be successful

00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:12.900
and get your spiritual routine back on track.

00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:17.900
Regularly ask Jehovah for his help and don't give up.

00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:20.900
Now, as you watch the following dramatization,

00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:23.900
notice how Max and Irene and the family work together

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:26.900
to make family worship successful.

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:36.820
March 15th, 2014, Watch Tower.

00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:40.820
Family worship, can you make it more enjoyable?

00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:44.820
The worship of Jehovah should not be boring.

00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:48.820
Address the needs of each family member.

00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:56.659
Babe, what do our kids need?

00:50:56.659 --> 00:50:59.659
What's actually going on in their lives?

00:50:59.659 --> 00:51:04.219
Family worship needs to include that.

00:51:04.219 --> 00:51:08.219
Maybe we need to pay more attention to what's going on with them.

00:51:08.219 --> 00:51:14.070
Talk to them, listen to them.

00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:16.070
I'm going to send you a link to a great watch to our article.

00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:21.559
I can't wait to read it.

00:51:21.559 --> 00:51:23.559
Max and I changed our approach.

00:51:23.559 --> 00:51:31.900
We found out what mattered to our kids.

00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:36.210
Like friends.

00:51:36.210 --> 00:51:38.210
Adjusting to a blended family.

00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:41.449
Dating.

00:51:41.449 --> 00:51:51.489
So we turned things around and used family worship

00:51:51.489 --> 00:52:08.409
to focus on what our kids really needed

00:52:08.409 --> 00:52:26.969
and to prepare ourselves for possible future trials.

00:52:27.969 --> 00:52:28.969
Good night.

00:52:28.969 --> 00:52:30.969
Good night.

00:52:30.969 --> 00:52:35.969
Family worship was cool.

00:52:35.969 --> 00:52:37.969
It was.

00:52:37.969 --> 00:52:39.969
I'm glad you liked it.

00:52:39.969 --> 00:52:41.969
Thank you.

00:52:41.969 --> 00:52:42.969
Good night, Cha.

00:52:42.969 --> 00:52:44.969
Good night.

00:52:44.969 --> 00:52:46.969
Hey, guess what?

00:52:46.969 --> 00:52:47.969
What?

00:52:47.969 --> 00:52:49.969
What?

00:52:49.969 --> 00:52:51.969
I applied to Bethel.

00:52:51.969 --> 00:52:52.969
You did?

00:52:52.969 --> 00:52:53.969
Yep.

00:52:53.969 --> 00:52:55.969
That's really exciting.

00:52:56.969 --> 00:52:58.969
I'm proud of you.

00:52:58.969 --> 00:52:59.969
Thanks.

00:52:59.969 --> 00:53:05.070
Congratulations.

00:53:05.070 --> 00:53:08.539
Thank you.

00:53:08.539 --> 00:53:10.539
Hey, selfie time, everybody.

00:53:10.539 --> 00:53:11.539
Yeah.

00:53:11.539 --> 00:53:12.539
All right, on three.

00:53:12.539 --> 00:53:13.539
We're going to say Bethel, OK?

00:53:13.539 --> 00:53:14.539
All right.

00:53:14.539 --> 00:53:15.539
All right.

00:53:15.539 --> 00:53:17.539
One, two, three.

00:53:17.539 --> 00:53:19.539
Bethel.

00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:41.250
We've come a long way.

00:53:41.250 --> 00:53:58.309
And through it all, Jehovah has taught us to love.

00:53:58.309 --> 00:54:02.309
And he's given our family peace.

00:54:02.309 --> 00:55:18.690
We can see that Max and Irene analyzed what was wrong

00:55:18.690 --> 00:55:22.690
with family worship and decided to change their approach.

00:55:22.690 --> 00:55:26.690
Let's examine how they did that and what it means for us.

00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:32.690
What did they do to make their family worship more meaningful?

00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:35.690
Well, Max and Irene had to ask themselves,

00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:38.690
what's going on in their kids' lives?

00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:41.690
What topics could they discuss at family worship

00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:44.690
that would truly be useful to their kids?

00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:47.690
Did you smile when you saw Max almost drop the glass?

00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:50.690
What his daughter talked about dating?

00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:52.690
But what a difference.

00:55:52.690 --> 00:55:55.690
Their efforts to listen and really understand what was happening

00:55:55.690 --> 00:55:59.690
with the kids made in the family worship.

00:55:59.690 --> 00:56:03.690
How did Max and Irene make family worship more enjoyable?

00:56:03.690 --> 00:56:08.690
Did you see how the family was reacting at family worship now?

00:56:08.690 --> 00:56:10.690
What a difference.

00:56:10.690 --> 00:56:12.690
The kids were smiling.

00:56:12.690 --> 00:56:15.690
They looked engaged in the discussion

00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:18.690
and touched by what they were discussing.

00:56:18.690 --> 00:56:23.690
So do what you can to make sure that your family feels relaxed and happy

00:56:23.690 --> 00:56:27.690
and that your family worship reflects the kind of happy and joyful God

00:56:27.690 --> 00:56:29.690
that Jehovah is.

00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:33.690
Remember, your family will often remember more about how they felt

00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:40.099
during family worship than maybe the exact details of what they learned.

00:56:40.099 --> 00:56:43.099
Keep worshiping Jehovah's a family.

00:56:43.099 --> 00:56:48.099
Keep your family worship consistent, enjoyable and meaningful

00:56:48.099 --> 00:56:52.099
and work together to overcome obstacles.

00:56:52.099 --> 00:56:57.099
Just like Max and Irene and the kids all worked together to solve problems

00:56:57.099 --> 00:57:00.099
and create a very peaceful family life.

00:57:00.099 --> 00:57:06.099
It was really beautiful to see how far they had come by applying Bible principles.

00:57:06.099 --> 00:57:11.099
In review, this symposium has taught us that Bible principles

00:57:11.099 --> 00:57:15.099
are used as a roadmap to family peace.

00:57:15.099 --> 00:57:20.099
Work hard to show love and respect, to improve communication,

00:57:20.099 --> 00:57:25.099
to work together as a team and to worship Jehovah together.

00:57:25.099 --> 00:57:32.099
And please be patient with one another as you form habits that lead to peace.

00:57:32.099 --> 00:57:35.099
With Jehovah's help, you and your family will enjoy peace

00:57:35.099 --> 00:57:39.599
that only he can provide.

00:57:39.599 --> 00:57:41.599
Thank you, brothers.

00:57:41.599 --> 00:57:45.599
We benefited from thinking about how we can apply the Bible principles

00:57:45.599 --> 00:57:52.599
you shared and from the practical lessons in the dramatizations.

00:57:52.599 --> 00:57:56.599
All of us long to see true peace on earth.

00:57:56.599 --> 00:57:58.599
How will that be accomplished?

00:57:58.599 --> 00:58:05.599
And how can we prove that we honor and support Jehovah's appointed King Christ Jesus?

00:58:05.599 --> 00:58:10.599
Let's listen as Brother Mark Numer, a helper to the teaching committee,

00:58:10.599 --> 00:58:14.599
wise these answers and more in the talk,

00:58:14.599 --> 00:58:25.280
loyally support the Prince of Peace.

00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:27.280
Imagine the scene.

00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:29.280
It's nighttime.

00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:34.280
You're in the Garden of Gethsemane with your close friends and beloved teacher.

00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:37.280
Suddenly, you hear a crowd coming.

00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:41.280
They're being led by a man you know, Judas Iscariot.

00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:45.280
He approaches Jesus and kisses him on the cheek.

00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:49.280
And steps aside as men move into arrest Jesus.

00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:52.280
Here emotions churn inside you.

00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:54.280
Your Master and Lord is being arrested.

00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:56.280
The Son of God.

00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:58.280
How can this be happening?

00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:02.280
What do you do before you can even decide what to do?

00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:08.280
Peter draws his sword and chops off the ear of the slave of the high priest.

00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:11.280
Then Jesus says to Peter,

00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:15.280
return your sword to its place.

00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:21.280
For those who take up the sword will perish by the sword.

00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:28.280
And then you watch the unbelievable as Jesus heals the man's ear.

00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:34.280
Peter must have thought he was a great and noble thing to fight in behalf of the Son of God.

00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:37.280
But Jesus didn't think so.

00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:43.280
With six words, return your sword to its place.

00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:48.280
Jesus taught his disciples an important lesson.

00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:54.280
This was not their fight, nor was it the time to fight.

00:59:54.280 --> 01:00:02.280
So in this talk, we're going to focus our attention on an insidious way that any of us,

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:11.280
like Peter, can become inadvertently involved in this world's conflicts without even realizing it.

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:17.280
And we will talk about how we can avoid making that serious mistake.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:25.280
But first, let's discuss why Jesus did not ask his father to send twelve legions of angels

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:28.280
to help him when being arrested.

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:31.280
It has to do with Jesus' name.

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:38.280
So please open your Bible to Isaiah chapter 9 and let's read verse 6.

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:42.280
Isaiah chapter 9 and verse 6.

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:46.280
Now we know Jesus has many titles,

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:53.909
but in this verse we're going to focus on on just one, verse 6.

01:00:53.909 --> 01:00:56.909
For a child has been born to us.

01:00:56.909 --> 01:00:58.909
A son has been given to us.

01:00:58.909 --> 01:01:01.909
And the rulership will rest on his shoulder.

01:01:01.909 --> 01:01:10.909
His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.

01:01:10.909 --> 01:01:14.909
Why is Jesus called Prince of Peace?

01:01:14.909 --> 01:01:23.909
Well, consider what Jehovah's Angels declared to the shepherds in the field at Jesus' birth at Luke chapter 2 and verse 14.

01:01:23.909 --> 01:01:31.909
They said, Glory in the heights above to God and upon earth peace among men of good will.

01:01:31.909 --> 01:01:36.909
How appropriate for the angels to announce at the birth of the destined Prince of Peace

01:01:36.909 --> 01:01:42.909
that there would be divine peace for those who have God's good will.

01:01:42.909 --> 01:01:45.909
But when will this become a reality?

01:01:45.909 --> 01:01:52.909
It didn't happen when Jesus was on earth and we certainly don't see peace today instead of peace, what do we see?

01:01:52.909 --> 01:01:59.909
We see the nations that are locked in hostilities and aggression and a competition for world dominance.

01:01:59.909 --> 01:02:06.909
We see global violence and bloodshed, but please don't lose heart.

01:02:06.909 --> 01:02:10.909
Because we don't see peace now does not mean it's not coming.

01:02:10.909 --> 01:02:13.909
Isaiah chapter 9 and verse 6.

01:02:13.909 --> 01:02:15.909
It's not just wishful thinking.

01:02:15.909 --> 01:02:20.909
It's a promise from Almighty God and Jehovah cannot lie.

01:02:20.909 --> 01:02:22.909
All his prophecies come true.

01:02:22.909 --> 01:02:29.909
In fact, let's read the last portion of verse 7 in Isaiah chapter 9.

01:02:29.909 --> 01:02:32.909
The last portion of verse 7.

01:02:32.909 --> 01:02:37.909
It says, the zeal of Jehovah of armies will do this.

01:02:37.909 --> 01:02:39.909
What does that mean?

01:02:39.909 --> 01:02:42.909
It means that Jehovah does nothing in a half-hearted way.

01:02:42.909 --> 01:02:44.909
He's zealous to bring peace and he will.

01:02:44.909 --> 01:02:53.179
We can be sure that whatever Jehovah promises, he will fully accomplish.

01:02:53.179 --> 01:02:56.179
So how will peace come to the earth?

01:02:56.179 --> 01:02:59.179
Did the Prince of Peace give us a clue?

01:02:59.179 --> 01:03:01.179
Yes, he did.

01:03:01.179 --> 01:03:07.179
In fact, the key to everlasting peace is on the lips of millions of people throughout the world.

01:03:07.179 --> 01:03:09.179
They know it by heart.

01:03:09.179 --> 01:03:18.159
But let's read it at Matthew chapter 6 and verse 9 and 10.

01:03:18.159 --> 01:03:21.159
Matthew chapter 6 and verse 9.

01:03:21.159 --> 01:03:23.159
What a beautiful thought for us.

01:03:23.159 --> 01:03:26.159
This is where everlasting peace is going to come through it.

01:03:26.159 --> 01:03:30.159
It depends on the fulfillment of these verses.

01:03:30.159 --> 01:03:32.159
Verse 9.

01:03:32.159 --> 01:03:34.159
You must pray then this way.

01:03:34.159 --> 01:03:37.159
Our Father in the heavens led your name.

01:03:37.159 --> 01:03:41.159
The name Jehovah be sanctified.

01:03:41.159 --> 01:03:44.159
The emphasis that we place on the name of God

01:03:44.159 --> 01:03:47.159
is not merely a matter of religious knowledge.

01:03:47.159 --> 01:03:52.159
Everyone must know God's name and treat it as something wholly and respected.

01:03:52.159 --> 01:03:55.159
It has to be something sacred.

01:03:55.159 --> 01:03:59.159
It must be cleared of all the reproach that has been heaped upon it.

01:03:59.159 --> 01:04:04.159
In fact, the well-being of the entire universe and its inhabitants

01:04:04.159 --> 01:04:10.159
depends upon the sanctification of Jehovah's name.

01:04:10.159 --> 01:04:13.159
Now let's look at verse 10.

01:04:13.159 --> 01:04:16.159
Let your kingdom come.

01:04:16.159 --> 01:04:21.159
Let your will take place as in heaven also on earth.

01:04:21.159 --> 01:04:23.159
God's kingdom.

01:04:23.159 --> 01:04:27.159
Two words, but so important.

01:04:27.159 --> 01:04:33.159
God's kingdom is the most powerful government humanity will ever see.

01:04:33.159 --> 01:04:39.159
There is no nation or empire that can withstand the might of God's kingdom.

01:04:40.159 --> 01:04:44.159
And any nation who thinks they can block the coming of God's kingdom

01:04:44.159 --> 01:04:50.159
is like an ant who plants itself firmly on the railroad track.

01:04:50.159 --> 01:04:52.159
And with his hand raised,

01:04:52.159 --> 01:04:54.159
defiantly shouts to the oncoming locomotive,

01:04:54.159 --> 01:04:58.159
stop, you can't run over me.

01:04:58.159 --> 01:05:03.159
Well, God's heavenly government has the power to destroy all present-day violent regimes.

01:05:03.159 --> 01:05:06.159
They're like ants to Jehovah.

01:05:06.159 --> 01:05:13.159
And he will eliminate their ability to wage war, format, conflict, and to shed blood.

01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:15.159
So yes, Matthew 6, 9, and 10.

01:05:15.159 --> 01:05:19.159
It's that valuable and important for lasting peace.

01:05:19.159 --> 01:05:23.159
God's kingdom is the only road to lasting peace.

01:05:23.159 --> 01:05:27.159
And in his role as king,

01:05:27.159 --> 01:05:31.159
Revelation chapter 19 and verse 15 describes Jesus

01:05:31.159 --> 01:05:35.159
as striking the nations with an iron rod

01:05:35.159 --> 01:05:38.159
soon Jehovah will give the command to his son.

01:05:38.159 --> 01:05:43.159
And he will destroy all the things that disrupt peace.

01:05:43.159 --> 01:05:47.159
God will be the terror that we have grown accustomed to living with,

01:05:47.159 --> 01:05:51.980
day in and day out.

01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:53.980
So what will happen next?

01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:55.980
This is what will happen.

01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:58.980
Psalm 37, 10 and 11.

01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:01.980
Let's open our Bibles here to Psalm 37, 10 and 11,

01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:06.980
and just allow this prophecy to absorb and to thrill our minds and our hearts

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:11.980
and give us a hope for the future.

01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:15.980
Verse 10, Psalm 37.

01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:17.980
Just a little while longer,

01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:22.980
and the wicked will be no more, a little while longer.

01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:26.980
You will look at where they were and they will not be there.

01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:28.980
Just a little while longer,

01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:31.980
just like children saying to their parents going on a trip,

01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:32.980
are we there yet?

01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:35.980
And the parents say just a little while longer.

01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:38.980
And that brings comfort to them.

01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:41.980
And it's the same with us.

01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:43.980
So imagine that.

01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:45.980
This means you go into the streets.

01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:47.980
You're looking for a wicked person.

01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:53.980
You would not be able to find even one the wicked will be no more.

01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:56.980
But the meek will possess the earth.

01:06:56.980 --> 01:06:58.980
That's what we're speaking about in verse 11.

01:06:58.980 --> 01:06:59.980
Let's read that.

01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:02.980
But the meek will possess the earth.

01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:08.980
And they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.

01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:11.980
We love reading that.

01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:13.980
Men will be at peace.

01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:16.980
They will be at peace with themselves, with their neighbors, with their God.

01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:18.980
How does that sound to you?

01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:20.980
Meditate on that.

01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:24.980
Can you see yourself there in a peaceful new world?

01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:28.980
Where the only news to tune into is regarding who's getting resurrected today.

01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:32.980
Which new person will you be assigned to teach about Jehovah?

01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:35.980
Can you imagine the joy of studying with a person,

01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:39.980
not just from a different culture, but from a different time period?

01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:42.980
Seeing things through their eyes.

01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:45.980
As they come to love, Jehovah, as you do.

01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:54.489
Well, soon, the Prince of Peace will turn this world into one of sheer delight.

01:07:54.489 --> 01:07:56.489
No more borders.

01:07:56.489 --> 01:07:57.489
No more threats.

01:07:57.489 --> 01:07:58.489
No more worries.

01:07:58.489 --> 01:08:03.489
Just an abundance of peace with your brothers and sisters.

01:08:03.489 --> 01:08:06.489
Do you want to be there?

01:08:06.489 --> 01:08:08.489
Me too.

01:08:08.489 --> 01:08:13.489
So how can we show our loyal support for the Prince of Peace?

01:08:13.489 --> 01:08:23.680
Please watch the following video and notice the different ways we can do this right now.

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:30.359
I am no part of the world.

01:08:30.359 --> 01:08:36.859
But is the world a part of me?

01:08:36.859 --> 01:08:43.859
I'm pressured every day to get involved in political issues that affect me socially.

01:08:43.859 --> 01:09:09.840
Environmentally and economically.

01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:13.840
That pressure could rob me of my peace of mind.

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:19.529
And influence how I think.

01:09:19.529 --> 01:09:24.529
I could take sides in my heart even if I'm not aware of it.

01:09:24.529 --> 01:09:38.020
But I know that Jehovah will care for all of mankind's concerns.

01:09:38.020 --> 01:10:11.050
By means of His kingdom, ruled by His Son, Jesus Christ.

01:10:11.050 --> 01:10:18.859
I show my support for Him in my prayers.

01:10:18.859 --> 01:10:32.460
In how I think and feel.

01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:37.460
And by teaching others what the kingdom will do for mankind.

01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:43.460
I know there are millions of brothers and sisters all over the world.

01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:47.460
Who lawyerly support the Prince of Peace just like me.

01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:48.460
Because I.

01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:53.439
I.

01:10:53.439 --> 01:11:01.890
I am no part of the world.

01:11:01.890 --> 01:11:04.890
What takes away the peace in the country where you live?

01:11:04.890 --> 01:11:08.890
In your community, in your town, in your society.

01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:12.890
Most likely it's the hot button social issues.

01:11:12.890 --> 01:11:18.890
Did you notice how our two brothers and sisters showed their loyal support for the Prince of Peace?

01:11:18.890 --> 01:11:20.890
What issues affected them?

01:11:20.890 --> 01:11:25.890
Unfair tax heights, blatant injustice, a disregard of the environment.

01:11:25.890 --> 01:11:28.890
All things in themselves seem like noble causes,

01:11:28.890 --> 01:11:30.890
worthy to get involved.

01:11:30.890 --> 01:11:32.890
How can they get away with this?

01:11:32.890 --> 01:11:33.890
It's not right.

01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:35.890
We should do something.

01:11:35.890 --> 01:11:37.890
Does that sound familiar?

01:11:37.890 --> 01:11:40.890
We may not have a literal sword in our hand.

01:11:40.890 --> 01:11:43.890
But we all have our Peter-like moments.

01:11:43.890 --> 01:11:48.890
And if we're not careful issues that are close to our heart can charge our emotions

01:11:48.890 --> 01:11:51.890
and we could lose our spiritual balance.

01:11:51.890 --> 01:11:55.890
So what can help us when we see things that are wrong?

01:11:55.890 --> 01:12:00.890
Remember what the Prince of Peace said to Peter, that highly charged moment.

01:12:00.890 --> 01:12:04.890
Return your sword to its place.

01:12:04.890 --> 01:12:07.890
In other words, this is not your fight.

01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:09.890
So what do we do?

01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:12.890
We do something far better than fight.

01:12:12.890 --> 01:12:13.890
We preach.

01:12:13.890 --> 01:12:16.890
Each time that we share the Kingdom news,

01:12:16.890 --> 01:12:20.890
we proclaim our support for Jesus' rule.

01:12:20.890 --> 01:12:22.890
But here's the thing.

01:12:22.890 --> 01:12:26.890
If we truly believe in the good news of the Kingdom,

01:12:26.890 --> 01:12:30.890
we will not do anything that hinders our ability to tell it.

01:12:30.890 --> 01:12:33.890
Once again, it's so important.

01:12:33.890 --> 01:12:37.890
If we truly believe in the good news of the Kingdom,

01:12:37.890 --> 01:12:42.890
we will not do anything that hinders our ability to tell it.

01:12:42.890 --> 01:12:43.890
Why?

01:12:43.890 --> 01:12:44.890
Let's find out.

01:12:44.890 --> 01:12:46.890
Let's open up to Peter's words himself.

01:12:46.890 --> 01:12:51.890
Peter, first Peter, chapter 2, and verse 12.

01:12:51.890 --> 01:12:56.649
First Peter, chapter 2, and verse 12.

01:12:56.649 --> 01:13:02.649
Peter helps us here with why we need to maintain our conduct properly.

01:13:02.649 --> 01:13:04.649
First Peter 2, 12.

01:13:04.649 --> 01:13:08.649
Maintain your conduct fine among the nations,

01:13:08.649 --> 01:13:11.649
so that when they accuse you of being wrongdoers,

01:13:11.649 --> 01:13:14.649
they may be eyewitnesses of your fine works.

01:13:14.649 --> 01:13:19.649
And as a result, glorify God in the day of His inspection.

01:13:19.649 --> 01:13:22.649
So Peter had to learn this.

01:13:22.649 --> 01:13:24.649
But do we see the connection?

01:13:24.649 --> 01:13:28.649
Our actions and words are directly linked to Jehovah.

01:13:28.649 --> 01:13:33.649
When people see us, they see it people that worships Jehovah.

01:13:33.649 --> 01:13:38.649
And when people hear us, they hear of people that worship Jehovah.

01:13:38.649 --> 01:13:44.649
Imagine how our freeness of speech to speak about God's Kingdom would be hindered,

01:13:44.649 --> 01:13:48.649
if we were to voice a position for a political issue.

01:13:48.649 --> 01:13:50.649
And it can happen so easily.

01:13:50.649 --> 01:13:54.649
It can happen at work or at school with relatives and so forth.

01:13:54.649 --> 01:13:57.649
Satan sets the trap masterfully.

01:13:57.649 --> 01:13:59.649
He's just waiting.

01:13:59.649 --> 01:14:04.649
If he can only make us chop off the ear of anything in this world that causes hurt

01:14:04.649 --> 01:14:06.649
and indignation in our heart.

01:14:06.649 --> 01:14:11.649
If he can hook our heart strings by getting us emotionally charged,

01:14:11.649 --> 01:14:14.649
he can then step back and reel us in.

01:14:14.649 --> 01:14:17.649
The new world, our hope for true peace,

01:14:17.649 --> 01:14:21.649
it all starts to fade into the background.

01:14:21.649 --> 01:14:24.649
Don't give him that chance.

01:14:24.649 --> 01:14:30.649
Be determined to do what Titus chapter 3 and verse 1 and 2 tell us.

01:14:30.649 --> 01:14:31.649
Let's read that.

01:14:31.649 --> 01:14:39.260
Titus chapter 3 and verse 1 and 2.

01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:42.260
Here's the scriptural admonition.

01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:51.500
Continue reminding them to be in subjection and to be obedient to governments and authorities,

01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:54.500
to be ready for every good work,

01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:57.500
to speak injuriously of no one,

01:14:57.500 --> 01:14:59.500
not to be quarrelsome,

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:04.500
but to be reasonable displaying all mildness toward all men.

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:10.500
Be in subjection and be obedient to governments and authorities.

01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:13.500
Well, now let's break that down in practical terms.

01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:14.500
What does it mean?

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:18.500
It means to obey the laws of the land and pay taxes,

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:22.500
not to speak negatively about the superior authorities,

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:25.500
to be careful not to take sides on political issues,

01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:28.500
not even in our hearts.

01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:31.500
Do you remember that expression from the video?

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:33.500
I'm not a part of the world,

01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:36.500
but is the world a part of me.

01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:40.500
Of course, when we find ourselves between Caesar's law and God's law,

01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:42.500
we know what to do.

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:46.500
We apply Acts chapter 5 and verse 29 and obey God as rule rather than men.

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:48.500
We know that.

01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:52.500
But like Jesus who healed the ear of the armed guard Malcus,

01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:56.500
we're determined to react with mildness when provoked

01:15:56.500 --> 01:16:00.500
by an injustice or cruelty in this world.

01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:04.359
In conclusion,

01:16:04.359 --> 01:16:09.359
we have the indescribable privilege to honor the Prince of Peace

01:16:09.359 --> 01:16:14.359
and how reassuring it is to know that Jesus understands our feelings.

01:16:14.359 --> 01:16:19.359
He understands our emotions when we see things that we know are wrong.

01:16:19.359 --> 01:16:22.359
He knows these things hurt our heart.

01:16:22.359 --> 01:16:25.359
We just want to make things right.

01:16:25.359 --> 01:16:28.359
But remember the critical lesson

01:16:28.359 --> 01:16:31.359
he taught his apostles in the Garden of Gethsemane.

01:16:31.359 --> 01:16:35.359
This is not your fight.

01:16:35.359 --> 01:16:40.760
Rather, Jehovah the King of Eternity

01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:43.760
and Jesus the Prince of Peace are telling us,

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:45.760
this is our fight.

01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:47.760
Leave it in our hands.

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:51.760
Soon the prophecy at Isaiah chapter 9 verse 6 and 7

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:53.760
will be fulfilled completely.

01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:55.760
In the meantime,

01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:57.760
keep preaching about the kingdom.

01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:01.760
Avoid saying or doing anything that suggests taking sides

01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:03.760
on a political issue.

01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:06.760
Don't allow yourself to chop off the ear of the injustices

01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:09.760
and the causes of conflict of this old world.

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:13.760
Peter tried that, but it didn't work.

01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:16.760
He learned a big lesson that day in the Garden

01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:18.760
and he never forgot it.

01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:20.760
May we never forget it either.

01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:24.760
Now is the time to show your active and loyal support

01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:26.760
for the Prince of Peace

01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:28.760
as we echo Peter's words

01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:31.760
at 2 Peter 3.14

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:33.760
and do our utmost to be found

01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:36.760
finally by Jehovah and the Prince of Peace,

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:41.760
spotless and unblemished and in peace.

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:43.760
Thank you, Brother Numer.

01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:45.760
For strengthening our determination

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:47.760
to give our undivided support

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:51.760
to God's appointed King Christ Jesus.

01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:55.760
This brings us to the final talk of today's session.

01:17:55.760 --> 01:18:01.760
Jesus promised to give his followers peace.

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:05.760
Why is the peace that Jesus gives far superior

01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:08.760
to any peace at this world promises?

01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:12.760
And how can we safeguard the gift of peace

01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:14.760
that Jesus has given us?

01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:18.170
Please follow along

01:18:18.170 --> 01:18:20.170
as Brother Anthony Morris,

01:18:20.170 --> 01:18:22.170
a member of the governing body,

01:18:22.170 --> 01:18:24.170
delivers the talk,

01:18:24.170 --> 01:18:27.170
do not be misled by imitation peace.

01:18:27.170 --> 01:18:37.619
Jesus taught us that Satan

01:18:37.619 --> 01:18:41.619
is the father of the lie.

01:18:41.619 --> 01:18:45.619
We recall that he deceived Eve a perfect woman.

01:18:45.619 --> 01:18:50.619
He lied about our precious Jehovah.

01:18:50.619 --> 01:18:53.619
Now, you're familiar with many of you

01:18:53.619 --> 01:18:55.619
with the Revelation chapter 12,

01:18:55.619 --> 01:19:00.619
invite you to find that Revelation chapter 12.

01:19:00.619 --> 01:19:02.619
And in this chapter,

01:19:02.619 --> 01:19:04.619
verses 7 and 8,

01:19:04.619 --> 01:19:07.619
addressed the fact that the war broke out in heaven.

01:19:07.619 --> 01:19:09.619
But notice,

01:19:09.619 --> 01:19:13.619
after they're kicked out of heaven,

01:19:13.619 --> 01:19:14.619
in verse 9,

01:19:14.619 --> 01:19:15.619
we read,

01:19:15.619 --> 01:19:18.619
so down the great dragon was hurled,

01:19:18.619 --> 01:19:20.619
the original serpent,

01:19:20.619 --> 01:19:22.619
the one called devil and Satan,

01:19:22.619 --> 01:19:24.619
who was misleading

01:19:24.619 --> 01:19:27.619
the entire inhabited earth.

01:19:27.619 --> 01:19:29.619
He was hurled down to the earth,

01:19:29.619 --> 01:19:33.619
and his angels were hurled down with him.

01:19:33.619 --> 01:19:38.619
Now, I read it that way specifically,

01:19:38.619 --> 01:19:42.619
but see what it doesn't say is

01:19:42.619 --> 01:19:44.619
in the middle part of verse 9,

01:19:44.619 --> 01:19:47.619
Satan who's trying

01:19:47.619 --> 01:19:51.619
to mislead the entire inhabited earth.

01:19:51.619 --> 01:19:53.619
No.

01:19:53.619 --> 01:19:59.619
He is misleading the entire inhabited earth.

01:19:59.619 --> 01:20:01.619
That's crucial to understand,

01:20:01.619 --> 01:20:04.619
when we think about the theme of this talk,

01:20:04.619 --> 01:20:07.619
not to be misled by imitation peace,

01:20:07.619 --> 01:20:10.619
because as the rule of the world,

01:20:10.619 --> 01:20:12.619
that's what he's out to do,

01:20:12.619 --> 01:20:13.619
is mislead.

01:20:13.619 --> 01:20:14.619
In fact,

01:20:14.619 --> 01:20:16.619
an interesting point here,

01:20:16.619 --> 01:20:19.619
in 2 Corinthians chapter 11,

01:20:19.619 --> 01:20:22.619
to appreciate

01:20:22.619 --> 01:20:24.619
how he goes about misleading,

01:20:24.619 --> 01:20:27.619
or at least it's addressed here

01:20:27.619 --> 01:20:31.619
to serve as a good warning for us,

01:20:31.619 --> 01:20:34.619
and an interesting point

01:20:34.619 --> 01:20:38.619
with the revision of the New World Translation,

01:20:38.619 --> 01:20:42.619
for those of you in the truth before 2013,

01:20:42.619 --> 01:20:44.619
when it was revised,

01:20:44.619 --> 01:20:45.619
you'll remember this,

01:20:45.619 --> 01:20:47.619
we'd see verse 14,

01:20:47.619 --> 01:20:49.619
2 Corinthians chapter 11,

01:20:49.619 --> 01:20:51.619
and no wonder for Satan himself

01:20:51.619 --> 01:20:54.619
keeps disguising himself

01:20:54.619 --> 01:20:56.619
as an angel of light.

01:20:56.619 --> 01:21:01.619
Now, the New World Translation used to say

01:21:01.619 --> 01:21:03.619
before the revision

01:21:03.619 --> 01:21:05.619
transforms himself

01:21:05.619 --> 01:21:07.619
into an angel of light.

01:21:07.619 --> 01:21:09.619
Well,

01:21:09.619 --> 01:21:13.619
the very English word metamorphosis,

01:21:13.619 --> 01:21:15.619
like for a caterpillar,

01:21:15.619 --> 01:21:18.619
transforming into a beautiful butterfly,

01:21:18.619 --> 01:21:21.619
that's where it comes from the Greek language,

01:21:21.619 --> 01:21:26.619
and that word was not in verse 14.

01:21:26.619 --> 01:21:30.619
No, because Satan can't transform himself

01:21:30.619 --> 01:21:32.619
into an angel of light,

01:21:32.619 --> 01:21:34.619
so it's an improved translation,

01:21:34.619 --> 01:21:37.619
but he does disguise.

01:21:37.619 --> 01:21:39.619
He's a masquerader,

01:21:39.619 --> 01:21:41.619
and he does that

01:21:41.619 --> 01:21:44.619
with the subject of peace.

01:21:44.619 --> 01:21:48.619
His world offers a sort of peace,

01:21:48.619 --> 01:21:52.619
but it's imitation peace.

01:21:52.619 --> 01:21:54.619
Now, Jesus has distinguished,

01:21:54.619 --> 01:21:57.619
though, with the peace that he gives,

01:21:57.619 --> 01:22:00.619
and if you'll follow long here in John,

01:22:00.619 --> 01:22:03.619
in chapter 14,

01:22:03.619 --> 01:22:06.619
he himself explains it to us,

01:22:06.619 --> 01:22:09.619
we treasure the gospel accounts.

01:22:09.619 --> 01:22:11.619
Verse 27,

01:22:11.619 --> 01:22:13.619
I leave you peace.

01:22:13.619 --> 01:22:16.619
I give you my peace.

01:22:16.619 --> 01:22:20.619
I do not give it to you the way the world gives it.

01:22:20.619 --> 01:22:22.619
Do not let your hearts be troubled,

01:22:22.619 --> 01:22:25.619
nor let them shrink out of fear.

01:22:25.619 --> 01:22:29.619
So Jesus gives us his peace.

01:22:29.619 --> 01:22:32.619
See, and the peace that Jesus gives us,

01:22:32.619 --> 01:22:34.619
it's this inner calm,

01:22:34.619 --> 01:22:35.619
you know, the truth,

01:22:35.619 --> 01:22:37.619
and Jesus gives us the peace.

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:41.619
We have this confidence that he loves us,

01:22:41.619 --> 01:22:42.619
Jehovah loves us,

01:22:42.619 --> 01:22:44.619
so that we enjoy a good,

01:22:44.619 --> 01:22:47.619
peaceful relationship with them

01:22:47.619 --> 01:22:49.619
and a good conscience.

01:22:49.619 --> 01:22:51.619
And we look forward to the kingdom

01:22:51.619 --> 01:22:55.619
removing all war and death.

01:22:55.619 --> 01:22:58.619
Now, point to make here,

01:22:58.619 --> 01:23:01.619
Satan wants us to trade

01:23:01.619 --> 01:23:03.619
the peace that Jesus gives

01:23:03.619 --> 01:23:06.619
for his imitation peace

01:23:06.619 --> 01:23:11.619
that he has advertised in the world.

01:23:11.619 --> 01:23:13.619
Now, in this talk,

01:23:13.619 --> 01:23:18.619
we will consider three forms of imitation peace,

01:23:18.619 --> 01:23:22.619
and why the peace that Jesus gives

01:23:22.619 --> 01:23:25.619
is superior.

01:23:25.619 --> 01:23:29.619
The first one has to do with material things,

01:23:29.619 --> 01:23:32.619
how they'll not bring true peace,

01:23:32.619 --> 01:23:34.619
and to help us with that,

01:23:34.619 --> 01:23:37.619
turn to Matthew chapter four,

01:23:37.619 --> 01:23:42.619
and we'll be referring to this chapter

01:23:42.619 --> 01:23:44.619
throughout this particular talk about,

01:23:44.619 --> 01:23:47.619
not being misled by imitation peace,

01:23:47.619 --> 01:23:49.619
and this one connected with material things,

01:23:49.619 --> 01:23:51.619
how they don't bring true peace

01:23:51.619 --> 01:23:54.619
in the example Jesus sets for us here.

01:23:54.619 --> 01:23:57.619
So, Matthew chapter four,

01:23:57.619 --> 01:23:59.619
then Jesus was led by the Spirit

01:23:59.619 --> 01:24:00.619
up into the wilderness

01:24:00.619 --> 01:24:03.619
to be tempted by the devil.

01:24:03.619 --> 01:24:06.619
After he had fasted for forty days and forty nights,

01:24:06.619 --> 01:24:08.619
he felt hungry.

01:24:08.619 --> 01:24:11.619
An attempter approached and said to him,

01:24:11.619 --> 01:24:14.619
if you are a son of God,

01:24:14.619 --> 01:24:18.619
tell these stones become loaves of bread.

01:24:18.619 --> 01:24:20.619
But he answered,

01:24:20.619 --> 01:24:22.619
it is written,

01:24:22.619 --> 01:24:25.619
man must live not on bread alone,

01:24:25.619 --> 01:24:27.619
but on every word that comes

01:24:27.619 --> 01:24:30.619
from Jehovah's mouth.

01:24:30.619 --> 01:24:32.619
That a beautiful rebuttal.

01:24:32.619 --> 01:24:36.619
See, Jesus refused to trade his peace

01:24:36.619 --> 01:24:38.619
for material things,

01:24:38.619 --> 01:24:40.619
and in this case bread,

01:24:40.619 --> 01:24:42.619
even though he was hungry.

01:24:42.619 --> 01:24:46.619
So, serving Jehovah was more important to him

01:24:46.619 --> 01:24:49.619
than material things, say.

01:24:49.619 --> 01:24:50.619
And in the world,

01:24:50.619 --> 01:24:53.619
they have this thinking about,

01:24:53.619 --> 01:24:56.619
well, you need a certain amount

01:24:56.619 --> 01:24:59.619
of money to retire,

01:24:59.619 --> 01:25:04.619
and they are constantly focused on material things.

01:25:04.619 --> 01:25:06.619
Not Jesus, see.

01:25:06.619 --> 01:25:11.619
Superior peace from Jehovah God.

01:25:11.619 --> 01:25:14.619
So, it is only temporary anyway

01:25:14.619 --> 01:25:17.619
that the material benefits that people seek

01:25:17.619 --> 01:25:20.619
and pursue throughout their lives.

01:25:20.619 --> 01:25:24.619
Now, we can enjoy true contentment

01:25:24.619 --> 01:25:28.619
because Jehovah God is going to care for us.

01:25:28.619 --> 01:25:33.619
We know that many have personal experiences to prove that.

01:25:33.619 --> 01:25:35.619
Now, in the following video,

01:25:35.619 --> 01:25:37.619
see what a brother learned

01:25:37.619 --> 01:25:42.619
about the so-called peace the world promises.

01:25:42.619 --> 01:25:49.539
As a family,

01:25:49.539 --> 01:25:51.539
we were doing very well spiritually.

01:25:51.539 --> 01:25:54.539
We did family worship, preaching,

01:25:54.539 --> 01:25:57.539
and going to the meetings together.

01:25:57.539 --> 01:26:01.079
After some time,

01:26:01.079 --> 01:26:04.079
we began to encounter financial problems.

01:26:04.079 --> 01:26:05.079
At times,

01:26:05.079 --> 01:26:11.539
we did not even have money to buy food for each day.

01:26:11.539 --> 01:26:14.539
Many people in our area were going to South Africa

01:26:14.539 --> 01:26:17.539
to provide basic needs for their families.

01:26:17.539 --> 01:26:20.539
So, I decided to go as well,

01:26:20.539 --> 01:26:22.539
leaving behind my wife

01:26:22.539 --> 01:26:34.140
to take care of our seven children.

01:26:34.140 --> 01:26:36.140
This affected me spiritually

01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:38.140
because I did not know the language,

01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:40.140
I was unable to preach,

01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:43.140
and I did not benefit from the meetings.

01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:45.140
Being so far from my family

01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:50.140
caused me to neglect my responsibility as a family head.

01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:51.140
As a result,

01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:54.140
my family grew weak spiritually,

01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:57.140
and we all missed each other very much.

01:26:57.140 --> 01:27:01.140
I realized that I had made a wrong decision going abroad.

01:27:01.140 --> 01:27:04.140
My conscience started to trouble me greatly.

01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:07.140
Then I remembered the example of Baruch,

01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:13.000
founded Jeremiah chapter 45, verse 5.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:18.279
Baruch may have wanted to pursue material riches as I had.

01:27:18.279 --> 01:27:22.279
When he was helped, he returned.

01:27:22.279 --> 01:27:26.279
I decided then to put Jehovah in first place,

01:27:26.279 --> 01:27:29.279
instead of searching for material things.

01:27:29.279 --> 01:27:32.279
So I started to make changes to go home,

01:27:32.279 --> 01:27:36.909
and help my family spiritually.

01:27:36.909 --> 01:27:39.909
When I left South Africa and reached the border of Malawi,

01:27:39.909 --> 01:27:42.909
after leaving my family for about six months,

01:27:42.909 --> 01:27:46.909
I felt great happiness in my heart,

01:27:46.909 --> 01:27:49.909
and I am still happy till now.

01:27:49.909 --> 01:27:52.909
Studying the Bible has helped me.

01:27:52.909 --> 01:27:55.909
We still encounter financial problems,

01:27:55.909 --> 01:27:58.909
but I remember that in Satan's world,

01:27:58.909 --> 01:28:02.909
there is no way we can go and have no problems.

01:28:02.909 --> 01:28:05.909
Now I serve as an elder.

01:28:05.909 --> 01:28:08.909
My family is progressing spiritually,

01:28:08.909 --> 01:28:11.909
and this makes me very happy,

01:28:11.909 --> 01:28:22.090
because my relationship with Jehovah is strong.

01:28:22.090 --> 01:28:26.090
Yes, he learned a hard lesson.

01:28:26.090 --> 01:28:29.090
He goes to South Africa,

01:28:29.090 --> 01:28:33.090
meetings are interrupted, no field service,

01:28:33.090 --> 01:28:36.090
and then he remembers Baruch,

01:28:36.090 --> 01:28:39.090
secretary for Jeremiah,

01:28:39.090 --> 01:28:42.090
and he returns to be with his family,

01:28:42.090 --> 01:28:44.090
putting the kingdom first,

01:28:44.090 --> 01:28:46.090
and we appreciate him being truthful

01:28:46.090 --> 01:28:48.090
and sharing that experience.

01:28:48.090 --> 01:28:54.090
That's imitation peace going after material things.

01:28:54.090 --> 01:28:58.090
Now, this next is quite interesting,

01:28:58.090 --> 01:29:00.090
so pay close attention,

01:29:00.090 --> 01:29:05.090
because there may be some listening that need this counsel.

01:29:05.090 --> 01:29:10.090
Satan's world says that we can ignore Bible standards,

01:29:10.090 --> 01:29:15.090
and we might need to ignore some of them to gain peace of mind.

01:29:15.090 --> 01:29:20.090
Here's two examples that we're going to analyze in this talk.

01:29:20.090 --> 01:29:25.090
A person may reason that marrying an unbeliever

01:29:25.090 --> 01:29:29.090
or obtaining an unscriptural divorce

01:29:29.090 --> 01:29:32.090
will make life easier,

01:29:32.090 --> 01:29:35.090
and they start reasoning.

01:29:35.090 --> 01:29:38.090
I just want to get married,

01:29:38.090 --> 01:29:41.090
he's an unbeliever, but he's a nice person.

01:29:41.090 --> 01:29:45.090
Things like that go on with the treacherous heart.

01:29:45.090 --> 01:29:50.090
Again, we go to the example of our Lord and Master Jesus.

01:29:50.090 --> 01:29:56.090
We're going to read verses five through seven of Matthew four.

01:29:56.090 --> 01:30:00.090
Then the devil took him along into the holy city,

01:30:00.090 --> 01:30:04.090
and he stationed him on the battlement of the temple,

01:30:04.090 --> 01:30:06.090
and said to him,

01:30:06.090 --> 01:30:08.090
if you are a son of God,

01:30:08.090 --> 01:30:10.090
throw yourself down,

01:30:10.090 --> 01:30:12.090
for it is written,

01:30:12.090 --> 01:30:15.090
he will give his angels a command concerning you,

01:30:15.090 --> 01:30:18.090
and they will carry you on their hands

01:30:18.090 --> 01:30:23.090
so that you may not strike your foot against a stone.

01:30:23.090 --> 01:30:25.090
Jesus said to him,

01:30:25.090 --> 01:30:27.090
again, it is written,

01:30:27.090 --> 01:30:33.090
you must not put your whole of your God to the test.

01:30:33.090 --> 01:30:36.090
See, Jesus made that very clear.

01:30:36.090 --> 01:30:39.090
He was going to be obedient to his father,

01:30:39.090 --> 01:30:42.090
and wasn't going to worry about

01:30:42.090 --> 01:30:45.090
being testy with such an experience

01:30:45.090 --> 01:30:48.090
as the devil proposed there.

01:30:48.090 --> 01:30:50.090
So,

01:30:50.090 --> 01:30:53.090
obedience.

01:30:53.090 --> 01:30:55.090
See, Jesus twice,

01:30:55.090 --> 01:30:57.090
in the moment we'll read another one,

01:30:57.090 --> 01:30:58.090
it is written.

01:30:58.090 --> 01:30:59.090
He sticks with the scriptures,

01:30:59.090 --> 01:31:01.090
Jehovah's thinking,

01:31:01.090 --> 01:31:06.090
and he refused to disobey Jehovah.

01:31:06.090 --> 01:31:09.090
Now, here's the question.

01:31:09.090 --> 01:31:14.090
Why is the piece that Jesus gives superior to the pursuit

01:31:14.090 --> 01:31:20.090
of unscriptural solutions to our problems?

01:31:20.090 --> 01:31:22.090
Let that sink in.

01:31:22.090 --> 01:31:26.090
Why is the piece that Jesus gives superior

01:31:26.090 --> 01:31:30.090
to the pursuit of unscriptural solutions to our problems?

01:31:30.090 --> 01:31:31.090
For example,

01:31:31.090 --> 01:31:34.090
marrying an unbeliever.

01:31:34.090 --> 01:31:36.090
That will likely bring,

01:31:36.090 --> 01:31:38.090
and as has happened time after time,

01:31:38.090 --> 01:31:41.090
bring that person greater pain

01:31:41.090 --> 01:31:45.340
than the longing they felt when they were single.

01:31:45.340 --> 01:31:47.340
I've personally seen that

01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:49.340
all too many times

01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:51.340
in various congregations

01:31:51.340 --> 01:31:55.340
at the privilege to serve in.

01:31:55.340 --> 01:31:57.340
You see, the other one is

01:31:57.340 --> 01:32:00.340
unscriptural divorce.

01:32:01.340 --> 01:32:04.340
It often leads to immoral conduct.

01:32:04.340 --> 01:32:07.340
It certainly leads to a troubled conscience,

01:32:07.340 --> 01:32:09.340
emotional damage,

01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:13.340
and of course a loss of privileges.

01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:17.340
Now, this is very important to keep in mind,

01:32:17.340 --> 01:32:20.340
while it's true

01:32:20.340 --> 01:32:23.340
to imperfect individuals married to each other,

01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:26.340
well, there's going to be difficulties.

01:32:26.340 --> 01:32:29.340
There's going to be challenges,

01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:32.340
but see, stop and think about this.

01:32:32.340 --> 01:32:35.340
When you're having difficulties,

01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:38.340
don't forget that marriage

01:32:38.340 --> 01:32:41.340
is a sacred arrangement.

01:32:41.340 --> 01:32:45.340
The world totally has forgotten that.

01:32:45.340 --> 01:32:49.340
So Jehovah will strengthen

01:32:49.340 --> 01:32:53.340
both to make a success.

01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:55.340
Gotta keep that in mind.

01:32:55.340 --> 01:32:58.340
Jehovah will strengthen and help

01:32:58.340 --> 01:33:00.340
so that you can succeed,

01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:02.340
because this is his sacred arrangement,

01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:04.340
and the devil has been attacking

01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:06.340
the family arrangement

01:33:06.340 --> 01:33:09.340
all through the last days of the system,

01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:11.340
and he's intensifying it

01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:13.340
as he gets closer to

01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:16.340
being thrown into the abyss.

01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:19.340
Now, in the following video,

01:33:19.340 --> 01:33:22.340
notice the results of pursuing

01:33:22.340 --> 01:33:26.810
imitation peace.

01:33:26.810 --> 01:33:29.810
newly married life came with a lot of

01:33:29.810 --> 01:33:31.810
unexpected challenges.

01:33:31.810 --> 01:33:34.810
You dream about the way your marriage will go,

01:33:34.810 --> 01:33:40.659
but then the reality is quite different.

01:33:40.659 --> 01:33:42.659
All we ever did was argue,

01:33:42.659 --> 01:33:45.659
or we wouldn't speak to one another.

01:33:45.659 --> 01:33:47.659
We never ever went to the elders.

01:33:47.659 --> 01:33:49.659
We just didn't want to bother them.

01:33:49.659 --> 01:33:51.659
We just felt, you know, we needed to

01:33:51.659 --> 01:33:55.449
figure it out ourselves.

01:33:55.449 --> 01:33:57.449
We decided if the household

01:33:58.449 --> 01:34:05.699
would separate.

01:34:05.699 --> 01:34:07.699
The separation wasn't a good thing,

01:34:07.699 --> 01:34:09.699
because in some respects,

01:34:09.699 --> 01:34:11.699
it made things worse.

01:34:11.699 --> 01:34:13.699
It did have an impact on the boys.

01:34:13.699 --> 01:34:15.699
They started acting out.

01:34:15.699 --> 01:34:17.699
They got into some trouble

01:34:17.699 --> 01:34:21.270
with the police one time.

01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:23.270
And there was a loneliness

01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:25.270
because you've gotten married,

01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:27.270
and now you don't have that,

01:34:27.270 --> 01:34:29.270
and you're by yourself.

01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:31.270
And the same old routine went on

01:34:31.270 --> 01:34:35.270
looking and cleaning and doing laundry and working.

01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:38.270
I felt sick to my stomach.

01:34:38.270 --> 01:34:40.270
I had a hard time getting up

01:34:40.270 --> 01:34:42.270
every morning and facing the world.

01:34:42.270 --> 01:34:44.270
At that point, I felt that I needed

01:34:44.270 --> 01:34:47.270
to have the elders help out a little bit.

01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:50.270
I did pray for Jehovah's help to direct me,

01:34:50.270 --> 01:34:52.270
and kept wondering why Jehovah

01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:55.270
wasn't really answering my prayers,

01:34:55.270 --> 01:34:58.270
but I kind of realized now

01:34:58.270 --> 01:35:01.270
that it was because we were separated.

01:35:01.270 --> 01:35:03.270
The expectations of the separation

01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:06.270
were not at all what I was thinking.

01:35:06.270 --> 01:35:09.270
I reflected on the marriage vows.

01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:11.270
One of the things I thought about

01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:13.270
was a sister in our congregation.

01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:15.270
She was married to an unbeliever,

01:35:15.270 --> 01:35:17.270
and then she learned the truth.

01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:19.270
And he was so violent.

01:35:19.270 --> 01:35:21.270
He would beat her.

01:35:21.270 --> 01:35:22.270
He would burn her books.

01:35:22.270 --> 01:35:24.270
He would burn her clothes.

01:35:24.270 --> 01:35:27.270
He did not allow her children to attend the meetings.

01:35:27.270 --> 01:35:30.270
And I thought about the problems that Darryl and I had,

01:35:30.270 --> 01:35:32.270
and I thought, well, Darryl is a kind person.

01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:33.270
He's never done that.

01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:35.270
And I thought, you know,

01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:38.270
this is something that we need to really work on.

01:35:38.270 --> 01:35:41.270
We need to really put forth the effort

01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:43.270
to start applying Bible principles

01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:45.270
to put Jehovah first in our life,

01:35:45.270 --> 01:35:50.270
so that we can bring our marriage back into union with Jehovah.

01:35:50.270 --> 01:35:54.270
I realized that it wasn't what I wanted.

01:35:54.270 --> 01:35:56.270
It was what Jehovah wanted.

01:35:57.270 --> 01:36:02.119
There was just no other choice.

01:36:02.119 --> 01:36:04.119
Jehovah wasn't going to bless us

01:36:04.119 --> 01:36:07.119
unless we got back together.

01:36:07.119 --> 01:36:09.119
When we got back together,

01:36:09.119 --> 01:36:11.119
our marriage was still a work in progress.

01:36:11.119 --> 01:36:14.119
You can't have a perfect marriage in this world,

01:36:14.119 --> 01:36:16.119
but you can sure make it better

01:36:16.119 --> 01:36:18.119
when you put Jehovah first.

01:36:18.119 --> 01:36:20.119
We enjoyed feelings towards each other.

01:36:20.119 --> 01:36:22.119
I felt closer to Debbie.

01:36:22.119 --> 01:36:26.619
Debbie and I have been married now 48 years.

01:36:27.619 --> 01:36:31.619
Separation does not make anything better at all.

01:36:31.619 --> 01:36:34.619
If you even have an inkling of love for one another,

01:36:34.619 --> 01:36:36.619
you want to work on that

01:36:36.619 --> 01:36:38.619
and you want to make it bloom

01:36:38.619 --> 01:36:40.619
so that Jehovah can bless it.

01:36:40.619 --> 01:36:42.619
The blessings have been endless.

01:36:42.619 --> 01:36:46.619
Our children are all doing fantastic in the truth.

01:36:46.619 --> 01:36:49.619
Jehovah said taste and see that it is good,

01:36:49.619 --> 01:36:51.619
so we've got to do that.

01:36:57.739 --> 01:37:00.739
We really appreciated this couple sharing.

01:37:00.739 --> 01:37:04.739
The experience with the brotherhood.

01:37:04.739 --> 01:37:06.739
He learned, you know,

01:37:06.739 --> 01:37:08.739
they're always arguing,

01:37:08.739 --> 01:37:12.739
and it's all they did was argue, argue, argue.

01:37:12.739 --> 01:37:15.739
It affected their children.

01:37:15.739 --> 01:37:18.739
They decided to separate.

01:37:18.739 --> 01:37:20.739
Finally, I have peace.

01:37:20.739 --> 01:37:22.739
I don't have to be around her.

01:37:22.739 --> 01:37:24.739
Or I don't have to be around him.

01:37:24.739 --> 01:37:27.739
Well, then he realized his relationship

01:37:27.739 --> 01:37:31.739
with Jehovah was being in her fear death here.

01:37:31.739 --> 01:37:34.739
And he went to the elders.

01:37:34.739 --> 01:37:37.739
His prayers were affected, things he noticed.

01:37:37.739 --> 01:37:39.739
He was honest about that.

01:37:39.739 --> 01:37:43.739
And our precious sister was so nice to honestly explain.

01:37:43.739 --> 01:37:45.739
She said, what she learned was,

01:37:45.739 --> 01:37:48.739
this is not about me.

01:37:48.739 --> 01:37:50.739
It's about Jehovah.

01:37:50.739 --> 01:37:53.739
Well, you finally come to that realization

01:37:53.739 --> 01:37:56.739
that Jehovah will strengthen you

01:37:56.739 --> 01:38:01.739
to enjoy peace with your marriage partner.

01:38:01.739 --> 01:38:03.739
Now, the next one,

01:38:03.739 --> 01:38:10.739
I never tire of speaking about this particular couple of verses

01:38:10.739 --> 01:38:14.739
or reading about it or hearing another brother give

01:38:14.739 --> 01:38:16.739
to talk about it.

01:38:16.739 --> 01:38:18.739
See, here's what's coming soon.

01:38:18.739 --> 01:38:20.739
That's here with me,

01:38:20.739 --> 01:38:23.739
chapter 5 and many of you are going,

01:38:23.739 --> 01:38:28.739
oh, yeah, I know what he's going to read about.

01:38:28.739 --> 01:38:32.739
And this is one of the prophecies

01:38:32.739 --> 01:38:35.739
that is yet to be fulfilled.

01:38:35.739 --> 01:38:39.739
So it's just invigorating to know that soon,

01:38:39.739 --> 01:38:41.739
here's what's going to happen.

01:38:41.739 --> 01:38:48.279
First, that's the Loneins, chapter 5, verse 2 and 3.

01:38:48.279 --> 01:38:51.279
For you yourselves know very well

01:38:52.279 --> 01:38:58.279
that Jehovah's Day is coming exactly as a thief in the night.

01:38:58.279 --> 01:39:04.279
Whenever it is that they are saying peace and security,

01:39:04.279 --> 01:39:09.279
then sudden destruction is to be instantly on them,

01:39:09.279 --> 01:39:13.279
just like birth pains on a pregnant woman,

01:39:13.279 --> 01:39:18.279
and they will by no means escape.

01:39:18.279 --> 01:39:21.279
Yes, the Jehovah's Day.

01:39:21.279 --> 01:39:24.279
This has to do with the day,

01:39:24.279 --> 01:39:26.279
the outbreak of the Great Tribulation,

01:39:26.279 --> 01:39:29.279
babble on the Great is destroyed,

01:39:29.279 --> 01:39:32.279
and then Armageddon finishes it off in this context.

01:39:32.279 --> 01:39:35.279
That's Jehovah's Day.

01:39:35.279 --> 01:39:40.279
And what happens before that is this proclamation,

01:39:40.279 --> 01:39:42.279
peace and security.

01:39:42.279 --> 01:39:45.279
Well, religious leaders being involved

01:39:45.279 --> 01:39:48.279
while they're part of Satan's system,

01:39:48.279 --> 01:39:50.279
that's very possible.

01:39:50.279 --> 01:39:51.279
We'll have to wait and see.

01:39:51.279 --> 01:39:55.279
Will it be one announcement or a series of announcements

01:39:55.279 --> 01:39:57.279
that we don't know?

01:39:57.279 --> 01:39:59.279
But this is coming.

01:39:59.279 --> 01:40:03.279
And those that are staying close to Jehovah

01:40:03.279 --> 01:40:07.279
and enjoying the peace from him and his son Jesus

01:40:07.279 --> 01:40:13.279
will not be deceived by this imitation proclamation of peace,

01:40:13.279 --> 01:40:15.279
imitation peace.

01:40:15.279 --> 01:40:20.279
And again, back in Matthew chapter four,

01:40:20.279 --> 01:40:25.279
we're going to see how Jesus handled this type of test

01:40:25.279 --> 01:40:27.279
from the devil.

01:40:27.279 --> 01:40:31.279
And we learn from it here in verses eight through 11,

01:40:31.279 --> 01:40:33.279
Matthew chapter four.

01:40:33.279 --> 01:40:37.850
Again, the devil took him and verse eight,

01:40:37.850 --> 01:40:40.850
took him along to an unusually high mountain,

01:40:40.850 --> 01:40:43.850
and showed him all of the kingdoms of the world,

01:40:43.850 --> 01:40:45.850
and their glory.

01:40:45.850 --> 01:40:47.850
And he said to him,

01:40:47.850 --> 01:40:51.850
all these things I will give you

01:40:51.850 --> 01:40:56.850
if you fall down and do an act of worship to me.

01:40:56.850 --> 01:40:58.850
Then Jesus said to him,

01:40:58.850 --> 01:41:00.850
without hesitation,

01:41:00.850 --> 01:41:02.850
go away, Satan,

01:41:02.850 --> 01:41:04.850
for it is written.

01:41:04.850 --> 01:41:07.850
It is Jehovah your God, you must worship,

01:41:07.850 --> 01:41:09.850
and it is to him alone,

01:41:09.850 --> 01:41:12.850
you must render sacred service.

01:41:12.850 --> 01:41:14.850
Then the devil left him,

01:41:14.850 --> 01:41:16.850
and look, angels came

01:41:16.850 --> 01:41:19.850
and began to minister to him.

01:41:19.850 --> 01:41:21.850
See, right away,

01:41:21.850 --> 01:41:23.850
third time, it is written.

01:41:23.850 --> 01:41:26.850
Jesus was having nothing to do

01:41:26.850 --> 01:41:29.850
with this offer of the kingdoms,

01:41:29.850 --> 01:41:31.850
this imitation peace,

01:41:31.850 --> 01:41:35.850
you'll have all the glory and rule.

01:41:35.850 --> 01:41:38.850
And it's always boggle my mind

01:41:39.850 --> 01:41:42.850
that this one who knew Jesus

01:41:42.850 --> 01:41:45.850
and his prehuman existence

01:41:45.850 --> 01:41:47.850
would have the audacity

01:41:47.850 --> 01:41:50.850
to try to get him to bow down worship him

01:41:50.850 --> 01:41:56.850
shows you if he's obviously insane.

01:41:56.850 --> 01:41:59.850
Now, he wouldn't allow either

01:41:59.850 --> 01:42:02.850
when they tried to make him an earthly king.

01:42:02.850 --> 01:42:05.850
Jesus wasn't having any part of that.

01:42:05.850 --> 01:42:07.850
They were thinking he can bring him peace,

01:42:07.850 --> 01:42:11.850
but Jesus, there's no peace except

01:42:11.850 --> 01:42:13.850
by Jehovah's way.

01:42:13.850 --> 01:42:16.850
And the peace from God's kingdom

01:42:16.850 --> 01:42:18.850
is so superior to anything

01:42:18.850 --> 01:42:20.850
they could try to come up

01:42:20.850 --> 01:42:23.850
with their imitation peace.

01:42:23.850 --> 01:42:28.829
Here's why, think about this.

01:42:28.829 --> 01:42:30.829
Jesus will remove the devil.

01:42:30.829 --> 01:42:36.270
Jesus will remove human rulership.

01:42:36.270 --> 01:42:40.270
Jesus will remove sin.

01:42:40.270 --> 01:42:44.270
So the earth's peace will never again

01:42:44.270 --> 01:42:47.270
be disturbed.

01:42:47.270 --> 01:42:49.270
And I appreciate very much that

01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:52.270
he's going to rid of all problems

01:42:52.270 --> 01:42:56.270
and that includes undoing all causes of pain

01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:59.270
and not just physical pain,

01:42:59.270 --> 01:43:03.270
emotional pain as well.

01:43:03.270 --> 01:43:06.270
Wonderful to look forward to

01:43:06.270 --> 01:43:09.270
that time with that beautiful peace.

01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:11.270
From our precious Father Jehovah

01:43:11.270 --> 01:43:13.270
and His Son Jesus.

01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:16.270
Now, in the following video,

01:43:16.270 --> 01:43:18.270
see what convinced the sister

01:43:18.270 --> 01:43:22.270
not to believe the world's promises

01:43:22.270 --> 01:43:24.270
of peace.

01:43:24.270 --> 01:43:30.079
My Father always taught me

01:43:30.079 --> 01:43:31.079
that we need a God in our life

01:43:31.079 --> 01:43:33.079
in order for there to be peace.

01:43:33.079 --> 01:43:37.859
And He always wanted to know,

01:43:37.859 --> 01:43:40.859
can Christians go to war?

01:43:40.859 --> 01:43:42.859
How is this consistent

01:43:42.859 --> 01:43:46.859
with the gospel of Jesus Christ?

01:43:46.859 --> 01:43:49.859
But the pastor could never give us an answer.

01:43:49.859 --> 01:43:51.859
And so I thought I'd have to look

01:43:51.859 --> 01:43:53.859
to politics to find it.

01:43:53.859 --> 01:43:55.859
A lot of peace movements were being

01:43:55.859 --> 01:43:56.859
formed at that time.

01:43:56.859 --> 01:43:58.859
So I joined one of them.

01:43:58.859 --> 01:44:02.689
We decided where the protest marches

01:44:02.689 --> 01:44:05.689
would be, which pamphlets we would use.

01:44:05.689 --> 01:44:11.729
But after the protests were over,

01:44:11.729 --> 01:44:14.729
everyone was so excited.

01:44:14.729 --> 01:44:16.729
And they all started applauding

01:44:16.729 --> 01:44:18.729
and cheering for the leaders.

01:44:18.729 --> 01:44:21.729
I thought, that's not what I wanted.

01:44:21.729 --> 01:44:23.729
I don't want to honor people.

01:44:23.729 --> 01:44:27.729
I want to have world peace.

01:44:27.729 --> 01:44:29.729
And that still hasn't happened yet.

01:44:29.729 --> 01:44:38.239
Then I started to feel very alone.

01:44:38.239 --> 01:44:40.239
And it made me feel unsafe in this world.

01:44:40.239 --> 01:44:42.239
With no peace in sight,

01:44:42.239 --> 01:44:46.939
I thought, what is the purpose of life?

01:44:46.939 --> 01:44:48.939
While visiting friends for coffee,

01:44:48.939 --> 01:44:52.569
I saw a man I'd never met before.

01:44:52.569 --> 01:44:55.569
My friends told me he wanted to talk to us about the Bible.

01:44:55.569 --> 01:45:00.739
So I asked him,

01:45:00.739 --> 01:45:02.739
sir, what do you think?

01:45:02.739 --> 01:45:05.739
Can Christians join the military?

01:45:05.739 --> 01:45:07.739
And the man said, no, that's not allowed

01:45:07.739 --> 01:45:10.739
because the Bible says you should love your enemy.

01:45:10.739 --> 01:45:16.739
It made me think about what my father always said

01:45:16.739 --> 01:45:23.390
that when he got to bring peace,

01:45:23.390 --> 01:45:25.390
then a really nice lady came to my door

01:45:25.390 --> 01:45:28.390
and she had an orange book in her hand.

01:45:28.390 --> 01:45:31.390
And it said, true peace and security,

01:45:31.390 --> 01:45:39.520
after reading it, I thought, this is it.

01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:42.520
This is the organization that truly wants peace.

01:45:42.520 --> 01:45:50.369
So I went to those involved in the peace movement.

01:45:50.369 --> 01:45:53.369
I told them that I believe that God will change this world

01:45:53.369 --> 01:45:56.369
into a beautiful earth where they'll be true peace.

01:45:56.369 --> 01:46:01.649
They all looked at me like I had lost my mind.

01:46:01.649 --> 01:46:03.649
I was so happy with my new life.

01:46:03.649 --> 01:46:05.649
I felt like I was part of a family

01:46:05.649 --> 01:46:07.649
who truly cared about one another

01:46:07.649 --> 01:46:10.649
and really wanted peace with each other.

01:46:10.649 --> 01:46:19.449
Isaiah 14 verse 7 had a major impact on my life

01:46:19.449 --> 01:46:22.449
because there are God promises,

01:46:22.449 --> 01:46:24.449
a calm and peaceful world.

01:46:24.449 --> 01:46:36.789
Well, wasn't that nice how she learned?

01:46:36.789 --> 01:46:41.789
She looked to politics and protest for a world peace.

01:46:41.789 --> 01:46:45.789
Obviously, she was sincere, but she learned.

01:46:45.789 --> 01:46:48.789
That's all imitation peace.

01:46:48.789 --> 01:46:54.789
True peace and security comes from Jehovah God.

01:46:54.789 --> 01:46:59.789
So wrapping it up with these three different types

01:46:59.789 --> 01:47:03.789
of imitation peace that we've emphasized,

01:47:03.789 --> 01:47:06.789
we want to encourage you in these last minutes

01:47:06.789 --> 01:47:14.789
to safeguard the peace that Jesus has given you.

01:47:14.789 --> 01:47:21.699
In John chapter 14, you know this,

01:47:21.699 --> 01:47:26.699
but I want you to really focus on a particular point

01:47:26.699 --> 01:47:31.399
in verse 6. Jesus said to him,

01:47:31.399 --> 01:47:36.399
I am the way and the truth and the life.

01:47:36.399 --> 01:47:41.399
No one comes to the Father except through me.

01:47:41.399 --> 01:47:44.399
Isn't that beautiful?

01:47:44.399 --> 01:47:47.399
Particularly when I emphasize,

01:47:47.399 --> 01:47:51.810
Jesus is the truth.

01:47:51.810 --> 01:47:53.810
We can trust all of His promises.

01:47:53.810 --> 01:47:57.810
He is the truth.

01:47:57.810 --> 01:47:59.810
He's going to give us peace,

01:47:59.810 --> 01:48:00.810
already has,

01:48:00.810 --> 01:48:04.810
and to a greater extent in the future.

01:48:04.810 --> 01:48:05.810
Yes.

01:48:05.810 --> 01:48:08.810
Our Master is the truth.

01:48:08.810 --> 01:48:11.810
And he gave the early Christians that peace,

01:48:11.810 --> 01:48:13.810
the things that they were able to deal with,

01:48:13.810 --> 01:48:15.810
it's just mind-boggling.

01:48:15.810 --> 01:48:20.810
We read Apostle Paul's experiences and Peters and others.

01:48:20.810 --> 01:48:22.810
The persecution they endured,

01:48:22.810 --> 01:48:23.810
and they did it,

01:48:23.810 --> 01:48:26.810
the enduring with joy.

01:48:26.810 --> 01:48:27.810
It's amazing.

01:48:27.810 --> 01:48:33.810
They can only be a supernatural provision of peace.

01:48:33.810 --> 01:48:35.810
And just to remember,

01:48:35.810 --> 01:48:39.810
Jesus will likewise give you the peace you need now

01:48:39.810 --> 01:48:42.810
to keep doing Jehovah's will.

01:48:42.810 --> 01:48:45.810
And to make him happy.

01:48:45.810 --> 01:48:49.810
So, brothers, please,

01:48:49.810 --> 01:48:52.810
safeguard the gift of peace

01:48:52.810 --> 01:48:56.810
that Jesus has given you.

01:48:56.810 --> 01:49:02.810
Satan uses this world to offer you promises of imitation peace.

01:49:02.810 --> 01:49:06.810
Do not be misled.

01:49:06.810 --> 01:49:11.810
Now, rather, let the peace of the Christ rule in your hearts,

01:49:11.810 --> 01:49:13.810
and show yourselves thankful.

01:49:13.810 --> 01:49:15.810
Yes, through his Son,

01:49:15.810 --> 01:49:20.810
Jehovah bless us all with peace forever.

01:49:20.810 --> 01:49:23.220
Thank you, Brother Morris,

01:49:23.220 --> 01:49:26.220
for strengthening our trust in Jesus' promise

01:49:26.220 --> 01:49:28.220
to give us peace now

01:49:28.220 --> 01:49:32.220
and during the events that will shortly take place.

01:49:32.220 --> 01:49:36.220
The second section of our convention has truly helped us

01:49:36.220 --> 01:49:41.220
to see how Jehovah blesses us with peace.

01:49:41.220 --> 01:49:45.220
What can we look forward to in the next session?

01:49:45.220 --> 01:49:50.220
The scripture theme will be from 2 Peter 3, 14.

01:49:50.220 --> 01:49:55.220
Be found spotless and unblemished and in peace.

01:49:55.220 --> 01:49:58.220
The program will begin with a symposium

01:49:58.220 --> 01:50:01.220
that will help prepare us to share the good news of peace

01:50:01.220 --> 01:50:05.500
at every opportunity.

01:50:05.500 --> 01:50:08.500
Young ones can look forward to a special talk,

01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:13.810
just for them, given by a member of the governing body.

01:50:13.810 --> 01:50:16.810
We'll also see how brothers and sisters

01:50:16.810 --> 01:50:18.810
are maintaining their peace,

01:50:18.810 --> 01:50:20.810
even when suffering from illness,

01:50:20.810 --> 01:50:23.810
economic problems, natural disasters,

01:50:23.810 --> 01:50:26.810
and other difficulties.

01:50:26.810 --> 01:50:30.810
And of course, our next session includes the baptism talk,

01:50:30.810 --> 01:50:33.810
after which those who have been approved

01:50:33.810 --> 01:50:36.810
will be baptized locally.

01:50:36.810 --> 01:50:38.810
We have much to look forward to.

01:50:38.810 --> 01:50:42.380
To conclude today's session,

01:50:42.380 --> 01:50:48.380
let's sing Song No. 112 entitled Jehovah, God of Peace.

01:50:48.380 --> 01:50:51.380
Again, that song No. 112.

01:50:51.380 --> 01:50:53.380
After the song concludes,

01:50:53.380 --> 01:50:56.380
you may have your own closing prayer.
