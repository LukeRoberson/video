WEBVTT

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:13.650
In this part of our symposium, we are addressing why and how to help our Bible students overcome

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.490
unclean habits.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.589
Now, first of all, why overcome unclean habits?

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:28.949
As teachers, we need to reach the heart of those we study with to understand the God-we-worship

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.469
expects this to stop.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.909
Let me show you a verse that you're familiar with many of you, and Peter's letter,

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:45.469
1 Peter chapter 1, and we could use these thoughts here to endeavor to reach the heart

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:51.710
of those we're studying with with why this unclean habit must stop.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:59.549
Let's read verse 14 through 16, as obedient children stop being molded by the desires

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:03.390
you formerly had in your ignorance.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:11.069
But like the holy one who called you, become holy yourselves in all your conduct.

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:17.430
For it is written, you must be holy because I am holy.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:25.409
So it's very clear here, there are things that are Bible studies practiced before, these

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:33.250
unclean habits in their ignorance before they knew Jehovah, before they knew his requirements.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.650
They need to understand he is the holy one, and they have to have their conduct line up

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.769
with the holy one that we worship.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:50.049
And this is not a suggestion as quoting the scripture here in verse 16, it's a must.

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.810
They must be holy because Jehovah is holy.

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:05.129
And the following dramatization, note how Nita helps her Bible student to overcome an unclean habit.

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:30.490
Nita and I talked about her, part of me felt a bit scared, part a bit crazy, me knocking on doors,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.639
but I knew this was the right thing to do.

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:43.680
A minister should also be free from all non-medical use of addictive or mind-altering substances.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.590
Non-medical, but taking something when I'm feeling a little stressed,

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:56.270
like maybe I don't know, a little weed?

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.030
That's okay, right? And it's for the stress.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:11.560
I guess I didn't quite understand what medical men.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.759
So we see you during the week.

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:13.719
Yeah, okay.

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:14.360
Thank you, Jody.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.759
Thanks.

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:18.400
We'll be back.

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:24.319
You can guess what our next few studies were about, and you should continue to be made new

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.639
in your dominant mental attitude.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.560
Knowing it was wrong was easy, figuring out how to cope without it

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:51.610
wasn't beating it, felt impossible.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:04:17.370
Deserve Jehovah felt amazing.

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:29.360
Now next, let's discuss the how to help.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.399
We see how our sister needed,

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:37.279
never to help her Bible student when she became aware of that unclean habit,

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:45.600
but there's some nice thoughts as to how to help our Bible students overcome unclean habits.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.759
Now, we want to be candid and clear from the scriptures, but always remember,

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:55.120
we need to be warm and we need to be

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.600
tackful with them.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.120
These habits have a grip on them and we need to display not a judgmental attitude,

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.439
but patience and really just imitating Jehovah,

00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:11.519
helping them to apply Bible counsel.

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:16.000
Now it's important for the teacher to understand what we're going to share with you next,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.120
and then if you have it clear, you're going to be able to impart it

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.639
to your Bible student.

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:27.759
Let's read a familiar scripture in Ephesians chapter 4,

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:37.680
and it's important to understand what we read here as related to helping them overcome unclean

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.879
habits that go contrary to Bible principles.

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:49.839
Now notice in Ephesians chapter 4, verse 22, 23 and 24.

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:58.000
You were taught to put away the old personality that conforms to your former course of conduct,

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.560
and that has been corrupted according to it, that's the old personality, deceptive desires.

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:11.920
And you should continue to be made new in your dominant mental attitude and should put on

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:19.839
the new personality that was created according to God's will in true righteousness and loyalty.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.319
So, we have to understand this clearly, and then we need to teach our students

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:33.040
there's the old personality. Those of us that came in the truth had old personalities.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:40.240
We know exactly what Paul's writing to the Ephesians about, and that's a former course of conduct,

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:47.759
that is no longer acceptable. But the key to being able to put on the new personality

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:55.759
and put away the old one is found in verse 23, be made new in your dominant mental attitude.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:05.360
So, what's that mean? That means your Bible students thinking has to change.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:13.439
The thinking has to change into this new personality thinking that's guided and directed

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:21.439
by Jehovah and his word. Now, to illustrate what I mean by that, tell you a personal experience

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:29.040
with a Bible study that I had many years ago and really appreciated how Jehovah helped him.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:39.120
Now, when I studied with him, he was 70, early 70s, and he had smoked cigarettes since he was

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:48.800
8 years old. That's phenomenal. I smoked before I became one of Jehovah's witnesses with decades?

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:56.800
No. So, smoking had a grip on him, that old personality that was very discouraging and

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:03.519
difficult for him. However, he was making progress, coming to meetings, and this one

00:08:04.079 --> 00:08:09.199
example that had him with his life will illustrate the point we're making here.

00:08:10.079 --> 00:08:15.680
So, I'm working in a department there at the convention, and it's near the lobby area,

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:22.800
and I notice my Bible study, he heads out and programs ongoing, heads out the door,

00:08:23.439 --> 00:08:29.120
and out of personal interest, not to police him, I want to go see, is he okay?

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.320
So, he's about a block down from the lobby of the convention center, and you know what?

00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:45.279
Smoking a cigarette. So, he notices me come up behind him, and it just hits him, and he's

00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:51.440
contrived. The shame is all in his face, and he throws that cigarette down, stomps it with his shoe.

00:08:52.639 --> 00:08:58.559
So, when I get close to him, he says, I've been asking Jehovah, forgive me, forgive me,

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:04.159
this happens, I always ask him to forgive me, and I said, well, that's commendable,

00:09:04.799 --> 00:09:10.879
that's so important, I know you loved Jehovah. However, here's what you need to learn. See,

00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:21.440
you need to approach Jehovah before, and supplicate him before you take that cigarette.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:27.679
And that's what our Bible students need help. It's important that they have to

00:09:27.679 --> 00:09:36.000
supplicate Jehovah before that unclean habit overwhelms them, and I'm happy to say he did.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:43.840
Turn his back on that, supplicated Jehovah, and boy, imagine smoking all those decades,

00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:53.440
and died a faithful servant of Jehovah God. So, help your Bible students, and keep that in mind,

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.600
they have to change their thinking, and it's our responsibility to make that clear to them.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:05.039
Now, teach them to, by means of practical assistance, be a dear friend for them,

00:10:06.159 --> 00:10:12.559
stay there for them, be available when they need help with something, and just love them, don't be

00:10:12.559 --> 00:10:20.480
judgmental, be supportive, and help them to overcome these unclean habits. And very important,

00:10:20.879 --> 00:10:29.039
teach them, do not give up. Jehovah loves you. He wants you to rejoice in the progress you're making.

00:10:29.679 --> 00:10:37.200
He loves you. And what's your experience when they become a dedicated witness, your fellow

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:47.840
servant of God, you'll have a friend forever. Now, next on our symposium, the final talk,

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:53.759
brother Jeffrey Jackson, remember the governing body is going to consider the talk,

00:10:54.639 --> 00:11:03.759
help your Bible students to develop a personal relationship with Jehovah.
