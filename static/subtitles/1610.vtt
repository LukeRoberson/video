00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:22.660
Well, very good friends of ours decided they wanted to go their own way and leave Jehovah

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.660
and in that interim they became bad association for us.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.659
We had many good times together. We drove to isolated territory together.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:36.659
We even visited a brother who was sick in hospital to encourage him.

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:43.060
I feel heartbroken that they're no longer serving Jehovah.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.060
It's really hard to live a friend's virtually, very hard.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:54.060
I was about to enter full time service, but I still knew the adherence.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:00.060
I was raised by my mother as a witness, even though I had very little contact with my father.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.060
He still tried to oppose my spiritual progress.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.060
I kept fighting for the truth and I got baptized when I was 11.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:15.060
I guess I felt like I was doing okay and after high school I went to university.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.060
I had to make some changes in my choice of entertainment.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.060
We really never stopped learning.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.060
I do enjoy relaxing and watching television.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:36.060
But I must admit that it is more and more difficult to find something decent to watch these days.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.060
Well, I'm not saying that I watch bad programs.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.060
I would never do that.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.060
But still, I wonder if what I watch is spiritually healthy for me.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:59.379
The way of thinking I was exposed to in university was pressuring me to find security in my life through material things.

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:07.400
My government own place to live, economic stability, but at what cost?

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.110
I remember that paragraph.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.110
It said that Satan promotes making money as the only way you could find security in this world.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.110
But one could sacrifice so much to achieve it.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.110
You could even use your friendship with Jehovah.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.110
That article, it was just what we needed.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:37.110
It described a watchman that would protect the city by sounding out an alarm on impending danger.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.110
And at sounding that alarm he would shut the gates to the city to protect the city.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.110
And I needed to do that.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.110
We both needed to do that.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.110
And it's not even a question.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:59.099
Our loyalty to Jehovah comes first before we loyal to any friends we have in this world.

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:07.860
The watchtower said that story telling has more than entertainers.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.860
In Barna, the city of Cameroon, where I was born.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.860
Mother spent the evenings with their children, telling them stories.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:24.860
And even though I was young, the stories my mother told me continued to influence me even today.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.860
So I said to myself, oh no, wait a minute happy.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:36.860
It means that the stories that I watch on television will also affect me sooner or later.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.860
And the devil knows that too.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.860
So I decided to completely cut out a number of programs that I used to watch.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.419
Now I'm serving in full-time service and I love it.

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:53.419
Jehovah is really taking care of me.

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:58.419
But I don't want to forget the beautiful principles I've learned from that article.

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:01.419
I still have to say I've got my heart.

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:05.419
I want to give my best to my father, Jehovah.

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:10.419
A lot of day goes by where we don't think about these friends of ours.

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:13.419
And it's certainly our hope that they come back to Jehovah.

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:16.420
That we can serve Jehovah together, shoulder to shoulder.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.420
But we also learned to keep our little watchguard in check.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:26.420
He needs to make sure he does his job and sand the alarm and shut those gates.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.420
We never stop learning.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.420
Well, true, it's easier said than done, but it's up to us.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.420
It's so important to safeguard your heart.
