00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:09.949
An introduction to the book of Isaiah, Isaiah served as Jehovah's prophet.

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:14.910
He wrote the book, bearing his name while stationed in Jerusalem, the capital of the two tribe

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.629
Kingdom of Judah.

00:00:17.629 --> 00:00:23.609
Isaiah had two sons, sheer Jashib, and may her Shala Hashbaz.

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.070
Their name signified events that would soon affect the Kingdom of Judah.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.670
Isaiah prophesied for at least 46 years during the reigns of Judean kings Azaya, Jotham,

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.710
Ahaz, and Hezekiah.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.030
He completed the book sometime after 732 BCE.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.119
Hosea and Micah recorded their prophecies around the same time.

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:56.240
Some of the events foretold by Isaiah were the fall of the Northern Kingdom of Israel,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.960
which occurred in Isaiah's lifetime.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.239
The destruction of Jerusalem, which happened more than 100 years later.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:11.760
The fall of Babylon, about 200 years after Isaiah's day, and the appearance of the Messiah,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.560
which occurred over 700 years after the prophecy was recorded.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.480
Did you know Isaiah's prophecy about the fall of Babylon foretold details such as how

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.840
the city would fall and even the name of its conqueror, Cyrus?

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.159
The book of Isaiah contains 66 chapters.

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.439
The first six chapters are largely warnings about the calamity that was to come upon Jerusalem

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.439
and Judah for the sinful conduct of their inhabitants.

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:50.959
In chapter 6, Isaiah responds to Jehovah's invitation to be his messenger and shows his

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:57.329
willing spirit with the words, here I am, send me.

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.170
Chapters 7-12 deal with the threat of enemy invasion from the combined forces of Syria

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.730
and the Northern Ten Tribe Kingdom of Israel.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.449
But in fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy, a Syria defeated these two nations, removing

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:14.849
the threat.

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:20.849
Chapters 13-23 include pronouncements against Babylon and other nations for their cruelty

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.090
to God's people.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:32.169
Chapters 24-35 contain messages of desolation and of restoration for Jehovah's people.

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:37.650
Among their acts of unfaithfulness, the people of Judah turned to a Syria for protection

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.129
instead of looking to Jehovah.

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.930
The people of Israel turned to Egypt.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.250
In chapters 36-39, we read about thrilling events that occurred during King Hezekiah's

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.770
reign.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.330
The Assyrian king Sinacarib invades Judah and threatens to destroy Jerusalem if the city

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.849
does not surrender.

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.090
Hezekiah prays to Jehovah for deliverance.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.169
Jehovah reassured Hezekiah that Jerusalem would be safe and then miraculously delivered

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:19.650
his people by sending an angel who destroyed 185,000 Assyrian warriors in just one night.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.810
Despite this deliverance, Judah's sins would eventually lead to Jerusalem's destruction

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.530
and the Jews' exile in Babylon.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:36.250
In chapters 40-66, Jehovah comforts his people and promises to restore true worship to

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.129
Jerusalem after they return from exile.

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:45.889
You will notice that often Isaiah's prophecy focuses on God's kingdom in which the Messiah

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:50.090
rules and restores true worship forever.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.849
Isaiah foretold many details about the Messiah.

00:03:53.849 --> 00:04:00.169
For example, that he would be born of a virgin, come from the family line of David, reside

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:05.560
in Galilee, and cure the sick.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.240
Jesus Christ and His apostles quoted Isaiah's prophecy more than any other to make clear

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.000
the identification of the Messiah.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:23.560
Jesus even read Isaiah 61, 1 and 2 in the synagogue in Nazareth and applied the words to himself.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.560
As you read the book of Isaiah, note how Jehovah's prophetic judgments always come true.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.079
How Jehovah provides salvation for those who trust Him and how the foretold reign of

00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:39.360
the Messiah will bring everlasting peace to the earth.
