00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:12.070
As you listen to Brother Lois discuss the arrangement for Tything and Nazarideship, did you try to make a connection with arrangements that we have for modern day worship?

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.070
Maybe you were wondering, what corresponds to Tything today?

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:30.070
As Brother Lois mentioned, although Tything was a requirement for the Israelites, it also provided Jehovah's people with regular opportunities to demonstrate their love for Jehovah's Day.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:42.070
Of course, we no longer have a fixed amount of our income that we're commanded to give to Jehovah.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:52.070
The Tything arrangement ended with the Mosaic law, and Galatians chapter 6, verse 2, says, we are now under the law of the Christ.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:01:00.070
True Christians today give Jehovah just as they have resolved in their hearts.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:07.069
But the Tything arrangement illustrates something that Jehovah still expects of his people today.

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:16.069
Remember the Tyth was to be not just a tenth, but the best tenth of a person's produce and his animals.

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:21.069
Jehovah deserves nothing less than our very best.

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:26.069
With that in mind, how can we give Jehovah our very best?

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:39.069
Of course, we try hard to obey all of Jehovah's commands, but there is one command that stands out as an identifying mark of true Christians today.

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:40.069
What is it?

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:48.069
Let's read it together on screen at Matthew chapter 28, verses 19 and 20.

00:01:48.069 --> 00:02:03.069
It says, go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:08.069
teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:17.069
And look, I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:23.069
Were you surprised that we read that verse? Of course not.

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:30.069
We see from these verses that the disciple making work is a requirement for all Christians.

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.069
And your dear brothers and sisters have built your lives around that scripture.

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:47.069
You have given and continued to give your very best to obey this life-saving command, and we commend you for that.

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:58.319
Jehovah's organization has always been interested in seeing how this great worldwide work has been progressing.

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:08.319
We enjoy seeing our annual report published each year as we see the number of kingdom publishers increasing.

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:18.319
The worldwide report helps the governing body to see where to send missionaries, special pioneers and pioneers.

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:29.330
Let's watch a video that highlights how Jehovah's people have taken this commission seriously over the years.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:49.120
When did we begin reporting field service activity? Prior to 1920, only coal porters, as pioneers were then called, were asked to submit reports.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:59.979
But beginning in 1920, everyone in the congregation who participated in the witness work was asked to turn in a weekly report.

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:10.060
The 1920 annual service report for the United States was the first to include the activity of congregation publishers.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:21.060
That report revealed that there were 8,052 class workers or publishers and 350 pioneers active in the preaching work.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:29.060
Twice a year during the late 1920s, one week was designated for a special worldwide witnessing campaign.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.060
Pioneers had a goal of 40 hours for that special week.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:45.810
In January 1939, a suggestion was placed before congregation publishers, a goal of 60 hours per month.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:52.810
Early on, congregation field service reports were thorough.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.810
Over the years, the forms used to report publisher's field service activity have been simplified.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:08.810
Reports have consistently included back calls or return visits, Bible studies, publication placements, and hours spent in the disciple making work.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:15.810
As was the case back then, there's always a story behind a field service report.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:22.810
The first time I walked into a kingdom hall, when I was 16, I saw this chart on the stage.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:32.810
And I realized this organization is concerned about what we do, what we say, and how much we say about Jehovah.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:41.810
I realized that from the start, so that after the third month of studying, when I started going out in field service, I wanted to turn my time in too.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.810
And they showed me how to do it, and I've been turning it ever since.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:53.120
Ellen and I were invited into the Special Pioneer Service in 1966.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.120
The monthly requirement was 150 hours and 50 return visits.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.120
It was a good incentive.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:06.120
What we had a quote back then of 150 magazines, one for every hour, a special pioneers or missionaries.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:12.120
And one day we run into our fellow missionary and his wife on the way to the movies.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:20.120
They went every Saturday, every Saturday, but this particular Saturday says, I can't go to the movies because I don't have my 150 magazines.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.120
So I've got five more to go, and then we can go to the movies.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.120
Let's start in 1961, wouldn't it?

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:37.120
We were sent a special pioneer in a trailer of five hours of service every day.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.120
And getting our time was no problem.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:48.120
Living for a month or $100, that was a problem.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.120
So Dave said, I'm going to go out and get a job.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.120
About that time they had put a new store in town, beautiful.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:01.120
He would now do that store and told him, I was going to work one day a week.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.120
What are you going to do the rest of the time?

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:12.120
So he said, well, I knock on doors and tell them about God's kingdom.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:18.120
It's really, this is my door, knock on it.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:23.120
He came in the truth, his wife came in the truth, children are in the truth.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:29.120
And they had a secretary, didn't they? She had seven children.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:35.120
And she said, well, I'd like to study the Bible too.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.120
And we would study with seven after they had supper.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.120
The beauty of it is that they did so well.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:47.120
Yeah, after that, we studied with the parents.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.120
So the time we got through it was probably almost midnight.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.120
And we took our circuit over to you there.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:58.120
And he said, I'm too old for this midnight shift.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:02.120
I never felt it was a question of getting the hours in.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:07.120
I always try to make them quality calls, you know, try to say something with the people.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.120
Not just go there and get the magazines placed.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:15.120
Or my Bible studies, I would try so hard to really get to know the people.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.120
But it was never just a question of getting an hours.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.120
We're trying to save lives.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:28.420
Isn't that wonderful to hear from those dear faithful ones?

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:32.419
And Brother Butel is now 100 years of age.

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:34.419
And Sister Butel is 98.

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:40.419
What a good start on living forever.

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:49.419
As we've seen, the arrangement for reporting our field activity has served a valuable purpose for many years.

00:08:49.419 --> 00:08:54.419
However, as Brother Fleeco mentioned in the opening talk of this symposium,

00:08:55.419 --> 00:09:01.419
Jehovah's people are motivated to praise Jehovah because of our great love for him.

00:09:01.419 --> 00:09:10.419
Sharing in the ministry also reflects our sincere love for our neighbors and our love for the good news.

00:09:10.419 --> 00:09:16.419
So we engage in our ministry not because we feel out of report each month.

00:09:16.419 --> 00:09:23.419
We might say that our ministry is our personal gift to Jehovah and to our neighbors.

00:09:24.419 --> 00:09:27.419
But Jehovah is realistic.

00:09:27.419 --> 00:09:38.419
He knows that many of our brothers and sisters are limited by circumstances, such as advancing age or serious health issues.

00:09:38.419 --> 00:09:47.419
Others cope with the rising cost of living, civil strife, war, or opposition to our work.

00:09:48.419 --> 00:09:56.419
The reason COVID-19 pandemic greatly limited what many of us were able to do in the ministry.

00:09:56.419 --> 00:10:05.419
Some who have preached faithfully for decades may be embarrassed to report little time in the ministry.

00:10:05.419 --> 00:10:13.419
If that is true, you should you feel that you have failed in some way, not at all.

00:10:14.419 --> 00:10:20.419
Note the Principle at 2 Corinthians chapter 8 verse 12.

00:10:20.419 --> 00:10:28.419
For if the readiness is there first, it is especially acceptable according to what a person has,

00:10:28.419 --> 00:10:33.419
not according to what a person does not have.

00:10:33.419 --> 00:10:39.419
If we're giving Jehovah our best, he wants us to rejoice in what we do,

00:10:39.419 --> 00:10:43.419
not to feel guilty about what we cannot do.

00:10:43.419 --> 00:10:49.419
The Scriptures associate sacrifices to Jehovah with joy.

00:10:49.419 --> 00:10:55.419
For example, Nehemiah chapter 12 verse 43 says,

00:10:55.419 --> 00:11:00.419
on that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced,

00:11:00.419 --> 00:11:07.419
for the true God made them rejoice with great joy.

00:11:07.419 --> 00:11:16.419
Can you imagine Jehovah judging an Israelite unfaithful because his 10th was less than another person's 10th?

00:11:16.419 --> 00:11:19.419
Of course not.

00:11:19.419 --> 00:11:22.419
Everyone's circumstances and abilities are different.

00:11:22.419 --> 00:11:28.419
Brother Loesch explained that although tithing was a requirement in ancient Israel,

00:11:28.419 --> 00:11:36.419
Jehovah did not require others to monitor or keep track of each person's tith.

00:11:36.419 --> 00:11:41.419
Tithing was entirely between the individual Israelite and Jehovah.

00:11:41.419 --> 00:11:52.210
The governing body believes this same Principle can be applied when it comes to reporting our time spent in the ministry.

00:11:52.210 --> 00:12:01.190
Our ministry involves much more than counting time for this reason.

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:07.190
We are pleased to announce that beginning November 1st, 2023,

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:18.190
congregation publishers will no longer be asked to report the amount of time they spend in the ministry.

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:27.190
Nor will publishers be asked to report their placements, the videos they show, or their return visits.

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:44.190
Instead, the Field Service Report will simply have a box that will allow each publisher to indicate that he or she shared in any form of the ministry during the month.

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:53.629
There will be one more box where publishers report the number of different Bible studies they conduct.

00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:57.629
This simplified report serves a valuable purpose.

00:12:57.629 --> 00:13:03.629
It will allow us to know the number of active publishers in each land.

00:13:03.629 --> 00:13:10.629
It will also help us to know whether certain territories are producing Bible studies

00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:18.629
and where there is a greater need for pioneers, special pioneers, missionaries, and Kingdom Hall.

00:13:18.629 --> 00:13:24.039
Although publishers will no longer report their time in the ministry,

00:13:25.039 --> 00:13:35.379
we all want to follow faithfully the words of Colossians chapter 3, verses 23 and 24.

00:13:35.379 --> 00:13:45.379
Whatever you are doing, work at at whole soul as for Jehovah and not for men.

00:13:45.379 --> 00:13:54.379
For you know that it is from Jehovah, you will receive the inheritance as a reward.

00:13:54.379 --> 00:13:57.379
Slave for the master, Christ.

00:13:57.379 --> 00:14:08.379
The governing body is confident that you dear ones will continue to render whole soul service to Jehovah by doing all that you can in his service.

00:14:08.379 --> 00:14:22.379
And just as Jehovah richly blessed faithful Israelites who generously supported the tithing arrangement, he will richly bless your sacrifice appraise.

00:14:23.379 --> 00:14:27.379
But wait, what about the Nazarite arrangement?

00:14:27.379 --> 00:14:31.379
Is there a similar provision in the modern day organization?

00:14:31.379 --> 00:14:40.379
Certainly, we all do well to imitate the Nazarites example of self-sacrifice and courage.

00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:51.379
However, as Brother Loesch explained, the Nazarites had to meet certain requirements that were not expected of Israelites in general.

00:14:51.379 --> 00:14:55.379
The same is true of modern day pioneers.

00:14:55.379 --> 00:15:01.379
They have volunteered to devote a certain number of hours to spend in the ministry.

00:15:01.379 --> 00:15:17.379
Thus auxiliary and regular pioneers, special pioneers, missionaries and circuit overseers and their wives will continue to report the number of hours they spend in the ministry.

00:15:18.379 --> 00:15:24.379
Along with the number of different Bible studies they conduct.

00:15:24.379 --> 00:15:40.379
As you know, the governing body recently reduced the hour requirements for auxiliary pioneers, regular pioneers, special pioneers, field missionaries and circuit overseers and their wives.

00:15:40.379 --> 00:15:50.379
It gave us great joy to do that and we are convinced that as a result, even more will be able to join the ranks of the pioneers.

00:15:50.379 --> 00:15:53.379
Why are we so confident of that?

00:15:53.379 --> 00:15:58.379
Because of what it says at Psalm 110, verse 3,

00:15:59.379 --> 00:16:08.379
Your people will offer themselves willingly on the day of your military force.

00:16:08.379 --> 00:16:18.379
Yes, Jehovah promises that his people and young ones in particular would reach out to do more in this time of the end.

00:16:18.379 --> 00:16:23.379
Many pioneers eventually attend the school for kingdom evangelizers.

00:16:23.379 --> 00:16:30.379
They become special pioneers, field missionaries and even circuit overseers with their wives.

00:16:30.379 --> 00:16:37.379
We thank Jehovah for those who reach out to serve as pioneers.

00:16:37.379 --> 00:16:44.379
But let's thank for a moment what this adjustment will mean for all of us.

00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:52.379
Isn't it true that reporting our field service activity each month has served as a reminder?

00:16:52.379 --> 00:17:02.379
Our monthly report reminded us to be regular in the ministry, to use our various publications and videos and to make return visits.

00:17:02.379 --> 00:17:05.380
But what about now?

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:13.380
Will we still be conscientious about having an active share in the ministry each month?

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:22.380
Remember that with the tithing arrangement, each individual was responsible to give their full tie to Jehovah.

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:31.380
Likewise, each of us will want to set personal goals to make sure we have a zealous share in the ministry.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:42.380
Love for Jehovah will move us to have a schedule to make sure the ministry continues to take priority in our lives.

00:17:44.859 --> 00:17:52.859
What will these adjustments in reporting our ministry mean for you elders and the circuit overseers?

00:17:52.859 --> 00:17:59.859
It will be even more important that you brothers be discerning shepherds.

00:17:59.859 --> 00:18:04.859
You will have to know the flock well, for example.

00:18:04.859 --> 00:18:22.859
Evaluating a congregation's spiritual health or a brother's qualifications to serve as an elder or ministerial servant will not simply be a matter of computing averages, time spent in the ministry, literature placements, and so forth.

00:18:22.859 --> 00:18:27.859
No, you will have to know the brothers.

00:18:28.859 --> 00:18:32.859
What is their attitude toward the ministry?

00:18:32.859 --> 00:18:36.859
Are they zealous for pure worship?

00:18:36.859 --> 00:18:40.859
What is their reputation in regard to the ministry?

00:18:40.859 --> 00:18:45.859
Do they take advantage of opportunities to give a witness?

00:18:45.859 --> 00:18:52.460
Do they help others to do so, including the members of their family?

00:18:52.460 --> 00:19:07.460
We have discussed Jehovah clearly deserves our best, and we demonstrate our love for him by exerting ourselves in the ministry and in all other aspects of our worship.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:13.460
Jehovah loves you for that, and we love you for that.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:21.460
We know you will continue to manifest the spirit expressed at Psalm 54 verse 6.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:26.460
It says, I will sacrifice to you willingly.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:33.460
I will praise your name, old Jehovah, for it is good.

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:42.460
So we have no doubt that you will continue to give Jehovah your very best in the disciple making work.
