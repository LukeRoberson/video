00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:08.660
He did not miss the sign the first time but the second time it meant his life. He was Moses.

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:15.939
Our lives are full of signposts, figurative markers for lessons, memories, experiences.

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:22.500
Some good, some bad, some signposts we erect, others are put up for us.

00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:28.820
In either case, they should help us to continue in life successfully.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.740
For instance, consider a lesson, a signpost, in the life of Moses.

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:41.140
It happened shortly after the crossing of the Red Sea, and it is recorded in Exodus chapter 17

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:48.340
at a place called Refidem, the Ezralites gathered, and there was Moses, by a crag, with his staff,

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.659
with a quarreling nation. The events there at Refidem provided a significant lesson for Moses

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:04.260
as something to remember for future circumstances. And so he marked that spa. How did he do it?

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:12.980
He changed the name from Refidem, which meant refresh, to Meraba, which meant quarreling.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.340
Little did Moses know that that name would ring in his ears.

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:26.980
Thirty-nine years later, at a place called Kadesh, Moses was again near a crag with his staff,

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.780
with a quarreling nation before him. And based on the events that happened there,

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.739
look at what is recorded in Numbers chapter 20 verses 12 and 13.

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.420
Numbers chapter 20 verses 12 and 13, we read,

00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:47.620
Jehovah later said to Moses and Aaron,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.659
because you did not show faith in me and sanctify me before the eyes of the people of Israel,

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.019
you will not bring this congregation into the land that I will give them.

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:08.020
These are the waters of Meraba, with the Israelites quarreled with Jehovah, so that he was sanctified

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:15.860
among them. Moses is taught a lesson here. It's unclear who exactly named the place Meraba,

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:23.300
but Moses did record it, that these were the waters of Meraba, an unforgettable signpost in Moses'

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:31.620
life. What it meant to Moses was very clear. So what now? What would Moses do following this?

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.860
Well, from verse 14, if we were to read, we would see that Moses carried on with his assignment,

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.740
he continued to lead the Israelites. He led them against the kings of Sihon and Og,

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.860
he began to see Jehovah's mighty arm of power as they draw closer and closer to the Promised Land,

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:56.819
and in his enthusiasm, Moses makes one request of Jehovah. He turns to him and we can read his words

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:04.659
in Deuteronomy chapter 3 verses 25 and 26. Moses' words in verse 25, he writes,

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.460
Please, let me pass over and see the good land that is across the Jordan, this good mountainous

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:21.860
region, and Lebanon. But Jehovah was still furious with me because of you, and he would not listen

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:30.180
to me. Rather, Jehovah said to me, enough from you, never speak to me again about this matter.

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:40.979
Jehovah was still furious with me because of you, Meraba. That's what Moses is referring to.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:49.379
The signpost was clear from Moses. How would Moses respond to this? What would he do?

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:57.460
Well, Moses carried on. He got back to work, back to business. He wasn't finished. He continued

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:04.500
to lead and shepherd the nation. He prepared Joshua to be his successor, and he worked along until

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:12.180
Jehovah came to Moses and said to him, Moses, it's time to go to the mountain. In other words, it was

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:20.420
time for Moses' death. Read, please, Jehovah's words to Moses in Deuteronomy chapter 32 verses 51 and 52.

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:30.339
Beginning in verse 51 of Deuteronomy 32, we read Jehovah's words, because both of you,

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:39.379
that is, Moses and Aaron, were unfaithful to me, among the Israelites, at the waters of Meraba,

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:45.699
of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zinn, because you did not sanctify me before the people of Israel.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.899
You will see the land from a distance, but you will not enter the land that I am giving to the

00:04:50.899 --> 00:05:02.019
people of Israel. Jehovah draws Moses' attention back to Meraba. What effect did this have on Moses,

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:11.379
that Jehovah referred to Meraba again? Well, think of this. After Jehovah's refusal to reconsider

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:17.379
his judgment on Moses, Moses continued fully dedicated to his assignment. In fact, the details

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:24.899
make up the book of Deuteronomy. If you look at what happened shortly before Jehovah's words here

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:33.459
in chapter 32, we find Moses recited a beautiful song of praise to Jehovah. Following Jehovah's words

00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:40.579
in chapter 33, we find Moses here giving a blessing for the nation of Israel. Do you see what happened

00:05:40.579 --> 00:05:48.980
to Moses? Moses marked the lessons and experiences in his life, like Meraba. He was not paralyzed or

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:56.819
broken by disappointment. Rather, his resolve to serve Jehovah faithfully was strengthened.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:05.459
What helped Moses? How did he do it? Consider at least two things that may have helped Moses.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:15.300
Number one, Moses' intimate friendship with Jehovah. For example, why would Moses even

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:22.980
ask Jehovah to reconsider his judgment on him? Because Moses knew Jehovah intimately. He knew

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:30.259
him to be a God merciful and compassionate and abundant in loving kindness. And when Jehovah

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:41.620
refused to reconsider, Moses did not say a word. Why? Because Moses knew that Jehovah was also a God

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:48.579
perfect in his activity and that all his ways are justice. You see, for Moses' example, we see the more

00:06:48.579 --> 00:06:54.899
intimate our friendship is with Jehovah, the more intimately he can teach us and train us.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:02.180
And thus, like Moses, it will be easier to get past disappointment and continue in our assignment

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:09.379
faithful and joyful. Consider a second thing that may have helped Moses. And that was Job.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:17.459
Remember, Moses wrote the book of Job around 1473, around the same time as the events that

00:07:17.459 --> 00:07:23.860
took place at Maraba of K-dash. The words are fresh in his mind.

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:33.139
Moses knew how Jehovah dealt with Job. For example, at Job 38, verse 3, Jehovah said to Job,

00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:40.579
brace yourself, please, like a man, and I will question you. Moses knew how Job responded

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:48.339
to his problems and to Jehovah's correction. For example, at Job 40, verse 4, Job said to Jehovah,

00:07:48.339 --> 00:07:56.180
I put my hand over my mouth. And Moses also knew the final outcome of the matters with Job.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:04.259
Therefore, Moses was able to see his own difficulties and his own disappointments through the

00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:12.819
prism of universal sovereignty. And that gave Moses perspective. So, take advantage of the

00:08:12.819 --> 00:08:19.379
inspired words of God at your disposal. Meditate deeply on the experiences of Jehovah's faithful

00:08:19.379 --> 00:08:28.740
servants like Job and like Moses. These examples will give you perspective and allow you to move on

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:35.139
joyfully. Brothers and sisters, the simple truth is, in our life of service to God,

00:08:36.259 --> 00:08:44.019
we may be treated unfairly. We will likely be disappointed at times. Our expectations may not be met

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:52.259
and we will respond poorly at times. Mark the moment as a lesson in life, a Maraba.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:09:00.820
And if, as was the case with Moses, Jehovah marks it for you? Be grateful. Do not be paralyzed or

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:08.740
broken by disappointment. Like Moses, fix in mind what you have to do. Allow the experience or

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:17.779
the lesson to strengthen your resolve to serve Jehovah faithfully and joyfully. You can, if you mark

00:09:17.779 --> 00:09:27.779
your Maraba.
