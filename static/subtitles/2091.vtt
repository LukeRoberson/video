00:00:02.319 --> 00:00:06.320
You will be witnesses of me to the most distant part of the earth.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:13.320
Nearly 2,000 years ago, Jesus laid the groundwork for true missionary service.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.320
Since then, how have others answered the call to service a missionary?

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.320
That's the subject of this episode of Our History in Motion.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:33.369
In the first century, Paul, Barnabas, Mark, and others traveled extensively to bring the good news to people

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:36.369
and rejoice as they saw them respond.

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:43.369
Jehovah's people have continued this mission today with the same zeal, tireless dedication and joy.

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:48.369
C.T. Russell and J.F. Rutherford were missionaries themselves.

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:57.369
Both traveled to distant lands such as the Philippines, France, Greece, Egypt, Israel, and India.

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:03.369
Their goal to reach as many as possible with the wonderful kingdom message.

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:08.370
Their fine example led others to reach out and do the same.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:15.370
In 1922, William Har Brown, who had been preaching throughout the Caribbean, wrote to Brother Rutherford.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.370
I have given a witness throughout the majority of the Caribbean islands.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.370
Should I go over them again?

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:28.370
Brother Rutherford's reply, proceed to Sierra Leone, West Africa.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.370
And that's just what he did.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:37.370
Brother Brown and his family served 27 years in West Africa, always emphasizing the importance of the Bible,

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.370
which aptly earned him the name, Bible Brown.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:49.060
When looking back over many decades of faithful service, how did Brother Brown feel?

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:57.060
He said, what a joy it is to see men and women becoming obedient to the good news of God's kingdom.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.060
It is one of the highest privileges that can be offered to a human creature to be an ambassador of Jehovah.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:18.199
In July 1926, George Wright and Edwin Skinner left London on a boat headed to Bombay, India, now known as Mumbai.

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:23.199
There, these brothers set up a small branch office to oversee the preaching work.

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:27.199
To spread the kingdom message, the two brothers would split up.

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:33.199
One traveled deep into the land, while the other stayed back to care for the branch office matters.

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:38.199
By 1938, a great witness had been given all throughout the land.

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:41.199
Twenty-four congregations were established.

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:44.199
Literature was translated and then distributed.

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:51.310
Public meetings were arranged, and the good news was even delivered by radio.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.310
But then came World War II, and in over 50 nations, the work of Jehovah's Witnesses was restricted.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.310
The door appeared to be closing for accepting missionaries in many parts of the earth.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.310
From a human standpoint, it could have seemed wise to pause the missionary work.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.310
But Jehovah knew better.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:20.310
In September 1942, Nathan North, full of faith, proposed the establishment of a school to train missionaries.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:28.310
The first class of the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead began on a winter day in upstate New York in 1943.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.310
And the timing turned out to be just right, as World War II ended.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.310
The door began opening back up, and a global opportunity awaited future missionaries.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.310
Looking back, Gilead has had a huge impact on our worldwide growth.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:52.310
For example, in 1949, Japan reported less than 10 local publishers.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:04:00.310
Shortly thereafter, in 1950, five sisters, graduates of the 11th class of Gilead, arrived in Japan.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.310
Among them was Lois Dyer, another missionary.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:13.310
Over the next 30 years, Lois would travel all throughout Japan, bringing the good news to people that were hungry for it.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:20.310
By 1980, Lois watched the publishers in Japan grow from 12 to over 50,000.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.310
How rewarding.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:30.310
In 2024, some 214,000 publishers preach the good news in Japan.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:38.310
The Gilead has trained over 9,500 zealous kingdom proclaimers assigned to over 200 lands and island groups.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:50.310
I often think about Gilead, the effect that it has now, not only on the field, and those that are going off in the missionary field, but the brothers as a whole.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:57.310
They have gone into these countries, and they have acclimated themselves. They are a part of that country.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.310
They are just as much at home there, those that have been there for a while as the natives.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:10.310
And everyone that has had a part in it, either as a missionary or those of parents that have sent them off, they are never going to forget that.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.310
And I think that is a legacy that will continue forever.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.720
The opportunities for missionary work remain greater than ever.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:25.720
For example, many graduates from the School for Kingdom evangelizers are assigned as field missionaries.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.720
Jehovah is still holding the door wide open.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.720
Hundreds of classes are held each year all around the world.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.720
Have you considered applying?

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:47.720
The exciting adventure of missionary service continues today, as thousands make themselves available in imitation of the greatest missionary, Jesus Christ.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:54.379
See you next time on Our History in Motion.
