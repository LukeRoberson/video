00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.099
Keep on the watch.

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:12.099
That's what Jesus told His disciples after describing the events of the last days.

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.100
How long have you been keeping on the watch?

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.100
We are certainly experiencing critical times hard to deal with.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.100
These are the conditions we have been preaching about for years.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:34.100
In this update, let's review some of the prophecies being fulfilled right before our eyes

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:42.100
and reflect on the timeliness of the November campaign publicizing God's kingdom.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.100
First, think about the sign Jesus gave His disciples.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:58.100
In Luke 21, 11, Jesus said we would see food shortages and pestilences in one place after another.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:07.099
Well, we are now experiencing the fulfillment of this part of the sign in a very pronounced way.

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:13.099
A second prophecy to consider is recorded in Daniel chapter 2.

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:20.099
There, we read about an immense image representing a succession of human kingdoms

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:25.099
from the Babylonian Empire down to today.

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:32.099
The feet and toes at the bottom of that image represent the Anglo-American world power

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:39.099
and Daniel tells us they are partly of iron and partly of clay.

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:45.099
Do you remember what this mix of hard iron and soft clay represents?

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:53.099
The clay pictures, the radical and popular elements within the sphere of the United States and Britain

00:01:53.099 --> 00:02:00.099
that weaken its ability to act with iron-like strength.

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:07.099
Daniel 243 says they will not stick together one to the other.

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:18.759
The watchtower of June 15, 2012 pointed out clear evidence of the iron and clay when it said.

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:26.759
Opposing ideologies and close election results that do not end up in a clear majority

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:37.759
have weakened the power base of even popular leaders so that they have no clear mandate to implement their policies.

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:46.139
Would you agree that this is more evident now than eight years ago when this was published?

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:54.139
Reflecting on the fulfillment of Bible prophecy that we are seeing right now can fortify our faith.

00:02:54.139 --> 00:03:01.139
In the following interview Brother Richard Kelsey, who was baptized in 1941,

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:08.139
shares his thoughts about what's helped him to keep on the watch for some 80 years.

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:17.479
I was baptized in June 1941 in Des Moines, Iowa and at the same time as Peggy,

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:20.479
and we were baptized in a horse-watering tank there.

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:26.479
And this was shortly before the International Convention in St. Louis, Missouri.

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:33.479
We as youngsters and children were all asked to sit in the first rows in front of the stage

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:38.479
and Brother Rutherford gave the talk, Children of the King,

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:42.479
and during this talk at the conclusion, he said,

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:47.479
there's a new book, The Children Book, and you will all get a free copy.

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:52.479
That motivated me greatly, and of course when it was studied later,

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:56.479
that was even a greater motivation to serve Jehovah.

00:03:56.479 --> 00:04:03.479
I started pioneering in September 1948, but I had already auxiliary pioneered,

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:08.479
and of course that wedded my appetite for full-time service.

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:12.479
We see world conditions worsening, and that could frighten us.

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:17.480
It could be that faithful older ones would become discouraged after many years,

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:24.480
and it's very important to have a close relationship with Jehovah, an intimate relationship.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.480
We look forward to his kingdom rule as a solution for all problems.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.480
Young ones will see the faithfulness of the older ones,

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.480
and we want to imitate their faith.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.480
And of course, that's pleasing to Jehovah.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.480
Well, when we heard that there was going to be a special campaign now,

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:51.480
Peggy and I, my wife and I applied for auxiliary pioneer service,

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.480
we have been preaching God's kingdom for many years,

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:01.480
and now there's a special campaign devoted to that subject, God's kingdom,

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.480
and it's going to be a highlight in our many years of service to Jehovah.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:16.819
Like Brother Kelsey, has your confidence in Jehovah's promises been strengthened by what you see happening today?

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:23.819
People around the world realized how unusual it is to have a pandemic,

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:31.819
food shortages, civil unrest, earthquakes, and other disasters all occur at the same time.

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:39.819
Watching the fulfillment of Bible prophecies builds our confidence in other prophecies yet to be fulfilled.

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:45.819
Prophecies that promise permanent relief from the problems we're dealing with.

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:50.819
For example, as Daniel 244 tells us,

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:58.819
soon God's kingdom will become the only government ruling over the earth forever.

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:02.819
Isn't it exciting that amidst these critical times,

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:06.819
we are participating in a special campaign,

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:13.819
clearly pointing people to the only real solution God's kingdom?

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:22.819
Some who are once associated with Jehovah's organization are also recognizing the fulfillment of Bible prophecy

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:25.819
and have been motivated to come back.

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:29.819
If you are inactive or it is fellowshiped,

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:34.819
we encourage you to speak to the elders in your local congregation.

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:37.819
They'll be happy to assist you.

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:44.819
If you'd like a copy of this magazine, please go to our website, jw.org,

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:49.819
and download it, or ask any one of Jehovah's Witnesses for a copy.

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:55.100
Just a few days into the November campaign,

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.100
a sister in France got a call from a telemarketer.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:07.100
Let's listen as Brother Bruno 4 explains how she took advantage of the opportunity to advertise the kingdom.

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:15.670
This experience began when a sister received a call from a telemarketer.

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:22.670
She listened to the saleswoman's offer, but then, instead of simply handing the call,

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:27.670
the sister asked for the woman's opinion on the word's condition.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:35.670
After she responded, the sister had it that these conditions were all faulty by Jesus,

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:40.670
and that deliverance will soon come by means of God's kingdom.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:50.670
The woman showed a real interest and offered to call the sister back with her husband after work to continue the conversation.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:57.670
Well, later the same day, this woman and her husband called back just as promised.

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:04.670
They had a good discussion using the watchdog number two being featured in our campaign,

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:09.670
and they made an appointment to talk again the following day.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:17.670
Sure enough, on the next day, the couple was ready with their own copy of the Bible.

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:24.670
They said that after carefully reading the watchtower, they were touched by John 173

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:28.670
and realized the importance of studying the Bible.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:35.669
They explained that they were originally from Cameroon, and they had become familiar with Jehovah with this,

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:37.669
when living there.

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:45.669
When they consulted www.org, they were touched to see the content available in their mother tongue.

00:08:45.669 --> 00:08:53.669
Now, they were interested in attending a meeting and continuing these Bible discussions,

00:08:53.669 --> 00:08:57.669
so arrangements are being made to follow on the interest.

00:08:57.669 --> 00:09:08.399
Clearly, the zealous efforts of our brothers in France and around the world are resulting in a great witness.

00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:15.399
Many people are surprised to see how quickly things have changed in 2020.

00:09:15.399 --> 00:09:20.399
Just a few months ago, life was very very different.

00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:26.399
This is a very good lesson for us on how fast things can change in the future.

00:09:27.399 --> 00:09:34.399
After saying the words, keep on the watch in Matthew 2442,

00:09:34.399 --> 00:09:43.399
notice what Jesus said about the suddenness of these events that would occur and how we should react.

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:49.399
Matthew 2442-44 says,

00:09:49.399 --> 00:09:56.399
Keep on the watch, therefore, because you do not know on what day your Lord is coming,

00:09:56.399 --> 00:09:59.399
but know one thing.

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:06.399
If the householder had known in what watch the thief was coming, he would have kept awake

00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:10.399
and not allowed his house to be broken into.

00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:17.399
On this account, you too prove yourselves ready, because the Son of Man, Jesus,

00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:22.399
is coming at an hour that you do not think to be it.

00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:31.399
Hasn't the fast-changing world situation heightened your appreciation for the need to prove yourselves ready?

00:10:31.399 --> 00:10:37.399
Rather than allowing distractions to diminish our spiritual alertness,

00:10:37.399 --> 00:10:47.399
now more than ever we need to pray, study, attend meetings, and stay active in the ministry.

00:10:47.399 --> 00:10:55.399
Thank you to all who have worked tirelessly on this kingdom campaign.

00:10:55.399 --> 00:11:00.399
If you haven't participated in the campaign yet, be sure to do so.

00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:10.399
What a privilege it is to advertise the kingdom, the solution to all of mankind's problems.

00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:16.399
By doing so, we can keep on the watch and prove ourselves ready.

00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:26.100
Please be assured of our constant prayers in your behalf and our warmest love.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:33.100
