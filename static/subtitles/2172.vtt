00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:11.279
Why was it difficult to uphold God's moral standards at school?

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:18.660
I remember that in high school, it was complicated because my classmates made fun of me.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.100
They often said I acted holier than thou and other similar insults.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.260
Because I didn't go to nightclubs, I didn't curse, I didn't smoke.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.699
It was unbearable because they often tried to push me to the limit.

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.820
I had a one hour bus ride to get to high school and I wanted the bus to make a U-turn and avoid

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.939
going to high school. I had all the time to think of what could happen to me or they could say to me.

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:42.820
And I admit that I sometimes felt alone.

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:47.969
The environment at school often exposed me to immorality.

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.210
For example, girls would wear short skirts.

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:53.890
I received in some messages from people I had never met before.

00:00:54.689 --> 00:01:00.609
They would send me photos, a phone number, or invitations that it could have just simply accepted.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.129
So I could have easily committed sexual immorality.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.689
Sometimes I felt like I was missing out on something important.

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:13.250
When I heard my classmates talking about what they were doing on their evenings and weekends,

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:19.090
about drinking alcohol, and new drugs they were trying, or girls they had slept with.

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:22.689
I started to become curious.

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:29.099
What did you do to strengthen your faith?

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:36.540
During family worship with my parents, we studied the example of Daniel.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.260
Far from his family, among people that didn't serve Jehovah,

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:46.140
he succeeded in remaining faithful and I wanted to do the same.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.340
To strengthen my faith, I started reading the Bible.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.340
I had to take the Metro to get to school.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.700
So every morning, I took the opportunity to read a few verses.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.299
I thought about the verses I had read.

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:01.579
By praying to Jehovah, having a kind of constant conversation with him,

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.379
Jehovah would put me in a little bubble.

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:08.699
I started feeling comfortable inside, and I was no longer under the bad influence of others.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.819
And the fact I prayed more also made me feel closer to Jehovah.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.259
It was a bit like Psalm 63.7, which describes how Jehovah shelters us under his immense wings.

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:22.780
Well, that's exactly how I felt.

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.139
Prayer allowed me to face any temptation.

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:36.590
Why do you believe that Jehovah standards are beneficial?

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.599
I closely observed the young ones in the world,

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.439
and I realized that they are suffering from the standards they followed.

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:49.520
I closely stick to the moral standards that Jehovah has given me.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.840
I'm aware that they are there for my benefit.

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.719
Because with the experience I've had in school,

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:57.919
I've observed the painful consequences that my classmates have suffered.

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.479
So I'm going to trouble with the law or got sick.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.240
They've had health problems caused by their lifestyle.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.159
A girl in school did something immoral with a boy,

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:13.199
and it started circulating around the school.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.039
Because of that, the girl didn't come to school anymore,

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:19.120
and she started having suicidal thoughts.

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:24.800
I understood that Jehovah protects us with his principles, his standards.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.039
And if I had compromised even once with his standards,

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.080
I would have regretted it sooner or later.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.560
And for me, there's nothing worse than regret.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.199
I'm 100% sure that Jehovah gave me these moral principles for my own good,

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:43.120
so that I could be morally clean.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.000
He also helps me to be positive.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.919
For example, he helped me to see my classmates as potential disciples,

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.879
and we were able to have conversations about the Bible together.

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:56.159
I am really convinced that Jehovah standards are good for me.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.479
Being one of Jehovah's Witnesses is the best life possible.
