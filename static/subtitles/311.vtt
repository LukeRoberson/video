00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:16.100
Hey Gabe!

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.100
Hey Olivia! How's it going?

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.100
Uh, you know, it's going good.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.100
Just doing another letter writing territory.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.100
So, you know how that is.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.100
Okay, well?

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.100
Yay!

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.100
Good to see you!

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.100
Hey Sue, it's good to see you too.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.100
Is that Gabe?

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.100
Oh hey baby, how's that though?

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.100
Hey mom, it's busy but great.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.100
I'm learning a lot.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.100
Oh look who just got home from work!

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.100
Hey Gabe!

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.100
Hey Max!

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.100
So, if it's possible,

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.100
can you send me some more of my things?

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.100
I can text you a list.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.100
Absolutely, I'll get right on it.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.100
Great, thank you so much.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.100
Olivia, I'll let you get back to letter writing.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.100
Great.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.100
Hey!

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.100
Alright, we'll let you go, love you!

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.100
Okay, love you too.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.100
Bye!

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.100
Bye!

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:07.359
So Olivia,

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:09.359
I thought that you enjoyed letter writing.

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:11.359
I don't know.

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:15.359
It just feels like another letter,

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:17.359
another envelope,

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:19.359
another envelope,

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:21.359
and another black hole.

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:22.359
Black hole?

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:24.359
Yeah, you know, stuff goes in,

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:27.359
but nothing ever comes out of it.

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:29.359
It's not that bad.

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:30.359
What do you mean?

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:34.359
You were just telling me that no one's responded to you.

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:35.359
Okay.

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:38.359
Yeah, I get a little antsy for replies.

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:41.359
Like I texted my old classmate Sarah,

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:45.609
but she just hasn't said anything back to me yet.

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:47.609
I just hope I didn't overdo it.

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:48.609
What do you think?

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:52.980
Is it too much?

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.980
Do you think it's too much?

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:01.200
It's too much.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.200
Sure, so, uh...

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.200
Sure, so you get back to you.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:14.460
Alright.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.460
Is everything on Gabe's list?

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.460
Thank you.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.460
At least we'll have a little more room

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.460
for when your mom moves in.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.460
Yeah.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.460
Anyway, Gabe will love this.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.460
He already told me how much he missed his fishing.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:39.189
What if we do something a little different

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:40.189
for family worship this week?

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:41.189
Sure.

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:49.259
So, this is where you and Gabe would fish, right?

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:51.259
Yeah.

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:55.539
We learned a lot of lessons about fishing here.

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:56.539
So lately,

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:59.539
preachings felt like a black hole, right?

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:02.539
We have the right equipment.

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:05.539
But what does a fisherman need more than anything?

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:12.020
Second Corinthians 6'4.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.680
It says, but in every way we recommend ourselves

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.680
as God's ministers by...

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.680
Now, what is verse 6, say, Olivia?

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.680
It says, by purity, by knowledge, by patience.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.680
Patience.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.680
It helps us to keep trying,

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.680
again and again,

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.680
to not give up.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.680
And we're not casting into a black hole,

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.680
but into a blue sea full of deserving ones.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.680
Now, maybe we can't see it,

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.680
but Jehovah knows they're there.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.680
And it may take some time,

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.680
but if we're patient,

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.460
together, we'll find them.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.460
Now, Irene's got some great ideas

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.460
on how to make our letter writing.
