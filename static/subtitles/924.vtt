WEBVTT

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:28.140
We extend a warm welcome to all who accepted an invitation to join us for this convention.

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:34.140
We live in an unfriendly world where true friends are hard to find.

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:39.420
Is it possible to draw close to God and have him as our friend?

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.619
If so, what must we do to gain God's friendship?

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:51.380
Brother Kenneth Cook, a member of the governing body, will answer those questions in the discourse entitled

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.859
Friendship with God. How possible.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.390
Is it realistic to believe that you can be a friend with God?

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:13.510
If until now you've answered no to that question, please consider this.

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:19.829
The lives of millions of people today prove that friendship with God is possible.

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.709
Their lives prove that we can find a peaceful and meaningful life now,

00:01:25.269 --> 00:01:28.790
as well as hope for never lasting and peaceful future.

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:35.590
If you desire that for yourself and others, we urge you to listen to this scriptural talk.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.629
We emphasize the need to listen because many people ignore that important question,

00:01:42.629 --> 00:01:45.989
that is, can you be a friend with God?

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.549
Why is it that many put such an important question out of their mind?

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:57.109
There are a number of reasons. For example, some believe that God is impersonal or unknowable,

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.109
or that He does not exist and that He's not interested in humans.

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.430
They are taught that God is a mystery and that He is cruel, harsh, and demanding.

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:13.990
Many religious leaders claim that God will punish bad people forever in a place of torment.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.990
Do you feel drawn into friendship with a God like that?

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.949
Who in their right mind would?

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:26.710
Still, other people, after seeing all of the injustice and suffering in the world,

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.349
have concluded that God must be dead, or that He never existed at all.

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:36.949
And then there are those who believe that they have done too many bad things in their life

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:39.750
to ever be a friend of God.

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.629
Do any of those causes for doubt or concern apply to you?

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:51.750
If so, please listen carefully to the following four key points that may help you to see

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.550
that friendship with God is truly possible. We will then develop each one.

00:02:57.509 --> 00:03:01.669
First, we'll look at how sin separates us from God.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.509
Second, we'll look at how God has taken the initiative to heal the breach

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:10.870
and bring obedient humans back into friendship with Him.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:18.069
Then, we'll examine what we can do to become God's friend in an everlasting way.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.870
And finally, we will consider how friendship with God brings peace now and in the future.

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:33.669
So, for our first point, what is it that separates us from God in a word sin?

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.389
Why does sin separate us?

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:43.990
Because the true God is holy. He's pure, and his conduct is perfect.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.229
He does not have a trace of sin. He's clean and the highest sense.

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:53.830
No human can be holy to that degree, not even close.

00:03:54.789 --> 00:04:00.389
To illustrate, consider the words human and imperfect. They go together, don't they?

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:04.229
You cannot fully describe humans without mentioning imperfection.

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:10.229
It's just a part of us, and human history shows this to be sadly and painfully true.

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:17.509
So then, our sins or imperfections create a barrier between us and God.

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:25.750
This separation is described at Isaiah chapter 59 and verse 2 where we are told in part.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.990
Your own errors have separated you from your God. Your sins have made him hide his face

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:43.350
from you. Separated from God, it says, we were born into this state, but God did not create us to

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:51.269
be sinful. Our sins are not his fault. The first humans, Adam and Eve, were created perfect,

00:04:51.829 --> 00:04:58.069
but they proved to be ungrateful and selfish, and they rejected God's friendship.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.470
They destroyed their peace with God by sinning against him, and they became his enemies.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:12.149
Adam then passed sin on to his descendants as well as death. We read about this terrible

00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:21.990
inheritance at Romans chapter 5 and verse 12. In this verse, the Apostle Paul summarizes why

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:30.230
inherited sinful condition leads to death. He wrote, that is why just as through one man sin entered

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:39.350
into the world and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because they had all sinned.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:51.509
Death spread to all men. This pandemic of sin has a 100% infection rate and a 100% mortality rate.

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:58.949
No human can escape it. As Paul said, death spread because they had all sinned.

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:06.790
On our own, we cannot correct our sinful state. It's as if we have fallen into a deep pit

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:13.990
with seemingly no way out. But are we left without hope? No. In fact, although God views some

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:21.910
people as his enemies, he treats others as his friends. For example, regarding the man Abraham,

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:28.709
the Bible book of James says in chapter 2 and verse 23, that Abraham put faith in Jehovah,

00:06:29.269 --> 00:06:38.310
and it was counted to him as righteousness, and he came to be called Jehovah's friend. Abraham

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:45.430
was as imperfect as we are, but he came to be called God's friend. What has God done to make it

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:54.470
possible for humans to gain his favor and blessing? Simply put, our Creator has taken the initiative.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:07:00.389
He has taken steps to heal the breach that was caused by sin and to eliminate the separation

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:08.790
between us and him. How has he done this? First, the Holy Scriptures tell us that God desires for

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:14.870
us to come to know him and to be at peace with him. In fact, he appeals to us to do this.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:23.269
In the Bible book of Acts chapter 17 and verse 27, we are told that God wants us to sincerely

00:07:23.269 --> 00:07:29.589
seek him, and that if we do, we will find that he's not far off from each one of us.

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:37.990
Next, and very important, God took the initiative to make this possible by providing the sacrifice of

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:46.709
his Son Jesus in order to redeem us from sin. That was an unparalleled act of love.

00:07:47.829 --> 00:07:54.709
As we now read 1 John chapter 4 and verse 10, please think about what it says regarding this

00:07:54.709 --> 00:08:02.709
matchless act of love on God's part, and so that we may never forget that God took the initiative

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:09.350
to heal the breach, so to speak. 1 John 4 10 says, the love is in this respect,

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:18.790
not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as a propitiatory sacrifice

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:29.110
for our sins. What did God do? God loved us, it says, and he sent his Son. This sacrifice that

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:35.990
God provided by means of his Son is called propitiatory because it can atone for our sins,

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:43.509
and here is how it can do so. What Jesus gave in sacrifice for us was equal to what Adam lost

00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:52.870
for us, that is a perfect human life. Adam exchanged his perfect life for death by his rebellion

00:08:52.870 --> 00:09:00.470
against God. As mentioned earlier, Adam then passed sin onto his descendants, and he placed

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:07.110
this on a path outside of God's friendship. On the other hand, the death of Jesus allowed for

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:13.669
a ransom, or a means to satisfy God's justice so that we could receive back what Adam lost for us.

00:09:14.629 --> 00:09:21.830
That undeserved gift from God was given a great cost, clearly our Creator wants us to come to know

00:09:22.549 --> 00:09:29.830
and to enjoy a beautiful friendship with Him. We should be very grateful that God took the necessary

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:39.350
step to close the gap and provide a way for us to become his friend. The next step involves each of us,

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:48.789
what is required of us, humility. We must be humble enough to accept God's gift. If we are humble,

00:09:48.789 --> 00:09:55.029
we'll see our need for God's mercy, and we'll then do our part to show appreciation.

00:09:55.830 --> 00:10:02.789
The Bible book of Acts, chapter 3, in verse 19 tells us that this involves repenting and

00:10:02.789 --> 00:10:10.549
turning around. In other words, to receive God's gift, which includes his mercy, we must adjust our

00:10:10.549 --> 00:10:17.350
thinking by repenting and then turn around by adjusting our conduct and course in life wherever

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:25.190
necessary. The opportunity to do this is open to all people. As our Creator, God is not partial

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:31.269
in His mercy, and in the friendship He offers. He has kindly put everything in place for us.

00:10:31.909 --> 00:10:37.269
All we must do is be grateful and humble, and then take the next step.

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:46.389
That step involves accepting Jesus and His teachings. God requires that we follow the example of

00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:53.590
His Son. How closely must we do so? At John chapter 14 and verse 6, Jesus explained,

00:10:54.470 --> 00:11:03.750
I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. No one.

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:10.789
So then to come into God's friendship, we must follow His Son as true Christians.

00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:19.830
So far, we have reviewed how sin separated humans from God. Then we considered what God has done to

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:25.990
heal the breach or close the gap so that we can come back into His favor as His friends.

00:11:26.789 --> 00:11:32.230
Now, let's look even further into what we must do, which brings us to the third key point.

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:35.750
How can a person become God's friend?

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:41.750
We invite you to consider what is said at James chapter 4 and verse 8.

00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:48.710
If you have a copy of the Bible, we urge you to follow along. James chapter 4 and verse 8.

00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:58.950
As we read it, please notice first the invitation, then the response, and finally what we must do.

00:11:59.509 --> 00:12:00.470
It reads,

00:12:13.909 --> 00:12:20.950
So first, what is the invitation? It is draw close to God. That is followed by what response on God's

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:28.309
part. He will draw close to you. But for God to do this, what must we do to show that we accept

00:12:28.309 --> 00:12:36.789
His invitation? We must cleanse and purify ourselves according to His standards. This will take effort.

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:43.269
For example, we must learn about His standards, and we must come to appreciate that they are the

00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:51.110
best for us, and then we must be determined to follow them. Above all, we do this because we want to

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:58.950
please God and to be His friend. So then how can you develop a friendship with God, show initiative,

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:05.110
and put forth the effort? Consider this. If you have a house plant, you know that it doesn't grow on

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:11.190
its own. You have to water it regularly and keep it in an environment that helps it to grow. True?

00:13:12.389 --> 00:13:19.190
Something similar is true of our friendship with God. We nurture this friendship by reading and

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:25.350
studying God's Word, the Bible. When we do so, we learn important things about God. For example,

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:33.590
we learn that God's name is Jehovah. And as is true of any good friendship, it's important that we

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:41.509
use His name. If we're sincere in our efforts to draw close to Him, as we read at James chapter 4

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:51.350
verse 8, Jehovah will draw close to us. And He never abandons His true friends. In fact, John 17

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:59.590
verse 3 tells us that coming to know God means everlasting life for us. What an undeserved kindness

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:07.269
and priceless gift for Jehovah's true friends. So that you too can enjoy a bright future as God's

00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:14.470
friends, we warmly invite you to accept a free interactive Bible course offered by Jehovah's

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:23.990
Witnesses using the publication Enjoy Life Forever. Here's what it looks like. Jehovah's Witnesses

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:30.549
can help you to get either a printed or an electronic copy. It begins with the lessons,

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:37.669
how can the Bible help you, the Bible gives hope, and can you trust the Bible?

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:45.669
We urge you to learn these things and to worship God in harmony with the truth that is revealed

00:14:45.669 --> 00:14:52.389
in His Word. So what important points have we considered regarding how a person can become God's

00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:59.909
friend? First, get to know God by reading and studying His Word. Jesus said that doing this means

00:14:59.909 --> 00:15:09.029
everlasting life and then learn about God's name and use it. Now we'll list four more things that

00:15:09.029 --> 00:15:17.350
those who desire to become God's friends must do. They are imitate God's qualities, reject

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:23.029
thinking and actions that offend God, associate with those who want to be God's friends,

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:31.029
and avoid friendship with people who ignore or mock God's standards. Now a few things in that list

00:15:31.029 --> 00:15:36.789
speak for themselves, don't they? Such as associate with those who want to be God's friend and

00:15:36.789 --> 00:15:42.470
avoid friendship with people who ignore or mock God's standards. That makes sense, doesn't it? Think

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:47.909
back to our illustration about the house plant. You must not only water and nurture it,

00:15:48.549 --> 00:15:54.230
but you must keep it in the right environment, one that helps it to grow. Likewise,

00:15:54.230 --> 00:16:00.309
associating with those who also want to be God's friend is the right environment for us.

00:16:01.429 --> 00:16:07.509
But what about the requirement to imitate God's qualities? How can an imperfect people do this?

00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:13.909
Well, for a few minutes, we'll look at just two of God's qualities and how we can imitate Him.

00:16:14.549 --> 00:16:21.909
And we begin with God's love. An important way that we can imitate God's love and become his

00:16:21.909 --> 00:16:29.830
friend is by applying what his son Jesus taught us. For example, Jesus said, just as you want men to

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:37.909
do to you, do the same way to them. A simple statement, but one that takes effort to apply, true.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:45.669
Can we do this? Yes. And a person who desires to be God's friend will put forth the effort needed

00:16:45.669 --> 00:16:53.350
to do this. To succeed in imitating God's love, we must try to see people as Jehovah sees them.

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:58.710
We must try to put ourselves in the place of others so that we can understand their needs,

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:05.910
their concerns, and even their pain of heart. Some may be challenged physically because of injury,

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:12.950
disease, or aging. Others are coping with emotional trials because of depression or anxiety.

00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:19.589
Many people face difficulties that we have not experienced. For instance, a young person may

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:25.349
find it hard to understand older people, and here she will really need to think about what it

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:32.470
must be like to be an older person. If that is true of you, how can you imitate God's love?

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:40.470
One important way is by listening carefully until you understand the other person's feelings.

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:47.430
When you do so, you are in a better position to imitate God's love. Those who desire to

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:54.950
be Jehovah's friends will be moved to imitate his love by acting according to what others really need.

00:17:55.750 --> 00:18:00.710
That brings us to a second and related quality that of kindness.

00:18:01.509 --> 00:18:07.990
Anyone who desires to be God's friend must be kind to others. Here again, we can learn much

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:15.589
from what Jesus said and did. God's son said that the most high is kind toward the unthankful

00:18:15.589 --> 00:18:21.509
and wicked. Jesus appreciated this outstanding quality of his heavenly Father,

00:18:21.509 --> 00:18:26.470
and he imitated God's kindness. What helped Jesus to do so?

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:34.390
He treated people in a kind manner by anticipating how his words and actions might affect their

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:40.630
feelings. For example, the Bible tells us that a woman known to be a sinner approached Jesus,

00:18:41.349 --> 00:18:48.069
weeping and wetting his feet with her tears. Jesus discerned that she was repentant,

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:53.509
and he knew how heartbroken she would be if he just dismissed her unkindly.

00:18:54.390 --> 00:19:01.029
Like his heavenly Father, Jesus looked for the good in her. We know this because he

00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:10.630
commended her, then he forgave her. Following Jesus example, how can we also imitate God's kindness?

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:18.950
We can do so by being gentle to all people whenever possible. Kind people discern how to deal

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:26.710
with delicate situations. Kind people avoid hurting the feelings of others. When we do this,

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:34.950
we try to anticipate how our words and actions might affect them. That is how a true friend of God

00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:41.990
will treat others. Well, this review of just a few of Jehovah's many outstanding qualities

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:48.470
gives us an idea of how much we can benefit from reading the Bible, and then applying its many

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:57.109
lessons for us. Yes, friendship with God is possible, and we can imitate his outstanding qualities.

00:19:57.109 --> 00:20:05.589
In the following video, please take note of how we can use the Bible to build a friendship with God.

00:20:41.559 --> 00:20:50.700
Never known her father. All her life she has been told lies that her father abandoned her,

00:20:55.269 --> 00:21:06.420
but deep inside she feels she knows it's not true. One day, she receives a letter from her father.

00:21:11.339 --> 00:21:17.579
She learns that he is alive, and that unbeknown to her, he had been reaching out to be part of

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:37.529
her life since the day she was born. The daughter learns who her father is, and eventually she finds him.

00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:59.750
They learn about one another and build a strong bond until they are inseparable friends.

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:12.950
The Bible is like a group of letters from our Heavenly Father. As we read the Bible,

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:25.130
we learn how to talk to God, how he responds, and the many ways he shows his tender care.

00:22:29.259 --> 00:22:38.279
The Bible can help us to do something we may never have thought possible. Be God's friend.

00:22:40.119 --> 00:22:45.079
That friendship starts by learning the name of your Heavenly Father and new friend,

00:22:45.799 --> 00:22:56.259
and God tells us his name. You whose name is Jehovah. You alone are the most high.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:08.759
Jehovah guarantees that if you draw close to him, he will draw close to you.

00:23:10.519 --> 00:23:20.539
Our loving father openly extends friendship to all who search for him. Will you accept his invitation?

00:23:26.009 --> 00:23:33.769
To learn more about what the Bible says on this and many other topics, go to JW.org.

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:45.059
As that thought-provoking video asked, do you see the need to come to know your creator?

00:23:46.099 --> 00:23:52.339
Are you willing to put forth the effort needed to accept his invitation and become his friend?

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:57.299
If so, the Bible contains the guidance that you need.

00:23:58.339 --> 00:24:05.940
And the reward for applying what it says is not reserved for the future only. Friendship with God

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:14.180
brings peace now. You can have a more peaceful and meaningful life right now by becoming Jehovah's

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:21.380
friends. When you become a friend of God, he will listen to your prayers and extend his mercy to you,

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:26.500
and when you sense his forgiveness, you will experience deep-seated joy.

00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:29.779
Psalm 32 1 and 2 says in part,

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:37.619
Happy is the one whose transgression is pardoned, whose sin is covered. Happy is the man whom Jehovah

00:24:37.619 --> 00:24:44.900
does not charge with guilt. What a blessing it is to sense Jehovah's forgiveness.

00:24:45.859 --> 00:24:51.859
God's forgiveness can free you from the burden of guilt that you may feel because of past wrongs.

00:24:52.819 --> 00:24:57.940
This includes wrongs that you may have committed before you came to know God and became his friend.

00:24:58.819 --> 00:25:06.180
Is such a thing possible for you? Yes, it is. As our video pointed out, the Bible teaches us how to

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:13.700
pray to God and how God responds to our prayers. And you can be assured that he will listen to your

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:22.259
prayers, including your prayers for his forgiveness and his help. At Proverbs 1529, we read that Jehovah

00:25:22.259 --> 00:25:29.220
hears the prayers of the righteous. Who are the righteous? The righteous are those who strive to

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:36.259
live by his requirements. What a comfort for us to know that we can be God's friend because he

00:25:36.259 --> 00:25:44.420
sees what we are trying to do and he listens to us. But there is more. Our friendship with God can

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:51.299
also result in peace with other people. In fact, Jesus urged us to seek such peace with others.

00:25:52.019 --> 00:25:58.180
He said that we should love even our enemies and do good to others without hoping for anything back.

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:07.380
And then we read at Luke 636 that he added, continue being merciful just as your father is merciful.

00:26:08.819 --> 00:26:15.859
Such a good example can touch the hearts of others and move them to become Jehovah's friends as well.

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:23.539
Consider the experience of Jose, who learned how to love from true friends of God.

00:26:24.339 --> 00:26:31.539
At the age of 13, Jose was involved in guerrilla warfare. He was taught to hate the people who were

00:26:31.539 --> 00:26:38.980
allegedly responsible for the injustices that he saw all around him. His aim was to eliminate those

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:46.099
people. He saw many of his companions fall in death and Jose became filled with feelings of

00:26:46.099 --> 00:26:53.619
bitterness and revenge. While making grenades or bombs he would ask himself, why is there so much

00:26:53.619 --> 00:27:02.579
suffering? If there is a God, does he even notice? Many times, Jose wept. He was depressed and confused.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:08.500
Eventually, Jose came in contact with the local congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:15.619
At his first congregation meeting, he noticed the loving atmosphere there. Everyone greeted him in

00:27:15.619 --> 00:27:23.700
a warm and friendly manner. Later, a discussion on the subject, why does God permit wickedness

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:29.779
provided answers to the very questions that he had been asking? As he learned more from the Bible,

00:27:29.779 --> 00:27:36.420
Jose made changes in his way of life and in his thinking. He learned to imitate God's love

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:42.740
and thereby become his friend. Breaking his ties with his companions, though, proved to be challenging.

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:47.619
Every time you went to the kingdom hall of Jehovah's Witnesses, he was followed.

00:27:48.579 --> 00:27:53.700
Some former associates even attended a few meetings, so asked to understand what brought about

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:59.940
such a great change in Jose. But once they were satisfied that he was not a danger to them,

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:07.940
they left him alone. At age 17, Jose was baptized as one of Jehovah's Witnesses. As God's friend,

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:14.420
Jose soon started sharing what he was learning full-time. Instead of scheming to kill people,

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:22.339
he could now share a message of love and of hope with them. What a great reward for choosing to

00:28:22.339 --> 00:28:29.059
become Jehovah's Friend. Yes, even those who were once enemies can learn to be at peace with one

00:28:29.059 --> 00:28:37.140
another and be God's friends. So what have we learned? We have reviewed why friendship with God

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:44.980
is realistic and possible for us. The Bible tells us that since ancient times, God has called some

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:52.099
humans his friends. We also looked at what God has done to heal the breach or close the gap between

00:28:52.099 --> 00:29:00.819
us and him. How has he done so? By means of his Son. Through Jesus, Jehovah God provided the

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:07.700
ransom sacrifice that was needed to redeem us from sin. Then we looked at what you must do to take

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:14.900
advantage of God's mercy and become his friend. This includes studying his word the Bible and then

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:22.660
imitating his outstanding qualities. Finally, we considered how you can find a meaningful life now

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:30.740
as well as true peace with others. Jehovah promises that his friends will receive

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:40.180
eternal life in peace. If that is what you yearn for, then please accept our invitation to study

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:47.619
the Bible with Jehovah's Witnesses. By doing so, you will learn about an unending future when

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:55.140
anguish of heart is gone forever and an unending future in which God will permanently wipe away

00:29:55.140 --> 00:30:04.660
tears from the faces of his friends. That future is not only possible, it is the future that God

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:12.779
promises. Thank you, Brother Cook, for helping us to see how friendship with God leads to

00:30:12.779 --> 00:30:20.569
genuine peace. Around the earth, millions are pursuing peace and building faith in Jehovah God

00:30:20.569 --> 00:30:26.569
and his word the Bible. If you would like to have Bible discussions free of charge at the time

00:30:26.569 --> 00:30:35.289
and place convenient for you, please inform one of Jehovah's Witnesses or visit jw.org and fill out

00:30:35.289 --> 00:30:40.970
an online request for a Bible study. We will be happy to arrange for one of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:48.009
to assist you. Additionally, you can find interactive self-guided Bible study lessons on our

00:30:48.009 --> 00:30:56.819
website, jw.org. We have reached the conclusion of this session. We look forward to the next session

00:30:56.819 --> 00:31:04.099
in which we will see part two of our future Bible drama, Jehovah guides us in the way of peace.

00:31:04.099 --> 00:31:10.339
And we will hear the final talk of this convention. Now, let's sing a song that expresses our

00:31:10.339 --> 00:31:19.700
confidence in God's promises. We invite you to sing song number 147 entitled Live Everlasting

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:36.500
is Promised. That song number 147, after which you may have your local concluding prayer.
