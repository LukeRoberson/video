00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:09.619
The earth has more than 350,000 species of flowering plants.

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:17.670
Flowers serve practical needs.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:27.429
Flowers make pollen in order to reproduce and nectar for creatures that spread pollen.

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:35.429
Pollination produces nutritious seeds, fruits and vegetables.

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:40.429
The beautiful flower we see may look like this to a bee.

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:47.429
Some flowers reflect ultraviolet light in ways that create a hard-to-miss target.

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:53.579
We enjoy more than the flowers' beauty and aroma.

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.579
Yet some plants do not need beautiful flowers to reproduce.

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.579
Flowers, pollen, nectar and aromas are costly for plants to produce.

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:11.579
Those resources could be used for other purposes.

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:16.579
Yet plants make flowers in breathtaking abundance.

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:35.780
The hover generously created flowers in a way that brings us joy

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.780
and reminds us to trust him when we are anxious.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.829
Take a lesson from the lilies of the field.

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:49.829
How they grow, they do not toil nor do they spin.

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.829
But not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these.

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:09.590
Our tongue can detect five basic tastes.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:30.270
There is sweet, salty, sour, bitter and the rich savoury taste called umami.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:39.610
But we enjoy not just five flavors, but possibly over a hundred thousand.

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:44.229
How?

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:50.090
As we chew, we also smell our food.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:57.090
Chewing releases aromas that pass up into our nose through the back of our throat.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:11.180
Taste and smell then combine to make the flavors we enjoy.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.180
Our taste buds develop before we're born.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:23.379
As an unborn baby swallows amniotic fluid, it may taste what its mother eats.

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:30.000
And is more likely to enjoy the same food she does.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.310
We don't eat just to survive.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.310
We love to eat.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.310
It makes us happy.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:46.080
The Bible says why?

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:55.860
That everyone should eat and drink and find enjoyment for all his hard work.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:06.990
It is the gift of God.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.319
What is color?

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.319
It's how we perceive wavelengths of light.

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:26.180
Objects that reflect all wavelengths of visible light appear white.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:34.029
When an object reflects only some wavelengths, we see color.

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:40.029
Cells in our eye detect light and send signals to our brain.

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:45.029
We have three kinds of color sensing cells.

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:54.420
Those that detect red, green and blue.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.420
How do we perceive other colors?

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:07.689
Mixing red, green and blue light changes the color we see.

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:14.689
This flower is yellow because it reflects red and green light into our eye.

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:21.689
With just three kinds of color receptors, we can distinguish some 10 million colors.

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:28.629
Color triggers our emotions.

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:32.629
Blue and green can calm us.

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:36.629
Red and orange can excite.

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:41.629
In the Bible, descriptions that include color help us learn.

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:51.060
Is there any doubt that God gave us the gift of color for our joy?

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.060
I put my rainbow in the cloud.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:08.699
And it will serve as a sign of the covenant between me and the earth.

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:17.579
Our bodies are designed to move.

00:06:17.579 --> 00:06:24.399
The way we move can be complex or precise.

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:34.670
It could require strength or stamina.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:45.529
King involves the coordination of dozens of muscles.

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:49.529
Muscles are controlled by our brain and nervous system.

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:57.779
They support and move our bones, now powered by the food we eat and the oxygen we breathe.

00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:05.420
Everybody part is a marvel of engineering.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:16.569
The knee is designed to withstand repeated impact,

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:23.360
surrounding tissue cushions and aligns it.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.360
Finding suggests that regular movement helps prevent joint damage.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:35.980
The body is a machine that strengthens as we use it.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:42.480
Movement helps us to stay healthy and feel good.

00:07:45.819 --> 00:07:49.819
The body is a credit to its creator.

00:07:49.819 --> 00:08:11.060
For by him, we have life and move and exist.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:24.779
Our world is full of sounds.

00:08:24.779 --> 00:08:31.550
Some are natural.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.549
Others we create.

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:40.210
We can hear music before we're born.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:44.210
And can develop a love of music as we grow.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:48.970
We can compose music.

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.970
Be moved by it.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.970
And replay it in our minds.

00:08:54.970 --> 00:09:00.970
Musical instruments typically combine a sound generator which produces tones

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:05.970
with a resonator such as wood or metal which adds volume.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:09.970
The design resembles our own vocal organs.

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:18.379
But few instruments compare to the beauty of the human voice.

00:09:18.379 --> 00:09:21.379
Our hearing complements the voice.

00:09:21.379 --> 00:09:27.870
We can listen to things that draw us closer to God

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:35.309
and use the voice he gave us to praise him with joy.

00:09:35.309 --> 00:09:39.309
Praise Ja for Jehovah is good.

00:09:39.309 --> 00:09:44.309
Sing praises to his name for it is pleasant.

00:09:44.309 --> 00:09:57.720
Animals fascinate us.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:12.379
We marvel at their speed, their agility and their strength.

00:10:12.379 --> 00:10:16.379
Their beauty and behavior are a pleasure to watch.

00:10:16.379 --> 00:10:26.610
Like us, they play.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:28.610
Some even dance.

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:35.789
They are industrious.

00:10:35.789 --> 00:10:42.129
A beaver dam can extend hundreds of meters.

00:10:42.129 --> 00:10:45.129
Some can even be seen from space.

00:10:45.129 --> 00:10:51.379
When we observe animals, we learn more about the creator.

00:10:51.379 --> 00:11:01.559
Their instinctive wisdom reveals his wisdom.

00:11:01.559 --> 00:11:06.559
He is caring and generous.

00:11:06.559 --> 00:11:11.769
And he is a happy God.

00:11:11.769 --> 00:11:18.559
Animals fascinate us because we are made in God's image.

00:11:18.559 --> 00:11:21.559
We enjoy what he enjoys.

00:11:21.559 --> 00:11:26.559
Especially our earth and its amazing animals.

00:11:26.559 --> 00:11:29.559
They are his gift to us.

00:11:29.559 --> 00:11:35.559
Let us make man in our image according to our likeness.

00:11:35.559 --> 00:11:38.559
And let them have in subjection the fish of the sea

00:11:38.559 --> 00:11:41.559
and the flying creatures of the heavens

00:11:41.559 --> 00:11:45.559
and the domestic animals and all the earth.
