00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:23.589
Transfusional behaviors have radically changed and there has been a distinct shift towards

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:30.429
less transfusion and not just in regard of weightlessness, patience of course, but all

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:36.909
the world because there is increasing evidence that reduced transfusions means better outcome.

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:47.530
It's a matter of education. I think this sort of event, this sort of interview even has

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.810
the meaning of spreading evidence and knowledge that the transfusion is not necessary and

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.929
when possible should be avoided. So it's not unusual to come back after a very complex

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:03.649
operation, after having struggled not to transfuse during the operation, just discovering

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.609
that the patient has been transfused to two blood units during now by the shift anesthesiologist

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:15.409
just because it was sort of empty. So I picked the two blood units and gave you. This is

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:23.170
something we are really trying to avoid, but it's a matter of education. Unfortunately, I've

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:30.290
perceived that the transfusion rate dramatically increases with the decrease of the professionalism.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.099
We apply everything we know all together with the patients to younger patients, but I have to

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:48.859
say that the resources of a young body are really magic. So they can withstand low level of

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:54.299
amalgamant without problem and they are so faster in recovery than the age of patients. So

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:06.980
it's not much of a problem nowadays. Yes, absolutely. Witnesses, patients do care about

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.979
lifelike and do love lifelike. Any other patient is just that they prefer to avoid transfusion

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:14.580
and this must be respected.
