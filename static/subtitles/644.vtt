00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.900
There's a common saying today that is popular in the world.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.539
Just follow your heart.

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:20.460
It sounds so sweet, so agreeable, so innocent, but it's not, it's stupid.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.780
To blindly follow your heart, which really means to follow your feelings, your emotions

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:34.579
and leave Jehovah out of the picture is precisely what Proverbs 28, 26 is referring to.

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:43.619
It reads, He that is trusting in His own heart is stupid, but then it adds this interesting

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:45.140
thought.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:52.259
It says, but He that is walking in wisdom is the one that will escape.

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:54.539
Escape what?

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.820
We escape from being guided by a treacherous heart.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.899
That's the point.

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.340
Our feelings, our emotions.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:14.819
It says Jeremiah 179 says, the heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate.

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:20.739
We realize that the stupid in the Bible doesn't mean that a person is ignorant.

00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:26.540
It really applies to a person who doesn't listen to Jehovah and follow His ways.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.099
Well, the earth today is filled with people who meet that definition.

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:36.980
They don't listen to Jehovah, they don't follow His ways, and so what the Bible says about

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.299
them is true.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.420
But they can change.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.060
Some of us have.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.659
We walked in the past, perhaps according to our own heart, but we listened to the truth

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.299
and now Jehovah God is guiding us.

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.980
Notice what Psalm 49, 10 through 13 says about such people.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:04.340
Psalm 49, 10 through 13, those who walk according to their own heart.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.860
It reads, He Jehovah sees that even wise people die.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:17.419
The stupid and the unreasonable perish together, and they must leave their wealth to others.

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:21.699
Their inner wish is that their houses will last forever.

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:25.659
Their tents to generation after generation.

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:30.379
They have named their estates after themselves.

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:37.259
But man, although honored, will not remain, he is no better than the beasts that perish.

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:45.379
This is the way of the stupid ones and of those who follow them who take pleasure in their

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.379
empty words.

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:56.139
Yes, how many people today take pleasure in empty words and follow them everywhere?

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:01.460
Men make all kinds of promises about the future and things they're going to accomplish.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.819
They're empty words because they don't take Jehovah God into account.

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:12.500
And what about the teachings at colleges and universities around the world?

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.819
There are many empty words by those instructors, especially those who deny God's existence

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:24.979
and latch on to the fantasy of evolution.

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:27.620
Ephesians 5.6 says this,

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.139
Let no man deceive you with empty words.

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:40.379
For because of such things, the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience.

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:47.060
Although there are a lot of empty words about the origin of man, that some kind of ape

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.699
is our long-lost ancestor, those truly are empty words, that everything that we see

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:59.060
around us just came about by chance, that somehow in some miraculous way unintelligence

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.900
produced intelligence.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:09.539
I found this interesting observation, actually it's a very amusing observation, in the awake

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:14.419
of April the 8th, 1955, page 6.

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:20.500
The article was considering the belief that rare and large mutations occurred, perhaps

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:27.339
during the Cambrian period, where no intermediate fossils are found of life transitioning from

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:30.220
one kind to another kind.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.819
And this is what the article said.

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:44.740
Suppose that very big rare mutations occurred, involved in forming a new life, and

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:52.379
suppose thousands of years ago an ape gave birth to a male human baby.

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:56.500
This impossible mutation is not enough.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.980
What good is one human?

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:05.459
So this fantastic mutation must happen to another ape mother, only different.

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:12.339
It must be a female human baby, an exact physical and genetic counterpart.

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:14.500
That's not enough.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:21.259
These two fantastic rarities must happen to two apes that live at the same time, so the

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:26.579
humans can mature together and be the right age for each other.

00:05:26.579 --> 00:05:28.579
Nor is that enough.

00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:36.540
These two unbelievable events must occur to ape mothers living in the same jungle area,

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.540
so that their human offspring will meet and cohabit.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:47.100
If you think this is distorted, the article goes on to say, because it gets the human

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.939
baby in one step, you're right.

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:57.980
But it's easier to have this impossible series of events happen once, than three times,

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:04.779
for many times, depending on the number of steps necessary to get from ape to man.

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:11.860
It is sheer stupidity to think all these factors would be present in one step, and I might

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.019
add evolutionists would undoubtedly feel the same way, at least most of them would.

00:06:17.019 --> 00:06:23.620
But to think they are present over and over and over again for many steps as evolutionists

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:30.100
must contend is sheer stupidity multiplied many times over.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:38.579
Now, those who believe or support the theory of evolution are not ignorant people, except

00:06:38.579 --> 00:06:40.699
in one area.

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:46.860
They don't believe in God, and really their big problem is they lack faith.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:54.819
Many evolutionists make the mistake of judging God and the Bible by the churches and their

00:06:54.819 --> 00:07:02.579
ridiculous teachings, and there are some evolutionists who are just devoid of faith.

00:07:02.579 --> 00:07:10.019
But what they teach, all of them what they teach in connection with evolution, is really

00:07:10.019 --> 00:07:15.420
suppressing the truth and misleading millions.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:22.500
The Apostle Paul wrote about that, Romans chapter 1 verses 18 through 20.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.579
This is what it says, Romans 118 through 20.

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:35.500
For God's wrath is being revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:40.540
of men who are suppressing the truth in an unrighteous way.

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:47.660
Well, that's precisely what this teaching about evolution or the theory of God doesn't

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.100
exist, the atheist who have embraced that.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:58.139
And then it goes on, it says, because what may be known about God is clearly evident among

00:07:58.139 --> 00:07:59.420
them.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:06.620
For God made it clear to them, yes, how, well, it goes on to tell us how, for his invisible

00:08:06.699 --> 00:08:13.100
qualities are clearly seen from the world's creation onward, because they are perceived

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:19.500
by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship, so that they, those who don't

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.420
believe, are inexcusable.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.300
And that's the truth of the matter.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.420
They are inexcusable.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:34.980
The teaching of evolution has caused great heartache and much confusion throughout the

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:45.899
earth, no God, no purpose in life, you're just an animal, no God, no male or female,

00:08:45.899 --> 00:08:53.700
no marriage, it really doesn't matter what you do with your life, no God, no divine

00:08:53.700 --> 00:09:04.940
laws, no rules for us to live by, no God, no hope, how sad, all because they trust

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:11.539
their heart and they pay attention to empty things.

00:09:11.539 --> 00:09:19.580
How grateful we are to know the truth, to exercise faith in our loving God, Jehovah,

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:24.460
and to put our full trust in God's Word, the Bible.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:31.259
Indeed, we praise Jehovah for who He is, the Creator, and we do not pay attention to

00:09:31.259 --> 00:09:32.700
empty words.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:39.340
We listen to His Word that is inspired by Him and that guides us in the pathway to life.
