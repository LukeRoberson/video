WEBVTT

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:09.640
Jehovah's been so good to us.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:28.530
We enjoy a busy life full of blessings.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:44.109
Including one, we didn't expect.

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:47.109
We love our little Emma so much.

00:00:47.109 --> 00:01:20.329
But childry rain was harder than we thought.

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:26.549
Most days went well.

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:36.909
Others not so much.

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.909
I just need some rest.

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.909
When will things be back to normal?

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.909
I wake with every little cry.

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.909
I wake when she's silent.

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.219
Am I doing this right?

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:57.730
I should check on them.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.730
Anytime to ourselves was time to do nothing.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.730
Fatigue was affecting our relationship with Jehovah.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.729
And each other.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:26.719
We were so relieved when David, a father himself,

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:29.719
offered to visit with another elder.

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:35.500
We read Isaiah 4029.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.939
He gives power to the tired one,

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:44.939
and full might to those lacking strength.

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:49.939
As a loving father, Jehovah wants parents to succeed.

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:53.939
So he gives us what we need to recharge us.

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.939
Things might never be like they were before.

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:02.939
But his suggestions helped us create a practical and consistent spiritual routine.

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:06.939
David said it's normal for new parents to feel anxious,

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.939
and anxiety is tiring.

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:12.939
So we pray for a calm heart.

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:16.939
An extra kindness went tired.

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:30.539
So we can keep working as a team.

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:33.539
I so appreciate Zach's help.

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:56.439
And I'm sacrificing some unnecessary things to put spiritual things first.

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:02.219
There will always be a lot to do.

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:15.620
But when Emma sleeps, I feed my faith and rest.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.620
Our new spiritual routine is invigorating.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:50.899
Jehovah helped us to understand.

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:54.899
While life in this system may have many challenges,

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:59.899
putting spiritual things first will give us the strength to meet them.
