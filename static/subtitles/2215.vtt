WEBVTT

00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:25.120
My king.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.120
General.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.120
We starve them out.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.120
But you're how you can still live.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.119
Negotiations don't concern your general.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.899
And competence does.

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.899
Finish it!

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.899
You'll not find me as forgiving as the gods.

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:42.899
Yes, my king.

00:00:42.899 --> 00:01:02.060
But if Army says,

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.060
because you did not obey my words,

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.060
all this land will be reduced to ruins.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.060
And this land and its inhabitants

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.060
will have to serve the King of Babylon for 70 years.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:25.030
Where have you been?

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.030
It's on the sundown.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.030
Sorry.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.030
Jeremiah was speaking today.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.030
And I stopped by the temple on the way home.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.030
Well, we're almost ready.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:50.939
You're at the temple again today.

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.939
I was.

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.939
To gaze upon the pleasantness of Jehovah.

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.939
And to look with appreciation upon his temple.

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.780
I have something for you.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:19.020
So you can always have Jehovah's words with you.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.020
Thank you, Papa.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:29.120
What's wrong?

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.819
What's going to happen to us?

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:41.460
What always happens to Jehovah's faithful servants?

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.460
Have no fear.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.460
Jehovah is our shield.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:03:20.870
Let's sing.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.870
Son, pick a song.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.870
Jehovah is my light in my salvation.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.870
You always choose someone.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.900
Who's him?

00:03:33.900 --> 00:04:32.759
I've got to go with Papa.

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:35.620
I know, Zark.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.620
Sure.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.620
And who will you be?

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.310
I'll be alive.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:05:11.750
There are things we have to go.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:19.319
We don't live here anymore.

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:24.160
Who's him?

00:05:24.160 --> 00:07:17.029
Grab our bags.

00:07:17.029 --> 00:08:06.699
What's going on?

00:08:06.699 --> 00:08:15.620
Of the tribe of Judah, you will receive training in the house

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.620
of the great king, Nebuchadnezzar.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.620
But this is my family.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.620
Prince's and Noble's belonging the power.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:27.639
He's not a prince.

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:28.639
He's just a boy.

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:36.389
I will go.

00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:37.389
If it's a servant, you see.

00:08:37.389 --> 00:08:38.389
No.

00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:39.389
I'm taking the boy.

00:08:39.389 --> 00:08:41.740
Daniel.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:42.740
Wait.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:49.120
Can we say goodbye?

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.120
Make it quick.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:09:08.340
Be strong, my son.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.850
Ola is with you.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:10:19.529
Michelle.

00:10:19.529 --> 00:10:21.840
Have you seen anyone else?

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.840
You didn't think we let you come here alone, did you?

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.840
That's right.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:26.840
In Anaya.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.220
Is this kids' wife in the house?

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:31.220
Nice to meet you.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:41.820
Joseph?

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:42.820
In Caros house?

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.820
No, like Joseph in the dungeon.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.820
Doesn't seem so bad to me.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:54.629
You don't say something.

00:10:54.629 --> 00:12:15.620
You have been chosen because you were wise.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:20.720
But you are lacking.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:25.610
You will learn our writing.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:27.610
And our language.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:36.909
You will be given new names.

00:12:36.909 --> 00:12:39.909
And at the end of three years,

00:12:39.909 --> 00:12:42.909
you will serve the great king, Nebuchadnezzar.

00:12:42.909 --> 00:12:50.070
Today, you are foreigners.

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:58.679
Tomorrow, the gods willing.

00:12:58.679 --> 00:13:00.679
Avalonians.

00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:43.379
Meshach.

00:13:43.379 --> 00:13:45.379
You look like a Meshach.

00:13:45.379 --> 00:13:50.840
My new names sound like their gods.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.840
New names, new language.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.840
Soon they want us to worship their gods.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.840
Calm down.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:58.840
My father had idols.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.840
And he worshiped Jehovah.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.840
Did you see the same city I did?

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.840
It's the center of the world.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:12.049
We'll even eat from the king's table.

00:14:12.049 --> 00:14:19.389
What do Babylonians eat?

00:14:19.389 --> 00:14:22.389
His servants are given only the best.

00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:38.500
Is there a problem?

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:47.690
Our God doesn't allow us to eat such foods.

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:54.419
Do you feel your God?

00:14:54.419 --> 00:14:56.419
I do.

00:14:56.419 --> 00:15:02.419
Well, I am afraid of my Lord the King.

00:15:02.419 --> 00:15:05.419
Who has assigned your food and drink?

00:15:05.419 --> 00:15:11.149
He insists on these selections

00:15:11.149 --> 00:15:14.149
to maintain your strength and vitality.

00:15:14.149 --> 00:15:20.360
What if he should see you looking worse than appearance

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:30.149
than the other youths who would make me guilty before the king?

00:15:30.149 --> 00:15:33.399
I must obey the king.

00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:34.399
So much to you.

00:15:34.399 --> 00:15:45.139
When dinner is served,

00:15:45.139 --> 00:15:47.139
I expect you to be hungry.

00:15:47.139 --> 00:16:11.759
You don't speak for us.

00:16:11.759 --> 00:16:16.769
You're right.

00:16:16.769 --> 00:16:17.769
You can make your own choice.

00:16:17.769 --> 00:16:19.769
Didn't you hear him?

00:16:19.769 --> 00:16:21.769
We don't have a choice.

00:16:21.769 --> 00:16:23.769
It's a new land with new laws.

00:16:23.769 --> 00:16:29.559
So what if some of the food is unblood?

00:16:29.559 --> 00:16:31.559
It's just food.

00:16:31.559 --> 00:16:33.559
But Jehovah commanded us not to eat blood.

00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:37.860
It's your interpretation.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:40.860
You must not eat any blood at all.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.860
What's too interpretant that?

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:44.860
Maybe we should all take a moment and pray.

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:46.860
Pray.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:47.860
Here.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:52.370
What's the point?

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:54.370
Jehovah's in Israel.

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:57.370
We're in Babylon now.

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:59.370
Don't you believe Jehovah's here too?

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:06.539
Jehovah said that we're his witnesses.

00:17:06.539 --> 00:17:08.539
What will people say about Jehovah

00:17:08.539 --> 00:17:11.539
if we give in and break his laws?

00:17:11.539 --> 00:17:37.470
Your meal is ready.

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:38.470
Did you hear me?

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:43.259
Thank you.

00:17:43.259 --> 00:17:44.259
But if we eat those foods,

00:17:44.259 --> 00:17:47.259
we'll disobey our God.

00:17:47.259 --> 00:17:50.819
You want to starve?

00:17:50.819 --> 00:17:52.819
No, of course not.

00:17:52.819 --> 00:17:54.819
But he forbids us from eating blood

00:17:54.819 --> 00:17:57.819
and food that he calls unclean.

00:17:57.819 --> 00:18:00.819
Please, test your servants for ten days

00:18:00.819 --> 00:18:03.819
and let us be given some vegetables to eat

00:18:03.819 --> 00:18:06.819
and water to drink.

00:18:06.819 --> 00:18:08.819
Vegetables.

00:18:08.819 --> 00:18:17.140
Just give us ten days.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.140
And then deal with your servants

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:40.339
according to what you see.

00:18:40.339 --> 00:21:21.859
Ashman has a something to do.

00:21:21.859 --> 00:21:22.859
My Lord,

00:21:22.859 --> 00:21:24.859
He's young men or woman.

00:21:24.859 --> 00:21:38.940
I know who they are.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:39.940
We've been watching you.

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:48.640
All of you.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.640
You don't bow to our idols.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:55.369
You pray only to your God

00:21:55.369 --> 00:22:01.740
and you are not eating our foods.

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:04.740
They insisted that their God would not have...

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.339
somehow.

00:22:07.339 --> 00:22:09.339
You look healthier than the others.

00:22:09.339 --> 00:22:14.960
Continue giving them the diet they've requested.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:22.690
And Belta Shazar,

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:32.140
your future is bright.

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:35.160
Don't waste it.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:54.730
Bring in the next group.

00:22:54.730 --> 00:23:09.720
Royal ration would be 15 kuru,

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.720
2 Payno and 5 Suto.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:20.190
Correct.

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:24.190
How much interest may a merchant charge on money and grain?

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:30.779
It would be 40% my Lord.

00:23:30.779 --> 00:23:32.779
40%.

00:23:32.779 --> 00:23:35.779
Have you learned going to be a thief in the past three years?

00:23:35.779 --> 00:23:40.309
And you, Meshak?

00:23:40.309 --> 00:23:42.309
The rate is 20%.

00:23:42.309 --> 00:23:48.380
Very good.

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:51.380
Which star of Enlil is brightest in the Urgala constellation?

00:23:51.380 --> 00:24:06.140
Do you know?

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:09.140
It is the Lugow star.

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:11.140
Impressive.

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:14.140
There is a tower that is high.

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.140
But nonetheless has no shade.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:22.019
What is it?

00:24:22.019 --> 00:24:23.019
Your ziggurat?

00:24:23.019 --> 00:24:25.619
Hopeless.

00:24:25.619 --> 00:24:35.019
You who can solve the riddle?

00:24:35.019 --> 00:24:38.019
It is sunlight, my Lord.

00:24:38.019 --> 00:24:40.019
Correct.

00:24:40.019 --> 00:24:45.019
My wisemen teach that the gods are responsible for everything.

00:24:45.019 --> 00:24:47.019
If that's so,

00:24:47.019 --> 00:24:50.019
why do the good suffer

00:24:50.019 --> 00:24:52.019
and the evil prosper?

00:24:52.019 --> 00:25:05.789
As you say, O King,

00:25:05.789 --> 00:25:08.789
the wise do not always have the food.

00:25:08.789 --> 00:25:11.789
Nor do the intelligent always have the riches.

00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:16.789
Nor do those with knowledge always have success

00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:20.789
because time and unexpected events overtake them all.

00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:26.569
Who wrote those words?

00:25:26.569 --> 00:25:30.299
Solomon.

00:25:30.299 --> 00:25:31.299
Fame for his wisdom.

00:25:31.299 --> 00:25:36.299
But its source was his God.

00:25:36.299 --> 00:25:38.299
Our God, Jehovah.

00:25:38.299 --> 00:25:47.750
Take them away.

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:48.750
When should we return?

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:51.099
You won't.

00:25:51.099 --> 00:25:55.589
Go back to your families.

00:25:55.589 --> 00:25:57.589
Prove them worthless.

00:25:57.589 --> 00:25:59.589
Build the sheds or no.

00:25:59.589 --> 00:26:01.589
Not the four of you.

00:26:01.589 --> 00:26:05.670
We have more to discuss.

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:14.869
I do not know your God.

00:26:14.869 --> 00:26:17.869
But you've proven to be ten times better than any priest

00:26:17.869 --> 00:26:23.200
or conjurer I've met.

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.200
Ashmanaz will arrange for you to serve in the palace

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.200
with my wisemen.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.700
Maybe your gifts are wasted in Jerusalem.

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.700
And here they'll be put to use.

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:56.470
The victory in Jerusalem is complete.

00:26:56.470 --> 00:27:02.420
Our forces are not preparing to be seized higher.

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:04.420
They should remember what happened as edikaya.

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:08.910
The gods were with us.

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:26.500
Jira, what is it?

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.500
It's about Jerusalem.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:55.240
Where are you going?

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.240
Just in my family.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:29:14.490
Jerusalem.

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:22.420
They tore down the walls.

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.420
They torched its towers.

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:36.049
They didn't die.

00:29:36.049 --> 00:29:41.059
And they burned down Jehovah's house.

00:29:41.059 --> 00:29:46.069
Why didn't our people listen?

00:29:46.069 --> 00:29:53.910
Did they think Jehovah couldn't see what they were doing?

00:29:54.910 --> 00:30:05.420
As long as our temple existed, our people had hope.

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:10.420
As long as Jehovah exists, we have hope.

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:20.319
He's rejected us because of our unrighteousness.

00:30:20.319 --> 00:30:24.319
He hasn't not everyone.

00:30:24.319 --> 00:30:30.319
Jehovah told Ezekiel that in his eyes,

00:30:30.319 --> 00:30:35.319
you, our righteous, has Noah,

00:30:35.319 --> 00:30:37.319
and Job.

00:30:37.319 --> 00:30:46.230
He said that.

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:53.569
He did.

00:30:53.569 --> 00:30:55.569
It's Jehovah who cares so much.

00:30:55.569 --> 00:31:00.259
And why are we in exile?

00:31:00.259 --> 00:31:06.069
Why can't we go home?

00:31:06.069 --> 00:31:10.539
Why can't we be together?

00:31:10.539 --> 00:31:31.589
You are home, son.

00:31:31.589 --> 00:31:36.089
Don't have all the answers.

00:31:36.089 --> 00:31:41.650
Stay close to Jehovah.

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:43.650
You will be blessed.

00:31:43.650 --> 00:32:40.009
I've had a dream.

00:32:40.009 --> 00:32:45.660
And I'm agitated.

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:46.660
I didn't know what I dreamed.

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:47.660
Okay.

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:48.660
May you live on forever.

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:50.660
Relate the dream to your service.

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:51.660
We will tell the interpretation.

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:52.660
No.

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:54.660
If you don't make the dream known to me,

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:56.660
along with the interpretation,

00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:58.660
you'll be dismembered.

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:02.660
And your houses will be turned to public latrines.

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.660
But if you do tell me the dream,

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:07.660
and the interpretation,

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:09.660
you'll receive gifts,

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:10.660
and a reward,

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:31.789
and great honor.

00:33:31.789 --> 00:33:33.789
You've agreed to tell me something false,

00:33:33.789 --> 00:33:36.789
and deceitful to a situation changes.

00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:37.789
The deceitful?

00:33:37.789 --> 00:33:42.000
The deceitful!

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
There is not a man on earth who can do with the King demands.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
What the King is asking is difficult.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:34:04.420
No one exists and tell this to the King except the gods.

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:07.420
Ariac sees them.

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:23.539
Kira.

00:34:23.539 --> 00:34:24.539
You're in danger.

00:34:24.539 --> 00:34:25.539
Why, what happened?

00:34:25.539 --> 00:34:26.539
I need everything.

00:34:26.539 --> 00:34:27.539
But the Weisman angered the King.

00:34:27.539 --> 00:34:30.539
Everyone's to be executed by dawn.

00:34:30.539 --> 00:34:33.539
Bring Hanania, Michelle, and Ezoraya here.

00:34:33.539 --> 00:34:39.630
I'll try to learn more.

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:40.630
Yes.

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:42.630
Taldian, Egyptian, Jewish.

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:48.699
All the Weisman.

00:34:48.699 --> 00:34:50.699
Ariac, both the Shazar.

00:34:50.699 --> 00:34:52.699
You should be here.

00:34:52.699 --> 00:34:55.699
Why is there such a harsh water from the King?

00:34:55.699 --> 00:34:57.699
He had a dream,

00:34:57.699 --> 00:35:00.699
and no one can tell him what it is.

00:35:00.699 --> 00:35:01.699
Flee now.

00:35:01.699 --> 00:35:04.699
If you speak before dawn, you might survive.

00:35:04.699 --> 00:36:00.639
Without wisdom!

00:36:00.639 --> 00:36:02.639
What are you doing here?

00:36:02.639 --> 00:36:04.639
I need to speak with the King.

00:36:04.639 --> 00:36:05.639
You need to go.

00:36:05.639 --> 00:36:07.639
Please, let me speak with him.

00:36:07.639 --> 00:36:14.059
My Lord, this is Belta Shazar.

00:36:14.059 --> 00:36:18.300
Okay.

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:22.300
Interpretations belong to my God, Jehovah.

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:27.480
He knows your dream and what it means.

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:28.480
Well, where is your God?

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:29.480
Where?

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:33.659
I believe that he...

00:36:34.659 --> 00:36:37.659
I know that he will reveal it to me.

00:36:37.659 --> 00:36:39.659
Please, give me time.

00:36:39.659 --> 00:36:48.059
We have until morning.

00:36:48.059 --> 00:36:50.059
To do what?

00:36:50.059 --> 00:36:52.059
To reveal the dream to the King.

00:36:52.059 --> 00:37:00.340
How much of the dream is Jehovah revealed to you?

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:06.500
Well, nothing yet.

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:11.500
But Jehovah revealed that he would interpret it.

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:12.500
Right?

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:15.000
Not exactly.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000
Daniel, how do you know this is even going to happen?

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.329
I can't be sure.

00:37:22.329 --> 00:37:24.329
You'd better be sure.

00:37:24.329 --> 00:37:27.329
His name is at stake.

00:37:27.329 --> 00:37:30.329
If he reveals the dream, it proves that he's the true God.

00:37:30.329 --> 00:37:31.329
If?

00:37:31.329 --> 00:37:44.239
What can we do to help?

00:37:47.789 --> 00:37:48.789
Pray.

00:37:48.789 --> 00:37:50.789
Pray that Jehovah have mercy on us.

00:37:50.789 --> 00:38:04.159
Oh, Jehovah.

00:38:04.159 --> 00:38:07.159
Surely you didn't bring us here just to die.

00:38:07.159 --> 00:38:11.019
What will people say?

00:38:11.019 --> 00:38:16.420
We told them that you are the God of the heavens,

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:20.420
the only God who can reveal secrets.

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:22.420
Please...

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:25.949
vindicate yourself.

00:38:25.949 --> 00:39:10.699
Jira?

00:39:10.699 --> 00:39:30.780
I found a man from the axiles of Judah,

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:33.780
who could make known the interpretation to the King.

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:37.820
I know who he is.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:40.820
Can you really make known to me the dream that I saw?

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:41.820
And its interpretation.

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:58.429
There is a God in the heavens who is a revealer of secrets.

00:39:58.429 --> 00:40:03.289
And he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar

00:40:03.289 --> 00:40:06.289
what is to happen in the final part of the days.

00:40:06.289 --> 00:40:11.230
This is your dream.

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:42.199
You saw an immense image.

00:40:42.199 --> 00:40:47.920
Image was standing in front of you.

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.920
You yourself are the head of gold

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:55.360
after you another kingdom will rise

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:57.360
inferior to you.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:00.360
Then another kingdom,

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:02.360
a third one of copper

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:05.360
that will rule over the whole earth.

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:07.360
As for the fourth kingdom,

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:09.360
it will be strong like iron.

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:14.380
The kingdom will be divided

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:16.380
and as the toes of the feet

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:20.380
were partly of iron and partly of clay,

00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:23.380
so the kingdom will be partly strong

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.380
and partly fragile.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:28.380
In the days of those kings,

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:31.380
the God of heaven will set up a kingdom

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:34.380
that will never be destroyed.

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:37.380
And this kingdom will not be passed

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:39.380
onto any other people.

00:41:39.380 --> 00:42:40.250
The dream is true

00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:44.719
and its interpretation is trustworthy.

00:43:23.289 --> 00:43:24.289
Quick!

00:43:24.289 --> 00:43:26.289
Bring the fine robe

00:43:26.289 --> 00:43:28.289
and a necklace of gold

00:43:28.289 --> 00:43:53.619
earned an instance before him.

00:43:53.619 --> 00:43:57.619
Truly your God is a God of gods.

00:43:57.619 --> 00:43:59.619
And a lord of kings

00:43:59.619 --> 00:44:02.619
and a revealer of secrets.

00:44:02.619 --> 00:44:04.619
May your God be honored

00:44:04.619 --> 00:44:06.619
by the honor I give you.

00:44:06.619 --> 00:44:09.889
You are now ruler

00:44:09.889 --> 00:44:12.889
over all the province of Babylon.

00:44:12.889 --> 00:44:18.780
O King,

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:21.780
these servants also worship the God in the heavens.

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:24.780
May they too be appointed

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:26.780
to administer the province.

00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:33.039
Make the necessary arrangements.

00:44:33.039 --> 00:44:37.789
You have proven far superior

00:44:37.789 --> 00:44:42.519
and they so-called wise men.

00:44:42.519 --> 00:44:46.380
I now appoint you

00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:48.380
their chief prefect.

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:57.159
Did you hear it in every caneser?

00:44:57.159 --> 00:44:58.159
When he said,

00:44:58.159 --> 00:45:00.159
your God is a God of gods

00:45:00.159 --> 00:45:02.159
and a lord of kings,

00:45:02.159 --> 00:45:05.159
Jehovah entered your prayer.

00:45:05.159 --> 00:45:07.159
Jehovah answered our prayers.

00:45:23.579 --> 00:45:25.579
What's going to happen next?

00:45:26.579 --> 00:45:31.239
Can we go back to Jerusalem?

00:45:31.239 --> 00:45:33.239
I don't know what happens next,

00:45:33.239 --> 00:45:36.239
but as long as we stay close to Jehovah,

00:45:36.239 --> 00:45:38.239
you will always be with us

00:45:38.239 --> 00:45:42.900
as long as we have faith in Him.

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:50.139
There's nothing in the stars

00:45:50.139 --> 00:45:52.139
about kingdom's crushing kingdoms.

00:45:52.139 --> 00:45:53.139
Of course not.

00:45:53.139 --> 00:46:01.000
It's a trick.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000
But how did he know the dream?

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.000
I'm a rooter.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.820
I'm a rooter.

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:08.820
Put a message from the God.

00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:10.820
I have examined a sheep's liver.

00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:12.820
Your future is bright.

00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:14.820
Stars of Shabbatue, the giant.

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:15.820
Speak only of your grandeur.

00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:17.820
And I'm the head of gold.

00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:18.820
Jehovah said so.

00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:20.820
Your dream revealed many good things.

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:22.820
But you spelled the Shazar?

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:24.820
He's a Jew.

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.820
He's a clever Jew to be sure.

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:28.820
But he couldn't interpret dreams

00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:29.820
before he came to Babylon.

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:32.820
He first had to be educated here

00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:34.820
and given a Babylonian name.

00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:39.170
A name that honors our great God, Bell.

00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:42.170
Bell used this young captive

00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:44.170
to reveal great things to you.

00:46:44.170 --> 00:46:50.760
Bell, not yourhovah who you defeated in Jerusalem.

00:46:50.760 --> 00:47:19.619
So the tree is my enemies.

00:47:19.619 --> 00:47:23.619
Who is it after the seven times pass over?

00:47:23.619 --> 00:47:29.949
Then it is you again, a great king.

00:47:29.949 --> 00:47:33.360
You are fools.

00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:39.179
At last, built to Shazar,

00:47:40.179 --> 00:47:43.179
the chief of the magic practicing priests.

00:47:43.179 --> 00:47:46.179
All of the otherwise men are unable

00:47:46.179 --> 00:47:48.179
to make the interpretation onto me.

00:47:49.679 --> 00:47:58.559
But you're able to do so.

00:47:58.559 --> 00:48:05.900
Explain to me the visions I've seen in my dream.

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:13.590
What did you dream?

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:17.590
I saw a tree in the midst of the earth.

00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:19.590
And it's height.

00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:20.590
It was enormous.

00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:21.590
It was enormous.

00:48:21.590 --> 00:48:22.590
And the tree grew.

00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:25.590
And it became strong.

00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:27.590
And it's top.

00:48:28.590 --> 00:48:39.550
It was the heaven.

00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:41.550
The name of my own and of copper.

00:48:41.550 --> 00:48:53.269
So who's the tree?

00:48:53.269 --> 00:49:21.389
And the dream apply to those hating you.

00:49:21.389 --> 00:49:24.389
And it's interpretation to your enemies.

00:49:24.389 --> 00:49:27.389
The tree that you saw.

00:49:27.389 --> 00:49:30.389
That grew great and became strong.

00:49:30.389 --> 00:49:34.389
Whose top reached the heavens and was visible to all the earth.

00:49:34.389 --> 00:49:38.389
Which had beautiful foliage, abundant fruit,

00:49:38.389 --> 00:49:39.389
and food for all.

00:49:39.389 --> 00:49:46.389
beneath which the beasts of the field would dwell, and on whose branches the birds of the heavens would reside.

00:49:46.389 --> 00:49:59.860
It is you, O King, and the King saw a watcher, a holy one coming down from the heavens who were saying,

00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:02.860
shop down the tree and destroy it.

00:50:23.639 --> 00:50:29.639
To leave the stump with its roots in the ground, with a banding of iron and of copper,

00:50:29.639 --> 00:50:37.019
and let the dew of the heavens make it wet, it's portioned thee with the beasts of the field,

00:50:37.019 --> 00:50:42.480
until seven times pass over it.

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.480
This is the interpretation, O King.

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:47.480
It is the decree of the most high.

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:54.480
You will be driven away from among men, and your dwelling will be with the beasts of the field.

00:50:55.480 --> 00:51:02.480
And you will be given vegetation to eat, just like bulls, and you will become wet with the dew of the heavens.

00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:11.480
And seven times will pass over you, until you know that the most high is ruler in the kingdom of mankind,

00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:14.480
and that he grants it to whomever he wants.

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:22.500
But because they said to leave the stump of the tree with its roots, your kingdom will be yours again.

00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:34.949
After you come to know that the heavens are ruling, turn away from your sins by doing what is right,

00:51:34.949 --> 00:51:58.269
and from your iniquity by showing mercy to the poor, it may be that your prosperity will be extended.

00:51:58.269 --> 00:52:00.269
Does Belta Shazzar know in this world?

00:52:00.269 --> 00:52:09.639
No, but your wise men doubt that his interpretation can be trusted.

00:52:09.639 --> 00:52:11.639
Look at the facts.

00:52:11.639 --> 00:52:25.170
Egypt's gods told the Egyptians that they would defeat us, yet you destroyed them.

00:52:25.170 --> 00:52:30.170
So why should the god of the Jews be given any more credit?

00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:38.809
Look at what you've done. The gods are with you.

00:52:38.809 --> 00:52:44.809
You have made Babylon the greatest kingdom on earth.

00:52:44.809 --> 00:52:51.409
Belta Shazzar wants you to grovel like a slave.

00:52:51.409 --> 00:52:56.409
You. A strong king means a strong king.

00:52:56.409 --> 00:53:00.489
Let's continue with our discussion.

00:53:00.489 --> 00:53:01.489
The stars end well.

00:53:01.489 --> 00:53:06.489
Now the Luke out star is the brightest star in the Ergol of Constance.

00:53:06.489 --> 00:53:08.489
Stars are reliable.

00:53:08.489 --> 00:53:15.250
Unlike the gods of defeated nations, go back to Jews.

00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:35.920
Oh, you could if there was anything left of it.

00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:38.920
Has Jehovah revealed anything new?

00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:41.920
It's been ten months.

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.920
Still no sign of this supposed insanity.

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:45.920
I trust my god.

00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:49.920
Yes, as we do, when we read the stars.

00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:52.920
But we still shape the message.

00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:55.920
You will be held responsible for the words.

00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:58.920
And when a wise man speaks lies.

00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:05.019
I spoke only what Jehovah revealed.

00:54:05.019 --> 00:54:07.019
Have you forgotten?

00:54:07.019 --> 00:54:11.019
What happened when some couldn't interpret the dream image?

00:54:11.019 --> 00:54:13.019
A death sentence followed.

00:54:13.019 --> 00:54:16.019
And that was a flattering interpretation.

00:54:16.019 --> 00:54:18.019
The king was ahead of gold.

00:54:18.019 --> 00:54:21.019
This time you said he'll go mad.

00:54:21.019 --> 00:54:25.460
And nothing has happened.

00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:27.460
It will happen.

00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:30.460
Maybe. Maybe not.

00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:33.460
But your words are against the king.

00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:35.460
It's treason.

00:54:35.460 --> 00:55:03.539
And no one can protect you from that.

00:55:03.539 --> 00:55:05.539
Ten months.

00:55:05.539 --> 00:55:07.539
Nothing has happened.

00:55:07.539 --> 00:55:11.920
But your words are against the king.

00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:15.920
Still no sign of this supposed insanity.

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:17.920
It's treason.

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:21.619
And no one can protect you from that.

00:55:21.619 --> 00:56:13.949
What's words with you?

00:56:13.949 --> 00:56:16.949
Instruct me in your way, Oh Jehovah.

00:56:16.949 --> 00:56:19.949
Do not hand me over to my adversaries.

00:56:19.949 --> 00:56:22.949
For false witnesses have risen up against me.

00:56:22.949 --> 00:56:25.949
And they threaten me with violence.

00:56:25.949 --> 00:56:31.420
Where would I be if I did not have faith?

00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:35.420
That I would see Jehovah's goodness in the land of the living?

00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:41.250
Please, test your servants for ten days.

00:56:41.250 --> 00:56:46.250
Somehow, you look healthier than the others.

00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:49.250
Continue giving them the diet they've requested.

00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:52.530
I did not know you're gone.

00:56:53.530 --> 00:56:59.030
But you've proven ten times better than any priest or conjurer I've met.

00:56:59.030 --> 00:57:01.030
He had a dream.

00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:14.519
And no one can tell him what it is.

00:57:14.519 --> 00:57:19.500
Jehovah answered your prayer.

00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:22.500
Hope in Jehovah.

00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:25.500
The courageous and strong of heart.

00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:27.500
Yes.

00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:39.420
Hope in Jehovah.

00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:50.570
For our sacrifice to build.

00:57:50.570 --> 00:57:52.570
To the gods.

00:57:52.570 --> 00:57:57.409
To the gods.

00:57:57.409 --> 00:57:58.409
To the gods.

00:57:58.409 --> 00:57:59.409
This city.

00:57:59.409 --> 00:58:00.409
The world.

00:58:00.409 --> 00:58:01.409
Look at the Ishtar Gate.

00:58:01.409 --> 00:58:02.409
The gardens.

00:58:02.409 --> 00:58:03.409
The Zigarots.

00:58:03.409 --> 00:58:05.409
So high.

00:58:05.409 --> 00:58:07.409
He reaches the gods themselves.

00:58:07.409 --> 00:58:12.420
No one would question that.

00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:15.420
It's odd that only twelve months ago, one of your servants.

00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:17.420
Dare to suggest that you go and say.

00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:19.420
Is this not Babylon the Great?

00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:23.420
That I myself have built for the royal house.

00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:27.139
With my own strength and might.

00:58:27.139 --> 00:58:30.139
And for the glory of my majesty.

00:58:30.139 --> 00:58:34.289
To you, it is being said.

00:58:34.289 --> 00:58:36.289
O King Nebuchadnezzar.

00:58:36.289 --> 00:58:39.289
The kingdom has gone away from you.

00:58:39.289 --> 00:58:42.289
And from mankind, you are being driven away.

00:58:42.289 --> 00:58:45.289
With the beasts of the field, your dwelling will be.

00:58:45.289 --> 00:58:48.289
And you will be given vegetation to eat.

00:58:48.289 --> 00:58:50.289
Just like goals.

00:58:50.289 --> 00:58:53.289
And seven times will pass over.

00:58:53.289 --> 00:59:00.289
Until you know that the most high is ruler in the kingdom of mankind.

00:59:00.289 --> 00:59:05.289
And that he grants it to whomever he wants.

00:59:05.289 --> 00:59:42.099
Built consistently.

00:59:42.099 --> 00:59:44.099
How can you claim Daniel to be a fraud?

00:59:44.099 --> 00:59:46.099
This was a trick.

00:59:46.099 --> 00:59:49.099
Daniel conspired against your father.

00:59:49.099 --> 00:59:51.099
A trick.

00:59:51.099 --> 00:59:56.389
Then how did he make it happen?

00:59:56.389 --> 00:59:58.389
Everything he has said has come true.

00:59:58.389 --> 01:00:00.389
Which is quite different from what he has written for you.

01:00:00.389 --> 01:00:01.389
My father.

01:00:01.389 --> 01:00:56.940
Who is this God in the heavens?

01:00:56.940 --> 01:00:57.940
Jehovah.
