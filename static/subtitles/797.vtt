WEBVTT

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.969
Now, at this time, I'd like to ask the cameras to pan this audience,

00:00:06.969 --> 00:00:15.140
because this program is going to be posted later on JW Broadcasting.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:21.140
And we want the folks at home to see what the audience should look like

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.140
just before the musical program is presented.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.140
Now, folks at home, this is what you should look like.

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:48.509
Now, at many regional conventions this summer, the audience did look like that.

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:53.509
And then there were other conventions.

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:57.460
We'll pray for you.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.460
But your brothers and sisters are to be commended for your fine cooperation.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.459
You know, the 10-minute musical program that you are going to see,

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.459
the Prelude to the Annual Meeting,

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:13.459
it took an entire day just to film,

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:16.459
not counting all of the rehearsal time on the part of the choristers,

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:21.459
and then there was the editing time on top of that.

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:24.459
And these programs take a lot of work.

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:28.459
A lot goes into it, a lot of expense on the part of musicians and so on.

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:34.459
And so it's just appropriate that we show proper respect for what is being done.

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:37.459
So your brothers and sisters are to be commended.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:02:00.950
To reach good news,

00:02:00.950 --> 00:04:17.730
but it's time to pray that we succeed.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.730
Excited about this annual meeting program.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.730
And we think you will be too.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.730
It is going to be historic.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.730
And at the end of the program,

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:35.730
we'll realize that we have Jehovah to thank for all these good things.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.730
Jehovah is the source of all spiritual food.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:46.730
All that they faithful and discreet slave does is do a little bit of the cooking.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.730
Put a little garnish on it.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.730
But Jehovah is really the source of all these good things.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.730
Now, one of the spiritual good things that Jehovah has provided over the years

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.730
is our midweek meeting.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:06.730
And we're going to trace the history of the midweek meeting in a video.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.509
Please enjoy.

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:16.509
As Jehovah's people, we enjoy ongoing theocratic education.

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:19.509
And our midweek meeting is a big part of that.

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:23.509
It's actually a combination of three smaller meetings.

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:28.509
The congregation Bible study, the theocratic ministry school, and the service meeting.

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:31.509
But was it always this way?

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:35.509
How did our midweek meeting actually develop?

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:40.509
Imagine if we could go back in time.

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:44.509
When Charles Russell began searching for the truth,

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:48.509
he saw the need to meet with others who had the same goal.

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:54.509
So in 1879, he organized a small Bible class.

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:59.509
A few years later, meetings were being held every Sunday and Wednesday.

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:04.509
Those came to be called prayer, praise, and testimony meetings.

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:09.509
Well, they were held during the week, sometime and evening then.

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:13.509
And they usually started out by someone opening with prayer.

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:20.509
And then someone presiding would make some expression of praise to God,

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:23.509
read a scripture, and then perhaps open it.

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:26.509
Others would make a comment on that scripture.

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:28.509
And then a brother would offer prayer.

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:33.509
But when the prayer was offered, everyone would get up from their chairs and kneel in front of them.

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:36.509
And for a child, some of the prayers seemed long.

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:40.509
And then once that was done, the cycle went round again.

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:44.509
After several volumes of the book Millennial Dawn had been published,

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:49.509
the Bible students began using this as a basis for study.

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:55.509
By 1895, these meetings came to be known as Dawn Circles,

00:06:55.509 --> 00:06:58.509
and were held in private homes.

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:03.509
Later, these meetings were called Berean Circles for Bible Study.

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:07.509
It was a question and answer consideration of the printed material,

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:10.509
and everyone was invited to participate.

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:16.509
This meeting would become the four runner of the congregation book study.

00:07:16.509 --> 00:07:24.509
Therefore, advertise, advertise, advertise the king and his kingdom.

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:29.509
Following the landmark convention of Cedar Point, Ohio in 1922,

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:33.509
greater emphasis was placed on the field ministry.

00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:36.509
And they said, you go down this side of the street, and we'll go down this street.

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:39.509
I know by myself, I've never been out before I'm alive.

00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:42.509
My early experience in the ministry was using a testimony card.

00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:45.509
And this is what a testimony card looks like.

00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:47.509
And at that time, we didn't say very much.

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:51.509
You just handed the card over, and you said, will you please read it?

00:07:51.509 --> 00:07:55.509
We didn't make a return. We just placed letters and kept on going.

00:07:55.509 --> 00:08:01.509
You go to the door, and I can remember, I would say, I have a sort of Bible talk on a photograph record.

00:08:01.509 --> 00:08:02.509
Can I play it for you?

00:08:02.509 --> 00:08:09.509
It's something you should have told them, but really, we weren't trained at that time to talk to people.

00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:16.509
To assist the Bible students in this effort, a newsletter began to be issued called Bulletin.

00:08:16.509 --> 00:08:24.509
It contained service instructions and a brief testimony that could be memorized for witnessing to people.

00:08:24.509 --> 00:08:30.509
By 1928, congregations were urged to hold service meetings each week.

00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:40.509
And by 1935, the watchtower encouraged all congregations to base the service meeting on information published in the director.

00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:45.509
Later called, informant, still later, King to ministry.

00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:51.509
Then our kingdom service, now called our kingdom ministry.

00:08:51.509 --> 00:09:00.509
This meeting soon became a regular feature of each congregation schedule offering practical guidance for the preaching work.

00:09:00.509 --> 00:09:05.509
By the 1940s, the Second World War was raging.

00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:11.509
Opposition was steadily growing against Jehovah's people in many parts of the world.

00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:17.509
And while our testimony cards and phonographs helped to bring a unity to the work,

00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:27.509
the time had now come to equip every member of the congregation to speak effectively as a teacher of God's Word.

00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:35.509
That was the objective of a special school established in each congregation beginning in 1943.

00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:43.509
Every week, instruction was given and students delivered talks and received constructive counsel on them.

00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:52.509
For the brothers, they were really nervous. Some their knees were shaking. Others, I remember one brother scratched his chest.

00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:57.509
My first talk, I was the first one in that congregation.

00:09:57.509 --> 00:10:01.509
So I made a box and I sloped it, made it into a little podium.

00:10:01.509 --> 00:10:06.509
But then I put a tablecloth that reached the floor so they wouldn't see my knees wobbling.

00:10:06.509 --> 00:10:10.509
And I didn't know when I started, when I finished. Oh boy, oh boy.

00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:15.509
I was afraid that the first four rows could hear my heart beating because it was really bumpy.

00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:20.509
I gave a talk on Hill, getting started off with a bang.

00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:27.509
Well, my nerves got the best of me. I started sobbing, sobbing, sobbing all the way through.

00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:31.509
But I didn't stop. I didn't give up. My father was sitting in the front row.

00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:38.509
He kept looking at me every time I'd look up. He was looking at me. I said, I can't quit. So I got through it.

00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:44.509
I feel like my heart was going to leap out of my mouth.

00:10:44.509 --> 00:10:50.509
The day of my talk, I drank a coke to calm myself down.

00:10:50.509 --> 00:10:57.509
When the talk began, I had to suppress the belt and also my intense stage fright.

00:10:57.509 --> 00:11:03.509
I remember I was about nine or ten years old and I had to read a portion of Leviticus.

00:11:03.509 --> 00:11:09.509
And it was a portion where the Bible describes a death penalty for sex offenders.

00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:13.509
I was actually too small to understand what it was all about.

00:11:13.509 --> 00:11:18.509
But since I didn't understand it, I read it very loud and very enthusiastically.

00:11:18.509 --> 00:11:26.509
We picked two of the most qualified brothers that we thought we had to give these student talks.

00:11:26.509 --> 00:11:32.509
And the first brother to get up, he just got nicely started in this talk.

00:11:32.509 --> 00:11:37.509
He just fell over in the faint. And we got him out of the way.

00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:47.509
And the next brother, he talked and he's reached in his pocket while he was talking and took out a book of matches and lit them.

00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:51.509
And one burnt down. He took another match out and lit that.

00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:58.509
And after a show, we said, well, what in the world did your matches have to do with your talk?

00:11:58.509 --> 00:12:04.509
And he didn't even believe he lit the matches. We had the show on the floor where he threw the burnt match.

00:12:04.509 --> 00:12:08.509
So that tells you how hard it was for us.

00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:17.509
At first, only brothers gave talks in the school. But by 1959, sisters were also invited to enroll.

00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:22.509
I do remember vividly. I was at Yankee Stadium Convention in 1958.

00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:29.509
And brother Nore gave that surprise announcement that sisters would be included in the academic ministry school.

00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:36.509
So I looked forward to it with fear and trepidation, but also eager to participate, eager to learn.

00:12:36.509 --> 00:12:44.509
And one of the things that I really loved was that when the first things they taught us in a ministry school was to smile.

00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:51.509
Because we'd been talking about, you know, really there's a snare in a racket. You didn't really smile when you taught.

00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:58.509
But now they show it. They urge us to smile and show our enjoyment of what we knew.

00:12:58.509 --> 00:13:04.509
Sometimes I just start giggling during my talk. I try to continue my talk.

00:13:04.509 --> 00:13:08.509
But I kept giggling and giggling until I couldn't speak anymore.

00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:15.509
I was very, very nervous about it. It was to be six minutes. I got through it in three or four.

00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:20.509
Oh, we were very happy to hear the sisters. They gave the best talks.

00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:26.509
But for many, it took some time to get used to speaking before an audience.

00:13:26.509 --> 00:13:36.720
Gesturing. I was making my gestures so many to under the speaker stand or on my lap. And they said, get them upward.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:41.720
It seemed like when you were giving a talk, you froze.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:47.720
We were taught about gestures at the Fuketic Ministry school.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:54.720
And we tried to apply it like a robot, like this.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.720
So I would speak very nicely, very gently and very softly.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:03.720
And so I had to find out how I'd speak a little louder without shouting, you know.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:08.720
The problem that I always seemed to have was I had too much to say in the allotted time.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:14.720
And of course, the bell would ring. You would get a little red in the face and step down.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:21.720
And you knew what the Theocratic Ministry school overseer was going to mention to you.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:30.889
This school has helped Jehovah's people become effective teachers in the ministry.

00:14:30.889 --> 00:14:37.889
And I had some problems with studding. And as far as facing crowds, let alone just facing a person one-on-one,

00:14:37.889 --> 00:14:42.889
I had that kind of a difficulty. And the school helped, especially with just a reading.

00:14:42.889 --> 00:14:50.889
By nature, I'm Tim Midshye. I find that the training received in the school and in the service meeting has helped me overcome those problems.

00:14:50.889 --> 00:14:54.889
But as far as the ministry is concerned, it gave you more confidence.

00:14:54.889 --> 00:14:58.889
You get to know what other people believe and you know where to go from.

00:14:58.889 --> 00:15:03.889
And then it makes you more prayerful. So it was very practical.

00:15:03.889 --> 00:15:06.889
We had the demonstrations of what to do, what not to do.

00:15:06.889 --> 00:15:14.889
Training from the Theocratic Ministry school helped me witness to school teachers and students.

00:15:14.889 --> 00:15:21.889
Almost every day, or at least regularly, they had to get up and do something for the class in school.

00:15:21.889 --> 00:15:25.889
I found that the Theocratic Ministry school was a real help there.

00:15:25.889 --> 00:15:29.889
That got you used to speaking before our audience and gave you confidence in yourself.

00:15:29.889 --> 00:15:33.889
Well, the school surely helped me to make a deeper study of the Bible.

00:15:33.889 --> 00:15:39.889
And it also helped me to concentrate and to look for better ways to convey the message to other people.

00:15:39.889 --> 00:15:46.889
We learned to rely on Jehovah because you were up there and it was you talking and the householder listening.

00:15:46.889 --> 00:15:50.889
But Jehovah had to help you get through it with his Holy Spirit.

00:15:50.889 --> 00:16:00.220
Progress was obvious. With all of us, we did better and better.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:04.220
And then we started getting Bible studies and teaching them what they needed.

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:11.220
It was amazing to see the people that have never knew anything about preaching or talking and public.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.220
More teachers than they were before.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:19.220
To me, these midweek meetings have really proven to be Jehovah's instrument

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:23.220
to help these people to be Jehovah's witnesses in the real sense of the word,

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:29.220
because the witness has to speak. And Jehovah has educated us through these two meetings.

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:33.220
All of our schools have a sort of a core curriculum.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:38.220
They want to help us to draw closer to Jehovah, to have a more personal relationship with him,

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:41.220
and to be able to imitate Jesus' personality.

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:45.220
This Theocratic Ministry school and the service meeting

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:50.220
has helped these people to preach the good news of the kingdom all over the world,

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:57.220
but especially to fulfill the prophecy of Matthew 24, verse 14.

00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:03.220
On January 1st, 2009, another significant change was made.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:08.220
The congregation book study was renamed Congregation Bible Study

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:12.220
and combined with the Theocratic Ministry school and service meeting.

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:19.220
This adjustment was made to encourage us to use the extra evening for family worship.

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:23.220
As we trace back the development of our midweek meeting,

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:27.220
we see that good refinements were made along the way.

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:32.220
So, what will the next refinement be?

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:54.390
Well, did that last statement get your attention?

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:57.390
What will the next refinement be?

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:00.390
You're about to find out.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.390
Brother Anthony Morris has the answer.

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:09.390
And you know, his part looks really interesting, our Christian life and ministry.

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:12.920
Let's listen.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:17.920
Gather the men, the women, the little children,

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:24.920
in order that they may listen and learn about in fear, Jehovah.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:29.920
Jehovah decreed that to his people many centuries ago,

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:34.920
and he continues to decree as our sovereign that we meet together.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:40.920
Now, what's the primary reason that we gather together?

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.920
The authority is inspired written scriptures.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:49.920
So, let's turn to Psalm 22 to answer that question.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:19:04.420
Psalm 22 and verse 22.

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:10.660
I will declare your name to my brothers.

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:15.660
In the midst of the congregation, I will praise you.

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:23.660
So yes, it's to praise Jehovah to worship our Heavenly Father, Jehovah God.

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:28.660
Now, meetings also contribute to our unity.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:32.660
They bring joy, they bring encouragement.

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:37.660
And many, at least in the viewing audience I have here in front of me,

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:41.660
well, finally, remember Brother George Ganges,

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:47.660
what a positive spirit Brother Ganges always displayed for any of the privilege to be around him.

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:54.660
And in his life story, he expresses nicely how he felt about the meetings.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:59.660
To me, meeting with the brothers is one of life's greatest pleasures

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:02.660
and a source of encouragement.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.660
I love to be at the kingdom home.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:09.660
I feel an inward joy when talking with God's people.

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:15.660
When I am among them, I feel at home with my family in a spiritual paradise.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:20.660
As you know, if you knew him, that was one of his favorite topics, spiritual paradise.

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:26.660
Also, at meetings, I feel Jehovah's spirit in a greater measure.

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:32.660
Beautiful appreciation for Jehovah's decree that we meet together.

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:35.660
And that's also where Jehovah educates his people.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:41.660
We find the scripture being applied where he tells us this is the way, walk in it.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:48.660
Now, Jehovah God has determined that he's going to perpetuate divine teaching.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:53.660
What does that mean? That means he's going to cause it to go on forever.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:21:00.900
Interesting question, though, how long has Jehovah been a teacher?

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.900
He's been a teacher since he was a parent.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:09.900
And in prophecy, we find what's said about his favorite pupil.

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:13.900
So to turn your Bibles, please, excuse me, Isaiah, chapter 50.

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:18.019
Isaiah, chapter 50.

00:21:18.019 --> 00:21:28.950
And it prophetically depicts Jehovah's favorite pupil.

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:31.950
Isaiah, chapter 50, verse 4.

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:36.950
The sovereign Lord, Jehovah, has given me the tongue of those taught

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:41.950
so that I may know how to answer the tired one with the right word.

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:43.950
He awakens me morning by morning.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:48.950
He awakens my ear to listen like the top ones.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:53.950
So Jehovah has been teaching Jesus for eons of time, his free human existence,

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:59.950
and then his time on the earth, teaching his favorite pupil.

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:06.950
And yet, it's adventurous that with all of the close association Jesus had with Jehovah,

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:12.950
what did he always use as an authority for his teaching?

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:16.950
You know, Jehovah's Word.

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:20.950
And what was available at the time was the 39 books of the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:28.950
And we can take the Sermon on the Mount as an example of how he always used as a basis the Scriptures.

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:35.490
21 quotations from the Hebrew Scriptures in the Sermon on the Mount.

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:41.490
Three from Exodus, two from Leviticus, one from Numbers, six from Deuteronomy,

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:49.490
one from Second Kings, four from Psalms, three from Isaiah, and one from Jeremiah.

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:59.490
This is the authority, even with all of his association and how he could have waxed poetic and beautiful thoughts Scripture.

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:01.490
Perfect example.

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:09.490
So he set the example for his disciples and commissioned them likewise to perpetuate, divine teaching.

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:13.490
How do they do is turning to Scripture as the authority?

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:23.180
There's an excellent example, turn your Bibles to Romans, chapter 15.

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:39.549
And here in the 15th chapter, we look at verse 7 here, and he's discussing the welcoming spirit and how Christ is involved with that.

00:23:39.549 --> 00:23:43.549
He's taught what he's teaching here.

00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:54.549
Notice verse 9, in the middle part of the verse, Paul says, just as it is written, and then he quotes Scripture.

00:23:54.549 --> 00:24:00.549
And then in the cross reference, we can see where he's likely taking that from verse 10.

00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:04.549
And again, he says, and he's quoting Scripture.

00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:10.549
Verse 11, and again, praised your whole volume. He's quoting Scripture.

00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:17.549
And then in verse 12, he quotes Isaiah regarding the root of Jesse.

00:24:17.549 --> 00:24:29.549
So they got the message that their perfect son of God example wants Scripture as the authority for the teaching.

00:24:29.549 --> 00:24:33.549
And then you may recall with the Paul being before a gripper.

00:24:33.549 --> 00:24:57.549
So even when we're teaching those that are not worshipers of the true God, he stated this in Acts 26, I continue to this day bearing witness to both small and great saying nothing except what the prophets as well as Moses stated was going to take place.

00:24:57.549 --> 00:25:02.549
All the glory back to Scripture, not to him.

00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:08.549
So Jesus footstep followers knew to fulfill Matthew 28, 19 and 20.

00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:13.549
They must base their teaching squarely on Jehovah's word.

00:25:13.549 --> 00:25:17.549
And Jehovah foretold this was going to be the case.

00:25:17.549 --> 00:25:25.549
Quite interesting in a prophecy, not too often referred to, but turned Isaiah chapter 59.

00:25:25.549 --> 00:25:42.259
So that we see the disciples of Jesus, the anointed ones took from the mouth of Jesus and they've passed it on to the great crowd.

00:25:42.259 --> 00:25:56.259
And Scripture foretold the perpetuation of divine teaching and Jehovah's making a very clear nothing will ever interfere with divine teaching being perpetuated.

00:25:56.259 --> 00:26:05.259
No matter what it may appear like nothing will interfere in verse 21 of Isaiah 59.

00:26:05.259 --> 00:26:19.259
And it reads as for me, this is my covenant with them says Jehovah, my spirit that is on you and my words that I've placed in your mouth, they will not be removed from your mouth.

00:26:19.259 --> 00:26:33.259
And notice now those down generations from the mouth of your children or from the mouth of your grandchildren says Jehovah from now on and forever.

00:26:33.259 --> 00:26:43.259
So divine teaching would be perpetuated in the mouth of Christ Jesus to as anointed footstep followers and then to the great crowd.

00:26:43.259 --> 00:26:54.259
It continues to be presented. Well, we all have an individual responsibility in this. This is going to happen, but as individuals, we've had to do our part.

00:26:54.259 --> 00:27:03.259
So just three things to keep in mind how we do our part when it comes to receiving divine teaching.

00:27:03.259 --> 00:27:15.259
First, read God's Word regularly and as many times as we said it, some fail to do it. And that's not to be critical. Just please get the message.

00:27:15.259 --> 00:27:23.259
Do not just be a reader of the Bible. That's commendable. You must meditate on it.

00:27:23.259 --> 00:27:35.259
And that's a whole another lengthy talk about meditation, simply put slow down when you're reading and get it with you.

00:27:35.259 --> 00:27:42.259
There's things that we can do to help with that, but you have to do it. I have to do it. Don't just read it.

00:27:42.259 --> 00:27:51.259
I read the Bible in six months. So you must not have a lot to do because that's a whole lot of meditation to get it done that quick.

00:27:51.259 --> 00:27:57.259
If you're spending a good portion of the time, you've allotted for it. That's nothing to brag about.

00:27:57.259 --> 00:28:05.259
You better off doing one chapter and it really penetrates them to be in some sort of challenge.

00:28:05.259 --> 00:28:11.259
The next one is a very crucial absorb the instruction that we find in our publications.

00:28:11.259 --> 00:28:19.259
So while videos are very important, you still and I still have to behave like a sponge.

00:28:19.259 --> 00:28:25.259
A sponge is not going to bring anything up and soak it up unless it's put in a substance.

00:28:25.259 --> 00:28:31.259
So we're not going to be able to absorb the instruction in our publications if we don't put ourselves in them.

00:28:31.259 --> 00:28:54.259
So you've got to read on if blind we have other methods to help them, but you've got to take the time to absorb what's in the publications and very crucial basic, but necessary to remind us of prepare for, not just a 10, but prepare for in a 10 Christian meetings.

00:28:54.259 --> 00:29:07.259
Now, as the opening video pointed out, and we found that very refreshing, the meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses have been refined in many ways over the years.

00:29:07.259 --> 00:29:23.259
And I have the privilege to tell you that the governing bodies pleased to set forth another adjustment to you caught that with the end of the video and so that was well done.

00:29:23.259 --> 00:29:33.259
Why the need for a change less than 10 years after the adjustments that went into effect in January 2009.

00:29:33.259 --> 00:29:36.259
It's a fair question.

00:29:36.259 --> 00:29:40.259
So here's some things to consider.

00:29:40.259 --> 00:29:48.259
The purpose of the school and service meeting has always been to equip us to become effective preachers and teachers of God's word.

00:29:48.259 --> 00:29:56.259
I remember times past publications such as all scriptures inspired have gotten beneficial reasoning from the scriptures.

00:29:56.259 --> 00:30:02.259
They were available to the majority of publishers, but many other publications were not.

00:30:02.259 --> 00:30:12.259
Older theocratic ministry school schedules helped us become familiar with the wide variety of information in these publications.

00:30:12.259 --> 00:30:22.259
Think about this, not everything published in the reasoning book was well suited for initiating field service conversations in every land.

00:30:22.259 --> 00:30:32.259
Now, for one, I loved the reasoning book was released there in the 80s and at the time we were serving in Rhode Island, a Catholic stronghold.

00:30:32.259 --> 00:30:35.259
So we loved the book.

00:30:35.259 --> 00:30:39.539
However, think about it.

00:30:39.539 --> 00:30:44.539
What general appeal with the topic of apostolic succession?

00:30:44.539 --> 00:30:53.339
Having lands where Catholicism doesn't hold sway.

00:30:53.339 --> 00:31:02.339
No matter how much the man gets around, there's a lot of places could care less if he ever visited.

00:31:02.339 --> 00:31:08.829
Bethel's one for sure.

00:31:08.829 --> 00:31:13.210
Sorry, that was in fact.

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:17.210
There's something else to think about.

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:25.210
The correspondancy between student assignments and actual field service encounters was not always likely.

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:28.210
Here's a real scenario from a couple months ago.

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:30.210
Talk number three.

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:31.210
The theme.

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:32.210
Delilah.

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:36.779
The love of money can lead to betrayal.

00:31:36.779 --> 00:31:46.779
To all your sisters like this, a sister giving this talk had to select a setting from the list appearing on page 82 of the ministry school book.

00:31:46.779 --> 00:31:52.779
So with that theme, which setting would she choose?

00:31:52.779 --> 00:31:55.779
Giving a house to house presentation.

00:31:55.779 --> 00:32:03.000
Witnessing informally in a waiting room.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.000
How about encouraging a Bible student to attend meetings?

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
That one seems safer.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000
But now she reads her assignment slip again.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:29.019
And she sees that she's working on study 47 effective use of visual aids, challenging for our sisters on occasion with the talks.

00:32:29.019 --> 00:32:44.019
In recent times, study aids such as the Watchtower Publications Index, the Research Guide, the Insight Values and the Reference Bible have become available to more publishers around the world, either in printed form or electronic form.

00:32:44.019 --> 00:32:52.019
So this opens opportunities to broaden and deepen our joint study of the Bible.

00:32:52.019 --> 00:33:07.019
The possibility now exists to focus the first part of our meetings on gaining deeper knowledge of the scriptures, which is in fact the basis for our teaching.

00:33:07.019 --> 00:33:13.019
The scriptures, all divine teachings based on scriptures.

00:33:13.019 --> 00:33:26.019
And at the same time, it's also now possible to focus student assignments on actual situations that might even arise the same week in their territory.

00:33:26.019 --> 00:33:36.019
In addition, new technologies have made possible expanded use of video in the field and at meetings.

00:33:36.019 --> 00:33:41.019
And how we enjoyed that facet at our recent regional conventions.

00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:53.019
That's a promise something here. And we're in Isaiah 59, 21, perhaps just go over to chapter 60 so that you see the spirit behind what your hope is doing here.

00:33:53.019 --> 00:34:01.019
And we're just as brothers plain mentioned, cooking this up because he's the one providing it.

00:34:01.019 --> 00:34:09.460
Isaiah 60, just the first part, verse 17, instead of the copper, I will bring in gold.

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:15.460
And instead of the iron, I will bring in silver. Nothing wrong with the copper.

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:22.460
Nothing bad about the iron. It's just improving. That's all.

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:32.460
So we've witnessed good become even better. Here's some examples recent years redesign JW dot org website.

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:44.699
Better. Watch tower online library. Better. The ever expanding and improving JW library.

00:34:44.699 --> 00:34:53.699
Better. JW broadcasting. How the brotherhood loves this provision.

00:34:53.699 --> 00:35:03.699
Now, unequivocally, there's no denying that Jehovah's people and it's really very clear in these last days.

00:35:03.699 --> 00:35:13.699
We are really fulfilling the scripture to preach the good news of the kingdom and all the inhabit the earth for a witness to all the nations and then Jehovah's bring it to the end.

00:35:13.699 --> 00:35:21.699
And we've done well at that for many years. However, note what the head of the congregation said.

00:35:21.699 --> 00:35:27.699
You know this, but it's something that we want you to consider in Matthew chapter 28.

00:35:27.699 --> 00:35:46.849
Matthew chapter 28. And this is something that Jehovah's made sure we've observed.

00:35:46.849 --> 00:35:57.289
Matthew 28. 19 and 20. It's where the resurrected Christ said go.

00:35:57.289 --> 00:36:07.289
Therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

00:36:07.289 --> 00:36:14.289
Notice teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.

00:36:14.289 --> 00:36:23.289
And look, I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things teaching.

00:36:23.289 --> 00:36:35.289
So it's been observed that further training is needed in teaching and Jehovah's organization to make disciples.

00:36:35.289 --> 00:36:41.289
So what changes are in store.

00:36:41.289 --> 00:36:48.289
Well, to combine these resources in order to address these needs.

00:36:48.289 --> 00:36:57.289
The governing body is pleased to announce that effective the week of January 4, 2016.

00:36:57.289 --> 00:37:39.590
Theocratic ministry school service meeting and congregation Bible study are all being replaced by a new meeting called our Christian life and ministry.

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:48.219
So get used to the idea that it's midweek meeting weekend meeting now.

00:37:48.219 --> 00:38:02.980
Additionally, the publication our kingdom ministry is being replaced by our Christian life and ministry meeting workbook.

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:22.780
And you'll see one on the screen momentarily.

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:29.780
David, I wish you could see some of these faces, David.

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:33.780
See, these are folks that go way, way, way, way back.

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:38.780
So we're glad you applauded.

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:47.780
Even though some are like, no kingdom ministry, oh my.

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:54.780
It's going to be okay. You'll see it is, it is all better.

00:38:54.780 --> 00:39:14.769
Now, in addition, you'll notice on the first page of the January 2016 life and ministry meeting workbook that there's no suggested magazine presentation for the awake.

00:39:14.769 --> 00:39:28.769
The reason is because the governing body decided that starting in January 2016, the magazines for the public will be published by monthly, that is every two months.

00:39:28.769 --> 00:39:42.489
Beginning in January 2016, we will offer one magazine to the public each month alternating between the watch tower and awake.

00:39:42.489 --> 00:39:56.139
In January, we'll offer the watch tower during February, we will feature subjects in awake and so on.

00:39:56.139 --> 00:40:03.139
Have you ever felt that a certain subject, especially appeals to people in your territory?

00:40:03.139 --> 00:40:15.139
You'd like to continue offering the magazine months after the issue date has passed, but you hold back because the date could give the impression that the information is all.

00:40:15.139 --> 00:40:34.440
You'll be happy to know that a date will no longer be printed on the covers.

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:39.440
Instead, the magazines will be identified by a number as you saw on the screen.

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:55.440
We're confident that these adjustments, you're going to offer life giving information in these journals with renewed enthusiasm in order to reach the hearts of a broad range of people in your territory.

00:40:55.440 --> 00:41:10.159
Now, here to explain some of the features of this new arrangement, our two helpers to the teaching committee, brothers Ronald Kerzan and David Schaefer.

00:41:10.159 --> 00:41:12.159
That was an announcement.

00:41:12.159 --> 00:41:20.159
The change in the midweek meeting is huge and it's not just a modification, a few little tweaks. It's a whole new beginning.

00:41:20.159 --> 00:41:26.159
True. So now the big question is, what can we expect from the midweek meeting?

00:41:26.159 --> 00:41:31.159
Well, here's a quick breakdown of the three main sections.

00:41:31.159 --> 00:41:35.159
First, we have treasures from God's word.

00:41:35.159 --> 00:41:42.159
Next, apply yourself to the field ministry and then living as Christians.

00:41:42.159 --> 00:41:44.159
So let's get started.

00:41:44.159 --> 00:41:47.159
First, treasures from God's word.

00:41:47.159 --> 00:41:57.159
This part begins with a 10 minute talk based on the weekly Bible reading, but what really makes the new meeting so special is the addition of our new workbook.

00:41:57.159 --> 00:41:58.159
Exactly.

00:41:58.159 --> 00:42:05.159
And look at how these illustrations match beautifully, the outline that's been provided for this talk.

00:42:05.159 --> 00:42:11.699
These include maps, the graphics, even videos.

00:42:11.699 --> 00:42:14.699
And introduction to the book of Ezra.

00:42:14.699 --> 00:42:19.699
The book was written by Ezra, a priest from the family line of Aaron.

00:42:19.699 --> 00:42:21.699
Ezra was a man of faith.

00:42:21.699 --> 00:42:31.699
All of these provisions will help us to visualize what's going on in these Bible accounts to understand it and keep it burning brightly in our memories.

00:42:31.699 --> 00:42:38.699
Excellent. Can't wait to watch those videos. Up next is digging for spiritual gems. I just love that title.

00:42:38.699 --> 00:42:46.699
What can we expect in this part? Well, this is an active audience discussion based on the week's Bible reading eight minutes.

00:42:46.699 --> 00:42:52.699
These two parts are like receiving precious gems of Gilead training one week at a time.

00:42:52.699 --> 00:42:55.699
And then we close out this section with a Bible reading.

00:42:55.699 --> 00:43:01.699
So there we have our treasures from God's word, but now what's the best way to share them?

00:43:01.699 --> 00:43:04.699
This is where the next part comes in this section.

00:43:04.699 --> 00:43:08.699
It is entitled, apply yourself to the field ministry.

00:43:08.699 --> 00:43:19.699
And the beauty of this part is that all the source material for the student of time assignments is the literature that will be featuring that week, that month in the field ministry.

00:43:19.699 --> 00:43:20.699
Now that makes perfect sense.

00:43:20.699 --> 00:43:27.699
Now let me ask you, how do you feel when you have an opportunity to watch a video at the Kingdom Hall?

00:43:27.699 --> 00:43:32.699
Personally, I love watching all the videos and I'm sure the audience does as well.

00:43:32.699 --> 00:43:40.699
So first meeting every month will have a chance to see three videos focusing on the current literature presentations.

00:43:40.699 --> 00:43:53.130
Excellent. Would you like to see a sneak peek? We know you would. Let's watch.

00:43:53.130 --> 00:44:06.289
Good morning. My name is Cassie and this is my friend Laura. May I ask your name? I'm Susan. Nice to meet you, Susan.

00:44:06.289 --> 00:44:07.289
You too.

00:44:07.289 --> 00:44:14.289
You have a beautiful home here. I can tell that you put a lot of effort into making it look so nice.

00:44:14.289 --> 00:44:17.289
Thank you. I enjoy working on it.

00:44:17.289 --> 00:44:25.289
It certainly shows. I'm here today because I'd like your opinion on this thought from God's word, the Bible.

00:44:25.289 --> 00:44:35.289
Do you think that the world would be a better place if everyone lived by this principle? Notice. We wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things.

00:44:35.289 --> 00:44:38.289
Yes. That's a good rule to live by.

00:44:38.289 --> 00:44:48.289
It sure is. And notice that the Bible encourages us to be honest in all things. So honesty touches every aspect of our life.

00:44:48.289 --> 00:44:54.289
In fact, that's the topic of this month's issue of the watch tower. Would you like to read this?

00:44:54.289 --> 00:44:55.289
Okay.

00:44:55.289 --> 00:45:02.289
And the next time I'm here, we can talk about whether there'll ever be a time when all people will be honest.

00:45:02.289 --> 00:45:04.289
That sounds good.

00:45:04.289 --> 00:45:16.659
Well, that was fantastic. We knew that you would enjoy that. It was so simple, so easy to remember.

00:45:16.659 --> 00:45:18.659
But what can we expect for the rest of the month?

00:45:18.659 --> 00:45:22.659
So for the rest of the meetings that month, second, third, fourth, sometimes fifth week,

00:45:22.659 --> 00:45:27.659
we'll have student assignments centered on one of the following settings.

00:45:27.659 --> 00:45:29.659
Initial call.

00:45:29.659 --> 00:45:31.659
Making the return visit.

00:45:31.659 --> 00:45:34.659
Conducting a Bible study.

00:45:34.659 --> 00:45:43.659
I love this section because we'll be watching videos. We'll be having presentations from the students with all this great content.

00:45:43.659 --> 00:45:48.659
What if there's an interesting point that I want to make note of and write down no problem at all?

00:45:48.659 --> 00:45:53.659
The workbook has been designed with more space for taking personal notes.

00:45:53.659 --> 00:46:00.659
In fact, on the front of the workbook, you even have a area where you can create your own field service presentation.

00:46:00.659 --> 00:46:04.659
In review, section one, we have our treasure.

00:46:04.659 --> 00:46:08.659
Section two, we're sharing that treasure with others.

00:46:08.659 --> 00:46:15.659
And section three is equally vital because all of this knowledge would be wasted if we were not applying it.

00:46:15.659 --> 00:46:19.659
Thus, the third section is entitled Living as Christians.

00:46:19.659 --> 00:46:21.659
And what will this be?

00:46:21.659 --> 00:46:24.659
So we have an opportunity to hear some talks. Watch more videos.

00:46:24.659 --> 00:46:26.659
Question and answer discussion.

00:46:26.659 --> 00:46:32.659
All centered on focusing on Bible principles and how they apply in our modern lives.

00:46:32.659 --> 00:46:33.659
Love the sound of that.

00:46:33.659 --> 00:46:36.659
So here we've given you a general overview.

00:46:36.659 --> 00:46:41.659
Gone over the three main sections, but we haven't delved into every detail.

00:46:41.659 --> 00:46:43.659
And there's a reason for that.

00:46:43.659 --> 00:46:52.659
Because the governing body has approved the release of a full length sample life and ministry meeting video

00:46:52.659 --> 00:46:55.659
to be posted on JW Broadcasting.

00:46:55.659 --> 00:46:58.659
And it'll be available this afternoon.

00:46:58.659 --> 00:47:19.469
You'll be able to watch the whole thing in real time and see how each of the parts flow.

00:47:19.469 --> 00:47:23.469
I know we are all excited to watch that this afternoon.

00:47:23.469 --> 00:47:33.469
You will also be happy to know that our Christian life and ministry meeting workbook will be provided in electronic formats on jw.org

00:47:33.469 --> 00:47:38.469
in the watch tower online library and the jw library app.

00:47:38.469 --> 00:47:40.469
And what about those printed editions?

00:47:40.469 --> 00:47:45.469
Well, those will be coming through the congregations in the usual way.

00:47:45.469 --> 00:47:53.469
And yet, you'll be happy to know that everyone in attendance here at this annual meeting will be receiving their own printed edition.

00:47:53.469 --> 00:47:57.469
In fact, our attendance have already started handing them out.

00:47:57.469 --> 00:48:32.670
Now, as you get your printed edition and you look at the front page, you'll notice that the sample presentations contain just a few key words.

00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:38.670
And I like how simple those key words are. They'll help us to remember the presentations, definitely.

00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:39.670
Yes.

00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:44.670
And something else that you'll notice is the...

00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:48.670
This is what I love about this.

00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:50.670
Inside.

00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:52.670
You know what I forgot to say?

00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:58.219
Thanks, Dave.

00:48:58.219 --> 00:49:07.219
What I love about this is that on the front cover is that we have those little thumbnails of the January watch tower and the January literature offer.

00:49:07.219 --> 00:49:09.219
Now, these are so handy.

00:49:09.219 --> 00:49:17.219
You know, when I, in the days past, when I was preparing for my field service in the morning, I'd have my kingdom ministry with the sample presentation.

00:49:17.219 --> 00:49:27.219
I'd look for the corresponding magazine, but it wouldn't always be the one that was referred to in the kingdom ministry because the sample presentation was for the magazine of the following month.

00:49:27.219 --> 00:49:29.219
Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.

00:49:29.219 --> 00:49:39.219
Now, the January meeting workbook or the MWB has the presentation for the January watch tower and it's print right there in the front cover.

00:49:39.219 --> 00:49:49.219
In addition, if you look at this meeting schedule, it gives information that pertains only to the meetings that will be held during that calendar month.

00:49:49.219 --> 00:49:59.219
So now the January workbook would feature only the January watch tower, the January literature offer, and the January meeting schedules.

00:49:59.219 --> 00:50:01.219
How practical is that?

00:50:01.219 --> 00:50:02.219
Absolutely.

00:50:02.219 --> 00:50:16.800
And then, notice the color coding on each of the aspects of the meeting. There's a method to that.

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:20.800
So, silver for treasures from God's word.

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:28.800
We've color for apply yourself to the field ministry and burgundy color for living as Christians.

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:36.800
And the color corresponds to the color bar at the top of other articles that will be used during that part of the meeting.

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:40.800
Well, that will really help us to follow along during the meeting.

00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:43.800
So, we have our printed editions of the workbook.

00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:46.800
We have our workbook on the JW Library app.

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:48.800
But let me ask you.

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:56.800
Did you ever feel that the JW Library app would be a little more useful if you could highlight portions of text?

00:50:56.800 --> 00:51:14.780
That seems like a resounding yes.

00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:20.780
And yet, that is not an easy thing to bring about.

00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:29.780
Nevertheless, you'll be happy to know that next month, when you go to the JW Library app,

00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:56.159
you'll be able to find the meeting workbook, scroll to the appropriate section, tap any link, and highlight the text right in the app.

00:51:56.159 --> 00:51:58.159
Can't wait to make use of that.

00:51:58.159 --> 00:52:04.159
What an awesome privilege it is for all of us to be part of such a progressive organization.

00:52:04.159 --> 00:52:05.159
Totally agree.

00:52:05.159 --> 00:52:18.159
The new meeting, the meeting workbook, the updated app, all give evidence that Jehovah is our grand instructor and that he equips us with everything we need to do his will.

00:52:18.159 --> 00:52:45.070
Jehovah knows the power of visual teaching and the new life and ministry meeting captures that power and brings the Bible to life with beautiful illustrations and videos.

00:52:45.070 --> 00:52:56.070
As I mentioned earlier, when we read portions of Isaiah 60, 17, Jehovah promised, instead of the copper, I will bring in gold.

00:52:56.070 --> 00:53:03.380
The copper was good, but the good just got even better.

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:14.050
In these last days, we all need to keep our spiritual focus sharper than ever.

00:53:15.050 --> 00:53:26.050
We're going to conclude this part and quote pages or paragraphs on page 230 of the Kingdom Rules book.

00:53:26.050 --> 00:53:35.050
Very sobering comments and sounds it up nicely when we think of the monumental historic change.

00:53:35.050 --> 00:53:43.050
Paragraph 19, how can we prepare ourselves for the earth shaking events that are to come?

00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:50.050
The watchtower stated some years ago, survival will depend on obedience.

00:53:50.050 --> 00:53:53.050
Why is that so?

00:53:53.050 --> 00:54:00.050
The answer is found in a warning from Jehovah to the captive Jews living in ancient Babylon.

00:54:00.050 --> 00:54:09.050
Jehovah foretold that Babylon would be conquered, but what were God's people to do to prepare themselves for that event?

00:54:09.050 --> 00:54:13.050
Jehovah stated, go, my people.

00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:25.050
Enter your inner rooms and shut your doors behind you, hide yourself for a brief moment until the wrath is passed by.

00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:32.050
Note the verbs in this verse, go, enter, shut, hide.

00:54:32.050 --> 00:54:38.050
All are in the imperative mood. They are commands.

00:54:38.050 --> 00:54:45.050
The Jews who heated those commands would have stayed in their houses away from the conquering soldiers out in the streets.

00:54:45.050 --> 00:54:50.050
Hence, their survival will depend on obeying Jehovah's instructions.

00:54:50.050 --> 00:54:57.050
And paragraph 20 starts with the question, what is the lesson for us?

00:54:57.050 --> 00:55:07.050
As in the case of those ancient servants of God, our survival of coming events will depend on our obedience to Jehovah's instructions.

00:55:07.050 --> 00:55:14.050
Such instructions come to us through the congregation arrangement.

00:55:14.050 --> 00:55:22.050
Therefore, we want to develop heartfelt obedience to the guidance we are receiving.

00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:34.050
If we do so today, we will be more inclined to be willingly in the future and thus receive the protection of our Father Jehovah and our King Jesus.

00:55:34.050 --> 00:55:42.050
That divine protection will allow us to witness firsthand how God's kingdom will completely remove its enemies.

00:55:42.050 --> 00:55:46.050
What an unforgettable event that will be.

00:55:46.050 --> 00:55:52.519
Yes, brothers, these are truly exciting times.

00:55:52.519 --> 00:55:58.519
Jehovah's speeding up the work, each of us needs strong faith to survive the last days.

00:55:58.519 --> 00:56:10.519
It is our prayer that our revised meeting arrangement will help each of us to carry out our Christian life in ministry all to Jehovah's praise.

00:56:10.519 --> 00:56:25.210
Well, was that historic enough for you?

00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:34.210
And what a wonderful advantage we will have now when we are talking to our Bible students or return visits and trying to encourage them to go to the meetings.

00:56:34.210 --> 00:56:39.210
We used to scare the life out of them by saying, there are five meetings a week.

00:56:39.210 --> 00:56:49.210
But now we'll say, Jehovah's witnesses have two meetings every week, one midweek meeting and then a meeting toward the weekend.

00:56:49.210 --> 00:56:53.210
And that's going to be a little bit more comfortable for the people.

00:56:53.210 --> 00:57:01.210
Now, one of the highlights of any annual meeting is the interview of longtime servants of Jehovah.

00:57:01.210 --> 00:57:08.210
And a few weeks ago, brother Samuel heard sat down with a few of them, their experiences are fascinating.

00:57:08.210 --> 00:57:11.210
You are going to enjoy this part.

00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:16.210
I would like to introduce all of you to our interviewees.

00:57:16.210 --> 00:57:23.210
All have been in full time service for at least 47 years and of course some much longer than that.

00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:33.210
We are at JR Brown from Brooklyn and we have Alan Janssen and Richard Eldridge and Ray Richardson are all based in Patterson.

00:57:33.210 --> 00:57:36.210
And finally, Herman Van Sam and Brooklyn.

00:57:36.210 --> 00:57:39.210
First, we'll talk to brother Brown.

00:57:39.210 --> 00:57:45.210
I show you having been in some form of full time service for over 57 years.

00:57:45.210 --> 00:57:50.210
Now, what forms of service have you enjoyed over the years, brother Brown?

00:57:50.210 --> 00:58:00.210
Well, a variety of different forms from traveling work after a pioneering and then special pioneer work.

00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:07.210
And then of course, circuit work and then district work before it was done away with.

00:58:07.210 --> 00:58:10.210
All of it has been most enjoyable.

00:58:10.210 --> 00:58:20.210
Now, back in those days, brother Brown, the circuit overseers, they used to call them colored circuit overseers, the day is black.

00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:25.210
But the black circuit overseers just serve black congregations, is that right?

00:58:25.210 --> 00:58:30.210
They started in the south integrating things.

00:58:30.210 --> 00:58:40.210
We had circuit number 30. So all throughout the south, they had a different number in system for black circuits.

00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:49.210
And when you serve the congregation, while it was not integrated as yet, that is initially when we went there.

00:58:49.210 --> 00:58:55.210
You could see the friends were eager to have integration just to give you an example brother.

00:58:55.210 --> 00:59:12.460
And when I would come to the congregation to serve, and they were all black congregations, then the white friends from the other congregation, they would come to the back of the hall, open the door.

00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:23.460
Or they would open the windows and set the speaker so outside of the hall, you could hear what was going on and answer the questions based on the discussion that you had.

00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:33.460
So while, in fact, it was segregation, it was really a way to unite the brothers and bring them together.

00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:48.460
Very interesting. We think back over all those years, and how many people accepted the truth, despite the fact that the world is so divided, when they're able to see the truth, they do something about it.

00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:53.460
And you had a privilege of being very much involved in that.

00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:58.460
But now let's move forward to your Bethler life, just what are you doing presently?

00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:04.460
Well, presently, I'm with the Department of Public Information.

01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:15.460
And you know, it used to be where all of the questions that would come in, I was in writing correspondence, and they would just give all those questions to writing correspondence.

01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:24.460
Well, it got to be so much, it just was no way that the one or two brothers in writing correspondence can handle it all.

01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:31.460
And so the petition was made to the writing department.

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:42.460
This needs to be set up to handle the media, because the media now was more and more aggressive, and they wanted to have more and more to say about the witness and what they believe.

01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:51.460
And as soon as you have that out, then somebody's going to stand up and say, yes, I'm an expert on Jehovah's Witnesses. Please give me a call.

01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:55.460
How did you come in contact with the truth, Brother Brown?

01:00:55.460 --> 01:01:07.460
It started with my mother, who was a patient for tuberculosis, and so while she was there under treatments for the TB, as they called it.

01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:15.460
And she started studying the truth with a sister who came by the hospital, conducted the study with her.

01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:25.460
And so she had always said, well, when she got out of there or got home, she was going to teach her children, which would have been the three of us.

01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:33.460
The truth has the Bible presented it. Her style was very simple. She just said every Sunday.

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:43.460
She called her children and set them down in front of her with the book, The Kingdom Is At Hand, and she read portions from that and explained it.

01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:56.460
And of course, that reached my heart, and I think the heart of my brothers, because it made all want to know more about this kingdom that was going to rule over everything.

01:01:56.460 --> 01:02:09.460
Well, thank you very much, Brother Brown, we sure appreciate getting a view of your history hearing how things went back years ago, and we're so happy you're still serving faithfully today, you and your wife.

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:23.460
So we thank you. Now to Brother Adjansson, I check the records and they indicate that you have been in some form a full time service for 47 years. Can you break that down for us?

01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:34.460
Well, I spent six years pioneering in New York and New Jersey, and then six years in the circuit work in Oklahoma, Ohio, and Michigan.

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:47.460
And then in October of 1980, we got called into Bethel, and so we've been serving at Bethel for the last 35 years, and I've worked in the convention office mainly, and now I'm working in the local design construction.

01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:56.460
Or LDC, I'm trying to remember what all these new letter designation stand for.

01:02:56.460 --> 01:03:00.460
If you don't mind me asking, how old are you?

01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:06.460
Well, let me put it this way. If we were still in circuit work, I'd be out of a job for about a month now.

01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:08.460
You're old.

01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:16.460
But that's fair enough. I think we can figure that one out. How did you and your family find the truth?

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:25.460
My paternal grandmother got the truth first. She was of the anointed, and I never met her. She got her heavenly calling before I came along.

01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:34.460
But she brought my dad into the truth, and my dad pioneered all up and down the East Coast from New York to Georgia.

01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:41.460
And then to Mary, he married only in the Lord. He met my mom, and he studied with her.

01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:51.460
And then once she was in the Lord, then she joined him, pioneering. They continued pioneering from New York through Georgia, and they made their own trailers.

01:03:51.460 --> 01:04:03.460
In those days, you had to trade for literature. They would trade soap, coupons, canned peaches, even chickens were a common contribution for the literature.

01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:08.460
And they used to have to catch them, and then put them in the coup behind the car.

01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:22.460
But they continued to pioneering until my brother was about five, and then they settled into Yonkers, New York, and then they brought up my brother, myself, and my sister in the truth.

01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:28.460
It's certainly commendable that you've been able to stay in full-time service for 47 years.

01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:35.460
What have been some challenges you faced, and how did things work out?

01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:46.460
Well, one challenge was coming to Bethel, and as you can tell, we've adapted to it now, partly because a good friend of ours said, Bloom, we're your planet.

01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:52.460
So, though it was a big adjustment, we enjoyed circuit work, and we now enjoy Bethel's service.

01:04:52.460 --> 01:05:03.460
I don't understand. You say being called to Bethel was a challenge, but a person has to turn in an application, doesn't he? In order to come to Bethel?

01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:11.460
Well, well, now wait a minute. If you wanted to stay in the circuit work, why did you turn in a Bethel application?

01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:21.460
Well, we really didn't turn one in right away. My wife and I, what we said, was we didn't really want to apply for Bethel.

01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:31.460
But if we were ever called, we would give it a try. We didn't think anybody was listening to the conversation.

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:45.460
So, we were mining our own business, serving the congregation out in Lansing, Michigan, and out of the Clear Blue Sky, where the Joel Adams called us on September 25th, 1980, and asked if we were ready for a little bit of a surprise.

01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:55.460
We said that a department at Bethel had called us and wanted us to come in, and then he went on and said, you ready for a little more of a surprise?

01:05:55.460 --> 01:06:08.460
He said, we would like you here by October 1st, just five days later. So, we kept our word, we came in, and we filled out Bethel applications after we arrived.

01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:16.460
Now, do you have any other challenges that you faced over the years?

01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:26.460
Probably the death of loved ones, parents, my brother, then my sister died, and she left two children, our nephews.

01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:37.460
And so, that was going to be a real challenge. They were teenagers at the time. And so, we didn't know if we were going to have to leave special services, if we were going to have to take care of our fleshly family.

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:49.460
We were involved in a lot of prayer, but because we wanted to continue on serving also at Bethel, and then our niece came forward, and she said that the boys could live with them.

01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:55.460
Well, they've grown up now, they're on their own, and yet we're still in Bethel service.

01:06:55.460 --> 01:07:05.460
Thank you very much for sharing your experiences with us. And now, Brother Eldridge, as of September 1st of this year,

01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:11.460
you have 47 years of full-time service. Where have you served?

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:28.460
I regular pioneered for two years in Washington State, and then came into Wallkill, where I served for just a little over 20 years, and then transferred to the Watchtower Educational Center in Patterson 24 and a half years ago.

01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:36.460
I know you've worked with engineering and permitting of construction projects for decades. What department are you with now?

01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:48.460
Construction design development documentation. Now, here we go again. I have to learn more letters.

01:07:48.460 --> 01:08:00.460
I guess that is CDDD department. Tell us how it is that you became a witness so many years ago.

01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:16.460
Well, my grandfather and parents played a part. My parents were close to an elderly company servant, and his wife, who both professed to be of the anointed a member studying by coal lamp at their home, they had no electricity.

01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:28.460
Then in 1952, my mother decided my brother and I needed a more formal study, so she asked a couple of brothers from the congregation to come over and study with us.

01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:43.460
I symbolized my dedication in 1956, and as I progressed in school, I was getting high marks, and counselors were encouraging me to sign up for college scholarships, which I turned down.

01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:52.460
Explaining instead, my goal was to spend a hundred hours or more a month talking to my neighbors about the good news of the kingdom.

01:08:52.460 --> 01:09:06.460
Well, as things progressed, I did get out of school about that time. The Vietnam conflict was ramping up, and so I took my stand for neutrality.

01:09:06.460 --> 01:09:15.460
And first, as a conscientious objector, and later was given the exemption as a minister once I was a regular pioneer.

01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:25.460
Well, you certainly made the right choice, the right career. And speaking of engineering and property planning, what stands out in your mind?

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:42.460
Experiences have to do with what I perceive to be seeing Jehovah's Holy Spirit in action. Both the Wal-Kill and Patterson have worked with the permitting process under the direction of brothers like Max Larson, George Couch, and Lawn Shilling.

01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:53.460
In the early days, they would encourage us to get to know the government officials, invite them for tours. That worked well for Wal-Kill, and later for Patterson.

01:09:53.460 --> 01:10:02.460
The officials were appreciative of the way the Watchtower Farms property was kept up and made it easier for them to approve our projects.

01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:10.460
And now to see what is happening at warwick is a further evidence of Jehovah's blessing upon our arrangements.

01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:17.460
Thank you, and we'll get another comment from you a little later on.

01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:36.460
We would now like to get to know brother Raymond Richardson. According to the records that you have accumulated 56 years of full-time service, 15 years of pioneering and all told 41 years and Bethel service.

01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:41.460
Where do you presently work, brother Richardson, and what does that entail?

01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:55.460
Well, I work in the writing correspondence department for the last 37 years. And as the title of the department indicates, we work under the oversight of the writing committee.

01:10:55.460 --> 01:11:02.460
And we answer phone calls and letters that come from witnesses and non-witnesses alike.

01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:19.460
But the questions are really Bible questions about matters of doctrine, why are publications said what it did, employment issues, and chronology, and the list goes on and on.

01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:24.460
Sounds like fascinating work. I take it you like books.

01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:33.460
Yes, almost to a fault sometimes. I'll just give you an example. My wife and I have been at Bethel for a number of years.

01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:42.460
And I reached a point where I saved $60 and promised Pat that I would take her away for a weekend to relax.

01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:50.460
Well, as we were driving out of the city, we passed by a bookstore that I had never seen before.

01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:59.460
At the time, I was really searching for a specific set of commentaries to help me with a project that I was working on.

01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:16.460
Well, I went into a just look. And here was that set that I've been looking for. And it was on sale from $200 down to, you guessed it, $60.

01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:24.460
Well, I was hooked, bought the set, and I ended up in the dog house at home for that weekend.

01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:32.460
Well, that following Monday, Brother Carl Klein of the governing body asked me why I look so down.

01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:42.460
So I explained to him what had happened during the weekend. And I said, I just seemed to be like somebody that just buys on impulse.

01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:53.460
Well, Brother Klein looked at me for a while. And then he reached into a drawer in his desk and pulled out $60.

01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:56.460
And he says, take it.

01:12:56.460 --> 01:13:04.460
See, tell your wife that this shows that the Lord takes care of those who buy on impulse for his work.

01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:11.460
Well, we both had a good laugh and I did it through tears of gratitude.

01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:19.460
Well, gradually, I got out of the dog house and we used that $60 to take a weekend away.

01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:26.460
Well, it sounds like you have a thing for books like some sisters have for shoes.

01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:33.460
Tell us how you came to know the truth and be baptized.

01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:40.460
Well, the witnesses were calling on my grandparents. So from time to time, because of that, I met different witnesses.

01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:45.460
And they invited me to their meetings and to some of their social gatherings.

01:13:46.460 --> 01:14:01.460
When I was with them, I was so impressed by the love that they showed the unity and peacefulness of different races and different backgrounds to the point that I became very curious.

01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:09.460
Well, this led to me wanting to be like them. And they said, first, you got to read and study two books.

01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:17.460
So I got busy. I completed the books. I got baptized and shortly after that began pioneering.

01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:31.460
My dad became enraged when he found out that I had turned down a full scholarship to a nearby university to pioneer or, as he said, pedal your magazines on the street.

01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:38.460
He was so upset that he wanted to throw me out of the house, but my mother begged for him, don't do it.

01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:44.460
But it was a very hostile atmosphere that remained in the house.

01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:49.460
So I thought it would be better for me to apply for a battle.

01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:56.460
Well, I was accepted in 1960 and assigned to the Brooklyn Heights congregation.

01:14:56.460 --> 01:15:01.460
Tell us, did your father ever change his attitude about the truth?

01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:08.460
You know, when I went to Bethel, I left Watchtower and Awake magazines all over the house.

01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:17.460
My dad thought I would be back in a year. When that didn't happen, he began to read some of those magazines.

01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:27.460
Now, when I had my first vacation back home, I was just dreading as to what his reaction would be.

01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:35.460
Well, I was totally surprised to find out that his attitude had changed dramatically.

01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:42.460
It was to the point where he even helped the local brothers build a new kingdom hall.

01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:48.460
And thankfully, we again had a loving father-son relationship.

01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:56.460
Even though he died a year later for leukemia, he was on his way to get baptized.

01:15:56.460 --> 01:16:02.460
He was devoted and was in total unity with me and doing Jehovah's will.

01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:06.460
That shows us how powerful those magazines really are.

01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:11.460
I know I like to read them and I know our brothers and sisters enjoy them too.

01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:22.460
So after four years of Bethel, you got married, but back at that time, it was pretty much a forced reassignment to the field.

01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:30.460
How long were you out of Bethel and did the reassignment to the field work for you?

01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:36.460
Well, we were assigned to pioneer in a rough section of Brooklyn.

01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:41.460
Now, that was from that vantage point, it was a challenge.

01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:44.460
But the results were thrilling.

01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:51.460
In five years, we saw 22 of our students change their lives and get baptized.

01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:59.460
In the 14 years that we pioneered together, we had the privilege of seeing 52 of our students

01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:01.460
come into the truth.

01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:07.460
So as Dan Sidley would say, so there is life after Bethel.

01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:09.460
We thank you, Ray.

01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:12.460
We'll come back to you in a few minutes.

01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:20.460
Brother Van Sound, I understand that you crested 50 years of full-time service last month.

01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:26.460
How did you get the truth and what avenues of service have you enjoyed?

01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:31.460
I was born in the Netherlands in a town not too far from the city of Rotterdam.

01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:36.460
And when I was about 10 years old, my mother began to study the Bible with me.

01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:40.460
And shortly thereafter, my father also became a witness.

01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:44.460
And they served Jehovah very faithfully until their death.

01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:49.460
I served as a regular and special pioneer for eight years.

01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:57.460
And during that time, I also spent one and a half years in prison because of the neutrality issue.

01:17:57.460 --> 01:18:02.460
Then after prison, I was invited directly into the Netherlands battle.

01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:05.460
No bars on the window there, thankfully.

01:18:05.460 --> 01:18:12.460
And then in 1973, I attended the class number 56 of the Giliat School.

01:18:12.460 --> 01:18:18.460
And thereafter, I had the pleasure of serving as a missionary in Suriname, Guyana and Brazil

01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:20.460
for 24 years.

01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:26.460
And then in December 1997, my wife and I were invited to come to Brooklyn-Betzel,

01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:31.460
where I have been serving in the writing department now for 18 years.

01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:34.460
That's quite a record of theocratic activity.

01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:42.460
Can you give us the short story of one of your experiences serving as a missionary in Suriname and Guyana?

01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:50.460
Well, in 1980, my wife Kay and I moved to a very isolated assignment on an Amar Indian reservation

01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:56.460
of about 2,000 people in the rainforest of Suriname and Guyana.

01:18:56.460 --> 01:19:00.460
There were no witnesses there. There was no telephone connection.

01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:04.460
The nearest congregation was 12 hours away by boat.

01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:09.460
Now, about once a month, the brands would send us a little parcel with our personal mail.

01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:13.460
And you can imagine the data that those letters arrived were a feast.

01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:18.460
We would drop everything and savor slowly each letter.

01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:26.460
So during the five years that we lived there in isolation, prayer, became more important in our life than ever before.

01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:30.460
Now, when we began the preaching work there, there was little response.

01:19:30.460 --> 01:19:33.460
And we prayed and prayed for good Bible studies.

01:19:33.460 --> 01:19:43.460
After a while, some individuals began to study, more followed, and then before long, between the two of us, we had 25 Bible studies.

01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:51.460
Now, after a while, we invited our Bible studies to come along with us to their first convention in the capital city.

01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:57.460
Now, it would be a long trip by boat and by bus. So we were wondering how many will come along?

01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:06.460
So when the time of departure came in the middle of the night, we boarded a small boat about a size of a battle shuttle bus.

01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:09.460
Now, it was dark, so we had no idea how many were in the boat.

01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:18.460
But when the sun came up, we were amazed to see that about 45 of our Bible students had decided to come along. The boat was chock full.

01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:24.460
Now, at the convention, we had a joy that several of our Bible students were baptized.

01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:30.460
I'm so happy to tell that today there are two congregations in that isolated area.

01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:37.460
Thank you. I know you have many more exciting experiences from that time period.

01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:43.460
Maybe we can include them in a future JW Broadcasting video.

01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:46.460
We'll get another comment from you a little later.

01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:49.460
Let's go back to Brother Brown.

01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:56.460
Please describe how you feel about Jehovah's organization and being part of it.

01:20:56.460 --> 01:21:02.460
Well, my feelings are very evident by the life that we live.

01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:07.460
There's nothing that we enjoy more than the special full-time service.

01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:12.460
And this is why we're glad that this decision was made while we were young.

01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:15.460
And we have no regrets to this day.

01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:21.460
And that Jehovah has blessed us to continue in it for 57 years now.

01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:27.460
Thank you so much, Richard. We appreciate you getting just a little taste of your history.

01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:31.460
And now, Brother Johnson, the same question.

01:21:31.460 --> 01:21:35.460
How do you feel about being a part of the organization?

01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:42.460
There's no question in my mind that Jehovah is using this organization to accomplish his will.

01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:47.460
And to be a part of it is a privilege beyond compare.

01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:50.460
I want to continue to remain loyal.

01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:55.460
And when the organization says jump, I want to say, how high?

01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:59.460
Okay. Just don't jump to a conclusion.

01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:03.460
We want you around for many more years to come.

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:06.460
Now, Brother Alger, back to you.

01:22:06.460 --> 01:22:10.460
How do you feel about being a part of this organization?

01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:18.460
Well, recently we had a Bible reading in 2 Samuel chapter 15 that included the alien dweller, Etai,

01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:23.460
who proved so loyal to David. David was fleeing for his life.

01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:29.460
David offered Etai in his family the opportunity to return to Jerusalem.

01:22:30.460 --> 01:22:35.460
Etai's declaration of unflinching loyalty rings out.

01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:39.460
He answers, in the place where my Lord the King may come to be,

01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:45.460
whether for death or for life, there is where your servant will come to be.

01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:50.460
For me, that sums up my view of remaining in the Christian congregation,

01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:57.460
maintaining loyalty and support to Jehovah, Christ Jesus, and the faithful slave.

01:22:57.460 --> 01:23:01.460
Thank you, Richard, and right back to you.

01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:07.460
After all of these years, how do you feel about Jehovah's organization?

01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:14.460
Well, the organization is Jehovah's way of providing spiritual direction for the whole household of faith.

01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:21.460
But he also does that for individuals, individuals like myself.

01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:31.460
Psalm 32, Jehovah says, I will give you advice with my eye on you.

01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:38.460
And Jehovah, it's like saying from Jehovah that he's watching you personally,

01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:47.460
and he will see to it through his organization that you get the best, helpful advice on whatever the issue.

01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:54.460
So it may come through an article in a magazine, perhaps from advice from my circuit overseer,

01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:57.460
or even a member of the governing body.

01:23:57.460 --> 01:24:05.460
No other organization on earth takes that type of concern for individuals.

01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:13.460
And that's why I feel very proud to be a part of an organization that cares for each person,

01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:21.460
a loving and warm family where everyone is cared for and appreciated.

01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:26.460
I'm sure all of us can say men do that, Ray.

01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:29.460
We want to thank you for your wonderful thoughts here.

01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:34.460
Now, Brother Van Sam, tell us how you feel about Jehovah's organization.

01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:39.460
One reason why I feel proud to be part of Jehovah's organization

01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:47.460
is that the faithful slave reflects Jehovah's concern for those who may view themselves as insignificant.

01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:54.460
Now, an example of Jehovah's concern that touched me is found in Genesis chapter 16,

01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:58.460
where we read the account of the servant girl, Hager.

01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:04.460
Now, she ran away from Sarai and then she sat down at the well in the wilderness and there she was.

01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:11.460
All by herself, totally abundant and insignificant slave without any friends.

01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:17.460
But then verse 7 says, Jehovah's angel found her.

01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:20.460
Note, the angel found her.

01:25:20.460 --> 01:25:25.460
Hager was so valuable in Jehovah's eyes that he sent an angel to search for her.

01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:26.460
Now, think of this.

01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:31.460
This is the first time that the expression Jehovah's angel appears in the Bible.

01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:41.460
Yet, Jehovah sent this angel not to a king, not to a queen, but to an insignificant servant girl.

01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:47.460
And then the angel said, Hager, he used her personal name.

01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:50.460
In Jehovah's eyes, she was valuable.

01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:55.460
Now, when Hager understood that comforting truth, she called out to Jehovah,

01:25:55.460 --> 01:25:58.460
you are a god of sight.

01:25:58.460 --> 01:26:06.460
Now, when I think of this account, it reminds me of how Jehovah's organization today shows similar concern.

01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:13.460
For example, by going to great length in printing literature, in indigenous languages,

01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:17.460
for people who are often viewed as insignificant.

01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:22.460
When we hand these publications to these humble people, we tell them in effect,

01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:25.460
Jehovah has found you.

01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:30.460
Or when we distribute our well-prepared publications to the blind and the deaf, we tell them,

01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:33.460
Jehovah has found you.

01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:39.460
And what a joy it is to observe that hundreds of thousands of these humble people say in response,

01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:43.460
Jehovah, you are a god of sight.

01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:49.460
I'm truly grateful to be part of an organization that shows loyal love to those in need.

01:26:49.460 --> 01:26:53.460
It's an organization that reflects Jehovah's qualities.

01:26:53.460 --> 01:27:03.460
We thank all of you, brothers, for spending some time with us and sharing some personal insights about your life as one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

01:27:03.460 --> 01:27:06.460
We agree with Proverbs 15, 30, and 31.

01:27:06.460 --> 01:27:10.460
It says, bright eyes make the heart rejoice.

01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:14.460
A good report invigorates the bones.

01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:20.460
The one who listens to life-giving proof is at home among the wise.

01:27:20.460 --> 01:27:25.460
We feel invigorated by your report and at home among the wise.

01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:28.460
Thank you very much.
