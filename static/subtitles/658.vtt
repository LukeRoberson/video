00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:08.300
This year, Lenaldron, I had the privilege to travel to Southeast Africa and visit the branches in Madagascar,

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:14.539
Mauritius and Zimbabwe. Our first stop was Madagascar.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:22.059
Madagascar is simply a wonderful branch for preaching. There are 30,400 publishers

00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:28.379
conducting over 79,000 Bible studies. And what helps is that the Madagascese people have a

00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:34.780
tremendous appreciation and respect for the Bible. It is not uncommon for individuals to give a

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.060
donation for our literature with the last bit of money they have in their pockets, even if it

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:46.060
means that they'll have no money for the next day. And their typical response is, it's okay,

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:54.299
it's for God. And that level of appreciation has resulted in many progressive Bible studies.

00:00:55.259 --> 00:01:01.020
One experience involved an elderly pastor named Lefty. He met Jehovah's Witnesses for the first

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.299
time in a neighboring village about 20 miles away from where he lived. He readily accepted a

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.659
Bible study and even urged members in his church to travel to the meetings with him when they could.

00:01:13.019 --> 00:01:21.180
Well, sadly, Lefty became sick and died. However, before his death, he instructed the 74 members

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.780
of his church that they should never leave Jehovah's Witnesses because they really read and study

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.260
the Bible and they truly have the true religion. He even left his house for them to use as a place

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:41.099
for worship. Well, did they heed his advice? They did. Every Sunday, a group would meet together in

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:46.939
Lefty's house and with no one to study the Bible with them and not always able to travel to 20

00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:52.299
miles to the neighboring village. They took whatever watchtowers they had and each week,

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.659
someone delivered a talk on one of the articles. They knew a few Kingdom songs from attending the

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.900
meetings so they just sung what they remembered. Two months ago, special pioneers were sent to

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.819
this village. This picture shows many of the children who live in the village and that's Lefty's

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.300
house in the background. The pioneers reported that 78 people were regularly attending the meetings

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.620
in Lefty's house. They found that some in the group were drunkards, smokers, tradition followers,

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:29.500
but they had all made changes in their lives from what they read reading the watchtower.

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:35.259
The house built by Lefty was now too small. They had to use a public school for the meetings.

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:40.860
And of course, when the pioneers came, Bible studies were started right away. In fact,

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.900
the folks in this village were so excited about studying the Bible that instead of waiting for

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.139
the pioneers to come to their home, they all went to the home of the pioneers. They sit in the yard

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:57.500
and they check in just like a doctor's office and they sit and wait until it's their turn to study.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.699
It really is a beautiful thing to see how Jehovah can draw his people to him.

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:09.819
One of the highlights of this visit were the children who came to the branch to sing or record

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:15.099
the malagassy rendition of song number 95, which is taste and sea, that Jehovah is good.

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:21.819
And as you know, this song was recently posted on JW.org, so we thought you might enjoy seeing part

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:22.620
of that rehearsal.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:04:28.449
Our next stop was Mauritius. The first Bethel and Mauritius were established in 1988,

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:34.610
but since 1997, they relocated to the beautiful facilities that you see here in the pictures.

00:04:35.329 --> 00:04:39.089
And there are 40 brothers and sisters that make up the Bethel family.

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:46.850
The women are truly a large army in Mauritius of the nearly 1800 publishers, 116 are pioneers

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:53.730
and of that number over 100 are sisters. They work so hard to carry out their ministry.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.850
And they engage in various forms from public witnessing to preaching in the mountains.

00:04:59.649 --> 00:05:04.449
And Jehovah is truly blessing their efforts. They are doing this with much good success.

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:10.769
Much of the work in the Mauritius branch involves translations and something that has had a

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:16.689
tremendous impact on the brothers was receiving for the first time the song book in their native

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:23.490
language, Mauritian Creole. And a number were able to express their feelings of appreciation.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.569
Jehovah has blessed us so much. I'm so grateful.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.329
Our final stop was in Bobway.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.009
The Bobway continues to be a buzz from the success of last year's international convention.

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:49.490
And evidence of this has been the amount of increase in many aspects of the ministry.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.490
This includes all-time peaks in magazine placements, Bible studies, and memorial attendants.

00:05:56.529 --> 00:06:00.529
One nice experience involves a 20-year-old young woman named Blessed.

00:06:01.329 --> 00:06:05.410
She obtained literature for one of our preaching cards and she was drawn to the truth right away.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:11.089
She was a progressive student and quickly began attending the meetings. In fact, Blessed was so

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:17.089
touched by what she saw and heard at the meetings. It moved her to approach a sister in the congregation

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.970
and expressed to her just how fortunate she was to be raised by Christian parents.

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:27.009
When Blessed was given the invitation to attend the convention, she readily accepted.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:34.209
But imagine the scene on the first day of the convention when she bumps into her parents during

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:40.129
the intermission. Both were equally surprised to see the other. But Blessed was so excited.

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:45.009
She began interrogating her father with a barrage of questions. And so she started asking him,

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:49.889
well, what are you doing here? Who in mind is you? How did you know about this? Why did you never say

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:55.410
anything? Well, the father could not bear the interrogation anymore and he eventually confessed

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:03.410
your mother and I are Jehovah's Witnesses. We've been inactive since you were born. In fact,

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:08.129
your mother used to serve as a regular pioneer. What is you going to imagine the young woman was

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:14.370
in total disbelief and later admitted just how angry she was at her parents for not raising her

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:20.529
in her siblings in the truth. But this motivated her to progress even more. In four months,

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:25.889
she qualified to become an unbaptized publisher. She ended her relationship with her boyfriend,

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:30.290
even had the courage to terminate her employments since she worked for an organization that was against

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:37.490
Bible principles. She became baptized and the best part is her parents, who were clearly affected by

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:43.170
her example, have since been reactivated. Even one of her siblings who used to make fun of her

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:49.810
for studying the Bible is now an unbaptized publisher. Another aspect of the work that is meeting

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:54.930
with good success is the building of Kingdom Halls. It is very difficult to get construction

00:07:54.930 --> 00:08:01.009
servants into Zimbabwe, so much of the work is done by local brothers. And as you'll note from

00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:08.449
these clips, the work that they have been able to accomplish is tremendous. Currently, a Kingdom Hall

00:08:08.449 --> 00:08:15.009
can be completed in six weeks in the rural areas and two to three months in other locations.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:23.170
And over the past year, 12 Kingdom Halls have been built and another 115 are scheduled across

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:30.290
the country. It was a rainy season in Zimbabwe during the week of the branch visit and it rained

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:35.970
all day every day. And some of the hardest rains were on the day of the special program.

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:44.769
But despite the inclement conditions, 29,411 were in attendance and it was just so touching to see

00:08:44.769 --> 00:08:51.970
so many paying attention and all the smiling joyful faces despite the unfavorable conditions.

00:08:52.929 --> 00:08:56.289
It even moved one news reporter who was there covering the program to ask,

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:03.330
what is it about you people? How is it that this many people would come together to sit in the

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:09.490
rain to listen to some talks about the Bible? Well, the brothers quickly arranged for someone to

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:16.610
follow up on his interest. The visit to these branches was evidence that Jehovah is accomplishing

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:22.289
wonderful things and blessing the work and the diligent efforts of his people. And all along the

00:09:22.289 --> 00:09:27.490
way, the brothers and sisters enthusiastically expressed their love and appreciation for Jehovah

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:31.889
to the governing body and all of the hard work that is being done and accomplished by the

00:09:31.889 --> 00:09:36.529
Beltle families here in the United States as well as in Canada. And it is such a privilege to be

00:09:36.529 --> 00:09:46.769
able to pass on to you their warm love and greetings.
