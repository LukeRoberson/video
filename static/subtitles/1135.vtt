00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.820
To begin, let's illustrate the importance of helping our Bible students to avoid bad

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.419
association, and we'll use the example of a prospector.

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:18.980
When a prospector finds something valuable deep underground, what does he do?

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.260
He must make certain that the weigh-in is secured, and that it's well-supported.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.940
Otherwise, the treasure might be plundered, or the weigh-in could collapse.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.020
This is similar to what we must be aware of when it comes to helping our Bible students.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.179
We work hard to reach the hearts of responsive ones, don't we?

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:45.100
When we do, with Jehovah's help, we continue assisting them to secure and protect their

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.740
hearts.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.740
This includes protecting their growing faith in Jehovah.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:57.579
Otherwise, the devil will ruin what has been done and strip them of their faith.

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:04.099
If we are to help our students to progress, we must keep in mind why avoiding bad associations

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.260
is so important.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.260
We must also have in mind how we can help our students to do this.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.060
Let's first look at why this is so important.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.680
In order for your Bible students to gain Jehovah's friendship, they will likely need to make

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.219
some changes in their choice of association.

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:25.659
Why?

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:32.500
Because your students' progress is greatly affected by his or her choice of friends.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.980
Proverbs 13 and verse 20 explains why this is true.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.260
Please go to that verse.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.579
Proverbs 13-20, it reads,

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:49.099
The one walking with the wise will become wise, but the one who has dealings with the stupid

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:51.900
will fare badly.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.579
Why does a person's choice of associates matter?

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.700
Because we cannot change what the verse says here.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.859
The one who is walking or has dealings with the stupid will fare badly.

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:11.500
The fact is that our friends affect us in either a good way or a bad way, don't they?

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.979
In the Hebrew language, to have dealings with someone can mean to keep company with a

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:21.060
person, that is to be friends with a person.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.699
If a Bible student seeks company with senseless people, he or she will not progress spiritually.

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:32.659
That's why it's so important to help our Bible students to avoid the problems that come

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:35.539
with bad association.

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:41.180
On the other hand, from Proverbs 13-20, we learned that the one walking with the wise

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.900
will become wise.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:50.340
Here, the idea of walking with someone involves choosing to spend time with a person.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.259
So help your Bible students to choose, well, wholesome associates in the truth will help

00:02:56.259 --> 00:03:02.020
your students to break free from worldly thinking and unclean practices.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.340
With this in mind, now that we have considered why we must help them, let's look some more

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.860
at how we can do so.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.900
In the following dramatization, note how need helps her Bible student to seek out and

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.710
select good associates or friends.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.669
Do not be misled, bad associations spoil useful habits.

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:33.169
Okay, but what's good associations?

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:38.370
Well, we have wholesome gatherings with our brothers and sisters from the congregation,

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.689
and we eat and talk, and some like to play musical instruments, and they'll do renditions

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:46.210
of original songs.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:57.879
And we have a really nice time.

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:01.199
Yeah, I don't do that.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:02.879
It's not boring.

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.719
Sure, it's not.

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:06.719
Well, what do you do?

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:31.649
You wouldn't do that.

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:34.529
It's not exactly wholesome.

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:36.129
But you've got to have fun, right?

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:37.129
True.

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:40.329
And we do.

00:04:40.329 --> 00:04:41.649
See for yourself.

00:04:41.649 --> 00:04:44.649
I'm having some people over this weekend.

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:45.769
Why don't you come?

00:04:45.769 --> 00:05:26.819
It wasn't the club, but it was still fun.

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:32.180
Did you take note of how Nita helped her Bible student to seek good friends?

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.300
For one thing, she was empathetic, wasn't she?

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.779
Nita understood that her Bible student would need to see and experience some things for

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:43.980
herself.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:50.379
Also, she invited her student to a gathering of brothers and sisters, and the impact of

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:54.300
that positive experience was obvious.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.779
Likewise, when it comes to how we can help our Bible students, remember to be empathetic

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:01.300
as well.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.379
All of us naturally desire to have friends.

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:08.019
Keep that in mind as you strive to help your students.

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:11.860
It can be difficult for them to seek out good associates.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.779
After all, this is all new for them.

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:21.980
Added to this, as your students accept and apply Bible standards in their lives, some

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.379
of their former friends will likely reject them.

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:31.660
You can prepare them for this by showing them what the Bible says, for example, at 1 Peter

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.100
4, verse 4.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:39.540
In that verse, we are made aware that people would be puzzled over the changes we make in

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.459
order to please Jehovah.

00:06:42.459 --> 00:06:49.459
It also tells us that people might speak abusively of us and reject our changes.

00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:54.620
This could even include members of one's own family, and that fact might be difficult

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.139
for your students to accept.

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:04.620
How can you help your students at a time like that, by giving them a real choice, along

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:11.259
with helping them to draw close to Jehovah, help your students to replace bad associations

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:13.259
with good ones.

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:19.139
Be a friend to your students, introduce them to others in the congregation.

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:25.339
Also, whenever possible, when the study is over, why not stay for a while and talk with

00:07:25.339 --> 00:07:30.220
them, spend some time, and really get to know them.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.699
Call your student whenever he or she is sick.

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:35.740
Show personal interest.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:41.180
Sit with them at the meetings and invite others to sit in on the study with you.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:49.100
And as illustrated in the video, like Nita, include your student in upbuilding social activities.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:55.300
One formerly unbelieving husband who is now an elder recalls how a brother helped him.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:00.420
He said that the brother took a day off from work just to watch a ball game with him,

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:05.100
and he thought to himself, he's normal.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:11.100
It's also important to help your Bible student understand that bad association is not limited

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:14.019
to morally debased people.

00:08:14.019 --> 00:08:21.300
The Bible tells us that the whole world, the whole world, is lying in the power of the

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.019
wicked one.

00:08:23.019 --> 00:08:29.480
So then kindly help your students to see that we must also avoid association with those

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:36.940
who may appear to be morally clean, but who lack faith in the true God Jehovah.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:42.899
In all of these ways, we see why we must help, and how we can help our Bible students

00:08:42.899 --> 00:08:47.620
to avoid bad associations and accept good ones.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:54.860
Remember, we must help them to secure the way into their heart and protect their faith.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:09:01.860
As your students do this by avoiding bad associations, they will no doubt gain many lifelong friends,

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.059
including you.

00:09:04.059 --> 00:09:09.220
And whether your student is a family member, or someone you meet in the ministry, you

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:16.620
will both have precious memories, and joy that will last forever.

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:22.059
Brother Anthony Morris, a member of the governing body, will now consider the next talk of this

00:09:22.059 --> 00:09:28.059
symposium, help your Bible students to overcome unclean habits.
