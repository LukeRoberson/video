00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.360
A good family head is a humble family head.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.360
A good overseer.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.359
A humble overseer.

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:15.359
Now one thing that can affect our humility for good or for bad

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:18.359
is how we view our position.

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.359
Let's explore that using contrasting examples.

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.359
Two men who work very closely together

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.359
but who turned out very differently.

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.359
The first one is King Saul.

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:37.359
We remember Saul as the man who was very humble

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:40.359
and then he wasn't.

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:42.359
What went wrong?

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:47.359
Could it be that the basis for his humility

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:50.359
was a little off-center to begin with?

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:53.359
You remember the day that he first met Samuel

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:56.359
and he was given some unexpected attention?

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:59.359
What was it that Saul said?

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.359
Am I not a Benjaminite of the smallest of the tribes of Israel

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:10.280
and my family the most insignificant of all the families?

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.280
His comments show that he felt that he was in a humble position,

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.280
insignificant family, small tribe, comparison with others.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.280
What would happen if all of that changed?

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.280
It did change and Saul found himself

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.280
as the first member of the first family in Israel.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.560
How would he handle that responsibility?

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.560
Saul evidently felt that what Israel needed

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.560
was a strong leader on the battlefield and off.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.560
And so he developed an authoritarian style.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.560
He did have successes on the battlefield

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.560
and he did command respect.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.560
When he discovered that his young personal musician David

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.560
was also brilliant soldier, everything was going well.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.560
Until that day, you remember the day that he heard

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.560
the women singing David's praises.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.560
Please turn with me to 1 Samuel chapter 18.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.560
And let's look at Saul's reaction.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.560
1 Samuel chapter 18, verse 8, Saul became very angry.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.560
The song displeased him.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.560
He said, they've credited David with tens of thousands.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.560
But to me, they've credited thousands.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.560
The only thing left to give him is the kingship.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.560
It was about the position.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.560
He viewed David as a rival, a threat to his kingship.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.560
Was David a threat to Saul?

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.560
Not at all.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.030
David was completely loyal to his king,

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.030
even off the battlefield.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.030
David was willing to sit humbly with Saul

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.030
and play soothing music for him.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.030
But Saul couldn't shake his suspicious angry thoughts

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.030
and they whirled up inside him until the day

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.469
that he violently threw a spirit David.

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:21.469
To Saul, all he was doing was protecting a position

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:24.469
that was rightfully his.

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:28.719
But how do you think David felt?

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:31.719
Sometime later, David actually said to Saul

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:33.719
1 Samuel 24-14,

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:35.719
who are you chasing?

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:37.719
A dead dog?

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:40.719
A single flea?

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:49.469
Is David felt very small and unappreciated?

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:53.979
How about Saul's own family?

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:57.979
A few pages on to 1 Samuel 20.

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:01.979
This was an occasion when Jonathan

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:05.979
respectfully defended David.

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:07.979
Saul didn't like this.

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:13.979
And so we read here in 1 Samuel 20 and verse 30.

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:16.980
Saul became enraged with Jonathan and said to him,

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.980
Do you think that I do not know that you're choosing to side

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.980
with the Son of Jesse to your own shame

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.980
and to the shame of your mother?

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.980
As long as the Son of Jesse is alive on the earth,

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.980
you and your kingship will not be firmly established.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.980
Again, Saul evidently felt he was just defending

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.980
his position and the position of his son Jonathan.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.980
But how do you think Jonathan felt?

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.980
The account says he left the room angry and humiliated.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.980
And if Saul's dear wife had been there and heard this,

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.980
how do you think she would have felt?

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.480
His Saul's example was extreme.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.480
But the lesson is clear.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.480
As husbands, as overseers,

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.480
we'd never want to become so focused on our position

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:16.480
that we make those under our care feel small or unappreciated.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.860
We're ready for a contrast.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.860
David learned how to treat those under his care from his role model.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.860
Happily, that role model wasn't Saul, it was Jehovah.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.860
And on one occasion, David wrote a special song.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.860
It's recorded twice in the Bible for Samuel 22 and in the 18th Psalm.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.860
The superscription says that David wrote the song when Jehovah

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.860
had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.860
and out of the hand of Saul.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:55.360
Unlike Saul, who made David feel small and unappreciated,

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.360
how did David's real overseer treat him?

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.360
When in Psalm 1835, he said of Jehovah,

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:11.360
your right hand supports me and your humility makes me great.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.360
His Jehovah humbly nurtured David

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.360
and built him up so that he could excel.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:26.360
And David wanted to treat those under his care in exactly the same way.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.360
There were some among David's men

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.360
who were excellent on the battlefield.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.360
Their feet rivaled that of their King David.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.360
How would he treat them?

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.360
Beniah, for example,

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:43.360
killed a lion, slew a giant very much like his King David.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.360
Did David get jealous?

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.360
No, he promoted Beniah.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.360
In fact, he entrusted Beniah with his own life

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.360
because he made him the chief of his bodyguard.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.360
So he encouraged and supported his men

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.360
so that they could excel.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.360
How about his own family?

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.360
Well, remember that by the time that David married Abigail,

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:13.360
he'd already shown that he was willing to listen to her sensible advice.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.360
And his own son Solomon,

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:23.360
David trained him, he supported him, he encouraged him.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:29.360
Even though Solomon had been given the privilege of building the temple,

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:34.360
that was something that David had thought would be his own crowning achievement.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:40.360
His humility allowed them to make those under his care greater.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.360
David was also the one who said,

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.360
Jehovah is my shepherd.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.360
And so he knew how he had to treat those under his care.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.360
Please follow with me as we read in the 78th Psalm,

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.360
something said about David.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:02.769
Psalm 78, it's right near the end of that long Psalm.

00:08:02.769 --> 00:08:05.769
What was it that Jehovah was looking for?

00:08:05.769 --> 00:08:07.769
Verse 70,

00:08:07.769 --> 00:08:10.769
He chose David his servant,

00:08:10.769 --> 00:08:12.769
and took him from the sheep hands,

00:08:12.769 --> 00:08:14.769
from tending the nursing use,

00:08:14.769 --> 00:08:17.769
and made him the shepherd over Jacob, his people,

00:08:17.769 --> 00:08:20.769
and over Israel, his inheritance.

00:08:20.769 --> 00:08:23.769
He shepherded them with integrity of heart,

00:08:23.769 --> 00:08:29.720
and with skillful hands he led them.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.720
Was David successful as a family head,

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.720
and as an overseer of a Jehovah's people?

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:43.350
Yes, he was, because he knew how to be a shepherd.

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:47.350
We know he was successful because much later the prophet Ezekiel,

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.350
talking about the coming Messiah,

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:56.350
said, I will raise up one shepherd over them, my servant David,

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:59.350
truly a market of success.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:03.350
So as family heads, as overseers,

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:07.350
we learn a lot from these contrasting examples.

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:12.350
Unlike Saul, we never want to become so focused on our position

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:15.350
and the respect that we feel is due to us,

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:20.350
that we make others around us feel small and unappreciated.

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:23.350
But like David,

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:27.350
we want to build up, train, encourage,

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:31.350
support those under our care so that they can excel.

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:33.350
We're humble shepherds,

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:36.350
and as such we build not a controlling environment,

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:38.350
but a nurturing one,

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:43.350
so that those under our care can give Jehovah their very best.

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:49.299
When we do that, those under our care will be happy,

00:09:49.299 --> 00:09:54.299
and we'll be happy because we're imitating our humble shepherd

00:09:54.299 --> 00:09:57.299
and overseer of our souls, Jehovah.
