00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:07.860
This is the most important day in this year 2022.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:15.060
Friday, April 15th, is the anniversary of Jesus' sacrificial death.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.859
I'm happy to be able to address the millions of you on this special day,

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:29.239
no matter where you are or what time it is that you can now view this recording.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.039
First, we will ask Brother Clive Martin,

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:37.640
a helper to the writing committee to read our text for the day.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.039
We will always be with the Lord.

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:43.840
First, there's the learnings 417.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.240
Thank you, Brother Martin.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.039
Friends, did you notice that it said,

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:50.439
We?

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:54.439
We will always be with the Lord.

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:57.640
Who does the word we refer to?

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.439
By extension, in a sense, we could say it embraces all faithful servants of Jehovah

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.840
who are gifted everlasting life in the future.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:16.040
However, specifically, those words of Paul apply to the resurrected, anointed ones.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.840
The words were written by the Apostle Paul under inspiration.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.439
All anointed ones look forward to the time when we receive our heavenly reward

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:30.640
and their after will always be with the Lord.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.439
All the millions who are viewing this morning worship program by far,

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:41.840
the vast majority have the hope of enjoying everlasting life as humans here on earth.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.239
So, I thought I would address the bulk of my comments to those of you

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:50.840
who have the marvelous earthly hope.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.640
Let's look back to the time of Adam's creation.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:03.439
Genesis chapter 2 verses 15 through 17 shares some details about the arrangement

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.039
or conditions for Adam's continued existence.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.039
Please follow along as I read it from the screen.

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:17.039
Genesis 2 starting with verse 15 says,

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:21.039
Jehovah God took the man and settled him in the Garden of Eden

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:25.039
to cultivate it and to take care of it.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.840
Jehovah God also gave this command to the man

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.840
from every tree of the Garden you may eat a satisfaction.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.039
But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad,

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:38.039
you must not eat from it,

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:43.840
for in the day you eat from it you will certainly die.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.639
So, Jehovah's original purpose did not include death.

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:56.240
It would only be introduced if perfect Adam chose to disobey the clear command

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.439
about not eating from the specific tree in the Garden and become imperfect.

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:05.240
We understand the cause, don't we?

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.439
A spirit creature was the first to defect.

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:18.039
In Jehovah's wisdom he has never told us the original name of that rebellious spirit creature.

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:23.840
In fact God chose not to reveal even the descriptive name of this enemy

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.439
until some 2500 years after the rebellion in Eden.

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:36.439
In fact only three books of the Hebrew Scriptures even mentioned the name Satan

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:39.439
which means resistor.

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:43.840
We now know him as Satan the Devil.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.639
By clever means and an outright lie,

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:53.240
he tempted Eve into eating from the very tree Jehovah had placed a restriction on.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.840
Eve got Adam to join her in eating of the fruit.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.240
So, what was introduced to all mankind?

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.840
Death.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.439
Death is inevitable in this old system.

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:14.039
When Jehovah first created Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden,

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:20.439
there is no indication to us that the purpose or that he purpose to have some humans

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:25.839
change life forms and dwell in the heavens as spirit creatures.

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:31.639
So, the majority of you viewing this program actually have the prospect

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:36.439
of enjoying the original purpose for all mankind.

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:40.839
Everlasting life as humans on the Paradise Earth.

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:46.920
That is an amazing hope in itself.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:53.720
Of course, after Adam and Eve's sin, Jehovah immediately put into place an arrangement

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.720
to end Satan's abusive reign.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:06.920
This arrangement was outlined in the first prophecy recorded in the Bible at Genesis 3.15.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:13.120
Please follow along on your screen as I read that prophetic verse.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.720
Jehovah said, and I will put enmity between you,

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:24.519
that Satan and the woman, Jehovah's wife-like organization of spirit creatures,

00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:32.720
and between your offspring, which includes the demon angels, and her offspring,

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.519
who ultimately proved to be Jesus Christ.

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:39.519
He will crush your head.

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:47.120
Jesus will deal Satan at death blow, and you will strike him in the heel.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:53.319
Satan would only be able to inflict the minor, temporary wound

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:57.519
when Jesus gave up his human life in sacrificial death,

00:05:57.519 --> 00:06:02.519
and was shortly thereafter resurrected to heavenly life.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.319
Adam's death had no value.

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:08.720
He deserved to die for his sin.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:16.519
On the other hand, Jesus' death had great value because he died in a sinless state

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:22.519
to replace what Adam lost for the entire human family.

00:06:22.519 --> 00:06:28.120
Jehovah God could accept the value of Jesus' perfect life as a ransom

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.319
for obedient descendants of sinful Adam.

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:40.939
And the value of Jesus' sacrifice does not stop at paying for our past sins.

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:45.139
Some 51 verse 5 says,

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:52.740
Look, I was born guilty of error, and my mother conceived me in sin.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:59.339
So, being conceived in sin, we are bound to make more mistakes again.

00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:04.740
However, Jesus' sacrifice makes provision for our future.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:11.139
It will help loyal ones to gain the perfect life Jehovah originally intended

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:15.579
for the offspring of Adam and Eve.

00:07:15.579 --> 00:07:20.779
The watched hour once likened Adam to a father who died and left humans

00:07:20.779 --> 00:07:23.779
in such deep financial debt,

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:30.579
or sin that there is no possible way to get out of debt on one's own.

00:07:30.579 --> 00:07:37.379
In contrast, Jesus was likened to a good father who died and left us

00:07:37.379 --> 00:07:45.579
all a rich inheritance that not only freezes from the enormous debt of Adamic sin

00:07:45.579 --> 00:07:52.379
but also provides enough for us to live on eternally.

00:07:52.379 --> 00:07:56.779
Jesus' death is not simply a cancellation of past sins.

00:07:56.779 --> 00:08:02.579
It is also a wonderful provision for the future.

00:08:02.579 --> 00:08:07.579
Yes, according to John 3, 16,

00:08:07.579 --> 00:08:15.379
Jesus' death is a means of rescuing everyone exercising faith in him from sin,

00:08:15.379 --> 00:08:21.579
disease, old age, imperfection, and death itself.

00:08:21.579 --> 00:08:26.980
And it is that willing, selfless death of Jesus

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:32.860
that we will all remember tonight at the memorial.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.659
Did you notice, Genesis 3, 15 said

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:43.659
there would be enmity between Satan and Jehovah's Heavenly Organization?

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:46.460
During that period of animosity,

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.860
Jehovah progressively revealed the details

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:54.659
to restore his original purpose to the earth.

00:08:54.659 --> 00:09:03.620
Those details included pointing his ancient servants toward the Messiah

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:07.690
who proved to be Jesus.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:11.889
Jesus came to earth as a perfect man and died

00:09:11.889 --> 00:09:18.490
to provide the opportunity for Adam's descendants to gain everlasting life.

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:25.090
Jehovah also unveiled another unexpected detail in the first century.

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:33.090
He made clear he would a 944,000 humans mentioned in Revelation 14

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:39.289
to change life forms and share in the heavenly part of his organization

00:09:39.289 --> 00:09:45.029
actually ruling as kings with Jesus.

00:09:45.029 --> 00:09:48.429
All of this is what we will commemorate this evening

00:09:48.429 --> 00:09:56.230
as we follow the direction Jesus gave his 11 faithful apostles

00:09:56.230 --> 00:10:00.230
so that the glorious hope for both he anointed

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:06.830
and those with earthly hopes does not fade into insignificance.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:12.629
In 2021, we had a record attendance at the memorial

00:10:12.629 --> 00:10:16.830
even though it was by means of video conferencing.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:20.629
We all still have time today to send a text

00:10:20.629 --> 00:10:25.029
or make a phone call to interested ones that we have invited.

00:10:25.029 --> 00:10:28.029
Remind them of this special occasion

00:10:28.029 --> 00:10:35.830
and make sure they know how to go about attending this special meeting locally.

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:41.429
Now we will ask Brother Martin to read the Watchtower comments for us.

00:10:41.429 --> 00:10:44.230
Anointed ones who today finished their earthly course

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:47.629
are instantly raised to life in the heavens.

00:10:47.629 --> 00:10:55.230
This is confirmed by the Apostle Paul's words recorded at 1 Corinthians 15, 51 and 52.

00:10:55.230 --> 00:11:00.830
Upon their resurrection, these brothers of Christ will have complete joy.

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:06.629
The Bible tells us what work those who are changed in the blink of an eye will do in heaven.

00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:08.429
Jesus says to them,

00:11:08.429 --> 00:11:12.230
to the one who conquers and observes my deeds down to the end,

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.830
I will give authority over the nations

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:17.230
and he will shepherd the people with an iron rod

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:21.029
so that they will be broken to pieces like clay vessels

00:11:21.029 --> 00:11:24.029
just as I have received from my Father.

00:11:24.029 --> 00:11:26.629
Thank you, Brother Martin.

00:11:26.629 --> 00:11:30.029
For the last four days our Bible reading has covered

00:11:30.029 --> 00:11:34.629
the Bible accounts leading up to Jesus' sacrificial death.

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:40.029
We invite you to follow along with the reading for today.

00:11:40.029 --> 00:11:44.429
The specific verses will appear on screen in your language.

00:11:44.429 --> 00:11:56.889
Please give contemplative attention to what is described.

00:11:56.889 --> 00:11:59.690
On the first day of the unleavened bread,

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:02.690
the disciples came to Jesus, saying,

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:06.690
Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:08.289
He said,

00:12:08.289 --> 00:12:12.090
Go into the city to sow and sow and say to him,

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:13.690
The teacher says,

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:16.090
My appointed time is near.

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:20.889
I will celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your home.

00:12:20.889 --> 00:12:23.889
So the disciples did as Jesus instructed them

00:12:23.889 --> 00:12:33.330
and prepared for the Passover.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.429
Now on the first day of the unleavened bread

00:12:36.429 --> 00:12:40.730
when they customarily offered up the Passover sacrifice

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:43.529
his disciples said to him,

00:12:43.529 --> 00:12:47.529
Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?

00:12:47.529 --> 00:12:52.730
With that he sent two of his disciples and said to them,

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:58.330
Go into the city and a man carrying an earth and where water jar will meet you.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.730
Follow him and wherever he goes inside,

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:04.129
say to the master of the house,

00:13:04.129 --> 00:13:05.730
The teacher says,

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:10.529
Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?

00:13:10.529 --> 00:13:15.330
And he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.929
Prepare it for us there.

00:13:17.929 --> 00:13:21.730
So the disciples went out and they entered the city

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:24.730
and found it just as he set to them

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:34.570
and they prepared for the Passover.

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:37.269
The day of the unleavened bread now arrived

00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:40.970
on which the Passover sacrifice must be offered.

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:44.970
So Jesus sent Peter and John saying,

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:48.769
Go and get the Passover ready for us to eat.

00:13:48.769 --> 00:13:50.570
They said to him,

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:52.970
Where do you want us to get it ready?

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:54.370
He said to them,

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:57.370
Look, when you enter into the city,

00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:01.370
a man carrying an earth and where water jar will meet you.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:03.970
Follow him into the house that he enters

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:06.570
and say to the landlord of the house,

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:08.769
The teacher says to you,

00:14:08.769 --> 00:14:14.169
Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:18.970
And that man will show you a large furnished upper room.

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:21.169
Get it ready there.

00:14:21.169 --> 00:14:24.769
So they left and found it just as he had told them

00:14:24.769 --> 00:14:34.000
and they prepared for the Passover.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.600
Now because he knew before the festival of the Passover

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.600
that his hour had come for him to leave this world

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.399
and go to the Father,

00:14:42.399 --> 00:14:46.200
Jesus, having loved his own who were in the world,

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.600
loved them to the end.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.000
The evening meal was going on

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.399
and the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot,

00:14:55.399 --> 00:14:58.600
the son of Simon, to betray him.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:03.799
So Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands

00:15:03.799 --> 00:15:08.000
and that he came from God and was going to God,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.200
got up from the evening meal and laid aside his outer garments.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.000
And taking a towel,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.600
he wrapped it around his waist.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.799
After that, he put water into a basin

00:15:20.799 --> 00:15:24.200
and started to wash the feet of the disciples

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:35.159
and to dry them off with the towel that was wrapped around him.

00:15:35.159 --> 00:15:37.960
Do not let your hearts be troubled.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.360
Exercise faith in God.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.559
Exercise faith also in me.

00:15:43.559 --> 00:15:47.559
In the house of my Father are many dwelling places.

00:15:47.559 --> 00:15:50.360
Otherwise, I would have told you

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:54.159
for I am going my way to prepare a place for you.

00:15:54.159 --> 00:15:58.360
Also, if I go my way and prepare a place for you,

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.559
I will come again and will receive you home to myself

00:16:02.559 --> 00:16:08.190
so that where I am, you also may be.

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:11.190
Those were significant passages leading up

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:16.590
to the greatest act of love of all time.

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:20.190
Jehovah and Jesus cooperated together

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:24.190
to undo the horrible results that came from the actions

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:27.789
of Satan, Adam and Eve.

00:16:27.789 --> 00:16:30.590
Whether of the anointed or the other sheep

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:32.590
will look forward to the future

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:35.990
when we will always acknowledge the role

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:38.190
that both Jehovah and Jesus played

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:42.389
in rescuing us from sin and death.

00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:45.990
We pray that all of you will enjoy your evening

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:48.990
during the memorial of Jesus' death.
