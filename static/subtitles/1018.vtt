00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:09.169
Through faith, they defeated kingdoms, brought about righteousness.

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:16.969
Obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the force of fire,

00:00:16.969 --> 00:00:19.969
escaped the edge of the sword.

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:28.969
From a weak state were made powerful, became mighty in war, routed invading armies.

00:00:28.969 --> 00:00:35.969
Faith in Jehovah has allowed ordinary people to do extraordinary things.

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:44.969
This kind of faith is still active today and still has the power to help us through any difficulty.

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:56.969
So let's travel across the globe and see how deep reliance on Jehovah has helped many overcome their unique trials.

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:08.969
As we visit each land, we'll enjoy a story of faith shared both from the perspective of close friends as well as the individuals involved.

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:12.969
Now to our first destination.

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:25.140
South Africa is full of contrasts and diversity.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.140
Big modern cities mix with poorer remote areas.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.140
For many volunteers in Kingdom Hall construction, this presents wonderful opportunities,

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.140
but also unique challenges that require faith in Jehovah.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.140
An example of that is our young friend, Nathla.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:53.140
My wife and I really appreciated the faith she showed to make herself available and to keep her joy in her assignment.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.140
I'm the only Jehovah's Witness in my family.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:10.419
What my mother desired the most for me was to grow up, go to college, and in time, get a high-paying job.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:14.419
My congregation was busy building a Kingdom Hall.

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:18.900
So I would sometimes also go to help.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.900
I wanted to see and feel the joy that those brothers were having building Kingdom Halls.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.900
My mom didn't like it when she heard that I was going to help with Kingdom Hall construction.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.340
She felt that I was wasting my time.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.340
When I arrived on site, everything I did was for the first time.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.340
I didn't have skills and I had never done this work before.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.340
It is not easy.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.340
Sometimes I get tired, mentally exhausted, and even physically exhausted.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.340
Sometimes it's difficult to even read the Bible.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.340
I just want to wash up and go to sleep.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:14.340
It was important for Nathla to find her spiritual balance because her spirituality was more important than working hard on site.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:22.340
I realized that I needed to be really determined because my spirituality was not the same as before.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.340
I saw that I needed to make a change.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:33.340
I made it a priority to read the Bible first and to think about the things I read.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.340
I also made sure that I was regular in going out in the ministry.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:47.189
Prayer helped a lot because prayer is the best way for me to tell Jehovah things that concern me.

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:53.189
I have seen from myself how Jehovah God has sustained me.

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:57.189
We've seen that she is much more balanced.

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:02.189
My mom would phone and ask, Nathla, how is the project going?

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:08.189
And then she would say, if this makes you happy, then I am also happy.

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:18.189
At first, I had my fears, but faith made me confident that Jehovah God would always be there to support me in everything I do.

00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:46.519
Canada is a diverse country, both the landscape and because of immigration, the people and their languages.

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:53.519
In order to share Bible truth with these ones, many brothers are learning a new language, like my friend Shaquille.

00:04:53.519 --> 00:05:01.920
When Shaquille got invited to Bethel, I had the privilege of serving at Canada branch at the time.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:09.920
So it was such a pleasure to see this young man who had all these wonderful goals and to see one by one Jehovah opening those doors to him.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.920
He had made a promise to Jehovah as a young person.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.920
I want to help those that don't have anyone to help them.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:28.920
Jehovah saw good in me and he invested in me and he was very patient with me and I saw it through every brother and sister who sincerely reached out to help me.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:35.920
I'm meditating on Jehovah's qualities and you want to imitate him. You want to show the kindness that he's shown towards you towards others.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.920
So in foreign language, I feel like there's a giant opportunity to do that.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.920
I started to learn Punjabi and I never regretted it, changed my service to Jehovah.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:54.660
There was a time period in my Bethel service when I was really, really sick.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.660
And it was a kind of sickness where I didn't know why it was happening.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:08.660
No doctor could tell me why it was happening. It affected my physical appearance and it seemed like torment throughout each and every day.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.660
A lot of times I would have rather not have been seen.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:23.660
So serving in foreign language now when you're one of the people who spiritually supposed to be strengthening others, but you're going through a hard time yourself, that was a massive challenge for me.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:31.660
I think all of his friends just really appreciated the faith that he had to overcome that.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:37.660
And even though it was a very low point in his life, he really hung on to Jehovah.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:45.660
If I'm in this assignment and I've seen that Jehovah's bless me, what would lead me to conclude that he's going to stop?

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.660
He couldn't sleep, he just couldn't continue at Bethel either.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.660
I had left Bethel, but still my health was decreasing and it was getting really bad.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:00.660
And it was getting to the point that doctors expressed concern about maybe an organ failing and things like that.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:05.660
But they did not give me any way out. I had no way out.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:11.660
He kept making progress even though there was certainly some really difficult times for him.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.660
I had to take a realistic approach towards my new situation.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:23.660
And I had to figure out, okay, how am I going to put Kingdom Interest first while materially taking care of myself?

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:29.660
And hopefully figuring out why I'm sick and if I can do anything about it.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:34.660
In the end, he decided to stick with foreign language.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:42.660
And something I really learned from Shaquille is that he really took the scriptures and made it personal.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:49.660
He would read it as if he was the person in the scriptures and he would meditate on it.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:56.660
And now he could see how, even though he didn't know the answers, Jehovah would help him through his difficult times.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:01.660
So what am I going to do? I'm going to live up to what I promised Jehovah.

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:05.660
Today, he serves with his wife in the Punjabi field.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:10.660
He's a loving shepherd, then he even instructs Punjabi language classes.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:39.240
In Indonesia, people work very hard. They seek stability through a secure job.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:47.240
This can have a powerful influence on the brothers and sisters because they may feel that they can't expand their ministry.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:52.240
When I met the Japanese girls, they were working toward Pioneer Service.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:58.240
When they started, I asked them, would you like to be used more fully by Jehovah?

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.240
I was confused.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:07.240
We felt that the Pioneer Service itself was already a big accomplishment.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:12.240
I encouraged them to think about the school for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:19.240
I had never imagined applying for SKE. It was tempting.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:27.240
I wanted to be used by Jehovah, but what would happen to us after graduation?

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:34.490
Where would we be assigned? What would be our assignment?

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:42.879
We needed more faith, so we prayed a lot about that.

00:09:42.879 --> 00:09:47.879
Jehovah answered my prayers through the brothers and sisters in the congregation.

00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:52.320
Marta had a prestigious job.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:10:00.320
She was even being offered many scholarships so that she could pursue higher education and further advance her career.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:06.320
The brothers and sisters never criticized Marta's work choice.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:11.320
Rather, they showed us the joys of serving Jehovah more fully.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:18.320
When I was still deciding what to do, some of them asked me about my spiritual goals

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:27.320
and what I could see myself doing, thinking about such questions, convinced me to choose SKE.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:31.759
They were invited to attend this school.

00:10:31.759 --> 00:10:38.759
They had to leave their jobs, their house, and the comforts of the place and city where they lived.

00:10:38.759 --> 00:10:41.759
They were assigned to a small congregation.

00:10:41.759 --> 00:10:47.759
They had to pray even more to ask Jehovah God for guidance and direction.

00:10:47.759 --> 00:10:53.759
Now they're serving in the traveling work, caring for a circuit.

00:10:54.759 --> 00:11:02.759
We are fully convinced that it was not due to any greatness on our part, but because of Jehovah's help.

00:11:02.759 --> 00:11:32.830
If we want to be used by Jehovah and if we want to serve him, Jehovah can use us in many different ways.

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:35.830
VG is a beautiful place.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:43.500
However, one thing that is common here is poverty.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:48.500
That is the situation Sister Baccata faces.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:53.000
My husband was a hard worker.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.730
While we were out in the water, he cried out from the mangroves.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:06.730
When I went and found him, I knew that it was a stroke.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:12.730
I had to take on both roles as husband and wife.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.730
I would farm.

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:17.730
I would fish.

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.730
It was a difficult life.

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:28.409
One day, a sister was sick.

00:12:28.409 --> 00:12:32.409
Even though Sister Baccata faced challenges.

00:12:32.409 --> 00:12:37.409
If there was any washing or cleaning needed for the sick sister,

00:12:37.409 --> 00:12:40.409
she was happy to go and help with that too.

00:12:40.409 --> 00:12:52.519
I think back to when a cyclone hit Kadavu, cyclone Kenny.

00:12:52.519 --> 00:12:56.519
I was scared by the damage it did to our house.

00:12:56.519 --> 00:13:00.519
Our outdoor kitchen was blown off.

00:13:00.519 --> 00:13:07.519
When I heard about the things that happened to the brothers, I felt so sorry for them.

00:13:07.519 --> 00:13:13.830
Their roofs were blown away and the walls had fallen down.

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:21.809
Just think about what Sister Baccata did.

00:13:21.809 --> 00:13:26.120
She had twenty Fiji and dollars.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.120
That is the only money she had.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:35.519
But she decided to give all of that to the brothers.

00:13:35.519 --> 00:13:43.370
I didn't have any other way to help them.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:46.370
Jehovah is the God of love.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:51.370
Like it says at first on four and eight, his main quality is love.

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:56.370
Because of that love, I gave the money from the bottom of my heart.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:14:06.509
I learned that even though we are poor, we can still be generous to assist our brothers.

00:14:06.509 --> 00:14:14.690
The more I gave, the more Jehovah gave back to me.

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:20.690
Till today, we've always had what we've needed.

00:14:42.679 --> 00:14:46.679
And through, like many places around the world,

00:14:46.679 --> 00:14:54.899
our brothers and sisters need to work hard.

00:14:54.899 --> 00:15:00.899
Benjamin and Doris have to make good use of their resources in order to provide for their family.

00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:06.750
We want to give our children a spiritual heritage.

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:13.220
We want them to be able to serve Jehovah by watching how we are doing it.

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:16.220
We watch a lot of videos that help us.

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:20.220
We often remember the video about Abilio Anula.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:22.220
They also had three children.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:27.220
They moved to another place and grew up in a very nice spiritual atmosphere.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:31.820
They are serving Jehovah now as adults.

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:35.820
So we asked ourselves, could we move to another place where the need is great?

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:42.200
It takes faith to go to an unfamiliar place.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:48.200
One video on JW.org that helped us a lot was about the family from England that moved to Ecuador.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.200
First, they went for one month.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:54.200
So we said that we should also go visit first.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.200
Going to another country would have been exciting.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.200
It would have been super.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:04.200
But our economic situation wouldn't allow us to go that far.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:11.200
We took a trip together with our children to visit a territory that had a need, called Kalango.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.200
It takes about an hour and a half to get there.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:18.200
They liked the geography of the area, in all the vegetation.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.200
There were many things that captured their attention.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:26.200
The things that I like in Kalango are playing and preaching.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:36.980
We were unable to move to the city of Kalango because of the economic situation that the people face there.

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:38.980
It's hard to get a job there.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:45.980
So for that reason, we decided to travel to Kalango Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.980
And work the other days here in Pachakamak.

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:55.980
We have felt that Jehovah is helping us because he has made it possible to work here.

00:16:55.980 --> 00:17:02.980
And the money that we earn in those days allows us to be with our brothers there.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:06.980
We needed to know how to keep things simple.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:10.980
We learned that from the videos on JW.org.

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:15.980
The hard work that they do proves to me that they really love Jehovah.

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:18.980
They fully trust that Jehovah is our father.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:23.980
He is the dad and we know that dad always comes through for his children.

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:27.980
And that faith is something that greatly motivates them.

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:31.980
The videos on JW.org have given us the push that we needed.

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:39.230
We needed those videos in order to take action and move to another area.

00:17:39.230 --> 00:18:04.640
Across Russia, our brothers have successfully faced decades of persecution and ban.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:13.640
The budden chucks, like so many families there, still face these challenges today.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:22.640
On June 12, 2018 at 5.30am, armed men burst into our home.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:29.079
They threw my husband to the floor and handcuffed him.

00:18:29.079 --> 00:18:35.079
Eventually, they sent my husband to a pretrial detention facility for 11 months.

00:18:35.079 --> 00:18:39.079
It was frightening just imagining certain things.

00:18:39.079 --> 00:18:43.079
She didn't find it easy and shed many tears.

00:18:43.079 --> 00:18:47.079
I was really worried about how I would care for the children

00:18:47.079 --> 00:18:52.079
and how I would fulfill their needs spiritually, emotionally and physically.

00:18:52.079 --> 00:19:00.519
Prayer calmed me down because I wanted, of course, to react very emotionally to everything

00:19:00.519 --> 00:19:04.519
to the injustice that we were facing.

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:09.519
When the court hearings were going on, brothers and sisters would come.

00:19:09.519 --> 00:19:13.519
It was such a support, so strengthening.

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:24.420
On September 19, 2019, the court convicted my husband

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:32.559
and sent him to a prison colony for three and a half years.

00:19:32.559 --> 00:19:38.559
In January 2020, a new disaster hit us.

00:19:38.559 --> 00:19:43.559
At 1am, our house burned to the ground.

00:19:43.559 --> 00:19:51.559
We stood there near the house, and my son Igor suggested saying a prayer.

00:19:51.559 --> 00:19:56.559
I don't remember the prayer, but afterwards I felt calmer.

00:19:56.559 --> 00:19:59.559
Then cars started coming to the house.

00:19:59.559 --> 00:20:01.559
It was our brothers and sisters.

00:20:01.559 --> 00:20:04.559
I was frozen, shaking from the cold.

00:20:04.559 --> 00:20:08.559
They dressed me like a small child.

00:20:08.559 --> 00:20:13.559
They brought us hot tea, food, everything of the highest quality.

00:20:13.559 --> 00:20:31.660
Just one month after the fire, when they took my husband to the prison colony,

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.660
officers there beat him up.

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:43.099
When I found out about it, it was so hard for me.

00:20:43.099 --> 00:20:51.650
Because I didn't know how to help my husband or how he was feeling.

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:55.650
Tanya copes with hardships very courageously.

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:58.650
I prayed to Jehovah sometimes all night.

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:05.650
It felt as though Jehovah gave me painkillers to dull my pain.

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:08.650
My husband, Alexi, tries to take care of us.

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:11.650
In the pre-trial detention facility, for example,

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:16.650
each day he wrote letters of encouragement to us, which we read together as a family.

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:21.650
My dear family, remember the qualities that we need right now,

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:27.650
endurance, courage, calmness, and most importantly, faith.

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:31.650
I like the thought that after winter, summer always comes.

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:35.650
After the night, the day arrives, and after the darkest days,

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:39.650
there will definitely come a sunny one.

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:46.650
Throughout all these trials, having a good spiritual schedule and reading the Bible has given me strength.

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:51.650
Also, we prepare for meetings and participate in the ministry.

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:54.650
I was really afraid to do it.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:59.650
But this situation has helped me to see Jehovah's support.

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:05.650
I have realized that even in my circumstances, I can still help others.

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:09.650
We know that Jehovah has already given us his support,

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:13.650
and we believe that he will continue to support us.

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:18.650
Their example of courage instead fast faith in the face of difficulties and trials

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:21.650
proves that we can also remain faithful.

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:26.650
We too can make Jehovah happy and continue to serve him without becoming discouraged.

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:33.650
We have learned to trust more in Jehovah and not to panic when a difficult situation arises.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:39.650
His difficulties have made me stronger, helped me to overcome many of the fears I used to have,

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:50.150
and strengthened my faith and my desire to help others.

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:57.150
As we have seen, our brothers, the world, over continue to show strong faith.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:12.650
How did they do it? A regular study of God's Word, time spent in deep meditation,

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:16.650
and seeking His direction in prayer.

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:20.650
What did this allow them to accomplish?

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:25.650
Through faith, our brothers handled theocratic building assignments,

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:30.650
learned foreign languages, attended theocratic schools.

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:36.650
Though poor, remained generous, served where the need was great,

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:40.650
and preached despite persecution.

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:44.650
And Jehovah knows we can do the same.

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:52.650
Yes, if we let faith move us to action, those actions will strengthen our faith.
