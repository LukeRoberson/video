00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:07.259
None of us like being told lies, but we are constantly bombarded with false stories.

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.660
If we are not careful, they could harm us.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.940
Today we are going, therefore, to develop the theme, protect yourself from lies.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.820
We will answer three questions.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.019
What lies must be protect ourselves from?

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:24.300
Why are those lies dangerous?

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.500
And how can we protect ourselves from lies?

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.179
Let us start with the first question.

00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:33.780
What lies must be protect ourselves from?

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.060
The lies we want to talk about today are often called false news, fake news,

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.939
misinformation or false information.

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:46.979
Today we are experiencing an avalanche of misinformation.

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:53.380
For example, there is so much misinformation out there about the COVID-19 pandemic.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.700
But these lies deal with the origin of the virus,

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.299
unproven prevention and cures.

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:05.219
They include responses by governments, companies, celebrities and others.

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:10.900
Now common to misinformation is their sensational nature.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.859
They are created to be widely shared in order to generate revenue,

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:19.939
or they are promoting or discrediting a public figure,

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.019
a political movement, the company, et cetera.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.340
Now, we often find those false or fake news in social media.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.819
But we also find them in the established news media.

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:37.579
In many countries, people know exactly what newspaper or TV station

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.219
distorts the truth in the one or in the other direction.

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:49.459
And yet, misinformation of this kind has been in existence throughout history.

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:54.340
Let's look at one example that we find in 2nd Kings chapter 18.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.780
At one point, King Hezekiah was confronted with propaganda by Assyrian messengers.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.819
What were the elements of their misinformation?

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:11.620
Let's look at the first element that we find in 2nd Kings 18, verse 21.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.860
Here we find an outright lie.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.939
We read.

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:20.780
Look, you trust in the support of this crushed read Egypt,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.699
which ever man should lean on it would enter into his palm and pierce it.

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:26.979
This was a lie.

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:31.740
For Hezekiah had not made an alliance with Egypt.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.060
Now, let's look at element number 2.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.460
We find it in verse 22 and 25.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.699
After stating that Hezekiah had removed Jehovah's High Places and Altars in verse 22,

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:47.699
this is what we read in verse 25.

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:53.900
Now is it without authorization from Jehovah that I have come against this place to destroy it?

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.500
Jehovah himself said to me, go up against this land and destroy it.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.419
So element number 2 is cunning reasoning.

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:09.500
We find bits of truthful information that were suddenly diffused with lies.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.900
The message was, Jehovah would not act in behalf of his people because he was displeased with them.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.259
Yet the opposite was true.

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:24.780
Jehovah was very happy with his people because they had returned to true worship.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.259
Now what is element number 3?

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:28.500
We find it in verse 31.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:35.500
Here we see lies that are presented in a way of an easy solution with tempting rewards.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.500
Let's be read in verse 31, in the middle, starting there,

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.500
make peace with me and surrender.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:53.500
And each one of you will eat from his own vine and from his own victory and will drink the water of his own sister.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.500
Surrender was presented as an easy solution in connection with empty rewards.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:07.500
The prospect of eating fresh bread and drinking new wine must have been tempting to those in lockdown.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:14.500
However, did the Assyrians ever treat their enemies kindly?

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.449
No, never.

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.449
That brings us to our second question.

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.449
Why are those lies dangerous?

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:30.449
Well, in Hisakaya's day, the propaganda was supposed to lead the Jews in making a bad decision.

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:34.449
A decision that could have caused their lives today.

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:41.449
To making a bad decision would be the result of trusting in false or fake news.

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:42.449
This is dangerous.

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:49.449
In this time of the pandemic, this can have an effect on our health and our life.

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:57.449
We can react to other propaganda that can create the financial losses or can result in other negative consequences.

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.759
But there is even more at stake.

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:05.759
Lies destroy trust.

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:12.759
They create doubts and they can undermine our life-saving determination to follow Jehovah's direction.

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:19.759
For example, we are determined to respect governments and their laws in harmony with Romans 13.

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:26.759
Now, the news often presents politics, politicians, state institutions in a bad light.

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:35.759
Sometimes we are confronted with outright lies, with cunning reasoning, or easy solutions with empty promises.

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:38.759
Please, let's be on the watch.

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:50.759
This can weaken our determination to be faithful to Jehovah by obeying the superior authorities and displaying Christian neutrality.

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:52.759
Another example.

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:57.759
Misinformation about Jehovah's organization and the governing body.

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:07.759
Jehovah's witnesses have been accused of promoting communism, while others claim that we promote the ideals and interests of American imperialism.

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:16.759
Our brothers and sisters have been called anarchists, and nowadays we are being called extremists, and the list can go on.

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:19.759
What will be the next lie?

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:25.759
Remember, lies create doubts and destroy trust.

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:31.759
Some of what we can hear and read is based on misinformation campaigns of apostates.

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:35.759
It may sound convincing, even to us.

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:41.759
Even if we now say, I will not believe it anyway, I'm just curious to know what it is.

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:50.759
Exposing ourselves to this kind of misinformation can create doubts and undermine our complete trust in the governing body.

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:58.759
This makes us vulnerable. Jehovah will use his organization to lead us through the great repulation.

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:02.759
There is just no other way to succeed.

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:08.759
That brings us to our third question, how can we protect ourselves from those lies?

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:14.759
Now, we can protect ourselves from those lies by limiting our exposure to misinformation.

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:24.759
Therefore, we need to look at the quality and the quantity of the information we take in, the quality.

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:31.759
We want to pick the most reliable source of information, quantity.

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:36.759
To stay up to date with world events, we do not need to update us every hour.

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:42.759
Therefore, let us set a personal time limit and then stick to it.

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:44.759
What else can we do?

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:54.759
Proverbs 14 verse 15 says, the naive person believes every word, but the shrewd one ponders each step.

00:07:54.759 --> 00:08:00.759
So the key is to have a healthy skepticism while keeping an open mind.

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:11.759
Or we read in Job 12 verse 11, does not the ear test out words as the tongue tastes food?

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:16.759
So before reacting quickly on something we hear or read, we want to test out words.

00:08:16.759 --> 00:08:19.759
Let us look for solid confirmation.

00:08:19.759 --> 00:08:23.759
We want to compare what we read in the Bible and what we learn from the Bible.

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:29.759
What Bible principles apply? Is there any guidance from the organization?

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:37.759
And when it comes to news about Jehovah's organization, we can expect more lies to be spread as we get closer to Jehovah's Day.

00:08:37.759 --> 00:08:42.759
Let us therefore strengthen our trust today.

00:08:42.759 --> 00:08:52.759
The good guidance from Jehovah's organization during this pandemic is just another proof that Jehovah is with the governing body.

00:08:52.759 --> 00:08:56.759
So our theme was, protect yourself from lies.

00:08:56.759 --> 00:09:04.759
We discussed the danger of misinformation in its different forms, outright lies, cunning reasoning and empty promises.

00:09:04.759 --> 00:09:08.759
Lies destroy trust.

00:09:08.759 --> 00:09:15.759
Therefore, let us limit our exposure to these lies and strengthen our trust in Jehovah in this organization today.

00:09:15.759 --> 00:09:22.759
This will prepare us for one of the greatest lies in the very near future.

00:09:22.759 --> 00:09:24.759
Peace and security.

00:09:24.759 --> 00:09:31.759
And remember, this will be fake news and many, most people will believe in it.
