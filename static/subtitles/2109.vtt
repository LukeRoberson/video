00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.719
In my research, I have followed Jehovah's Witnesses for many years now.

00:00:05.719 --> 00:00:12.720
I have visited Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia, in the US, in England, in Copenhagen, in Denmark.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.720
I have interviewed a number of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.719
And Jehovah's Witnesses are characterized by being a minority religion,

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:27.719
but also a minority religion which lives peacefully together with the majority in societies.

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:35.719
They go to public schools, they go to ordinary workplaces, they're not segregated, they are adjusted to society.

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:47.719
The law on extremism is quite vague, especially that it's made in order to prevent the incitement of violence and hatred on racial and religious grounds.

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:53.719
But it doesn't say which kinds of actions are extremists.

00:00:53.719 --> 00:01:02.719
Jehovah's Witnesses is a Christian organization and Christianity as such is characterized by being exclusivist.

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.719
And that means that Christian organizations claim that they have the absolute truth.

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:16.719
If the Jehovah's Witnesses then are extremists, then most orthodox, catholic, Protestant version of Christianity could claim the same thing.

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:26.719
The Jehovah's Witnesses are known for their resistance against violence, especially for their objection against serving in the military and carry weapons.

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:33.719
And thus a law which is accusing the Jehovah's Witnesses of inciting violence is kind of ironic.

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:43.719
State legislation on religious movement is often problematic, especially when we're talking about the mindset of a religious movement.

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:56.719
Because such laws has a tendency to aim at particular movements with a mindset and not others with a mindset which is quite comparable.
