00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:44.469
In behalf of the Ecuador Branch Committee and the entire Bethel family, it is a pleasure

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.350
to say to you, welcome to equity.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.750
We invite you to enjoy the following video presentation.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.310
In it, you will see how the work started here in the country.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:04.530
At the same time, you will see that the fill here in this country remains white for

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.280
harvest being.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.519
It has been said that every portrait that has been painted with filling is a portrait

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:15.920
of the artist.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.359
In Ecuador, one of the most biologically diverse countries on the planet, Jehovah has revealed

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:32.560
his love, power, generosity, imagination and sense of humor by means of the things he created.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.799
The people of Ecuador are just as diverse as the country they live in.

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:45.519
One thing that many have in common is a deep spirituality and a desire to know Jehovah.

00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:49.359
This has helped many to embrace Bible truth.

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:52.840
How did the work begin here in Ecuador?

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.519
In 1946, the first missionaries arrived, Walter and Wilmeda Pemberton and Thomas and

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:01.920
Mary Klingesmith.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.520
Since there were no possible roads to Kito, they had to travel to their assignment by train,

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.439
a dozen more missionaries arrived in 1948.

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:20.599
In March of 1949, Nathan Norr and Milton Henshel visited Ecuador for the first time.

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:27.439
In Kito, 82 people listened while brother Norr gave his talk by candlelight.

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:32.840
Later, 280 attended the same program in Wayakil.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.800
More missionaries arrived during the 50s.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.240
One of them was Francis Kerr, now Woodburne.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:49.280
I arrived in Ecuador on September 1st, 1950.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.159
There were around 100 publishers when I arrived and there are now more than 80,000.

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:01.680
You can see how Jehovah makes it grow and it gives me tremendous joy to say that I had

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.680
a part in it.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.280
I feel that my life has been very full and even though I am now a widow, I know that

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.560
I have the association of brothers everywhere and they always take care of me.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.729
I never feel abandoned.

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:28.129
From 1947 to 1980, the number of publishers in Ecuador grew from 24 to more than 5,000.

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:34.009
During the next 20 years, that number skyrocketed to more than 40,000.

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:43.169
In 2014, a new peak was reached of more than 85,000 Kingdom Proclamers in Ecuador.

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:51.330
In 2015, we had the special privilege of hosting an international convention here in Kito, Ecuador.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.800
We welcomed 3,000 delegates from all around the world.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.479
When we saw the international conventions were available, a group got together and said,

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:04.479
we want to go to Ecuador.

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:11.479
This is an event that the majority of Ecuadorians have never seen.

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:13.919
The challenge is, how do we do it?

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:19.560
Thanks to Jehovah's spirit and his direction, we have been able to move forward.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:28.319
So, occasions like this lift the brothers' spirits and show that this is not a human organization.

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:34.560
They show that Jehovah is supporting these things and that there couldn't be anything

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.319
this well done by means of mere humans.

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:46.480
Our problems become so small when we see the worldwide organization and it makes us feel

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.319
a stronger desire to serve Jehovah.

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:54.360
You know, Jehovah's people were a worldwide brotherhood, but you feel it when you're

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.639
here at the convention, you know, where you see the brothers and sisters and all that

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:03.360
are coming up to you and they're hugging you and you're hugging back.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:10.870
It's the best way to live their real life.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.629
We hope that you have enjoyed this video.

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:18.990
As you have seen, Christian Association promotes a wonderful spirit.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:27.389
It produces happiness, generosity, thankfulness and above all, it honors Jehovah.

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:34.189
The remain faithful, continue to sell us in your service and if not before, we will see

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:39.550
you again very soon in the new world that Jehovah has prepared for all of us.
