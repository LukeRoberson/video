WEBVTT

00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.219
We love Jehovah's name and all that it stands for

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.780
When you look down at the comments for this morning

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.699
Go right down to the end to the last two sentences

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.940
The name Jehovah really is or inspiring

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.820
It includes all that our father is all that he has done and all that he will do

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.780
This paragraph is taken from an article with a theme

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.820
Unify my heart to fear your name

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.539
So how is Jehovah's name connected with reverential or and

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.340
godly fear

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.219
Let's explore that with the help of King David and the Apostle Paul

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:48.259
We begin in Psalm 19

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:57.460
David was a keen students of Jehovah's creation and he reported in Psalm 19 verse 1 what he'd seen

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:01.100
So do you have Psalm 19 verse 1?

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.780
The heavens are declaring the glory of God

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.780
The skies above proclaimed the work of his hands

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.739
David had been observing the sun by day and the moon and the stars by night

00:01:16.019 --> 00:01:22.099
But he knew he was seeing more what he saw was the glory of God

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.459
The work of his hands

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:32.459
Now when David looked on a dark night at the sky

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:35.459
He may have seen something like this

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.659
He was enthralled by the beauty and the order of it all

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:46.719
With the help of modern technology

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:57.560
We see much more than David ever did and we were also aware that what we see is but a tiny fraction of all that Jehovah has made

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:06.060
When you think of what our creator has caused to become

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:08.580
How does it make you feel?

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:16.460
That is the sense of a reverential or and that's what David felt a

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.099
David took it one step further

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:25.300
He reasoned that the one who gave the laws that govern the sun moon and stars

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.060
Also gave laws to govern us

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:31.419
And how did he feel about those laws?

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:34.419
Look at verses seven and eight

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:39.620
Says the law of Jehovah is perfect restoring strength

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.900
The reminder of Jehovah's trust worthy making the inexperienced one wise

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.740
The orders from Jehovah are righteous causing the heart to rejoice

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:54.180
The commandment of Jehovah is clean making the eyes shine

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.020
See to David

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.620
Jehovah's laws were not simply our obligation to keep

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:07.819
They were part of Jehovah's handiwork. So what does the law giver Jehovah

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:11.379
Causes his obedient servants to become

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.659
Just look at his words again. He causes them to become people who are strong

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:21.659
wise

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.500
joyful

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.300
And with a clear spiritual vision

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.620
Now it is true the sun moon and stars have no choice but to obey God's laws

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.819
We do have a choice

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:45.259
But rarely would you ever want to do anything that would displease or disappoint your law giver

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:49.419
Never we really do want to please him and everything we do

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.979
So that takes us to our motive and there it is in verse nine

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:57.419
The fear of Jehovah is pure

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.060
lasting forever

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.419
So following David's train of thought we've gone from Jehovah's name and his handiwork

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.379
to reverential or

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:11.419
godly fear

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:14.620
And our role in the arrangement willing obedience

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.019
Let's take another example. This is one from Hebrews chapter 12

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:25.100
The Apostle Paul had been describing

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:29.339
To anointed Christians their place in Jehovah's arrangement

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.779
And here in Hebrews chapter 12 verses

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.500
22 and 23

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.220
He paints a picture

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.220
says to these anointed Christians

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.540
You have approached a Mount Zion

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:46.939
And the city of the living God heaven leads Jerusalem

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:50.699
And millions of angels in general assembly

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:56.300
And the congregation of the firstborn who've been enrolled in the heavens and God the judge of all

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:59.259
What an amazing scene

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:05.980
Do you have a clear picture in your mind of Jehovah's beautiful heavenly arrangement

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.699
Centres on the kingdom which is going to have such benefits for us on the earth

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.139
So what does our sovereign Jehovah cause to become

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.139
What does he cause his faithful servants

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.220
Jesus the 144,000 to become

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:38.279
When you meditate on that does it not in gender and you a sense of awe at everything that is associated with Jehovah's name and purpose

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:43.319
Meditate on it now you're ready to ask the next question

00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:45.560
So what is

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.639
My role our role in this arrangement

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:52.680
Paul evidently anticipated the question

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:59.399
Because he goes on to talk about how all opposing kingdoms are going to be shaken out of existence

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.759
And then in verse 28 he says

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:05.079
therefore

00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:09.079
Seeing that we are to receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.480
For the anointed

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:16.199
They receive a kingdom by participating as rulers in that arrangement

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.600
For us with the earthly hope

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.319
We're going to be loyal subjects

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:26.360
Seeing that we are to receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:31.000
Let us continue to receive undeserved kindness

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:38.839
Through which we may acceptably offer God sacred service with godly fear and awe

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.040
Our role sacred service

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:45.639
pure worship

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:48.439
So what's our takeaway point

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.600
When we meditate on Jehovah's handiwork

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.720
Whether it's his physical creation

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.920
Or it's an aspect of his marvelous spiritual purpose

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.660
always

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.899
Look for the signature

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.620
What has Jehovah caused to become

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:14.899
What does he cause

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.019
His loyal servants to become this is Jehovah the creator

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.980
Jehovah the Lord give her Jehovah our father our sovereign our judge

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.860
What does he cause to become

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:33.220
Think about it meditate because this is going to bring to our hearts this beautiful

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.259
Revidential sense of awe for everything associated with Jehovah's name

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.180
And then we'll be ready to ask the next question

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:47.860
What role has Jehovah given me in this arrangement

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.160
That is where our godly fear

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.319
Motivates us to do what ever it is that Jehovah wants us to do

00:07:57.959 --> 00:08:00.920
In sacred service and supporting his arrangement

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.540
Coming back to where we began

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.540
We do this because

00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:11.540
We love Jehovah's name and all that it stands for

00:08:11.939 --> 00:08:18.740
What an honor it is that we can render Jehovah sacred service with godly fear and awe
