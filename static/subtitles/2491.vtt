00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:07.370
that the governing body will continue to do everything in our power to provide the needed

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:14.849
relief aid to our dear brothers in these affected areas. We love you very much and thank

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.089
you for tuning in for this update.

00:00:17.089 --> 00:01:01.299
I wish we could help. Me too. Oh, I have an idea. What is that, sweetie? Can I give this

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:06.439
to our brothers affected by the hurricane? Of course you can. We'll put it in the contribution

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:19.250
box on Sunday. I guess I can't help. There are many things you can do to help. First,

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:28.239
you can save some money for next time. Second, you can think about them and pray for them.

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:34.239
You know, Jesus felt the same way when He was here on earth. Do you remember what He said

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:41.760
when He helped the leper? I want to. Yes, He did what He could to help others. Just like

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.439
you. That makes us very proud of you.
