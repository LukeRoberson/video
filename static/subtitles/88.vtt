00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:07.169
Welcome to the January 2022 edition of JW Broadcasting.

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:37.079
The 137th annual meeting of the Watchtower Bible and Track Society of Pennsylvania was held on October 2, 2021.

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:45.079
How joyful it was to be together in person in the Warwick Auditorium for this event.

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:54.079
The Bethel family members in attendance enjoyed a wonderful lineup of spiritual talks, exciting updates and videos.

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:02.079
Now, we're delighted to be able to share the entire program with you here on JW Broadcasting.

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:11.079
The governing body assigned me to be the chairman for the annual meeting and to anchor the January and February JW Broadcasts.

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:18.079
This month, we'll see the first part of the program and part two will be featured in next month's broadcast.

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:25.079
So, please enjoy the first half of the 2021 annual meeting.

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:29.650
Do you know what time it is?

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.650
Most of us are conscious of time every day.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.650
We have a time to go to work, a time to go to school, a time to eat,

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:46.650
a time for our Christian meetings, and even a time for association with our dear friends.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:57.650
As the great time keeper, Jehovah reminds us at Ecclesiastes chapter 3 and verse 1 that there is a proper time for everything.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.650
And thus it's not surprising that the Bible speaks of the right time for various events.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:16.650
For example, at Leviticus chapter 26 and verse 4, Jehovah promised the obedient Israelites that he would bless them with showers of rain at the proper time.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:24.650
Well, that's just a detail probably for most of us, but if you've ever lived in a farming community or you've done farming yourself,

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:37.650
you know that rain at the right time can give you a bumper crop, but rain at the wrong time can completely destroy that same crop.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.650
Even words can be spoken at the right time.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:49.650
Proverbs 15 verse 23 says, a word spoken at the right time how good it is.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.650
Truly, it is a fundamental principle that timing is everything.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.650
Well, think for a moment about prophesied events that took place right on time.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:10.650
Jesus was baptized at precisely the time when the Messiah was prophesied to appear.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.650
The kingdom began its heavenly rule right on time in 1914.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:31.650
And looking to the future, Jesus said that Jehovah has set the time even the exact day and the hour for the end of this wicked system of things.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:40.930
Does the governing body know when Armageddon is going to come? Yes, we do.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.930
It's going to come right on time.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:55.930
We have full confidence in that, don't we? That Jehovah is going to bring about those earth-shaking events exactly on time.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.930
But there's something else that Jehovah has promised to provide at the proper time.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:13.740
Would you go in your Bibles? Let's look at Matthew chapter 24 and verse 45.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:29.740
Now here, Jesus posed this question, who really is the faithful and discreet slave whom his master appointed over his domestics to give them their food at the proper time?

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:41.740
Happy is that slave if his master on coming finds him doing so. Truly, I say to you, he will appoint him over all his belongings.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:54.740
Well, what did Jesus say here? He said he would appoint a faithful and discreet slave who would provide the spiritual food, but there's another important detail there. Did you notice it?

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.740
He added at the proper time.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:12.740
Well, because of Jehovah's perfect sense of time, he knows exactly what his people need and he knows exactly the right time to provide it.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.740
Now, just consider a couple of examples of this.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:30.740
Just as World War II was erupting, the November 1, 1939 issue of the watch tower featured an in-depth discussion of the topic of neutrality.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.740
That timing was absolutely perfect.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:47.740
Because of those articles, our brothers worldwide knew exactly what to do as the war engulfed the entire planet.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:06:01.740
Well, after the war, as the organization was rapidly growing, Jehovah's organization arranged large international conventions that were held in New York City.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:13.300
In 1958, a quarter of a million people, can you imagine, overflowed Yankee Stadium and the polo grounds. Were any of you there?

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:26.980
Well, it's so wonderful. We still have a few people there. It's not that I wasn't in the truth at that time. It's just I wasn't in the world at that time.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:40.980
Well, that amazing convention came just on time. It energized God's people and we could say it put Jehovah's witnesses on the map.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:47.980
It was hard to ignore a convention of a quarter of a million people.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:07:00.980
Well, fast forward to 2020 and a time when the world was engulfed in a global pandemic. Large gatherings were prohibited in most countries.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:09.980
Could we go to Yankee Stadium and have 250,000 people? No, but right on time.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:24.980
Jehovah guided the faithful and discreet slave so that our worldwide brotherhood could enjoy the convention program from home, truly spiritual food at the proper time.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:36.980
And during the pandemic, we've had to change our methods, haven't we? We've had to receive direction about how to carry out our preaching work and how to carry out our congregation meetings.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:47.980
But throughout this period, we have received powerful, powerful evidence that Jehovah has given this direction to us at the proper time.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:08:16.980
Now, let me just give you a couple of examples. During the 2021 service year, at least 22 branches have reported an all-time peak in the number of publishers. Can you imagine during the pandemic? For example, the Korea branch has reported a new peak in publishers every month.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:43.100
During the 2021 service year, isn't that amazing during a pandemic? And with so many wonderful things happening in the field, I'm sure that you're all wondering about our worldwide memorial attendance for 2021.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:58.100
Well, by the undeserved kindness of our amazing God, Jehovah, we have reached an all-time peak crossing the 21 million mark.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:10.970
Would you like to know the exact figure? Well, keep on the watch. It'll be announced today at the proper time.

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:33.299
Well, today in our program, we are going to have a wonderful buffet of rich spiritual food of many varieties and types. And by the end of the program, I'm sure that you'll agree that it was just what we needed at this moment in time.

00:09:34.299 --> 00:09:55.299
Well, last year at the 2020 annual meeting, the governing body was excited to release a new publication to study with interested ones entitled Enjoy Life Forever, An Interactive Bible Course. It introduced a new and innovative way to study the Bible with interested ones.

00:09:56.299 --> 00:10:09.299
How has the publication been received by Jehovah's people? And maybe more to the point, how is this new format touching the hearts of those studying the Bible with us? Please enjoy this video.

00:10:11.299 --> 00:10:28.769
How thrilled we were at last year's annual meeting to receive a new publication. Enjoy Life Forever, an interactive Bible Course.

00:10:28.769 --> 00:10:43.769
Already, many publishers are having success in conducting progressive studies using this new tool. As you listen to experiences from around the world, note the evidence of Jehovah's blessing.

00:10:43.769 --> 00:10:49.769
When they made the announcement of the new publication, for me, it was just pure excitement.

00:10:49.769 --> 00:10:59.769
Actually, I was so overjoyed that I kept going to the website around the time of the release and at times I would even refresh my browser a few times a day to see when it was out.

00:10:59.769 --> 00:11:04.769
Having all the teaching methods right in our hands, what more can we ask for?

00:11:04.769 --> 00:11:12.769
We're so excited that during this pandemic, Jehovah has given us something to energize our ministry.

00:11:13.769 --> 00:11:20.769
When you heard that we would be using a new method for conducting studies, were you a bit hesitant?

00:11:20.769 --> 00:11:27.769
A close attention to what experienced teachers are saying about the benefits of this approach.

00:11:27.769 --> 00:11:37.769
Before, it wasn't uncommon to hear students start their comments with expressions like the paragraph says or as the book mentions, now it's not like that.

00:11:37.769 --> 00:11:48.769
In the old way of teaching, it was a bit difficult for me to discern if my Bible students really understood what they were learning or if the truth reached their hearts.

00:11:48.769 --> 00:11:58.769
I think I was using too many additional points to convey one idea and just explaining too much, so my Bible students would get even more confused.

00:11:58.769 --> 00:12:04.769
With some well-educated people, the studies were in a sense too easy for them.

00:12:04.769 --> 00:12:15.769
They found the answer very easily from the paragraph and were able to answer correctly, but it was very hard to know what they really thought about the matter.

00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:23.769
With this new book, it seems like it is easier to see the person's genuine thoughts on the matter.

00:12:23.769 --> 00:12:32.769
In the previous method, you would see the student looking at the book a lot, but that doesn't happen now.

00:12:32.769 --> 00:12:40.769
When you look at the student, you can tell he's thinking about the answer instead of looking for the answer.

00:12:40.769 --> 00:12:47.769
They used to enjoy the Bible study in the past, but now they enjoy it much more.

00:12:47.769 --> 00:12:53.769
Now, they are able to keep focused from the beginning to the end of our session.

00:12:53.769 --> 00:13:00.139
They feel motivated and closer to Jehovah.

00:13:00.139 --> 00:13:06.139
To reach the heart of a Bible student, we need to understand what he's thinking and feeling.

00:13:06.139 --> 00:13:11.139
How does the enjoy life forever book help us to do that?

00:13:11.139 --> 00:13:20.139
One of the things I love about it is how after we read the Bible verse, there's the questions that follow it that are perfectly phrased for us.

00:13:20.139 --> 00:13:29.139
It really engages our students' hearts and it helps them to understand the Bible teachings right away and helps us to see what's in their heart as well.

00:13:29.139 --> 00:13:36.139
It lets the student express what is in his heart, which allows us to help him.

00:13:36.139 --> 00:13:42.139
The first time I looked through this publication, I could already see how appealing its format is.

00:13:42.139 --> 00:13:48.139
There were no lengthy paragraphs, and it was prepared in a very interactive way.

00:13:48.139 --> 00:13:53.139
With this new method, I definitely talk less. My students talk more.

00:13:53.139 --> 00:14:00.139
And the one that starts it all off, the introduction video, it just makes everything fit together.

00:14:00.139 --> 00:14:05.139
And one of the amazing things that it introduces right away is the prayer.

00:14:05.139 --> 00:14:13.139
Because often as a teacher, we didn't know exactly when to introduce prayer or how to do it, but the video does it for us.

00:14:13.139 --> 00:14:17.139
There's some people say the feature is very effective.

00:14:17.139 --> 00:14:25.139
So when the student is able to answer the question, and sometimes even at the scripture, I told them, you know, that could have been in the ministry.

00:14:25.139 --> 00:14:35.460
Obviously, teachers are excited about the new book, but what impact is it having on their students?

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:45.460
Bible students have been pleasantly surprised. I asked one student how they felt to be using this new publication, and the response was,

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:51.460
why didn't we do this sooner? It's great. I'm a lot calmer.

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:59.460
Another student told me that she was relieved to no longer have to find the answers, but rather express her thoughts and feelings.

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:08.460
During our discussion of the dig deeper section in lesson two, my Bible student really appreciated the scriptures and the beautiful artwork.

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:14.460
He said that he could already see himself in paradise, enjoying the many promises of Jehovah.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:19.460
He said that our discussion made him feel Jehovah's love.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:25.460
With the students, they're not so overwhelmed with the new book when we asked them to prepare the lesson.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:31.460
With the Bible Teachbook, when we would ask them to prepare these paragraphs, it was like you asked them to go to the dentist.

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:39.460
They just seemed so intimidated by it, but now they smile and they're like, okay, I can do that.

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:50.460
One student in particular, he wrote in the gold box, because I want to share the points from this lesson with my friends and work colleagues within a week, and he did.

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:57.460
One of the videos that was really effective was the one from lesson four, my search for the true God.

00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.460
It shows the experience of Sister Sotan Yuan.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.460
My students were deeply moved.

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:08.460
They really felt Jehovah's love for them and wanted to speak with him.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:11.460
They felt motivated to pray.

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:19.460
We were studying the first lesson with an 83 year old lady when he came across Matthew chapter 7, verse 7.

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:26.799
She read it in her own Bible, and at first, she didn't quite understand it.

00:16:26.799 --> 00:16:32.690
Then we pounded over the verse together with the question.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:40.690
And then all of a sudden, she asked, oh, does this verse mean that I should dig for the answers in the Bible myself?

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:46.690
Instead of asking a priest, it was quite a special moment.

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:52.690
The video for Learn to Enjoy Bible Reading was very helpful for one young man.

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:58.690
After watching it, he set the goal of reading the Bible every day.

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:05.690
With one Bible student, we had encouraged him to become an unbaptized publisher in the previous study book.

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:13.690
And now when we were in lesson two of our new study, a publication, he expressed the desire to become an unbaptized publisher,

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:21.690
because he felt he could share one or two points from each lesson with his friends and others that he knew.

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:25.690
And so now he's approved, and he's doing very well in the ministry.

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:29.690
Thanks to this new book, I now conduct 15 Bible studies.

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:41.220
The book helps them to maintain the desire and motivation to keep learning about Jehovah, his beautiful qualities, and the future that awaits us.

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:51.220
Clearly, our worldwide brotherhood is excited to use Enjoy Life Forever. What a tremendous gift from Jehovah.

00:17:51.220 --> 00:18:00.220
And then of all the facets of our ministry, without a question, conducting a progressive Bible study is the most satisfying aspect.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:04.220
And now we have the tool and the method to make it much easier.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:13.220
I'm very grateful for this tool. It really helps us to sense how close the governing body recognizes we are to the end.

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:16.220
But it in no way feels like a rushed program.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:22.220
The heart is definitely being reached gently and lovingly, but then that is what motivates quickly.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:26.220
Try and introduce it as much as you can. Start those Bible studies.

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:31.220
And when you do, please invite me to join in on your new Bible study.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:36.220
This book makes Bible teaching very simple and enjoyable.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:41.220
And I am convinced that everyone who tries it will love it.

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:55.220
The new book Enjoy Life Forever shows clearly that the faith on the street slave has been, is, and will continue to give exactly what we need and exactly the right time.

00:18:55.220 --> 00:19:04.220
This publication has the potential to help many more honest-hearted ones come to know and love our wonderful father, Jehovah.

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:10.220
May he bless you and your Bible students, as you put to use this new tool.

00:19:23.769 --> 00:19:30.769
Well, that was very, very encouraging. And we apologize to all those who work in the dental office.

00:19:30.769 --> 00:19:33.769
We do appreciate your hard work.

00:19:33.769 --> 00:19:41.769
Well, no doubt many of you are experiencing similar blessings as you are conducting Bible studies in this wonderful new tool.

00:19:41.769 --> 00:19:49.769
If you're not presently conducting a Bible study, why not make it a matter of earnest prayer to Jehovah?

00:19:49.769 --> 00:19:57.769
Because there's no experience quite like having a Bible study in this wonderful new publication.

00:19:57.769 --> 00:20:08.769
Well, for the past several years, a unique feature of our annual meeting program has been a new so-called epic edition of the Become Jehovah's Friend series.

00:20:08.769 --> 00:20:13.769
We call it an epic because it's longer than the usual episodes.

00:20:13.769 --> 00:20:17.769
We're now pleased to present Become Jehovah's Friend.

00:20:17.769 --> 00:20:20.769
Does God answer prayers?

00:20:20.769 --> 00:20:27.619
Hey, Sophia, we know you're in there.

00:20:27.619 --> 00:20:31.619
Please, Jehovah, make it stop.

00:20:31.619 --> 00:20:34.619
What are we doing?

00:20:34.619 --> 00:20:36.619
Let's go now.

00:20:36.619 --> 00:21:02.000
All right, class.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Today we're going to discuss.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Sophia, you're late.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
I'm sorry.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
I was...

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Never mind.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.210
We'll talk about this later.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:17.210
Okay, okay.

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:18.210
That's enough.

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.210
Sophia, take your seat.

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:27.210
Today, we're going to discuss the difference between division and long division.

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:32.750
Okay, class.

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:35.750
Here are the results from yesterday's test.

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:37.750
Good work, Sophia.

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:44.779
Angela, what you get?

00:21:44.779 --> 00:21:48.150
I don't care.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:49.150
Whoa!

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:50.150
Deep plus?

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:53.150
Well, at least there's a plus.

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:54.150
Whatever.

00:21:54.150 --> 00:22:00.349
What are you looking at?

00:22:00.349 --> 00:22:40.279
I didn't see you there.

00:22:40.279 --> 00:22:43.279
It's like you're invisible.

00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:49.059
Oh, what's this?

00:22:49.059 --> 00:22:57.140
See you tomorrow.

00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:16.900
Okay, let me help.

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:20.849
Sometimes they pick on me too.

00:23:20.849 --> 00:23:36.170
Miss Wilson said I could hold the bunny.

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:38.170
But I had to be very gentle.

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:40.170
Really?

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:42.170
I named him Fred.

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:45.170
But I didn't get to hold him for very long.

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:49.170
I'm pretty much a bunny expert now.

00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:54.220
Is everything all right, honey?

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:59.170
Um, see you tomorrow.

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:03.180
I'm fine.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:15.460
Okay, let's talk about something very important.

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:17.460
Prayer.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:21.460
Caleb, what are some things that you can pray for?

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:25.740
I can pray for things that make me happy.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:30.009
Like a helicopter.

00:24:30.009 --> 00:24:41.160
A mountain of ice cream.

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:48.059
The belly ache.

00:24:48.059 --> 00:24:50.059
I see.

00:24:50.059 --> 00:24:54.059
But tell me, when we pray before bedtime, what do we pray for?

00:24:54.059 --> 00:24:59.400
I'm saying to hope for the good things he made.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:03.400
Like animals, the stars, and the ocean.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:07.700
God's kingdom.

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.700
And to help our brothers and sisters.

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:11.700
That's right.

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:13.700
You can pray for your brothers and sisters.

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:17.700
And remember, they are praying for you too.

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:21.700
We know that when we pray for the right things, Jehovah hears us.

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:25.400
They're my prayers.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.400
Oh, what's wrong, Sophia?

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.940
You can tell us.

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:33.940
There's a girl at school.

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:36.940
She's so mean to me.

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:38.940
Oh, no.

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:43.339
Oh honey, it's okay.

00:25:43.339 --> 00:25:48.940
I prayed for it to stop, but nothing's happened.

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:52.940
Is Jehovah mad at me?

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.940
No, my dear.

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:56.940
Jehovah isn't mad at you.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:00.940
Maybe Jehovah can't see me.

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:06.180
No.

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:10.180
There is someone in the Bible who felt the same way you do.

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:14.180
Her name was Hannah.

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:21.369
Hannah loved Jehovah very much.

00:26:21.369 --> 00:26:30.109
But someone named Penina was very mean to her.

00:26:30.109 --> 00:26:34.109
It's so nice to see the children play, isn't it?

00:26:34.109 --> 00:26:37.359
She had a bully too?

00:26:37.359 --> 00:26:39.359
Yes.

00:26:39.359 --> 00:26:45.869
We're ready to eat.

00:26:45.869 --> 00:26:47.869
Here's your portion, Hannah.

00:26:47.869 --> 00:26:50.869
And Penina, here's yours.

00:26:50.869 --> 00:26:53.869
She was very jealous of Hannah.

00:26:53.869 --> 00:26:59.980
I'll get some water.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:05.180
You think you're so special, Hannah?

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:18.029
Then why hasn't Jehovah given you any children?

00:27:18.029 --> 00:27:20.029
Are you okay, Hannah?

00:27:20.029 --> 00:27:22.029
Why are you so sad?

00:27:22.029 --> 00:27:25.029
Others could not understand why Hannah was so upset.

00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:30.029
Because the pain was in her heart.

00:27:30.029 --> 00:27:34.029
So she talked to the woman who would understand.

00:27:48.109 --> 00:27:54.019
Oh Jehovah, please remember me.

00:27:54.019 --> 00:27:58.019
And do not forgive me.

00:27:58.019 --> 00:28:02.019
Please, give me a child.

00:28:02.019 --> 00:28:15.329
If you do, I will give into you all his life to serve you.

00:28:15.329 --> 00:28:17.329
What are you doing?

00:28:17.329 --> 00:28:21.500
Why are you drunk?

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.500
I'm not drunk.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:26.500
I'm under great stress.

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.500
Oh.

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:33.500
I've been praying for Jehovah to help me.

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.500
Go in peace.

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:38.500
And may Jehovah give you what you've asked for.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:44.900
Do you know why Hannah felt better,

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:47.900
even though her prayer wasn't answered yet?

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:49.900
Why?

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:54.900
Because Hannah knew Jehovah heard her prayer.

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:57.900
When Jehovah listens to your prayers,

00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.900
he really listens.

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:04.900
And he knows just what we need, even better than we do.

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:07.900
But how does he answer them?

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:09.900
In lots of different ways.

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:13.900
Sometimes we just have to wait and see.

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:15.900
Because he's busy?

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:16.900
No.

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:20.900
Because it can be hard for us to see the answer.

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:23.900
Let's talk about what you can pray for.

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:35.710
And what you can do tomorrow at school to work along with those prayers.

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:39.859
Those are going to be mean to me.

00:29:39.859 --> 00:29:42.859
Please help me to be like Hannah tomorrow.

00:29:42.859 --> 00:29:53.910
Help me to be strong like her.

00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:55.910
And then she went to the tabernacle.

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:56.910
And Eli was there.

00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:58.910
He was a high priest.

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:25.740
Who it is?

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:39.960
What do you want, Angela?

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.960
I was just wondering if you had a pen act about her.

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:53.819
Why do?

00:30:53.819 --> 00:30:58.670
Jehovah heard her prayer.

00:30:58.670 --> 00:30:59.670
Jehovah?

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:01.670
It's me, Caleb.

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:07.190
Please help Sophia.

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:08.190
Please.

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:13.190
Help Sophia be strong and slow to watch over the children in our congregation.

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:15.190
Like Caleb and Sophia.

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:17.190
Please watch over our children.

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:20.190
Help our children make you proud, Jelva.

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:21.190
Please, Jelva.

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:24.190
Give our children the strength they need to face for them.

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:25.190
Jehovah.

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:26.190
Please.

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:28.190
It needs your help.

00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:32.859
We ask you to spread out in Jesus' name.

00:31:32.859 --> 00:31:42.309
Are you going to cry?

00:31:42.309 --> 00:31:44.690
Stop, Angela.

00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:46.690
You're being mean.

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:50.690
And if you keep being mean, I'm going to tell.

00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:52.690
No, you won't.

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:53.690
Yes, I will.

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:55.690
You can't tell me what to do.

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:57.690
Let's go, Zoe.

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:10.859
I, sister, I'm so brave.

00:32:10.859 --> 00:32:12.859
How did you do that?

00:32:12.859 --> 00:32:15.859
I prayed for courage and Jehovah helped me.

00:32:15.859 --> 00:32:29.069
And I gave birth to a son and named him Samuel.

00:32:29.069 --> 00:32:32.069
Because, as she said,

00:32:32.069 --> 00:32:35.069
it is from Jehovah that I have asked him.

00:32:35.069 --> 00:32:42.079
There is no one holy like Jehovah.

00:32:42.079 --> 00:32:50.420
There is no one but you.

00:32:50.420 --> 00:33:00.069
Thank you, Jehovah.

00:33:00.069 --> 00:33:05.069
Well, that was truly spiritual food at the proper time.

00:33:05.069 --> 00:33:09.069
And while it will touch the hearts of all of our young ones,

00:33:09.069 --> 00:33:12.069
I think that message is something we all need to hear

00:33:12.069 --> 00:33:15.069
and take to heart at this time.

00:33:15.069 --> 00:33:19.069
Well, now we have the privilege to hear three scriptural talks

00:33:19.069 --> 00:33:21.069
by members of the governing body.

00:33:21.069 --> 00:33:25.069
We'll first enjoy a talk by our dear brother, David Spleen,

00:33:25.069 --> 00:33:29.069
entitled The Way of Holiness.

00:33:29.069 --> 00:33:34.109
Incredible.

00:33:34.109 --> 00:33:38.869
That's the only way to describe it.

00:33:38.869 --> 00:33:42.869
The word had gone out that the Jews

00:33:42.869 --> 00:33:46.869
who had been captives in Babylon were free to leave

00:33:46.869 --> 00:33:50.869
and return to their homeland, Israel.

00:33:50.869 --> 00:33:54.869
Now, you all know why that was incredible.

00:33:54.869 --> 00:33:58.869
Because Babylon never released its captives.

00:33:59.869 --> 00:34:01.869
But Babylon had been overthrown

00:34:01.869 --> 00:34:04.869
and the new administration had said

00:34:04.869 --> 00:34:08.869
that the Jews were free to go.

00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:13.869
Only Jehovah could have been responsible for that.

00:34:13.869 --> 00:34:18.869
So, every family had had a decision to make

00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:24.869
to leave Babylon or to stay behind.

00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:27.869
Now, you might say

00:34:27.869 --> 00:34:29.869
there was no decision to make it all.

00:34:29.869 --> 00:34:31.869
That's not a hard decision.

00:34:31.869 --> 00:34:34.869
But wait, hold it.

00:34:34.869 --> 00:34:38.869
Most of the Jews had been born in Babylon.

00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:44.869
And most of their parents had been born in Babylon.

00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:48.869
It was the only home they knew.

00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:51.869
Their roots were there.

00:34:51.869 --> 00:34:53.869
And according to certain records,

00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:56.869
some of them had gone prosperous.

00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:58.869
Some of them had gone wealthy.

00:34:58.869 --> 00:35:02.869
There are records of Jews buying and selling precious gems

00:35:02.869 --> 00:35:06.869
and other luxury items.

00:35:06.869 --> 00:35:09.869
So, one says,

00:35:09.869 --> 00:35:11.869
I can't leave Babylon.

00:35:11.869 --> 00:35:13.869
My business partner is a Babylonian

00:35:13.869 --> 00:35:15.869
and that business is doing really well

00:35:15.869 --> 00:35:19.869
and there'd be no market for the products we sell in Israel.

00:35:19.869 --> 00:35:21.869
Another would say,

00:35:21.869 --> 00:35:24.869
my son married a Babylonian woman

00:35:24.869 --> 00:35:26.869
and they'd just had a baby.

00:35:26.869 --> 00:35:31.869
Our first grandchild, he's so cute I can't leave now.

00:35:31.869 --> 00:35:32.869
So, on the one hand,

00:35:32.869 --> 00:35:35.869
you have these material benefits

00:35:35.869 --> 00:35:37.869
from remaining in Babylon.

00:35:37.869 --> 00:35:39.869
But on the other hand,

00:35:39.869 --> 00:35:43.869
the ability of the Jews to worship Jehovah freely

00:35:43.869 --> 00:35:45.869
was severely limited.

00:35:45.869 --> 00:35:49.869
It said that there were 50 pagan temples

00:35:49.869 --> 00:35:52.869
in the capital alone.

00:35:52.869 --> 00:35:55.869
But there was no temple of Jehovah there.

00:35:55.869 --> 00:35:59.869
And the Levites weren't able to follow the law of Moses properly.

00:35:59.869 --> 00:36:02.869
They could only do so to a limited degree.

00:36:02.869 --> 00:36:05.869
So, you had material advantages to staying,

00:36:05.869 --> 00:36:08.869
but the spiritual blessings

00:36:08.869 --> 00:36:11.869
that awaited those who chose to leave

00:36:11.869 --> 00:36:13.869
were going to be immense.

00:36:13.869 --> 00:36:16.869
And for spiritually minded Jews,

00:36:16.869 --> 00:36:18.869
it was no contest

00:36:18.869 --> 00:36:20.869
because they wanted to leave Babylon

00:36:20.869 --> 00:36:23.869
and reestablish pure worship

00:36:23.869 --> 00:36:26.869
in the promised land in Israel.

00:36:26.869 --> 00:36:30.869
And so, if they were physically able to do so,

00:36:30.869 --> 00:36:33.869
they would leave Babylon

00:36:33.869 --> 00:36:35.869
and travel to Jerusalem.

00:36:35.869 --> 00:36:39.869
A city, most of them had never seen

00:36:39.869 --> 00:36:43.869
a city in ruins.

00:36:43.869 --> 00:36:48.869
But Jehovah promised to make the trip from Babylon to Jerusalem

00:36:48.869 --> 00:36:51.869
as easy as possible.

00:36:51.869 --> 00:36:54.869
And to confirm that and to get a little picture in our minds,

00:36:54.869 --> 00:36:58.869
we're going to read a series of four different scriptures.

00:36:58.869 --> 00:37:01.869
And each scripture is going to add a little detail

00:37:01.869 --> 00:37:03.869
to what Jehovah had in mind.

00:37:03.869 --> 00:37:07.869
So, the first one is founded Isaiah chapter 40,

00:37:07.869 --> 00:37:10.869
verses 3 and 4.

00:37:10.869 --> 00:37:12.869
And I'll wait a moment because it'd be good

00:37:12.869 --> 00:37:14.869
if we could read this together.

00:37:14.869 --> 00:37:17.869
This is Isaiah chapter 40.

00:37:17.869 --> 00:37:23.699
The well-known words of verses 3 and 4.

00:37:23.699 --> 00:37:27.699
A voice of one calling in the wilderness

00:37:27.699 --> 00:37:30.699
clear up the way of Jehovah.

00:37:30.699 --> 00:37:35.699
Make a straight highway through the desert.

00:37:35.699 --> 00:37:39.699
A straight highway through the desert for our God.

00:37:39.699 --> 00:37:42.699
Let every valley be raised up

00:37:42.699 --> 00:37:45.699
and every mountain and hill be made low.

00:37:45.699 --> 00:37:47.699
The rough ground must become level

00:37:47.699 --> 00:37:51.699
and the rugged ground of valley plain.

00:37:51.699 --> 00:37:53.699
In every time I read these words,

00:37:53.699 --> 00:37:56.699
I think of Brother Kerry Barber.

00:37:56.699 --> 00:37:59.699
He must have loved this passage because very often,

00:37:59.699 --> 00:38:03.699
in his prayers, he would quote this passage word for word,

00:38:03.699 --> 00:38:06.699
good memories of Brother Barber.

00:38:06.699 --> 00:38:10.699
But now, it talks about making a straight highway

00:38:10.699 --> 00:38:12.699
through the desert.

00:38:12.699 --> 00:38:16.699
If some of you have gone to the Ramapul project,

00:38:16.699 --> 00:38:20.699
you know what site work is all about.

00:38:20.699 --> 00:38:23.699
How would you like to have the construction committee

00:38:23.699 --> 00:38:26.699
in Ramapul take that job on?

00:38:26.699 --> 00:38:28.699
Make a straight highway through the desert.

00:38:28.699 --> 00:38:31.699
When you come to a mountain, you've got to level it.

00:38:31.699 --> 00:38:33.699
You come to a valley you've got to bring it up.

00:38:33.699 --> 00:38:35.699
That would be quite a job.

00:38:35.699 --> 00:38:37.699
I think they have enough on their plate.

00:38:37.699 --> 00:38:39.699
They don't need to worry about this kind of site work.

00:38:39.699 --> 00:38:41.699
But this was going to be a big job,

00:38:41.699 --> 00:38:44.699
but in the end, it would be a lot easier

00:38:44.699 --> 00:38:49.699
to travel on a straight highway than to go up and down a mountain

00:38:49.699 --> 00:38:50.699
or down a valley.

00:38:50.699 --> 00:38:53.699
And it would be a lot faster, too.

00:38:53.699 --> 00:38:56.699
So we know that there's going to be a straight highway

00:38:56.699 --> 00:38:59.699
between Babylon and Jerusalem.

00:38:59.699 --> 00:39:01.699
What else can we learn?

00:39:01.699 --> 00:39:13.389
Isaiah 57, Isaiah 57 and verse 14.

00:39:13.389 --> 00:39:16.389
Verse 14 says, it will be said, build up.

00:39:16.389 --> 00:39:18.389
Build up a road.

00:39:18.389 --> 00:39:21.389
Prepare the way, and here it comes.

00:39:21.389 --> 00:39:26.389
Remove any obstacle from the way of my people.

00:39:26.389 --> 00:39:28.389
So now we have two details.

00:39:28.389 --> 00:39:31.389
It's going to be a straight highway through the desert

00:39:31.389 --> 00:39:36.389
and all of the obstacles are going to be cleared away.

00:39:36.389 --> 00:39:39.389
But not most highways have a name.

00:39:39.389 --> 00:39:41.389
Some of them are named after famous people.

00:39:41.389 --> 00:39:43.389
Others have a number.

00:39:43.389 --> 00:39:46.389
Does this special highway have a name?

00:39:46.389 --> 00:39:47.389
It does.

00:39:47.389 --> 00:39:52.389
When we go to Isaiah 35, 8 to 10 to find that name.

00:39:52.389 --> 00:39:57.760
I'm giving you a real workout this morning.

00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:00.760
But we have to do this to put it all together.

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:04.760
Isaiah 35 verses 8 to 10.

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:09.760
And a highway will be there, yes, a way called.

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:13.760
Here it comes, the way of holiness.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:16.760
The unclean one will not travel on it.

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:19.760
It is reserved for the one walking on the way.

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:22.760
No one foolish will stray onto it.

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:25.760
No lion will be there.

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:29.760
And no vicious wild beasts will come on it.

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.760
They will not be found there.

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:35.760
Only the repurchased ones will walk there.

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:37.760
So what's the name?

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.760
What's the special name of this highway?

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.760
The way of holiness.

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.760
Isn't that a nice name for a highway?

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:52.760
Rattlesnakes, bears, foxes, and cougars are not allowed.

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:55.760
I don't care how cute you think they are.

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:58.760
They're not allowed on this special highway.

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:04.760
Now, what else can we learn about this special highway?

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:09.760
Today, you don't know who's traveling in the car next to yours.

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:13.760
It could be somebody who has no business driving a car.

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:15.760
The driver could be drunk.

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.760
He could be on drugs.

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:22.760
But on this highway, the unclean one is not permitted.

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:27.760
Those who would break God's laws are not permitted to travel on that highway.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:32.760
Well, we're talking about the highway between Babylon and Jerusalem.

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:37.760
And no doubt unclean ones among the Jews wouldn't be interested in going back to Israel anyway.

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:42.760
They were probably very much at home with the idolatry of Babylon.

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:46.760
Remember, their forefathers were no strangers to idolatry.

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:55.760
So only those who were clean and acceptable in Jehovah's eyes were welcome to travel from Babylon back to Jerusalem.

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.760
Now, let's be clear.

00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:05.760
We don't know whether there was any literal road work done on the road between Babylon and Israel.

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:09.760
It may be all figurative, but there could have been some road work done.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:19.289
Notice what Jehovah told the Jews to do in Jeremiah chapter 31 and verse 21.

00:42:19.289 --> 00:42:26.289
And you'd say, why would Jehovah say all of these things if it was all to be ignored literally?

00:42:26.289 --> 00:42:30.289
Jeremiah 31 and verse 21.

00:42:30.289 --> 00:42:36.289
He says, set up road markers for yourself and put up signposts.

00:42:36.289 --> 00:42:40.289
Pay attention to the highway, the way that you have to go.

00:42:40.289 --> 00:42:46.289
Return over Virgin of Israel. Return to these cities of yours.

00:42:46.289 --> 00:42:55.289
So no doubt the first groups to use the road would remove obstacles and level things out the best they could

00:42:55.289 --> 00:42:59.289
so that those who followed would have an easier journey.

00:42:59.289 --> 00:43:03.289
So now what have we learned? What have we gleaned from this series of scriptures?

00:43:03.289 --> 00:43:08.289
First, there's a highway, a highway through the desert.

00:43:08.289 --> 00:43:12.289
We've also learned that it's to be cleared of obstacles.

00:43:12.289 --> 00:43:16.289
It has a special name, the way of holiness.

00:43:16.289 --> 00:43:25.289
And there were to be signposts so that those who traveled the road wouldn't get lost and may be stray onto some other road.

00:43:25.289 --> 00:43:27.289
Now what was the goal?

00:43:27.289 --> 00:43:31.289
Why did Jehovah want this road to be prepared so nicely?

00:43:31.289 --> 00:43:44.289
To make it as easy as possible for the Jews to leave Babylon and go back to Israel and reestablish pure worship.

00:43:44.289 --> 00:43:46.289
Did it work?

00:43:46.289 --> 00:43:55.289
Tens of thousands of men, women, and children responded to the call, the invitation and which Jehovah's help,

00:43:55.289 --> 00:43:59.289
they arrived safely at their destination.

00:43:59.289 --> 00:44:05.289
Well, you might be thinking this is all very nice, but what does it have to do with me?

00:44:05.289 --> 00:44:10.289
What does it have to do with us today? Plenty.

00:44:10.289 --> 00:44:19.289
Because today, not tens of thousands, but millions of men, women, and children are responding to the command,

00:44:19.289 --> 00:44:25.289
the urgent command, get out of her, get out of Babylon the Great.

00:44:25.289 --> 00:44:31.289
And the situation is different from the situation of the Jews in ancient times, because they had a choice.

00:44:31.289 --> 00:44:38.289
They could remain in Babylon and still serve Jehovah, but people today have no choice.

00:44:38.289 --> 00:44:45.289
They must leave Babylon the Great. Their life depends on it.

00:44:45.289 --> 00:44:53.289
Now without looking for a type and anti-type and trying to fit everything in very neatly in this arrangement,

00:44:53.289 --> 00:45:01.289
we can see that there are some similarities between what happened to the Jews in ancient times and what is happening today.

00:45:01.289 --> 00:45:10.289
Because in a sense, when you start to study the Bible with someone, you are pointing him in the direction of the way of holiness.

00:45:10.289 --> 00:45:17.289
Now some start studying and they start traveling on the road and then they turn back, but others keep going,

00:45:17.289 --> 00:45:22.289
and they become dedicated, baptized disciples of Christ.

00:45:22.289 --> 00:45:27.289
Some travel in the fast lane. They make rapid progress.

00:45:27.289 --> 00:45:33.289
Others court of take the far right lane and they poke along, but they keep making progress.

00:45:33.289 --> 00:45:38.289
And as long as they keep making progress, we'll study with them.

00:45:38.289 --> 00:45:42.289
Some break down, and that calls for roadside assistance.

00:45:42.289 --> 00:45:50.860
But it's easier to travel on the way of holiness today than it ever has been.

00:45:50.860 --> 00:46:00.860
And friends, this is partly due to the spiritual sight work that was started centuries ago.

00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:12.860
I'm going to repeat that. It is easier to travel the highway of holiness today because of the spiritual sight work that was started hundreds of years ago.

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:20.860
Long before Babylon the Great fell, long before the road was open for travelers.

00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:25.860
Now picture this. It's the 16th century.

00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:32.860
With shovel in hand, you are about to start sight work on the way of holiness.

00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:37.860
There's a mountain ahead of you, a mountain of ignorance.

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:41.860
And you realize that if you're going to start to level that mountain,

00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:46.860
the first thing you're going to have to do is get the Bible into the hands of the people.

00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:49.860
That for years the Bible was only in Latin.

00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:52.860
And mostly educated people could read it.

00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:57.860
And even some of the clergy only knew enough Latin to conduct church services,

00:46:57.860 --> 00:47:00.860
but otherwise they couldn't understand it.

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:07.860
Well, if you've been to our beautiful museum, some of you have taken a tour recently,

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:13.860
you know that translators in many countries risk their freedom and even their lives

00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:16.860
to put the Bible into the language of the common people.

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:20.860
And then printers produced those translations.

00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:25.860
And some of them used an assumed name because if they got caught printing a Bible,

00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:29.860
they could be arrested and even worse.

00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:34.860
So the mountain had to be leveled a shovelful at a time,

00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:42.860
one Bible at a time to reduce that mountain on the way of holiness.

00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:48.860
To get the Bible into the hands of the people, William Tyndall arranged to have thousands

00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:55.860
of copies of his translations smuggled into England in bails of cotton and other goods.

00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:57.860
This was dangerous.

00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:00.860
Tyndall's translation was banned in England.

00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:03.860
And if you merely possessed a copy of the Bible,

00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:07.860
that could bring you a stint in the Tower of London or worse.

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:12.860
But despite desperate attempts to stop work on the way of holiness,

00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:19.860
more copies of Tyndall's Bible were printed than the clergy could ever destroy.

00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:22.860
By the way, you'll be interested in a comment that Tyndall made

00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:28.860
in his comments on the book of Genesis, 1530, translation of the book of Genesis.

00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:32.860
He wrote, Chahova is God's name.

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:35.860
Neither is any creature so called.

00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:42.860
As oft as thou seeest Lord in capital letters, it is in Hebrew Chahova.

00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:47.860
Early on, the name Chahova was given some recognition.

00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:52.860
Well, with the Bible becoming more available to the people,

00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:57.860
you'd expect that the students of the Bible would want to share their research with others.

00:48:57.860 --> 00:48:59.860
And that was the case.

00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:03.860
In the years leading up to 1919, when Bible and the Great Fell,

00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:05.860
more road work was done.

00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:11.860
And so we have men who share the footage of the research and tracks in books,

00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:15.860
publications of all kinds, because they want the people to know.

00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:19.860
They want to reduce that mountain of ignorance.

00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:25.860
For example, about 1835, a Bible student by the name of Henry Gru,

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:29.860
wrote a pamphlet on the immortality of the soul.

00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:36.860
And in that pamphlet, Gru explained from the Bible that immortality is a reward for faithfulness

00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:38.860
or not born with it.

00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:43.860
Now, he published the track anonymously, because he knew there'd be trouble.

00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:47.860
And later on, there was trouble for Henry Gru.

00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:49.860
Well, he publishes a track.

00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:55.860
But two years later, another Bible student, George Stores, is riding into train.

00:49:55.860 --> 00:50:00.860
And he looks down, and he sees a track there.

00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:04.860
And it's Henry Gru's track on the immortality of the soul.

00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:09.860
He reads it, and he becomes convinced that man doesn't have an immortal soul.

00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:10.860
So what does he do?

00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:14.860
He picks up a shovel, and he starts working on the road.

00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:17.860
The road, the way of holiness.

00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:22.860
In 1842, he gave a series of lectures on the intriguing theme,

00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:25.860
Are the Wicked Immortal.

00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:27.860
And he later published those lectures.

00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:30.860
Do you know how many copies were produced?

00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:36.860
200,000 copies of that series of lectures.

00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:40.860
So that was decent road work on that way of holiness.

00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:44.860
Well, Stores knew that he didn't have the whole truth on every subject.

00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:49.860
And in 1847, he made quite an interesting statement, it'd be interesting for us.

00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:56.860
He says, we do well to remember that we have just emerged from the dark ages of the church.

00:50:56.860 --> 00:51:05.860
And notice this, it would not be strange if we should find some Babylonish garments still worn by us.

00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:09.860
Well, he was right.

00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:13.860
Babylon still had influence in those days.

00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:19.860
Well, we know that George Stores had an influence on Charles T's Russell.

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:23.860
And what do we know about Brother Russell and his associates?

00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:28.860
They weren't the first to discover that the Trinity and the immortality of the soul

00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:34.860
are false doctrines, or even that Christ's presence would be invisible to the human eye.

00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:42.860
They benefited from the careful preparatory work that other road workers had done in the past.

00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:50.860
So, translators, printers, and Bible students were doing spiritual sight work.

00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:57.860
And we might say that Brother Russell and his associates put the final touches on that way of holiness.

00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:06.860
Well, Babylon the Great fell in 1919, and then the way of holiness was open for travelers.

00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:10.860
But Brother Russell died in 1916.

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:13.860
Did he miss it?

00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:16.860
Did he miss the inauguration of the road?

00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:18.860
I don't think so.

00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:22.860
He didn't have a bird's eye view of the opening of the road.

00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:25.860
He had a heaven's eye view.

00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:31.860
Because Brother Russell and his associates, who had finished their earthly course,

00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:36.860
they were able to look down from the heavens, and can you imagine how excited they were?

00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:41.860
When they saw the first travelers set foot on the way of holiness,

00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:45.860
they must have been very exciting for them indeed.

00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:53.860
And it wouldn't be surprising if Brother Russell and his associates were firmly involved

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:57.860
in the maintenance program of that way of holiness today,

00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:02.860
because every good road needs ongoing maintenance.

00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:08.860
The way of holiness is open, but maintenance on that way of holiness goes on.

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:10.860
And what's the goal?

00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:17.860
It's to make it as easy as possible for people to identify Babylon the Great and to leave Babylon the Great.

00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:19.860
That is the goal.

00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:22.860
We'll take the Bible, for example.

00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:25.860
There were Bible translations in 1919.

00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:31.860
But some of them were in archaic language that was hard to understand,

00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:36.860
and most of them didn't give the divine name the place of honor that it deserved.

00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:39.860
But now we have the New World translation.

00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:41.860
What a blessing that has proved to be.

00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:46.860
It's so clear, and you don't have to mortgage the house to buy a copy,

00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:49.860
that will be the case in the 16th century.

00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:57.860
And since 1919, there's been an abundance of spiritual food to make it easier for people to come into the truth.

00:53:57.860 --> 00:53:59.860
Now just think of this.

00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:02.860
In 1919, Babylon the Great fell.

00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:05.860
But what else happened in 1919?

00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:09.860
What provision did Jehovah make for these people?

00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:13.860
The faithful and discreet slave was appointed in that same year.

00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:22.860
And the slave didn't waste any time to start producing literature that was going to make it easier for people to come into the truth.

00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:26.860
1919, the slave was appointed by 1921.

00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:31.860
You have a brand new publication, the harp of God.

00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:38.860
And it was especially designed for beginners and to make it easy for people to study and read and come into the truth.

00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:47.860
And that was necessary because in 1921 there was a shortage of teachers, our publishers who could conduct Bible studies with people.

00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:50.860
So you really needed something simple.

00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:55.860
And comparatively speaking, that harp of God was simple.

00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:59.860
Now there were very few publishers in those days, just a few thousand.

00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:02.860
But they were workers. They did a tremendous job.

00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:07.860
Do you realize that before the harp of God went out of print?

00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:14.860
Almost six million copies in 22 languages had been circulated.

00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:24.860
So this is evidence that maintenance work on the way of holiness had begun right after the road opened.

00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:32.860
Well, I doubt that very many in this audience have come into the truth through the harp of God, anybody here?

00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:34.860
I don't think so.

00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:38.860
What publication brought you into the truth?

00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:42.860
What publication helped you to identify the way of holiness?

00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:46.860
Was it the truth shall make you free?

00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:48.860
Let God be true.

00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:51.860
The truth that leads to eternal life.

00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:53.860
You can live forever.

00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:55.860
The knowledge book.

00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:58.860
Enjoy life forever.

00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:01.860
Teach us. What does the Bible teach us?

00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:04.860
Is it our fine new publication?

00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:06.860
Enjoy life forever.

00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:12.860
All of these publications have been used to help people to break free from babbling the great.

00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:19.860
And this is proof positive that maintenance on the way of holiness is ongoing.

00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:25.860
This road work continues and it gets better and better.

00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:29.860
Are you studying the Bible with someone with the help of enjoy life forever?

00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:34.860
If you are, you're pointing that person to the way of holiness.

00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:40.860
So don't be afraid to offer studies as brother Sanderson mentioned.

00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:49.860
Business associates, relatives, schoolmates, anybody you can think of offer Bible studies and you'll be surprised at who will take you up on it.

00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:55.860
And as you do, keep in mind that while the road has been made easier for travelers,

00:56:55.860 --> 00:56:58.860
setting foot on that road takes courage and effort.

00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:03.860
So let's be ready to help those who are willing to respond.

00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:12.860
Millions have already taken that road and is our hope that millions more will do so before the end of this system of things.

00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:24.340
And we wish them all safe travels.

00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:30.340
Well, we sincerely thank you for this point for that fascinating discussion about the way of holiness.

00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:40.340
You know, I once had the opportunity to go to an auction house and actually hold in my hands the tindal pentatoke of 1530,

00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:43.340
of which there are only a very few known copies.

00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:53.340
But sadly, I didn't have $650,000 in my wallet on that day, nor a house to mortgage.

00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:55.340
So we had to pass.

00:57:55.340 --> 00:58:04.340
But in our museum, we do have a facsimile and want to be a wonderful day when we can reopen our museums, detours from all of our brothers outside,

00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:07.340
and they'll be able to come back and see those wonderful things.

00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:10.340
Thank you so much for this point.

00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:15.340
Well, now we have the pleasure to hear from another member of our governing body, Brother Jeffrey Jackson.

00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:18.340
He has a very intriguing theme.

00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:23.000
Are you there?

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000
Are you there?

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000
Is your name there?

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.000
Is your name written in the book of life?

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000
What book of life?

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:40.000
Well, in Malachi, chapter three, we notice that it refers to a book of remembrance.

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:49.000
And this book has a record of all those who feared Jehovah and treasure his name.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:56.000
Yes, this book of remembrance is a record of all those who are in line to receive everlasting life.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:02.000
So all of us want to have our names written in that book, don't we?

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:12.000
But if we do have our book named in that book, does that mean automatically that we will receive everlasting life?

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.000
No.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:18.000
We remember what Jehovah said to Moses as recorded in Exodus 32,

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:25.000
that he said, anyone who sins against me, I will wipe out from my book.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:31.000
So names can be erased from this book of life.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:36.000
It's as if our names are written in this book of life in pencil.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:49.000
So all of us surely want to make sure that our names remain in this book of life right through to the time that they are written permanently in the book in pen as it were.

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:54.000
But whose names are in this book of life?

00:59:54.000 --> 01:00:04.000
We're going to consider together five different groups of persons, some of whom have their names in the book of life and others don't.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:09.000
So let's watch this presentation that discusses these five groups.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:27.469
The first group, those who have been selected to rule with Jesus in heaven, are their names written in this book of life?

01:00:27.469 --> 01:00:33.469
According to Philippians 4-3, the answer is yes.

01:00:33.469 --> 01:00:44.469
But even though they have been anointed with Holy Spirit, they still need to remain faithful in order to have their names written permanently in this book.

01:00:44.469 --> 01:00:49.469
The second group, the great crowd of Armageddon survivors.

01:00:49.469 --> 01:00:54.469
Are the names of these faithful ones now written in the book of life?

01:00:54.469 --> 01:00:56.469
Yes.

01:00:56.469 --> 01:00:59.469
What about after they survive Armageddon?

01:00:59.469 --> 01:01:02.469
Will their names still be in the book of life?

01:01:02.469 --> 01:01:04.469
Yes.

01:01:04.469 --> 01:01:06.469
How do we know?

01:01:06.469 --> 01:01:15.469
At Matthew 25-46, Jesus says that these sheep like ones depart into everlasting life.

01:01:15.469 --> 01:01:21.469
But does that mean they are granted everlasting life at the beginning of the thousand year reign?

01:01:21.469 --> 01:01:23.469
No.

01:01:23.469 --> 01:01:31.469
Revelation 7-17 tells us that Jesus will guide them to springs of waters of life.

01:01:31.469 --> 01:01:35.469
So they don't immediately receive everlasting life.

01:01:35.469 --> 01:01:40.469
However, their names are written in the book of life in pencil as it were.

01:01:40.469 --> 01:01:50.469
The third group, the goats who will be destroyed at Armageddon, their names are not in the book of life.

01:01:50.469 --> 01:02:01.469
Second Thessalonians 1-9 tells us, these very ones will undergo the judicial punishment of everlasting destruction.

01:02:01.469 --> 01:02:07.469
The same could be said of those who have deliberately sinned against the Holy Spirit.

01:02:07.469 --> 01:02:14.469
They too receive everlasting destruction, not everlasting life.

01:02:15.469 --> 01:02:22.469
So the first three groups are, the anointed, the great crowd, and the goats.

01:02:22.469 --> 01:02:27.469
Of these three, only two are found in the book of life.

01:02:27.469 --> 01:02:35.469
Now let's talk about two more groups, those who will be resurrected in the new world.

01:02:35.469 --> 01:02:40.469
First though, let's read together Acts 24-15.

01:02:40.469 --> 01:02:48.469
There the Apostle Paul says, I have hoped toward God, which hope these men also look forward to,

01:02:48.469 --> 01:02:56.469
that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.

01:02:56.469 --> 01:03:00.469
So the fourth group are the righteous who have died.

01:03:00.469 --> 01:03:03.469
These include some of our loved ones.

01:03:03.469 --> 01:03:06.469
Are their names written in the book of life?

01:03:06.469 --> 01:03:08.469
Yes.

01:03:08.469 --> 01:03:15.469
Revelation 17-8 tells us that this book has been in existence since the founding of the world.

01:03:15.469 --> 01:03:20.469
Jesus referred to Abel as living from the founding of the world.

01:03:20.469 --> 01:03:25.469
So we can assume that his name was the first name written in that book.

01:03:25.469 --> 01:03:32.469
Since that time, millions of other righteous ones have had their names added to this book.

01:03:32.469 --> 01:03:36.469
Now here's an important question.

01:03:36.469 --> 01:03:42.469
When these righteous ones died, were their names taken out of the book of life?

01:03:42.469 --> 01:03:44.469
No.

01:03:44.469 --> 01:03:47.469
They're still living in Jehovah's memory.

01:03:47.469 --> 01:03:53.469
Remember Jesus said that Jehovah is a God not of the dead, but of the living,

01:03:53.469 --> 01:03:56.469
for they are all living to him.

01:03:56.469 --> 01:04:03.469
The righteous will be restored to life here on earth with their names still written in the book of life.

01:04:03.469 --> 01:04:06.469
They did good things before they died.

01:04:06.469 --> 01:04:13.469
So that is why they will be part of the resurrection of the righteous ones.

01:04:13.469 --> 01:04:20.469
No doubt some of them will receive privileges, such as serving as princes in all the earth.

01:04:20.469 --> 01:04:25.469
Finally, let's talk about the resurrection of the unrighteous.

01:04:25.469 --> 01:04:32.469
For the most part, the unrighteous didn't have an opportunity to develop a relationship with Jehovah.

01:04:32.469 --> 01:04:39.469
They did not live righteous lives, so that's why they are called unrighteous.

01:04:39.469 --> 01:04:45.469
When these unrighteous ones are resurrected, are their names written in the book of life?

01:04:45.469 --> 01:04:47.469
No.

01:04:47.469 --> 01:04:55.469
But they're being resurrected gives them an opportunity to have their names eventually written in the book of life.

01:04:55.469 --> 01:05:00.469
These unrighteous ones will need a lot of help.

01:05:00.469 --> 01:05:06.469
In their former life, some of them practiced horrible, vile things.

01:05:06.469 --> 01:05:10.469
So they'll need to learn to live by Jehovah's standards.

01:05:10.469 --> 01:05:21.880
To accomplish this, God's kingdom will sponsor the greatest education program in all human history.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:24.880
Who will teach these unrighteous persons?

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:32.880
Those who have their names written in pencil in the book of life, the great crowd and the resurrected righteous ones.

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:38.880
How can these unrighteous ones have their names written in the book of life?

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:45.880
They will need to develop a relationship with Jehovah and dedicate their lives to him.

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:50.880
But will all the unrighteous accept that opportunity?

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:51.880
No.

01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:59.880
Remember, all these unrighteous ones will be under the careful watch of Jesus and His fellow judges.

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:07.880
Isaiah 65-20 tells us that those who refuse to accept this help will be removed.

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:11.880
No one will be allowed to cause any ruin in the new world.

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:18.880
So any who display a wicked attitude during the thousand years will be removed.

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:28.880
With all these facts in mind then, let's now read together John 5, 28, and 29.

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:39.880
Jesus said, do not be amazed at this, for the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear His voice and come out.

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:49.880
Those who do good things to a resurrection of life and those who practice vile things to a resurrection of judgment.

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:59.699
Now, for a few moments, let's think about those verses in John 5, 28, and 29.

01:06:59.699 --> 01:07:10.699
Up to now, we have understood Jesus' words to mean that the resurrected ones will do good things and some will do vile things.

01:07:10.699 --> 01:07:13.699
Vile things after their resurrection.

01:07:13.699 --> 01:07:24.699
But notice there in verse 29, Jesus didn't say they will do these good things or they will practice vile things.

01:07:24.699 --> 01:07:26.699
He used the past tense, didn't he?

01:07:26.699 --> 01:07:32.699
Because he said they did good things and they practiced vile things.

01:07:32.699 --> 01:07:45.699
So this would indicate to us that these deeds or actions were committed by these ones prior to their death and before they would be resurrected.

01:07:45.699 --> 01:07:53.699
So that makes sense, doesn't it, because no one's going to be allowed to practice vile things in a new world.

01:07:53.699 --> 01:07:59.699
So what did Jesus mean when He mentioned these two factors?

01:07:59.699 --> 01:08:10.699
Well, for a start, we could say the righteous ones still, when they're resurrected, have their names written in the book of life.

01:08:10.699 --> 01:08:17.699
It's true, Romans chapter 6 verse 7 says that when someone dies, his sins are canceled.

01:08:17.699 --> 01:08:24.699
But take note of this, not the record of faithfulness. That's not canceled.

01:08:24.699 --> 01:08:33.699
So the righteous ones are resurrected into the new world and their names are still in the book of life.

01:08:33.699 --> 01:08:40.699
Of course, they need to remain faithful during the thousand years to keep their names in that book of life.

01:08:40.699 --> 01:08:43.699
But what about the unrighteous ones?

01:08:43.699 --> 01:08:48.699
Well, these are the ones who did vile things before they died.

01:08:48.699 --> 01:08:55.699
So when they're resurrected, they don't have their names in the book of life. It's not a resurrection to life.

01:08:55.699 --> 01:08:59.699
It's a resurrection to judgment.

01:08:59.699 --> 01:09:02.699
Now, why do we say that?

01:09:02.699 --> 01:09:10.699
Because there we could say the word judgment is not referring to a condemnation.

01:09:10.699 --> 01:09:15.699
It's not referring to something that is totally negative.

01:09:15.699 --> 01:09:19.699
It's true at times the word judgment can have that meaning.

01:09:19.699 --> 01:09:29.699
But in the context of these verses, it seems that Jesus is using the word judgment in a more neutral sense.

01:09:29.699 --> 01:09:35.699
So it means more in evaluation or appropriation period.

01:09:35.699 --> 01:09:45.699
So the unrighteous ones will have an opportunity to accept this wonderful education work that's going to be done in the new world.

01:09:45.699 --> 01:09:49.699
And during that time, they will be evaluated.

01:09:49.699 --> 01:09:58.699
And if they dedicate their lives to Jehovah, then their names will be written into the book of life.

01:09:58.699 --> 01:10:05.699
Now, at this point, you're probably thinking, is this an adjustment to our understanding?

01:10:05.699 --> 01:10:08.699
Yes, it is.

01:10:08.699 --> 01:10:14.180
So now you think, now can you just run that past me again?

01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:18.180
Well, let's look at this little summary that will help us.

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:26.180
When Jesus spoke in John 529 of those who would receive a resurrection of life,

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:36.180
he was referring to those who did good things before they died, those whose names are written in the book of life.

01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:52.180
The resurrection of judgment at John 529 involves the resurrection of those who practice vile things before they died, and whose names are not yet written in the book of life.

01:10:52.180 --> 01:11:04.180
But where the previously righteous or unrighteous, all these resurrected ones will need to obey the laws in the new scrolls referred to in Revelation 20 verse 12.

01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:06.180
There it says,

01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:13.180
I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and scrolls were opened.

01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:18.180
But another scroll was opened, it is the scroll of life.

01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:25.180
The dead were judged out of those things written in the scrolls, according to their deeds.

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:32.180
Yes, they will be judged individually, according to their deeds.

01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:44.180
But what deeds? Will it be their deeds committed before they died? No, otherwise the resurrection of the unrighteous would have been a pointless waste.

01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:58.180
Here then, their deeds cannot be deeds from their former life, rather this verse must refer to their deeds in response to their training in the new world.

01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:09.180
Even such faithful men as Noah, Samuel, David, and Daniel will have to learn about the sacrifice of Christ and exercise faith in it.

01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:16.180
All of this also helps us to understand an amazing prophecy in the book of Daniel.

01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:23.180
Let's turn there. It's Daniel 12 verses 1 through 3.

01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:32.180
There it says, during that time, Michael, who is Jesus Christ, will stand up, that is at Armageddon,

01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:40.180
the great prince who is standing since 1914 in behalf of your people.

01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:51.180
And they will occur a time of distress, that is the great tribulation, such as has not occurred since there came to be a nation until that time.

01:12:51.180 --> 01:13:02.180
And during that time, your people will escape. Everyone who has found written down in the book, and this refers to the great crowd.

01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:19.579
But notice what follows, and many of those asleep in the dust of the earth will wake up, some to everlasting life, and others to reproach and to everlasting contempt.

01:13:19.579 --> 01:13:28.579
So looking at Daniel 12 and verse 2, it seems appropriate to that we are just our understanding of this verse.

01:13:28.579 --> 01:13:41.579
Notice there it speaks about people waking up in the form of a resurrection, and this occurs after what's mentioned in verse 1, after the great crowd survived the great tribulation.

01:13:41.579 --> 01:13:49.579
So this obviously is talking about a literal resurrection of the righteous and unrighteous.

01:13:49.579 --> 01:14:01.579
But what does it mean, when it mentions there in verse 2, that some will be erased to everlasting life, and others to everlasting contempt?

01:14:01.579 --> 01:14:04.579
What does that really mean?

01:14:05.579 --> 01:14:13.579
Well, when we notice that, we notice there's a little different from what Jesus said in John chapter 5, he spoke about life and judgment.

01:14:13.579 --> 01:14:21.579
But now here it's talking about everlasting life, and everlasting contempt.

01:14:21.579 --> 01:14:34.579
So that term everlasting helps us to realize that this is talking about the final outcome after these ones have had an opportunity to accept the education.

01:14:34.579 --> 01:14:45.579
So those who are resurrected who make good use of this education, well, they will continue on and ultimately receive everlasting life.

01:14:45.579 --> 01:14:56.579
But then on the other hand, any who refuse to accept the benefits of that education, they will be judged as worthy of eternal destruction.

01:14:56.579 --> 01:14:59.579
Now let's finally read verse 3.

01:14:59.579 --> 01:15:14.380
And those having insight will shine as brightly as the expansive heaven, and those bringing the many to righteousness like the stars, forever and ever.

01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:21.380
This is speaking about the massive education work that will be done in the new world.

01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:32.380
The glorified andointed ones will shine brightly as they work closely with Jesus to direct the education work that will bring the many to righteousness.

01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:39.380
What a joy it will be for them to take part in this amazing work in their role as priests.

01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:43.380
They will assist with the healing of the nations.

01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:52.380
And what a privilege it will be to see obedient humans become free from the burden of sin and death and gain perfection.

01:15:52.380 --> 01:16:05.460
Of course, we have to realize that at that time on earth there won't be just resurrected ones, will they?

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:11.460
There will be the survivors of Armageddon and any children that are born in the new world.

01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:16.460
These ones will ultimately attain to perfection.

01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:22.460
So is that when they get their names written as it were in ink in the book?

01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:26.460
Not quite yet. Why not?

01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:32.460
Well, because perfection doesn't automatically mean that someone would get everlasting life.

01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:35.460
Remember the case of Adam and Eve, they were perfect.

01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:42.460
But before they could attain to everlasting life, they had to prove their obedience to Jehovah.

01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:48.460
Yes. So we realized then that in the case of Adam and Eve, they failed.

01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:54.460
So a question is raised with regard to all these perfect ones on the earth at that time.

01:16:54.460 --> 01:17:01.460
The resurrected ones, the survivors of the great tribulation as well as any children that will have been born.

01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:08.460
Will they stand faithful? Will they continue to support Jehovah's sovereignty?

01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:15.460
Or will some of them be like Adam and Eve? Be perfect, but then unfaithful.

01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:23.460
Well, the book of Revelation helps us to understand that to answer that question Satan is released from the symbolic prison.

01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:29.460
And he has an opportunity to test the integrity of Jehovah's servants.

01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:39.460
So each person on earth will have a personal opportunity to show where they stand on the issue of universal sovereignty.

01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:48.460
And their individual response will show whether or not their names should be written permanently in the book of life.

01:17:48.460 --> 01:17:55.460
Some, an unspecified number, will turn their backs on Jehovah and will not support his sovereignty.

01:17:55.460 --> 01:18:00.460
What will happen to those? Well, Revelation 20 verse 15 tells us doesn't it?

01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:08.460
Anyone who isn't found written in the book of life will receive everlasting destruction.

01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:18.460
But this is the good news. The majority of perfect mankind will find themselves passing the final test.

01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:23.460
Yes, and their names will be written permanently in the book of life.

01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:28.460
Isn't that exciting to think about what's going to happen in the future?

01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:38.460
Yes, now is the time Jehovah is preparing his people for this massive education work that is going to take place in the new world.

01:18:38.460 --> 01:18:42.460
So now's the time for each one of us to think about that question.

01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:47.460
Are you there? Is your name in the book of life?

01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:56.460
Yes, may your name be found written in Jehovah's book of life and may it remain there forever.

01:18:56.460 --> 01:19:07.890
Oh, he sincerely thank you, Brother Jackson, for that very building and strengthening talk.

01:19:07.890 --> 01:19:19.890
I have to say, when the governing body discussed that information, all of us felt so heartwarming to think of the time

01:19:19.890 --> 01:19:26.890
when the anointed will really be able to work with people on the earth and help them come to perfection.

01:19:26.890 --> 01:19:30.890
What a wonderful, wonderful moment that will be.

01:19:30.890 --> 01:19:38.890
Well, now we're primed for an interesting discussion presented by another member of the governing body, Brother Kenneth Cook.

01:19:38.890 --> 01:19:42.890
His theme is, are you heating the warnings?

01:19:42.890 --> 01:19:52.699
We live in a time that will end in final judgment by means of God's kingdom.

01:19:52.699 --> 01:20:03.699
Jesus described this time when he gave his disciples a prophetic sign regarding his invisible presence at the conclusion of the system of things.

01:20:03.699 --> 01:20:11.699
Since his prophecy applies to our day, we should be very interested in its details.

01:20:11.699 --> 01:20:17.699
It also points to a bright future for those who heed its warnings.

01:20:17.699 --> 01:20:26.699
We find the prophecy in Matthew chapter 24 and 25, Mark chapter 13 and Luke chapter 21.

01:20:26.699 --> 01:20:35.699
After revealing many of the things that would occur, Jesus provided warnings for his disciples by means of three parables.

01:20:35.699 --> 01:20:49.699
First, he gave the parable of the virgins, then the parable of the talents, and finally the parable of the sheep and the goats.

01:20:49.699 --> 01:20:56.699
The parable will show how a person's behavior will affect his or her final judgment.

01:20:56.699 --> 01:21:06.699
The two parables apply to those, the first two, to those with a heavenly hope, and the third parable applies to those with an earthly hope.

01:21:06.699 --> 01:21:14.699
Yet no matter what our hope may be, all of us can learn from the warnings found in Jesus' parables.

01:21:14.699 --> 01:21:18.699
Let's start with the third parable.

01:21:18.699 --> 01:21:29.699
In the parable of the sheep and goats, Jesus described the final judgment for sheep-like ones and goat-like ones during the Great Tribulation.

01:21:29.699 --> 01:21:37.699
As Jehovah's-appointed judging king, Jesus will be completely righteous in the judgment that he gives.

01:21:37.699 --> 01:21:45.699
As a thorough judge, he is already observing the actions, attitudes, and speech of all people,

01:21:45.699 --> 01:21:50.699
including how they treat his anointed brothers.

01:21:50.699 --> 01:22:00.699
By the start of the Great Tribulation, Jesus will have identified those who are sheep-like or goat-like in their conduct and attitude.

01:22:00.699 --> 01:22:05.699
From that time onward, those who are goat-like will not seek to change.

01:22:05.699 --> 01:22:19.699
However, those who are sheep-like and who have the hope of living forever on earth will need to remain faithful in order for Jehovah to keep their names in the book of life.

01:22:19.699 --> 01:22:27.699
Then, just before Armageddon, God's Son will pass final judgment on all those then living here on earth.

01:22:27.699 --> 01:22:39.699
Persons who are judged to be righteous will enter into ever-lasting life on earth, what a marvelous reward for those who keep their integrity.

01:22:39.699 --> 01:22:49.699
Although Jesus' third parable applies to those who hope to live on the earth, anointed ones too must listen to the warning message found in that parable.

01:22:49.699 --> 01:23:01.699
How so? Because Jesus is observing their actions, attitudes, and speech as well, they too must prove to be righteous and faithful.

01:23:01.699 --> 01:23:05.699
Still, a few questions remain.

01:23:05.699 --> 01:23:14.699
For example, how are anointed Christians undergoing a period of judgment today? And what warnings did Jesus provide for them?

01:23:14.699 --> 01:23:22.699
We find the answers to both questions in the first two parables of Matthew chapter 25.

01:23:22.699 --> 01:23:34.699
To prepare us for this review, let's briefly consider how anointed Christians are chosen. We'll start by looking at a lesson from ancient times.

01:23:34.699 --> 01:23:46.699
When the priesthood was established in ancient Israel, Jehovah decided who would serve as high priest, as well as the underpriests at the tabernacle.

01:23:46.699 --> 01:24:00.699
Exodus 281 tells us that he selected Aaron along with his sons. No one could rightly question Jehovah's choice, and those chosen had to prove worthy of their calling.

01:24:00.699 --> 01:24:13.699
Similar to what he did back then, Jehovah chooses those who will serve as priests in heaven. He began by selecting Jesus to serve as high priest.

01:24:13.699 --> 01:24:29.699
Although Jesus was a perfect man, he did not choose that role for himself. We read at Hebrews 5 and verse 5 that the Christ did not glorify Himself by becoming a high priest.

01:24:30.699 --> 01:24:43.699
Likewise, those who will serve as priests in heaven do not choose themselves for this assignment. They are selected by Jehovah and anointed with His Holy Spirit.

01:24:43.699 --> 01:24:53.699
He knows each one whom He has anointed for this service. How do faithful anointed ones view their heavenly calling?

01:24:53.699 --> 01:25:05.699
When a person is anointed by God, he or she knows without doubt that it is from Jehovah, and that one accepts Jehovah's choice with gratitude.

01:25:05.699 --> 01:25:22.699
Instead of feeling proud or haughty, anointed ones strive to imitate Jesus' example of humility. They're helped to do so by keeping in mind the lessons and warnings that are found in Jesus' parables for them.

01:25:23.699 --> 01:25:37.699
It's not worthy that just before relating his parables, Jesus spoke about a faithful and discreet slave who would distribute spiritual food at the proper time during the last days.

01:25:38.699 --> 01:25:53.699
That slave pictures a small group of anointed Christian men today, the governing body. For their faithful service, Jesus said that there would be a reward, but he also provided a warning.

01:25:53.699 --> 01:26:04.699
He spoke about what would happen if that slave ever lost sight of Jesus' future return and started to mistreat his fellow slaves. If that were to happen,

01:26:04.699 --> 01:26:15.699
that slave would be viewed as evil, and would as Matthew 2451 states, be punished with the greatest severity.

01:26:15.699 --> 01:26:27.699
Please note that Jesus was not prophesying that there would be an evil slave. This is a warning, not a prophecy.

01:26:27.699 --> 01:26:38.699
What was the warning that the faithful slave needs to remain watchful? Yet it is not just the faithful and discreet slave who must remain watchful.

01:26:38.699 --> 01:26:53.699
By means of his parables, Jesus warned that all anointed ones must likewise prove to be discreet, faithful, and watchful. Now, how did Jesus make his point?

01:26:53.699 --> 01:27:11.699
In the parable of the virgins, Jesus spoke of ten virgins who went out to meet a bridegroom. They hoped to accompany the bridegroom into his marriage feast. Jesus described five of the virgins as discreet and five as foolish.

01:27:11.699 --> 01:27:22.699
The Greek word used for discreet conveys the idea of understanding, forethought, discernment, and wisdom in a practical sense.

01:27:22.699 --> 01:27:32.699
So, the discreet virgins were wise, and they showed this by being ready when the bridegroom arrived in the middle of the night.

01:27:32.699 --> 01:27:44.699
They had lamps to light their way, and Matthew 25 verse 4 adds that the discreet virgins took oil in their flasks along with their lamps.

01:27:44.699 --> 01:27:56.699
So, they had the means to keep their lamps burning. Because they proved to be ready, they could follow the bridegroom into his marriage feast.

01:27:56.699 --> 01:28:08.699
This action depicts genuine anointed ones entering into their heavenly reward. They will be judged as worthy to join the bridegroom Jesus in his heavenly kingdom.

01:28:08.699 --> 01:28:20.699
But what about the foolish virgins? Well, unlike the discreet virgins, the foolish ones were not ready when the bridegroom arrived. Their lamps died out.

01:28:20.699 --> 01:28:31.699
As a result, they could not follow the bridegroom and enter into his marriage feast. When they later tried to do so, they heard the bridegroom tell them,

01:28:31.699 --> 01:28:48.699
I do not know you. What is the lesson and warning that Jesus was illustrating? He was showing that only anointed Christians who keep on the watch and prove to be ready will follow him into the reward.

01:28:48.699 --> 01:28:59.699
Notice though, that Jesus did not say that there would be a large number of foolish ones who would be unprepared when he comes in this way at the great tribulation.

01:28:59.699 --> 01:29:09.699
Here too, this is a warning, not a prophecy. We're not focused on five of them being discreet and five of them being foolish.

01:29:10.699 --> 01:29:21.699
Jesus was simply letting anointed ones know what would happen if they failed to keep on the watch. That is a sobering thought.

01:29:21.699 --> 01:29:31.699
Whether our hope is heavenly or earthly, all true Christians should listen to the warning found in the parable of the virgins.

01:29:31.699 --> 01:29:39.699
We must keep on the watch and always be ready to carry out our service to God.

01:29:39.699 --> 01:29:50.699
Now after using the parable of the virgins to emphasize the need to be discreet, Jesus related a parable that highlights the need to be faithful.

01:29:50.699 --> 01:29:54.699
It is the parable of the talents or money.

01:29:55.699 --> 01:30:03.699
In this parable, Jesus tells about two slaves who were faithful to their master and one slave who was not.

01:30:03.699 --> 01:30:15.699
How did the two slaves prove to be faithful? Well, the faithful slaves worked hard to increase the money that their master entrusted to their care just before he traveled abroad.

01:30:16.699 --> 01:30:25.699
When he returned, the faithful slaves had more to give back than what they had received and they were blessed for doing so.

01:30:25.699 --> 01:30:32.699
But what about the third slave, the sluggish one? What did he do with what he had received?

01:30:32.699 --> 01:30:38.699
While the sluggish slave buried what he had been given and failed to increase his master's talents.

01:30:38.699 --> 01:30:48.699
When the master returned, that slave had nothing additional to give to his master. He even tried to blame the master calling him a demanding man.

01:30:48.699 --> 01:30:59.699
As a result, that slave did not receive greater blessings. More than that, what he had been given was taken away from him.

01:30:59.699 --> 01:31:03.699
And he was cast out of the master's household.

01:31:03.699 --> 01:31:11.699
What did the master's response mean for each of his slaves and whom do they picture today?

01:31:11.699 --> 01:31:19.699
The two faithful slaves depict anointed Christians who proved to be valued members of the master's household.

01:31:20.699 --> 01:31:30.699
The master, Jesus, invites them to enter into the joy of their master. That joy pictures their heavenly reward.

01:31:30.699 --> 01:31:39.699
On the other hand, the bad example of the sluggish slave provides a warning for anointed ones. How so?

01:31:39.699 --> 01:31:48.699
If anointed ones do not remain alert and watchful, they could become self-satisfied with what they have received.

01:31:48.699 --> 01:31:52.699
They might not extend themselves in kingdom service.

01:31:52.699 --> 01:32:05.699
They could lose sight of their responsibilities and fail to do a second Peter 1 verse 10 urges where they are told to make the calling and choosing sure for themselves.

01:32:05.699 --> 01:32:15.699
If any of them become like the sluggish slave, they would not be approved to enter into the heavenly kingdom and share in the joy of the master.

01:32:16.699 --> 01:32:30.699
Once again, Jesus was providing a warning, not a prophecy. Clearly, all anointed Christians must strive to be both discreet and faithful.

01:32:30.699 --> 01:32:42.699
Whether our hope is heavenly or earthly, all true Christians are determined to remain faithful to Jehovah. We are secure in our relationship with him.

01:32:42.699 --> 01:32:48.699
We are not concerned if Jehovah chooses to anoint some faithful ones in more recent years.

01:32:48.699 --> 01:32:59.699
We recall what Jesus said regarding the eleventh hour workers in his illustration about the vineyard. You can read about it in Matthew chapter 20.

01:32:59.699 --> 01:33:11.699
Those who were invited to work in the vineyard later in the day received the same reward from the master of the vineyard as those who were invited to work in it earlier in the day.

01:33:12.699 --> 01:33:23.699
Likewise, Jehovah and his son know how many anointed ones to call in order to complete the number of 144,000 before the end comes.

01:33:23.699 --> 01:33:32.699
But no matter when they are selected, each anointed one who is judged to be faithful will receive the heavenly reward.

01:33:32.699 --> 01:33:40.699
Now with that in mind, let's consider Matthew chapter 24 and verses 40 and 41.

01:33:40.699 --> 01:33:46.699
And as we do, we'll see how these verses connect to Jesus' parables for the anointed.

01:33:46.699 --> 01:33:50.699
Matthew 24 verse 40, it reads,

01:33:50.699 --> 01:33:57.699
then two men will be in the field. One will be taken along and the other abandoned.

01:33:57.699 --> 01:34:07.270
Two women will be grinding at the hand mill. One will be taken along and the other abandoned.

01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:10.270
Did you notice some similarities to the parables?

01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:21.270
Jesus spoke of two men working in a field and of two women working at a hand mill. Outwardly, they appear to be the same.

01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:28.270
But in each case, Jesus said that one would be taken along and the other abandoned.

01:34:28.270 --> 01:34:37.270
He then urged his followers to keep on the watch, therefore, because you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.

01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:43.270
Jesus said something very similar after relating the parable of the virgins.

01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:47.270
In both examples, he provided a warning.

01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:52.270
Since the parable of the virgins applies to anointed Christians,

01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:57.270
do Jesus' comments about those who are taken along also apply to the anointed?

01:34:57.270 --> 01:35:04.270
It appears that they do. And here again, Jesus was providing a warning.

01:35:04.270 --> 01:35:08.270
In his great prophecy regarding the conclusion of the system of things,

01:35:08.270 --> 01:35:14.270
we find that Jesus lovingly highlights both the good news of the kingdom,

01:35:14.270 --> 01:35:19.270
as well as warning messages for all people, including his followers.

01:35:19.270 --> 01:35:24.270
Down to this day, our message follows the same pattern.

01:35:24.270 --> 01:35:29.270
It is both one of salvation, as well as one of warning.

01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:34.270
And we must continue to do all that we can to deliver Jesus' twofold message

01:35:34.270 --> 01:35:38.270
and help others to act on it while there is still time.

01:35:38.270 --> 01:35:47.270
Clearly, Jehovah and his Son want us to remain discreet, faithful, and on the watch.

01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:50.270
So what have we considered?

01:35:50.270 --> 01:35:55.270
Some of the virgins in Jesus' illustration found out that the door was shut

01:35:55.270 --> 01:36:00.270
and they heard the bridegroom tell them, I do not know you.

01:36:00.270 --> 01:36:05.270
One of the slaves in Jesus' illustration of the talents did not enter into his master's joy,

01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:09.270
but was thrown outside into the darkness.

01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:16.270
Jesus also indicated that not all would be taken along into the heavenly reward.

01:36:16.270 --> 01:36:20.270
What a serious warning for those who have the heavenly hope.

01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:27.270
Even so, we are confident that the full number of them will be filled.

01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:33.270
Truly, this is a time of judgment for all of God's people, including the righteous sheep

01:36:33.270 --> 01:36:36.270
who yearn to live forever on earth.

01:36:36.270 --> 01:36:42.270
But there is no reason for any of us to fear the final judgment that is yet ahead.

01:36:42.270 --> 01:36:48.270
Our loving heavenly Father promises to give us power beyond what is normal,

01:36:48.270 --> 01:36:58.270
so that we may, as Luke 21 verse 36 says, succeed in standing before the Son of Man.

01:36:58.270 --> 01:37:07.270
So then, whether our hope is heavenly or earthly, we must heed the warnings found in Jesus' parables

01:37:07.270 --> 01:37:18.420
and thereby keep our names written in the Book of Life.

01:37:18.420 --> 01:37:25.420
Thank you so much, Brother Cook, for that excellent review of warnings that we need to keep in our minds.

01:37:25.420 --> 01:37:31.420
Well, did you capture all of the fine points on those three talks?

01:37:31.420 --> 01:37:35.420
We're now going to pass out the exam sheets.

01:37:35.420 --> 01:37:37.420
Not just kidding.

01:37:37.420 --> 01:37:44.420
But if you would like to review those talks carefully and we know you will, guess what?

01:37:44.420 --> 01:37:51.420
They are going to be presented to the Worldwide Brotherhood in the January monthly edition of JW Broadcasting.

01:37:51.420 --> 01:38:01.420
So you all will have the opportunity to carefully review your notes to make sure you got all the fine points in those wonderful, wonderful talks.

01:38:01.420 --> 01:38:08.420
Well, the governing body has asked that a brief update about the construction of the Ram Mapo Headquarters facility

01:38:08.420 --> 01:38:10.420
be shared with you at this time.

01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:17.420
Now, despite the pandemic, we have clearly seen Jehovah's Hand on the Ram Mapo project this year.

01:38:17.420 --> 01:38:21.420
So please enjoy the following visual update.

01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:35.710
Before the main project begins, contractors have already been assisting to repair and strengthen an existing stone-faced bridge on the road into the site.

01:38:35.710 --> 01:38:42.710
When completed, the restoration of this structure will serve as a beautiful feature of the property.

01:38:43.710 --> 01:38:51.710
More important, Jehovah has greatly blessed the efforts to work through the planning process with the town of Ram Mapo.

01:38:51.710 --> 01:39:01.710
That process is now in the final stages of obtaining the necessary permits to start the large new construction project.

01:39:02.710 --> 01:39:19.710
In the first quarter of 2022, Jehovah Willie, contractors will start clearing the site in preparation for earth-moving, installation of underground utilities, and readying the locations where the first buildings will be constructed.

01:39:20.710 --> 01:39:35.710
This in itself will take many months, and we look to Jehovah to bless this key phase that, when concluded, will open up the project for many volunteers to come and share in the work.

01:39:35.710 --> 01:39:48.710
Much forethought and work has gone into the arrangements needed for feeding, housing, and providing temporary office spaces for all such willing brothers and sisters.

01:39:48.710 --> 01:39:59.710
The design team is fully engaged in preparing the construction documents. The drawings for some buildings are well advanced. Others are in the concept stage.

01:39:59.710 --> 01:40:15.729
No doubt, seeing these concept images of the future Ram Mapo facility is exciting and encouraging to all of you.

01:40:15.729 --> 01:40:24.729
Well, with all of you, we continue to pray that Jehovah will bless this very exciting theocratic project.

01:40:24.729 --> 01:40:35.729
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have felt Jehovah's loving care as we've received helpful direction just at the right time.

01:40:35.729 --> 01:40:49.729
Please listen and watch, as those who work in the coordinators' committee office recount how events unfolded with the pandemic and how Jehovah has guided matters throughout this time.

01:40:49.729 --> 01:40:59.640
In January of 2020, we started seeing news reports about a disease outbreak in Wuhan, China.

01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:09.640
Now at the time, it seemed localized and was not a global concern. But a short time later, the numbers were going up as the virus began to spread.

01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:13.640
Borders were closing, and airports were shutting down.

01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:27.310
On January 22nd, the coordinators' committee received their first letter from a branch about the coronavirus. The letter was from the Korea branch.

01:41:27.310 --> 01:41:35.310
Soon after that, we wrote to all branches in and around Asia, and included guidelines on what to do if they had an outbreak in their territory.

01:41:35.310 --> 01:41:46.310
We had dealt with local epidemics before, but nothing like this on a worldwide scale. It was clear that the virus is going to affect almost every aspect of our theocratic operations.

01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:53.310
And during those first few months of 2020, the organization would be faced with a huge amount of decisions.

01:41:53.310 --> 01:42:03.310
You have to realize that this was catching us right in the middle of our activities. Our schedule for the whole year had already been planned.

01:42:03.310 --> 01:42:17.310
We had shepherding visits to branches, regional conventions, even special conventions, and now we had Gilead graduation and memorial coming up right in front of us. What were we going to do?

01:42:17.310 --> 01:42:29.310
One of the first things the governing body decided was that the coordinators' committee would become the central channel of communication regarding COVID-19.

01:42:29.310 --> 01:42:46.310
Meanwhile, the graduation of the 148th class of Gilead was in two weeks. Should we have guests come? Should there be a live audience? There was not much time to make these decisions.

01:42:47.310 --> 01:43:03.310
However, after prayer and discussion, the entire governing body decided not to have a live audience for the Gilead graduation that weekend. That was unheard of.

01:43:03.310 --> 01:43:08.310
The next thing we needed to figure out was whether to lock down headquarters at Bethel.

01:43:08.310 --> 01:43:17.310
I clearly remember it was a Friday night, March 13th. We were getting reports of COVID cases in the congregations around Bethel.

01:43:17.310 --> 01:43:27.310
And we also knew that the Bethelites would be going out to their congregation and other activities over the weekend. If we were going to do something, we needed to do it quickly.

01:43:27.310 --> 01:43:39.310
We called each member of the governing body and explained the situation and all were unanimous that we should lock down Bethel immediately.

01:43:39.310 --> 01:43:49.310
So within the hour, a message went to the entire headquarters in the United States Bethel family to stay in. And if you were out to return to Bethel immediately.

01:43:49.310 --> 01:44:03.310
Some time later, we learned that there were some COVID cases at Patterson. If we had moved ahead potentially, we could have spread COVID through the whole Bethel family.

01:44:03.310 --> 01:44:08.310
We really felt Jehovah's protective hand.

01:44:08.310 --> 01:44:23.310
The same weekend as the Gilead graduation, the memorial invitation campaign was scheduled to begin. And so branches were asking, is it safe to go door to door and to distribute invitations? What if we can't meet in our kingdom halls?

01:44:23.310 --> 01:44:37.310
As the virus had spread in many countries, it became evident that we needed to suspend the public ministry. This was a very serious decision.

01:44:37.310 --> 01:44:52.310
But when we prayerfully analyzed the situation, we realized we would not be showing respect for the sanctity of life or love of neighbor if we continued house to house.

01:44:52.310 --> 01:45:02.310
Our preaching work shifted to letter writing and telephone witnessing. And what a huge witness has been given in this way.

01:45:02.310 --> 01:45:17.310
It was amazing to me personally when I saw how quickly the brothers could adapt to using Zoom, phone witnessing, letter writing. And instead of it being a huge setback for the work, it was almost as though the work even moved ahead.

01:45:17.310 --> 01:45:23.310
We were also having to deal with what to do about our kingdom halls and our meetings.

01:45:23.310 --> 01:45:31.310
Initially, some of the brothers were thinking, maybe we could just simply watch the pre-recorded meetings on JW Stream.

01:45:31.310 --> 01:45:50.310
Well, while that's an excellent provision, if we were going to do this for a long time, it would be wonderful to use a tool that would allow the brothers and sisters to come together virtually to be able to interact and have that interchange of encouragement.

01:45:50.310 --> 01:46:03.310
We knew that a few branches had already started using Zoom for congregation meetings. And we wondered, could this tool be used for congregation meetings globally?

01:46:03.310 --> 01:46:15.310
So we asked those branches for their recommendations on how we could use this tool further. We got their comments, we did some testing, and then the governing body approved the global use of Zoom for meetings.

01:46:15.310 --> 01:46:21.310
At the same time though, the coordinators committee urgently wanted to help those congregations to arrange dignified Zoom meetings.

01:46:21.310 --> 01:46:27.310
And so within a week, technical and theocratic guidelines were released to all congregations.

01:46:27.310 --> 01:46:36.310
Then shortly after that, tens of thousands of Zoom licenses were purchased and then provided to many congregations as part of the disaster relief arrangement.

01:46:36.310 --> 01:46:41.310
However, not all publishers could use Zoom due to lack of internet.

01:46:41.310 --> 01:46:49.310
So in the days leading up to the campaign, the governing body provided direction to all branches on how to handle those exact situations.

01:46:49.310 --> 01:46:55.310
They also announced that the memorial talk itself would be made available on JW.org.

01:46:55.310 --> 01:47:04.310
So one branch wrote in and asked if they could use television and radio broadcasting. And we thought, that's a good idea. Let's try it.

01:47:04.310 --> 01:47:14.310
Once we saw how well it worked in that country, television and radio were approved for all branches in Africa only two days before the memorial.

01:47:14.310 --> 01:47:27.310
How thrilling it was for many friends in Africa to find out even moments before the broadcast began that they would be able to commemorate the memorial simultaneously with their brothers and sisters throughout the country.

01:47:28.310 --> 01:47:34.310
To have the memorial without being able to meet together was so different for all of us.

01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:48.310
Can you imagine for the 2021 memorial, there was an all-time peak of 21,367,603.

01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:54.310
Clearly, we have seen Jehovah's blessing on these arrangements.

01:47:55.310 --> 01:48:04.310
While all these new arrangements were being made at a rapid pace, the usual work of the coordinators committee office didn't stop because of the pandemic.

01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:13.310
We still had to deal with the King of the North, persecuting our brothers. We still had disasters and many other things to contend with.

01:48:13.310 --> 01:48:22.310
In fact, we handled twice as many disasters in the 2020 service year in the middle of the pandemic than we did in 2018.

01:48:23.310 --> 01:48:28.310
On a daily basis, we saw clear evidence that we are living in the last days.

01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:38.310
We had to come up with guidelines to help branches determine what aspects of relief work could be postponed and at the same time ensure that urgent or necessary work went ahead safely.

01:48:38.310 --> 01:48:50.310
While there's no doubt that the pandemic complicated disaster relief efforts considerably, it was so faith strengthening to see that the governing body refused to allow those complications to prevent them from caring for our brothers.

01:48:50.310 --> 01:48:59.310
In addition to the impact these disasters had on our brothers, in some countries our brothers couldn't even get enough food for their daily needs.

01:48:59.310 --> 01:49:08.310
This could have been because of government restrictions, supply issues, or other circumstances that wouldn't allow the brothers to work.

01:49:08.310 --> 01:49:13.310
Literally, the branches had to arrange to provide their daily bread.

01:49:13.310 --> 01:49:20.310
Branches were encouraged to establish disaster relief committees to care for the needs on a local level.

01:49:20.310 --> 01:49:29.310
Reminders were provided to help families try to prepare a reserve of food if at all possible in case the situation became worse.

01:49:29.310 --> 01:49:39.310
Of course, the virus affected not only our meetings at the Kingdom Hall, but also our circuit assemblies, regional conventions, and special conventions.

01:49:39.310 --> 01:49:49.310
So the governing body decided to cancel all live regional and special conventions for 2020.

01:49:49.310 --> 01:50:00.720
That led to a landmark convention program on JW.org that the entire brotherhood enjoyed.

01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:11.720
That same week in March, we approved that a JW broadcasting news release about the coronavirus outbreak be developed.

01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:24.720
So interviews and scripts were prepared during that Gilead graduation weekend, and the program was recorded and released the following week.

01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:35.720
The governing body updates have been an important way for us to shepherd the entire organization during the pandemic.

01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:39.720
Well, once vaccinations became more prevalent, we faced another challenge.

01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:45.720
The United States branch was struggling to get vaccines for those in the Bethel family who wanted them.

01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:56.720
So in early April 2021, we called together a meeting. We had all the key individuals there from the various departments, and everyone was given an assignment.

01:50:56.720 --> 01:51:06.720
And within two weeks, we had enough vaccine to vaccinate everyone in the U.S. Bethel family who chose to be vaccinated.

01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:14.720
Well, about a week later, we sent a letter to all branches encouraging them to investigate the availability of vaccines for special full-time servants.

01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:21.720
We were especially concerned about special full-time servants serving in lands where the government was not yet making vaccines available.

01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:33.720
After that direction went out, we had a tremendous response from a number of branches who were able to obtain vaccines for special full-time servants who wanted to receive them.

01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:40.720
Several branches said that it had seemed impossible to get vaccines in their country at that moment.

01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:53.720
But they prayed about it, they followed the direction, and then either that same day or the very next day, Jehovah opened the doors, and suddenly they had the vaccine.

01:51:53.720 --> 01:52:07.720
All of these events occurred rapidly, and even though it was difficult to make so many adjustments in such a short period of time, we could see Jehovah's hand in the governing body's decisions.

01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:13.720
Television, radio, video conferencing have all served our brothers well.

01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:20.720
With just goes to show that Jehovah was guiding the governing body as they made these decisions so early in the pandemic.

01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:36.720
You know, we've always appreciated the direction we received from the faithful slave, but at that unique time, especially, it was so encouraging to see Jehovah use them to make these major decisions, and they made many that one week in March.

01:52:36.720 --> 01:52:47.720
Although there have been many challenges and sad times during the pandemic, it's been amazing to see many positive developments.

01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:55.720
So many inactive ones have returned. So many Bible studies have been started.

01:52:55.720 --> 01:53:12.720
We saw how Jehovah guided us through, decision by decision, step by step, and seeing how Jehovah led us through this situation has helped me to see that regardless of what is going to come up in the future, Jehovah is going to do the same thing.

01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:21.720
Like scripture say, we get our plagues. Yeah, those times, but overall, when you're in Jehovah's arms, what's the worry?

01:53:21.720 --> 01:53:41.720
You could say every one of the governing bodies faith was strengthened as we got through this trial, and it's just a continuous thing of our faith being built up and how Jehovah is directing us, and he's preparing his people for life in that new world. The real life is coming.

01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:59.720
It's been a real privilege to see Jehovah spirit in action during this pandemic. It's strengthened our faith to see him use the governing body to provide scripturally based direction, keep the kingdom work going, and all the while showing respect for life.

01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:15.720
As a result, our trust in Jehovah's organization is stronger than ever before, and building this trust now is vital because Jehovah is preparing us for future events, including the Great Tribulation.

01:54:15.720 --> 01:54:31.310
Well, we take this opportunity to thank all of the brothers who work in the coordinators committee office for the hard work that they put forward during the pandemic.

01:54:31.310 --> 01:54:40.310
It was just amazing to see how many ways Jehovah has directed matters during these challenging times.

01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:52.310
What an encouraging program, and that was just the first half, there's so much more to enjoy. We'll see you here next month for the rest of the program.

01:54:52.310 --> 01:55:00.310
But before we go, we'd like to meet our brothers and sisters in the Philippines in this month's video postcard.

01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:23.310
The Philippines is a tropical country in the western Pacific Ocean that's made up of more than 7,100 islands. Across those islands, you'll find an astonishing diversity of landscapes from pristine beaches and lush farmlands to dramatic mountain ranges.

01:55:23.310 --> 01:55:32.310
There are also bustling cities, including the capital, Manila, one of the most densely populated cities in the world.

01:55:32.310 --> 01:55:43.310
The over 230,000 publishers living in the Philippines preached to a population of more than 109 million people.

01:55:43.310 --> 01:55:56.310
In 2021, 739,439 attended the memorial. That's more than three times the number of publishers.

01:55:56.310 --> 01:56:03.310
Let's travel to the southern part of the country to one of the largest islands, Mindanao.

01:56:03.310 --> 01:56:18.310
Here, farmers grow staples like corn and rice, along with cacao, pomello, and durian, a popular Asian fruit famous for its unusual, pungent smell.

01:56:18.310 --> 01:56:26.310
The southern tip of Mindanao is home to the 97 publishers in the Margus congregation.

01:56:26.310 --> 01:56:32.310
In this remote part of the country, the pandemic posed some unique challenges.

01:56:32.310 --> 01:56:44.310
Because of unreliable internet service, the congregation chose to schedule its meetings on Zoom at 3.30am. Why so early?

01:56:44.310 --> 01:56:50.310
The internet signal is more stable during those early hours of the morning.

01:56:50.310 --> 01:57:00.310
The publishers may have missed out on a few hours of sleep, but they didn't miss any of the spiritual food being provided through the meetings.

01:57:00.310 --> 01:57:11.310
In other areas served by the congregation, there is no internet or cell service at all. So the brothers listen to meetings broadcast over radio.

01:57:11.310 --> 01:57:21.310
But those challenges haven't dampened their zeal, especially when it comes to sharing the good news with the indigenous population.

01:57:21.310 --> 01:57:28.310
Since 2019, the congregation has been hosting a Blan language group.

01:57:28.310 --> 01:57:35.310
Blan is an indigenous language spoken by about 125,000 people.

01:57:35.310 --> 01:57:42.310
The Blan people are famous for their handicrafts and colorful native costumes.

01:57:42.310 --> 01:57:52.310
With several publications and videos now available in Blan, native speakers can hear the truth in their own language.

01:57:52.310 --> 01:58:02.310
The 28 brothers and sisters of the Blan group in the Margus congregation would like to send you their warm love and greetings.

01:58:03.310 --> 01:58:10.310
And please remember, dear brothers and sisters, we love you all very much.

01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:17.310
From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
