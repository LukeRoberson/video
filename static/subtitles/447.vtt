00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:10.039
Our focus in the Watchtower study article is on how we can unleash the power of God's word when teaching from the platform.

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:24.039
But you know whether we're teaching in a congregation setting on a Bible study or in the family, isn't it true that all of us, brothers and sisters, need to pay constant attention to ourselves and to our teaching?

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:34.039
And we know why that's so important because lives are at stake, and all of us, younger or older, touch the lives of other people.

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:44.039
So when we teach effectively, we are giving opportunity to others to detain the wisdom and the discernment that God's word can give them.

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:51.039
That's why we need to approach any teaching opportunity seriously and prayerfully.

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:59.039
You know, over 20 years ago, a kind elder gave me some constructive counsel after a public talk, and then with a warm smile, he said this,

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.040
remember, none of us teach like Jesus did.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.040
Well, I'll never forget that counsel. Why were those observations so helpful?

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:19.040
Well, it reminded me that when teaching our model needs to be Jesus, the great teacher, there's more to learn from him.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:29.040
And Jesus example reminds us of the need to remain humble and diligent students of Jehovah, the grand instructor.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:41.040
Though all of us are teachers on occasion, isn't it true that most often the role we play during spiritual programs is that of students?

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:55.040
Just for a moment, think about the many hours we spend as students, not teachers, when we're in the audience at congregation meetings, at assemblies and conventions.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:06.040
Add to that the time we are students when we buy out time to watch the monthly broadcast, to prepare for meetings, to engage in family and personal study.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:14.039
And then think of the added privilege that many of us here have to enjoy morning worship five days a week.

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:19.039
You know, a typical program of morning worship lasts between 20 to 25 minutes.

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:32.039
If you multiply that by five days a week and then by 52 weeks, at a minimum, we are exposed to at least 86 hours of divine instruction each year.

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:42.039
But if we're not careful, some or much of that valuable instruction, encouragement and counsel could just wash over us.

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:52.039
So for the remaining time for our program this morning, let's consider some things all of us can do to listen more effectively at spiritual programs.

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:58.039
Please, for our first point, open your Bible to Ezra chapter 7 and verse 10.

00:02:58.039 --> 00:03:01.039
And let's consider Ezra's example.

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:06.039
Let's Ezra chapter 7 and verse 10.

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:08.039
And notice the reading carefully.

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:21.039
Ezra had prepared his heart to consult the law of Jehovah and to practice it and to teach its regulations and judgments in Israel.

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:34.039
Now, if you have the Bible with the asterisk next to prepared his heart, if you tap on that, you'll notice that that could be rendered as had determined in his heart.

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:36.039
Well, what do we learn from Ezra?

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:40.039
He had the right attitude going in to a period of study.

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:44.039
He had the right approach to study and learning.

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:49.039
He recognized that it was Jehovah who would be teaching him through his law.

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:58.039
And as the verse goes on to say, he first recognized that he needed to personally practice what he was learning.

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:04.039
Only then would he be in a rightful position to effectively teach others.

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:08.039
Well, this scripture emphasizes the point we've already made, doesn't it?

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:16.040
Though we are teachers on occasion, we are always first and foremost students of God's Word.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:31.040
How can we imitate Ezra's example and prepare our hearts before study, before attending a spiritual program, whether here at Bethel or in the congregation, before watching a monthly broadcast?

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:40.040
Well, we need to prepare our hearts by specifically praying to Jehovah recognizing him as the source of the teaching.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.040
What should we pray specifically about?

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:51.040
Well, for one, we want to pray that we remain humble while listening to theocratic instruction.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:05:01.040
We need to listen no matter how long we've been in Jehovah's classroom, because none of us knows it all, nor will we ever know it all.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:09.040
Proverbs chapter 1 and verse 5 reminds us that a wise person listens and takes in more instruction.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.040
This leads to another question.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:20.040
What if we find we have a somewhat negative attitude toward a certain presentation, perhaps the material doesn't interest us?

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:26.040
Or we have a negative attitude toward a certain brother and his teaching ability?

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.040
What should we do?

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.040
Prepare our heart.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:37.040
Pray to Jehovah to recognize and appreciate that the instruction is from him.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.040
Pray to have a thankful spirit.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:49.040
You know, back in 2002, the watchtower made this helpful point in an article that was entitled, pay more than the usual attention, I quote.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:55.040
Some may tend to gauge the quality of a meeting by the teaching abilities of the participants.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:02.040
Though the teaching ability of participants is important, it is not the soul factor contributing to a meeting's success.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:12.040
Do you not agree that our prime concern should be not how well the speaker delivers his talk, but how well we incline our ear?

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:21.040
When we attend meetings, the article continues, and pay attention to what is being presented, we are worshiping God in harmony with his will.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.040
That is what makes the meeting a success.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:32.040
If we are eager to take in the knowledge of God, we will benefit from meetings regardless of a speaker's abilities.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.040
What a beautiful reminder for all of us.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:49.040
So our first point, like Ezra, let's prepare our hearts with prayer as students who are determined to always accept and apply what Jehovah has to teach us.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.040
Let's consider a second point.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.040
The need to focus our attention.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.040
Have you faced the challenge of staying focused during spiritual programs?

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:05.040
Our minds may be distracted with anxieties and many other things.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.040
Noise and movements around us could distract us.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:19.040
If we are watching morning worship at a location other than the Bethel dining room, likely we well know the numerous distractions that fight for our attention.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:25.040
Some of us have ailments and physical discomforts that may make it difficult to concentrate.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:33.040
Recently, a sister in our congregation told us about her long-term battle with migraine headaches.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:39.040
I tried to put myself in her shoes having a migraine headache while attending a spiritual program.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.040
Difficult to concentrate.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:47.040
Well, whatever the case may be, we know we admit that there are many challenges and distractions.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.040
What can we do about it?

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:57.040
Well, since the eyes strongly influence where we focus our attention, the benefit book provides this suggestion.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:02.040
Use your eyes to help you concentrate by keeping them on the speaker.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:07.040
When he cites a Bible text, even a familiar one, look it up and follow along as he reads it.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:14.040
And then it said this, resist the temptation to turn your head in the direction of every noise or movement.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:22.040
If the eyes are flooding your mind with distracting information, you will miss much of what is presented from the platform.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:27.040
And think about two now, the use of electronic devices.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:35.039
Have you ever been alerted, messaged, or emailed while looking at the Bible on your device?

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:43.039
How wise it is when we turn those devices into a mode that eliminates unnecessary distractions.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:46.039
What about anxieties or disquieting thoughts?

00:08:46.039 --> 00:08:49.039
What could we do about that?

00:08:49.039 --> 00:08:59.039
Well, here, again, is where we're remembering who the grand instructor is and how close he can be to us when we're in a teaching environment.

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:02.039
Open, please, your Bible to Psalm 94 and 19.

00:09:02.039 --> 00:09:06.039
To recall what the psalmist said to Jehovah.

00:09:06.039 --> 00:09:13.899
Psalm 94 and verse 19, we read,

00:09:13.899 --> 00:09:20.899
When anxieties overwhelm me, you, Jehovah, comforted and soothed me.

00:09:20.899 --> 00:09:23.899
What a beautiful reminder.

00:09:23.899 --> 00:09:31.899
Jehovah can sooth and comfort us when attending spiritual programs so that we can focus on what he's teaching us.

00:09:31.899 --> 00:09:36.899
Yes, spiritual programs are a provision from him, a spiritual lifeline.

00:09:36.899 --> 00:09:42.899
So as needed, during a spiritual program, we should pray to Jehovah to help us stay focused.

00:09:42.899 --> 00:09:46.899
Pray repeatedly as needed.

00:09:46.899 --> 00:09:49.899
Well, in summary, what have we learned?

00:09:49.899 --> 00:09:52.899
All of us are teachers from time to time.

00:09:52.899 --> 00:09:59.899
But first and foremost, we are students in the classroom of the great teacher and the grand instructor.

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:07.899
Like Ezra, humility and appreciation should move us to prepare our hearts before every spiritual program.

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:12.899
We don't want to miss anything that Jehovah has for us.

00:10:12.899 --> 00:10:18.899
We're determined to consult that law so that we can practice it and then teach it.

00:10:18.899 --> 00:10:30.899
And in view of all the potential distractions, let's make it our aim to use our eyes, our mind and our heart to focus attention on the goodness of Jehovah's spiritual provisions.
