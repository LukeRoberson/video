00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:13.060
In today's world, there's a constant flood of information coming at you from just about everywhere.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.060
It's good to stay informed.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.059
The problem is that not everything you hear or see is true.

00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:23.059
Some of it is misinformation.

00:00:23.059 --> 00:00:31.059
Opinions, half-truths, conspiracy theories, and even outright lies dressed up as facts.

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:34.060
Misinformation isn't just inaccurate.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.060
It can also be dangerous.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:45.539
It can cause people to make bad decisions or to ignore important safety warnings.

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.539
So how can you protect yourself from misinformation?

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:58.539
At Job 12-11, the Bible says that we should test out words as the tongue tastes food.

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.539
When you taste something new, you can spit it out if it's bad.

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.540
Before you swallow it.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:12.540
In the same way, before you believe a story or repeat it to others, you should put it to the test.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.540
Here are two ways you can do that.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.540
Test number one.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.540
Consider the source of the information.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.540
Do you know where the information originally came from?

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.540
Don't be fooled by appearances.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:33.540
An online post may look official, but behind the scenes, the author may just be repeating rumors,

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.540
or spreading his own opinions.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.540
And with something called deep fake technology,

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.540
this on his people can even do things like swap the faces and voices in a video

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.540
to create a completely fake report.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.540
So even if a story is widely repeated, follow the Bible's advice of 1 Thessalonians 5-21.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.540
And make sure of all things.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.540
Compare what you hear with other sources to verify the information.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.540
Test number two.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.539
Consider the purpose of a story.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.539
Is it really to present the facts or to promote just one side of an issue?

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:24.539
Some reports spin the news, emphasizing certain details and downplaying others to sway your opinion.

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:28.539
Some reports may even be conspiracy theories.

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:33.539
Claims that certain groups have secretly plotted to cause a tragic event or crisis.

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:38.539
The purpose is often to promote prejudice and hatred.

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:42.539
Such theories have a way of spreading like wildfire.

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:44.539
But they are just that.

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:45.539
Theories.

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:49.539
And sometimes they're based on deliberate lies.

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:51.539
So don't be fooled.

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:55.539
But before you spend time and effort testing everything you hear,

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:59.539
there's an important question you need to ask yourself.

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:03.539
Is the story really that important to you?

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:08.539
Blashy headlines can make even trivial news items seem important.

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:11.539
But if you follow every bit of information that pops up,

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:14.539
you just may hit information overload.

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:19.539
We'll get stressed out about reports that are more speculation than actual news.

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:24.539
If you feel overwhelmed, it may help to turn off some notifications

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:29.539
and just search for the information you need when you need it.

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:35.539
Of course, even if you're not online, misinformation can spread by word of mouth.

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:43.539
Even while meaning friends may just repeat what they've heard.

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:47.539
So whether you read something, hear it from another person,

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:49.539
or it's forwarded to you by a friend.

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:53.539
Remember the words of Proverbs 14-15.

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:57.539
The naive person believes every word.

00:03:57.539 --> 00:04:00.539
But the shrewd one ponders each step.

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:06.539
In other words, don't just believe everything you hear without thinking it through.

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:10.539
But that doesn't mean we can't trust anything or anyone.

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:14.539
If you hear something that makes you anxious or suspicious,

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:19.540
go to someone you trust, someone with more experience,

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.540
who can help you evaluate the truth behind it.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.540
By taking the time to evaluate information sources,

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.540
considering the purpose behind the reports you hear,

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.540
and not getting bogged down with news you don't really need,

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.540
you'll be well informed, instead of misinformed.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.540
And that will help you make good decisions and stay safe.
