00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:07.910
This month we're going to discuss the theme, Pray continually, so that you may not enter

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.390
into temptation.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:16.350
Those words of Jesus are recorded at Matthew 26 verse 41.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.949
In this discussion, we'll answer three important questions.

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:23.910
One, why did Jesus pray?

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.309
Two, what temptations did He face?

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:34.070
In three, what lessons can we learn from Jesus' example?

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.270
Let's start by reading that verse together.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.869
That's Matthew 26 and verse 41.

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:48.509
Keep on the watch and pray continually so that you may not enter into temptation.

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:54.590
The Spirit, of course, is eager or willing, but the flesh is weak.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.630
Why did Jesus pray?

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.909
He has uttered these words on the final night before His execution.

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:08.469
No doubt this was the most difficult evening that Jesus had ever faced.

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:15.790
The surrounding verses tell us that He began to feel grieved and to be greatly troubled.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:22.950
It's hard for us to comprehend fully the stress and pressure Jesus was facing on that night.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.829
He knew that Satan was about to throw everything He could at Him.

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:33.590
Jesus also knew that He'd soon die an agonizing death.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.510
But something else was even harder for Him to handle.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:45.629
He realized that He was about to be falsely charged and convicted of the despicable crime

00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:50.989
of blasphemy against Jehovah's holy name.

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:59.629
The study note on Matthew 26 verse 39 says, Jesus, no doubt felt great concern over the

00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:07.349
reproach that His death, as one charge with blasphemy and sedition, could bring on God,

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:13.310
moving Him to pray that this cup pass away from Him.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.469
In the face of all that pressure, would Jesus remain faithful until death?

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:23.830
The lives of countless people hung in the balance.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.949
Even more important, His Father's reputation was involved.

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:35.669
Under all that intense emotional stress, what did Jesus do?

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:41.069
He prayed not just once, but three times.

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:48.469
Not as how Luke describes what happened as recorded at Luke 22 and verse 44.

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:54.069
But He was in such agony that He kept praying more earnestly.

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.990
And His sweat became as drops of blood falling to the ground.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.310
What's the lesson for us?

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.270
Well, think about it.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.870
Jesus knew Satan well.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.030
Jesus had observed from heaven all the temptations that Satan uses in His efforts to ensnare

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.990
God's servants.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.270
Yet Jesus did not feel that He could easily handle whatever the temptome might place

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.389
before Him.

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:25.069
So this is a clear lesson for us.

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:31.030
If the perfect Son of God felt the need to pray for divine help and strength, how much

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.030
more so should we?

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.870
How appropriate then is the admonition, pray continually so that you may not enter into

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.550
temptation.

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:48.389
But what does it mean to enter into temptation?

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:52.830
The watchtower back in 1951 explained,

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:59.590
We ourselves, under Satan's influence, create the temptation by thinking how nice it

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.430
would be to do or have something contrary to God's will.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.750
And they're not dismissing the desire created by this improper thinking by considering

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.550
it more and more.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:18.949
In this way, we are drawn out and led to ignore God's counsel and warning.

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:23.620
We enter into temptation.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.899
Prayer helps us when we face temptation.

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:32.579
It helps us to focus on what your hover wants us to do and to ask Him for the strength

00:04:32.579 --> 00:04:35.939
not to enter into temptation.

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:37.980
Our second question.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.379
What temptations did Jesus face while here on earth?

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:47.740
You probably immediately think of the occasion shortly after Jesus' baptism when He was

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.060
tempted three times by the devil.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.379
Let's quickly summarize those three temptations.

00:04:54.379 --> 00:05:02.699
First, Jesus was asked to turn stones into bread at a time when He was extremely hungry.

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:06.860
Basically, Satan appealed to Jesus' desire for food.

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:15.459
However, Jesus immediately rejected the temptation to satisfy that desire in an inappropriate way.

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:21.939
Second, Satan challenged Jesus to throw himself off the temple battlement.

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:25.100
Jesus rejected this temptation as well.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.300
Why?

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:35.139
Because He knew that such a spectacular display would amount to a prideful testing of Jehovah.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:42.459
Finally, Satan offered Jesus all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:44.740
But at what price?

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:50.899
Satan demanded that Jesus offer Him in return an act of worship.

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:53.019
What was Jesus' answer?

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:58.500
He flatly refused saying, go away, Satan.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.540
Have you had to face similar temptations?

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:06.819
Or you might quickly answer, no one has asked me to turn stones into bread or to jump

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:11.779
off a tall building and certainly no one has offered me the rulership of all the governments

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:13.860
in the world.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.860
But notice please, we said similar, not the same.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.060
So have you faced similar temptations?

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.220
No doubt you have.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.180
Most of us have faced temptations involving fleshly desires.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:34.540
There may have been temptations to commit immorality or temptations that appeal to greed

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.980
or an unbalanced concern about material things.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:44.819
Other temptations may have appealed to our pride or tested our humility or our desire

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:47.540
to impress others.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:55.139
And who of us hasn't been tempted by opportunities offered to us by Satan's world for wealth, power,

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:57.620
or position?

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:04.899
No matter what temptation comes our way though, remember Jesus' words, pray continually

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:09.339
so that you may not enter into temptation.

00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:13.540
But were those the only temptations that Jesus faced?

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.699
No.

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:15.779
How do we know?

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:23.540
Well, notice Luke's words found at Luke chapter 4 and verse 13.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:31.180
So the devil, having finished all the temptation, departed from him until another convenient

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.339
time.

00:07:33.339 --> 00:07:37.199
Did Satan never come back again to tempt Jesus?

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:43.860
He must have, because of what we're told at Hebrews chapter 4 and verse 15.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.939
Let's read that.

00:07:46.939 --> 00:07:52.540
For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:58.500
But we have one who has been tested in all respects as we have.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.100
But without sin.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:06.300
Have you ever wondered what other convenient times Satan selected to test Jesus?

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:10.339
Well, let's consider some possibilities.

00:08:10.339 --> 00:08:18.300
One example occurred in 32 CE, about two and a half years after the initial temptations.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:23.939
Let's turn to John chapter 6 and verse 15.

00:08:23.939 --> 00:08:29.579
Then Jesus, knowing they were about to come and seize him to make him king, withdrew

00:08:29.579 --> 00:08:33.539
again to the mountain all alone.

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:39.139
This seems like a similar temptation to what Jesus had already faced.

00:08:39.139 --> 00:08:42.580
But this time the setting was different.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:46.139
Satan didn't directly offer the kingship to Jesus.

00:08:46.139 --> 00:08:50.259
There was no demand for Jesus to worship the devil.

00:08:50.259 --> 00:08:54.820
Rather those following Jesus wanted to make him their king.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:59.340
This temptation was going to be by popular demand.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.980
How did Jesus react?

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:07.179
Well, even before they could make their move, Jesus withdrew from them to a mountain, just

00:09:07.179 --> 00:09:09.379
by Himself.

00:09:09.379 --> 00:09:12.299
And what did He do on the mountain?

00:09:12.299 --> 00:09:20.330
We find the answer in a detail added in the parallel account recorded by Matthew.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:21.889
Let's read it together.

00:09:21.889 --> 00:09:26.809
It's Matthew 14 and verse 23.

00:09:26.809 --> 00:09:33.090
After sending the crowds away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray.

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:40.730
Yes, Jesus went there, not just to avoid the crowds, but to pray.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:42.529
The third question.

00:09:42.529 --> 00:09:47.049
What lesson can we learn from Jesus' example?

00:09:47.049 --> 00:09:53.090
Even though we may have passed the test or avoided entering into temptation in the past,

00:09:53.090 --> 00:10:00.210
we shouldn't be surprised if a similar temptation may arise again, but in a different form

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:05.409
or situation and at a convenient time, for whom?

00:10:05.409 --> 00:10:08.889
For Satan, not us.

00:10:08.889 --> 00:10:13.370
Another occasion occurred when Jesus and His apostles were in the vicinity of Mount

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:17.450
Hermann near Caesarea Philippine.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:23.769
Jesus' apostles had just acknowledged Him as the Christ, the Son of the Living God.

00:10:23.769 --> 00:10:28.330
So Jesus took the opportunity to expand their thinking further.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:34.850
Notice what's recorded, a Matthew chapter 16 and verse 21.

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:41.929
From that time forward, Jesus began explaining to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem

00:10:41.929 --> 00:10:48.929
and suffer many things from the elders, and chief priests, and scribes, and be killed,

00:10:48.929 --> 00:10:53.250
and on the third day be raised up.

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:57.330
What was the reaction of His apostles to this information?

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.649
Let's read on in verse 22.

00:11:00.649 --> 00:11:07.529
Let this Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, Be kind to yourself, Lord.

00:11:07.529 --> 00:11:11.009
You will not have this happened to you at all.

00:11:11.009 --> 00:11:16.809
Although these words were uttered by a close friend, Jesus immediately recognized that

00:11:16.809 --> 00:11:20.889
they reflected Satan's wishes, not Jehovah's.

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:25.289
So He firmly responded, Get behind me, Satan.

00:11:25.289 --> 00:11:33.570
You are a stumbling block to me because you think not God's thoughts, but those of men.

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:39.409
Although this account doesn't specifically refer to Jesus praying at that time, we know

00:11:39.409 --> 00:11:42.809
that Jesus was a man of prayer.

00:11:42.809 --> 00:11:49.190
The apostle Paul tells us at Hebrews 5.7 that during his life on earth Christ offered

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:56.470
up supplications and also petitions with strong outcries and tears.

00:11:56.470 --> 00:12:02.590
So no doubt those prayers helped Jesus to focus on the reason why He came to earth.

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:09.269
That clear focus helped him to see that Peter's misguided counsel would only help to further

00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:12.509
the temptus cause.

00:12:12.509 --> 00:12:14.909
What does this teach us?

00:12:14.909 --> 00:12:21.789
This shows us that temptations don't always come from those who are Jehovah's enemies.

00:12:21.789 --> 00:12:29.950
Some who are close to us may even serve Satan's ends unintentionally as was the case with Peter.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:38.070
He could be an employer, a workmate, a schoolmate, a friend, a relative, a parent, a brother,

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:41.230
or a marriagemate.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:45.830
Let's examine another example of how Satan returned to Jesus.

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:49.789
This time it was by means of the religious leaders.

00:12:49.789 --> 00:12:57.309
They attacked Jesus verbally, misquoting scripture, and hurling senseless accusations at him.

00:12:57.309 --> 00:13:03.029
But Jesus understood what they were up to, and frankly told them, you are from your father

00:13:03.029 --> 00:13:05.429
the devil.

00:13:05.429 --> 00:13:12.350
We shouldn't be surprised if apostates and other opposes use similar tactics today.

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:19.070
Just as Jesus was accused of blasphemy and political sedition, so two God's people have

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:26.629
been labeled as extremists and have been the victims of all sorts of false accusations.

00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:32.309
Like Jesus, we remember who really is behind all these attacks.

00:13:32.309 --> 00:13:35.830
Satan, the great tempter.

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:41.789
What will help us to avoid the temptation of giving up because of discouragement?

00:13:41.789 --> 00:13:47.269
How can we successfully handle all these types of attacks?

00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:51.169
Paul tells us what to do.

00:13:51.169 --> 00:13:59.289
We read at Ephesians 6 and verse 11, put on the complete suit of armor from God so that

00:13:59.289 --> 00:14:05.529
you may be able to stand firm against the crafty axe of the devil.

00:14:05.529 --> 00:14:10.649
After speaking about the importance of putting on the spiritual suit of armor, Paul goes

00:14:10.649 --> 00:14:17.529
on to say at verse 18 that this should be done together with every form of prayer and

00:14:17.529 --> 00:14:25.289
supplication as we carry on prayer on every occasion in spirit.

00:14:25.289 --> 00:14:28.490
So what have we learned from our discussion?

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:35.409
He seems that Satan didn't try again to tempt Jesus directly, but he was persistent.

00:14:35.409 --> 00:14:38.850
He kept coming back in different guises.

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:45.169
He used others to give Jesus wrong advice to oppose and ridicule him as well as to try

00:14:45.169 --> 00:14:48.090
to make him a king.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:54.929
Perhaps we've rejected some serious temptations in the past, but remember, Satan doesn't give

00:14:55.009 --> 00:14:58.929
up on us just because he failed in the past.

00:14:58.929 --> 00:15:06.250
At a time convenient to him, he may come back to tempt us with something completely different

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:12.289
or the same temptation dressed up in a different form.

00:15:12.289 --> 00:15:16.809
So what's the key to not entering into temptation?

00:15:16.809 --> 00:15:22.049
We need to remember and apply Jesus' admonition.

00:15:22.049 --> 00:15:26.370
Pray continually so that you may not enter into temptation.
