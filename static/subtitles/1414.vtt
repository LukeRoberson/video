00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:06.330
Hi, I am Hakot. Welcome to Iron Sharpen's Iron.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:26.530
Being an effective minister means being familiar with our message and the tools we use to share it.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.530
One of those tools is JW Library.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:36.530
It allows us to download, organize and study our publications.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.780
I've got tons of notes with gems from personal study.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.780
Another tool is JW.org.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:56.780
It's special because of a powerful search engine and the ability to easily switch languages.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.780
It's the first place many interested people search for more information.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.379
These features make it an invaluable tool for our ministry.

00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:13.379
But how can it make us better?

00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:15.379
Let's see in this demonstration.

00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:26.439
It's everything okay?

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.439
Sorry.

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.439
Did you just remind me of my dad?

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:40.750
No need to be sorry. Do you want to talk about it?

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.750
The smallest things remind me that he's not here.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.750
One moment, I'm fine. The next in tears.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.019
There's something that helps me when I get overwhelmed.

00:01:56.019 --> 00:01:58.019
It's a promise of our future.

00:01:58.019 --> 00:02:13.229
And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes and death will be no more.

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:17.229
Neither will morning nor outcry, no pain be anymore.

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:20.229
The former things have passed away.

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:25.229
This scripture has gone me through some of the worst times of my life.

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:32.229
But there's also an amazing article that goes through each piece of the promise.

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:38.229
Our sister could have used JW Library to look up the scripture.

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:41.229
And that would be fine.

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:53.229
But by using JW.org, she had this scripture, related articles, and videos right at her fingertips.

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:57.229
The search page acted as her guide.

00:02:57.229 --> 00:03:01.229
Depending on the language you choose on JW.org,

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:08.229
the search results can vary since not every article or video is available in all languages.

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:14.229
But you will find something helpful related to your entered scripture.

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:21.229
She could focus on really listening and being a compassionate person.

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:25.229
What if she didn't have a scripture in mind to share?

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:27.229
Let's see what she does now.

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:39.990
Here's a video of those that felt the pain of losing a loved one.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.990
And this is how they coped.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:59.580
Again, effectively searching with JW.org, proved helpful.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.580
Did you notice her search terms?

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:14.060
She chose words specific to the situation, but general enough to encompass a variety of articles and videos.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:24.060
If she only typed in death, articles on Jesus' death and being afraid of death would be featured.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.060
Not helpful in this situation.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:35.060
But by focusing the topic, the right article or video is a click away.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.060
And remember the benefit of using JW.org?

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:46.060
Her workmate can now explore the site on her own.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:59.449
Now, what can we do if the householder speaks a different language?

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:01.449
Hello.

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:05.449
I want to introduce you to the Chinese.

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.449
Where can I find the right article?

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:11.449
Wow, your Chinese is pretty good.

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:13.449
That's pretty much all I got.

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:18.009
Where are you visiting from?

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:21.009
Do you know how to find more answers from the Bible?

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:23.480
Sure.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:29.480
On this website, you will find the digital version of the brochure you have and many others.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:36.399
And if you want to read the site in a different language, you tap here.

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:37.399
Here's Mandarin.

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:38.399
Thank you.

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:41.129
You're welcome.

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:49.790
We give people the Bible's powerful message in the language of their heart.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.790
So, take time to get familiar with JW.org.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:06:00.790
Why not practice searching your favorite scriptures and seeing the related articles that come up?

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:07.790
Or you can rehearse, switching the website to a language others commonly speak in your area.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:16.790
By sharpening our skills, we can focus on the people in front of us and help them get to know our God, Jehovah.
