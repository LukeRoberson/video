00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:09.070
Let's meet fellow believer and Helacup Pintado who overcame something that held her back from joining a language group in her area.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.149
My name is Angelica Pintado. I was born in Ecuador and I moved to New York in the year 2001.

00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:25.149
I have been a regular pioneer for a few years now and it has always been my desire to do more for Jehovah.

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:30.149
Something that helped me was a conversation I had with the circuit overseer.

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:38.149
Where he encouraged me to learn a new language so that I could help others learn about Jehovah in their mother tongue.

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:47.149
Now that I have decided to join the Guarani group, I have seen clearly how Jehovah has molded me as the great potter.

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.149
One of the challenges I had in the beginning was fear, but I continue to trust in Jehovah.

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:03.149
And by sharing the message with other people, seeing their reaction to the good news, this has helped me to continue.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.150
I have seen how Jehovah has used me as an instrument to share the message with other people.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:23.150
Additionally, my first Bible study is now my best friend and seeing others whom she has helped to come to know Jehovah is truly a great privilege.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:35.150
I have no words to explain my gratitude to Jehovah for having used me and truly it's something that we can only experience if we give our best to Jehovah.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.420
Like Sister Pintado, each of us wants to give our best to Jehovah.
