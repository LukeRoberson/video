00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:08.259
Going out and fill service after lunch. Yes, I'm gonna be there

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:21.379
But I've got one or two visits that got to make all right. He's needed my neighbor lost his job after 20 years

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.739
And as a result, he's got to move out of his house. Got to move into an apartment

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.460
Decided to go help him out a little bit to pack up

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.979
Make a little easier for him to make that move

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:40.500
You know want to be nice a time period where we don't have to worry about economic troubles like that

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:47.619
Yeah, it will you know, that's why I'm so happy that my grandchildren chose to go for higher education

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:51.140
They both landed good job on that bridge that you cross when you come here

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.060
You've noticed that they're starting to do some work on it and that's pretty extensive work

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.460
They're gonna replace that whole bridge so according to the newspaper article. It's gonna be like a six to eight month project

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.460
That is a long time

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.980
You know Chris the reason I came by is I wanted to show you this magazine. I love these. They're so well written

00:01:10.379 --> 00:01:14.140
Isaiah 48-17 is a key scripture here. Notice what it says

00:01:15.019 --> 00:01:20.299
I Jehovah and your God the one teaching you to benefit yourself

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:24.540
That's familiar. I think your dad read that to me once or twice

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.420
How's your dad doing anyway?

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.060
Doing good, you know, they said they've got more Bible says than they can even cover in one week

00:01:32.379 --> 00:01:37.659
Well, well, you know, I can remember when you and your dad came here and you were a little kid about this high

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.819
And you just stayed right by his side and your dad was so proud

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.819
You know Chris I know my dad had offered to stay the Bible with you in the past

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:50.859
John be honest, uh

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:53.099
I'm too old to change

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:55.099
Said in my ways now

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:57.819
I think that God's just gonna have to take me the way I am

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.540
We're chocolate

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.780
Yeah
