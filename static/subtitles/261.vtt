00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.550
Every Christian youth must ask himself a soul-searching question.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.550
What will I do with my life?

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:23.489
Much like Christian youth today,

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:26.489
a young man named Timothy was faced with the decision

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:32.049
about what to do with his life.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.049
Timothy lived in the first century.

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:37.049
His home was evidently a town called Listera

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:39.049
in the Roman province of Galatia.

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:42.710
Timothy's godly mother Eunice

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.710
and believing grandmother Lois raised him

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.789
to love and serve Jehovah.

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.789
However, Timothy's father was an unbeliever

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:54.789
and as such,

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.789
would likely have promoted the goals offered by the Roman world.

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:02.740
Like young ones today,

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.739
Timothy would undoubtedly have been subjected

00:01:05.739 --> 00:01:07.739
to the influence of instructors

00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:09.739
who would promote worldly philosophy.

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:13.689
What would he do with his life?

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:20.819
A significant event in Timothy's life

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:22.819
was the visit of the Apostle Paul.

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:29.359
In time,

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:31.359
Lois, Eunice,

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:34.359
and Timothy all became Christians.

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:43.049
Little did Timothy realize

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.049
how profound an influence Paul would have on his life.

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:54.620
By the time Paul returned to Listera,

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.620
Timothy had grown into a well-respected young man.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.620
Paul chose him to be his traveling companion.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:10.379
Timothy greatly benefited from Paul's training.

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.379
In time,

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:23.129
Timothy himself qualified to serve as a traveling overseer

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.129
after years of association together.

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.129
Paul and Timothy were separated.

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.129
Paul had been arrested

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:33.129
and sentenced to death.

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:38.300
Before his execution,

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.300
Paul wrote Timothy a final letter.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:49.379
By the time Timothy received it,

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.379
Paul may already have been executed.

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:57.000
His final admonition to Timothy

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
keep your senses in all things.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Do the work of an evangelizer,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
fully accomplish your ministry.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.060
Like young Timothy,

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.060
Christian used today face a choice,

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.060
whether to use their lives in vain pursuits

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:33.210
or in the service of Jehovah.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.210
I always loved to run.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.210
I guess it started when I was little.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.210
I'd raise all the kids in the neighborhood.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.210
When I got older,

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.210
I'd run just to clear my mind.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:52.180
Running just seemed to come natural to me.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.180
In high school,

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.180
running on the track team

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.180
became the most important thing in my life.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.180
But in the spring of my junior year,

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.180
some things were happening

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.180
that took my mind off my game.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:18.610
My mother and grandmother had become Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.610
I wasn't baptized yet,

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.610
but I knew it was the truth.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.610
The more I learned about the truth,

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.610
the more I questioned

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.610
how important running should be in my life.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:45.660
Andre, everything okay?

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.660
Yeah, good, everything's great.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.660
Fell asleep at the will back there,

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.660
lost a lot of time.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.660
Yeah, no.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.660
You know, I expect a lot more

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.660
from my star sprinter.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.660
You seem distracted.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.660
So how about they pulling you

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:00.660
from the winter invitation, is it?

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.660
No, of course.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.660
You know how strict the school is

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.660
about letting students compete with an injury?

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.660
Insurance, liability.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.660
Coach, that's not it, really.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.660
Look, I did zone out,

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.660
but it won't happen again.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:12.660
I promise.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.660
That's what I wanted to hear, Andre.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.660
Thursday, after school,

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.660
we'll do some extra work on that line pass.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.660
Yeah, sure.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.420
I don't know.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.420
Range that coach.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.420
Sorry I got my meeting.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.420
Meeting?

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.420
Andre, we've got an invitational next week

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.420
in the divisional in three weeks.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.420
That besides you've missed him before.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.420
I know, but this is different.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.420
I have an assignment.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.420
I'm giving a talk.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.420
A talk.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.420
Last time, it was something else.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.420
You know, coach, this is important to me.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.420
Look, your religion is your business.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.420
But this team is mine.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.420
If you want to run, I need 100%.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.420
I need you to focus.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.420
Something you've had real trouble with lately.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.990
Look, Andre.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.990
If you win the divisional meet,

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.990
you'll go to state.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.990
There'll be a dozen college scouts

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.990
with big fat scholarships lined up to meet you.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.990
Coach, you know I want to win.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.990
Here's your chance to prove to yourself

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.990
that you've got what it takes.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.910
Your teammates are counting on you, Andre.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:24.620
Look, you'd do your thing Thursday night

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.620
if it's that important to you.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.620
But you're mine after that.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.620
Got it?

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.620
Got it.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.620
And I hit the shower.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:32.620
Sure thing, coach.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:41.899
Coach Clark knew how badly I wanted to win.

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:46.519
And he was right.

00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:48.519
I was distracted.

00:06:48.519 --> 00:06:52.310
That week I was giving my first talk

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:54.310
on the pediatric ministry school.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.310
I'd known about it for a while,

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.310
but I had been so busy with track practice,

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.310
I hadn't even started on it.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.139
Good things to come.

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:08.139
But not the very substance of the things.

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:11.139
Men can never with the same sacrifice.

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:13.139
With only a couple of days left,

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:15.139
the pressure was on to get it done.

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:19.139
Even so, I was having trouble focusing on that too.

00:07:19.139 --> 00:08:15.439
Feeling a regular monk or something.

00:08:15.439 --> 00:08:17.439
Just with some reading, that's all.

00:08:17.439 --> 00:08:19.439
Maybe she'd do some reading to how to take off

00:08:19.439 --> 00:08:20.439
and I hit my mark.

00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:22.439
Like you never messed up.

00:08:22.439 --> 00:08:23.439
Besides, I made up the last time.

00:08:23.439 --> 00:08:25.439
Come on, man.

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:27.439
It's like your head's not in the game anymore.

00:08:27.439 --> 00:08:30.439
Ever since you started hanging out at that church.

00:08:30.439 --> 00:08:31.439
Kingdom Hall.

00:08:31.439 --> 00:08:32.440
Whatever.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.440
It's like you've been going through changes or something.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.440
I mean, when's the last time we just hung out?

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.039
You always got some lame excuse.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:47.909
Look, everything's okay between you and me really.

00:08:48.909 --> 00:08:49.909
I just got a lot going on.

00:08:49.909 --> 00:08:50.909
That's all.

00:08:50.909 --> 00:08:56.240
Burdo, trust me.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.240
We're going to win.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.240
We better.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.240
But two good reasons.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.240
Reason number one.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.240
College scholarships.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.240
You need it and you know I need it.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.240
What's reason number two?

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.240
Pixies on the cereal box.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.240
After we win the gold at the Olympics.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.240
That's right.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:18.590
Hey, Mom. Hey, Grandma.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:35.659
Chicken looks great, Mom.

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:37.659
I'm Jane.

00:09:37.659 --> 00:09:39.659
Don't you own me an explanation?

00:09:40.659 --> 00:09:41.659
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:09:41.659 --> 00:09:42.659
Practice is friendly.

00:09:42.659 --> 00:09:43.659
Again?

00:09:43.659 --> 00:09:45.659
Well, like Dad says.

00:09:45.659 --> 00:09:46.659
Practice makes perfect.

00:09:46.659 --> 00:09:48.659
Do they have to work you so hard?

00:09:48.659 --> 00:09:50.659
You barely have time for anything else.

00:09:50.659 --> 00:09:52.659
Like that talk you have this week.

00:09:52.659 --> 00:09:53.659
Hey, Dad.

00:09:53.659 --> 00:09:57.379
Hi, honey.

00:09:57.379 --> 00:10:00.909
Hey, son.

00:10:01.909 --> 00:10:02.909
Hey, Grandma.

00:10:02.909 --> 00:10:03.909
Hey, honey.

00:10:03.909 --> 00:10:05.909
How was work?

00:10:05.909 --> 00:10:10.610
Not one of my better days.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.610
My new website kept crashing.

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:15.610
Dad, we worked on that blind pass today.

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:18.610
It needs a little work, but I think we're real close.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:20.610
Oh, now 100 meters, Brent.

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.610
They may as well give me the trophy now.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:23.610
Oh, that sounds great, sir.

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.610
Yeah, Coach Clark is a little worried.

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:27.610
But I think if we can ace the invitation next week,

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:30.610
then a divisional in three weeks is in the bag.

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:33.610
Oh, divisional in three weeks.

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:35.610
Andre, I'm not going to be able to make it.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:38.610
I'm going to be at a town with some investors there a week.

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.610
No big deal, Dad.

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:44.080
I know you disappointed.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.080
I'm going to make it up to you.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.080
I know how hard you trained for this.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.080
Maybe a little too much training.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.080
How's that?

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.080
Well, I think it's too much for him.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.080
He hardly has time to eat,

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.080
and I know that it's affecting his grades.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.080
My grades are okay.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.080
Okay.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.080
Andre, okay isn't good enough.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.080
Once you're in the business world,

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.080
you have to be better than everyone else.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.080
You'll get eaten alive.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.080
Dad, I just got a lot going on.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.080
That's all.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.080
Practice testing all that.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.080
Let's see.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.080
Practice tests.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.080
Aren't you leaving something out?

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.080
What about all the time you spend going to those meetings?

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.080
But you said it was okay for me to go.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.080
If?

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:28.509
If it didn't interfere with school.

00:11:28.509 --> 00:11:29.509
Right.

00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:36.009
Honey, I don't think they're going to the Kingdom Halls the problem.

00:11:36.009 --> 00:11:37.009
No, Dad.

00:11:37.009 --> 00:11:39.009
It's just the Coach Clark is step to part training.

00:11:39.009 --> 00:11:42.009
Andre, if you try to do it all, something's going to suffer.

00:11:42.009 --> 00:11:46.009
You're going to have to start being more responsible, son.

00:11:46.009 --> 00:11:48.009
Well, this Thursday,

00:11:48.009 --> 00:11:51.009
Andre's going to do something very responsible.

00:11:51.009 --> 00:11:54.009
He's going to give a talk in front of a hundred people at our congregation.

00:11:54.009 --> 00:11:57.009
Well, I don't see how it's going to help him do better in school.

00:11:57.009 --> 00:11:59.009
Or anywhere else for that matter.

00:11:59.009 --> 00:12:03.009
Well, he's learning how to communicate, to teach.

00:12:03.009 --> 00:12:07.009
These are skills that can help Andre in whatever he chooses to do.

00:12:07.009 --> 00:12:11.009
Honey, why don't you come to us talk and say for yourself?

00:12:11.009 --> 00:12:13.009
Yeah, Dad, you don't have to stay for the home meeting.

00:12:13.009 --> 00:12:16.419
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

00:12:16.419 --> 00:12:18.419
We all had an understanding, right?

00:12:19.419 --> 00:12:21.419
This is not my religion, this is yours.

00:12:21.419 --> 00:12:23.419
No offense, son.

00:12:23.419 --> 00:12:27.419
I will not go to the Kingdom Hall, not now, not ever.

00:12:27.419 --> 00:12:29.919
Understand?

00:12:29.919 --> 00:12:35.350
Honey, I just thought that if you don't mind,

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.350
I would like to finish my dinner in peace.

00:12:37.350 --> 00:13:23.960
Can I come in?

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.960
Oh, hi, Mom. Sure, come on in.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:30.649
I brought you something.

00:13:30.649 --> 00:13:31.649
Thanks, Mom.

00:13:31.649 --> 00:13:35.600
Looks like you're working on your talk.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.600
Yeah, I'm getting there.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:46.419
Andre, your dad loves you very much.

00:13:46.419 --> 00:13:49.419
He's had a hard time out there, and he doesn't want you

00:13:49.419 --> 00:13:53.419
to have the same struggles or make the same mistakes.

00:13:53.419 --> 00:14:01.970
Neither do I, but your grandmom and I,

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:03.970
we have another concern.

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:08.980
I know your dad supports your running,

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:10.980
and I'm trying not to interfere.

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:17.509
I don't want anything to become more important

00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:20.509
than your relationship with Jehovah.

00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:26.429
Can I love running in Jehovah?

00:14:26.429 --> 00:14:29.429
Do you remember what Jesus said?

00:14:29.429 --> 00:14:32.429
You cannot slave for two masters.

00:14:32.429 --> 00:14:36.429
You end up loving one and hating the other.

00:14:36.429 --> 00:14:41.860
Son, I know what...

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:57.659
Well, I better get this talk finished.

00:14:57.659 --> 00:15:00.659
I know you do a good job, honey.

00:15:00.659 --> 00:15:09.850
And if he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:13.850
Now, we are not the sort that shrinks back to destruction,

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:17.850
but the sort that have faith to the preserving alive of the soul.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:22.570
Christians are runners.

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:27.070
Runners in the race for life.

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:30.070
We must have endurance to finish that race.

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:33.070
Runners in a long distance race often eat a lot

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:36.070
of carbohydrates the night before.

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:39.070
Like a long-distance runner, we can build up a reserve

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:43.070
of spiritual strength by feeding on spiritual food.

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:46.070
This will help us to run the race with endurance

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:49.070
and to gain the prize of everlasting life.

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:57.830
And again, great job on your talk tonight.

00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:59.830
Hey, we're looking forward to your next one.

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:01.830
Thanks, I appreciate it.

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:03.830
You're an evening, Andre.

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:05.830
Oh, brother, classic.

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:07.830
That was your first talk.

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:09.830
A real milestone.

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:11.830
You did an excellent job.

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:12.830
Thanks for the classic.

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:16.830
Your illustration about eating carbohydrates.

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:18.830
Very effective.

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:21.830
Well, I guess talking about running comes really easy to me.

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.830
So I've heard you know.

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:26.830
I was in response to myself when I was young.

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:27.830
You were?

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:30.830
Don't let this painful you, young man.

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:34.830
When I was your age, I had dreams of swimming in the Olympics.

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:36.830
Really, I never knew that.

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:40.830
Perhaps someday I will tell you about it.

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:43.830
Say, I was wondering,

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:45.830
do you know often energetic young man

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:48.830
who could help me with a small project around the house?

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:50.830
Sure, brother, classic.

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:51.830
I'd be happy to help.

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:54.830
I could come by Saturday after practice.

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:56.830
Wunderbar.

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:58.830
Now, I knew that brother, classic,

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:00.830
had been an elder for years.

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:02.830
And he had even been a circuit overseer.

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:04.829
So I was a little nervous.

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:06.829
I actually thought about cancelling.

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:11.829
But I decided to keep my word and help him out that day.

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:14.829
I'm glad that I did.

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:16.829
OK, you two, it's getting late.

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:17.829
Come on inside.

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:19.829
I just made a fresh picture of lemonade.

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:49.940
Know you have to take your medicine.

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:52.940
Ah, medicine is for sick people.

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:55.940
I've never felt better in my life.

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:56.940
You know better.

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:59.940
You really push yourself too hard sometimes.

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.940
I don't pay you to lecture me.

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:04.940
You don't pay me at all, dad.

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.940
Now, take your medicine, please.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:08.940
I have to get home.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:10.940
Jack and I have that new Bible study tonight.

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:17.480
You see, it's the freedom.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.480
Don't cut, puppy.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:23.819
Now, you two enjoy yourselves.

00:18:23.819 --> 00:18:25.819
Don't let him keep you too late, Andre.

00:18:25.819 --> 00:18:29.140
Why is this to Sanders?

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:32.140
Andre, when I heard your talk the other night,

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.140
I thought to myself,

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:37.140
this young man has potential.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:40.140
Excellent illustrations.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:42.140
By the way, did you use the index

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:44.140
when you research your talk?

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.140
What index?

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.140
Ah.

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:50.140
The index is like a map to hidden treasures.

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:53.140
You just have to know how to use that map.

00:18:53.140 --> 00:19:03.250
Can you see that dark red book over there?

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:04.250
This one here?

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:05.250
Yes, please.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:14.740
Have a seat.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:20.420
The light please.

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:23.420
This is a watchtower publication index.

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:28.420
In it, you find different subject in alphabetical order.

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:31.420
Let's say, for example,

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:39.269
that you want information on endurance.

00:19:39.269 --> 00:19:42.269
Do you see all the subheadings under endurance?

00:19:42.269 --> 00:19:43.269
Yes, lots.

00:19:43.269 --> 00:19:46.269
Adversity, cultivating,

00:19:46.269 --> 00:19:51.269
David, Jehovah, Jesus Christ, modern day witnesses.

00:19:51.269 --> 00:19:53.269
Under each subheading,

00:19:53.269 --> 00:19:56.269
you see a list of references.

00:19:56.269 --> 00:20:01.269
Now, to find out what these abbreviations mean,

00:20:01.269 --> 00:20:05.269
you just turn to the front of the index

00:20:05.269 --> 00:20:09.269
and here you have them.

00:20:09.269 --> 00:20:12.269
And you know, there's another interesting feature.

00:20:12.269 --> 00:20:15.269
For example, you read a Bible text

00:20:15.269 --> 00:20:22.039
and you want to know.

00:20:22.039 --> 00:20:24.039
We had a race with a local school that week

00:20:24.039 --> 00:20:27.039
and the divisional meet was getting closer.

00:20:27.039 --> 00:20:30.039
So the coach was really stepping up the pressure.

00:20:30.039 --> 00:20:31.039
All right, back kicks.

00:20:31.039 --> 00:20:38.990
All right, look what you're there, Andre.

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.990
Stick!

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:44.980
Most love you there, Baker and Jones.

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:45.980
All right, reset.

00:20:45.980 --> 00:21:05.539
Let you know we're on your feet.

00:21:05.539 --> 00:21:06.539
Here you go.

00:21:06.539 --> 00:21:07.539
Some more paint.

00:21:07.539 --> 00:21:08.539
My friend.

00:21:08.539 --> 00:21:11.210
Thank you.

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:14.210
By the way, I didn't see you at the meteor on Thursday night.

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:17.210
I was concerned you had taken sick.

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:18.210
Oh, no.

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.210
It's because the divisional meet is just two weeks away.

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:22.210
The coach is really pushing us hard.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:24.210
It takes a lot to be a winner, doesn't it?

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:29.809
How far do you think you'll go with your running?

00:21:29.809 --> 00:21:32.809
I've always dreamed of running in the Olympics.

00:21:32.809 --> 00:21:34.809
But I don't know if I'm good enough for that.

00:21:34.809 --> 00:21:37.809
I'll probably get a scholarship to a good university.

00:21:37.809 --> 00:21:38.809
Get a good job.

00:21:38.809 --> 00:21:40.809
I'd be pretty happy with that.

00:21:40.809 --> 00:21:42.809
Ah, education.

00:21:42.809 --> 00:21:43.809
A good job.

00:21:43.809 --> 00:21:46.809
It's nice to think about these things.

00:21:46.809 --> 00:21:51.150
What sort of spiritual goals do you have?

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:53.150
Oh, you mean they're getting baptized?

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:55.150
I definitely plan on doing that.

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:57.150
When I'm ready.

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.150
Ah, excellent.

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:04.150
Baptism opens a door to a life of service to Jehovah.

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:10.150
Have you ever thought about the many opportunities open for a young man like you?

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:12.150
Bessel service?

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:13.150
Pioneering?

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:14.150
Ministerial training school?

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:15.150
Me?

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:19.150
I don't know if I'm cut out for any of that, but if I say...

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:22.150
It's not a requirement, isn't it?

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:23.150
Requirement?

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:24.150
No.

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:30.150
But Jehovah does require that we give him our best.

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:34.230
Well, how do you know what your best is?

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:39.180
The coach says you are the best runner on the team.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.180
Why does he think that?

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:43.180
I know them fast, because I work really hard at it.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.180
I take it very seriously.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:49.180
Ah, now, suppose you start missing practice.

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:52.180
You are destructed by other things.

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:57.180
The day of the big race comes and you finish in last place.

00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:01.180
How would the coach feel then?

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.180
I would not be happy.

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:04.180
And why?

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:06.180
He knows what I can do.

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:07.180
What I'm capable of.

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:14.859
I guess he didn't know I wasn't giving it my best.

00:23:14.859 --> 00:23:42.359
Coach, you want to see me?

00:23:42.359 --> 00:23:43.359
Hey, Andre.

00:23:43.359 --> 00:23:45.359
Come on in, son.

00:23:45.359 --> 00:23:51.579
Are you okay?

00:23:51.579 --> 00:23:53.579
Oh, yeah, fine.

00:23:53.579 --> 00:23:55.579
Snowden's reacting up again.

00:23:55.579 --> 00:23:56.579
That's all.

00:23:56.579 --> 00:23:58.579
How did it happen?

00:23:58.579 --> 00:23:59.579
Ah.

00:24:00.579 --> 00:24:02.579
My junior year in college.

00:24:02.579 --> 00:24:05.579
I was practicing for the conference finals.

00:24:05.579 --> 00:24:08.579
I was coming around the curve.

00:24:08.579 --> 00:24:10.579
My knee goes out.

00:24:10.579 --> 00:24:13.579
I go down like a sack of potatoes.

00:24:13.579 --> 00:24:16.579
So you didn't get to run in the finals?

00:24:16.579 --> 00:24:18.579
Well, I got to run, all right.

00:24:18.579 --> 00:24:21.579
I got some real strong pain killer.

00:24:21.579 --> 00:24:24.579
A lot of guys use that stuff.

00:24:24.579 --> 00:24:26.579
Wish I had that for the winter and rotational.

00:24:26.579 --> 00:24:27.579
Yeah, right.

00:24:27.579 --> 00:24:30.579
As soon as the school found out I'll let you run with an injury,

00:24:30.579 --> 00:24:32.579
I'd be out of a job.

00:24:32.579 --> 00:24:36.579
Anyway, stuff worked all right.

00:24:36.579 --> 00:24:37.579
I won the race.

00:24:37.579 --> 00:24:41.089
But your leg got messed up.

00:24:41.089 --> 00:24:44.089
Yeah, a couple surgeries.

00:24:44.089 --> 00:24:47.089
Pain killer from time to time.

00:24:47.089 --> 00:24:50.089
But I tell you what, Dempster.

00:24:50.089 --> 00:24:52.089
I don't regret it a bit.

00:24:52.089 --> 00:25:02.329
I finally got to taste what being a winner.

00:25:02.329 --> 00:25:07.910
It's all about.

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:10.910
Coach, I know what you wanted to see me.

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:13.910
Because your performance today was less than stellar?

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:14.910
Something like that.

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:16.910
No, that's not why.

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:24.480
I want to have a seat.

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:29.480
Andre, I've known you for almost three years now.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:33.480
Probably spent more time with you than with my own kids.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.480
You're one of my best runners.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.480
Hands down.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:40.480
If there's anyone on this team that's got what it takes to be a winner,

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.480
it's you.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.480
Listen to me at some little high school race.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.619
Spat your future.

00:25:49.619 --> 00:25:54.619
Son, you have a gift.

00:25:54.619 --> 00:25:56.619
A God-given gift.

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:02.180
Don't waste it.

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:05.180
Listen to your heart.

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:08.460
Be what you know you can be.

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:15.059
A winner.

00:26:15.059 --> 00:26:17.059
Sure thing, coach.

00:26:17.059 --> 00:26:19.059
All right, go home and get some rest.

00:26:19.059 --> 00:26:25.750
And Andre, try not to hurt yourself this damn partner.

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:34.809
So, Andre, is the coach still working you very hard?

00:26:34.809 --> 00:26:35.809
Oh, yeah.

00:26:35.809 --> 00:26:37.809
But we never win otherwise.

00:26:37.809 --> 00:26:40.809
Winning means a lot to you, doesn't it?

00:26:40.809 --> 00:26:42.809
The rush across in the finish line?

00:26:42.809 --> 00:26:44.809
Win in the trophy?

00:26:44.809 --> 00:26:46.809
I guess it's hard to explain.

00:26:46.809 --> 00:26:49.809
Ah, the finishing touch.

00:26:49.809 --> 00:26:53.150
Very common.

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:57.099
Welcome.

00:26:57.099 --> 00:26:59.099
Andre.

00:26:59.099 --> 00:27:03.099
Do you remember how I told you that I used to swim?

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:15.390
I haven't looked at this for years.

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:23.309
Ah, here it is.

00:27:23.309 --> 00:27:25.309
Well, the flexic, is that you?

00:27:25.309 --> 00:27:27.309
I'm not bad, is it?

00:27:27.309 --> 00:27:29.309
I laughed swimming.

00:27:29.309 --> 00:27:31.309
My dream was to swim in the Olympics,

00:27:31.309 --> 00:27:34.309
and my coaches told me I had the talent.

00:27:34.309 --> 00:27:36.309
So, why didn't you?

00:27:36.309 --> 00:27:40.309
My goals seemed right within my grasp.

00:27:40.309 --> 00:27:45.650
Then one day...

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:47.650
The witnesses.

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:49.650
I laughed what I was learning.

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:52.650
I knew it was a truth.

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:57.650
At first, I tried very hard to be dedicated to Jehovah

00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:00.650
as well as to my sport.

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:02.650
Were you able to?

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:04.650
I missed many meetings.

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:10.650
I realized the truthfulness of Jesus' word.

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:13.650
You cannot slave for two masters.

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:17.650
So, I took a stand for Jehovah

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:23.500
and resigned from my swim team.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:27.500
It was a good thing that I did.

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:29.500
Why is that?

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:33.500
Andre, the world went to war.

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.500
The Olympics were cancelled.

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:40.500
Many of my former teammates joined Hitler's army.

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:44.500
I shatter to think that I might have joined them.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.500
No way I would have done that.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:51.500
Millions did put face in hateless promises.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.500
But only because I was active in the truth.

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:58.329
I was not deceived.

00:28:58.329 --> 00:29:01.329
Like so many of our brothers,

00:29:01.329 --> 00:29:07.980
I was arrested and thrown into the concentration camp.

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:13.220
Many of our brothers lost their lives.

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:17.220
It was only with Jehovah's help.

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:19.220
I endured.

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:23.220
But in spite of everything,

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:25.220
I was happy.

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:27.220
Happy?

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:29.220
How could you be happy?

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:33.220
Happiness does not come from possession of worldly success.

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:39.220
Happiness comes from knowing you are pleasing to Jehovah.

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:43.220
In the camp, we had the opportunity

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:46.220
to prove our love for Jehovah

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:50.220
and we learned to trust him absolutely.

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:57.769
That made us happy.

00:29:57.769 --> 00:30:17.299
Let me show you something.

00:30:17.299 --> 00:30:19.299
In the camp I had this.

00:30:19.299 --> 00:30:23.420
When I was your age,

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:26.420
I wanted many things.

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:29.420
Fame, money.

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:31.420
How do you call it?

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:33.420
The good life.

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:37.420
In the camp, that meant nothing.

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:41.420
But this bowl meant something.

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:48.809
With it, I could eat and live.

00:30:48.809 --> 00:30:54.789
Ever so often, I take it out as a reminder.

00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:57.789
A reminder of one.

00:30:57.789 --> 00:31:00.789
That when we put Jehovah first,

00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:05.069
we don't need many material things.

00:31:05.069 --> 00:31:25.599
All we really need is our spoon and bowl.

00:31:25.599 --> 00:31:29.599
After I was released from the camp,

00:31:29.599 --> 00:31:33.599
I decided to serve Jehovah in the full-time service.

00:31:33.599 --> 00:31:39.599
Eventually, I married my dear wife, Gisela.

00:31:39.599 --> 00:31:44.599
We had a wonderful life together in Jehovah's service.

00:31:44.599 --> 00:31:47.599
Together, we served as pioneers,

00:31:47.599 --> 00:31:49.599
then in the circuit work,

00:31:49.599 --> 00:31:52.599
and in raising our daughter joy.

00:31:52.599 --> 00:31:55.599
Andre, do you see all these people

00:31:55.599 --> 00:31:58.599
was by my wife and myself?

00:31:58.599 --> 00:32:00.599
Yeah, who are they?

00:32:00.599 --> 00:32:02.599
These are just some of the people

00:32:02.599 --> 00:32:05.599
we helped come into the truth.

00:32:05.599 --> 00:32:12.519
No trophy could have brought me so much joy.

00:32:12.519 --> 00:32:20.259
But what if the war hadn't come for the flicing?

00:32:20.259 --> 00:32:25.299
Do you think you might have regretted giving up your dreams?

00:32:25.299 --> 00:32:27.299
Dad, I'll be right in with your medicine.

00:32:27.299 --> 00:32:29.299
Okay, darling.

00:32:29.299 --> 00:32:36.220
Andre, when you get home,

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:41.220
look up Philippians chapter 3 verse 8.

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:46.009
I think that will answer your question.

00:32:46.009 --> 00:32:53.990
Why, for that matter,

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:56.990
I do indeed also consider all things to be lost

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:58.990
on account of the excelling value

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:01.990
of the knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord.

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:04.990
On account of Him, I have taken the loss of all things

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:07.990
and I consider them as a lot of refuse.

00:33:13.569 --> 00:33:16.569
Grandma, what do you think for the flicing man?

00:33:16.569 --> 00:33:21.569
Well, the Apostle Paul said he'd taken the loss of all things.

00:33:21.569 --> 00:33:25.519
What do you think he meant?

00:33:25.519 --> 00:33:27.519
All the things he gave up.

00:33:27.519 --> 00:33:30.519
Right. Paul was a well-educated man.

00:33:30.519 --> 00:33:33.519
He could have become rich and famous.

00:33:33.519 --> 00:33:35.519
But once he learned the truth about the Christ,

00:33:35.519 --> 00:33:37.519
he gave all that up.

00:33:37.519 --> 00:33:40.990
We'd the last part of that verse again.

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:44.990
And I consider them as a lot of refuse.

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.990
Refused like garbage.

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:49.990
So, Paul realized that in the long run,

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:52.990
all the things he gave up were nothing but garbage.

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:55.990
Here today, gone tomorrow.

00:33:55.990 --> 00:34:04.859
Grandma, is it wrong for me to want to become a track star?

00:34:04.859 --> 00:34:06.859
Is it wrong?

00:34:06.859 --> 00:34:16.969
It comes down to the price you're willing to pay.

00:34:16.969 --> 00:34:18.969
And what do you mean?

00:34:18.969 --> 00:34:23.969
Remember how Satan offered Jesus all the kingdoms of the world?

00:34:23.969 --> 00:34:25.969
What did Satan want in return?

00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:29.730
He wanted Jesus to worship him.

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:35.710
If you want to be a star, in Satan's world,

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:40.219
don't you think he's going to want something from you?

00:34:40.219 --> 00:34:49.260
That path down the line.

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:51.260
Poetry and motion, man. That trophy's a bag.

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:54.260
I'll just have to run a little bit faster to make up for your lost time.

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:55.260
Why? I can whip you any day.

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:56.260
In your dreams.

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:58.260
Ooh. Team Anchorman.

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:00.260
Coaches Pat. Big star.

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:02.260
I take you any day.

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:04.260
Here to the other end of the line.

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:07.260
That's what I thought. Come on, are you just shouting?

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:08.260
No, I understand.

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:10.260
Now I want to get whipped in front of these girls.

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:11.260
Not good for your rep.

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:13.260
A bird.

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.260
What?

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:43.070
Go.

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:44.070
Are you okay?

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:45.070
Oh, Coaches is going to kill me.

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:46.070
The same guy.

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:47.070
Come on.

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:52.500
You see if I can get you off.

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.500
Shit, maybe you're torsing to me.

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:55.500
Probably Saturday's last time.

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.500
Oh, man, they're saying funny.

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.500
Oh, how am I going to run tomorrow?

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:00.500
I can't believe this.

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:01.500
Stay calm.

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:02.500
Stay calm.

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:03.500
You just need a shot.

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:04.500
You know, painkillers.

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:05.500
The pros use it all the time.

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:06.500
No, man, forget it.

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:08.500
Payment found out the coach are getting trouble.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:09.500
The school don't have to know.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:10.500
Nobody does.

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.500
I know just what you need.

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:13.500
Man, I don't know about that.

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:15.500
And no, bro, forget it.

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:17.500
Look, man.

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:19.500
Do you really want to watch another me from the sidelines?

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:20.500
Huh?

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.500
Besides, without you, I team his sunk.

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.500
I'm sunk.

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:26.500
Now wait the time to get right to saw me, Andre.

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:32.210
Bro, come on.

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:34.210
You're not breaking no law.

00:36:34.210 --> 00:36:36.210
Just some dumb rule.

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:40.210
Let's go before a coach sees you like this.

00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:43.210
And trust me, it'll be okay.

00:36:43.210 --> 00:37:59.769
Andre, I'm trying to tell you.

00:37:59.769 --> 00:38:01.769
They cannot stop the true blue wild bell.

00:38:01.769 --> 00:38:03.769
They tried it, but we did it, bro.

00:38:03.769 --> 00:38:09.699
See, I told you that stuff will work.

00:38:09.699 --> 00:38:13.139
It's secret safe for me.

00:38:13.139 --> 00:38:29.099
Every time a student walks by the trophy case,

00:38:29.099 --> 00:38:31.099
he's going to see this.

00:38:31.099 --> 00:38:34.980
Have to be careful, though.

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:37.980
We can't rest on our laurels and our accomplishments.

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:40.980
Next, there's the state championships.

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:46.980
And for some of you, it doesn't have to stop there.

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:51.980
So what I need is more focus, more commitment,

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:53.980
and more dedication.

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:58.260
I'll require some hard work, some sacrifice.

00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:00.260
But it's worth it, isn't it?

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:07.260
Question is, are y'all up to the challenge?

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:09.260
Yes!

00:40:03.989 --> 00:40:06.989
If you want to be a star in Satan's world,

00:40:06.989 --> 00:40:09.989
don't you think he's going to want something from you?

00:40:09.989 --> 00:40:16.300
But I'm just afraid that running is slowing you down spiritually.

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:49.570
They could have brought me so much.

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:52.460
Oh, there you are.

00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:53.460
I'll be back in a little while.

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:58.239
I got to see Brother Fleissig.

00:40:58.239 --> 00:40:59.239
Is everything all right?

00:40:59.239 --> 00:41:07.030
Man, what's wrong?

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:10.030
Andre, that was Joy.

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:14.030
Brother Fleissig, he died this afternoon.

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:20.099
I'm so sorry, honey.

00:41:20.099 --> 00:41:21.099
I'm so sorry.

00:41:21.099 --> 00:42:59.429
I wish I could see him just one more time.

00:42:59.429 --> 00:43:04.119
I really needed to talk to him.

00:43:04.119 --> 00:43:06.119
I want you to know Dad really cared about you, Andre.

00:43:06.119 --> 00:43:10.070
And he left this for you.

00:43:10.070 --> 00:44:03.619
It's something he wanted you to have.

00:44:03.619 --> 00:44:05.619
My dear friend, Andre.

00:44:05.619 --> 00:44:10.619
I want you to have this little moment of our times together.

00:44:10.619 --> 00:44:16.619
I hope that you will always remember the lesson it taught me.

00:44:16.619 --> 00:44:19.619
I have been sick for some time.

00:44:19.619 --> 00:44:25.619
And I'm afraid that soon this tired heart of mine will stop.

00:44:25.619 --> 00:44:29.619
And we will not be having our little talks anymore.

00:44:29.619 --> 00:44:32.619
That makes me very sad.

00:44:32.619 --> 00:44:35.619
But I do not want you to mourn, Andre.

00:44:35.619 --> 00:44:41.619
Rejoice that I have run the race to the finish.

00:44:41.619 --> 00:44:43.619
My young friend.

00:44:43.619 --> 00:44:50.619
I do not know what you will do with a precious life Jehovah has given you.

00:44:50.619 --> 00:44:56.619
I can only say that unless you use it to serve Jehovah,

00:44:56.619 --> 00:45:00.619
you will always feel empty.

00:45:00.619 --> 00:45:03.619
Use your life to serve him.

00:45:03.619 --> 00:45:07.619
And you will have joy and happiness.

00:45:07.619 --> 00:45:10.619
Remember the blessing of Jehovah,

00:45:10.619 --> 00:45:13.619
that is what makes rich.

00:45:13.619 --> 00:45:16.619
And he adds no pain with it.

00:45:16.619 --> 00:45:21.619
I'm confident, Andre, that you will enjoy a wonderful life in Jehovah's service.

00:45:21.619 --> 00:45:24.619
Your friend eternally, Walter Flicic.

00:45:24.619 --> 00:45:29.969
That is quite a letter, Brother Demster.

00:45:29.969 --> 00:45:32.969
How did this affect you?

00:45:32.969 --> 00:45:34.969
Well, I began to think.

00:45:34.969 --> 00:45:39.730
To really think about my future.

00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:42.730
What I should do with my life.

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:46.730
So step by step, I began rearranging my priorities.

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:49.730
Please, tell everyone here with that involved.

00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:52.730
Well, for starters, I had to quit the track team.

00:45:52.730 --> 00:45:54.730
Was that hard for you?

00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:56.730
Yes, it was.

00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:57.730
I loved running.

00:45:57.730 --> 00:46:00.730
But the pressure to win was very powerful.

00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:03.730
And I could see that the deeper I got into sports,

00:46:03.730 --> 00:46:06.730
the more compromises I might have to make.

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:12.730
But most importantly, it would interfere with my new spiritual goals.

00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:14.730
What kind of spiritual goals did you set?

00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:16.730
At first, the basics.

00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:18.730
Personal Bible study.

00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:19.730
Praying.

00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:21.730
Getting to the meetings.

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:22.730
All the meetings.

00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:25.730
And eventually getting baptized.

00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:28.730
Then my next goal was to enter the full-time ministry.

00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:31.730
I've been pioneering for four years now.

00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:33.730
Looking back, Brother Demster.

00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:38.730
Do you have any regrets over the sacrifices that you have made?

00:46:38.730 --> 00:46:40.730
Absolutely not.

00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:44.730
Just knowing I'm pleasing Jehovah, helping people study the Bible,

00:46:44.730 --> 00:46:48.730
and encouraging them to set spiritual goals.

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:51.730
There's nothing like it, Brother Taylor.

00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:55.730
Now, I've been told that another one of your goals will soon be reached.

00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:56.730
Is that true?

00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:57.730
That's right.

00:46:57.730 --> 00:47:01.730
Last week, I received my invitation to attend the next class

00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:04.730
of the ministerial training school.

00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:06.730
Thank you very much, Brother Demster.

00:47:06.730 --> 00:47:09.730
And wouldn't we like to thank all of our young pioneers

00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:11.730
for those encouraging interviews?

00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:57.170
I guess you could say I've been blessed.

00:47:57.170 --> 00:48:01.170
I've had a mother and grandmother who always encouraged me

00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:03.170
to pursue spiritual goals.

00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:07.170
And a father who has begun to show an interest in the truth.

00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:14.050
But Jehovah has also blessed me in another way,

00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:17.050
with a very special friendship.

00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:23.489
Brother Flicig helped me to discover something that changed my life.

00:48:23.489 --> 00:48:29.489
That I had something to offer Jehovah, more than I realized.

00:48:29.489 --> 00:48:36.250
Every so often, I wonder what my life would be if I had pursued other things.

00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:39.849
Would I have more money?

00:48:39.849 --> 00:48:41.849
Be famous?

00:48:41.849 --> 00:48:43.849
Maybe.

00:48:43.849 --> 00:48:47.849
But then I remember the words of a dear old friend.

00:48:47.849 --> 00:48:53.849
Unless you use your life to serve Jehovah, you will always feel empty.

00:48:53.849 --> 00:49:00.400
Well, I don't feel empty.

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:05.400
I feel fulfilled, happy, with more blessings than I could count.

00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:10.510
Oh, and I'm still running.

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:14.510
But in a different race, the race for life,

00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:19.980
that's a race I plan to keep on running in.

00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:23.980
And with Jehovah's help, it's a race I intend to win.
