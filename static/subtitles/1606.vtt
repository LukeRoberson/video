As a professor of finance I need to be well informed. As a Christian I also need to be well

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.210
informed as do all Christians. It's difficult not to take sides in politics. It's very difficult

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.929
because we are aware of the issues. I always really liked soccer. Ever since I was little I lived

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:39.329
in a poor area and soccer was what we used to do for fun. There was a journalist that I like to

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.329
keep up with. He would point out both the good and bad on all sides of politics. But when he

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:53.740
spoke up and pointed out only the bad side of a political party I did not like that. I live in the

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.259
downtown area of the city. There is where the largest political demonstrations take place. People

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:05.260
from this area are really into politics. They have definite opinions. And even though I always

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:13.620
knew that we must remain neutral I secretly approved of the demonstrations. On the outside I wasn't

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:21.299
jumping up and down or cheering but on the inside I was saying come on let's win. It was all about

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.500
the desire, the crowd, the pride of your team having the most victories or the most trophies.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.379
I used to rationalize saying I was created in Jehovah's image and Jehovah is a just God.

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:39.140
What was speaking was my sense of justice. I thought neutrality was shown through actions and not

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.939
through what I felt. The April 2016 watchtower has interesting information regarding neutrality.

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:52.099
Being neutral means that you do not consider yourself better than others. Because in God's

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:58.739
sight all people are equal. After studying the article I realized that I needed to make changes.

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:05.060
I was not being neutral so I read the article again. I prayed to Jehovah. I said to him that I

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:12.740
knew it was if he were speaking to me. The magazine really touched me deeply. I remember reading the

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:19.860
article at least three times that evening. I was really surprised. I realized how far off I was

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.939
from what God wanted me to be on the inside. The second situation mentioned in the article has to

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:31.379
do with news reports in the media. The article even suggests that we limit our intake of the news

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:37.620
that we watch related to politics. There was another phrase that really moved me. It said,

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.780
even if we don't march with protesters might we be with them in spirit? Yes, I was with them.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.180
Yes, there were several phrases in that article that were written just for me.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:58.539
When I cut back watching so many news reports and I had to, this helped me to have self-control when

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:03.580
I spoke to others at work. When workmates mentioned something that was in the news,

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.099
I didn't have anything to say since I hadn't seen it. I didn't know about it. A workmate would say,

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:14.539
did you see that so-and-so said this and that someone else made a statement? I would say,

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:20.460
no, I didn't see it. And that was the end of the conversation. The article mentions Romans 10-12,

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.340
which says that Jehovah is Lord over all of us, that there's no difference between Jew and Greek.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.340
The Jehovah, it's not important if my country has five or six titles, or if it won or lost the world cup.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.620
To Jehovah, all people are equal. I took a piece of paper, just a simple piece of paper,

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.300
and I wrote on it the four key points that the article talks about.

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:51.979
Four key points that will help us dream a neutral. I keep it in my purse, that way I can always

00:03:51.979 --> 00:04:01.870
read it at work. I like watching soccer. It's fun. I still watch it on TV. I still play soccer with

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:09.150
my friends at Bethel, but I've made an effort to change. Little by little, I've managed to put

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:16.589
soccer in its proper place. This helps me to keep pride and nationalism from getting the best of me.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.310
I learned from this article not to express opinions about politics, that has to come from deep

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.750
inside. If I'm convinced that God's kingdom is the best solution and that there's nothing that

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.350
comes even close, remaining neutral will come naturally, but I can't let my guard down.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.269
I really enjoy studying articles from the Watch Tower, especially those dealing with practical

00:04:40.269 --> 00:04:44.910
matters. They help me see the Bible as if it were a mirror. It shows me where I can improve.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.230
Following Council and making the changes suggested in the article has helped me to speak with

00:04:51.230 --> 00:05:01.790
a conviction that only the kingdom can solve mankind's problems.
