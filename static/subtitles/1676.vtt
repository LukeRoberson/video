00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:08.330
Of course, no matter what privileges we enjoy in Jehovah's organization, no one is immune

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.890
to Satan's attacks.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:17.329
That's one reason why the Apostle Paul wrote, at 1 Corinthians chapter 10 verse 12,

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:24.530
let the one who thinks he is standing beware that he does not fall.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:31.410
Penny Green is a sister who experienced the reality of those words, but she also experienced

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.530
Jehovah's loving care.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:43.619
This is her story.

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:49.780
I was raised as one of Jehovah's Witnesses by two witness parents.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:57.460
They always encouraged full-time service for all four of us children, and each of us did

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.179
enter the full-time service.

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:07.939
For me, that was that 17 that I started regular pioneering.

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:14.260
At 19 years old, I was invited by the branch to become a special pioneer, but was really

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:23.170
quite a privilege.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:31.170
No matter who you are, no matter what privileges of service you have, Paul knew what he was

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:43.579
talking about when he said, beware, because you can fall.

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:52.459
I was visited by an old friend who had developed a critical, complaining spirit.

00:01:52.459 --> 00:02:02.900
Instead of putting those thoughts out of my mind, I let it grow, and it created a downward

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:15.479
spiral in my spirituality, and then before I knew it, I was completely inactive.

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:21.000
I wasn't happy because I didn't fit in anywhere.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.520
I wasn't completely in the world, but I'd cut myself off from Jehovah's organization.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.000
I met someone who was also raised as one of Jehovah's Witnesses, so while we were both

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.939
inactive, we were married.

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:45.139
My family was so loving and patient with me.

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:53.139
They didn't try to force me through conversation or in any other way to come back to Jehovah.

00:02:53.139 --> 00:03:00.139
They were always there if I needed them, and I knew that.

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:05.259
I got a phone call from my mom saying that the district convention was going to be held

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:08.300
in Jacksonville that summer.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:15.099
She at the time lived in Atlanta, and she asked me if she came to Jacksonville to

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.099
go to the convention, would I get with her?

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:30.259
It's about a six and a half hour drive between Atlanta and Jacksonville.

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:35.219
I agreed just to make my mom happy.

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:36.219
No big deal.

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:38.219
I can do this.

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:39.219
We arrived.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:44.860
My son, Chase, was with me, and we're walking, and I'm thinking, I don't really want to

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:51.460
be here, and I don't really think I can see myself ever associating with Jehovah's

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.750
witnesses again.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:01.509
My son needed to be occupied, so a lot of my time was spent on him.

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:07.270
That was an easy way out for me to not have to pay full attention to the program, but

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:13.139
at the same time, part of me must have been listening.

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.780
It was a demonstration.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.939
The publisher made a simple statement.

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:23.100
She said, have you ever wondered what the earth would be like?

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:31.139
If that kingdom that we pray for really came, and it was like someone flipped a switch,

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:35.930
it felt a change in my heart.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:42.209
At that point, I knew that nothing else mattered.

00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:48.810
Anything that I had been critical of before didn't matter, because the kingdom was really

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.610
going to come, and it was really going to make the earth a paradise.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.889
The following week, I attended a meeting.

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:05.290
Amazingly, after being away for seven years, it felt very comfortable.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.490
It really did feel like going home.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.689
My family and friends just encouraged me.

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:17.250
They never made me feel ostracized.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.290
They never made me feel guilty.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:27.769
It was almost like picking up where I left off and moving forward, and that's how they

00:05:27.769 --> 00:05:29.250
wanted me to feel.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.050
I think it's how Jehovah wants us to feel.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.449
My life now, I'm able to pioneer again.

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:43.410
My husband, now we serve Jehovah together.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:48.269
We absolutely love being in the Hindi group.

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:52.509
My children, they both started pioneering at young ages.

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:58.550
My son, he is a Bethelite at Warwick, and my daughter, she and her husband served in

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.350
the Dominican Republic.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.709
My mom is a regular pioneer.

00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:04.589
She's 94 years old.

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:09.949
She continues to be an outstanding example for all of us.

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:20.420
My life now is truly happy, and it's all because of Jehovah.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:25.420
Brother and sister Greene still live in the state of Florida in the United States, and

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.939
Brother Greene serves as an elder in their local congregation.
