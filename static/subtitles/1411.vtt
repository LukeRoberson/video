00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:14.619
Hi, I'm Marcelo and this is Iron Sharpen's Iron.

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.620
So we've made the initial call and it went really well.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.859
We were able to share a scripture, we had a nice conversation and we even left the person

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:26.019
with a question.

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:32.060
But then we have to make what for some brothers and sisters is somewhat difficult, the dreaded

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.859
return visit.

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:37.729
But why do some of us feel that way?

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:44.530
Well, we might worry thinking, I tried to return quickly, but they weren't there.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.170
So will they even remember me?

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.049
Will they still be interested?

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:53.409
Will they ask me a question I'm not prepared for?

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:59.649
All of these might be legitimate concerns, but we need to remember that our go at this

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.209
moment is just to continue a conversation.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:07.689
It's better to focus on what we do know.

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:16.969
This person's already shown interest, remembering that can help minimize uneasiness.

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:22.489
But let's also look at three practical steps that give us the best chance for a successful

00:01:22.489 --> 00:01:24.090
return visit.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.129
The first step is be warm and friendly.

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:32.930
So focus on just getting yourself relaxed, that way you can be warm and friendly when you

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.930
greet them.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.849
It's natural for some of us to feel a measure of anxiety, conversing with someone we don't

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:41.849
know well.

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:48.689
But if we've prepared well ahead of time, we can now take a deep breath, focus on the

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.730
value of the message and smile.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.849
This can help us to relax, and often our smile is contagious.

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:57.170
I'm Laura.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.209
The last time I was here, we talked about who controls the world.

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:02.530
Yes, I remember.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.489
You even showed me it is the devil, right?

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:06.769
Yeah, that's right.

00:02:06.769 --> 00:02:10.490
If you have a few minutes, I wanted to answer the question that I left with you last

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:11.490
time.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.490
Why does God allow suffering?

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.610
Did you notice how she didn't put the householder on the spot?

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.409
She reminded the woman of her name and also the topic they had discussed on the initial

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:23.409
call.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:28.210
Now, she can continue her discussion right where she left off.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.210
God allow suffering.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:35.289
I'm kind of busy right now, but do you mind if I ask you a question?

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:40.370
Now, this is the moment we sometimes fear most.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.530
We plan to continue the discussion, but the householder has an unexpected question.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.810
So, here's one approach that works well if we would like to have more time to prepare

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.810
a response.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.770
I'd like to know if the Bible says anything about gay marriage.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.169
You know, that's a really good question.

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:08.370
Well, in a way, it does talk about that, but would it be okay with you if I answered this

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.370
other question first?

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.370
Then I can do some research and find the best possible scriptures to be able to answer

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.370
your question next time that I come.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.370
Does that sound okay?

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.370
Sure.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.370
That's fine.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.009
Did you see how our sister just gave an honest response?

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:27.770
We can simply ask if it would be okay to continue our current discussion so we can do some

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.569
research and return with a better answer.

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.210
Most householders will appreciate that.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:41.169
But if the question isn't too difficult or we feel comfortable giving a response, that's

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:42.169
fine.

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:44.330
We can always adapt.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:52.289
The idea is to try to continue our discussion, but if necessary, we can always adjust it.

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:55.050
And here's our last tip.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.969
Give them wanting more.

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:03.009
Make sure to keep our visit brief and leave them wanting more.

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:05.210
What approach can we use?

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.849
Set up a question for the next visit.

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.250
Huh, that's interesting.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.650
So this thought leads us to another question.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.649
If God allows suffering to happen, when will He put an end to it?

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:18.649
That's a good question.

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:23.529
But since I mentioned I would be brief, could I maybe come back Saturday?

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:26.889
Then I can answer this question and also the other one you asked.

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.050
Yeah, that would be great.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.290
There it is.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:36.209
Three easy steps that can help us be more comfortable and also help us make successful

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:37.930
return visits.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.850
Be warm and friendly, continue our discussion and leave them wanting more.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:49.810
I know these tips have helped me and I sure hope they help you as we work together to sharpen

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:50.490
one another.
