00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:13.900
really thought that this was behind me. I haven't smoked in nearly a year, but every day at lunch,

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:34.560
this happens. And the cravings get so intense. But maybe this is just a symptom of other areas in

00:01:34.560 --> 00:02:00.480
my life where I haven't been as focused as I should be. I keep thinking about the scripture at

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:09.199
1 Corinthians 9 verse 25. Now everyone competing in a contest exercises self-control in all things.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.319
If I'm going to continue to exercise control with this, I need to be exercising it in other areas too,

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.960
which means getting back to a good spiritual routine.
