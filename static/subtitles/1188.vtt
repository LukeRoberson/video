00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:10.679
My wife Elizabeth and I emigrated to Europe in 2006, because of their economic situation

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.810
and civil war in Angola.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:23.129
We were very poor in Angola, we had nothing to eat, sometimes we spent several days starving

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:26.910
with nothing to eat.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.429
Despite everything, we were happy.

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:37.229
We never had the desire to immigrate, we'd rather have stayed in Angola.

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:44.509
There's a big difference between the African and European culture.

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:50.469
When we arrived in France, we quickly saw the danger we could face.

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.350
It was easier to have a spiritual routine in Angola.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.439
Many things can distract us from our spiritual routine today.

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:07.730
If we're not careful, modern technology can draw us away from Jehovah.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:14.170
Despite our simple life, we strive to be generous and to teach our daughters to be generous

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.819
and hospitable.

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:22.260
We can do small things to help others.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.140
We just want to show our brothers how much we love them.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.019
The lying on Jehovah for all our needs and showing love to our neighbours is the most

00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:33.980
beautiful answer to poverty.
