00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:07.339
Now, this word picture of someone being stumbled is quite vivid, isn't it?

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:09.419
We've all seen someone stumbled.

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:16.820
In fact, we've all stumbled ourselves at times, and there are varying degrees of consequences.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:23.859
For example, a person can stumble, quickly recover, and continue almost uneventfully down

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:25.500
the path.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.740
There are a person can stumble, fall, break a bone, eventually they recover, but only

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.299
after extensive therapy.

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:44.259
Then again, a person can stumble, fall, hit his head, never recover, becoming a casualty.

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:49.219
Well the situation is similar when one is stumbled spiritually.

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:56.700
We can recover quickly, maybe recover over time, or he may never recover, becoming a

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.219
spiritual casualty.

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.859
So we can not know the ultimate outcome for someone who is stumbled.

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:11.739
So no wonder we're cautioned to be very careful to never be any cause for stumbling.

00:01:11.739 --> 00:01:19.579
Turn up to Matthew chapter 18, and here's an especially powerful scripture in this regard.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:25.819
Matthew 18 verse 6, Jesus says, but whoever stumbles one of these little ones who have faith

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:32.099
in me, it would be better for him to have hung around his neck a millstone that is turned

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:38.420
by a donkey and a bee sunk in the open sea.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:45.980
Well with graphic language, Jesus describes how that if we cause someone to become a spiritual

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.620
casualty, we could actually bring eternal doom upon ourselves.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.500
But now here's a question, what could we do to cause someone to stumble?

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.099
Well interestingly there are several similarities between causing someone to stumble physically

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:06.019
and causing someone to stumble spiritually.

00:02:06.019 --> 00:02:08.379
Let us discuss three.

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:15.699
Now one, pushing someone could cause them to stumble, especially if they're on uneven

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:18.300
terrain if you think about it.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.460
And this is true physically, spiritually.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.699
But think about Jehovah for a moment, he could push any of us, couldn't he?

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:28.900
He could force us to serve him.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.740
He certainly has the power, but he never uses it that way.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.900
Instead he invites, he encourages.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.620
And he explains the blessings, the curses, depending upon how we decide.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.180
But it's up to us, isn't it?

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:51.419
For example, Isaiah 48, 18, Jehovah says, if only you would pay attention to my commandments,

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:58.500
then your peace would become like a river and your righteousness like the waves of the

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.740
sea.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.099
He's teaching, but not forcing.

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.699
Now think about it, if Jehovah doesn't force, he doesn't want us to force either, does

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:07.699
he?

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:13.219
For example, parents need to be very careful, they don't just simply push their children

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:14.939
to serve Jehovah.

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:21.099
But rather lovingly, besiegingly like Jehovah, try to reach the heart, and of course clearly

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:26.099
show them the blessings that will come their way if they do.

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.580
Another example, elders, should never try to push Jehovah's

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.580
sheet.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.300
I heard an experience about an elder during his part, asked the brothers for a show of

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.099
hands how many were going out in service the next morning.

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.419
Well, only a few raised their hand.

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:47.340
He proceeded to scold the congregation that more should be going out.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.900
Well, he then unwisely asked for another show of hands.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.060
You guessed it, fewer raised their hand the second time.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.340
Now take another example.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.939
Those who conduct Bible studies, should not just try to push their students to do the right

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:04.939
thing.

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:08.099
You've got to quit smoking, you've got to get rid of those idols.

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:13.860
No, not with external pressure, but by motivating their hearts.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.420
You motivate your students.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.420
Or take another example.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:24.699
None of us should try to push schoolmates, workmates, relatives to accept the truth.

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:30.899
A pushing approach, shoving approach, even though motivated with sincerity has actually

00:04:30.899 --> 00:04:34.939
resulted in people being stumbled away from the truth for many years.

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:40.860
Makes me think of the story, are they saying that when a person first learns the truth,

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.420
you should lock them up for about six months to contain or minimize the damage they do.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.860
Well, that's saying it's totally erroneous.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.060
You shouldn't lock that brother up.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.060
You should follow that brother.

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:55.899
See, that brother has zeal, doesn't?

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:56.899
But it's true.

00:04:56.899 --> 00:05:02.300
We probably do need to help him to properly channel that zeal so that he doesn't try to force

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:08.779
his relatives or others to accept the truth that he is so excited about.

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:17.620
But now, what is the second thing we can do to cause someone to stumble, placing an obstacle

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.019
in their path?

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.259
Again, this is true physically or spiritually.

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:29.019
And if you think about it, whether we put that stumbling block there intentionally or

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:32.579
unintentionally, the results is the same, isn't?

00:05:32.579 --> 00:05:38.420
As mentioned in today's Watchtower comments, wholesome speech and upright conduct can help

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.819
us to avoid ever being a cause for stumbling.

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:45.819
In contrast, unwholesome speech.

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:51.180
Stumbling conduct can easily stumble ones inside or outside the congregation.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.819
But now, what about in an area where we have a scriptural right to do something?

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:02.500
Now surely exercising that right, if it's stumble someone, we can't be held accountable

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.180
for that, can we?

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.620
We'll open up to 1 Corinthians chapter 8.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:13.100
And here very interestingly, this scripture answers that question.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.740
1 Corinthians chapter 8 verse 9.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:25.660
It says, but keep watching that your right to choose does not somehow become a stumbling

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.220
block to those who are weak.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:34.180
In that interesting, even our right to choose, if it would stumble someone, we wouldn't

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.259
exercise that right according to the scripture.

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:42.220
The Apostle Paul in verse 13 of that same chapter, he said he wouldn't even eat meat

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.220
ever again if it stumbled his brother.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:53.060
Well like Paul, are we willing to forego our rights regarding, for example, wearing a beard,

00:06:53.060 --> 00:07:00.620
wearing heavy makeup, using alcohol as just a few examples, if exercising that right

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.420
might even possibly stumble somewhat?

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:11.139
But now, what's the third way we could cause someone to stumble, failing to warn him

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:13.860
about a potential trip hazard?

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.500
We could call this a sin of omission.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.980
And again, it applies physically and spiritually.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:25.339
As a physical example, let's say we see the floor has just been mocked.

00:07:25.339 --> 00:07:30.699
And an unsuspecting person is approaching that wet area.

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:32.620
Now will we warn them?

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:38.540
If we don't warn them, they fall, hurt themselves, would we not share some responsibility?

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:46.300
Well, similarly, with spiritual application, Galatians chapter 6, verse 1, tells us that

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:52.100
if someone takes a fall step before he's aware of it, what are we supposed to try to do?

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.819
Try to readjust such a person.

00:07:54.819 --> 00:07:58.740
But then it adds in a spirit of myeleness, don't push him.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:04.660
But try to gently, lovingly warn and readjust that person.

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:11.220
So there we have three areas in which we must be careful we never contribute toward someone

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.980
being stumbled.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.740
We don't push others to serve Jehovah.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:23.779
We strive to never even unintentionally put a stumbling block in their path, for example,

00:08:23.779 --> 00:08:27.819
by insisting on exercising our personal rights.

00:08:27.819 --> 00:08:35.580
And number three, we never fail to lovingly warn one whom we see approaching a potential

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.940
trip hazard.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:44.139
Rather than being any cause for stumbling, we want to be a force for good, don't we?

00:08:44.139 --> 00:08:49.460
Helping others to stand firm and even helping ones get up if they have fallen.
