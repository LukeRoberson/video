00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:09.539
One of the most precious gifts we enjoy as humans is the gift of sight.

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:16.500
Sight is possible because of the way our eyes and our brain work together.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.300
The complexity of our eyes and their connectivity with our brain gives strong evidence of a very

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.100
wise designer.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.020
And that designer is clearly identified for us in the Bible.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:38.259
Please open your Bibles to the Book of Psalms, and we're going to look at Psalm 94 verse

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:40.259
9.

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:42.579
It reads this way,

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.259
The one who made the ear, can he not hear?

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:51.380
The one who formed the eye, can he not see?

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:58.299
So Jehovah created the eye and our ability to see, and we're very grateful for that.

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:02.939
But he didn't make it just though that we see in one color just so that we can move around

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:06.939
and work and function safely and efficiently.

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:14.260
He gave us the ability to see a wide variety of colors that enrich our lives.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:22.090
We very much appreciate the brilliant colors of butterflies, birds, fishes, and flowers.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.810
What is your favorite color?

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.049
Is it red, blue, green?

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.769
Oh, you may say you've only given me three choices.

00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:33.969
That's true.

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:38.569
How many color possibilities are there that we can see?

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:44.730
And how do our eyes and our brain work together to produce this variety of colors?

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.290
And what role does light play in this process?

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.409
These questions will be answered in the following video,

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.409
and please take note how all of this wonderful design by Jehovah reassures us

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.340
that our Creator wants us to rejoice.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.810
What is color?

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:18.150
It's how we perceive wavelengths of light.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.509
Objects that reflect all the wavelengths of visible light appear white.

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:30.580
When an object reflects only some wavelengths, we see color.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:37.379
Cells in our eye detect light and send signals to our brain.

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.780
We have three kinds of color sensing cells.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:51.300
Those that detect red, green, and blue.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.099
How do we perceive other colors?

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:04.330
Mixing red, green, and blue light changes the color we see.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:11.250
This flower is yellow because it reflects red and green light into our eye.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:21.699
With just three kinds of color receptors, we can distinguish some 10 million colors.

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:25.740
Color triggers our emotions.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.659
Blue and green can calm us.

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:33.460
Red and orange can excite.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.580
In the Bible, descriptions that include color help us learn.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:47.530
Is there any doubt that God gave us the gift of color for our joy?

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.530
I put my rainbow in the cloud,

00:03:50.530 --> 00:04:03.000
and it will serve as a sign of the covenant between me and the earth.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.879
How grateful we are that Jehovah gave us this ability to see a variety of colors.

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:13.840
And color has an impact on our emotions.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.120
For example, the color red.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.560
It's a very high visible color, and it's filled with energy.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.680
Sometimes it's associated with danger.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.800
And red, it said, can actually make us breathe faster and even raise our blood pressure.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.160
But on the other hand, green is a very calming color.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.199
It's very tranquil.

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:44.720
And that's why when we look at a beautiful green garden or beautiful hillside,

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.360
why we feel very relaxed.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.279
Besides affecting our emotions,

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:57.040
Jehovah has used color in the scriptures to teach us Bible truths

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.639
and to help us remember them.

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:05.040
To illustrate, what do you think of when I mentioned the following?

00:05:05.079 --> 00:05:12.199
A white horse, a red horse, a black horse, a pale horse.

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:16.600
Well, right away your minds went to the book of Revelation, didn't they?

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.199
And you understand what these four horses picture.

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:28.439
The white horse pictures Jesus Christ as the enthroned king riding in righteous warfare.

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:34.680
The red horse picturing the bloody warfare among the nations in these last days.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:42.600
The black horse, Stark famine, and the pale horse, we're quite familiar with these days, aren't we?

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:49.560
Pale horse pictures dreaded disease at pandemics leading to death.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:57.680
So we see how Jehovah used color to teach us Bible truths and to help us remember them.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:04.519
There's another way that Jehovah has used scriptures and color to teach us about him.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.560
An example of this is an Ezekiel chapter 1 verses 26 through 28,

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:16.680
where Jehovah gives Ezekiel a beautiful, brilliant view of his throne.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.079
And among all this glory, there is a beautiful rainbow.

00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:24.680
And what does a rainbow picture?

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:32.279
The rainbow denotes peacefulness, calmness, tranquility, indicating what?

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:38.319
That with all of his dynamic energy, Jehovah is a calm, peaceful God.

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:44.470
And that's very reassuring to us, and we are endeared to him.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:49.629
Now, earlier, we talked about the association of light with color.

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:58.750
And in the scriptures, Jehovah uses light to depict something about how he increases our understanding of Bible truths.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.149
At Proverbs 418, the Bible says,

00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:10.709
But the path of the righteous is like the bright morning light that grows brighter and brighter until full daylight.

00:07:10.709 --> 00:07:15.750
Now, this applies spiritually, but we can understand it literally, can't we?

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:20.990
If you're taking an early morning walk in a countryside and the sun has not come up yet,

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:25.110
you could see things, but you're not quite sure what you see.

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:27.870
It props you don't even know what color they are.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.910
But when the sun comes up, well, you see clearly what you were looking at.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:37.589
A beautiful white fence, a green pasture, and a big, stately red barn in the distance.

00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:42.189
And now, your appreciation for your walk has been enhanced.

00:07:42.189 --> 00:07:48.110
Well, likewise, the Bible tells us at Sec. Corinthians 4.6,

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:57.470
Let the light shine out of darkness, and he has shown on our hearts to illuminate them with the glorious knowledge of God.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:07.670
Jehovah provides his servants with spiritual lightenment, and that helps us to understand and deeply appreciate Bible truths even more.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:16.670
And as a result, we understand them, we're motivated to apply them, and it draws us closer to our Heavenly Father.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:23.189
Well, how thankful we are that Jehovah created us with the ability to see color.

00:08:23.189 --> 00:08:27.230
It enriches our lives, touches our emotions,

00:08:27.269 --> 00:08:32.669
helps us to learn and remember Bible truths, helps us to understand our Heavenly Father better,

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:39.669
and the light that He provides gives us a progressive improvement in our Bible understanding.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:44.549
How thankful we are for the gift that Jehovah has given us to see color.

00:08:44.549 --> 00:08:52.669
It is a strong evidence that He really wants us to enjoy life to the full.

00:08:52.669 --> 00:09:00.429
And now, let's give our attention to Brother Robert Lucioni, who will now present the next talk of this symposium.

00:09:00.429 --> 00:09:06.590
Creation proves that Jehovah wants us to rejoice our well-designed bodies.
