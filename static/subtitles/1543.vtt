00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:15.039
We're very happy for Daniel.

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:26.410
He's going to be a blessing in his new assignment, but we're going to miss him.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.129
And everything he was doing for the congregation.

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:41.210
This will change things for us.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:01:17.709
We really want to be there for our brothers and sisters, and it's true having plenty to

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:20.829
do in the Lord's work is good.

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:30.650
But where will we get more help?

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:43.819
We do have good ministerial servants, like Ritchie, but after Daniel left, our older

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:46.340
body is one fewer now.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.859
That prompted a good question.

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:59.950
Are we doing all we can to train our brothers?

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.189
Ritchie, do you have some time for me?

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.670
I have some calls you can help me with.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:12.419
Sure, I'd like that.

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:17.180
He realized it had been a while since we talked about him qualifying to do more.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.379
He explained he wanted to help, but didn't want to appear presumptuous.

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.979
He'd been praying about it, and he wanted to know what else he could do to keep reaching

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.979
out.

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:32.580
Talking to Ritchie made me think of Jesus' example.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.139
His disciples offered themselves willingly, and he trained them.

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:40.099
They were eager, but needed his direction.

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:47.280
Jesus' training gave them confidence to do the assignments he gave them.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.039
They were happy.

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:54.560
Not just to follow Jesus, but to work alongside him.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.120
And Jesus was happy to share his work.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.319
Up to his final evening with them, he prepared them for the work ahead.

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:09.240
Most truly I say to you, whoever exercises faith in me will also do the works that I

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:17.889
do, and he will do works greater than these, because I am going my way to the Father.

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:30.919
I now remember how much training I had received from the brothers.

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:43.509
It was easy to forget that I didn't always get things right at first.

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:52.590
Soon Ritchie was taken on more responsibility, and he told me something that I too once felt.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:59.979
He just didn't realize how much work went into caring for Jehovah's sheep, but once

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:04.099
he knew, he was glad he offered himself willingly.
