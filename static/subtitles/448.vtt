00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:04.790
How strong is your core?

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.109
Now health experts will tell you that the core is one of the most important group of

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:11.509
muscles that you can strengthen.

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:14.669
These are the muscles that are in the trunk of the body from somewhere around the neck

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:16.550
to the waist.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.750
And a strong core will keep you standing if something knocks against you.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.829
Having a strong core will allow you to carry a heavy weight.

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:31.070
And if you fall, a strong core will help you to get back up on your feet.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.789
So thus experts say that exercises that strengthen the core, these foundational muscles

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:40.270
are so important, especially for older people.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.909
So how strong is your core?

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:50.189
But the real question we want to consider today is how strong is your spiritual core?

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:53.229
Are spiritual foundational muscles?

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:57.469
Now we see the importance of having a strong spiritual core when we look at today's

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:58.469
sex.

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.430
In 2 Timothy chapter 3, if you look up in verse 6 here, the apostle Paul is talking about

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.349
wicked men who slightly work their ways into households and deceive many.

00:01:09.349 --> 00:01:13.750
At verse 8, he talks about Janice and Jambri's who opposed Moses.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.189
These were wicked men, completely corrupted in mind, who tried to discredit everything

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:21.189
that Moses said and did.

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:26.069
And then as we see in today's text, Paul said that wicked men and imposters would arise

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:30.829
in the last days and they would advance from bad to worse.

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.390
Well what did Paul say would help Timothy?

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.590
What did he need to do?

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.989
He needed a strong spiritual core.

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:39.310
What was that?

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.870
Well look at what he says in verses 14 and 15, 2 Timothy 3.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.069
He says, you, however, continue in the things that you learned and were persuaded to believe,

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:56.030
knowing from whom you learned them and that from infancy you have known the holy writings,

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.349
which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:01.989
Do you see the two things?

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:07.469
And number one is he needed to have a deep understanding and trust of the holy writings,

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:13.990
the scriptures, and two, he needed to never forget to remember from whom he learned all

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.590
the good things that he knew.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.990
So he needed to make sure that was solid.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.789
That would help him to deal with the wicked men and imposters.

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:30.150
Now this solid spiritual foundation is what also helped Jesus apostles.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.030
You think about the tactics that the wicked men and imposters used against Jesus and

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.629
how this could have affected the apostles or affected us if we had been there.

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.789
Let's consider four tactics that they used against Jesus.

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:47.150
Number one, they used lies and misrepresentation.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.349
Turn back if you will to Matthew, chapter 11, verse 9 is an example.

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:59.310
Matthew 1119, excuse me, Matthew 1119, it says, the son of man did come eating and drinking,

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.550
but people say, look, a man who is a glutton, who's given to drinking wine, a friend of tax

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.310
collectors and sinners.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.789
Now did Jesus like to eat and drink?

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:11.789
Yes.

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:15.430
Did he, in fact, eat with tax collectors and sinners?

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.750
Yes.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.830
But do you know what the wicked men and imposters, they stretched it to say, well, you see because

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.990
he's a glutton, he's a drunkard, he is a friend of tax collectors and sinners.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.349
You look at Luke chapter 15 and verse 2, he even kind of insinuates that he condones their

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.669
behavior, maybe even he shares in their sins.

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:37.389
What if you were there?

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:42.789
Now we know he liked to eat and drink, but I'm not with him 24 hours a day, I hope that's

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:44.310
not true.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.069
Can you see how that could plant seeds of doubt, how it could rock somebody?

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.069
Second tactic, wicked men and imposters would also twist Jesus words.

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.349
Look at John chapter 5 and verse 18 as an example.

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:03.909
John chapter 5 and verse 18, and he says, this is why the Jews began seeking all the more

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:08.990
to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was also calling God

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.189
his own father, making him equal to God.

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:18.149
So here they twist Jesus words, saying that Jesus was saying he was equal to, Jesus never

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:19.910
said he was equal to God.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.709
He said that he was God's son, he says the father is greater than I am, but they constantly

00:04:24.709 --> 00:04:30.230
took Jesus words, repackaged them, twisting them to make it sound like Jesus was off on

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:31.709
his own.

00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:35.110
Now what if you heard that story told and retooled?

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.350
You didn't hear the conversation, but you heard the story, you heard the sound bite.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.430
Wow, did he really say that?

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.310
Now that would be out of line if he had, because nobody's equal to God.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.949
They also capitalized on errors that were made.

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.269
Look over to Luke chapter 9.

00:04:52.269 --> 00:04:56.709
You remember this is the account when the disciples could not cast out the demon of the

00:04:56.709 --> 00:05:02.829
young man, and you look at verse 40 here, the father says, Luke 9.40, he says, I begged

00:05:02.829 --> 00:05:06.149
your disciples to expel it, but they could not.

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:11.550
In response, Jesus said, oh, faithless and twisted generation, how long must I continue

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.550
with you and put up with you?

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.470
Bring your son over here.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.230
Now as we know, apparently the scribes were criticizing the disciples because of their

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.230
failure to heal the boy.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.189
Now again, what if you were standing there?

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:25.269
What if you saw this one with your own eyes?

00:05:25.269 --> 00:05:28.470
Wait a minute, those are Jesus' disciples.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:29.709
That's their commission.

00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:31.910
That's what they're supposed to do.

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.269
Perhaps these people aren't as special as I thought they were.

00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:40.069
Wicked men and imposter would also inflame statements that people did not understand.

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:46.029
Look at Luke, excuse me, John, chapter 6, and verse 54.

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:51.310
You remember here when Jesus said, whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.310
life, and I will resurrect him in the last day.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.310
What was the reaction?

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.149
You look at verse 60.

00:05:57.149 --> 00:06:00.509
When they heard this many of the disciples said this speech is shocking.

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:01.509
Who can listen to it?

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:06.389
Verse 66, they went off to things behind and would no longer follow him.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.269
See rather than giving it time to see if they understood it correctly, waiting to see

00:06:11.269 --> 00:06:15.430
if maybe Jesus clarified the statement, it knocked them.

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:20.949
And you notice in verse 52, the Jews further stirred this up, and because of that many stopped

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:21.949
following him.

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:24.990
It was too heavy for them to carry.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:30.949
Now what if you were there, and this time you heard Jesus say that, whoa, man, that's

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:31.949
odd.

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:34.230
I don't think I can explain that teaching.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.629
He seems to be getting more and more extreme.

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:40.350
Well how did many react to these attacks?

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.110
Well the crowds, they loved to follow Jesus.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.589
They loved to hear his winsome words, no man's ever spoken like this.

00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:51.910
Thousands would come to be fed by him, to be healed by him.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.149
But in the end, most did not stick with Jesus.

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:56.629
Why?

00:06:56.629 --> 00:07:01.870
Well because when you strip all the other peripherals away, all the other extras away,

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:08.750
they came down to their faith in Bible prophecy, and that this man that was speaking to them

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.350
was the Son of God.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.949
Their spiritual core was not strong enough.

00:07:14.949 --> 00:07:17.670
Now Jesus' disciples had a strong spiritual core.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:21.029
See even though they did get knocked down, they got confused at times.

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:22.029
They stayed solid.

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:23.350
They were able to get back up.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:24.350
Why?

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:29.509
Because they recalled the scriptures and they were convinced that they were listening

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:32.069
to the Son of God.

00:07:32.069 --> 00:07:37.670
Well today wicked men in imposter's use exactly the same techniques, and it's only going

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:38.949
to get worse.

00:07:38.949 --> 00:07:42.069
They use lies and misrepresentation.

00:07:42.069 --> 00:07:47.389
They lie about how we deal with child abusers, how we care for the victims of child abuse.

00:07:47.389 --> 00:07:52.709
They twist statements that are made regarding our stand on blood, loyalty to families,

00:07:52.709 --> 00:07:53.709
disfellowshipping.

00:07:53.709 --> 00:07:56.750
They capitalize on what they perceive as errors.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:02.389
They have dogmatic statements we made in the past regarding a Bible prophecy or understanding

00:08:02.389 --> 00:08:06.269
of the time of the end, and then we later changed it.

00:08:06.269 --> 00:08:10.470
They also put a negative spin on changes that they do not understand.

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:16.829
They say why we simplified, did reassignments in 2015, and new explanations of the generation

00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:19.470
changes at world headquarters.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:20.470
What's the result?

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:21.990
Well some are swayed by these things.

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:22.990
They're stumbled.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:23.990
They're knocked down.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:27.189
It's too heavy for them to carry.

00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:28.790
How about us?

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:32.029
How strong is our spiritual core?

00:08:32.029 --> 00:08:39.629
See, that's why we here repeatedly that we must personally have a regular, deep study

00:08:39.629 --> 00:08:41.269
of the Scriptures.

00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:46.710
That's why we're reminded repeatedly that Jehovah is using the governing body to give

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:48.870
us the good things that we have.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.389
Now, why is that so important?

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:57.470
Well, because one day we may hit a time where they're personally in our personal life or

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:04.710
as an organization when all the other spiritual peripherals are gone, all the extras.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.429
What do we do then?

00:09:06.429 --> 00:09:11.669
What do we do, for example, if the lights go out on broadcasting?

00:09:11.669 --> 00:09:17.029
What happens perhaps when we don't have the incredible conventions, the touching videos,

00:09:17.029 --> 00:09:21.509
the catchy music that beautifully written, well-written, watched our articles, the exciting

00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:22.909
annual meetings.

00:09:22.909 --> 00:09:23.909
They're gone.

00:09:23.909 --> 00:09:28.509
See some of our brothers and sisters do not have access to those things right now.

00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:34.070
We see at that time, it will come down to our faith that this is God's Word, and the

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:38.870
governing body is the channel that Jehovah has been using.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:43.909
So during this period of relative calm, may we follow the advice of the Apostle Paul

00:09:43.909 --> 00:09:47.190
and 2 Timothy 3, 14, and 15?

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:53.029
Know the holy writings inside and out, and remember from whom we've learned all the

00:09:53.029 --> 00:09:55.309
good things that we know.

00:09:55.309 --> 00:09:56.950
That's our spiritual core.

00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:01.309
Strengthen it, maintain it, it will stabilize us, and it will help us to get through the

00:10:01.309 --> 00:10:02.590
things that are yet to come.
