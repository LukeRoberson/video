00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:16.789
Hi, I am Michalis and this is Iron Sharpen's Iron.

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.030
One challenge that often makes me nervous is when I've prepared an introduction, I've

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:30.190
planned the conversation, but the householder doesn't follow the plan and I have to adapt.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.590
Have you ever had that experience?

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.189
This could mean that what we prepared just won't work.

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:45.350
So we're going to discuss four tips that have helped me and hopefully will help you be

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.270
more adaptable.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:01:00.850
The four tips are one, know your territory, two, make use of the teaching toolbox, three,

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:09.650
anticipate common objections or questions and four, be flexible adjust to the householder's

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:20.620
needs because remember this is meant to be a conversation, not a sermon or a sales pitch.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:31.859
Now let's look at a situation where applying these four suggestions can help.

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:34.140
So what introduction are you using?

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.140
I thought I would talk about economic problems.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.260
Hmm, good idea and it really suits the territory, thanks.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.579
I'll read Isaiah 65-21-23 and then offer the kingdom tract.

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.340
Perfect, I'll get the scripture ready.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:02:01.750
Excellent.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.590
Good morning.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.469
Many people in our area struggle to make ends meet.

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.909
Do you think there will ever be a time when we won't have to stress about money?

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:14.949
Actually, now isn't a good time.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.870
I just received some bad news.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.750
I'm sorry.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.430
We'll come back another time then.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:28.250
Thank you.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.090
Okay, our sister applied our first two tips really well.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.969
But our sisters are usually excellent when it comes to the ministry.

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:41.009
So no real surprises there.

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:42.370
Did you notice?

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:50.370
First, she knew her territory well and had a presentation designed specifically for it.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.050
Second, her scripture and talking point were taken from the tract,

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.729
what is the kingdom of God?

00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:02.569
Which as you know, is part of our teaching toolbox.

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.250
However, when the householder had something else on her mind,

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.810
our sister opted to return later.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.129
That could be a good decision in this kind of situation.

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.930
But let's see what would happen.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:27.039
If she were to ask just one more question and adapt according to the householder's response.

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:30.120
Actually, now isn't a good time.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.039
I just received some bad news.

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:34.479
I'm sorry.

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:37.680
Is there anything we can do to help?

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.680
No.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.159
I just heard my sister's cancer.

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:49.039
Oh, that must be so difficult for your sister

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:50.680
and for you.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.400
Yes, when someone we love is suffering, we can often feel helpless.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.560
That's exactly how I feel.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.960
If you have a moment, could I show you something that I find comforting

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.000
about a time in the near future when our loved ones will never suffer again?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.719
Hmm, I'd like that.

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:12.960
Notice what the Bible says at Revelation 21 verses 3 and 4.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:19.610
With that, I heard a loud voice from the Throne saying,

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:29.050
wow, did you see how she was able to offer this woman real comfort just by being adaptable?

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.850
All it took was one simple question.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.569
Is there anything we can do to help?

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:40.410
She was sincere and friendly and the householder responded.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.649
At that point, our sister applied our third tip.

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:51.089
She obviously was familiar with some common anxieties of ones in that territory because

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:57.449
she smoothly transitioned to the topic of suffering, which allowed her to listen to

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:04.930
the householders' real concern and then implement our fourth tip.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.889
She adjusted to meet those needs.

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.009
Plus, she didn't struggle to find information to use.

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:16.810
She stayed right there in her teaching toolbox.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:22.970
Granted, not every situation will be as straightforward as this, and it takes time and experience

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.250
to get comfortable moving from one topic to another.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:33.170
But if we apply our four tips, know your territory.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.370
Make use of the teaching toolbox.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:44.449
Try to anticipate common objections or questions and then adjust to the householder's needs.

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:50.769
By applying these, we'll find very quickly that we're having meaningful conversations

00:05:50.769 --> 00:05:58.149
and are able to share targeted truths with those most in need.

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:04.910
As always, these are just a few techniques that have worked for me and I hope they work

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.589
for you.

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:14.509
Remember, part of the beauty of our ministry is that we continue to sharpen one another.
