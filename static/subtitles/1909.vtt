00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:04.799
Welcome to our update.

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.299
The spiritual highlight of our year,

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:09.199
the memorial of Christ death,

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:14.000
was observed by God's people on April 4, 2023.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.400
In the week's prior,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.699
Jehovah's Witnesses Unitedly extended the invitation

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.000
to this event, the world over.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.899
This was the first time since the pandemic began

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:28.199
that we could again offer invitations for the memorial

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.299
by means of the House to House and Public Ministry.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.299
No doubt, many had been able to expand their ministry

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:37.200
during this memorial season,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.500
including those who could serve as auxiliary pioneers

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.200
with the new 15-hour requirement.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.500
It's thrilling to think about the millions of brothers

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.000
and sisters and interested ones who gathered for the memorial

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.280
to show their appreciation for the gift of the ransom.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.179
When we face unexpected events or loss,

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:05.879
we are especially reminded of how vital the ransom is.

00:01:05.879 --> 00:01:06.980
As a brotherhood,

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.180
we were shocked to hear about the shooting

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.980
that occurred at a Kingdom Hall in Hamburg, Germany

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.180
in March 2023.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.379
Please note the following video update.

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:22.980
On the evening of Thursday, March 9, 2023,

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.680
a terrible tragedy happened in Hamburg, Germany

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.079
after the midweek meeting concluded.

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.180
Sadly, four brothers and two sisters

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.079
as well as an injured sister's unborn child were killed.

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.180
In addition, two brothers and seven sisters

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.879
were seriously injured.

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:46.180
We are happy to report that none of them

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.480
are in intensive care.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.980
Following the shooting,

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.180
direction was given that all meetings in Hamburg

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.680
should be held by video conference only.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.280
The Hamburg-Vinterhoody congregation deeply desired

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.079
to come together again

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.180
for in-person meetings as soon as possible.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.580
Shortly thereafter, approval was given

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.379
for all meetings to resume in person,

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.780
starting with the very next midweek meeting.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.780
Some of the injured were even able

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.879
to join the meeting from the hospital using Zoom.

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.879
The Central Europe Branch Committee

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:27.580
made immediate arrangements to give comfort and support.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.080
To bolster the relief committee which had been appointed,

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.080
branch committee members and their wives

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.080
traveled to Hamburg and accompanied

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.780
the responsible circuit overseer.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.979
Special meetings were organized to coordinate visits

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:43.379
to the affected brothers and sisters

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.780
which often meant staying at their side

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.379
literally day and night.

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:51.780
Every day, a tremendous number of letters and cards

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.979
from all over the world continue to be delivered to the hall.

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:58.879
The brothers and sisters are completely overwhelmed

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.280
and deeply touched by these expressions

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.180
of affection and fellow feeling.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.780
All congregations within the state of Hamburg

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.379
were invited to a memorial service held on Saturday,

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.780
March 25, 2023.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.680
More than 3,000 brothers and sisters attended in person

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.580
and over 90,000 connections were made to view this program

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.580
via stream, many of whom viewed the program

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.180
with friends and family.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.680
All in attendance were touched by the heartwarming words

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.680
from branch committee members

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.680
as well as the visiting governing body member and helper.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.280
This memorial service provided strong evidence

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.979
of Christian love, a convincing testimony

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:54.710
that Jehovah's people do not face such situations alone.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.710
Our brothers in Hamburg have experienced Jehovah's loyal love

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.110
throughout this very distressing situation.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.710
After attending the funeral, one sister wrote,

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.110
the commemoration for the victims in Hamburg

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.810
was most dignified and deeply moving.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.110
The profound biblical thoughts, the unadulterated truth,

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:21.009
the message of comfort, love, trust, and hope delivered

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:24.709
with such dignity, tenderness, and empathy

00:04:24.709 --> 00:04:28.209
cannot but have moved every sincere heart

00:04:28.209 --> 00:04:30.310
and has given a resounding witness

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.910
for our wonderful God, Jehovah.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.910
We have also received many expressions

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.009
of sympathy from officials, organizations,

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:41.910
and individuals from around the world.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.209
For example, the federal president of Germany

00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:49.209
said, to all of you, dear bereaved, dear friends,

00:04:49.209 --> 00:04:55.009
and companions of the victims, my sincere and deepest sympathy.

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:58.110
You have the sympathy of the people of Germany.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.310
They feel and mourn with you.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.509
They share in your suffering.

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:06.810
No doubt we all continue to keep our brothers

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.959
and sisters in Hamburg in our prayers.

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:14.959
Another recent event that's had a significant impact

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:17.759
on our brothers and sisters was Cyclone Freddie,

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:20.259
which struck East Africa.

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:24.259
In February and March, 2023, Cyclone Freddie

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:28.160
made multiple landfalls and brought strong winds,

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.560
heavy rain, and flooding.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.560
Sadly, in Malawi, eight publishers were killed

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.160
and three are currently missing.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.759
And in Mozambique, one publisher was killed

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:43.360
and one is missing.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.759
There's extensive damage in Madagascar, Malawi,

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:48.759
and Mozambique.

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:52.360
Altogether, over 7,000 publishers and their households

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.459
were displaced.

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:57.660
More than 1,400 of our brothers' homes

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.060
were damaged or destroyed and 24 kingdom halls

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.160
were damaged or destroyed.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.560
When the branch committees, circuit overseers

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.959
and local elders responded quickly

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:12.259
to provide comfort and support, along with help

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.459
for their immediate material needs.

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:19.160
Relief efforts are underway to provide humanitarian aid

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.560
and to repair or rebuild their kingdom halls and homes.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.060
This may well be the largest relief effort

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.660
that our brothers in Malawi have faced.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.060
Please keep these dear brothers and sisters

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.360
in your prayers, along with those who are working hard

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.699
to provide relief.

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:42.600
When we face trials or tragedies,

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.800
we are not the only ones who are affected.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.100
At Isaiah 63-9, it says of Jehovah

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.399
during all their distress, it was distressing to him.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.199
This assures us that Jehovah is affected too.

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:01.800
He's moved to help his faithful servants.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.199
And especially during times of distress,

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:06.399
he can become our refuge.

00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:09.399
He stands ready to help us.

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:13.500
But how can we benefit from his help and protection?

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.800
Well, the answer can be found in what we read

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.300
at Psalm 91, verse 9.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.300
It says,

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.800
because you said,

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.300
Jehovah is my refuge,

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.300
you have made the most high you're dwelling.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.800
It doesn't just say that Jehovah is our refuge,

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.600
but that we have made him our refuge.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.800
We can make Jehovah our refuge

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.800
by drawing close to him during our trials.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.500
How?

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.300
We lean on him in prayer.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.800
We keep up our good spiritual routine.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.100
We stay busy in the ministry.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.199
And we look for ways to encourage others.

00:07:56.199 --> 00:07:58.699
When we do this as individuals,

00:07:58.699 --> 00:08:01.899
we make Jehovah our refuge.

00:08:01.899 --> 00:08:04.300
Then, even when we do suffer tragedies

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.000
of one sort or another,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.399
our faith and our spiritual security

00:08:08.399 --> 00:08:10.800
will not be destroyed.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.000
And when we do this as a brotherhood,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.399
when we all turn to Jehovah in times of distress,

00:08:16.399 --> 00:08:19.300
it unites us further.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:24.620
And it gives a wonderful witness.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.519
An example of this is what our brothers experienced

00:08:27.519 --> 00:08:30.319
on Abeko Island in the Bahamas.

00:08:30.319 --> 00:08:35.320
In 2019, they suffered a category five hurricane.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.820
Hurricane Dorian destroyed the only kingdom hall

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.419
on the island and damaged or destroyed

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:43.320
16 of our brothers' homes.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.620
What did our brothers do?

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.919
They made Jehovah their refuge.

00:08:48.919 --> 00:08:52.120
They relied on him in fervent prayer.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.519
They supported one another through that trial.

00:08:55.519 --> 00:08:57.820
And as soon as it was safe to do so,

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.919
the kingdom hall was rebuilt.

00:09:00.919 --> 00:09:03.720
Recently, the kingdom hall was completed

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.919
and then dedicated in January 2023.

00:09:07.919 --> 00:09:12.809
Let's watch the following video.

00:09:12.809 --> 00:09:16.309
The sun's shining, not a cloud in the sky.

00:09:16.309 --> 00:09:19.309
We're in Abeko to dedicate this beautiful kingdom hall

00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:22.509
right here.

00:09:22.509 --> 00:09:24.809
I can't wait to be a part of this and see this

00:09:24.809 --> 00:09:26.809
and be able to sing with my brothers and sisters

00:09:26.809 --> 00:09:29.509
from the Abeko congregation and the Haitian congregation

00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:35.110
and be able to hear our voices play.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:38.610
But what a blessing from Jehovah that finally we can be here

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:48.049
for this wonderful program.

00:09:48.049 --> 00:09:50.950
Here we are three years later.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:58.500
We just didn't think that this day would actually come.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.700
I received a text message I was at home.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.980
Pray for Abeko.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:13.679
The devastation to the kingdom hall was so complete.

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:16.679
That I think is forever etched in my mind.

00:10:16.679 --> 00:10:19.279
You could see the kingdom hall chairs

00:10:19.279 --> 00:10:22.779
and the publications thrown all around.

00:10:22.779 --> 00:10:37.879
It reached your heart apart to see the kingdom hall like that.

00:10:37.879 --> 00:10:43.879
We got to the airport and it looks like

00:10:43.879 --> 00:10:47.179
there was no way out of this situation.

00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:52.379
So the brother prayed and after he prayed,

00:10:52.379 --> 00:10:57.279
it's like a window open for us to get out of there.

00:10:57.279 --> 00:10:58.879
We got to NASA.

00:10:58.879 --> 00:11:02.379
There was food, there was clothing, there was a...

00:11:02.379 --> 00:11:04.879
It seemed like we were having a convention when we landed.

00:11:04.879 --> 00:11:06.879
There were so many brothers there.

00:11:06.879 --> 00:11:23.029
Plot cards singing to the top of their voice.

00:11:23.029 --> 00:11:24.230
The operation was huge.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:27.529
We almost had about 70 or 80 individuals that come in and out.

00:11:27.529 --> 00:11:30.529
It was a mini army as it were.

00:11:30.529 --> 00:11:32.529
We were a few weeks away from what was going to be

00:11:32.529 --> 00:11:34.830
the fastest project I've ever worked on.

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:37.529
We were just absolutely finishing houses

00:11:37.529 --> 00:11:40.529
and almost record speeds.

00:11:40.529 --> 00:11:43.529
The kingdom hall was about to be ready for the memorial.

00:11:43.529 --> 00:11:46.529
So we could start to see the end.

00:11:46.529 --> 00:11:52.029
And then we got the call that COVID was putting an end to the project.

00:11:52.029 --> 00:11:55.029
And our overseer, he got on stage and within three or four words,

00:11:55.029 --> 00:11:56.029
he started crying.

00:11:56.029 --> 00:12:00.029
I mean, we knew it was because we had to leave.

00:12:00.029 --> 00:12:03.029
Sitting on that plane made me cry.

00:12:03.029 --> 00:12:08.070
Thinking I was just leaving.

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:11.070
We kept thinking when will we be able to go back?

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:19.990
I got the phone call from my overseer.

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:23.990
And we wanted to get Abigail finished up and I was thrilled.

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:33.000
I was praying for that for 15 months to go back and finish this project.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
When that herd came blue through,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
it may have taken a lot of things with it,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
but it sure didn't take your faith.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
And it sure didn't take away your relationship with God.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.500
When we got to NASA,

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:49.500
the friends sang and feeling out to us.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:54.500
And so now they landed and we sang it to them.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:08.440
It was overwhelming to listen and hear the beautiful voices of the brothers and sisters

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:12.440
singing about the love that we have amongst all of us.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:23.960
To have seen what the friends went through

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:29.460
and how their hearts can be sued to have a place of worship is such a wonderful privilege.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.460
And it was a joy to be back at the hall.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:36.460
And it felt like we were victorious once again.

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:40.460
It doesn't matter if there's 10 publishers or 10,000 publishers,

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:42.460
Jehovah is going to take care of them.

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:47.460
It has been a reunion, a piece of paradise.

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:53.950
No matter what happens to us,

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:56.950
whether it be a natural disaster or unrest or war,

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:59.950
we're always going to be there for our brothers.

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:02.950
We're going to support one another, we're going to help each other.

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.950
And we're going to be okay with Jehovah's help.

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:19.600
It's so encouraging to see our brothers and sisters back in their kingdom hall.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.600
Their love and appreciation for Jehovah and his organization is evident.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.600
And they're making good use of their kingdom hall.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.600
For this year's memorial, the 47 publishers of the two congregations

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.600
had a combined attendance of 217.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:44.620
Before we conclude, we have a new feature in JW Library that we're excited to share with you.

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:50.620
JW Library will soon support playlists in the Personal Study tab.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:57.620
With this feature, you'll be able to add videos, audio programs, and pictures to personal playlists.

00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:03.960
For example, you can make playlists of your favorite theocratic songs,

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.960
or videos to use in the ministry.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.960
You can also make a playlist of pictures to use in a talk,

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.960
and then share it with the audio video support brothers

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:17.960
so they can use JW Library to display the pictures.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:23.779
Look for an update to the app in the coming weeks.

00:15:23.779 --> 00:15:27.779
Brothers and sisters, what have we discussed?

00:15:27.779 --> 00:15:31.779
Whatever trials or tests you're dealing with personally,

00:15:31.779 --> 00:15:37.779
be assured that Jehovah sees you and is aware of what you're going through.

00:15:37.779 --> 00:15:41.779
He too is affected and is moved to help.

00:15:41.779 --> 00:15:45.779
So continue to lean on Jehovah in prayer.

00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:48.779
Keep up your good spiritual routine.

00:15:48.779 --> 00:15:54.779
Stay busy in the ministry and reach out to others for support.

00:15:54.779 --> 00:15:59.779
Yes, continue to make Jehovah your refuge.

00:15:59.779 --> 00:16:04.779
And please know that we love you all very much.

00:16:04.779 --> 00:16:09.779
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
