00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:21.179
Jehovah's people are hard at work. As our organization continues to expand, the

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:27.859
need to identify and train qualified brothers as overseers grows. The February

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:34.140
2024 study edition of the Watchtower explained, for decades the brothers of the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.100
governing body have been training men from among the other sheep to take the

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.880
lead. For example, they organize many schools to train elders, traveling

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:50.579
overseers, branch committee members, overseers at Bethel and others. In harmony

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.100
with these efforts, at the 2022 annual meeting it was announced that there

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:02.020
would be a new school, principles of divine oversight. This program would train

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.780
Bethel and construction overseers, as well as younger brothers with good

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.579
potential, to follow the divine pattern of oversight exemplified by our God

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:18.900
Jehovah and his son and our King Jesus Christ. Let's take an in-depth look at

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.700
this upbuilding course. The four and a half day curriculum includes recorded

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.140
lectures from members of the governing body and insightful comments from

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.180
seasoned overseers from around the world. It also includes 12 stimulating workshops

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.260
and these workshops allow the brothers and in-class to be able to just interact

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.579
together and have some very lively discussions. Those 12 workshops are divided

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:51.140
into three sections. Select, train, trust. So yes, while the school is aimed at

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.060
helping an overseer to improve his personal skills, he must also be able to do

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.019
those three things. He must be able to select, identify brothers who have

00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:06.099
potential for the future, train them, have a plan and implement a training plan

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:11.539
and then trust them by assigning them responsible tasks and sharing his

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:15.539
experience with them. When you get to the workshop discussions, despite that in

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:20.300
adequacy, what you see is all the brothers are feeling the same and you get an

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.939
opportunity to talk to more experienced brothers, but you see that they're

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:27.939
facing the same thing as you. So those discussions really were opportunities for

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:32.020
us to shop in each other and keep each other going. Along with engaging

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:38.300
discussions, there are 70 true-to-life videos. They provide good and not-so-good

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.460
examples of oversight and action and it covers a broad section of Bethel and

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.699
construction settings. The videos range from dealing with feelings of being

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:54.659
overwhelmed to shepherding remote volunteers and commuters to delegating like

00:02:54.659 --> 00:03:02.439
Jehovah and Jesus Christ. In addition to overseers and assistant overseers, young

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:09.280
brothers with fine potential are invited to attend as well. Why cast a wide

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.879
net to include in the school younger brothers who are not yet assigned as

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:19.879
overseers? Young brothers are being asked to take on more responsibility at a

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:25.000
younger age and rolling them in PDO. It gives them the tools that they need to

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.639
be successful in the assignments that they're given. The recommendation was for

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:34.879
overseers, for assistant overseers, of course, to be invited, but also in there,

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.879
younger brothers and experienced brothers are also asked to attend. And so you

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:44.280
have a nice mix. You have a mix of experience. You have a mix of inexperience and

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.960
what that does is it gives you a well-rounded out class and it just leads to a

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.840
good learning experience all around. Because of my limited experience at first,

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.840
I was shocked to see that I was invited, but really getting to see how Jehovah

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.280
was investing in me really encouraged me to want to put forth more effort and

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.639
try to get back to the organization. Even though customs may vary from country

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:20.000
to country, divine principles of oversight are universal, applying in every land.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.680
How have the students benefited and what have been the results at the branches?

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.720
The class helped me to appreciate that to accomplish my assignment well. It's not just about

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.600
hitting deadlines or accomplishing the work more is involved with that. It really

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.600
highlighted that Jehovah's priority was always the welfare of his people. So that

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.560
should be my priority, the people. So people couldn't be full of things like

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:51.680
efficiency or productivity. And the class taught me there are lots of things I can improve on.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.560
Things like helping the brothers and sisters to enjoy their assignment more. Things like

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.600
training and delegation. And just getting to know the brothers and sisters better, their personal

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.240
circumstances and supporting them. Because when the brothers and sisters are happy, then the work

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.000
takes care of itself. It's always been good to work with my overseer. But after you into the

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.839
PDO school, it's become even better to work with you. One thing I've noticed after the PDO

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:24.480
school is the way he handles queries. He takes time to listen to me and he listens to the words

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:31.600
that I'm saying and even the emotions that I'm showing. And then he asks, what do you think we

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:37.839
can do? I know with my overseer, I am trusted. And he values my opinion because a lot of times he

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:44.079
uses it. And even if he doesn't use it, the way he listens to me makes me feel that I'm valued.

00:05:44.079 --> 00:05:48.639
Usually for people to go learn oversight or learn management,

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:56.079
lots of books and years of studying. To put all of that into one week was really what made the

00:05:56.079 --> 00:06:03.519
school special. Seeing the priorities of a good overseer, someone who's focused on not only

00:06:03.519 --> 00:06:09.839
the work and the assignment but more focused on the people and following Jehovah's example of

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:16.800
shepherding and then training those under direct oversight. I appreciated the emphasis placed

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:23.759
on an overseer being a loving shepherd. The people are the most important resources in his

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:32.000
department. They are the only assets that Jesus died for. Brothers are able to adjust their mindset

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.800
towards their role as overseers, towards their role as shepherds, both at Bethel and the departments

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:44.240
and the congregations that they serve in. This school, it's clearly a tool that Jehovah is using

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:50.399
to help us not just to fulfill our responsibilities right now or today, but it's a tool that Jehovah is

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:54.480
going to continue to use into the new world as we fulfill our responsibilities then.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:02.160
Blessings are not only seen in individual departments, but radiate outward bringing

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:09.040
refreshment to the branches and spreading to the entire brotherhood. Jehovah promised at Isaiah 60

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:18.000
verse 17, instead of the copper, I will bring in gold and instead of the iron, I will bring in silver.

00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:26.560
Instead of the wood, copper, and instead of the stones, iron, and I will appoint peace

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:34.800
as your overseers and righteousness as your task assiners. By mentioning overseers and task assiners,

00:07:35.519 --> 00:07:41.600
Jehovah foretold that gradual improvements would come and the way his people were cared for and

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:49.759
organized. Principles of divine oversight is a powerful tool to ensure that loving oversight

00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:56.399
continues to be provided at Bethel and for theocratic construction projects around the world.

00:07:56.959 --> 00:08:03.680
In a very tangible way, we see evidence of the governing body's determination to train qualified

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:09.040
brothers of the other sheep to provide guidance for Jehovah's people even after the last of the

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:17.279
anointed are taken to heaven. We thank Jehovah for refining his people whom he has chosen to take
