00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.949
When my father's sister and her husband were to help us with this,

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:16.949
Auntie would take us to the meeting.

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.949
I used to spend night and day studying.

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:20.949
I liked what I was always learning

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:26.949
and what really got to me was the hope of everlasting life and paradise

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.949
because I hated death as a child.

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.950
A year after I was baptized I decided to do full-time service

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.950
but my employer didn't want it

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.950
so he did everything to discourage me.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.950
I was determined regardless of what.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.950
I was going to find out.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.950
I went to there, it was an isolated territory.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.950
It was very hot down there.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.950
There was no congregation or anything there.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.950
We didn't have public transportation so we depended on our feet

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.950
to go from door to door.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.950
We cross rivers, take our shoes and go cross the water.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.950
It was a very productive and territory.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.950
If I call, I'd say, three or four doors,

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.950
you get two or three bambas to this out of it.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.950
And if you have ten bambas to this,

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.950
you can say from the ten, sometimes four horses out of them,

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.950
take this time.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.950
And then in a short while,

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.950
we were able to form a group,

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.950
an isolated group,

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.950
which eventually grew to be a congregation.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.950
We were married for fifteen years.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.950
He loved the ministry.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.950
2001, my husband died,

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.950
he died in May.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.950
And then to the August,

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.950
I was diagnosed with cancer.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.950
You can imagine coming out of one situation

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.950
into another situation.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.950
And it was quite devastating

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.950
because it got to a four-stage anesthetic over.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.950
I don't want to die.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.950
The doctors did very well.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.949
The whole was supported me, of course, a hundred percent.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.949
I never thought of stopping food out of service.

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:14.949
We know the whole is not the one responsible.

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:16.949
The whole of it, his love,

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:18.949
has made a arrangement to get us out of it.

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:20.949
So whatever it is that we are going through,

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:23.949
the whole of knows he supports us.

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:26.949
And when we think of an insignificant we are,

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:29.949
you know, on how he reached out to us.

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.949
And his son,

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:35.949
I feel privileged to be used by Jehovah.

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:38.949
When difficult situations come,

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:41.949
I am not worried.

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:44.949
All I keep saying Jehovah, please,

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:47.949
don't let me give up full-time service.

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:50.949
And so I keep on encouraging my younger ones, especially,

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:54.949
keep your face and thought and everything on pandering

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:57.949
and don't worry, just go on.

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:00.949
I see myself as planting and watering,

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:03.949
and Jehovah is making it cool.

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:06.949
And it let me feel very useful to Jehovah.

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:12.949
And I have never gets rid of all the years that have pioneered.

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:16.949
Because I recognize that I have not mistote on anything.

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:18.949
The only thing I have mistote on really

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:21.949
are the troubles that I could have gotten in.
