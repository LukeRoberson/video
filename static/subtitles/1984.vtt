00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:14.730
And in production to the book of Titus, the Apostle Paul's inspired letter to Titus was written about 61 to 64 CE.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:22.899
Paul may have written it in Macedonia sometime after his first imprisonment in Rome.

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:28.899
Evidently after his release, Paul served with Titus in Crete.

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:33.899
After the Apostle left, Titus remained.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.899
Titus had a difficult assignment in Crete.

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.899
As a whole, the people there had a reputation for dishonesty, laziness, and gluttony.

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:50.219
Those bad trades had influenced some in the congregation.

00:00:50.219 --> 00:01:01.219
So in his letter, Paul asked Titus to correct problems in the congregations in Crete and to appoint qualified men to serve as elders.

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.219
The letter to Titus has three chapters.

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:12.219
Chapter 1 sets out the spiritual qualifications for congregation elders.

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:19.219
Paul then tells Titus to approve a severity those who tried to mislead their brothers.

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:27.219
The deceivers include rebellious men, prophetless talkers, and those who insist on adherence to circumcision.

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:38.590
In Chapter 2, Paul sets out many of the fine qualities that should be displayed by Christian men and women, including slaves.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.590
Paul encourages Titus by telling him to speak and act with full authority, adding,

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.590
do not let anyone look down on you.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.030
Did you know?

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:58.030
As shown by Titus' record as a Christian overseer, he could be entrusted with delicate and difficult assignments.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.030
He was courageous, firm, loving, and evidently a good organizer.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.030
Paul was confident that Titus would do a fine job in Crete.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:22.729
In Chapter 3, Paul tells Titus to remind the Christians in Crete to obey the secular authorities, to be reasonable, not quarrelsome, and to display mildness toward all.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:37.280
Finally, Paul instructs Titus to avoid foolish arguments and fights over the law of Moses, and to reject anyone who persists in promoting a sect.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:45.280
As you read the letter to Titus, note how Christian overseers should courageously address problems in the congregation.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:52.280
How God's spirit can draw people from all backgrounds and help them to develop a Christ-like personality,

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:59.280
and how the bad traits that characterize Satan's world should be rejected by all subjects of God's kingdom.
