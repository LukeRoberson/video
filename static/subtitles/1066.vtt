00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:08.169
As humans, we are designed with the ability to imitate what we see and hear.

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:14.169
For example, we learn to talk by imitating the language and accent of our parents.

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:21.170
And as we grew up, we probably also adopted the attitudes and actions of people we associated with.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.170
Clearly, the example of others can have a powerful influence on us.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.170
Today, more than ever, we need to copy good examples of faith.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.170
Why?

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.170
Because we are living in a time when our faith will be tested in many ways.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.170
But not what we will have to do.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.170
I invite you, please, to turn with me to the Book of Jude.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.170
And follow along as we read verse 20 in the Book of Jude.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:05.469
It says, but you beloved ones, build yourselves up on your most holy faith and pray with Holy Spirit.

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:08.469
And I help understand this first.

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:13.469
Think of what a homeowner might do if he knows a really bad storm is approaching.

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:26.469
Likely, he will take steps to build up or strengthen his home, from repairing cracks in the foundation, to reinforcing the doors, walls and windows.

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:40.469
Well, in a similar manner, you and I must take steps to build up or strengthen our faith so that we can protect ourselves against the onslaught of test and trials we are likely to face.

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:51.469
You know, as Jude said, we must continue building ourselves up on our most holy faith, which are the Christian teachings found in God's Word.

00:01:51.469 --> 00:02:01.469
And as we study God's Word and pray for his help, we can gain strength by learning from the examples set by different Bible characters.

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:07.469
There is so much that can be learned from the examples of those in ancient times.

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:19.469
Each talk of this symposium will highlight ways in which we can imitate the faith of Jehovah's loyal servants of the past and reject the course of faithless ones.

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:23.469
Let's start by examining the example of Abel.

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:29.469
He was one of the first humans, the fourth, in fact, to exist on earth.

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:40.469
The Bible describes Abel as a righteous man. He built up a record of living according to Jehovah standards, but his family, however, did not.

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:46.469
We're well familiar with his parents, Adam and Eve. They both rebelled against Jehovah.

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:56.469
And as older brother Cain, well, he was not a positive role model. The Bible described Cain as one whose own works were wicked.

00:02:56.469 --> 00:03:12.469
So you think about that. When you look at Adam, Eve, and Cain, who all displayed a lack of faith in Jehovah, can you imagine what that family dynamic must have been like for Faithful Abel?

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:24.469
The tension, hostility, resentment, lack of spiritual discussions? Do you think Abel's faith was tested? Indeed it was.

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:31.469
And today, our faith may likewise be tested by the actions of those who choose not to serve Jehovah.

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:40.719
We invite you to watch the following reenactment. As you do, note how a sister's faith is tested.

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:50.270
I arrived in a new city during the rainy season. It rained all day, every day, for a whole month.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:56.270
At that time, there were only three publishers there. The first sister I met was my new pioneer partner.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:02.270
At first, I felt as if the people in this territory spoke a different language.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:11.479
When I tried to talk to some people about the Bible, they did not like it, and some were even afraid of these new ideas.

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:19.480
When government officials noticed that we had shared some tracks with the people, they began to watch us and followed us for about three months.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.480
I felt overwhelmed by all of this and became very anxious.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:32.480
I had few return visits or opportunities to speak about Jehovah. I felt lost. I didn't know what to do or where to go.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.480
I often wondered, Father, why did you send me here?

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.480
It was like I had gone from being on a mountain peak to the bottom of a deep valley.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:51.139
As our sister adjusted to her new circumstances, did you know how her trials made her feel?

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:56.139
Anxious, lost, and overwhelmed.

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:01.139
Perhaps you've experienced similar feelings when dealing with tests of your faith.

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:06.139
So how can Abel's example of faith help you and me?

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.139
Let's notice what he did.

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:13.449
Turn with me please to the book of Hebrews.

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:22.100
And we're going to read Hebrews chapter 11, verse 4.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.100
There we read,

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:30.100
By faith, Abel offered God a sacrifice of greater worth than that of Cain.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.100
And through that faith, he received the witness that he was righteous.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.100
For God approved his gifts.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:44.699
And although he died, he still speaks through his faith.

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:51.699
Abel built strong faith in Jehovah even though those around him failed to do so.

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:55.699
Let's consider three steps that he took.

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:01.699
First, Abel took time to ponder spiritual matters.

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:08.699
For instance, he no doubt discerned Jehovah's love and wisdom in creation.

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:15.699
As a shepherd, perhaps he looked at his sheep and recognized that they needed someone to guide and protect them.

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:21.699
And Abel likely discerned as humans, we too need someone to guide and protect us.

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:27.300
Someone far wiser and more powerful than any human.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.300
Second step.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.300
Abel prayed and acted on what he learned.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:39.300
Even though his knowledge was limited, it was enough.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.300
Enough for him to act in faith.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.300
No doubt Abel appealed to Jehovah in prayer to accept his sacrifice.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.300
And Jehovah approved his gift.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.300
Abel demonstrated his faith so powerfully.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:07:00.620
Did you know, in verse 4, it tells us that his example still speaks to us today.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:07.620
At times, we may feel that we don't have enough knowledge or experience to demonstrate faith like Abel.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.620
But that's okay. It doesn't have to be an obstacle.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:16.620
Pray to Jehovah and make the most of the knowledge that you do have.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.620
Act in faith.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.089
And Jehovah will help you.

00:07:22.089 --> 00:07:24.089
The third step.

00:07:24.089 --> 00:07:28.089
Abel remained steadfast when under trial.

00:07:28.089 --> 00:07:32.089
He didn't let the actions of his family affect his faith.

00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:36.089
And we can't let the actions of others affect ours.

00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:44.089
We must never allow something that another person says or does to make us feel ashamed of being one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:46.089
So be ready.

00:07:46.089 --> 00:07:50.089
Be quick to identify yourself as one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:07:50.089 --> 00:07:54.089
It will help to build and fortify your faith.

00:07:54.089 --> 00:07:59.089
And we can also learn from the bad example set by King.

00:07:59.089 --> 00:08:04.089
At Genesis chapter 4, verses 6 and 7, Jehovah warns King about his attitude.

00:08:04.089 --> 00:08:08.089
And he urges him to turn to doing good.

00:08:08.089 --> 00:08:15.089
But just like his faithless parents, King determined he knew what was best for himself.

00:08:15.089 --> 00:08:19.089
And his actions led to the murder of his brother.

00:08:19.089 --> 00:08:26.089
We may go through situations where due to imperfection, we don't always use the best judgment.

00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:31.089
Or it causes us to develop a negative attitude.

00:08:31.089 --> 00:08:37.090
But when the matter is brought to our attention, how will we respond?

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:41.090
You see, let's not imitate the faithless example of Cain.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:45.090
Let's not feel that we always know what's best.

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:51.090
But let's see that warning as a loving tap on the shoulder from our Heavenly Father.

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:56.090
And allow it to readjust our thinking so that we can build our faith

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:58.090
and preserve our relationship with Him.

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:02.399
Well, let's now go back to our sister.

00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:07.399
In the following reenactment, note how she imitates Abel's faith.

00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:15.409
I studied the Bible to see how Jehovah cared for his servants in the past.

00:09:15.409 --> 00:09:19.409
For example, I read how Jehovah told Jacob throughout his life.

00:09:19.409 --> 00:09:22.409
I will be with you wherever you go.

00:09:22.409 --> 00:09:26.409
I pictured Jehovah telling me the same thing.

00:09:26.409 --> 00:09:28.409
Don't worry, just go.

00:09:28.409 --> 00:09:31.409
And I will always be there to help you.

00:09:31.409 --> 00:09:35.409
I begged him to help me to be balanced, to feel peace,

00:09:35.409 --> 00:09:38.409
and to have courage to go out in the ministry.

00:09:38.409 --> 00:09:42.409
One day, Jehovah helped me to find a very good Bible student.

00:09:42.409 --> 00:09:47.409
It was an absolutely wonderful and unexpected gift from Jehovah.

00:09:47.409 --> 00:09:51.409
Our small group joins congregation meetings through the Internet.

00:09:51.409 --> 00:09:55.409
This arrangement is a valuable source of spiritual food for me.

00:09:55.409 --> 00:09:59.409
We get together for meals and association as well.

00:09:59.409 --> 00:10:04.409
The experiences on JW Broadcasting make me feel that I am not alone.

00:10:04.409 --> 00:10:07.409
And I always smile and wake by at the end.

00:10:07.409 --> 00:10:09.409
It's wonderful to be here.

00:10:09.409 --> 00:10:16.799
Did you notice how our sister built up her faith in Jehovah?

00:10:16.799 --> 00:10:20.799
She imitated Abel's example and she followed those steps.

00:10:20.799 --> 00:10:24.799
The first step, she pondered on spiritual matters.

00:10:24.799 --> 00:10:28.799
She studied the Bible to see how Jehovah cared for his servants in the past.

00:10:28.799 --> 00:10:32.799
And then she applied what she learned to her situation.

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:38.799
Then the second step, she prayed and acted on what she learned.

00:10:38.799 --> 00:10:44.799
Her prayer was that Jehovah helped her to be balanced, to feel peace,

00:10:44.799 --> 00:10:47.799
and to have courage to go into the ministry.

00:10:47.799 --> 00:10:50.799
And then she acted in faith.

00:10:50.799 --> 00:10:55.799
And despite the challenges in the ministry, she took the third step.

00:10:55.799 --> 00:10:59.799
She remained steadfast under trial.

00:10:59.799 --> 00:11:02.799
She persevered and was blessed with a study.

00:11:02.799 --> 00:11:06.799
And then she reinforced her faith by joining in congregation meetings

00:11:06.799 --> 00:11:10.799
and benefiting from the wholesome association of the Brotherhood.

00:11:10.799 --> 00:11:13.799
And what was the result?

00:11:13.799 --> 00:11:16.799
Jehovah blessed her efforts.

00:11:16.799 --> 00:11:21.799
And if you and I follow these steps, he will bless our efforts as well.

00:11:21.799 --> 00:11:27.799
By utilizing this tremendous gift, Jehovah has given us the power of example.

00:11:27.799 --> 00:11:30.799
You and I can imitate Abel.

00:11:30.799 --> 00:11:33.799
And as we build and fortify our faith,

00:11:33.799 --> 00:11:40.299
we will weather any storm of adversity that comes our way.

00:11:40.299 --> 00:11:43.299
For the Gary Bro, a helper to the service committee,

00:11:43.299 --> 00:11:46.299
will now present the next talk of this symposium,

00:11:46.299 --> 00:11:52.299
imitate the faithful, not the faithless, enoch, not lamek.
