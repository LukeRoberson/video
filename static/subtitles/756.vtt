00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:04.139
How would you students answer this question?

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:07.820
Do you feel closer to Jehovah now

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.699
than you did before your Gilead training began?

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.059
The answer is a resounding yes, isn't it?

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:22.859
Maybe you can relate to these comments of graduates of past classes of Gilead.

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:25.100
One brother said,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.899
Absolutely yes.

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:32.780
I believe I now experience more fully what it means to walk with God

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:36.500
and know and rely upon him as a close friend,

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.979
not merely someone I turn and look up to in prayer.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.979
As Sister said, Gilead definitely drew me closer to Jehovah.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.340
The way we study the scriptures with intensity

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.500
truly made me feel like the Bible was a letter Jehovah wrote to me.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.700
Another brother said,

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:03.619
Jehovah communicated with such clarity which made it real and personal.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:08.620
It made me feel closer to Jehovah than ever before

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.579
and that feeling will never be forgotten.

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:19.579
Well, unquestionably, your deep study of God's Word during Gilead drew you closer to Jehovah.

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:21.939
But here's the question.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.140
How close can you be?

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:29.060
How close can your relationship with Jehovah get?

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.299
You saw it leap forward in five months of deep Bible study.

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.340
But is there a limit? Is there more will you ever get done?

00:01:38.019 --> 00:01:40.459
Consider two points that answer that question.

00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:44.180
The first one is found in the book of James, chapter four.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.620
And let's read together the first part of verse eight.

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:53.500
And let's read it with that question in mind.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.140
Is there any limit to how close our relationship with Jehovah could be?

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.780
James four, eight says,

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:08.139
draw close to God and he will draw close to you.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.219
So is there any limit indicated here?

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:18.539
Well, it is true that in English, this phrase to draw close to someone could be applied

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:21.979
in a physical sense, actually standing next to someone.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.419
And in that case, there is a limit.

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:25.659
You can only stand so close to someone.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.340
But that's not really the sense of James four, eight, isn't it?

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:31.659
Rather, it's in this sense.

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:33.979
When we talk about our close friends,

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:37.979
we're not talking about those that are nearest in proximity.

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:42.860
We're talking about the depth of our relationship, the closeness of our friendship.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.139
And so then to draw close to God then means to strengthen our relationship,

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:50.300
strengthen our friendship with him.

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:55.500
And then looking at the verse, does it appear that there's any limit to how close that

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.539
relationship can get?

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.259
The implication is, as long as we keep drawing close to Jehovah,

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:04.139
then he'll keep drawing close to us.

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:07.979
And that takes us to our second point.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.900
And that is the real life example of God's Son.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.500
Because Jesus drew close to Jehovah clearly.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.419
He was taught by Jehovah.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.539
Remember Isaiah 54 regarding Jesus' pre-human existence, where he said,

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.099
he awakens me morning by morning.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.419
He awakens my ear to listen like the taught ones.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.620
Does that sound a bit like your Gilead training?

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.780
Morning by morning.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.379
Jehovah was awakening your ear.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.419
Yet Jesus wasn't instructed by Jehovah for five months.

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:45.020
He was instructed for billions of years.

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:52.860
And during all that time, his relationship with his father continued to grow and deepen.

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:56.460
So then we put it all together.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.020
You saw your relationship with Jehovah grow significantly in five months of deep Bible study.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.740
James 4.8 encourages us to just keep drawing close to Jehovah.

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:13.900
And Jesus did so for billions of years and look at how close his relationship with Jehovah is.

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:16.300
So then what's the answer?

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.300
How close can you be to Jehovah?

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.660
The potential for your relationship with Jehovah to deepen is endless.

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:32.740
Well, that's just wonderful to contemplate, isn't it?

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.740
But let's make some application because this really becomes a very important overall lesson

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.779
that you take with you from your Gilead experience.

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:46.740
That is how your deep Bible study affected your relationship with Jehovah.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.819
And one of the reasons why this is such an important lesson is because your success in your

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:58.579
assignment is directly connected to the depth of your relationship with Jehovah.

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:05.939
Your success in your assignment is directly connected to the depth of your relationship with

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:07.939
Jehovah. Now, why can we say that?

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:15.699
It's because of what takes place when we draw close to Jehovah through a study of his word.

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:17.620
In turn, with me, please, to the book of Psalms.

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:30.120
And we'll read the 25th Psalm in verse four, Psalm 254.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:39.319
It says, make me know your ways, O Jehovah. Teach me your paths.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.560
This is what's happening when we study God's word, isn't it? We are coming to know Jehovah God's ways.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:52.199
The watchtower once said it this way. It said, as we get a deeper and deeper understanding of God's

00:05:52.199 --> 00:06:02.120
word, we become imbued with God's way of thinking. We become imbued with God's way of thinking.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:10.839
The dictionary said that the word imbu implies the introduction of a quality that fills and permeates

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:15.879
the whole being. So like dying a garment or leavening bread.

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:22.680
But here, we're talking about being imbued with God's thinking that maybe God's thinking would fill

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.160
and permeate our whole being. Is that possible?

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:35.160
Think back to the example of Jesus. As we discuss, Jesus drew close to Jehovah. He was taught by

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:42.759
Jehovah for billions of years and what was happening during that whole time. He was being imbued

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:49.800
with Jehovah God's thinking. And it so permeated him that when he was on earth, he could say it, John

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:58.439
149, whoever has seen me has seen the Father also. So in other words, everything that Jesus said,

00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:05.319
everything that he did while on earth in every situation, well, we could imagine Jehovah doing

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:14.920
and saying those very things. And that is why the success of your assignment is directly connected

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:21.959
to the depth of your relationship with Jehovah. The more you draw close to Jehovah through a study of

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:29.319
his word, the more you are imbued with his thinking and the more than you will do and act and say

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:38.439
things as Jehovah would. And so how does this play out? Well, in your assignment, if you have the

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:45.079
privilege to contribute to significant decisions that will affect others in your department or at the

00:07:45.079 --> 00:07:51.720
branch or in the field, even. Well, you want to be guided by a Jehovah's thinking, don't you?

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:57.720
You want to do things as he would do them. Well, the closer you are to Jehovah, the deeper that

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:07.129
relationship is, the more your decisions will mirror his. But of course, we know strengthening

00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:12.009
and stabilizing others isn't always done in big grand gestures like that. Big decisions, new

00:08:12.009 --> 00:08:18.649
organizational arrangements, quite often is the day-to-day interactions with others that really

00:08:18.649 --> 00:08:24.649
encourages them. And isn't it true? We learn so much from those intimate conversations that Jesus

00:08:24.649 --> 00:08:31.290
had with others, or seemingly incidental interactions that he had with others that the Bible

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:40.009
records. Well, you will strengthen others in similar ways. For example, when you are guided by

00:08:40.009 --> 00:08:45.690
Jehovah's thinking in personal matters, such as in your choice of dress and grooming.

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:52.169
Well, others will certainly notice that, and that will strengthen their resolve to make good decisions

00:08:52.169 --> 00:08:58.649
in these personal areas. When you are guided by Jehovah's thinking in the use of your time,

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:04.490
as busy as you will be when the friends see you in the ministry at the meetings working hard

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:10.090
in your assignment, they will take notice of that, and that will strengthen their resolve to make

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:16.409
good priorities in their life. Every time you steer a negative conversation to the positive,

00:09:16.409 --> 00:09:22.649
every time you show a willingness to do humble tasks, every time you take the time to get the other

00:09:22.649 --> 00:09:29.049
side of the story before rendering judgment. It's in all these areas of your daily life, you give

00:09:29.049 --> 00:09:34.570
evidence that you have drawn close to Jehovah, you have been imbued with his thinking,

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:43.289
and you are acting as Jehovah would. And in that case, you absolutely will strengthen and stabilize

00:09:43.289 --> 00:09:54.259
your brothers. Well, we love you for your relationship with Jehovah, and we encourage you to take

00:09:54.259 --> 00:10:00.820
this lesson of Gilead with you, the effect that your deep Bible study had on your relationship with

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:08.340
Jehovah, and keep drawing close to him. The potential is endless, and this is what will ensure your

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:16.899
success. Well, may the rich blessing of Jehovah, your friend, be with you as you use your Gilead

00:10:16.899 --> 00:10:19.379
training in the assignments he has given you.
