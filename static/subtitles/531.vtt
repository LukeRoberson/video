00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:09.900
Now, longer you live, the more you realize acquiring wisdom is a lifelong process, really

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.900
a daily one.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.859
Let's just analyze the process of acquiring wisdom.

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.660
The basis for wisdom is knowledge.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:27.780
So the first step is to acquire knowledge, but wisdom isn't just knowing a lot of things.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.859
Our insight book under the subject knowledge says this.

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:39.299
Wisdom is the ability to put knowledge to work or to use it, the intelligent application

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:40.700
of learning.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.219
A person might have considerable knowledge, but not know how to use it.

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.619
Because of lacking wisdom, Jesus linked wisdom with accomplishment and saying wisdom

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:58.299
is proved righteous by its works.

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:05.420
To illustrate, someone once said, knowledge without wisdom is like having flower, eggs,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:13.739
butter, milk, and sugar, but not knowing how to put it all together to make a cake.

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:20.299
So we might say that in God's Word, we have all the ingredients.

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.500
All the principles are there for wisdom.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.180
We have to know how to put those principles together.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.219
Make the cake.

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:31.620
The recipe is there.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:38.819
Now sometimes in recipes, most of the time really, they list all the ingredients and sometimes

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:43.620
even step by step procedures to make a cake.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:52.099
You might think, well, I wish I could see an expert cook, baker, actually put those ingredients

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:53.099
together.

00:01:53.099 --> 00:02:01.140
Well, interesting today on the internet, you have these videos with experts doing just that.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.420
Well in a way, that is what Chahova has done for us.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.740
Because in the Bible, we have not just principles.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:19.539
We have accounts of people putting those principles to work in their life.

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:23.419
They're showing us how to make the cake as it were.

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:29.419
Now here's, let's take an example of a married couple who might use accounts from the

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:35.500
Bible to help them see principles being put to work.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.659
Those that will help them resolve a problem that will preserve their peace and unity.

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:46.139
And I must add this disclaimer.

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:53.060
If the person is described in this scenario, resemble anyone you know, it is a plainly

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.219
coincidental, as they say.

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:02.219
Now here's why she wants to raise an issue with her husband.

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:03.219
What's the problem?

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:05.539
She feels stressed out.

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:08.819
Both of them work every day at their Theocratic assignments.

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:14.740
The husband is very hospitable and he likes to invite people over for a meal.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.580
Well, that's nice.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.979
She likes that too.

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:24.819
The problem is, she ends up doing all the work, making the menu, preparing the meal, cleaning

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.340
up afterward, she's stressed.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.099
Now she knows the principle.

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:38.340
Cleasy, S.E.37, there's a time to keep quiet and a time to speak.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:48.379
Now can she find an example in the Bible of a wife who put that principle to work?

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:50.659
Ah, she thinks of Esther.

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:56.539
Remember Esther, Queen Esther, Esther, chapter 5.

00:03:56.539 --> 00:04:01.819
She had a very delicate problem to discuss whether her husband the king, and she likely

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.659
knew this principle a time to speak.

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:08.900
How did she put that to work?

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:15.020
Well, she created a suitable setting to reveal what was in her heart.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.740
She invited him to especially prepared banquets with things she knew he would like, including

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.220
wine.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.500
And when he was in a good mood, she presented the problem at the right moment, and she

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.300
had success.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.220
So having that example in mind, the wife will choose a time, create a setting when her

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:45.420
husband is relaxed, and she can speak respectfully about the situation.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:51.339
Now what about the Christian husband in this scenario?

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:59.259
Now he knows the principle in 1 Peter 3.7, you husband, in the same way, continued dwelling

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:06.500
with them according to knowledge, assigned them honor as to a weaker vessel, the feminine

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.500
one.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.060
So he knows the principle.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.459
Know your wife's limitations, treat her considerably.

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:23.980
Now can he find a Bible example of a wise husband who put that principle to work in a practical

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:24.980
way?

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.100
Now let's take a brief glance at Genesis chapter 18.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:36.339
We're not going to read all these verses, but in verses 1 to 8, here's the scenario.

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:43.100
Three important visitors show up unexpectedly at the 10th of Abraham.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.459
He invites them for a meal.

00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:48.300
He says, just a piece of bread.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.620
Well, did he leave it to Sarah to figure out the menu?

00:05:53.459 --> 00:06:01.500
He arranges for an elaborate meal consisting of freshly baked bread, butter, milk, choice,

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.500
tender meat.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.860
Did he leave it to Sarah to do all the work?

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.300
Well he did ask her to prepare the bread.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:18.819
But Abraham was personally involved in all the preparations, even setting the table with

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:22.740
the food and acting as a waiter.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:28.300
So after reviewing that account, the husband sees the wisdom of helping his wife with the

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:34.819
work involved in hosting guests and including cleaning up afterwards.

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:42.779
Now this husband, who knows his wife, is overly stressed, might think of the principle

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:47.139
to any Ephesians 5, 25.

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:54.379
Husbands continue loving your wives just as the Christ also loved the congregation.

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:57.899
Well, how did Christ love the congregation?

00:06:57.899 --> 00:07:02.899
How did he put that principle of love to work with the disciples?

00:07:02.899 --> 00:07:04.420
Here's one example.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:14.819
If you look in Matthew 1521, we read there, leaving there, that is probably a cavernium,

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:18.139
Jesus now went into the region of Tyre and Sidon.

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:25.660
So let me think to yourself, why is the Lord going outside the boundaries or the borders

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.180
of Israel into Gentile territory?

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.180
He was assigned to Israel.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.779
The cross-reference you'll see is Mark 724.

00:07:38.779 --> 00:07:46.459
And it adds this, he rose up from there and went into the region of Tyre and Sidon.

00:07:46.459 --> 00:07:54.079
There he entered into a house and did not want anyone to know it, but he could not escape

00:07:54.079 --> 00:07:55.079
notice.

00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:58.939
Now this seems a little mysterious, perhaps at first.

00:07:58.939 --> 00:08:05.620
Why does the Lord not want anyone to know where he was with the apostles?

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:14.860
The watchtower has commented that comparing this account with Mark 630 and 31, we see

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:21.500
that not very long before, Jesus had told the apostles that they should find an isolated

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.180
place and rest up a little.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:33.899
Well, it never worked out because wherever Jesus went, the crowds followed him.

00:08:33.899 --> 00:08:41.139
So by going into Phoenicia, outside the borders of Israel, not letting anyone else know

00:08:41.139 --> 00:08:51.700
where he was going, taking the apostles with him, they could get some much-needed rest.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:09:00.220
So we see how Jesus put the principle of love to work in the way He treated his disciples,

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.419
wise husbands, who do the same.

00:09:03.419 --> 00:09:09.460
And there are times, really, during our busy lives when we too, and especially our dear

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:18.980
wives, need to rest up a little, even during this pandemic where we, on travel, is limited.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:26.419
Well, let's try to find a way, sometime away from our normal routine, so the two of you

00:09:26.419 --> 00:09:29.899
can rest up a little.

00:09:29.899 --> 00:09:36.779
So in summary, as we go through our lives, let's just go on acquiring wisdom and as we acquire

00:09:36.779 --> 00:09:43.659
knowledge of God's Word, see how others put that knowledge to work, we can act wisely.
