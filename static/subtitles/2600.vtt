00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:16.179
More than 3,400 were in attendance at the Kalbiuk City District Convention of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:21.179
This was a special event for the 41 who were baptized.

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:37.810
But also for many others, they were survivors of Super Typhoon Haiyan, which had struck just one month earlier.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.810
More than 185,000 Jehovah's Witnesses live in the Philippines.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:01:00.740
When Super Typhoon Haiyan made landfall on November 8, 2013, many of these witnesses were in the direct path of the storm.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.740
Disaster relief desk.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:11.760
Before the storm hit, the Philippines' branch office began coordinating the evacuation and relief efforts.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.760
We are preparing for the typhoon because the news are said that we need to prepare.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:23.760
So I take everybody, every elder, in congregation, a text that they need to evacuate to the separate place.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.760
We knew it was going to do tremendous damage.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.760
Taplaban City on the island of Laita was one of the areas hit the hardest.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.760
The congregations in Taplaban suffered greatly.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.760
Then Papa told us, wake up, wake up! The rain is about to get stronger.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.760
Suddenly, a strongest wind blew and the roof finally blew off.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.760
We tried to hold on, but we were being lifted from the ground, so we let go.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.010
Otherwise, we would have been blown away.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.010
We removed everything that was inside that refrigerator.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:05.269
And then we put the literature inside and our papa arranged it.

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:14.159
As the storm approached, many families evacuated their homes to more solid structures.

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:18.159
60 persons sought shelter at the Kingdom Hall.

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:25.500
A five-meter high storm surge crashed into the building, collapsing the walls.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.500
Many were swept away.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.500
22 people died.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:38.379
Cheryl, just 13 years old, was one of those swept away by the surge.

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.379
She survived by climbing a tree.

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:49.379
The brothers tell me that in these last days, we cannot avoid calamities like this.

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.379
Only Cheryl and her brothers survived.

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:00.379
I lost my home. I lost my family members.

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.379
And temporarily, I lost my trust in God.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:16.110
The elders told me it was okay to cry because it would get what was in my heart out into the open.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.110
The brothers' red scriptures that reminded me of the resurrection.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:30.110
Happily, she was reunited with her brother just one day before the district convention in Kaupaya.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:37.110
About 15 kilometers south of the Klauban city, 44 members of the Tanawan congregation,

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:51.889
sought refuge in their Kingdom Hall.

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:53.889
You see, we're a big family here.

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:57.889
My mother, my children, my grandchildren.

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:00.889
We stayed here until the Typhoon arrived.

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:06.889
The winds intensified and the sea water started to flood our Kingdom Hall.

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:09.889
I was there joining them in prayer.

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:10.889
I was there.

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.889
The water started rushing in.

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:23.060
Because of the impact of the wind and the water and the waves, the windows were destroyed.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.949
That side over there was open.

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:31.949
The debris came in and I was swept outside.

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:39.189
When I was being swept away, a big piece of wood floated by the wind.

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:43.189
The wind came in and I was swept outside.

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:48.189
When I was being swept away, a big piece of wood floated by and I grabbed onto it.

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:51.189
Because I don't know how to swim.

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:57.189
I was swept past that house and farther away.

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:00.189
There was debris all over me.

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:07.189
I asked, oh, is it in my group? Have you seen my mother?

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:12.189
The waves came crashing, the wind blew.

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:16.189
That was the time when the Kingdom Hall started to flood.

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:25.189
I was strengthened from contemplating the meaning of the year-tax.

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:31.189
It says, Jehovah, your God is with you.

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:36.189
Amazingly, their Kingdom Hall was lifted from its foundation and moved 15 meters.

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:40.189
All 44 survived.

00:05:40.189 --> 00:06:11.100
About 80 kilometers to the east, on Summer Island,

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:18.100
the Gian congregation would have to endure winds of 275 kilometers per hour.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:23.100
Almost 101% of the brothers' homes are destroyed.

00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:35.459
Many lost their entire means of living because of the extensive damage to the coconut groves in the fishing industry.

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:40.459
When the typhoon struck, we are inside the Kingdom Hall.

00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:45.459
After the meeting, some of the brothers stayed in the Kingdom Hall and

00:06:45.459 --> 00:06:51.459
other half of the group went to the sister's house, especially the children's.

00:06:51.459 --> 00:06:56.459
Everything, the ceiling fell down and the roof is gone.

00:06:56.459 --> 00:07:03.459
So when we saw that our lives are in danger,

00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:06.459
we protected one another.

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:21.180
And we heard, it sounds like the hundreds of horses are running on the ceiling.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:25.180
Another brother said, put your monoblux chair on your head.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.180
So we put the monoblux chair.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:34.180
Everybody of us are using the monoblux chair to protect our head.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.180
So that's the roofing material heating his monoblux chair.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.180
That was so dangerous.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:46.199
We're all trembling because of the cold.

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:48.199
We are all wet.

00:07:48.199 --> 00:07:53.199
Even the baby is crying here.

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:57.199
All 47 congregation members survived.

00:07:57.199 --> 00:08:02.540
So many more stories could be told.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.540
Like Eddon, who survived along with others,

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:09.540
huddled under the last standing wall of the Kingdom Hall.

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:15.540
Or eight-year-old Kurt, who despite his injury, freed himself from a collapse wall

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.540
and braved the raging waters to be reunited with his father.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:24.540
Or Michael, the self-sacrificing elder, who pushed up a collapse roof

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:29.540
to allow those trapped underneath to breathe.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:37.539
Typhoon Haiyan was one of the strongest storms ever to make landfall anywhere in the world.

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:42.539
More than 6,200 lost their lives in the storm.

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:48.539
33 were Jehovah's Witnesses, with tens still missing and presumed dead.

00:08:48.539 --> 00:08:56.580
To build up those who suffered losses, the governing bodies sent one of its members.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:01.580
Traveling with him were representatives from the Philippine's Grand Chalfish.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:09.149
There are times when you really feel very overwhelmed by the problems that you're facing right now.

00:09:09.149 --> 00:09:14.149
I'm sure that you have a lot of problems.

00:09:14.149 --> 00:09:20.149
Well, Jehovah will help you so that you can carry whatever it is that you experience.

00:09:20.149 --> 00:09:25.149
When the Typhoon Haiyan struck on Friday, immediately on Saturday,

00:09:25.149 --> 00:09:34.149
several brothers were able to mobilize food staff and support the need of the brothers locally.

00:09:34.149 --> 00:09:44.149
We made arrangements that four trucks from the branch could be leaving a few days after the storm had passed through.

00:09:44.149 --> 00:09:49.980
The disaster in the Philippines was just so enormous.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:55.980
The Typhoon took not only their homes, but basically all the material things that they had.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:04.279
Really, it's at these crisis times when we see the brotherhood at its best.

00:10:04.279 --> 00:10:13.279
We bring relief goods to the brothers, rice, noodles, coffee, and other needs of the brothers.

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:23.730
The organization immediately decided to use Kingdom Halls as temporary shelters,

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:30.730
with others living at the homes of fellow witnesses in Santa Margarita and Calbrio, which were not destroyed.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:37.730
I saw all the steps being taken to bring relief from all those who don't leave it,

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:45.730
who are also witnesses, food, clothing, and many things to fill our spiritual needs.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:50.730
Well, we are very much appreciative of Jehovah's way of doing things.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:57.730
We know that he is directing everything and that this relief work is with his backup.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:09.210
When we came on this trip, it was our desire to try to encourage and really strengthen the brothers.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:16.210
But I think actually, through our association with them, we were the ones who were rebuilt and encouraged

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:22.210
because of their great faith and also because of the good spirit they have to continue.
