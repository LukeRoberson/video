00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:08.310
Moving to serve for the need for kingdom preachers is greater can be intimidating.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:13.830
Before moving, we cannot know all the details of what our life will be like.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.350
However, the Bible can give us the wisdom to successfully meet any challenges we face

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.269
after moving.

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:24.789
We must put faith in it.

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.789
Faith can motivate us to seize opportunities to serve Jehovah.

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.429
Please locate Hebrews 11 to 8 through 10.

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:40.909
Abrams willing us to leave what was comfortable and familiar and move to a new land when he

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:47.710
was in his 70s was a powerful demonstration of faith.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.590
Let's read Hebrews 11 to 8 through 10.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.990
By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place he was to receive

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.710
as an inheritance.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.909
He went out, although not knowing where he was going.

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:11.430
By faith he lived as a foreigner in the land of the promise as in a foreign land, living

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.510
intense with Isaac and Jacob, the heir with him of the very same promise.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:26.180
For he was awaiting the city having real foundations whose designer and builder is God.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.620
He didn't even know where he was being assigned.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:37.060
But he went, based on his faith, he knew that the real life was not back home.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.340
It was not in his new assignment.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.219
He looked for the fulfillment of future promises.

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:48.859
Did Abraham and Sarah face any difficulties along the way?

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:51.620
Yes, they did.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:58.099
Unexpected circumstances were thrust upon them, but did Jehovah see them through?

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:02.620
And Genesis 20 verses 3 through 7.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.060
To protect his life Abraham called Sarah his sister.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.620
So the king of year or felt he could take her as his wife.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.340
This was a difficult time for Abraham and Sarah.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.099
Did Jehovah work things out?

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.219
Let's read Genesis 20 verses 3 through 7.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.379
God came by night to Abimalak in a dream and said to him,

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:38.099
here you are as good as dead because of the woman whom you have taken since she is married

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.340
and belongs to another man.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.419
However, Abimalak had not gone near her.

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:50.699
So he said, Jehovah, will you kill a nation that is really innocent?

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:54.060
Did he not say to me, she is my sister?

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.259
And did she not say he is my brother?

00:02:58.259 --> 00:03:04.620
I did this with an honest heart and innocent hands.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.780
Then the true God said to him in the dream,

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.259
I know that you did this with an honest heart.

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:15.020
So I held you back from sinning against me.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.699
That is why I did not allow you to touch her.

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:23.020
Now return the man's wife for he is a prophet.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.300
And he will make supplication for you and you will keep living.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.300
But if you are not returning her,

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:39.090
know that you will surely die, you and all who are yours.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:46.050
Jehovah will be with us too if we act in faith to expand our ministry.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:53.729
We will get through the surprises and enjoy the rewards of reaching out in this way.

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:58.370
Although we cannot know all the challenges that we may encounter,

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:06.409
we can take practical steps to choose a location and prepare to make adjustments.

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:11.650
Do you remember Jesus' words at Luke chapter 14, verse 28?

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.530
He indicated that a person who wanted to build a tower

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.009
would first calculate the expense to see if he had enough to complete it.

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:23.449
That was practical.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:30.769
And we can do the same when contemplating, relocating to where the need is greater.

00:04:30.769 --> 00:04:33.529
We can get a taste of the blessings we will experience

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:38.129
by participating in preaching campaigns organized by the branch office

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:42.889
are working seldom work territory.

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.930
Might you have the circumstances to move or the need is greater?

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.009
If you're interested in serving in another land,

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.970
do careful research and speak to your congregation elders.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:00.850
They can forward your letter to the branch office of the country that interests you.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.689
If you're unable to move to another land, what is another option?

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:09.529
You can, through your elders,

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:17.089
write to the local branch office for information about congregations that have a need.

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:21.569
Your circuit overseer can provide information about nearby congregations

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:23.850
that may need help.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.050
In the following video, note how one brother

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:33.170
overcame his fear of serving where the need is greater.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:38.250
If you told me two years ago that I'd be moving where the need was greater,

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:44.800
I would have laughed.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.879
It all started when they announced a special preaching campaign.

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:51.879
My friend Samuel encouraged me to apply with him.

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:54.759
So, what do you think?

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:56.680
Yeah.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.879
No, but you enjoy that.

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:00.839
I know you're going to love it.

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:02.959
That's why I got you a form as well, right?

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:04.439
We can do this.

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:08.639
OK.

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:12.560
I knew I could do more, but I was comfortable.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.399
I like doing things on my own terms.

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:19.279
But really, I was afraid of the unknown.

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:25.259
I needed to examine my heart.

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:29.620
When I read about Abraham's faith at Hebrews 11, 8,

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.500
it's like the words jumped off the page.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:39.579
He went out, although not knowing why he was going.

00:06:39.579 --> 00:06:45.660
Who better to be in control of my life than Jehovah?

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.379
A door was open to me.

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:49.540
I just needed to go through it.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.139
And what I experienced changed my life.

00:06:53.139 --> 00:07:03.560
The results of the campaign were incredible.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.759
And the experience pushed me out of my comfort zone.

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:15.149
Amen.

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:17.149
I'm going to trust you.

00:07:17.149 --> 00:07:18.550
Thank you.

00:07:34.019 --> 00:07:46.009
I saw the ministry in a new way, and I wanted to do more.

00:07:46.009 --> 00:07:51.480
So, I calculated the cost and worked with my local elders

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.480
to write to the branch office.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:08:09.649
When I heard back with some suggestions,

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:14.850
I prayed about it and did research before choosing.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:19.250
There were many unknowns, but I couldn't wait.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:24.279
It was hard to say goodbye to my friends,

00:08:24.279 --> 00:08:40.019
but I was ready for whatever Jehovah had installed me.

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:46.059
Did you notice how faith was shown and what blessings resulted?

00:08:46.059 --> 00:08:50.659
The young brother admitted he was in a comfort zone.

00:08:50.659 --> 00:08:55.860
Another brother invited him to join in a special preaching campaign.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.460
Our brother was hesitant to reach out.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.659
However, he read about Abraham.

00:09:02.659 --> 00:09:04.259
What did he conclude?

00:09:04.259 --> 00:09:09.659
He said, who better to control my life than Jehovah?

00:09:09.659 --> 00:09:16.120
He thoroughly enjoyed the experience of the special campaign.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.120
It fired him up.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:23.320
And the next thing we know, he is relocating to another congregation

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.919
that needed help.

00:09:25.919 --> 00:09:32.320
Although you will need to make sacrifices and you may face unexpected challenges,

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:39.320
you will gain many blessings, drawing you ever closer to Jehovah.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:45.919
There's no need to worry about the good things you may be denied temporarily.

00:09:45.919 --> 00:09:54.519
Jehovah knows what you presently need and will supply it to you on time.

00:09:54.519 --> 00:10:00.120
Luke 12-31 advises, keep seeking God's kingdom,

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:04.919
and all the things you need will be added to you.

00:10:04.919 --> 00:10:07.919
As a single person or as a family,

00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:15.509
consider if you can move to where the need is greater.

00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:19.309
Brother Mark Numer, a helper to the teaching committee,

00:10:19.309 --> 00:10:23.509
will now consider the next talk of this symposium.

00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:32.509
Enter the door to activity and faith, a plan for the school for kingdom evangelizers.
