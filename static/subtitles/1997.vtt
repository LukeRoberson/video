00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:12.500
And in production to the book of John, when he was a much younger man, John and his

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.339
brother James were mending their fishing nets alongside the Sea of Galilee when Jesus

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:22.780
invited them to be his followers.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:29.539
After the Passover of 31 CE, Jesus chose John as one of his twelve apostles.

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.899
John was among Jesus' closest companions, and the disciple to whom he entrusted the

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:38.700
care of his mother, Mary.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.659
The Gospel of John is the last of the four gospels.

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:51.820
It was written about 98 CE in or around Ephesus, nearly 65 years after Jesus' death.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:01:00.679
During those decades, Jesus' prophecy concerning the destruction of Jerusalem was fulfilled.

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:08.280
It is said that 92 percent of this book contains material not covered in the other gospels.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.959
John writes about love more than any other gospel writer.

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:18.519
The Book of John contains 21 chapters.

00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:24.239
Chapter 1 reveals Jesus' role in the heavens before coming to earth.

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:30.359
He is described as the one through whom Jehovah created all other things.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:37.459
Jesus is called the Word, highlighting his assignment as Jehovah's Spokesman.

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:42.900
Chapters 2 to 6 cover about two years of Jesus' ministry.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.180
Chapter 2 describes Jesus' first miracle at a wedding feast in Cana.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:57.819
When the wine ran out, he miraculously turned some 380 liters or 100 gallons of water into fine wine.

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:03.019
Seeing this miracle strengthen the faith of Jesus' disciples.

00:02:03.019 --> 00:02:11.860
Chapter 6 reports how Jesus miraculously fed a crowd of about 5,000 men along with women and children.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.460
Chapter 7 to 12 cover the events following the Passover of 32 CE.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.300
Jesus travels to Bethany and resurrects his friend Lazarus.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:30.740
Although Lazarus had been dead for four days, he comes back to life at Jesus' command.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.580
Chapter 12 contains a description of Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.060
A large crowd greets him with the words,

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:41.060
Save we pray you.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.479
Blessed is the one who comes in Jehovah's name, the King of Israel.

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:57.000
Chapters 13 to 19 relate the events of just one day, nice and 14, 33 CE.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:06.340
Jesus celebrates the Passover with his apostles in an upper room in Jerusalem.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.180
Did you know?

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:13.620
We can find evidence in the book of John that supports the fact that Jesus celebrated four

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.539
Passover's during his ministry. This provides one of the lines of evidence that his ministry

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:27.659
was three and a half years long. Showing great humility at the final Passover,

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:32.300
Jesus performs the duty of a servant, washing the feet of his apostles.

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:35.979
Later that evening, Jesus says,

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:42.300
I am giving you a new commandment that you love one another, just as I have loved you.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.860
The commandment was new because it required that Christ's disciples show love to a greater degree.

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:55.180
Chapter 17 contains Jesus' last prayer in the presence of his disciples.

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:03.020
Later in the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus fearlessly identifies himself to the soldiers who

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:09.340
come to arrest him. Shortly thereafter, Jesus suffers death for all mankind.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.980
Chapters 20 and 21 relate how the resurrected Jesus appears to his disciples on various occasions.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:28.980
As you read the Gospel of John, note Jesus' love for mankind, his example of humility,

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:36.579
and his identity as the Messiah, the King of God's Kingdom.
