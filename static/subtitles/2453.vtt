00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.710
It is evident that JW Broadcasting has Jehovah's Blessing.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:21.289
Those involved in preparing the studio, the equipment, and the content all said that they

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:28.129
could feel Jehovah's Hand directing every step, every decision, every day.

00:00:28.129 --> 00:00:33.929
Upon learning of its intended purpose, many long days went into planning its design and

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:38.649
what it would take to construct it and have it ready as soon as possible.

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.770
Research that usually takes months was completed in days.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.689
The purchasing department ordered hundreds of items in record time, starting of course

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:52.649
with the items that required the most lead time.

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.689
In the meantime, a scout team got busy searching for a suitable location and a good one was

00:00:58.689 --> 00:01:03.409
found in the office complex at 30 Columbia Heights.

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.849
Starting Jehovah's direction on this endeavor, the brothers vacated the entire area in just

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:14.120
one week.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:23.329
The maintenance departments then prepared the room for television production while the

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:27.890
design team diligently worked on the look of the set.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.290
Color and lighting were key pieces in conveying a dignified, yet modern feel.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:43.390
The approved design was then translated into an actual set by the construction team.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:59.379
Many brothers and sisters from around the U.S. were called into assist.

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:11.300
After only a few days, the equipment started to arrive.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:20.469
Miles of cables were installed, and the technical team had to ensure that all of the pieces

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:28.840
of hardware and software worked well together.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.919
Simultaneously, the orchestra was recording the theme music in our audio video studios

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:45.960
at Patterson.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.400
Brothers and sisters from all over the world contributed with their skills, but a television

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.800
studio is no good without content.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:04.020
Video productions were immediately started by the film crews, scripts had to be prepared,

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:30.180
and reenactment scheduled.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.300
When the set was finished, the equipment installed, and the videos completed, the team started

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:55.930
rehearsing the program that you are now watching.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.169
We asked an industry professional how long it would normally take to complete a studio

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:03.849
and project of this size.

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:09.729
He said without hesitating, at least a year and a half.

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:18.089
At our hardworking brothers and sisters accomplished this monumental task in just two months.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:24.410
This just emphasizes the fact that when Jehovah wants something done, there is nothing

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.170
that can stop him.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:33.970
Some of the materials and all of the work on this studio were donated, which we very

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.970
much appreciate.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:42.769
Still as you can see, there was a significant outlay of funds to complete the project.

00:04:42.769 --> 00:04:49.209
Some of you may be wondering why we would embark on a project like this here in Brooklyn

00:04:49.209 --> 00:04:55.290
knowing full well that in a little over two years, Jehovah willing, we will be moving

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.689
World Headquarters to Warwick, New York.

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:08.050
Number one, we wanted you brothers and sisters to benefit from this initiative as soon as possible.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.730
And two, everything acquired and purchased for this studio will be transferred to the

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:21.170
Warwick area except the paint on the walls and the paint on the floor.

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:27.209
So really, it is an investment that we are hopeful with your support can be used on

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:28.689
into the years ahead.
