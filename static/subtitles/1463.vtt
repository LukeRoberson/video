00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:11.539
Jehovah's Witnesses are known around the world for preaching the good news of the kingdom.

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:15.779
How is this work accomplished here in Indonesia?

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:19.100
It is certainly a challenging assignment.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.339
This life-saving message needs to be brought to over 250 million people living on thousands

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:26.739
of different islands.

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:32.140
To support this tremendous work, the Indonesia branch office was relocated to the 31st floor

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.969
of the Central Park Building in Jakarta in April 2014.

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.890
A number of apartments at an adjacent apartment tower are being used to house the Bethel family,

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.079
which has approximately 100 members that support the work of the branch office.

00:00:49.079 --> 00:01:01.320
Each morning they commute to this office, ready for their work assignments.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.200
We call this place Bethel, which means House of God.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.599
By means of this brief video presentation, we would like to warmly welcome you to our branch

00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:18.349
office in Bethel home and provide you with an overview of what is being accomplished here.

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:23.950
Our day always starts with a morning worship program at 7.20 a.m.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.909
What is being considered?

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.069
Every day an interesting Bible verse is being read, commented on, and explained so as to

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:37.510
make its practical value clear to the Bethel family.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.269
After a closing prayer, all are ready to start working.

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:45.150
Did you like to know what the Bethel family is doing?

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.799
Let's have a look at a few of the activities being done here.

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.920
Our receptionist welcomes our many visitors in the main lobby and will make arrangements

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.439
for tours.

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.000
Also, all incoming calls are answered here, and some additional secretarial work is done

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.060
whenever time permits.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.219
An ever-growing work at our branch is related to audio and video recordings.

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:14.740
In addition to Indonesian language material, in recent years we have started recording

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.340
in many indigenous languages as well.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.500
What is being recorded?

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.979
A wide variety of publications and audio format, as well as convention dramas, videos, and

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.699
web materials.

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:31.419
The process is very involved.

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:37.060
Readers and voice participants are auditioned, selected, and coached.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.780
Hours are spent doing the actual recording.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.419
Next, the material is reviewed and edited to achieve the best possible quality.

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:52.020
When satisfied, the final product will be uploaded to JW.org for the benefit of you

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.419
and millions of other people all around the world.

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:02.699
Producing publications in many different languages, whether an electronic or printed format,

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:05.780
requires translation.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.580
Some of this work is done at our branch office.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:15.300
The translation process can be challenging, but it is a very important and rewarding work.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.500
Teams of translators work hard every day to keep up with a steady flow of new material.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.139
They are trained to translate the English text into Indonesian.

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:31.569
They are also provided with various research tools.

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.449
The English text is also made available to local language teams located at remote translation

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:40.330
offices or RTOs throughout the country.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:46.250
It is then translated into Indonesian sign language and many other local languages.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.770
This entire translation process can take weeks or even months to complete, and even then

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.969
the work is not yet done.

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:55.729
What's next?

00:03:55.729 --> 00:04:00.490
The translated text is now ready for the composition process, where a print-ready file

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.610
is created.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:10.180
Most of our publications are printed at the Japan branch office of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.539
The completeness is also observed in the Bethel Residences and offices.

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:19.540
Each Bethel family member is responsible for cleaning their own room.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:28.209
Housekeepers assist the family by cleaning each residence room once a month.

00:04:28.209 --> 00:04:32.850
Besides the kitchen and laundry operations, the Bethel office is responsible for organizing

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:43.509
spiritual programs and for the overall management of all branch office properties.

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:47.069
Back at the office, more work is being accomplished.

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:51.269
Most of letters and reports from the field are received on a weekly basis.

00:04:51.269 --> 00:04:53.829
Where is this correspondence handled?

00:04:53.829 --> 00:04:58.589
Here in the service department, they are responsible to communicate with and direct the activities

00:04:58.589 --> 00:05:00.069
in the field.

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:05.189
They also handle the organizing of various Bible schools, conventions, assemblies, and

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:10.029
approve the formation of new congregations and groups.

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:13.629
Interest shown in our Bible educational work is followed up carefully.

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:17.449
When someone requests a visit from Jehovah's Witnesses by filling out the form on the

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:23.069
jw.org website, brothers locate the nearest congregation and inform them in order to send

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:31.420
someone as soon as possible.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.540
All this work would be much harder to accomplish without the use of technology.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:41.420
Therefore, a vital part of our operation here is the computer department.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.379
Existing systems need to be maintained and upgraded.

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:49.420
New equipment is bought and installed, not only at the branch office, but also at satellite

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.899
locations and remote translation offices.

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:58.060
As a result of the good news being preached, there is a growing need for more dignified

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.860
places of worship.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:05.139
The building of such kingdom halls is organized by the local design construction department.

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:10.379
Along with new construction, the LDC is responsible for overseeing the renovation and maintenance

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:14.540
of existing kingdom halls, as well as maintenance training.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.939
In addition to kingdom hall upkeep, this department is involved with searching for properties

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:24.769
to be used as RTOs or missionary homes.

00:06:24.769 --> 00:06:29.810
Operating our branch office facilities requires a constant supply of various items.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.649
The purchasing department cares for this responsibility by managing vendor accounts and receiving

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:36.170
shipments.

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:43.360
These goods are then processed and sent to the branch facilities where they are needed.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.839
Some activities need to be handled administratively and legally.

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:49.920
Who is doing this?

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.720
The governing body appoints a branch committee who, in turn, receives the support of office

00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:00.199
personnel to see to it that guidelines and instructions are being implemented appropriately

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:02.680
and in a timely manner.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.279
This includes giving attention to those in need when natural disasters strike.

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:15.060
The legal department makes sure that all legal requirements are being fulfilled.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.100
As you have just seen, much is being accomplished here at Bethel.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:24.019
And amazingly, all of this is being accomplished by volunteers who have dedicated themselves

00:07:24.019 --> 00:07:28.100
fully to support the Kingdom Preaching Work here in Indonesia.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:33.019
We thank you for your visit and sincerely hope you will enjoy touring our branch office.
