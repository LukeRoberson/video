00:02:14.699 --> 00:03:31.020
I start my day, when I wake up the sun, I eat by the streets, the eyes full of sleep, I pray, I smile at the passing,

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:50.020
In the evening, we sleep, the sun stops in the rest of the night, my eyes look like this, I choose this,

00:03:50.020 --> 00:04:25.730
What I want, I'm ready, at the end of your night,

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:44.180
I finish my day, when I sleep, tired, but happy, I have no choice but to appear, I pray I have life,

00:04:44.180 --> 00:05:20.750
who prays to me, when I wake up the sun stops in the rest of the night,

00:05:20.750 --> 00:07:54.079
I finish my day, when I wake up the sun, I eat by the streets,
