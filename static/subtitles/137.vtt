00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:07.500
The governing body has approved my addressing something that Jesus Himself spoke of on a number

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.259
of occasions.

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:15.019
And I might say at the outset, this is by no means a pessimistic speech meant to discourage

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:16.339
anyone.

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:21.339
It is a realistic discussion that we all need to be prepared for.

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:24.820
The topic is persecution.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.500
It can come in many forms, some are very subtle means to discourage a servant of God.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:39.450
Others are more direct forms of opposition, but not unexpected.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.329
The Apostle Paul, in the first century CE, describes certain men who oppose the early

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.649
Christian congregation.

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:53.429
He reminded loyal followers of Jesus about the persecutions and sufferings he experienced

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:55.670
in multiple cities.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.750
His follow-up words in 2 Timothy 312 are the theme for this material.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.950
Here Paul shows that persecution would not be the experience of just a select few.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:17.510
He said in 2 Timothy 312, in fact, all, yes, all, those designed to live with godly

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:24.469
devotion and association with Christ Jesus, will also be persecuted.

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:29.269
While we don't want to become unduly disturbed about what we might or might not face in

00:01:29.269 --> 00:01:36.349
the future, at the same time, we don't want to be unprepared when opposition suddenly

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:42.069
rears its ugly head.

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:47.469
Jesus openly discussed the possibility of persecution with his disciples.

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:53.310
One classic example of that is found at John 15, 20, and 21.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:04.540
If you have your Bible at hand, please open to John 15, 20, and 21.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:12.819
He said, keep in mind the word I said to you, a slave is not greater than his master.

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.939
If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you.

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:22.020
If they have observed my word, they will also observe yours.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:28.340
But they will do all these things against you on account of my name because they do not

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.379
know the one who sent me.

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.860
It's difficult to misconstrue those words, isn't it?

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:45.939
Jesus said, persecution is going to happen, therefore we need to be prepared.

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:50.219
What are some forms of persecution we might expect?

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:56.180
As mentioned, it could be subtle forms such as negative talk about our beliefs or sarcastic

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.460
comments by schoolmates or workmates.

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:08.819
However, Jesus himself itemized more alt-right forms of persecution at Luke 21, 12 through 19.

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:17.030
Find Luke 21, 12 through 19.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.150
We might mention that here, Jesus was not referring to what would happen back then in the

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.909
first century.

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.229
This was a prophecy about the future.

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:33.949
He was describing what would transpire now before the end of the evil system under Satan's

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:35.430
control.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.389
So we expect to see an increase in such malicious opposition.

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:47.389
It is in that context that Jesus warns us of four different kinds of persecution originating

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.669
from various sources.

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.789
Luke 21, starting in verse 12.

00:03:54.789 --> 00:04:01.189
But before all these things happen, people will lay their hands on you and persecute you,

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:04.389
handing you over to the synagogues and prisons.

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:08.870
You'll be brought before kings and governors for the sake of my name.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:15.229
Now, skip down to verses 16 and 17.

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:22.149
Moreover you'll be handed over, even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and

00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:24.509
they'll put some of you to death.

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:30.790
And you'll be hated by all people because of my name.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:36.709
Family persecution is sometimes the most heart-wrenching because of natural familial ties that

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:37.709
exist.

00:04:37.709 --> 00:04:45.230
But did you notice, in verse 12, Jesus said some would be handed over to prisons?

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.550
That has been the situation for many of our brothers in pre-Christian and Christian times.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.949
For example, in the April broadcasting program, brother Sanderson reviewed the situation

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.790
faced by our young brothers in Korea.

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.069
The RN and out of prison because of their neutral stand.

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:10.910
What marvelous examples for any of us who come face-to-face with the same treatment because

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.550
of changing religious or political wins.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.910
We came across an archive video of another faithful brother who endured four and a half

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.750
years in prison in China.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:29.360
This is an interview from the past with brother Harold King.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.360
I saw a policeman coming into the lane and they were, as if they were facing a machine-gun

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.360
attack or something.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:42.480
They were creeping along the wall on the other side and running up into the lane.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.759
And so I said, Stanley, someone's going to get picked up this morning.

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:50.680
Now, look at the police are in the lane because we've been seeing this quite often.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.439
They were picking up people all over the city.

00:05:53.439 --> 00:06:03.519
So what we did, we were just going to get on with our breakfast anyway when bang, bang,

00:06:03.519 --> 00:06:05.920
bang on our back door.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.519
And I said, Stanley, it's us.

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:09.360
They're after us this morning.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.360
But we couldn't.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.120
They couldn't find anything.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.279
They did take the files because we'd hidden nothing.

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:22.560
And the thing is, we didn't have to worry too much because they had to spy in the congregation.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.519
They gave them all the information they wanted before they came and arrested us.

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:33.240
That fellow was originally my Bible study when he was a university student.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.519
I thought what a dirty little rotter that fellow has turned out to be.

00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:41.839
And I looked straight at his face and he wouldn't look at mine.

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:44.519
He hung his head.

00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:48.480
He said, what do you know this man?

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.720
And he said, yes, he was my teacher.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.199
What did he teach you?

00:06:53.199 --> 00:07:01.639
He taught me that the Chinese people's government was of the devil and that it was going to be destroyed.

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:05.920
And all who supported would be destroyed along with it.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.160
He said to me, is that what you taught him?

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.399
I said, well, I'd like to qualify that.

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:17.000
I sat there on the floor. I had no bed.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.360
I had no chair. I'd only got a concrete floor.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.319
I'd got a room four and a half by nine.

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:26.040
And all I was in the corner was a bucket like that.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.040
I wouldn't bucket it that with the bands around it.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.160
That was my restroom.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:37.079
And the situation was full, the cell was full of ermine.

00:07:37.079 --> 00:07:42.199
They got bugs, bedbugs crawling in there and I was bitten all over.

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:50.079
I hadn't had any food since that breakfast and here it was now I wasn't going to get any of that night.

00:07:50.079 --> 00:07:52.079
I used my time in the cell.

00:07:52.079 --> 00:07:55.759
I wasn't going to sit there on the floor full of self-pity.

00:07:55.759 --> 00:07:58.480
I was going to go preaching.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.240
If they wouldn't let me do anything, I could do something.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.000
I could practice my presentations.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.759
So each corner of the cell became a door.

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:12.160
And I would start off and go to this door and witness.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.360
And I made it quite real from experiences that I had.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.839
Not every corner was interested.

00:08:17.839 --> 00:08:23.680
This one was very interested and this one turned out to be a return visit and a Bible study.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:29.199
And I got a Bible study going, I didn't turn in a field service report.

00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:33.159
But it kept my mind on the scriptures.

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:36.720
And I had no other way of doing that.

00:08:36.759 --> 00:08:38.399
I could have compromised.

00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:42.320
They told me, you see, they wouldn't let me cut my hair.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.840
They wouldn't let me shave.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.200
They wouldn't let me pair my nails.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.120
And I couldn't get proper exercise.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:56.120
And they kept saying, if you will only confess to your spies,

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.679
no, I would, that would be betrayal.

00:08:58.679 --> 00:09:02.840
And that was the last thing I wanted to do.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.600
I had a lovely relationship with Jehovah God.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.440
I loved him very dearly.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.279
He was real.

00:09:08.279 --> 00:09:10.039
He wasn't fictitious.

00:09:10.039 --> 00:09:13.240
And the whole organization, the angels,

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:17.519
and all the fine work of Paul, James, Peter, John,

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:20.559
the earnestness for which they kept the work going,

00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:23.480
it was my privilege to do that now.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.279
And they were my examples and I followed them.

00:09:26.279 --> 00:09:32.460
So never at any time did I think of trying to find an easy way out.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.980
Well, I prayed to Jehovah then and I said,

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.740
Jehovah, I want to be able to celebrate the memory

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.700
with my brothers outside.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:47.379
So could I see the moon on that night?

00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:53.379
And if it wasn't the full moon, I don't, don't let me see it.

00:09:53.379 --> 00:09:56.379
Well, there were cloudy nights and there were bright nights.

00:09:56.379 --> 00:10:00.460
But this particular night on that first nice and 14,

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:02.820
there wasn't a question about it.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:07.259
It seemed almost as if Jehovah had polished up that moon.

00:10:07.259 --> 00:10:12.460
And then I gave the memorial talk to an imaginary kingdom

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.820
awful of brothers.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:20.299
And I gave it through when I came to the point of passing the emblems.

00:10:20.299 --> 00:10:23.899
I would just ask Jehovah's blessing on the bread.

00:10:23.899 --> 00:10:27.460
And I'd pick up the saucer and make a pretence

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.740
of passing it around and bringing it back

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.500
and making a pretence of taking a piece of myself.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.779
And then I'd put it down and I would ask

00:10:35.779 --> 00:10:40.419
Jehovah's blessing on the cup and do the same with my normal mug

00:10:40.419 --> 00:10:43.460
and send it and then come back and make the pretence

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:48.059
of drinking it and prayed Jehovah would accept that.

00:10:48.059 --> 00:10:51.460
I don't like the word depress because I never was depressed.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:55.500
But there were days when I felt things could go a little better

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.500
than they were going.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:02.019
So I thought something like this.

00:11:02.019 --> 00:11:05.460
Oh, come all you slaves of Jehovah

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:10.259
on high who've given your heart to your God.

00:11:10.259 --> 00:11:13.460
Out to the work you've been given to do

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:17.379
in the footsteps that Jesus Christ brought.

00:11:17.379 --> 00:11:19.899
And then that song came.

00:11:19.899 --> 00:11:21.899
And I used to get better.

00:11:21.899 --> 00:11:25.820
And a very fact of singing that song lifted me up out

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:29.320
of the loose bell.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.799
I was exalted.

00:11:31.799 --> 00:11:36.840
I was exhilarated in realizing that just

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.600
across the other side of the bridge

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.240
for the British consulate general with my passport.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.480
And outside there were team of brothers

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.120
that had come up to meet me from the branch.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.480
And I would be with him again.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:56.320
I was emotionally almost weeping with the joy

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.879
of being among them again.

00:11:58.879 --> 00:12:01.879
We just got bare hugs all around.

00:12:01.879 --> 00:12:04.679
And they were so happy.

00:12:04.679 --> 00:12:10.879
And all the way home, they were asking questions how it was.

00:12:10.879 --> 00:12:12.399
And I was able to talk to them.

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:14.759
And by the time I did get down there,

00:12:14.759 --> 00:12:18.879
I was getting a bit horse because I'd been talking.

00:12:18.879 --> 00:12:24.879
And I was so sort of wound up time being free again.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.919
And I was taking everything in as I went along.

00:12:28.919 --> 00:12:31.799
And I realized the beauty of Hong Kong at that time

00:12:31.799 --> 00:12:35.850
and the work that was being done there.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:41.009
Faith is based on accurate knowledge.

00:12:41.009 --> 00:12:45.850
And the only accurate knowledge available regarding

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:52.409
the purpose of creation is that contained in the Bible.

00:12:52.409 --> 00:12:54.690
So it is a case.

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.529
I would say a new one.

00:12:56.529 --> 00:12:59.289
Now I'm telling the brothers everywhere,

00:12:59.289 --> 00:13:02.129
get that Bible off its sprinted page

00:13:02.129 --> 00:13:04.090
and get it into your heart.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:05.490
And then you got it.

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:07.289
And it's a living word.

00:13:07.289 --> 00:13:10.049
And it will keep you strong in the faith.

00:13:10.049 --> 00:13:12.250
Where else can you go?

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.370
There's, look at the world of state that it's in today.

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:19.169
There's no haven anywhere in this world.

00:13:19.169 --> 00:13:26.179
But there's a wonderful haven among your hopeless people.

00:13:26.179 --> 00:13:29.179
Brother King endured the persecution.

00:13:29.179 --> 00:13:30.580
He was later released.

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:36.299
And since his death in January of 1993, we are confident.

00:13:36.299 --> 00:13:40.659
He is ruling as a king with Jesus in heaven.

00:13:40.659 --> 00:13:43.539
Was his endurance worth the sacrifice?

00:13:43.539 --> 00:13:46.139
Absolutely.

00:13:46.139 --> 00:13:48.100
What is another form of persecution

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:51.500
that Jesus specifically mentioned?

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:55.179
At Matthew 5.11 he said that people will persecute you

00:13:55.179 --> 00:13:58.659
and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing

00:13:58.659 --> 00:14:01.419
against you for my sake.

00:14:01.419 --> 00:14:04.860
Lies are particularly hurtful because they

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:10.019
misrepresent the true nature of a person or organization.

00:14:10.019 --> 00:14:13.340
They're often started with malicious intent.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.620
But then they might be picked up by the news media

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:17.980
and published as if factual.

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:22.379
When in reality many of the facts never come to light.

00:14:22.379 --> 00:14:26.980
Jesus indicated that no matter what his followers did,

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:30.340
they would be criticized and misrepresented

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.580
by people who speak untruths.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:39.059
As an example, at Matthew 11.18 he said of John the Baptist,

00:14:39.059 --> 00:14:41.179
he came neither eating nor drinking,

00:14:41.179 --> 00:14:43.980
but people say he has a demon.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:48.659
Then in the next verse, Matthew 11.19,

00:14:48.659 --> 00:14:52.539
Jesus commented on his own very different approach

00:14:52.539 --> 00:14:54.500
to the basics of life.

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:59.019
Jesus did not follow the strict dietary restrictions of John.

00:14:59.019 --> 00:15:02.620
Jesus was also known to drink wine and moderation.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:07.379
The opposite approach of John who was criticized for his behavior,

00:15:07.379 --> 00:15:11.179
what lying accusations did Jesus have to face?

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:20.279
Matthew 11.19 says, the son of man did come eating and drinking,

00:15:20.279 --> 00:15:23.960
but people say, look, a man who is a glutton

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:27.039
and is given to drinking wine, a friend of tax collectors

00:15:27.039 --> 00:15:29.879
and sinners.

00:15:29.879 --> 00:15:33.480
As in the first century, we are criticized by some,

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:37.720
no matter what we do, but notice the significant comment

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.399
of Jesus at the end of that verse.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:45.279
He said, all the same, wisdom is proved righteous

00:15:45.279 --> 00:15:47.480
by its works.

00:15:48.679 --> 00:15:52.360
In other words, people in general can usually see

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:56.919
right through the exaggerated stories and outright lies.

00:15:56.919 --> 00:15:59.600
They know our good motives and good works

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:06.529
and our true reputation remains intact.

00:16:06.529 --> 00:16:08.769
While we may take advantage of legal means

00:16:08.769 --> 00:16:11.690
to set the record straight in harmony with Jesus' words,

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:15.769
we do not engage in smear campaigns with rebuttals

00:16:15.769 --> 00:16:18.769
either verbally or in print.

00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:22.210
Instead, we continue to go about our peaceful work

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:24.570
for the good of humanity.

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:27.929
This includes sharing the Bible's message with all people

00:16:27.929 --> 00:16:32.889
helping them to better their lives spiritually and morally.

00:16:32.889 --> 00:16:37.129
We translate that message in some 700 languages,

00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:40.529
some of which we've never even heard of before.

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:43.450
We go to great lengths to help the blind and the deaf

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:46.289
with publications they can comprehend,

00:16:46.289 --> 00:16:50.490
even though these are produced at significant cost.

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:53.649
In fact, we produce video publications

00:16:53.649 --> 00:16:57.450
in some 80 different sign languages.

00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:59.330
Jesus was right.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:03.210
Wisdom is proved righteous by its works.

00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:06.690
But what are some of the erroneous ideas

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:10.769
that are seized upon and at times publicized by the media?

00:17:11.769 --> 00:17:14.690
Some municipalities misinterpret our intent

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:17.809
and spread lies about the nature of our public ministry.

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.490
Commendably, however, in many lands

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:23.970
the law supports our freedom of speech and worship

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:27.210
and our persistence is actually set a precedent

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:30.089
for others to enjoy similar freedoms.

00:17:30.089 --> 00:17:32.490
At times, lies are spread about our view

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:35.490
of medical intervention when sick.

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:38.289
For example, reports are circulated

00:17:38.289 --> 00:17:40.250
that we let our children die

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:42.970
rather than seeking medical help for them.

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:46.250
Nothing could be further from the truth.

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:51.250
Instead, an isolated incident is blown out of proportion

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:55.009
than emotion and drama are added as fuel

00:17:55.009 --> 00:17:56.970
and then this is fed to the press.

00:17:58.009 --> 00:18:01.329
The impression circulated is so inaccurate

00:18:01.329 --> 00:18:04.009
that it could only be labeled a bold face lie.

00:18:05.009 --> 00:18:09.529
We want the best possible medical care for our children.

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:12.130
Of course, we leave it up to the parents

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:14.490
to determine what type of treatment

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:20.740
will best care for their child's health condition.

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:25.539
As we've just discussed, persecution can come in many forms.

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.019
We do not need to try to imagine the various forms

00:18:29.019 --> 00:18:30.740
that it might take in the future.

00:18:31.539 --> 00:18:35.859
However, to cope successfully with whatever might come

00:18:35.859 --> 00:18:39.460
our way, we need to be aware of the possibility.

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.900
That is what our program is highlighting this month.

00:18:43.619 --> 00:18:47.299
We are grateful that Jehovah has forewarned us in his word

00:18:47.299 --> 00:18:50.900
and that Jesus made such pointed observations on the subject.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:56.339
Please locate with me Isaiah 28 verse 16.

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:01.140
The Apostle Peter, first Peter 2, 6 under inspiration,

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.980
made clear that this ancient prophecy pointed forward

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:07.859
to Jesus who had become the cornerstone

00:19:07.859 --> 00:19:10.619
and foundation of the Christian congregation.

00:19:11.579 --> 00:19:15.460
If we exercise full faith in Jesus, what will be our attitude

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.180
and resolve regarding future opposition,

00:19:19.019 --> 00:19:21.500
read with me Isaiah 28 16.

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:27.579
Therefore, this is what the sovereign, Lord Jehovah says.

00:19:28.539 --> 00:19:32.420
Here I am laying as a foundation and Zion attested stone,

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.980
the precious cornerstone of a sure foundation.

00:19:36.619 --> 00:19:39.700
No one exercising faith will panic.

00:19:41.099 --> 00:19:42.259
How are you sure?

00:19:43.259 --> 00:19:47.140
Jesus is a solid foundation giving us stability,

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:50.900
no matter what we might face now or in the future.

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:54.099
There is no need to panic.

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:58.259
In fact, when considering the secure solid foundation

00:19:58.259 --> 00:20:02.339
of the Christ, please note the strength we derive

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:08.859
from his example as said fourth in Ephesians 3, 16 through 21.

00:20:10.059 --> 00:20:13.299
Even if we are timid by nature, these verses make clear

00:20:13.299 --> 00:20:17.539
that we can be made mighty in the person we are inside.

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:18.460
How?

00:20:19.779 --> 00:20:21.980
By having the Christ dwell in our hearts.

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:25.619
Notice how beautifully this inspired point

00:20:25.619 --> 00:20:29.299
has made it Ephesians chapter 3, starting in verse 16.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:34.380
I pray that He may grant you through the abundance of His glory

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:38.180
to be made mighty in the man you are inside with power

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.740
through His Spirit, and that through your faith,

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.380
you may have the Christ dwell in your hearts with love.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:50.480
And what kind of stability will embedding Jesus' disposition

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.079
into our heart, providers?

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:56.680
That verse continues, may you be rooted

00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.119
and established on the foundation in order that

00:21:00.119 --> 00:21:03.279
with all the holy ones, you may be thoroughly able

00:21:03.279 --> 00:21:06.880
to comprehend fully what is the breadth and length

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.000
and height and depth.

00:21:10.799 --> 00:21:14.519
Our spiritual peripheral vision will be enhanced.

00:21:15.079 --> 00:21:18.160
We will comprehend more fully our circumstances.

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.559
Better than we could have had we relied simply

00:21:21.559 --> 00:21:23.519
on our own imperfect perspective.

00:21:24.519 --> 00:21:27.759
And what about being able to endure any persecution

00:21:27.759 --> 00:21:28.680
that comes our way?

00:21:29.559 --> 00:21:35.079
We absolutely can, but not by our own strength.

00:21:35.599 --> 00:21:38.920
Read with me now verses 20 and 21.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.920
Now to the one who can, according to his power

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:46.839
that is operating in us, do more than super abundantly

00:21:46.839 --> 00:21:49.640
beyond all the things we ask or conceive.

00:21:50.359 --> 00:21:52.960
To him be the glory by means of the congregation

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.680
and by means of Christ Jesus, 12 generations forever

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.319
and ever, amen.

00:22:00.279 --> 00:22:05.119
We echo, amen to those insightful and strengthening words

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.319
from our God.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.680
For him to do super abundantly beyond what we need

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.240
is special indeed.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:17.920
But did you notice it said he will do more than super abundantly

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.640
beyond all the things we ask?

00:22:21.319 --> 00:22:24.799
And that is why ordinary people very much like you

00:22:24.799 --> 00:22:27.960
and I have endured extraordinary opposition

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.960
and have come through on Jehovah's side of the issue.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:35.599
For all of you integrity keepers to Jehovah be the glory

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:39.799
by means of Christ Jesus to all generations forever

00:22:39.799 --> 00:22:41.559
and ever, amen.
