00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:35.579
We warmly welcome all of you to this edition of JW Broadcasting. March 8th, 2025, graduation day for the 157th class of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:43.579
54 graduates from 28 countries completed months of intense Bible instruction.

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:55.579
Before receiving their diplomas, what parting words of encouragement did they receive from members of the governing body, their instructors, and other experienced brothers?

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:05.579
We are pleased to share with you parts from that graduation program, which was held at the Watchtower Educational Center in Patterson, New York.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:18.400
So dear Gilead students, this is your day. Can you believe it? Graduation day, March 8th, 2025.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:26.400
It seems like just yesterday you were being introduced to the Bethel family, but how quickly five months passes.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.400
Today you will become graduates, and we're thrilled to be here with you on this special day.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:50.400
Of course, this day will have highs and lows. Maybe as you think about departing, separating from your class 157 family, you become closer than brothers and sisters during this time.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.400
It will be bittersweet, perhaps, as you contemplate departing.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.400
One recent graduate expressed it as like having a wedding and a funeral in the same day.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:11.960
But during the past five months, you've developed a spiritual feeding program like no other.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.819
Study and preparation in advance of each day in the classroom. You remember the intensity.

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:26.819
You remember the blood, the sweat, the tears in a sense as you prepared for classes, as you prepared for tests.

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:34.819
The challenge of keeping up with all of that. Well, maybe the last couple of days you've gone through Gilead withdrawal in a sense.

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:43.819
For that reason, in my introductory comments, I would like to address the theme, stay hungry, stay thirsty.

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:54.819
First, stay hungry. Let's consider two things that you should continue to hunger for moving forward in your sacred service to Jehovah.

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.819
I invite you to open to Matthew chapter 5, and notice with me, please, verse 3.

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:06.819
And you know what this verse says. Jesus Sermon on the Mount, Matthew chapter 5 verse 3, there he said,

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:15.819
Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them.

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:21.819
So happier those conscious of their spiritual need or those who are beggars for the spirit as we note in the footnote.

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:30.819
We might even say those who are hungry for spiritual food, what's the point? Stay hungry.

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:40.819
Be like a bear just before hibernation. They enter a state called hyperphagia or increased appetite.

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.819
During that time period, some bears consumed 20,000 calories a day.

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:53.819
They're searching for food 20 out of 24 hours a day. Maybe during Gilead school, you were hungry as a bear.

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.819
Devouring food, eating it up spiritually, and at times literally maybe as well.

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.819
Are you hoping to shed a few pounds after you went to part school?

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:12.819
But in a spiritual sense, what's the major difference between being hungry as a bear prior to hibernation and you?

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.819
Well, you're not going into hibernation.

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:22.819
There's very little downtime between the end of class and starting in your theocratic assignments.

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:27.819
You can't live off the fat, you've stored up at Gilead.

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:33.819
You can expect to face bigger tests and your assignments than you even had in the classroom.

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:41.819
So instead of a bear before hibernation, let's compare your situation to a bird before migration.

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:48.819
They too enter a state called hyperphagia, preparing them for their long flights to prepare them for the work ahead.

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:54.819
You might not be migrating, although some of you will be, yes.

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:59.819
But maybe you received a new assignment for which you need to keep strengthening your spirituality.

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:02.819
What's the key to success?

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:04.819
Stay hungry.

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:06.819
Stay hungry.

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:08.819
Will Jehovah satisfy your hunger?

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:10.819
Well, what can we learn from a miracle that Jesus performed?

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:16.819
If you turn to John chapter 6, notice with me please verse 11.

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:20.819
One of Jesus' miracles where he fed a multitude.

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:22.819
John chapter 6 verse 11.

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:26.819
And again, the question, will Jehovah satisfy your spiritual hunger?

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:28.819
Notice what's expressed here, John 6 verse 11.

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:33.819
Jesus took the bread and after giving thanks, he distributed it to those who were sitting there.

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:42.160
He did likewise with the small fish and they had as much as they wanted.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:49.569
Jesus multiplied five loaves and two fish and fed possibly over 15,000 people.

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:53.569
How many people is he feeding spiritually in our day?

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:55.569
Millions?

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:00.699
What was the result?

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:04.699
Back then, they had as much as they wanted.

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:06.699
And so that's true of you as well.

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:07.699
Stay hungry.

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:09.699
Continue to feed spiritually.

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:11.699
You can have as much as you want.

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:14.699
For instance, what's available in JW Library alone?

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:17.699
Over 330 morning worship programs.

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:22.699
Over 10 years of broadcasts, that's more than 120 hours of spiritual food.

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:26.699
Three complete years of regional conventions from 20 to 2022.

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:29.699
We can watch them again if we choose.

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:33.699
That's just some of the video content not to mention audio, including music.

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:35.699
And what about written publications?

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:38.699
Well, the Watchtower magazines go back to 1950.

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:43.699
The Wake magazines go back to 1970.

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:47.699
1,815 Watchtower magazines are available.

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:53.699
1,011 Wake magazines are available just in JW Library.

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:58.699
Is Jehovah through his son providing meat and do season?

00:06:58.699 --> 00:06:59.699
Absolutely.

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:06.699
Isaiah 256 that says that in this mountain, Jehovah of Armies will make for all the people a banquet of rich dishes,

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:11.699
a banquet of fine wine, of rich dishes filled with marrow, of fine filtered wine.

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:14.699
We are well fed spiritually.

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:17.699
We can have as much as we want.

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:22.699
Jehovah through his son provided in the first century.

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:28.699
Jehovah through his son is providing spiritually for his people in our day.

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:30.699
Stay hungry.

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:34.699
Now, do you ever eat your favorite meal and say,

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:36.699
I'll never have that again?

00:07:36.699 --> 00:07:39.699
No, we keep coming back.

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:41.699
So what's the point in a spiritual sense?

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:47.699
Well, we can continue to feed on some of the things that we've enjoyed in the past.

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:50.699
Although we like to hear new things, maybe refinements in our understanding,

00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:53.699
it's good to go back and review what we already know.

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:56.699
To drive in the nails, so to speak.

00:07:56.699 --> 00:07:57.699
What's the point?

00:07:57.699 --> 00:08:00.699
Well, although we like to hear new things at times,

00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:03.699
go back to your Gilead notes.

00:08:03.699 --> 00:08:06.699
Continue to drive in the nails.

00:08:06.699 --> 00:08:07.699
Stay hungry.

00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:10.699
Never become satiated or fully satisfied.

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:14.699
At the end of a study period, crave the next study period.

00:08:14.699 --> 00:08:15.699
What's next on the menu?

00:08:15.699 --> 00:08:18.699
That's our hunger for spiritual food.

00:08:18.699 --> 00:08:21.699
Let's consider one more hunger.

00:08:21.699 --> 00:08:27.589
If you're still there in Matthew, notice Jesus' words in verse 6.

00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:34.590
Happy are those hungering and thirsting for righteousness since they will be hill.

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:36.590
He filled.

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:37.590
So who are such ones?

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:42.590
The study note says that those who long to see corruption and injustice replaced

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:47.590
with God's standards of right and wrong, they strive to conform to those standards.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.590
So what's the point?

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.590
Stay hungry for Jehovah's righteousness.

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:55.590
And how does Jehovah satisfy our hunger for righteousness?

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.590
One watchtower stated this,

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:02.590
spiritual hunger and thirst for righteousness will be fully satisfied in the new world.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:06.590
So we keep an expectation.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.590
Another watchtower stated,

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:16.590
let us not lose heart or be amazed that oppression and violence have taken away righteousness in this satanic world.

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:23.590
So we do not become insensitive to the circumstances, the unrighteousness of this world.

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:28.590
We avoid the path of the ridiculers mentioned in 2 Peter 3 verse 4,

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.590
who say,

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:34.590
all things are continuing exactly as they were from creations beginning.

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.590
No!

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:46.590
The world's moral decay is evidence that God's kingdom and His righteousness are close at hand and how we take comfort in that.

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:51.590
Stay hungry for God's righteousness confident that you will be filled.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.590
So dear Gilead students,

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:56.590
stay hungry for spiritual food.

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:59.590
Stay hungry for God's righteousness.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:01.590
What about stay thirsty?

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:04.590
Well, we'll talk about that at the end of the program.

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:14.879
The next part of our program is something we always look forward to, the inside story.

00:10:14.879 --> 00:10:24.879
So this one will feature interviews of Gilead students from branches that care for nearly 25% of the publishers worldwide.

00:10:24.879 --> 00:10:28.879
Brother Trent Lipold, another of the Gilead instructors will care for the interviews.

00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:30.879
Which countries are these?

00:10:30.879 --> 00:10:31.879
Let's watch.

00:11:02.289 --> 00:11:04.289
Welcome to the inside story.

00:11:04.289 --> 00:11:11.289
In the book of Acts chapter 1 verse 8, Jesus said to His disciples that they would be witnesses of Him to the most distant part of the earth.

00:11:11.289 --> 00:11:18.289
And today we are going to meet guests from the 157th class who are serving in distant parts of the earth.

00:11:18.289 --> 00:11:36.850
So let's meet our first guest, Brother Fernando Samal from Brazil.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:37.850
Welcome Fernando.

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:38.850
Thank you.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.850
It's good to have you on the inside story.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:41.850
You come from Brazil.

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:43.850
You're serving at the branch there in Sao Paulo.

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:44.850
Yes.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:48.850
I know there is a place in Brazil that is very close to your heart.

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:49.850
Yes.

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:51.850
I love the Amazon region.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:55.850
So what is it about the Amazon region, Fernando?

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:58.850
Maybe two words, the people.

00:11:58.850 --> 00:11:59.850
Nice.

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:01.850
They are amazing.

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:02.850
I'm interested.

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:04.850
What is it about the people there?

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:06.850
They really accept the truth.

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:13.850
They have a good inclination to serve Jehovah or to hear about God.

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:21.850
And it's amazing because we are able to preach to them all the time.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:24.850
So what is it like to actually preach to them?

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:26.850
What's it like to converse with them?

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:33.850
We can talk about many different matters, but since they live in the middle of the jungle,

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:38.850
the middle of the creation that Jehovah made to us,

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:41.850
we can use that to help them.

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:48.850
And of course, they face some challenges that the new world will solve.

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:52.850
And this can be the matter that we talk with them.

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:53.850
Nice.

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:58.850
Now, how is it that you first visited the Amazon?

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:01.850
I've been there many years ago.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:07.850
We received in our house one brother that went to MTS in Sao Paulo.

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:11.850
And he was serving that time in a boat over there.

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:13.850
And he invited us to visit.

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:19.850
And I went there with my two flash brothers for the first time.

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:20.850
Nice.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:25.850
So he started the fire in you for the Amazon region.

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:29.850
Have they had preaching campaigns in the region?

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:30.850
Yes.

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:38.850
They made this a few years ago, a P campaign with a lot of good results.

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:40.850
We saw the increase over there.

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:43.850
Many people are coming to the truth.

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:46.850
New congregations, new circuits.

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:50.850
And many brothers are supporting the work over there.

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:57.850
You mentioned that something that really touched you about the brothers who participated in the preaching campaigns.

00:13:57.850 --> 00:13:59.850
Can you tell us about that?

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:03.850
A few of them decided to stay.

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:08.850
They went just to support for maybe one week or two weeks.

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:11.850
But then they noticed the need.

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:13.850
And they decided to stay.

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:14.850
They moved over there.

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:18.850
They are serving and taking the lead in the congregation.

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:21.850
For me, this is amazing.

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:24.850
I know in Brazil you have some SKE schools.

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:28.850
How is SKE even used to support the work in the Amazon region?

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:35.850
We are saving in the last years many brothers to serve over there.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:42.850
After the school, they are assigned to those congregations that they need help.

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:51.850
And it's been amazing from Jehovah, actually, to help the growing over there.

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:52.850
Very nice.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:15:00.850
Now the Brazil branch and audio video services have prepared a video about preaching in the Amazon region.

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:04.850
So I'm really looking forward to seeing what it's like there and why it's so special to you.

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:05.850
So let's enjoy it together.

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:06.850
Let's see.

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:16.919
Brazil is vast.

00:15:16.919 --> 00:15:23.919
It is the largest country in South America and the fifth largest in the world.

00:15:24.919 --> 00:15:34.919
It contains a wide range of landscapes, including wetlands, savannas, mountains and rainforests.

00:15:34.919 --> 00:15:41.919
It is home to the largest river system in the world, the mighty Amazon.

00:15:41.919 --> 00:15:46.919
We have about 920,000 publishers in Brazil.

00:15:46.919 --> 00:15:55.919
New congregations and new circuits are being formed every year with approximately 25,000 people getting baptized each year.

00:15:55.919 --> 00:15:59.919
Yes, Brazil is on fire.

00:15:59.919 --> 00:16:04.919
However, there is too much work to be done.

00:16:04.919 --> 00:16:10.919
Did you know there are more than 28 million people living in the Amazon region of Brazil

00:16:10.919 --> 00:16:15.919
and hundreds of indigenous languages are spoken.

00:16:15.919 --> 00:16:21.919
An incredible help has been the school for Kingdom evangelizers.

00:16:21.919 --> 00:16:29.919
Here in Brazil, we have two educational centers for SKE, as well as some satellite locations.

00:16:29.919 --> 00:16:34.919
In the past two years alone, 54 classes have been held.

00:16:34.919 --> 00:16:41.919
The school is very focused on the Amazon region because there's such a need there.

00:16:41.919 --> 00:16:47.919
In fact, a quarter of all graduates from Brazil go to that area.

00:16:47.919 --> 00:16:52.919
But once the graduates arrive, they are not left on their own.

00:16:52.919 --> 00:17:02.200
The local brothers teach them things like what to say or not say, how to act in certain situations.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:06.200
The teachers are the local brothers.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:12.200
The dynamics of preaching in the Amazon region involves traveling great distances.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:17.200
I remember during our first visits into the interior, the local brothers would say,

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:21.200
brother, you need more time here for us to go into the interior.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.200
And I thought, I'm already in the interior.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:33.200
Then we discover that there is an interior of the interior that involves even more days of travel and longer boat trips.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:39.200
We graduated from SKE on October 6, 2024.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:43.200
We were assigned to the Amazonist region.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:50.200
This made us a bit anxious at first because we had no idea what that area would be like,

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.200
or if we would find work or not.

00:17:54.990 --> 00:18:00.990
Honestly, we expected it to be more difficult, but it was completely the opposite.

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:06.680
We're doing really well here.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:12.279
This assignment has been a true gift for us.

00:18:12.279 --> 00:18:15.279
The local service in the Amazon is great.

00:18:15.279 --> 00:18:18.279
People are so receptive.

00:18:18.279 --> 00:18:25.279
As you can see, Brazil is a big country with a big heart to go with it.

00:18:25.279 --> 00:18:33.039
Jehovah is indeed blessing our hard-working brothers and sisters.

00:18:33.039 --> 00:18:39.039
As they joyfully share, enriching those in the remote areas of Brazil.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:18.750
That is amazing Fernando, really, really impressive.

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:22.750
The work that's going on there in that region.

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:27.750
May I ask you, what has been your longest trip to the Amazon region?

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:34.750
I've been there for more than 20 days, 20, 25 days, around that.

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:37.750
How long did it take you to get there?

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:40.750
Sometimes, more than one day by boat.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.750
This is what it calls low boat.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:48.750
We have fast boats, airplanes, but it's nice.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:50.750
You can enjoy the trip.

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.750
It's beautiful, amazing river.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:57.750
Whatever way you go to be able to preach the word, it's a great place.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:59.750
Thank you very much, Fernando.

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:02.750
Thanks for sharing your special place with us here on the Inside Story.

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:03.750
A pleasure.

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:05.750
Let's meet our next guests.

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:08.750
It's Carla and Judah Kern from Central America.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:25.380
Carla and Judah, nice to have you.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.380
You're on the Inside Story.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:32.380
You're both serving presently in Mexico at the Central America branch.

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:34.380
How long have you been in Mexico?

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:36.380
Seven years now, not too long.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:39.380
We were serving in Honduras in the field before that.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:40.380
Okay.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:44.380
I know you come from Canada, but how did you get to Honduras?

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.380
My parents.

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:51.380
Growing up, Mom and Dad were always looking for where to serve, where he was great.

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.380
We moved a lot when I was a kid.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.380
I have a brother and a sister, so our family of five

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.380
was constantly on the move.

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:03.380
And when I was 15, Mom and Dad told us,

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:07.380
we're thinking, next move, Honduras.

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:10.380
So we thought, okay, sounds fun.

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:16.380
And literally, we just packed our car, everything we could inside our car on top of our car,

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:23.380
said goodbye to our family in Canada, and drove from Canada to Honduras.

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:29.380
So as a kid, a 15-year-old Honduras became home.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:31.380
The ministry became my life.

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:34.380
I started pioneering soon after we got there.

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:37.380
And I got appointed as a special pioneer.

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:41.380
So that was really nice to be assigned to isolated areas of the country as well.

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:46.380
I got to serve on an island called Guanaja in the mosquito coast.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.380
Beautiful experiences throughout the country.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:49.380
Very nice.

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:51.380
Now, I know you told me your Dad's a planner.

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:55.380
So maybe to a 15-year-old felt like you just packed the car and left.

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:58.380
He probably did more than that, but it seemed like that.

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.380
What about you, Carla?

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:02.380
How did you get to Honduras?

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:06.380
Well, I was born in Ireland, and my parents are from England.

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:08.380
They were both in triplets.

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:12.380
When they were younger, they moved to Ireland to serve where they knew it was greater.

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:15.380
They met there, got married, started special pioneering together.

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:20.380
And when my brother and I came along, they carried on special pioneering together with us.

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:23.380
So we were raised in the ministry.

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:27.380
They really loved it, and they helped us to love it as well.

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:32.380
So when I moved away from home after I finished school, I started pioneering.

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:36.380
Yeah, I just carried on enjoying the ministry.

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:42.380
But around that time, there was a lot of my friends were reaching out to serve where the name was greater abroad.

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:46.380
So that was something I didn't always became a good goal for me as well.

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.380
To expand my ministry.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:51.380
So one day a friend invited me.

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:52.380
She sent me a message.

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:55.380
She said, there's a chance for us to go to Honduras together.

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:59.380
It's a small island called Guanaha in the middle of the Caribbean.

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.380
It's like, why not?

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.380
It doesn't sound like something you should turn down.

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:05.380
But at the time, I had no money.

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:07.380
I had nothing in the bank.

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:10.380
I was filling my car up with two dollars for a petrol at a time.

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.380
I'm not going very far.

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:16.380
And just at that time, within the half hour of her message,

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:21.380
my work offered me a full-time position for a couple of months.

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:22.380
So I said, yes.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:25.380
So Jehovah gave me a way to go to Honduras.

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:28.380
So I went after three months of working,

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:32.380
and I arrived in a very small little island in the middle of the Caribbean,

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:34.380
and a special pioneer.

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:36.380
Who had red hair picked me up in a boat?

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:38.380
And that's what I'm saying.

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.380
We were married within the year.

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:46.380
You said, Judah, that it became home for you.

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:51.380
Is there anything specific about Honduras or Central America,

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:54.380
Mexico that made it feel like home?

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:57.380
Like Fernando said, the people.

00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:01.380
And when my family arrived to Honduras, we saw it right away.

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:04.380
Like I mentioned, we drove to Honduras.

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:08.380
So seven days, a family of five sitting together,

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.380
you can imagine what that journey would have been like.

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:14.380
But arriving in the country, you arrived in the middle of a hurricane,

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.380
which we didn't know when we left Canada.

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:21.380
So day seven coming into Honduras, hurricane Mitch, we caught,

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:25.380
and we were driving through the country in the pouring rain,

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:29.380
and got to a little town where we got stuck.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:31.380
There was no going forward.

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:32.380
The road was blocked by water.

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:33.380
We went back.

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.380
They could close the bridge already.

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.380
So I couldn't speak the language.

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:40.380
I was stuck in a little town.

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:45.380
So dad just rolled the window down and said all he could in Spanish.

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:49.380
Testigos de Heo va, something like that in this broken Spanish.

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:50.380
Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:53.380
He spoke better Spanish after that.

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:56.380
And sure enough, the man who was there pointed.

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.380
There was a sister just there, one of the, I think,

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:00.380
seven publishers in that town at the time.

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:02.380
So they took us in.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:05.380
They were in the middle of a hurricane suffering.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:08.380
And they were happy to have us.

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:11.380
It was, they were feeding us fried chicken.

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.380
One of the sisters had a little restaurant there.

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:15.380
We were excited about that.

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.380
So for a few days, we were stuck in this town.

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.380
But what a welcome we got in their homes.

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.380
And that's how it was everywhere we went.

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:23.380
Just into people's homes.

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:24.380
They loved to have us.

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.380
It was such a warm family.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.380
Warm welcome and hospitality.

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:31.380
How would you describe the hospitality, Carla?

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:34.380
Yeah, I would say that straightaway you're in.

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:36.380
You're in with them.

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:38.380
What do you mean by that?

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:41.380
As in, there's no breaking the ice phase.

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:43.380
There's no warming up to you phase.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:45.380
It's like straightaway as soon as you arrive in the congregation,

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:46.380
you're in with them.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:50.380
So you're passing by their house, for example,

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:53.380
and you're thirsty, you're hot.

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:54.380
They invite you in.

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.380
They sit you in front of a fan.

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:57.380
They give you water.

00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:58.380
You need an app.

00:25:58.380 --> 00:25:59.380
They have a bed.

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.380
They have a hammock.

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:01.380
If you want a porch.

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:05.380
So their hospitality is never just on their terms.

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:08.380
It's to meet the needs that you have.

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.380
So whatever need you had at that time,

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:12.380
they were just willing to fill it.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:13.380
Nice.

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:16.380
They came pick up you in the airport to feed it.

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:17.380
This is very nice.

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:18.380
I learned it quickly.

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:26.380
Judith, for you, as a young single, special pioneer,

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:29.380
did you enjoy the hospitality?

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:33.380
I did, and I have to say that it was kind of embarrassing.

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:35.380
The hospitality I was shown so much

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:38.380
so that I pretty much never cooked.

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.380
He still doesn't.

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:44.380
And that's why I never got to learn how to cook.

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:47.380
There were just two hospital assignments that I was in.

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:50.380
Thank you, brothers and sisters.

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.380
Very, very nice.

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:55.380
That just makes it home, going to a distant land

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.380
and to be so warmly welcomed.

00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:59.380
In fact, there was an expression they would use

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:00.380
when they would invite me over.

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:01.380
They would say, just come on in.

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:03.380
We'll add more water to the soup.

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:05.380
So that was the expression about what they were eating.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:07.380
It was a figurative expression, but it was beautiful.

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.380
Do you have an expression like that in Portuguese?

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:10.380
Yes.

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:12.380
We add water to the beans.

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:13.380
The same idea.

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:14.380
The same idea.

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:15.380
Yes.

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:16.380
Nice.

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:17.380
What about the ministry, though?

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:21.380
What does it like to preach in the areas where you've served?

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.380
In Central America and in Honduras,

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:26.380
where we were just such a respect for the Bible.

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:29.380
So, so easy to start conversations.

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:32.380
And that meant getting to know our Bibles.

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.380
I remember when we got there,

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:36.380
I'd not use the Bible much in the ministry.

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:37.380
Maybe a verse I'd memorize.

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:40.380
But then I'd be going in service with families

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.380
that had kids, maybe 10 years old,

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:45.380
that knew all these scriptures, different ones they were reading.

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:48.380
And I'm like, how do they know so many verses in the Bible?

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:50.380
But then just going more in service,

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:53.380
I realized it's because everybody wants to hear the Bible.

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.380
So that was really nice getting to know the scriptures.

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:58.380
What about for you, Carla?

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:00.380
So coming from Ireland to Honduras,

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:02.380
was there much of a learning curve for you?

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:03.380
Yeah.

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:05.380
The same was Judah just getting to know your Bible.

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:08.380
So maybe you're used to using just one or two scriptures at a door.

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:10.380
You had your favorites.

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:13.380
But there you could just like use the whole range of the Bible.

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:16.380
So that was really nice getting to know the Bible better.

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:18.380
Also getting to know the publications,

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:20.380
because there's so many opportunities to conduct Bible studies.

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.380
So you really got familiar with them.

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.380
And the publications.

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:27.380
And also something I really appreciated was,

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.380
you'd arrive at their house.

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:31.380
They weren't expecting you, but they sat you down.

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:33.380
They got their Bible out.

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:36.380
And as you were speaking, they would take notes and lines.

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:39.380
So seeing their appreciation for the Bible really helped

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.380
kind of like cement it down for you as well,

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.380
just how amazing the Bible is.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:47.380
Oh, what a beautiful experience. So nice.

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:49.380
The branch in Central America,

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:51.380
along with the AVS,

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:55.380
has prepared a nice video for us to be able to see some of these areas

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.380
and perhaps some of this hospitality

00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.380
and looking forward to seeing it with you.

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:05.690
Me too.

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:08.690
Central America is a large region of land

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:11.690
that includes the countries of Panama,

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:13.690
Costa Rica,

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:15.690
Nicaragua,

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:17.690
Honduras,

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:19.690
El Salvador,

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:21.690
Guatemala,

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:23.690
and Belize.

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:27.690
It extends in an arc roughly 1800 kilometers

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:31.690
or 1,100 miles in length from the northwest to the southeast.

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:34.690
And no matter where you live in Central America,

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:36.690
you are never more than 200 kilometers

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:40.690
or 125 miles away from the sea.

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:42.690
By September 2012,

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:44.690
the preaching work in Costa Rica,

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:45.690
El Salvador, Guatemala,

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:46.690
Honduras,

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:49.690
Nicaragua, and Panama all came under the supervision

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:52.690
of the Central America branch in Mexico.

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:55.690
What efforts are being made to reach honest hearted ones

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:59.690
in some of the diverse areas of Central America?

00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:04.690
It has truly been a beautiful experience to be here in El Salvador.

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:09.690
The training that we received at the School for Kingdom Evangelizers

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:11.690
has been so helpful

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:14.690
because it taught us that beyond delivering a message,

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:16.690
it is important to have empathy

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:19.690
and really listen and understand people.

00:30:24.339 --> 00:30:27.339
Well, people here are quite religious and devoted to their faith.

00:30:27.339 --> 00:30:30.339
I try to demonstrate Christian qualities,

00:30:30.339 --> 00:30:37.119
like those we're learning in the love people make disciples brochure.

00:30:37.119 --> 00:30:41.119
Today, we observe people and listen to what they want to express.

00:30:41.119 --> 00:30:44.119
We wait for the right moment to preach to them.

00:30:44.119 --> 00:30:47.119
That indicates that Jehovah is blessing the efforts

00:30:47.119 --> 00:30:50.119
we make to find the deserving ones.

00:30:50.119 --> 00:30:52.119
Here in La Seiva,

00:30:52.119 --> 00:30:54.119
we preach in different languages,

00:30:54.119 --> 00:30:56.119
called sign language,

00:30:56.119 --> 00:31:00.660
misquito, garifuna, and Spanish.

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:04.660
Jehovah has really blessed the efforts of the publishers here.

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:09.660
The local people are amazed when one greets them in their language.

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:12.660
And that is something that has been very positive.

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:21.579
We also have the use of JW.org

00:31:21.579 --> 00:31:26.579
and their face is shine when they are shown a video in their language.

00:31:27.579 --> 00:31:29.579
They are completely amazed and very happy

00:31:29.579 --> 00:31:32.579
that we have made videos in their language.

00:31:32.579 --> 00:31:38.109
We have seen Jehovah's blessing in the territory

00:31:38.109 --> 00:31:41.109
and also the support from our brothers.

00:31:41.109 --> 00:31:44.109
Feeling like we have many partners to preach with

00:31:44.109 --> 00:31:49.109
to make return visits and conduct Bible studies.

00:31:49.109 --> 00:31:53.109
This makes the ministry even more enjoyable.

00:31:53.109 --> 00:31:56.109
Mexico City is one of the largest cities in the world.

00:31:56.109 --> 00:32:01.109
The main city has a population of over 9 million.

00:32:01.109 --> 00:32:03.109
Many languages are spoken,

00:32:03.109 --> 00:32:08.109
not just the main languages like English, Spanish, French,

00:32:08.109 --> 00:32:11.109
but also indigenous languages.

00:32:11.109 --> 00:32:13.109
The number of languages present a big challenge

00:32:13.109 --> 00:32:16.109
because how do we reach all those people?

00:32:16.109 --> 00:32:21.109
Well, one thing that has really helped is public witnessing.

00:32:21.109 --> 00:32:23.109
We have, for example,

00:32:23.109 --> 00:32:28.109
over 24 locations for special metropolitan witnessing

00:32:28.109 --> 00:32:29.109
just in Mexico City.

00:32:29.109 --> 00:32:32.109
So that opens up a big opportunity to reach people

00:32:32.109 --> 00:32:34.109
in their native language.

00:32:34.109 --> 00:32:38.109
So recently two groups were formed in Haitian Creole.

00:32:38.109 --> 00:32:41.109
It's beautiful to welcome people who speak another language

00:32:41.109 --> 00:32:44.109
and be able to learn it to transmit Jehovah's message

00:32:44.109 --> 00:32:47.109
in that language.

00:32:47.109 --> 00:32:52.109
As you can see, Central America's diversity is also its beauty.

00:32:53.109 --> 00:32:57.109
Jehovah's people are reflecting like mirrors his great love

00:32:57.109 --> 00:33:02.109
in reaching out to people of all nationalities, tongues, and backgrounds.

00:33:02.109 --> 00:33:09.640
Remarkable.

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:10.640
Thank you so much for that.

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:14.640
It's amazing to see the work that's just the variety of places

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.640
and the work that's being done there.

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:19.640
I notice there's a lot of water, a lot of water, a lot of beaches.

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.640
Do you swim there?

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.640
Yes, on the island where we were,

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:26.640
pretty much every week we would spend a nice day at the beach

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.640
enjoying the water, snorkeling.

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.640
Crystal clear, beautiful.

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.640
Miss it.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.640
Crystal clear, a lot of water in the Amazon region.

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:36.640
Do you swim there?

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.640
Yes.

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:42.640
But it's not crystal and clear all the time.

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:45.640
And sometimes we have crocodiles.

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:47.640
And pinangas, it's...

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:50.640
We need to look.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.640
Yeah, what is possible to do that?

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:57.640
But again, Jude and Krath, just a beautiful spirit.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.640
We see the brothers and sisters there in the hard work.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:00.640
Thank you very much.

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:04.640
Thank you for letting us talk to you about the amazing preaching work

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.640
there in Central America.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:07.640
Thank you.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.639
Let's meet our next guests.

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:13.639
It's Christian and Karina Zagetti from the Philippines.

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:31.250
Christian and Karina, welcome.

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:35.250
Thank you for being here with us on the Inside Story.

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:38.250
So you both are serving in Philippines at the Philippines branch,

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:41.250
but you're not from the Philippines, you're from Brazil.

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:46.250
So how did you get from Brazil to the Philippines?

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:47.250
That's a good question.

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:50.250
I'm asking myself how I ended up there.

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:56.250
So now, actually, we got transferred from Brazil branch

00:34:56.250 --> 00:35:00.250
to the Philippines branch for a project for a computer department,

00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:02.250
initially for two years.

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:04.250
Initially, it's a long project.

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:06.250
Yes.

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:09.250
We've been there for almost 15 years now.

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:10.250
Well, that's beautiful, though.

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:11.250
But how did it happen?

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:15.250
What was it that happened that got you to the Philippines?

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:19.250
Yes, so we got an invitation.

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:23.250
There were possibilities for us to serve in another branch.

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:28.250
So I was serving as a single in Brazil for 12 years.

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:30.250
Then we got married.

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:31.250
I was there.

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:32.250
Fernando was there.

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:33.250
Fernando was there.

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:36.250
Yeah, he was in our wedding.

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:38.250
We got approved to stay in Bethel.

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:41.250
And then just a few months after we got married,

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:44.250
we had this possibility to serve in another branch.

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:48.250
But we consider, talk about it, pray about it, maybe,

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:49.250
maybe another time.

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:51.250
New in Bethel.

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:54.250
But you ended up in the Philippines.

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:59.250
That just three months later, this next opportunity came.

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:01.250
New invitation to go to the Philippines.

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:07.250
So we realized you're over one in us to go to a foreign assignment.

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:11.250
And we prayed about it and say, yes, we didn't want to be like,

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:12.250
join and say no.

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:14.250
So we're like, let's go.

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:16.250
Well, Jonah was a courageous prophet.

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:17.250
That's true.

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:18.250
And you're courageous.

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:19.250
Jonah went to his assignment.

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:22.250
And here you are in the Philippines.

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:30.250
So a long way from home, what would you say that helped make the Philippines your home?

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:33.250
And definitely the brotherhood.

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:36.250
Jehovah's organization, it's truly a big family.

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:42.250
And being so far from home, we can feel the love from the brothers in the congregation

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:44.250
and in the Bethel family.

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:46.250
How they welcomed us.

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:49.250
Always so concerned for our well-being.

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:53.250
And also, they went always out of their way to care for us.

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:55.250
So it was beautiful to see.

00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:58.250
And that definitely made us feel home pretty quickly.

00:36:58.250 --> 00:36:59.250
I'm sure it would.

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:03.250
Can you think of an example, Christian, of how they did that for you?

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:07.250
Well, the brothers, they did so many things for us to feel at home.

00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:14.250
So I think one thing that touched our hearts was when we were still having the food arrangement in Bethel.

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:18.250
So we had to go down to the dining hall to have breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:23.250
So we had this single brother in our table, in Bethel table, in the dining hall.

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:29.250
And he was from one of the distant provinces in the country.

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:35.250
And we were having a little bit of hard time to have fish and rice for breakfast.

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:38.250
So we were still trying to have fish and rice.

00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:40.250
Yes, big eyes.

00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:44.250
With big eyes, with the tail, the whole fish there.

00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:47.250
But this brother, I think he was concerned about us.

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:49.250
And he said, hey, what is your favorite food?

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:51.250
I didn't have anything to say at the moment.

00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:54.250
And I just thought about maybe a hamburger with fries.

00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:56.250
I think that's my favorite food, I guess.

00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:59.250
So instead of fish and rice for breakfast, hamburger and fries for breakfast.

00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:03.250
I would say for lunch and dinner.

00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:08.250
But then the next following day, right in front of our Bethel room,

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:12.250
there was a package there, and the brother gave it to us.

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:15.250
And he was like, concerned about our well-being.

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:16.250
So it was amazing.

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:20.250
It was just a little thing, but among so many others that the brothers made for us.

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:22.250
For us to feel at home, yeah.

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:24.250
So in the package was a hamburger and fries.

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:25.250
A hamburger.

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:27.250
Amazing, happy.

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:28.250
That's true.

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:30.250
Well, it would make you feel at home.

00:38:30.250 --> 00:38:31.250
Yeah.

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:32.250
That's absolutely beautiful.

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:34.250
And so you're serving at the branch.

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:36.250
The branches in Manila.

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:39.250
Manila is one of the most densely populated cities in the world.

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:42.250
So what is preaching like in the city of Manila?

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:43.250
Yeah, that's true.

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:46.250
It's one of the most densely populated cities in the world.

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:48.250
There's a lot of people everywhere.

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:51.250
But the good thing is that they're really...

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:56.250
It's not hard to talk to people about the truth or about the Bible, especially the Bible.

00:38:56.250 --> 00:38:59.250
Like Judamation and Fernandomation about these regions.

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:02.250
So they have a real respect for the Bible.

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:07.250
So we have all these arrangements in place, like street witnessing,

00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:10.250
metropolitan witnessing,

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:12.250
cart witnessing.

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:15.250
We have a variety of business territories to covert.

00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:17.250
And we also have more witnessing.

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:18.250
More witnessing.

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:21.250
More witnessing is an interesting form of preaching.

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:25.250
It's hard to not get distracted by the stores.

00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:29.250
And I love the coffee shops there, so I had a...

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:30.250
But it's interesting.

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:33.250
You can still meet and talk to people in these areas.

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:38.250
And they are fine if you approach them in the right moment, the right time.

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:39.250
You mean in the coffee shop?

00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:40.250
In the coffee shop.

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:41.250
You can be in the coffee shop.

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:43.250
Now I see my Christian loves coffee so much.

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:44.250
Yeah.

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:51.250
I would like to try to find a shopping mall in the middle of the Amazon rainforest.

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:53.250
With the coffee shop.

00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:54.250
With the coffee shop.

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:56.250
Yeah, it would be nice.

00:39:56.250 --> 00:40:01.250
Again, the branch in the Philippines and ABS have prepared a video.

00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:04.250
We're looking forward to seeing what preaching is like in the Philippines,

00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:08.250
particularly in the metropolitan mill area.

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:09.250
So let's look at it.

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:15.489
The Philippines is an island country of Southeast Asia.

00:40:15.489 --> 00:40:19.489
Located in a Pacific Ocean.

00:40:19.489 --> 00:40:24.489
It consists of more than 7,000 islands and eyelids,

00:40:24.489 --> 00:40:30.489
about 800 kilometers or 500 miles off the coast of Vietnam.

00:40:30.489 --> 00:40:35.489
Did you know that Philippines is the second most popular Asian country

00:40:35.489 --> 00:40:39.489
with English as an official language following India?

00:40:39.489 --> 00:40:44.489
The capital, Manila, is part of a greater metropolitan region known

00:40:44.489 --> 00:40:47.489
as metropolitan Manila.

00:40:47.489 --> 00:40:51.489
Interestingly, well, this is the smallest region in the Philippines.

00:40:51.489 --> 00:40:54.489
It is also the most densely populated,

00:40:54.489 --> 00:40:59.489
being home to over 13 million Filipinos.

00:40:59.489 --> 00:41:04.489
What is it like to preach in this densely populated area?

00:41:04.489 --> 00:41:10.489
More than 10% of the publishers in the Philippines reside in Metro Manila.

00:41:10.489 --> 00:41:13.489
That is over 30,000 publishers.

00:41:13.489 --> 00:41:19.489
Interestingly, over 9,400 of them serve as regular pioneers.

00:41:19.489 --> 00:41:22.489
Metro Manila is a city of contrast.

00:41:22.489 --> 00:41:26.489
It has high buildings in its central business districts.

00:41:26.489 --> 00:41:31.489
It also has informal settlements in narrow streets and alleyways.

00:41:31.489 --> 00:41:37.489
A street of less than a kilometer can be home to hundreds of families.

00:41:37.489 --> 00:41:39.489
Some congregations in our circuit,

00:41:39.489 --> 00:41:42.489
especially those that are in the metropolitan area,

00:41:42.489 --> 00:41:45.489
are assigned to work on many apartment buildings.

00:41:45.489 --> 00:41:49.489
So the congregation body of elders have trained specific individuals

00:41:49.489 --> 00:41:55.409
to be able to penetrate these areas effectively.

00:41:55.409 --> 00:41:58.409
Some areas in Metro Manila are so densely populated,

00:41:58.409 --> 00:42:03.409
we don't always have accurate maps or specific addresses for everyone.

00:42:03.409 --> 00:42:08.409
So it can be a real challenge to determine whether these areas

00:42:08.409 --> 00:42:11.409
have been well covered or not.

00:42:12.409 --> 00:42:17.409
But thanks to good telecratic training and useful online tools,

00:42:17.409 --> 00:42:20.409
these areas are getting mapped out.

00:42:20.409 --> 00:42:25.409
The Filipino Sign Language Territory is an interesting field in Metro Manila.

00:42:25.409 --> 00:42:28.409
Many brothers and sisters have learned the Sign Language

00:42:28.409 --> 00:42:33.409
in order to help the deaf ones learn the good news.

00:42:33.409 --> 00:42:39.409
We can see Jehovah's Blessing through the fulfilment of Haggai chapter 2 verse 7.

00:42:40.409 --> 00:42:44.409
It feels as though Jehovah is indeed shaking these territories

00:42:44.409 --> 00:42:46.409
so that the precious ones,

00:42:46.409 --> 00:42:48.409
those rightly disposed hearts,

00:42:48.409 --> 00:42:51.409
will come to his organization and serve him.

00:42:51.409 --> 00:42:54.409
Personally, it's very encouraging to see

00:42:54.409 --> 00:42:59.409
how the brothers and sisters endure faithfully and joyfully.

00:42:59.409 --> 00:43:03.409
They endure not because they do not have a choice.

00:43:03.409 --> 00:43:05.409
They endure because they are happy,

00:43:05.409 --> 00:43:10.409
doing God's work and loving the people.

00:43:10.409 --> 00:43:15.409
Yes, as you can see, the Philippines is a preaching paradise.

00:43:15.409 --> 00:43:34.659
Jehovah is making sure that no one gets mis in this historic time of the end.

00:43:34.659 --> 00:43:38.659
Wow, there is so much being done and so much work to do.

00:43:38.659 --> 00:43:40.659
Let me ask you this though,

00:43:40.659 --> 00:43:43.659
the brother mentioned there are so many publishers in the Metro Manila era

00:43:44.659 --> 00:43:46.659
and a lot of regular pioneers,

00:43:46.659 --> 00:43:49.659
even with so many publishers there,

00:43:49.659 --> 00:43:52.659
is there still a need?

00:43:52.659 --> 00:43:54.659
Yes, there is still a need.

00:43:54.659 --> 00:43:57.659
It's actually one of the regions in the country

00:43:57.659 --> 00:44:00.659
that there is a growth in publishers.

00:44:00.659 --> 00:44:06.659
As a matter of fact, nearly 20% of those who were baptized

00:44:06.659 --> 00:44:10.659
in the Philippines were coming from this particular area in Manila.

00:44:10.659 --> 00:44:14.659
So in Manila region, so there is growth there for sure.

00:44:14.659 --> 00:44:16.659
Wow, interesting. Thank you so much.

00:44:16.659 --> 00:44:18.659
Christian Karina, thank you so much for being here

00:44:18.659 --> 00:44:20.659
and thank you for your self-sacrificing spirit

00:44:20.659 --> 00:44:22.659
in being in the Philippines,

00:44:22.659 --> 00:44:25.659
making it your home and supporting the work that's going on there.

00:44:25.659 --> 00:44:29.659
And we say thank you to all of you for being with us on the inside story

00:44:29.659 --> 00:44:34.659
and your self-sacrificing spirit to support the preaching work.

00:44:34.659 --> 00:44:36.659
Jesus said the fields are white for harvesting

00:44:36.659 --> 00:44:39.659
and what we've seen today indeed they are.

00:44:39.659 --> 00:44:42.659
And it's beautiful to see the spirit, the intrepid spirit

00:44:42.659 --> 00:44:46.659
of our brothers and sisters in preaching the good news of God's kingdom

00:44:46.659 --> 00:44:51.659
and also to see the support of the School for Kingdom Evangelizers

00:44:51.659 --> 00:44:55.659
to help this work grow worldwide.

00:44:55.659 --> 00:44:59.659
We look forward to seeing all of you on another edition of the Inside Story.

00:44:59.659 --> 00:45:33.500
Well, the time has now come for the principal talk of this graduation.

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:37.500
It will be presented by a member of the governing body, Brother Mark Sanderson,

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:39.500
and he has chosen the theme.

00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:45.500
The desirable thing in a man is let's give him our attention.

00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:49.500
It is as high as the heavens.

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:52.500
It fills the earth.

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:57.500
It is extended to a thousand generations

00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:00.500
and it endures forever.

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:02.500
What is it?

00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:10.500
It is one of Jehovah's most beautiful qualities, his loyal love.

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:14.500
Now what is loyal love?

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:17.500
Well, one of our publications says this.

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:23.500
Loyal love defies a concise definition in many languages

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:26.500
and I'd like to say English is one of them.

00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:31.500
Trying to find a concise definition is not easy

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:34.500
but I'll take a stab at it.

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:39.500
The glossary of Bible terms in the New World translation says this.

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:46.500
Loyal love refers to love motivated by commitment, integrity,

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:50.500
loyalty, and deep attachment.

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:52.500
Another reference says this.

00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:58.500
It is kindness that lovingly attaches itself to persons

00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:04.500
and being evident in continual kind actions.

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:06.500
Did you get that?

00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:12.500
Becoming evident in continual kind actions.

00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:16.500
But perhaps the best reference that I found

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.500
was the one that said this.

00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:23.500
The best way to grasp the essence of the biblical expression

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:29.500
is by studying how God treated his true worshipers down through the ages.

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:31.500
Isn't that true?

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:35.500
When we think about how Jehovah protected and fed the Israelites

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:38.500
when they were in the wilderness for 40 years,

00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:40.500
when he brought them into the promised land,

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:44.500
he gave them judges to rescue them from their enemies.

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:48.500
He gave them prophets to rescue them and bring them back

00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:51.500
when they got involved in false worship.

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:56.500
And because Jehovah stuck with them in good times

00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:00.500
and in the very most difficult of times,

00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:02.500
Jehovah could say this to the nation.

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:03.500
Let's read it.

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:09.500
Jeremiah chapter 31 and verse 3.

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:12.500
About midway down the verse, Jehovah says,

00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:18.500
I have loved you with an everlasting love.

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:24.500
That is why I have drawn you to me with loyal love.

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:26.500
Well, that is so true.

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:32.500
We are drawn to Jehovah because of his loyal love for us.

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:34.500
We can trust it.

00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:36.500
We can rely on it.

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:41.500
In good times and in the very most difficult of times in our lives,

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:47.500
we are always living in expectation of Jehovah's loyal love

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:54.500
that he manifests in his continual kind act toward each of us.

00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:59.500
Brothers, don't we love Jehovah's loyal love?

00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:07.889
Well, while we can never equal Jehovah in showing loyal love,

00:49:07.889 --> 00:49:12.889
the scriptures do show that this is a quality that we as humans

00:49:12.889 --> 00:49:16.889
must display toward others.

00:49:16.889 --> 00:49:21.889
Now let's read together what it says in Proverbs chapter 3.

00:49:21.889 --> 00:49:25.889
Proverbs chapter 3 and verse 3.

00:49:25.889 --> 00:49:32.889
It says, Do not let loyal love and faithfulness leave you.

00:49:32.889 --> 00:49:34.889
Tie them around your neck.

00:49:34.889 --> 00:49:38.889
Write them on the tablet of your heart.

00:49:38.889 --> 00:49:41.889
So what do you learn from that?

00:49:41.889 --> 00:49:46.889
We are expected by Jehovah to display loyal love.

00:49:46.889 --> 00:49:52.889
But how do we as humans display loyal love to other people?

00:49:52.889 --> 00:49:58.889
Well, just as Jehovah's loyal love causes him to attach himself to us

00:49:58.889 --> 00:50:02.889
with commitment and loyalty,

00:50:02.889 --> 00:50:06.889
well, we want to attach ourselves, others to others,

00:50:06.889 --> 00:50:12.889
not simply with warm and fuzzy feelings,

00:50:12.889 --> 00:50:20.889
but with continual, enduring, steadfast acts of kindness

00:50:20.889 --> 00:50:23.889
that demonstrate our loyal love.

00:50:23.889 --> 00:50:29.889
Now why is this an important topic for all of you who are graduating today?

00:50:29.889 --> 00:50:31.889
Well, let's consider three reasons.

00:50:31.889 --> 00:50:33.889
Here's the first.

00:50:33.889 --> 00:50:39.889
You have all been recipients of loyal love from others.

00:50:39.889 --> 00:50:42.889
Now how did you get here to Gilead?

00:50:42.889 --> 00:50:46.889
Now I don't mean how did you get here to the auditorium this morning.

00:50:46.889 --> 00:50:51.889
But how is it that you got to this point in your life

00:50:51.889 --> 00:50:55.889
that today you are graduating from the Gilead school?

00:50:55.889 --> 00:51:01.889
It's good for all of you to pause now and reflect on that question.

00:51:01.889 --> 00:51:05.889
Who were the people that loved you?

00:51:05.889 --> 00:51:11.889
Who were the people that helped you so that you could be here today, graduated?

00:51:11.889 --> 00:51:17.889
Who stood by you in good times and in bad times?

00:51:17.889 --> 00:51:21.889
Maybe some of you think of your dear parents,

00:51:21.889 --> 00:51:25.889
some of whom might be here today in the audience.

00:51:25.889 --> 00:51:29.889
If you are, this is a happy day, right? I don't need to ask.

00:51:30.889 --> 00:51:34.889
Maybe it was the brother or sister who studied the Bible with you.

00:51:34.889 --> 00:51:39.889
Maybe it was the circuit overseer who encouraged you when you were young

00:51:39.889 --> 00:51:44.889
or that older sister in the congregation that believed in you

00:51:44.889 --> 00:51:49.889
and encouraged you to pioneer or to put in your application for Bethel.

00:51:49.889 --> 00:51:57.889
Well today is a day for you to look through the photo album of your heart

00:51:58.889 --> 00:52:03.889
and consider all of the people that have shown loyal love to you

00:52:03.889 --> 00:52:07.889
and have encouraged you all along the way.

00:52:07.889 --> 00:52:13.889
And then to be like Jehovah and show loyal love to them.

00:52:13.889 --> 00:52:19.889
Maybe write them a card, send them a letter or an email,

00:52:19.889 --> 00:52:23.889
maybe a text message or a gift.

00:52:23.889 --> 00:52:32.889
You see some kind act to maintain that bond of loyal love between you.

00:52:32.889 --> 00:52:35.889
And how are you benefited by doing so?

00:52:35.889 --> 00:52:42.889
Well, among other things, it helps to keep you humble and modest,

00:52:42.889 --> 00:52:46.889
always remembering that the things that you have achieved thus far

00:52:46.889 --> 00:52:53.889
whatever you may achieve in the future is not solely due to your efforts

00:52:53.889 --> 00:52:59.889
but in large part due to the loyal love that you have experienced from Jehovah

00:52:59.889 --> 00:53:04.889
and from so many other loyal friends.

00:53:04.889 --> 00:53:10.889
And never underestimate the power of a simple act of loyal love.

00:53:10.889 --> 00:53:15.889
You know, one day I suddenly began to think about a couple

00:53:15.889 --> 00:53:20.889
that helped us so much during the court cases in Moscow.

00:53:20.889 --> 00:53:24.889
I decided them to just send them a brief text message

00:53:24.889 --> 00:53:29.889
just to see how they were doing to check on them, let them know I was thinking about them.

00:53:29.889 --> 00:53:33.889
And just a few minutes later, a text came back.

00:53:33.889 --> 00:53:38.889
Brother Mark, we can't believe you wrote to us right now.

00:53:38.889 --> 00:53:44.889
We were both on our knees praying to Jehovah, begging him

00:53:44.889 --> 00:53:53.889
for some encouragement when suddenly we heard Ding on our phone.

00:53:53.889 --> 00:54:00.889
Prove yourselves to be like your Heavenly Father by demonstrating loyal love

00:54:00.889 --> 00:54:05.889
to all of the people that have loved you and who have helped you

00:54:05.889 --> 00:54:12.260
to be sitting in these front rows of this auditorium today.

00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:14.260
Here's a second.

00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:18.260
In your assignments, you brothers who are graduating

00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:22.260
are going to serve in one sense or another as overseers.

00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:27.260
Now, always demonstrate loyal love to the brothers and sisters

00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:30.260
that you're going to oversee and care for.

00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:34.260
Now, that sounds like a very obvious statement, doesn't it?

00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:38.260
And yet for us as humans, it can be challenging.

00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:41.260
Well, why so?

00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:44.260
Well, as we've discussed, when it comes to humans,

00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:49.260
loyal love involves a bond between two people

00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:54.260
and the continual kind deeds that occur between them

00:54:54.260 --> 00:54:57.260
that create this lasting bond.

00:54:57.260 --> 00:54:59.260
But now, here's the challenge.

00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:05.260
You see, as imperfect humans, we may be very quick to form a bond

00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:08.260
with people that we feel a connection with.

00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:13.260
People who have similar abilities, similar talents, similar interests.

00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:17.260
If you work in the service department, you're drawn to the circuit overseers,

00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:23.860
the missionaries, the special pioneers, the desksmen, they're all wonderful.

00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:27.860
If you're a translator, oh, you love the translators.

00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:30.860
That brother helped translate the Bible.

00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:32.860
My, right?

00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:36.860
So you just love them, can't get enough of them.

00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:43.239
If you work in the legal department, you even love the lawyers.

00:55:43.239 --> 00:55:45.239
Oh, sorry, we all love the lawyers.

00:55:45.239 --> 00:55:47.239
Sorry, we love you all.

00:55:47.239 --> 00:55:51.869
And so on, and so on.

00:55:51.869 --> 00:55:56.869
You see, we all love those wonderful, capable people

00:55:56.869 --> 00:55:59.869
that we easily admire and look up to.

00:55:59.869 --> 00:56:02.869
But here's a question.

00:56:02.869 --> 00:56:04.869
What about all the faithful people?

00:56:04.869 --> 00:56:07.869
What about all the faithful servants of Jehovah

00:56:07.869 --> 00:56:10.869
that we just don't have that immediate connection with?

00:56:10.869 --> 00:56:13.869
Let me be far more clear.

00:56:13.869 --> 00:56:20.820
What about all the faithful people that are just plain annoying?

00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:28.269
You know who you are.

00:56:28.269 --> 00:56:30.269
People who won't take your phone calls.

00:56:30.269 --> 00:56:42.920
Well, what are we going to do with all of those people?

00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:48.920
Well, we have an answer because just to be quite frank with you,

00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:51.920
the Bible is filled with annoying people.

00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:56.360
Now, we all love Abraham, right?

00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:58.360
We all love Abraham.

00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:00.360
But now, if you go to Genesis chapter 18,

00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:02.360
we're not going to read all of this,

00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:07.360
but I'm just going to remind you of this account that you know well, Genesis 18.

00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:10.360
And you know, we go down here,

00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:15.360
and we hear Abraham praying to Jehovah, begins about verse 24,

00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:19.360
and Abraham begins to go into this thing with Jehovah.

00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:21.360
Jehovah, what if there's 50?

00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:23.360
See, what if there's 45?

00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:25.360
What if there's 40?

00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:26.360
What if there's 30?

00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:28.360
What if there's 20?

00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:30.360
What if there's 10?

00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:32.360
That's annoying.

00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:36.150
It's just annoying, sorry.

00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:43.150
But now, what did Jehovah do with that man who is a bit annoying?

00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:45.150
He loved him.

00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:47.150
He loved him.

00:57:47.150 --> 00:57:49.150
He loyally stuck by him.

00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:54.150
And although Abraham had been dead for more than a thousand years,

00:57:54.150 --> 00:58:00.150
he continued to call him Abraham, my friend.

00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:04.150
That's real loyal love.

00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:06.150
What about Peter?

00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:09.150
Peter could be very annoying.

00:58:09.150 --> 00:58:11.150
Now, think about just one occasion.

00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:14.150
Matthew chapter 17.

00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:16.150
Matthew 17.

00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:19.150
Here is Jesus.

00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:22.150
And it's the occasion of the transfiguration.

00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:25.150
This is a miraculous event, right?

00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:31.150
So here, Peter is watching as Jesus is being transfigured,

00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:34.150
and he sees him speaking with Moses and Elijah.

00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:36.150
What an event, right?

00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:38.150
Wouldn't it be exciting to see this?

00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:40.150
This supernatural event?

00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:43.150
And what does Peter say?

00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:51.539
Hey, let's put up tents, and we can go camping.

00:58:51.539 --> 00:58:54.539
That is annoying.

00:58:54.539 --> 00:58:58.590
That is annoying.

00:58:58.590 --> 00:59:00.590
But it doesn't end there.

00:59:00.590 --> 00:59:05.869
Of course, Peter went on to deny Jesus three times.

00:59:05.869 --> 00:59:08.869
That's annoying.

00:59:08.869 --> 00:59:14.150
But what did Jesus do with that man who could be so annoying?

00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:18.150
He gave him the keys of the kingdom.

00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:22.150
He trusted him with great responsibility.

00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:28.150
He showed true loyal love to that annoying man.

00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:30.150
So what's the point?

00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:35.150
As you work as overseers, and you deal with your brothers and sisters,

00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:38.150
even the annoying ones.

00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:40.150
Remember the principle.

00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:43.150
The simple principle that Jesus stated at Luke chapter 6.

00:59:43.150 --> 00:59:45.150
Will you read it with me?

00:59:45.150 --> 00:59:47.150
Let's read it.

00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:49.150
Chapter 6, verse 32.

00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:52.150
If you love those loving you,

00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:54.150
of what credit is it to you,

00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:58.150
for even the sinners love those loving them,

00:59:58.150 --> 01:00:01.150
and if you do good to those doing good to you,

01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:04.150
of what credit is it to you,

01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:07.150
even the sinners do the same.

01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:10.150
So demonstrate loyal love,

01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:15.150
not just to those who you feel that immediate connection with,

01:00:15.150 --> 01:00:19.150
but to all the faithful ones that you will oversee and care for,

01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:23.150
work to form a bond of love,

01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:27.150
even with the annoying ones.

01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:29.150
And here's the third.

01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:33.150
People in your assignments need your loyal love.

01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:37.150
You see, the stated purpose of Gilead is to train men and women

01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:41.150
who can strengthen and stabilize God's people.

01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:43.150
Well, now who are those people?

01:00:43.150 --> 01:00:45.150
Who are they?

01:00:45.150 --> 01:00:49.150
They're simple, humble, faithful men and women

01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:54.150
who are just trying their best to serve Jehovah.

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:57.150
Some are widows, some are orphans,

01:00:57.150 --> 01:01:01.150
some are elderly, others are victims of natural disasters

01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:04.150
and calamities of every sort.

01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:07.150
Some are facing devastating diseases

01:01:07.150 --> 01:01:11.150
while others are imprisoned for their faith.

01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:19.150
All of these people need for you to loyally attach yourself to them,

01:01:19.150 --> 01:01:25.150
to reassure them of your love through your continual kind deeds.

01:01:25.150 --> 01:01:32.150
Well, to do so is going to require more than just warm feelings.

01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:34.150
It's going to take your time.

01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:38.150
It's going to take your emotional energy.

01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:44.150
But this is what Jehovah instructs us to do at Zechariah chapter 7 and verse 9.

01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:46.150
We read it with me.

01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:50.150
Zechariah chapter 7 and verse 9.

01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:51.150
It says,

01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:55.150
This is what Jehovah of armies says.

01:01:55.150 --> 01:01:58.150
Judge with true justice

01:01:58.150 --> 01:02:04.150
and deal with one another in loyal love and mercy.

01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:10.150
So Jehovah instructs us to deal with one another in loyal love.

01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:15.150
Showing loyal love for your brothers and sisters who are struggling,

01:02:15.150 --> 01:02:17.150
who are suffering,

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:23.150
will show that you really got the point of your Gilead training

01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:28.150
and that you are in your assignments to strengthen and to stabilize,

01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:33.150
to loyally love and support your brothers and sisters.

01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:40.150
Remember, remember, they need, they need your loyal love.

01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:43.150
Well, what have we learned in this discussion?

01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:49.150
Loyal love is one of the most beautiful qualities of our amazing God, Jehovah.

01:02:49.150 --> 01:02:56.150
But Jehovah also expects that we are going to display loyal love to one another,

01:02:56.150 --> 01:03:01.150
that we will go through the photo album of our heart

01:03:01.150 --> 01:03:06.150
and remember those who have displayed loyal love to us,

01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:10.150
that we will loyally love all of those under our oversight,

01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:14.150
even the annoying ones,

01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:20.150
and that we will reach out with loyal love to those who are suffering

01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:25.150
and who most need our kindness and attention.

01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:29.150
Well, if you work hard in these ways to display loyal love,

01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:34.150
what can all of you who are graduating today expect?

01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:40.150
We know that you will be deeply loved by our Heavenly Father, Jehovah,

01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:47.150
but also by all your brothers and sisters that you are going to serve.

01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:49.150
And how do we know this?

01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:56.150
Well, it's because of something the Bible says here in Proverbs 19 and verse 22.

01:03:57.150 --> 01:04:01.150
Proverbs 19 verse 22 says,

01:04:01.150 --> 01:04:08.150
the desirable thing in a man is his loyal love.

01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:14.150
So may the blessing of Jehovah go with all of you wherever you go,

01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:21.150
and may you never forget that the desirable thing in a man is his loyal love.

01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:31.269
So now the time has come for the presentation of the diplomas.

01:04:31.269 --> 01:04:34.269
Brother Michael Banks, a helper to the teaching committee,

01:04:34.269 --> 01:04:37.269
will assist me with the names and assignments.

Brother and Sister Stevenson have been assigned to the Brazil branch.

01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:48.980
Brother and Sister Stalk will return to the Central Europe branch.

Brother and Sister Ziegetti have been assigned to the Brazil branch.

But the Zoro will return to the Italy branch.

01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:34.229
Michael had the hard part.

01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:38.699
Well, would you like to see the entire class?

01:08:47.319 --> 01:08:49.319
Gilead class 157.

01:08:49.319 --> 01:08:52.319
We're happy that we don't have to say Jiger Sejadufa,

01:08:52.319 --> 01:08:55.319
as Brothers Plain mentioned in a previous graduation,

01:08:55.319 --> 01:08:58.319
which is the air make term for Gilead.

01:08:58.319 --> 01:09:01.319
But at this time, we'd like to have Brother Sebastian Stalk

01:09:01.319 --> 01:09:09.539
who will read a letter from the graduating class.

01:09:09.539 --> 01:09:11.539
To the governing body.

01:09:11.539 --> 01:09:15.539
Over the past five months, we have seen our grand instructor

01:09:15.539 --> 01:09:18.539
with our own eyes.

01:09:18.539 --> 01:09:20.539
We've learned through his word.

01:09:20.539 --> 01:09:24.539
And now our hearts are overflowing with love, gratitude,

01:09:24.539 --> 01:09:26.539
and trust in him.

01:09:26.539 --> 01:09:29.539
When we began our Gilead training,

01:09:29.539 --> 01:09:32.539
we often viewed scriptures as individual puzzle pieces

01:09:32.539 --> 01:09:35.539
elected and applied to certain situations.

01:09:35.539 --> 01:09:39.539
Now, we have experienced how these pieces come together

01:09:39.539 --> 01:09:44.539
to reveal a unified and complete mosaic of Bible truth.

01:09:44.539 --> 01:09:47.539
We thank you for the undiserved privilege

01:09:47.539 --> 01:09:52.539
to take deep into and immerse ourselves in God's word.

01:09:52.539 --> 01:09:56.539
We appreciate the time and energy that you shared with our class.

01:09:56.539 --> 01:09:59.539
We benefited not only from the lectures,

01:09:59.539 --> 01:10:03.539
but also the attention you dedicated to us afterwards.

01:10:03.539 --> 01:10:07.539
We've been strengthened and encouraged by your humility

01:10:07.539 --> 01:10:11.539
and how you have cultivated the mind of Christ.

01:10:11.539 --> 01:10:14.539
Your deep love and respect for Jerova's word motivates us

01:10:14.539 --> 01:10:18.539
to continue to build our own appreciation.

01:10:18.539 --> 01:10:23.539
Your self-sacrificing spirit encourages us to imitate your example.

01:10:23.539 --> 01:10:26.539
We are thankful that Jerova uses you as a means

01:10:26.539 --> 01:10:30.539
to instruct us about the good way in which we should walk.

01:10:30.539 --> 01:10:35.039
We are grateful to our instructors.

01:10:35.039 --> 01:10:39.039
They help us to peer into the perfect law of God's word,

01:10:39.039 --> 01:10:43.039
discern its principles, and make personal application.

01:10:44.039 --> 01:10:47.039
Enthusiasm for the Bible accounts brought them to life

01:10:47.039 --> 01:10:52.039
and helped get the words of the page and into our minds and hearts.

01:10:52.039 --> 01:10:56.039
That dedication to the art of teaching reinforced our desire

01:10:56.039 --> 01:10:59.039
to give our all each and every day so that we could fully benefit

01:10:59.039 --> 01:11:01.039
from the class.

01:11:01.039 --> 01:11:05.039
We want to express our gratitude to the entire

01:11:05.039 --> 01:11:08.039
Theocratic schools department for their tireless efforts

01:11:08.039 --> 01:11:12.039
behind the scenes to make our busy daily routine as smooth as possible.

01:11:13.039 --> 01:11:17.039
Additionally, we are grateful to the US special family

01:11:17.039 --> 01:11:21.039
for the hospitality and generosity.

01:11:21.039 --> 01:11:24.039
They have shown us in a practical way what it means to show love

01:11:24.039 --> 01:11:27.039
and kindness to strangers.

01:11:27.039 --> 01:11:31.039
Knowing that they demonstrate this love to every class

01:11:31.039 --> 01:11:36.039
year after year must certainly make our Heavenly Father smile.

01:11:36.039 --> 01:11:40.420
Your beautiful example touched our hearts.

01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:43.420
As we depart for our assignments,

01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:46.420
we have in mind David's words,

01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:50.420
be courageous and strong and go to work.

01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:54.420
Do not be afraid or be terrified for Jehovah God.

01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:57.420
My God is with you.

01:11:57.420 --> 01:12:00.420
Thank you for this indescribable gift of being trained

01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:05.420
to help strengthen and stabilize his people wherever we may serve.

01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:10.939
Your brothers, Class 157.

01:12:10.939 --> 01:12:12.939
It has been accomplished.

01:12:13.939 --> 01:12:15.939
We are proud of you.

01:12:15.939 --> 01:12:18.939
Not for the academic achievement that you have

01:12:18.939 --> 01:12:21.939
driven forward during this class,

01:12:21.939 --> 01:12:24.939
but the remarkable effect, the wisdom,

01:12:24.939 --> 01:12:29.939
the love that you have developed during this divine education.

01:12:29.939 --> 01:12:32.939
We anticipate the strengthening and stabilizing

01:12:32.939 --> 01:12:37.939
that you will do in your respective branch territories.

01:12:37.939 --> 01:12:41.939
In the introduction we discussed the need for all of us to stay hungry.

01:12:42.939 --> 01:12:44.939
Well, what about stay thirsty?

01:12:44.939 --> 01:12:46.939
Let's consider that for just a moment.

01:12:46.939 --> 01:12:51.939
Let's discuss one thirst that we need to quench every single day.

01:12:51.939 --> 01:12:55.939
Invite you to open to Psalm 143.

01:12:55.939 --> 01:12:59.939
And notice with me, please, verses 5 and 6.

01:12:59.939 --> 01:13:03.939
Psalm 143, verses 5 and 6, their David said,

01:13:03.939 --> 01:13:05.939
I remember the days of old.

01:13:05.939 --> 01:13:07.939
I meditate on all your activity.

01:13:07.939 --> 01:13:10.939
I eagerly ponder over the work of your hands.

01:13:11.939 --> 01:13:13.939
I spread out my hands to you.

01:13:13.939 --> 01:13:19.939
I am like a parched land that thirsts for you.

01:13:19.939 --> 01:13:22.939
So David thirsted for Jehovah.

01:13:22.939 --> 01:13:26.939
Thirst for Jehovah as a parched land thirsts for water.

01:13:26.939 --> 01:13:28.939
Water makes the land revive.

01:13:28.939 --> 01:13:30.939
It makes it flourish.

01:13:30.939 --> 01:13:34.939
Like a dry, crusty riverbed in Africa is revived in flourishes

01:13:34.939 --> 01:13:37.939
when distant rains come and saturate the soil.

01:13:37.939 --> 01:13:41.939
So we want to satisfy our thirst for Jehovah on a daily basis.

01:13:41.939 --> 01:13:42.939
How?

01:13:42.939 --> 01:13:43.939
How do we do that?

01:13:43.939 --> 01:13:48.939
Well, we want to continue to learn more about our father on a daily basis,

01:13:48.939 --> 01:13:50.939
digging into his word.

01:13:50.939 --> 01:13:52.939
Hosea 6 verse 3 says that,

01:13:52.939 --> 01:13:55.939
we will know, we will earnestly seek to know Jehovah.

01:13:55.939 --> 01:13:57.939
He will come to us like a pouring rain,

01:13:57.939 --> 01:14:02.939
like a spring rain that saturates the earth.

01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:06.939
Even at Gilead, you have only learned the fringes of Jehovah's ways.

01:14:07.939 --> 01:14:11.939
So there's so much more that's available through the organization,

01:14:11.939 --> 01:14:13.939
through Jehovah's organization.

01:14:13.939 --> 01:14:15.939
Keep thirsting, keep learning.

01:14:15.939 --> 01:14:18.939
So learning about Jehovah, another thing,

01:14:18.939 --> 01:14:21.939
maintain a regular routine of prayer.

01:14:21.939 --> 01:14:26.939
Pray constantly is what first Thessalonians 5 verse 17 tells us.

01:14:26.939 --> 01:14:28.939
The study note Paul says,

01:14:28.939 --> 01:14:31.939
Paul was not expecting the Thessalonians to pray at every moment.

01:14:31.939 --> 01:14:35.939
Rather, he was encouraging them to have a prayerful attitude.

01:14:35.939 --> 01:14:37.939
So thirst for Jehovah.

01:14:37.939 --> 01:14:40.939
Keep your relationship with him close.

01:14:40.939 --> 01:14:42.939
Always look to Jehovah.

01:14:42.939 --> 01:14:45.939
And will Jehovah satisfy your thirst for him?

01:14:45.939 --> 01:14:47.939
Absolutely.

01:14:47.939 --> 01:14:51.939
We can learn something from what occurred in Samson's life.

01:14:51.939 --> 01:14:53.939
It's found in judges chapter 15.

01:14:53.939 --> 01:15:00.699
And just as we had assurance earlier that Jehovah will care for your spiritual hunger,

01:15:00.699 --> 01:15:03.699
he will care for your thirst as well.

01:15:03.699 --> 01:15:05.699
In chapter 15, interestingly,

01:15:05.699 --> 01:15:08.699
verses 17 through 19, Samson's life,

01:15:08.699 --> 01:15:16.140
he had just experienced, as the verse says,

01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:18.140
Jehovah's spirit empowered him.

01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:20.140
He became absorbed in a Theocratic assignment,

01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:22.140
fighting Jehovah's enemies, the Philistines,

01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:24.140
and with the jawbone of a donkey,

01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:26.140
killed 1,000 Philistines.

01:15:26.140 --> 01:15:27.140
Then what?

01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:28.140
Verse 17 says,

01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:29.140
when he finished speaking,

01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:32.140
he threw the jawbone away and he called the place,

01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:34.140
and he called on Jehovah and said,

01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:36.140
it was you who gave this great salvation

01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:37.140
into the hand of your servant.

01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:39.140
But now, am I to die of thirst and fall

01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:41.140
into the hands of the uncircumcised?

01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:45.140
So God split open a hollow that was in Lehigh

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:47.140
and water flowed from it.

01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:49.140
When he drank,

01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:52.140
his spirit returned, and he revived.

01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:55.140
That is why he named the place,

01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:57.140
and Hakkori,

01:15:57.140 --> 01:15:59.140
which is in the name of Jesus.

01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:00.140
He named the place,

01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:01.140
and Hakkori,

01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:04.140
which is in Lehigh to this day.

01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:06.140
And Hakkori,

01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:08.140
where Jehovah's split open a hollow

01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:10.140
to satisfy Samson's thirst,

01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:11.140
his spirit returned.

01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:12.140
He revived.

01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:14.140
So what's the point?

01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:19.140
There's no antitipical jawbone of a donkey, no.

01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:21.140
But in future days,

01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:24.140
you will certainly be busy in Theocratic assignments,

01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:27.140
just as Samson was.

01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:30.140
Be sure to return to end Hakkori,

01:16:30.140 --> 01:16:33.140
regularly, and revive your spirit

01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:35.140
by drawing close to our God.

01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:38.140
He is a lifeline to your success.

01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:40.140
Stay hungry.

01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:42.140
Stay thirsty.

01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:45.140
Dear Gilead graduates.

01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:47.140
For this Gilead graduation,

01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:49.140
and for any occasion of eating and drinking

01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:50.140
at Jehovah's table,

01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:53.140
may our heart sentiments be those of the Psalmist,

01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:55.140
Psalm 107,

01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:58.140
verses 1 and 9.

01:16:58.140 --> 01:16:59.140
There it says,

01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:00.140
give thanks to Jehovah

01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:01.140
for he is good,

01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:04.140
his loyal love endures forever.

01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:07.140
That ties in with Brother Mark's talk, too.

01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:08.140
Verse 9 says,

01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:12.140
for he has satisfied the thirsty,

01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:14.140
and filled the hungry

01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:16.140
with good things.

01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:19.140
So all praise goes to Jehovah

01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:22.140
for his bounteous spiritual gifts to us.

01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:24.140
Dear Gilead graduates.

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:26.140
Stay hungry for spiritual food

01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:28.140
and for God's righteousness.

01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:30.140
Stay thirsty for Jehovah

01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:32.140
on a daily basis.

01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:34.140
And he, our loving Father,

01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:35.140
will continue to fill you up

01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:37.140
with an abundance of rich dishes.

01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:40.140
We love you all very much.

01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:42.140
How faith, strengthening,

01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:44.140
and encouraging,

01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:46.140
not only for the Gilead graduates,

01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:48.140
but for each of us.

01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:50.140
And there's more.

01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:52.140
In the next few weeks,

01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:54.140
look for additional talks

01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:56.140
from the graduation

01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:58.140
and the JW Library app

01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:00.140
and then the video section

01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:02.140
on JW.org.

01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:04.140
For this month's postcard,

01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:08.119
we travel to the Netherlands.

01:18:08.119 --> 01:18:10.119
The Netherlands means

01:18:10.119 --> 01:18:12.119
the lowlands,

01:18:12.119 --> 01:18:14.119
a fitting name for a country

01:18:14.119 --> 01:18:16.119
of more than a quarter of its land

01:18:16.119 --> 01:18:18.119
below sea level,

01:18:18.119 --> 01:18:20.119
and nearly 20%

01:18:20.119 --> 01:18:22.119
iconic windmills

01:18:22.119 --> 01:18:24.119
and wooden shoes are reminders

01:18:24.119 --> 01:18:26.119
that managing water

01:18:26.119 --> 01:18:28.119
is a way of life here.

01:18:28.119 --> 01:18:30.119
An ingenious system

01:18:30.119 --> 01:18:32.119
of dunes, dikes, pumps,

01:18:32.119 --> 01:18:34.119
and barriers protects against floods.

01:18:34.119 --> 01:18:36.119
Life's water

01:18:36.119 --> 01:18:38.119
of Bible truth started flowing

01:18:38.119 --> 01:18:40.119
into this land

01:18:40.119 --> 01:18:42.119
in the early 1900s.

01:18:42.119 --> 01:18:44.119
By the beginning of World War II,

01:18:44.119 --> 01:18:48.119
there were about 500 Jehovah's Witnesses here.

01:18:48.119 --> 01:18:50.119
They offered severe persecution

01:18:50.119 --> 01:18:52.119
by the Occupy Nazis.

01:18:52.119 --> 01:18:54.119
Over 300

01:18:54.119 --> 01:18:56.119
of our brothers were deported

01:18:56.119 --> 01:18:58.119
to concentration camps.

01:18:58.119 --> 01:19:00.119
Sadly,

01:19:00.119 --> 01:19:02.119
more than 130 of them died.

01:19:02.119 --> 01:19:04.119
Despite these challenges,

01:19:04.119 --> 01:19:06.119
with Jehovah's help,

01:19:06.119 --> 01:19:08.119
and the faithful stand

01:19:08.119 --> 01:19:10.119
of our brothers and sisters,

01:19:10.119 --> 01:19:12.119
the preaching work accelerated.

01:19:12.119 --> 01:19:16.119
In August 1945,

01:19:16.119 --> 01:19:18.119
at the first convention held

01:19:18.119 --> 01:19:20.119
after the war,

01:19:20.119 --> 01:19:22.119
4,000 were in attendance.

01:19:22.119 --> 01:19:24.119
Today,

01:19:24.119 --> 01:19:26.119
about 30,000 witnesses

01:19:26.119 --> 01:19:28.119
zealously preach here.

01:19:28.119 --> 01:19:30.119
The number of regular

01:19:30.119 --> 01:19:32.119
and special pioneers

01:19:32.119 --> 01:19:34.119
increased a total of 36%

01:19:34.119 --> 01:19:36.119
in the last three years.

01:19:36.119 --> 01:19:38.119
You'll see bicycles

01:19:38.119 --> 01:19:40.119
just about everywhere in the Netherlands.

01:19:40.119 --> 01:19:42.119
Nearly 30%

01:19:42.119 --> 01:19:44.119
of all journeys are made by bicycle.

01:19:44.119 --> 01:19:46.119
Our brothers and sisters

01:19:46.119 --> 01:19:48.119
love to engage in the ministry

01:19:48.119 --> 01:19:50.119
on two wheels.

01:19:50.119 --> 01:19:52.119
In a country known for its

01:19:52.119 --> 01:19:54.119
many waterways,

01:19:54.119 --> 01:19:56.119
publishers preach from boat to boat

01:19:56.119 --> 01:19:58.119
and from ship to ship,

01:19:58.119 --> 01:20:00.119
such as in Rotterdam,

01:20:00.119 --> 01:20:04.119
which manages the biggest harbor in Europe.

01:20:04.119 --> 01:20:06.119
We end our visit in Layden,

01:20:06.119 --> 01:20:08.119
a beautiful historic city.

01:20:08.119 --> 01:20:10.119
This is where the famous

01:20:10.119 --> 01:20:12.119
Dutch painter Rembrandt

01:20:12.119 --> 01:20:14.119
was born in 1606.

01:20:14.119 --> 01:20:16.119
One of the two congregations

01:20:16.119 --> 01:20:18.119
in Layden is Decoy.

01:20:18.119 --> 01:20:20.119
Their territory is

01:20:20.119 --> 01:20:22.119
close to the tool of fields,

01:20:22.119 --> 01:20:24.119
which bloom from April to May

01:20:24.119 --> 01:20:26.119
and attract millions of tourists

01:20:26.119 --> 01:20:28.119
every year.

01:20:28.119 --> 01:20:30.119
Traditional Dutch cuisine is known

01:20:30.119 --> 01:20:32.119
for herring,

01:20:32.119 --> 01:20:34.119
pastries, and strupe waffles.

01:20:34.119 --> 01:20:36.119
A delicious treat made up

01:20:36.119 --> 01:20:38.119
of two waffle cookies

01:20:38.119 --> 01:20:40.119
held together by syrup.

01:20:40.119 --> 01:20:42.119
The Dutch cheeses are known

01:20:42.119 --> 01:20:44.119
throughout the world,

01:20:44.119 --> 01:20:46.119
including Adam

01:20:46.119 --> 01:20:48.119
and Howda,

01:20:48.119 --> 01:20:50.119
named for the towns in which they

01:20:50.119 --> 01:20:52.119
originated.

01:20:52.119 --> 01:20:54.119
Many of the Decoy

01:20:54.119 --> 01:20:56.119
congregations, 129 publishers,

01:20:56.119 --> 01:20:58.119
visited the picturesque

01:20:58.119 --> 01:21:00.119
Mirberger-Molen-Wennmill

01:21:00.119 --> 01:21:02.119
to send you their love

01:21:02.119 --> 01:21:04.119
and affection.

01:21:04.119 --> 01:21:06.119
From the world headquarters

01:21:06.119 --> 01:21:08.119
of Jehovah's Witnesses,
