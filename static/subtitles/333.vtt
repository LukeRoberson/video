00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:09.279
Faith. Faith in this simple expression that we have in our days text today has allowed

00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:18.699
imperfect people to do extraordinary things, including moving forward and accepting enormous

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:25.600
changes in assignments, moving to new lands, really being able to face challenges of all

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:32.820
kinds. The Apostle Paul discussed the power of this faith in Hebrews chapter 11. Let's

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.899
open our Bibles there. Now here are the Apostle Paul recounted various outstanding examples

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.079
of faith, and he noted what it was that helped these individuals to be able to accomplish

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:54.060
what they did. Let's start with Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 5. Now here Paul starts out

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:00.280
by talking about Enoch. Now we remember Enoch was the one who preached a message against the

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:07.680
ungodly people of his generation, a very wicked generation. Well, what did Jehovah do because

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.200
of that man's great faith in Jehovah's promise? Well, it says in verse 5 that God transferred

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.799
him. I think that was probably the most seamless reassignment in history because he was just

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:28.239
immediately in his new assignment. We're waiting to catch up with him. What a wonderful day

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:34.400
that will be when those living on the earth will be able to meet that faithful man who was reassigned

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.680
to that new earth. But what about Abraham? For Abraham, it was a little bit more complicated.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.760
You see in verse 8, it tells us that Abraham was called when he was living in the city of

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:55.680
earth, no doubt in a very comfortable situation. You'll recall that earth was an advanced city

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.200
in the ancient world. In fact, even having indoor plumbing in many of the homes, very unusual

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:09.520
for its time. But where was Abraham asked to go? Well, according to verse 8, it says, he went out,

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.960
although not knowing where he was going. Now that really took faith, didn't it? Accepting an

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.960
assignment, not even knowing what Jehovah had in mind. Well, why was Abraham able to do that?

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:30.240
He had faith in the promise of a new heavens and a new earth. You see, verse 10, what it says,

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:39.039
for he was awaiting the city having real foundations whose designer and builder is God.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.199
Well, verse 13 adds, speaking of all these ones, including Abraham, in faith all of these died,

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:53.599
although they did not receive the fulfillment of the promises. But they saw them from a distance

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:59.599
and welcomed them and publicly declared that they were strangers and temporary residents in the land.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.840
For those who speak in such a way make it evident that they are earnestly seeking a place of

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.879
their own. And yet, if they had kept remembering the place from which they had departed,

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:16.960
they would have had opportunity to return. Well, an interesting thought, but then it says,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.319
but now they are reaching out for a better place. That is one belonging to heaven. Therefore,

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:30.560
God is not ashamed of them to be called on as their God, for he has prepared a city for them.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:38.560
Well, those men and women of faith, they were willing to be strangers, temporary residents,

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:45.360
go wherever Jehovah asked them to go because of their faith. They knew that Jehovah had a place,

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.439
that new heavens, that new earth, that had been prepared. But they're not the only ones who had faith

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:59.360
like that. Consider Moses. Now at age 40, he made the long journey from Egypt to Midian.

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:06.080
And there, Jehovah had him receive training for the next 40 years. Can you imagine?

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:12.719
Before he gave him the assignment to go back to Egypt and have a role in setting free the Israelites.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.279
Well, of course, his work was only beginning there because then he had to go right back

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:24.639
into the wilderness for another 40 years. Well, his faith meant that he had to move and he had to

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:31.120
take on new assignments. What about Jesus? What does Philippians chapter 2 and verse 7 say?

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.920
So he emptied himself and took a slave's form and became human. Well, now, you want to talk about

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.079
a huge change of assignment? I think that's the biggest one, leaving heaven and coming to earth and

00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:51.680
becoming a human. But Jesus accepted that assignment because of his faith, his faith and the arrangement

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:59.600
that Jehovah had foretold. What about Christian believers in the first century? Now, we're not talking

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:06.079
here about the disciples or the apostles. We're just talking about ordinary average members of the

00:05:06.079 --> 00:05:13.519
congregation in the first century. Well, Acts chapter 8 and verse 1 says that a great persecution

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.720
arose against the congregation that was in Jerusalem. And all except the apostles were scattered

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:27.120
throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria. What did it mean? Everyone had to move.

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:33.680
Every single believer had to move. They were all scattered because of their faith.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.000
Well, what was the result? Actually, something very positive came from it.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.480
Verse 4 says, however, those who had been scattered went through the land declaring the good news of

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:53.040
the word. Well, it actually became a blessing because as those Christians were scattered, they carried

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.720
the kingdom message with them and the truth just continued to prosper. The kingdom message was made known.

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:05.439
Well, what can we see from all of this? It's not unusual for servants of Jehovah to receive new

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:11.759
assignments. And especially ones that may require us to move to new lands, new locations,

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:16.959
accept new assignments, new roles. That's a common thing in the history of God's people.

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:24.959
I recall in 2008, one day I was working at my desk in Patterson, two members of the governing

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:32.160
body called me on a Friday afternoon. They asked me if I would be willing to accept an assignment

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.639
in the Philippines. Well, they said, if you're willing to accept this assignment,

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:42.800
then you're going to begin attending branch school on Monday morning.

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:49.519
Keep in mind, this is Friday at three. Well, I asked them, what about my work? I loved my work

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:57.519
in the service department. The brothers said, just walk away. Well, Monday morning, I was in branch

00:06:57.519 --> 00:07:04.160
school. Of course, when you receive an assignment like that, so many different feelings go through

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:12.639
your mind and heart, including joy, fear, excitement, anxiety, perhaps even a measure of terror.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.680
And I'll have to say, I'll never forget the day when that van finally pulled up to take me to

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:26.480
the airport to go to the Philippines. And I realized that now I was cutting my ties with the

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:32.560
U.S. branch in a sense and moving on to a completely new assignment. I was really leaving.

00:07:33.279 --> 00:07:39.920
It was quite a feeling. But in a short time, I saw that in my new assignment,

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:47.120
I had found a whole new spiritual family. And they had a work that was so enjoyable and so rewarding

00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:54.079
that I truly, truly hated to leave it when I was reassigned to come back to the United States.

00:07:54.879 --> 00:08:01.519
I often, in fact, think of how much I would have missed out in my life if I would have said no

00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:10.639
to that new assignment. It truly enriched my life. Well, our faith in that promise of the new heavens

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:18.480
and a new earth will cause us to move also. Certainly, all of us who live here in Brooklyn are all

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:26.959
going to move. Every one of us. But in truth, every person who has the earthly hope is also going to

00:08:26.959 --> 00:08:32.320
move. They're going to move from this dying world into God's new world of righteousness.

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:38.879
And what about the anointed? All of those anointed ones who received their final ceiling.

00:08:38.879 --> 00:08:44.559
Well, they're all going to have to move to the heavens, aren't they? So if and when Jehovah

00:08:44.559 --> 00:08:51.840
has in mind for us to take up a new assignment, let's move ahead with full faith and confidence,

00:08:52.399 --> 00:08:58.960
knowing that Jehovah has wonderful, wonderful blessings in store for us and that he will lovingly

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:09.679
and generally and generously care for us no matter where we go.
