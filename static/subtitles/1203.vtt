Well, I have the privilege of being part of a delegation of brothers from 18 countries who've been assigned by the governing body to attend the Supreme Court hearing in Moscow and July the 17th.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.489
The principal objective is to just show unity and support for our brothers.

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:24.489
I'm going to Russia in order to be of encouragement for the local Russian brothers and sisters there.

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:34.490
I will encourage them to continue to obey Jehovah as ruler rather than men.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:45.490
And our intent is to try and visit as many of the embassies and speak to a variety of different high officials about what's happening right now with our brothers in Russia.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:58.490
And really when you think of it, this is almost a way of saying that our international brotherhood is all coming to the defense or to the aid of our brothers in Russia.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.489
And actually when you think about it when you meditate on it, it really is a very, very beautiful thing.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:19.489
Jehovah has everything under control and whatever the outcome may be, there is no doubt that Jehovah will continue to strengthen our brothers.
