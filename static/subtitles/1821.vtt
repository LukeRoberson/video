00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:08.349
Welcome to Extraordinary Experiences, where we hear faith-strengthening stories from our brothers and sisters serving in all different parts of the world.

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:14.349
We're very happy today to have with us Brother Miguel and Sister Numerite Gayang serving at the branch in Venezuela.

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:19.350
They attended the 144th class of Gilead. It's very nice to have you here with us today, welcome.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.350
Thank you.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:26.350
Venezuela recently has been experiencing serious economic problems.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.350
Can you explain to us, Miguel, just what the situation is presently?

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:38.350
In the past, Venezuela was a normal country, but for some years has been suffering a situation of civil unrest.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:48.350
Right now, there is a severe shortages of food and medicines that make it very difficult to find the most basic products.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.350
So how do they cope with this challenge?

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.350
Well, they are seeking first the kingdom despite the situation.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.350
They are happy, smiling, laughing, sharing everything they have between them.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:13.349
So we can say that despite their physical poverty, they are more rich than ever in love, faith and generosity.

00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:21.349
With an excellent example, in this climate, in these circumstances, how has the preaching work been affected?

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:27.349
Well, in some areas that is very dangerous because it's a lot of violence in the street.

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:38.349
But it's amazing to see how, even in this situation, they have the courage to go to share the good news to the people,

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:43.349
because they know that people really need to listen the message in this moment.

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:51.349
During the first months of this service year, 2,000 publishers get baptized.

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:57.349
And we have in the country 33,000 regular pioneers.

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:01.349
That's remarkable. This is such a spirit, a pioneer spirit.

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:07.349
No, Marie, what trials of our brothers and sisters have affected you personally?

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:11.349
Well, the suffering of one family really affected me.

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:20.349
First, men came to the kingdom hall and stole all the belongings of the brothers and the car of one brother of that family.

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:28.349
One month later, the same men came to the kingdom hall and they shot the father in a leg.

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:37.349
Because this situation, the sister, the mother was very nervous and the family decided to move and to left the country.

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.349
But when they were preparing, they'd documentation.

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:49.349
The mother was kicked up. And for days later, she was killed.

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.349
When I heard that, I felt so bad, so discouraged.

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:04.349
But that same week came, we went to the convention, regional convention, and was so amazing to see the brother who lost his wife.

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:15.349
That same week, given a talk, he was there speaking with the serenity about the experiences of Job.

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:27.349
It showed me that Jehovah was helping them with his Holy Spirit and also was helping us through them to fight the situation.

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.349
Yes, and I'm sure this is just one of many such situations in Venezuela.

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:39.349
How would you say Jehovah is helping the brothers to cope and you to cope with this crisis?

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:45.349
Frankly, the situation sometimes looks very, very scary.

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:57.349
But thanks to Gilead, we don't have fear to return, not because we are so special or so strong.

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:03.349
But if we have Jehovah with us, there is no reason to fear.

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:08.349
And we want to transmit these feelings to our beloved brothers.

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:09.349
Thank you.

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:15.349
Once in class, the instructor was telling us how important is Joey?

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:20.350
And how can we face the situation in our assignments?

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.350
And he said that only because the joy of Jehovah is our stronghold.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.350
In that moment, I had to cry.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:37.350
I immediately thought about the brothers and sisters in my congregation, those families who have faced so many difficult things.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.350
How can they face that situation?

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.350
How they can be in the kingdom hall?

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.350
Is my name sharing what they have?

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:52.350
How? How they can be like these in this difficult time?

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.350
It's because the joy of Jehovah is our stronghold.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.350
That's a beautiful point number. Thank you very much.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:03.350
And again, we thank you both very, very much for sharing your experiences with us today.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:04.350
Thank you.
