00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:11.669
When was the last time you lost your patience on the road at work or at home?

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:17.070
Our busy lives make it difficult for us to be patient

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.030
But to enjoy life we need patients more than ever even if it's being tested

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.550
But what does patients really mean?

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.549
Does it mean we just passively wait for something to change?

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:37.549
And how can patients affect our daily life?

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.700
The 2023 Exercise Patients Convention of Jehovah's Witnesses will show you what true patients is

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.700
Why we need it?

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.700
And how it can improve our relationships with others

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:01.539
God wants you to be happy

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:08.540
And as our creator he knows that exercising patience is vital
