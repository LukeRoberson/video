00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:13.250
Solomon had three horrible half-brothers, Amnon, Adonijah, and Absalom.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.929
They were a lot older than he was, but Solomon didn't try to imitate them, and he didn't

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:24.570
allow himself to be stumbled by their bad conduct, as if to say, well, if that's the kind

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.769
of people they have around here, I want nothing to do with your hopeless witnesses.

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.170
So Solomon followed his own path.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:37.490
He developed a strong personal relationship with Jehovah God.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:45.250
And remember what the Bible says about Solomon in the beginning, Jehovah loved him, isn't

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.250
that nice?

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.250
Wouldn't you love it if that were said about you, I would?

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.090
Jehovah loved Solomon.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.289
And Jehovah blessed Solomon in many ways.

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.090
For example, while Solomon was faithful, Israel was at peace.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.409
In fact, Solomon said, Jehovah, my God, has given me rest all around.

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:13.450
There is no one opposing me, and I have nothing bad is happening.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:20.689
So it was only after Solomon became unfaithful that resistors were raised up in Israel.

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:27.769
Not only was Israel at peace when Solomon was at peace with God, but Israel was rich.

00:01:27.769 --> 00:01:29.730
Solomon had no financial problems.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.650
The Bible says that the silver was as common as the stones.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:40.409
But when Solomon started drawing away from Jehovah, Jehovah withdrew his blessing.

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.409
And so that prosperity didn't last even during Solomon's reign.

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.609
This site tells us there was a drain on Israel's economy.

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:54.769
A Solomon was still spending money as if it were going out of style.

00:01:54.769 --> 00:01:57.810
But he didn't have the income that he once had.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.650
And so even materially Israel suffered and reaborm did not inherit the wealth from Solomon

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.849
that Solomon had had at the peak of his reign.

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:15.050
Now as our comment points out for much of his reign, Solomon did a lot of good things.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.490
What is it possible that right from the beginning, as involved as Solomon was in theocratic

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:31.889
projects, there was a little red flag that something wasn't quite right, it's possible.

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:37.210
Now as our comment points out, when Solomon became king, he was a young man, but he was

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.169
a young married man.

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:44.969
In fact, when he became king, Solomon had probably been married for a couple of years already.

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:45.969
He had a little boy.

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:46.969
He was a daddy.

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:52.090
He had a little boy, one year old, reaborm.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.849
But who was his wife?

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.050
Probably his first wife.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.969
She was an ammonitus.

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:03.210
Ammonitus.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.330
What do we remember about ammonitus?

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:13.530
Oh yes, Deuteronomy chapter 23 and verse 3.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.479
Now remember, when Solomon gets married, King David is still alive.

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:22.159
David is probably at the wedding.

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:27.080
Now here's what Deuteronomy 23 says.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:33.599
No ammonite or mohobite may come into the congregation of Jehovah.

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:40.919
Even to the tenth generation, none of their descendants may ever come into the congregation

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.159
of Jehovah.

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:48.199
But a part of never did Solomon not understand.

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:55.879
And so could that mean that even before he became king, Solomon had a casual view of Jehovah's

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:57.840
laws on marriage?

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.840
It's possible.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.240
Well, why do we say possible?

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.159
Well without being dogmatic, insight says that there may have been exceptions for foreign

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:10.639
women like Ruth, the mohobitis.

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:18.720
Inside also says that Solomon's ammonite wife possibly contributed to his apostasy.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:28.810
In any event, why was the first wife a foreign woman and an animitis to boot?

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:36.490
Now if Solomon had married a nice Jewish girl, just one, and rejoiced with the wife of

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.850
his youth, don't you think that the history of Israel would have been much different?

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.490
I think it would have been.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:50.089
Now let's take a moment to think about the women Solomon did marry, pagan women.

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:53.569
Now you may have relatives who are not in the truth.

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:57.810
You love your relatives and you go visit from time to time.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.810
But how long is it before you run out of things to talk about?

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:07.410
Because we just don't have the most important thing in common, the truth.

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.529
What do we have to ask?

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:14.689
Why was Solomon so comfortable with these pagan women?

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:15.769
What did he talk about?

00:05:15.769 --> 00:05:21.250
Well, you can be sure he wasn't studying the watchtower with them, but what was he doing?

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.850
What was the attraction to these foreign women?

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:34.569
Was it their humility, their modest dress, their chased conduct, their quiet and mild

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:39.970
spirit, or was it mainly the physical?

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.449
Let's be blunt.

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:49.209
Solomon was attracted to the wrong kind of woman, and there may have been early warning

00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:51.250
signs.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:57.129
Speaking of red flags, when Solomon began marrying many women, I did a prophet or a priest

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:03.769
ever approach him, and give him some counsel, did they ever read the Deuteronomy 17, 17

00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:10.290
which applied directly to the king, Deuteronomy 17, 17?

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:17.050
It says about the king, neither should he take many wives for himself, so that his heart

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.089
may not go astray.

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:24.689
Well, if he did receive that counsel, he certainly didn't apply it, and if he didn't receive

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:27.810
that counsel, we wonder why not.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.290
Well, what's the application?

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:39.370
Today we may be very busy in Jehovah's organization, but we have to be alert to any red flags

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.610
that, despite outward appearances, all is not well with us.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:48.209
A single brother is a regular publisher.

00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:53.089
He is a regular meeting attender, but on his night nights off, he likes to go to night

00:06:53.089 --> 00:06:57.089
clubs, and he's comfortable in that atmosphere.

00:06:57.089 --> 00:07:03.009
He isn't shy about striking up conversations with worldly people, and he loves to dance.

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:08.290
Well, there are no sisters there, so he dances with worldly women.

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:10.089
What's the attraction?

00:07:10.089 --> 00:07:16.370
He's busy in the congregation, but there's something there that isn't quite right.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.329
A young pioneer brother loves to flirt.

00:07:20.329 --> 00:07:24.170
Several young sisters think he's interested only in them.

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:28.730
The attention makes them feel special.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:35.050
A ministerial servant spends a lot of time talking to a married woman.

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:39.209
When he's asked about it, he justifies it and says, we're just friends.

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:43.209
We're just talking, famous last words.

00:07:43.209 --> 00:07:48.529
A fine young sister is offended when an older sister approaches her and points out that

00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:52.930
her skirts and jeans are too tight to revealing.

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:58.050
Well, all these are red flags.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:02.449
We need to examine ourselves from time to time to see whether, no matter how many privileges

00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:08.449
we have, something isn't quite right.

00:08:08.449 --> 00:08:14.410
When it comes to choosing a mate, Solomon's example can be instructive to us, how what

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:21.370
qualities do we value in a marriage mate, spiritual qualities, or is it mainly the physical

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:25.050
and we hope that the spiritual will catch up later.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:28.850
A young sister is getting acquainted with a young brother.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:29.850
He's really good-looking.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:36.129
Has a great personality that gets along with everybody, but how's he doing spiritually?

00:08:36.129 --> 00:08:40.570
Does he have a good schedule for theocratic activities and does he stick to it?

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:46.090
For example, if you mention an article in a recent magazine, does he often say, I must have

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:47.929
missed that one?

00:08:47.929 --> 00:08:50.490
And that's what happens.

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:51.970
It's a bad sign.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:56.490
Does he make spiritual activities a priority in his life?

00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:00.649
If he doesn't do that while he's single, what makes you think that he's going to do it

00:09:00.649 --> 00:09:03.049
after you get married?

00:09:03.049 --> 00:09:08.570
Will you change him or will he change you?

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:13.610
Because our comment reminds us, Solomon and Joe had many privileges, but he apparently

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:16.490
felt that some of God's laws just didn't apply to him.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:17.490
Why not?

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.009
Well, we don't know.

00:09:19.009 --> 00:09:25.370
Could it be what Solomon said in Ecclesiastes, the King does whatever he wants?

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.529
Maybe so.

00:09:27.529 --> 00:09:32.490
Solomon multiplied horses and acquired many wives for himself.

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:34.929
So what's the lesson for us?

00:09:34.929 --> 00:09:38.529
No matter how long we've been in the truth, no matter how many privileges we've

00:09:38.529 --> 00:09:45.769
we have, no matter how much Jehovah has used us, we can't afford to let down our guard.

00:09:45.769 --> 00:09:52.129
We must guard our heart, and we mustn't ignore any red flags that might indicate that

00:09:52.129 --> 00:09:53.929
all is not well.
