00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.459
Welcome to JW Broadcasting.

00:00:04.459 --> 00:00:09.460
In this month's program, we'll learn from past examples

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.460
and look ahead to our wonderful hope for the future.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.460
Here are some highlights.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.460
We can allow trials to rob us of our joy.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.460
But in this dramatization, we'll see how a family

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.460
can still rejoice in the hope after a natural disaster.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.460
A visit to Bethel has started many young ones

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.460
on the path to spiritual goals.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.460
We'll tour Bethel with these young ones

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.460
and hear how they felt about their visit.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.460
And we'll enjoy previews of the spiritual program

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.460
that's been prepared for us when we attend the 2016

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.460
Remain Loyal to Jehovah Convention.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.460
This is the April 2016 edition

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:17.920
of JW Broadcasting.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.920
The theme of this program is look back to learn,

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.920
look ahead to live.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.920
It's based on Isaiah, chapter 30, verse 21,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.920
which was written about 700 years before Christ.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.920
The question is, how might we apply Isaiah 30-21

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.920
to Jehovah's people today?

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.920
The text reads,

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.920
and your own ears will hear a word behind you,

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.920
saying, this is the way.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.920
Walk in it, in case you should go to the right,

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.920
or in case you should go to the left.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.920
This scripture tells us that Jehovah's word

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.920
comes from behind his people,

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.920
issuing directions on the right way to walk.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.919
When we turn to God's word for guidance,

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.919
we are reading words that were recorded thousands of years ago,

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:17.919
coming from behind us as it were in the stream of time.

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:22.919
This ties in nicely with Paul's words at Romans 15-4.

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:25.919
For all the things that were written beforehand

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:29.919
were written for our instruction.

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:31.919
There are many things that we can learn

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:34.919
by looking back at Bible characters,

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:37.919
examining their attitude, conduct,

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:41.919
and quality of faith can help us to make wise decisions

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:44.919
and to avoid pitfalls.

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:47.919
Also, we need to appreciate that experience

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:50.919
is not always the best teacher.

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:53.919
Some people go through life only learning lessons

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:56.919
after making one painful mistake after another.

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:02.919
It is far better to learn from examples of the past.

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:05.919
Looking back to our first human parents,

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:10.919
we see clearly the importance of obeying Jehovah.

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:13.919
For hundreds of years, Adam and Eve

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:17.919
must have looked back to the life they had in the Garden of Eden

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:22.919
before they sinned, but they felt no joy in doing so.

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.919
As they grew older and more decrepit,

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:28.919
they must have been filled with sadness and bitterness,

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:33.919
and there may have been many exchanges of unkind words.

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:37.919
Yes, they looked back at what they lost,

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:41.919
but it did not benefit them for they were created perfect

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:45.919
and were willfully disobedient to God.

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:50.919
Noah, who was born about 126 years after Adam died,

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:55.919
would have known of Adam's disobedience and its consequences.

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:59.919
Noah looked back and benefited from that knowledge.

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:04.919
He obeyed Jehovah and fixed his eyes on the unseen future,

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:07.919
the foretold earth-wide flood.

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:10.919
Also, he kept busy constructing an ark

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.919
and preaching to the people of his day.

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.920
It is only reasonable to believe that Noah's three sons

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.920
cooperated fully with him and building the ark.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.920
But what about the wives of Noah's sons?

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.920
There is no mention of their families in Scripture.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.920
The wives of Noah's sons must have been strong in faith,

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.920
determined to stick with their husbands and with God's servant Noah,

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.920
even though none of their family members went into the ark for survival.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:51.360
The wives of Noah's sons provide an example for serious thought.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.360
A few hundred years after the flood,

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.360
Abraham and Sarah left the city of Ur to serve Jehovah.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.360
Wherever he designated, they looked ahead

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.360
and kept their eyes fixed on the promises of God.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.360
The Apostle Paul indicates that Abraham and Sarah did not dwell

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.360
on what they left behind.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.360
Paul makes that point in Hebrews 1115

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.360
and what a good lesson it is for us.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:31.879
Hebrews 11 and verse 15 reads,

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:36.879
and yet if they had kept remembering the place

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:38.879
from which they had departed,

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:42.879
they would have had opportunity to return.

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:45.879
Like Abraham and Sarah,

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:47.879
we want to keep our attention fixed,

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:50.879
not on the things that we have left behind,

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:52.879
but rather on serving Jehovah

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:56.879
and on His promises for the future.

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:59.879
Lot was a contemporary of Abraham,

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:04.879
and there are vital lessons we can learn from the account about Lot's wife.

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:10.879
Genesis 1912 and 13 tell us not only that Sodom would be destroyed,

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:15.879
but also that Lot and His people in the city should flee immediately.

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:20.879
Then verse 17 says that as soon as the angels had brought Lot and His family

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:22.879
to the outskirts of Sodom,

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:24.879
they were told,

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:26.879
escape for your life,

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:28.879
do not look behind you,

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:32.879
and do not stand still in any part of the district,

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:38.879
escape to the mountainous region so that you may not be swept away.

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:40.879
After fleeing Sodom,

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:45.879
Lot's wife disobeyed God by looking back.

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:49.879
What may have been involved in her looking back?

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:55.879
There is nothing to indicate that she in any way approved of the immorality of Sodom,

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:58.879
but was her attachment to her home

00:06:58.879 --> 00:07:03.879
and the material things she had there stronger than her love for God?

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:05.879
Whatever her reason,

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:10.879
what Jesus said at Luke chapter 17,

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:12.879
verses 31 and 32,

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:17.879
emphasizes the importance of obedience and urgency.

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:19.879
He said,

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:22.879
Luke 17, 31,

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:24.879
on that day

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:27.879
let the person who is on the house top

00:07:27.879 --> 00:07:29.879
but whose belongings are in the house

00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:32.879
not come down to pick these up,

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:38.879
and likewise the person out in the field must not return to the things behind.

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:42.879
And notice the way Jesus now ties together

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:46.879
urgency with obedience in verse 32.

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:51.879
Remember the wife of Lot.

00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:54.879
Genesis 1926 says

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:59.879
that Lot's wife disobediently began to look back

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:03.879
and she became a pillar of salt.

00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:11.879
Consider this thought provoking comment on pages 18 and 19 of the April 15, 1990 issue of the watchtower.

00:08:11.879 --> 00:08:19.699
Now a further test of loyalty faced Lot and his daughters.

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:22.699
Was Lot's attachment to his deceased wife

00:08:22.699 --> 00:08:27.699
or the girl's feelings for their dead mother stronger than their love for Jehovah

00:08:27.699 --> 00:08:30.699
who had brought about this calamity?

00:08:30.699 --> 00:08:33.700
Would they continue to obey God

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:38.700
even though someone very close to them proved disloyal to him?

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.700
With full trust in Jehovah

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.700
they did not look back.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:48.700
Is there not a lesson in this account for us?

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:54.110
Moses looked to Jehovah for his blessings

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:58.110
and not to the position of privilege that he had in Egypt.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.110
We want to be like Moses

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:05.110
and not fantasize about wealth, possessions, and fame.

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:08.110
And what about her?

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:12.110
What can we learn by examining his life?

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:16.110
No, this is not the bend her from the movie.

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:21.110
This her lived during the time period of Moses and Joshua.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:23.110
Like many of Jehovah's people,

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:27.110
he played a supporting role in doing God's will.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:29.110
We don't know much about him,

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:33.110
but what we do know shows that he was available

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:37.110
and willing to give support to Moses.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:45.110
The account recorded at Exodus chapter 17 verses 8 through 13

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:50.110
occurred shortly after the Israelites left Egypt.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:55.110
Exodus 17 8 through 13 reads us follows.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:10:00.110
Then the Amalakites came and fought against Israel and refid him.

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:02.110
At this, Moses said to Joshua,

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:07.110
choose men for us and go out to fight against the Amalakites.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:10.110
Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.110
with the rod of the true God in my hand.

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:17.110
Then Joshua did just as Moses told him

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:20.110
and he fought against the Amalakites.

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:25.110
And Moses, Aaron, and her went up to the top of the hill.

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:29.110
As long as Moses kept his hands lifted up,

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:31.110
the Israelites prevailed.

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:34.110
But as soon as he would let down his hands,

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:37.110
the Amalakites prevailed.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:40.110
When the hands of Moses were heavy,

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.110
it took a stone and put it under him,

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:44.110
and he sat on it.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:47.110
Then Aaron and her, one on each side,

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:53.110
supported his hands so that his hands remained steady until the sunset.

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:58.110
Thus Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the sword.

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:03.110
The supporting role her played could be viewed as incidental

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:05.110
and not something extraordinary,

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:08.110
since many other men in Israel could have assisted Moses

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:11.110
by holding up one of his hands.

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:15.110
However, we can benefit from her's example.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:19.110
Many brothers and sisters perform essential support work

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:22.110
to advance Kingdom interests.

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:25.110
But they are rarely, if ever, in the limelight,

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:29.110
nor are they well known by the Brotherhood.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:32.110
But Jehovah knows who you are,

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:36.110
and he appreciates what you do.

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:40.110
Hebrews chapter 6, verse 10,

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:42.110
gives us this assurance.

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:45.110
Hebrews 6, 10 reads,

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:50.110
For God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work,

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:53.110
and the love you showed for his name,

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:58.110
by ministering and continuing to minister to the holy ones.

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:03.110
Oftentimes, we humans forget about the good that others do.

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:08.110
But Jehovah never forgets the good works of his faithful servants.

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:13.110
And now consider a man who was a gross wrongdoer,

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:18.110
guilty of the most heinous crimes and violations of God's laws.

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.110
He was King Manasseh.

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:24.110
Not only does the Bible account of his repentance amazes us,

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:29.110
but even more outstanding is the fact that Jehovah accepted his repentance

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:31.110
and showed him mercy.

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:36.110
How kind of Jehovah to allow this account to be in his word?

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:38.110
We look back to Manasseh,

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:42.110
who stands as an example of the great mercy that Jehovah extends

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:46.110
to all who genuinely repent of their wrongdoings

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:49.110
and make straight paths for their feet.

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:53.110
Manasseh's repentance must have been genuine,

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:56.110
for no one can deceive Jehovah.

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:59.110
And Manasseh's example should encourage those

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:03.110
who may think that they have gone too far astray to be forgiven

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:06.110
and receive Jehovah's tender mercies.

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:09.110
How much we appreciate the brochure?

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:11.110
Return to Jehovah.

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:16.110
It constitutes a loving invitation to take the necessary steps

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:22.110
to draw close to Jehovah and then remain in his love.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:26.110
We draw close to the Father through Jesus Christ,

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:29.110
for He Himself declared at John 146,

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:33.110
no one comes to the Father except through Me.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:37.110
Jesus invites us to learn from Him.

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:41.110
In the 2015 Convention Video Drama,

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:44.110
for a certainty God made Him Lord and Christ,

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:47.110
we learn much about Jesus' love for people

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:50.110
and His affection for His disciples.

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:54.110
Unforgettable and heartwarming was the scene of Jesus

00:13:54.110 --> 00:14:00.110
warmly embracing each disciple before ascending to heaven.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:03.110
Did Jesus actually do that?

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:05.110
I don't know.

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:09.110
But it's only reasonable to believe that He would show

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:12.110
such affection to His loyal disciples.

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:15.110
After all, according to John 21, 25,

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:20.110
Jesus did many things that are not recorded in the Scriptures.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:25.110
And Jesus has also proved to be faithful to His promise,

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:30.110
to be with His disciples to the end of the system of things.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:33.110
Do we not see evidence of that today?

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:39.490
The Apostle Peter was someone that most of us can relate to.

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:41.490
After Jesus' resurrection,

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:45.490
Peter became a zealous and fearless preacher of the good news.

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:48.490
He did not look back on His mistakes

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:52.490
and continue beating Himself for denying Jesus three times.

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:56.490
He did not give up because Jesus called Him Satan.

00:14:56.490 --> 00:15:01.490
He did not quit and run away feeling sorry for Himself.

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:06.490
Nor did He quit when Paul reprimanded Him in front of many disciples.

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:11.490
Peter was a humble man who loved Jehovah.

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:16.490
There is much we can learn by looking back on Peter's life.

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:21.490
Never quit or give up in the race for life.

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:24.490
When we are disciplined, we want to imitate Peter

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:27.490
and make the needed changes.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:32.490
We put our full trust in Jesus' ransom sacrifice

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:38.490
that does indeed cleanse us from inherited sin and from our own mistakes.

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:45.490
We must not allow ourselves to be consumed by self-pity and inactivity.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:51.490
Yes, there are many ways that we can benefit from looking back at Peter

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:55.490
and learning from His experiences.

00:15:55.490 --> 00:16:00.490
The Apostle John was another man of great faith and endurance.

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:06.490
At about 99 years of age, the Apostle John looked back some 65 years

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:12.490
and was able with the help of Holy Spirit to remember so much about Jesus' life and works

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:15.490
that He could write the Gospel of John.

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:20.490
He looked back not only to remember what He had learned from Jesus

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:25.490
but also because He wanted future generations to learn about Jesus.

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:30.490
But John also looked ahead with faith in Jehovah's promise

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:36.490
about Jesus as King of the coming kingdom, declaring in the conclusion

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:39.490
of the Book of Revelation, Amen.

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:41.490
Come, Lord Jesus.

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:48.250
Yes, we look back to learn from God's Word

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:51.250
and see the many ways in which it can benefit us.

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:58.250
At the same time, we look ahead to the future, to the real life in the new world

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:03.250
when we will be able to enjoy life in ways not possible today.

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:09.250
How good it is to know the truth, to serve our great God, Jehovah

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:13.250
and to be a part of the worldwide Brotherhood.

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:18.720
In addition to the Bible examples we've considered,

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:23.720
our Brotherhood is rich with modern-day examples of faith.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:27.720
We have an archive interview with Brother Horst Henshel.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:33.720
He and his family face bitter persecution during World War II under Nazi Germany.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:40.720
After the war, he was imprisoned for his faith in the GDR, the former East Germany.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:47.720
When at his lowest point, notice what renewed his strength to endure

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.720
and keep looking ahead.

00:17:55.859 --> 00:18:00.859
My parents had a very strong faith in God and the Bible.

00:18:00.859 --> 00:18:05.859
Of course, Jehovah's Witnesses were banned during the Second World War.

00:18:05.859 --> 00:18:08.859
My mother was arrested and imprisoned.

00:18:08.859 --> 00:18:12.859
My father could not reconcile military service with his conscience

00:18:12.859 --> 00:18:15.859
and therefore he refused to do it.

00:18:15.859 --> 00:18:21.859
Until today I can still see him sitting in front of the kitchen stove

00:18:21.859 --> 00:18:25.859
and looking in the open flames.

00:18:25.859 --> 00:18:28.859
That was the last time I saw him.

00:18:28.859 --> 00:18:33.859
I had to go to school and he went to the district commando

00:18:33.859 --> 00:18:38.859
and explained them that he cannot be a soldier because of his conscience.

00:18:39.859 --> 00:18:44.859
Finally, he was sentenced to death and was executed.

00:18:44.859 --> 00:18:47.859
His last brief came.

00:18:47.859 --> 00:18:51.859
In the beginning of his last letter he wrote,

00:18:51.859 --> 00:18:58.859
be happy when you get his letter because I have endured.

00:18:58.859 --> 00:19:02.859
In two hours I will be executed.

00:19:02.859 --> 00:19:06.859
And then he ends his letter with the words

00:19:06.859 --> 00:19:09.859
of Rida Sin.

00:19:09.859 --> 00:19:11.859
See you again.

00:19:11.859 --> 00:19:15.859
My mother's faith and my father's integrity

00:19:15.859 --> 00:19:20.859
and their belief in the resurrection have had a deep impact in my life

00:19:20.859 --> 00:19:26.619
and I am still very grateful for that.

00:19:26.619 --> 00:19:32.619
Later as a young man of 19 years I also was arrested

00:19:32.619 --> 00:19:37.619
in the former GDR for proclaiming the world of God.

00:19:38.619 --> 00:19:42.619
I was sentenced to 12 years in prison

00:19:42.619 --> 00:19:45.619
but I had only to serve six years.

00:19:45.619 --> 00:19:50.619
What I learned is that Jehovah really helps at the right time.

00:19:50.619 --> 00:19:53.619
The time of interrogation was difficult.

00:19:53.619 --> 00:19:59.619
I was put in a solitary confinement cell in a cell with only very little light.

00:19:59.619 --> 00:20:03.619
I did not have any strength anymore.

00:20:03.619 --> 00:20:07.619
In the cell there was not much, only a plank bed for sleeping

00:20:07.619 --> 00:20:10.619
and on the wall a board with house rules

00:20:10.619 --> 00:20:14.619
that I didn't take notice of.

00:20:14.619 --> 00:20:17.619
I looked at it and I turned it around

00:20:17.619 --> 00:20:19.619
and what did I read on the bank?

00:20:19.619 --> 00:20:22.619
The lyrics of a song of our songbook

00:20:22.619 --> 00:20:26.089
it said,

00:20:26.089 --> 00:20:28.089
fear them not, oh my beloved,

00:20:28.089 --> 00:20:31.089
the men's posting threats may fly.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:37.400
Immediately I regained my strength.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:42.289
I felt like having been at the convention

00:20:42.289 --> 00:20:46.289
because I knew other brothers had also been here

00:20:46.289 --> 00:20:49.289
that had endured and stayed faithful.

00:20:51.289 --> 00:20:55.289
Of course I will never want to forget this incident.

00:20:55.289 --> 00:20:57.289
It showed me very clearly

00:20:57.289 --> 00:21:02.289
that Jehovah really gives us the power beyond what is normal.

00:21:03.289 --> 00:21:06.289
It's like the Bible says,

00:21:06.289 --> 00:21:09.289
the Word of God exerts power.

00:21:09.289 --> 00:21:11.289
Or as it says in Proverbs,

00:21:11.289 --> 00:21:14.289
the name of Jehovah is a strong tower.

00:21:14.289 --> 00:21:18.289
Intuit the righteous one runs and receives protection.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.240
Brother Henshel's experience reminds us

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.240
that spiritual food in whatever form,

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.240
such as a theocratic song,

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:35.240
can strengthen us to keep enduring.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:39.240
Spiritual food is a gift from God

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:43.240
and so is our ability to read it in printed form

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.240
or to enjoy audio and video publications.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.240
For the deaf, however,

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:53.240
that same spiritual food is often out of reach.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.240
To help us understand the challenges

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.240
that most deaf people face,

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:01.240
we've invited Brother Bobby Dunbar to join us.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:04.240
He serves in translation services at World Headquarters

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:09.240
and has spent over 30 years serving in the Sign Language field.

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.240
Welcome, Bobby. We're happy to have you with us.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.240
Thank you.

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:17.240
First question for you. It's a personal one.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.240
What was your first language?

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.240
Both of my parents were deaf.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:25.240
So I grew up using Sign Language at home.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.240
You could say it was my first language

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.240
and English is a second language for me.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:33.240
In the early days before there were Sign Language congregations,

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:37.240
how were the spiritual needs of the deaf cared for?

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:41.240
Our organization actually has a long history with deaf people.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.240
As far back as 1915,

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:48.240
Brother John Gillespie, an anointed pilgrim brother,

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:51.240
was seeing signing songs for deaf people

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:54.240
at a convention in the United States.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.240
And since then, for many, many years,

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.240
there's been interpreting at the meetings and assemblies.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.240
And where brothers didn't know Sign Language at times,

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.240
they even wrote notes for the deaf brothers

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.240
to help them understand what was going on during the program.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.240
We do indeed appreciate those early signers,

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.240
because I know they helped greatly

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:13.240
when there were no Sign Language congregations.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.240
Absolutely.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.240
But where was the first Sign Language congregation formed?

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:20.240
And how many Sign Language congregations are there worldwide,

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.240
including groups?

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:26.240
In 1976, Korea was the first branch

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.240
to establish a Sign Language congregation.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:33.240
And now there are more than 4,000 congregations

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:37.240
in groups that conduct their meetings in Sign Language.

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.240
That's remarkable.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.240
Would you please give us an idea

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.240
of what the organization has accomplished

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:47.240
down through the years in order to assist deaf people

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.240
to come to a knowledge of the truth?

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:55.240
Our website, which contains videos in Sign Language,

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:59.240
Bible-based videos, in more than 80 Sign Languages,

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:03.240
make Bible truths available to deaf people.

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.240
Many of these 80 Sign Languages

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:08.240
have the watchtower available every month.

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:11.240
Some of these Sign Languages actually have Bible books available.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:15.240
And this has been a huge blessing to our deaf brothers and sisters.

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:19.240
In addition to this, the organization has provided an app

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:23.240
for mobile devices that make these videos very accessible

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.240
in American Sign Language.

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.240
And soon, this app will be made available

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.240
to all the other 80 Sign Languages,

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:33.240
so that they can carry around with them a whole video library

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:36.240
in a mobile phone or an tablet.

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.240
That's remarkable.

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.240
But now some may ask,

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.240
since most deaf people can see,

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:46.240
why do they need videos with Sign Language?

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.240
Why can't they just read the publications?

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:53.240
While it's true that some deaf people read very well,

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:56.240
the vast majority of deaf people really struggle to understand

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.240
what they read and print it for.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:04.240
To give you an idea of the challenge that a person who is born deaf,

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.240
the challenge that he faces,

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.240
and learning to read well,

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:13.240
just imagine I put you in a glass soundproof booth.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.240
And I'm on the outside with a pencil and paper,

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:19.240
and I'm trying to teach you to read and write fluently

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:23.240
in Greek or Chinese.

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.240
How far are you going to get?

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:28.240
I would get nowhere.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:33.240
You see, learning a language really depends much on hearing it.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.240
Just think of how a child learns language.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.240
He hears it first for many years,

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.240
then he begins speaking it,

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.240
and once he's fluent at speaking the language,

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:46.240
then he learns that these little black squiggles on the page

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:51.240
represent the sounds and the words that he already knows.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.240
But for deaf people,

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.240
Sign Language used in our publications and at our meetings

00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:00.240
allows them to learn and to flourish spiritually,

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:03.240
to study, to have a meaningful ministry,

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:08.240
to participate in giving talks at meetings and conventions,

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.240
and to become good teachers of others.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.240
That's remarkable.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:18.240
But can Sign Language really teach what is found in the Bible?

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.240
Can it convey the understanding of the scriptures?

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:26.240
For example, what's taught or what's spoken of in the book of Revelation?

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:30.240
Sign languages are actually very rich languages,

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:34.240
and they excel at telling stories about people

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.240
and conveying emotions.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:40.240
Actually, the book of Revelation is very easy in Sign Language

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.240
because Revelation is so visual,

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:45.240
and so the Bible comes alive in Sign Language.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.240
Would you like to see some examples?

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.240
Oh, yes.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:54.539
For example, we have the woman who approached Jesus

00:26:54.539 --> 00:26:57.539
and touched the fringe of his garment,

00:26:57.539 --> 00:27:00.539
and then we see his reaction.

00:27:00.539 --> 00:27:07.230
The blind man who was healed

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:09.230
and regained his sight.

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:15.180
The beast of Revelation throwing down the harlot

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:20.500
and having a rafter in your own eye.

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:24.500
I could even understand some of those video presentations.

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.500
Of course, since I already know about the accounts,

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.500
but it's true, they're very powerful.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.500
Some in the congregations,

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:33.500
the hearing congregations may be wondering,

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:37.500
what can they do to assist in getting the good news

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.500
to deaf people everywhere?

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:44.500
If they meet a deaf person in the ministry or anywhere else,

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.500
they can always direct them to our website,

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:50.500
and there's a good possibility that we have a video there

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.500
in their Sign Language.

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.500
They can also direct the interest

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:57.500
to the local Sign Language congregation or group.

00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:59.500
One final question, Bobby.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:03.500
How do you personally feel about the progress

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:07.500
that you've seen in the Sign Language field worldwide?

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:12.500
I used to wonder how the good news was going to reach deaf people

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:17.500
in places like Russia, China, and India.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:21.500
But one by one, Jehovah has removed obstacles.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.500
And so, for example, today,

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:30.500
there are more than 3,500 Jehovah's Witnesses

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:33.500
who use Russian Sign Language.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:39.500
And worldwide, there are more than 24,000 deaf Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:42.500
We see all of this as a fulfillment of Bible prophecy

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:46.500
and as an evidence of Jehovah's blessing.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.500
Thank you very much, Bobby,

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:51.500
for giving us such insight into the world of the deaf

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:56.500
and also the way in which the good news is being carried to them.

00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:01.000
Our team found the encouraging example

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000
of Brother Jose Luis Ayala, who lives in Mexico City.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:13.000
He was born deaf and then became completely blind by the age of 29.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000
When he found the truth and wanted to study the Bible,

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000
our brothers lovingly made the effort to help him overcome these obstacles.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:32.490
I was devastated.

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:37.490
Being completely deaf and now blind was depressing.

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:40.490
Life became difficult.

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:42.490
I had to use a cane.

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:45.490
I couldn't get around like I used to.

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:48.490
I became afraid of walking on my own.

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:51.490
I was very sad.

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:59.299
Then I met the witnesses and they treated me well.

00:29:59.299 --> 00:30:02.299
Their conduct was different from the people at my old job

00:30:02.299 --> 00:30:05.299
who often mistreated me.

00:30:05.299 --> 00:30:09.299
As I learned more and more about the Bible, my life changed.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.680
The brothers took turns picking him up for the meetings

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:23.680
and then afterwards they taken back home.

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:26.680
Jose Luis really made lots of changes to clean up his conduct

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:29.680
and pleased Jehovah.

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:33.680
After several years, I approached the brothers about getting baptized.

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.680
They said, are you sure?

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.680
And I said, yes, I want to.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:42.680
So after going over the questions, I got baptized.

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.680
The congregation has a loving arrangement

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:47.680
where they assign brothers to help me prepare for the meetings.

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.680
Because obviously I can't see the videos or study material

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.680
like the watchtower.

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.680
But there are brothers who come and explain the information to me

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:57.680
so I can put everything into braille.

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:04.619
That way I can later give comments or deliver an assignment at the meeting.

00:31:04.619 --> 00:31:09.619
At the Kingdom Hall, sometimes I help with maintenance and with cleaning.

00:31:09.619 --> 00:31:13.900
I even help out in the magazine department.

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:16.900
Some in the congregation invite me to go preaching with them.

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:27.759
Three years ago, some brothers took me to a soccer field to play.

00:31:27.759 --> 00:31:34.730
The brothers were surprised at what I could do.

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:38.730
Afterwards, they gave me a lot of delicious food and drinks.

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:41.730
I ate and drank everything.

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:45.730
In 2011, I was appointed as an elder.

00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:49.730
And for two years, I've been serving as a regular pioneer.

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:55.220
The body of elders has seen that Jose Luis is very good

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:58.220
at giving encouragement to other publishers in the congregation.

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:03.539
We've actually assigned him to give talks to the assemblies.

00:32:03.539 --> 00:32:07.539
The audience really benefits from his way of presenting the information.

00:32:07.539 --> 00:32:12.200
Second Corinthians 2.10 says,

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:16.200
For when I am weak, then I am powerful.

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:20.200
The Spanish-speaking congregations often request him to go and give talks,

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.200
even though they don't know sign language.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:26.200
I use my notes in braille and give the talk in sign language,

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:30.200
while another brother interprets simultaneously using a microphone.

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:34.200
When I feel that 30 minutes have passed, I finish.

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:39.200
And instead of clapping, everybody applaud with their feet so I can feel it.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:43.200
They've told me that some in the audience begin to cry.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:48.200
It's not easy for me to deliver a talk, but when I realize this may encourage others,

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.200
the effort is worth it.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:57.200
We all struggle with certain experiences and difficulties in life.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:03.200
However, when you talk with Jose Luis and see the things he does,

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:08.200
and how he loves Jehovah, how he serves him with a complete heart,

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:14.200
his living example shows us there is no obstacle to great.

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:17.200
I think of what I was able to do before,

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:23.200
how I could enjoy seeing beautiful gardens before I became blind.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:27.200
I patiently wait for the future that I have learned about.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:33.200
I strive to be worthy to see with my own eyes what we hope for so much.

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:38.200
Even if I die, I know Jehovah can resurrect me.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.200
In the future, when I can see again,

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:46.200
I can imagine the tears when I see and hear all the brothers and sisters

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:50.200
who have been my friends, and to be able to greet them in person,

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:55.059
how nice it will be to give them a hug.

00:33:55.059 --> 00:34:00.059
It will make me so happy and thankful for the blessing of Jehovah.

00:34:00.059 --> 00:34:20.360
This is my hope.

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:27.360
Brother Ayala is grateful for the assistance from his congregation to grow spiritually.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:32.360
And we saw how he now enjoys giving spiritual gifts to others

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:38.360
as he personally looks ahead to God's promises for the deaf and blind.

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:44.360
Our faith in God's promises can be put to the test when we face a severe trial.

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:51.360
In this dramatization, a Christian family is devastated by natural disaster,

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:56.360
but finds a way to once again rejoice in the hope.

00:34:56.360 --> 00:35:02.019
What is there to look forward to?

00:35:02.019 --> 00:35:06.019
I've been thinking about this for a while now.

00:35:06.019 --> 00:35:18.070
Recently, a huge typhoon hit our area and inflicted severe damage.

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:35.190
Now, three generations of our family are temporarily living together in a small apartment.

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:39.190
Somehow, our family is keeping up our spiritual routine.

00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:50.340
But to be honest, our hearts aren't really in it.

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:57.659
We lost some close friends, our house, and the car.

00:35:57.659 --> 00:36:08.460
From that day on, it's like we can't think or feel anything.

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:25.960
We are just going through the motions.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:29.960
A brother from the disaster relief committee visited us.

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:44.340
He really listened to how he felt and gave us comfort from the Bible.

00:36:50.269 --> 00:37:01.070
That evening, my son and I discussed how we can help our family.

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:08.070
We found a scripture at Jeremiah, chapter 29, verse 11, which says,

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:14.070
For I will know the thoughts that I'm thinking toward you, declares Jehovah.

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:19.070
Thoughts of peace and not of calamity.

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:25.820
To give you a future and a hope.

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:30.820
Jehovah is looking at our future and our hope.

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:37.630
Not just what we are facing now.

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:42.230
We thought about Moses' example.

00:37:43.230 --> 00:38:06.659
Moses looked intently toward the payment of the reward.

00:38:06.659 --> 00:38:09.659
We finally saw what we should do.

00:38:09.659 --> 00:38:17.989
The next day, we all tried to envision the future paradise.

00:38:17.989 --> 00:38:49.130
We all felt a ray of hope into our hearts.

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:58.590
What is there to look forward to?

00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:02.590
I've been thinking about it for a while now.

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:06.590
When we dwell on the disaster, what we lost.

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:09.590
And just what we see before our eyes.

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:15.590
Then we can so easily be discouraged and lose joy.

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:20.590
But when we look toward the reward that Jehovah will give us.

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:24.590
And the future that Jehovah has in store for us.

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:27.590
Even in such hard times.

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:31.590
We can rejoice in the hope.

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:44.539
I know the answer.

00:39:44.539 --> 00:39:53.389
Yes, what I look forward to is our wonderful future.

00:39:53.389 --> 00:40:04.139
Dwelling on the loss was discouraging.

00:40:04.139 --> 00:40:09.139
Whereas visualizing their future hope restored the family's joy.

00:40:09.139 --> 00:40:14.139
All of us can benefit from keeping our hope before us.

00:40:14.139 --> 00:40:17.139
Family heads can imitate the example we've seen.

00:40:17.139 --> 00:40:23.139
And use family worship time to creatively imagine the future paradise.

00:40:23.139 --> 00:40:26.139
To prepare for life in the new world.

00:40:26.139 --> 00:40:32.139
Many have had the struggle to leave behind the desires and ways of this old world.

00:40:32.139 --> 00:40:38.139
Brother Hercules Pinto relates how he traded his desire for physical strength.

00:40:38.139 --> 00:40:42.139
For something far superior.

00:40:42.139 --> 00:40:45.139
I was born to be strong.

00:40:45.139 --> 00:40:47.139
I was raised that way.

00:40:47.139 --> 00:40:50.139
My father was a bodybuilder and a fighter.

00:40:50.139 --> 00:40:53.139
That's why he named me Hercules.

00:40:53.139 --> 00:40:59.139
I was raised in a seaside town in Rio de Janeiro, where my father had a gym.

00:40:59.139 --> 00:41:03.139
From early on, our life was not easy.

00:41:03.139 --> 00:41:06.139
My father was very aggressive.

00:41:06.139 --> 00:41:12.139
I felt frustrated and angry about the things that I saw happening at home.

00:41:12.139 --> 00:41:18.139
The only way I found to let out these feelings was with my fists, my fighting.

00:41:18.139 --> 00:41:23.639
I had a lot of anger inside of me.

00:41:23.639 --> 00:41:25.639
I felt worthless.

00:41:25.639 --> 00:41:30.820
I loved music.

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:32.820
Especially heavy metal.

00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:35.820
So I joined many different bands.

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:39.820
The fans' admiration felt really good.

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:46.789
When the show ended, however, I would feel empty.

00:41:47.789 --> 00:41:51.789
I kept asking myself, is this all there is to life?

00:41:51.789 --> 00:41:54.789
Is there a purpose in life?

00:41:54.789 --> 00:41:58.789
I believed in a creator, but I didn't trust any religions.

00:41:58.789 --> 00:42:01.789
One day, I was speaking to a guitarist.

00:42:01.789 --> 00:42:06.789
He was studying what Jehovah's Witnesses and a subject came up about the soul.

00:42:06.789 --> 00:42:10.789
He began to show me in the Bible what the soul really is.

00:42:10.789 --> 00:42:15.789
What he showed me really impressed me because it was irrefutable.

00:42:15.789 --> 00:42:17.789
I began to ask him lots of questions.

00:42:17.789 --> 00:42:23.170
In time, I myself started studying the Bible.

00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:27.170
A little while later, an opportunity arose for us to assign a contract.

00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:30.170
Something that would affect my whole life.

00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:39.079
But I wouldn't be able to serve Jehovah while in an environment that was immoral, dirty.

00:42:39.079 --> 00:42:46.760
It was then that I decided to leave the band.

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.760
But I needed to make big changes.

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:52.760
Leaving the band was just one of them.

00:42:52.760 --> 00:43:04.219
I still had a fight against immorality, my strong personality, my aggressive nature.

00:43:04.219 --> 00:43:12.230
The Colossians 310 assured me that it was possible to put on a new personality.

00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:18.230
With the help and support of my study conductor, I qualified to be baptized in 1989.

00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:21.230
And do not regret the decision I chose.

00:43:23.539 --> 00:43:29.539
Then, in 1992, I met a zealous and dedicated pioneer who became my wife.

00:43:29.539 --> 00:43:39.699
His love for Jehovah has helped him become a calmer, more loving and more caring person.

00:43:39.699 --> 00:43:43.699
I joined Adilza and began serving as a pioneer.

00:43:43.699 --> 00:43:47.699
In 1998, we were assigned to circuit work.

00:43:47.699 --> 00:43:52.699
And from then on, we began to visit congregations around the country.

00:43:52.699 --> 00:43:56.699
One of the things we enjoyed in this work is being among the brothers.

00:43:56.699 --> 00:44:07.699
I still love music, but I discover that I wouldn't have any purpose in life.

00:44:07.699 --> 00:44:15.699
If I weren't serving Jehovah wholeheartedly, I discover that true strength isn't physical.

00:44:15.699 --> 00:44:20.699
And that power doesn't come from fame or from being successful.

00:44:20.699 --> 00:44:30.309
True strength and power comes from serving Jehovah.

00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:37.309
Brother Pinto learned that true strength to change one's life comes from Jehovah.

00:44:37.309 --> 00:44:43.309
If a Bible student you're assisting is working to put on the new personality,

00:44:43.309 --> 00:44:50.309
watch Brother Pinto's story together and pray with your Bible student for the power beyond what is normal.

00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:57.590
Brother Pinto's spiritual interest started with his belief that there is a creator.

00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:04.590
Others too have found reason to believe in a creator before ever studying the Bible.

00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:12.590
In a new video series, we'll hear from former evolutionists who began to see evidence of a creator

00:45:12.590 --> 00:45:20.980
and were moved to learn more about him.

00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:23.980
My name is Yeroslav Dovenich.

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:31.980
I received my degree from the Biology Department of the Ujgorod State University and specialized in Zoology.

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:35.980
I love nature very much and want to protect it.

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:41.980
The evolutionary theory, in my opinion, quite reasonably argued that there is no creator,

00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:47.980
that everything was shaped by a series of random changes and combinations.

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:51.980
I was unable to prove this, but I believed it.

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:54.980
And that is why I was an evolutionist.

00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:59.769
I was a staunch evolutionist.

00:45:59.769 --> 00:46:05.769
While working in the Carpathian biosphere reserve and studying how ecological systems function,

00:46:05.769 --> 00:46:12.769
I studied nature through the lens of the evolution theory.

00:46:12.769 --> 00:46:19.769
When I studied nature through this lens, I began to notice things that contradicted the theory of evolution.

00:46:19.769 --> 00:46:25.769
I found things that couldn't have been formed by natural selection.

00:46:25.769 --> 00:46:32.980
As I started to wonder about this, whether there is a creator,

00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:37.980
I began to discover more facts contradicting the theory of evolution.

00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:42.980
Can anyone say that some computer programs appeared simply by chance?

00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:50.980
In contrast, evolutionists would like us to believe that DNA was formed by evolution to illustrate.

00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:57.980
Say you take some letter blocks, pour them onto the table,

00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:01.980
and the encyclopedia Britannica is formed.

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:08.980
There is an even smaller probability that DNA originated by evolution.

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:15.980
When I started to seriously consider the possibility that the world might have been created,

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:18.980
I began to meditate about the following.

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:26.900
I knew that religion explains that the world was created by God,

00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:31.900
so I decided to examine different religious teachings, including what the Bible says,

00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:37.070
about how God created the world.

00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:40.070
The Bible is very old, thousands of years old,

00:47:40.070 --> 00:47:45.070
and yet its contents are accurate and authentic to this day.

00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:48.070
And the Bible contains many prophecies.

00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:55.679
These are the foretelling of events.

00:47:55.679 --> 00:48:00.679
They were to occur in the distant future, sometimes many centuries in the future.

00:48:00.679 --> 00:48:07.679
History confirms that they have been fulfilled exactly as the Bible foretold.

00:48:07.679 --> 00:48:17.750
So these predictions must have been made by someone whose abilities are far greater than man's.

00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:20.750
This proves that the author of the Bible is not man,

00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:34.340
but someone who is far wiser and has abilities which man lacks.

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:36.340
My name is Raj Kalaria.

00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:39.340
I was brought up as a nominal Hindu.

00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:41.340
My parents were Hindus.

00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:43.340
I went along with them to respect them,

00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:49.650
but I didn't really understand completely what Hindu religion was about.

00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:52.650
I studied medical sciences.

00:48:52.650 --> 00:48:55.650
I have degrees in neurosciences and pathology.

00:48:55.650 --> 00:48:58.650
We were taught about evolution of life,

00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:01.650
and this was just part of the curriculum.

00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:05.650
At the time, there were no other options as it were.

00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:07.650
God did not come in the picture at all,

00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:10.650
or God creating the heavens and the earth as it were.

00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:13.989
Never came into the picture.

00:49:13.989 --> 00:49:17.989
The brain is an extremely complex organ,

00:49:17.989 --> 00:49:21.989
and brain is what we are, what I am, what you are.

00:49:21.989 --> 00:49:23.989
No brain, no life.

00:49:23.989 --> 00:49:25.989
It's as simple as that.

00:49:25.989 --> 00:49:33.269
We started looking at the nerve cells themselves in terms of their volume and the number,

00:49:33.269 --> 00:49:37.269
and it's phenomenal that in that small area of the brain,

00:49:37.269 --> 00:49:41.269
there are some 1.4 billion neurons.

00:49:41.269 --> 00:49:46.269
So the number of connections that make us synapses they make is phenomenal.

00:49:46.269 --> 00:49:48.269
Absolutely phenomenal.

00:49:48.269 --> 00:49:52.269
And so when you think about the complexity of all that,

00:49:52.269 --> 00:49:58.269
how is it possible that that is just by random chance?

00:49:58.269 --> 00:50:01.269
It has to be guided.

00:50:01.269 --> 00:50:03.269
Then when I was introduced to the Bible,

00:50:03.269 --> 00:50:07.269
one of the most beautiful things that struck me at the time

00:50:07.269 --> 00:50:11.269
was that there was one God coming from a Hindu background,

00:50:11.269 --> 00:50:14.269
the millions of Gods and the Trinity,

00:50:14.269 --> 00:50:19.269
which really all was mysterious and full of mythology as well.

00:50:19.269 --> 00:50:23.269
This idea of just one God, that really appealed to me.

00:50:23.269 --> 00:50:27.550
The Bible also gives us a piece of mind.

00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:31.550
It gives us a purpose in life.

00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:40.039
Did you notice that both men studied the complexity of living things

00:50:40.039 --> 00:50:42.039
from a different perspective,

00:50:42.039 --> 00:50:47.039
but found similar evidence for an intelligent designer?

00:50:47.039 --> 00:50:52.039
In the same way, our faith in Jehovah grows when we take time

00:50:52.039 --> 00:50:56.039
to observe his marvelous creation.

00:50:56.039 --> 00:50:59.039
Other things we observe can also build our faith.

00:50:59.039 --> 00:51:04.039
When young ones see brothers and sisters enjoying their sacred service,

00:51:04.039 --> 00:51:09.039
they often express their faith and talk about future spiritual goals.

00:51:09.039 --> 00:51:13.039
We went along with several groups of children to find out

00:51:13.039 --> 00:51:17.039
why they visited Bethel and what that visit taught them

00:51:17.039 --> 00:51:20.039
about the organization, and Jehovah.

00:51:20.039 --> 00:51:28.179
It took me three hours and forty-eight minutes.

00:51:28.179 --> 00:51:32.179
It took us two and a half to three hours to get here.

00:51:32.179 --> 00:51:36.179
I would rather go to Bethel than sit down and watch TV on my sofa.

00:51:37.179 --> 00:51:42.179
I've got to go to Bethel just like Caleb and Sophia.

00:51:42.179 --> 00:52:24.059
Once they go after that.

00:52:24.059 --> 00:52:27.059
Because we haven't been here for a long time,

00:52:27.059 --> 00:52:36.179
it's a great experience, and it's nice to see what they're doing here.

00:52:36.179 --> 00:52:40.179
You can find people who serve Jehovah and they're happy,

00:52:40.179 --> 00:52:43.179
and you can feel their concern for other people.

00:52:43.179 --> 00:52:51.050
I was off school, we got to go to Bethel,

00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:53.050
and we really glad that we got to go.

00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:57.940
I like the translation department,

00:52:57.940 --> 00:53:00.940
because that is where our publications and videos

00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:03.940
are translated into different languages.

00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:09.940
I saw the mini truck drivers at Bethel,

00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:15.940
and then we got to see how they make the books and my books.

00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:18.940
I learned that the paper in those barrels

00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:22.940
they actually stretch from here to France.

00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:27.940
I saw it when the paper was going down the machine,

00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:28.940
that was the paper.

00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:31.940
A little cart came onto the wheel,

00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:34.940
and then the thing pulled the paper down,

00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:36.940
and then the paper rolled inside,

00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:40.940
and then it went, and then the cart had the paper inside,

00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:42.940
and it rolled away.

00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:45.940
If we go to other places, they are dirty,

00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:49.940
but here it isn't, because this is the Jehovah's house.

00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:52.940
I really like the laundry.

00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:56.940
I saw these really big machines that keep on twirling,

00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:59.940
then clean clothes come out.

00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:02.940
Then they put more clothes into another machine.

00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:05.940
It twirls and twirls and it dries.

00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:07.940
I also like the iron.

00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:09.940
You just put the clothes there,

00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:11.940
and there it's a ready dry.

00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:18.940
On our tour, we made the news for friends.

00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:21.940
It hasn't had an amazing tour guide.

00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:25.940
He was good because he taught us more about Jehovah.

00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:30.940
I think that Bethel is really good,

00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:35.940
and it helps the people so much in the Jehovah.

00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:41.820
To other kids who haven't toured Bethel yet,

00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:43.820
they should try to come and visit,

00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:46.820
because they won't only enjoy the experience,

00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:51.820
they also learn many things about Jehovah's organization.

00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:56.420
I would tell kids that it didn't want to come to Bethel,

00:54:56.420 --> 00:55:01.420
that they're mixing out on something that is so great

00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:03.420
and loving from Jehovah.

00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:07.420
It showed me that Jehovah is a loving and caring God.

00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:33.230
Over for Bethel.

00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:35.230
If your circumstances allow,

00:55:35.230 --> 00:55:38.230
we're sure your family will benefit spiritually

00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:40.230
from visiting Bethel.

00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:43.230
It warms our hearts during these visits

00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:45.230
to see children who love Jehovah

00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:48.230
and show an appreciation for spiritual things

00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:51.230
at such a young age.

00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:55.230
Jehovah's people worldwide appreciate spiritual things.

00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:59.230
That's why we're eager to attend the 2016 convention

00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:03.230
with the theme Remain Loyal to Jehovah.

00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:07.230
The governing body wants you to see the exciting previews

00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:11.230
of the two video dramas that will enjoy at the convention.

00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:13.230
The first is a modern-day depiction

00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:17.230
that draws from the life experiences of Jehovah.

00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:25.349
So, Dad, how many stars are there?

00:56:25.349 --> 00:56:31.639
You're lifting in the forehead and the stone sank

00:56:31.639 --> 00:56:33.639
at the his forehead.

00:56:33.639 --> 00:56:36.530
It's okay with this one.

00:56:36.530 --> 00:56:37.530
Nice, perfect.

00:56:37.530 --> 00:56:46.699
It looks like we have to let some people go

00:56:46.699 --> 00:56:49.699
and your name is on the list.

00:56:49.699 --> 00:56:50.699
It's just a new already thing.

00:56:50.699 --> 00:56:52.699
You just don't got it.

00:56:52.699 --> 00:56:54.699
I've been praying and looking for a job

00:56:54.699 --> 00:56:57.699
that will fit my schedule and nothing's happening.

00:56:57.699 --> 00:56:58.699
Nine a.m. Friday.

00:56:58.699 --> 00:56:59.699
What was that about?

00:56:59.699 --> 00:57:01.699
The doctor's office wants me to come in Friday.

00:57:01.699 --> 00:57:03.699
The first line I think is best to treat this

00:57:03.699 --> 00:57:05.699
as aggressively as possible.

00:57:05.699 --> 00:57:10.360
My recommendation is surgery.

00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:12.360
Everything happens for a reason.

00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:13.360
Prayer?

00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:15.360
There's nobody listening.

00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:17.360
What's your future?

00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:18.360
You don't have any money.

00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:19.360
You're drowning in debt.

00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:20.360
You don't even have a job.

00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:21.360
Everything I've done.

00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:23.360
I've done for my family's spirituality.

00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:24.360
Spirituality bill.

00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:25.360
That's why you don't-

00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:26.360
Spirituality.

00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:27.360
Where's the teen?

00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:30.989
Where's the one flesh?

00:57:30.989 --> 00:57:33.989
I can't provide for my family.

00:57:33.989 --> 00:57:34.989
At all.

00:57:34.989 --> 00:57:39.300
I wake up sick every morning, useless,

00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:41.300
wanting to die.

00:57:41.300 --> 00:58:00.019
And you will wipe out every tear from their eyes.

00:58:00.019 --> 00:58:02.019
And death will be no more.

00:58:02.019 --> 00:58:09.619
Neither morning nor outcry.

00:58:09.619 --> 00:58:18.119
Nor pain me anymore.

00:58:18.119 --> 00:58:20.119
The former things have passed away.

00:58:20.119 --> 00:58:26.030
What are we two talking about?

00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:41.460
Hope.

00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:44.460
Imagine the valuable lessons will gain

00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:47.460
when we see the full video.

00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:50.460
The second drama, prepared for the convention,

00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:53.460
follows the biblical account of King Hezekiah

00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:57.460
and how he courageously put his trust in Jehovah.

00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:25.610
Whiskeyed.

00:59:25.610 --> 00:59:28.610
I disguised myself as one of the Assyrian soldiers.

00:59:28.610 --> 00:59:30.610
They finally broke through the wall.

00:59:30.610 --> 00:59:33.610
And they singled out the leading man of the city

00:59:33.610 --> 00:59:34.610
and they skinned them alive.

00:59:34.610 --> 00:59:36.610
The Assyrians will come for us.

00:59:36.610 --> 00:59:39.610
It's wise to take practical measures.

00:59:39.610 --> 00:59:41.610
If we paid the tribute, we wouldn't need a surrender

00:59:41.610 --> 00:59:43.610
and we wouldn't need to fight.

00:59:43.610 --> 00:59:44.610
What have you done?

00:59:44.610 --> 00:59:56.530
Our children will die!

00:59:56.530 --> 00:59:58.530
We need not fear the King of Assyrian

00:59:58.530 --> 01:00:00.530
all the multitude that are with him.

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:02.530
For there are more with us than there are with him.

01:00:02.530 --> 01:00:04.530
With him is the arm of flesh.

01:00:04.530 --> 01:00:07.530
But with us is our God Jehovah to help us

01:00:07.530 --> 01:00:09.530
and to fight our battles.

01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:31.380
Trust in Jehovah, Hezekiah.

01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:34.380
He never disappoints those who are loyal to him.

01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:46.949
We have good things just ahead of us

01:00:46.949 --> 01:00:49.949
at this year's convention.

01:00:49.949 --> 01:00:52.949
We'll want to make plans to attend all three days

01:00:52.949 --> 01:00:54.949
to take in the spiritual food

01:00:54.949 --> 01:00:59.949
and enjoy the association with our brothers.

01:00:59.949 --> 01:01:01.949
The faithful and discreet slave

01:01:01.949 --> 01:01:04.949
lovingly keeps providing what we need

01:01:04.949 --> 01:01:08.949
to keep pace with Jehovah's advancing organization.

01:01:08.949 --> 01:01:11.949
And so this month's music video

01:01:11.949 --> 01:01:15.949
warmly encourages us to keep the pace.

01:01:15.949 --> 01:01:27.860
Ten of this world is changing.

01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:31.860
I can't live in the past.

01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:36.860
Please help me to keep running

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:40.860
because we're moving fast.

01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:44.860
When we face opposition

01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:47.860
and all the doors are closed

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:54.329
let's follow new direction there

01:01:54.329 --> 01:01:57.329
and find a well-disposed.

01:01:57.329 --> 01:02:00.329
Let's keep the pace.

01:02:00.329 --> 01:02:04.329
You can take my hand, let's win the race.

01:02:04.329 --> 01:02:08.329
Don't let go to the end, get what it takes

01:02:08.329 --> 01:02:12.329
and all you need is to keep the pace.

01:02:12.329 --> 01:02:20.230
I have such good intentions

01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:24.230
at the start of each new day.

01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:28.230
But something always happens

01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:36.769
and there is a challenge

01:02:36.769 --> 01:02:41.179
facing out of control

01:02:41.179 --> 01:02:46.579
gives to help us manage

01:02:46.579 --> 01:02:50.579
to keep us on the road.

01:02:50.579 --> 01:02:53.579
Let's keep the pace.

01:02:53.579 --> 01:02:57.579
You can take my hand, let's win the race.

01:02:57.579 --> 01:03:00.579
Don't let go to the end, get what it takes

01:03:00.579 --> 01:03:15.190
and all you need for to see.

01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:18.500
Blessings flow.

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:22.500
We go the extra mile.

01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:28.409
Adjust to change.

01:03:28.409 --> 01:03:36.099
A smile is clear.

01:03:36.099 --> 01:03:44.210
You see paradise with no more tears.

01:03:44.210 --> 01:03:48.210
I'm so glad that I try to keep the pace.

01:03:48.210 --> 01:03:54.159
You can take my hand, let's win the race.

01:03:54.159 --> 01:03:57.159
Don't let go to the end, get what it takes

01:03:57.159 --> 01:04:13.090
and all you need to see.

01:04:13.090 --> 01:04:25.340
You can take my hand, let's win the race.

01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:27.340
Don't let go to the end, get what it takes

01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:30.340
and all you need for to see.

01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:33.340
Young or old, we're assured at Hebrews 6-10

01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:36.340
that God is not unrighteous

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:39.340
so as to forget our work

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:41.340
assist fellow believers

01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:44.340
and keep looking ahead with faith.

01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:48.340
We are assured of Jehovah's rich blessing.

01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:51.340
You may have noticed that the original soundtracks

01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:53.340
of our music videos have been added

01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:57.340
to the audio category of JW Broadcasting.

01:04:57.340 --> 01:05:02.340
You can also download them to the JW Library app.

01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:05.340
Once the files have been downloaded to your device,

01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:09.340
you'll have two additional options for playing your songs.

01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:11.340
You can press the play all button

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:16.340
or play tracks randomly by pressing the shuffle button.

01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:19.340
Downloading the files to the JW Library app

01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:21.340
lets you play them again and again

01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:26.340
at no additional download or streaming costs to the organization.

01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:29.340
You can enjoy, keep the pace

01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:34.340
and our other songs as often as you like.

01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:39.340
We conclude with an encouraging visit to Poland

01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:43.340
where our brothers are also keeping the pace.

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:46.340
More than 120,000 publishers

01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:51.340
are busy taking the good news to over 38 million people.

01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:53.340
They're preaching and growing cities

01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:55.340
along mountain ranges

01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:58.340
and through the beautiful countryside.

01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:00.340
The first class of the school

01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:02.340
for Kingdom of Angelizers

01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:06.340
was held in Warsaw in March 2015.

01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:08.340
There have been several classes since

01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:10.340
with eager students graduating

01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:13.340
and ready to work in the field.

01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:16.340
Many older ones remember the 40-year ban

01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:18.340
on our work in Poland

01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:22.340
that ended with legal recognition in 1989.

01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:24.340
Years later,

01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:26.340
spiritual food is openly shared

01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:29.340
in special metropolitan witnessing.

01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:33.340
Our brothers and sisters diligently bear thorough witness.

01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:36.340
They're happy to support Kingdom interests

01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:38.340
to worship together

01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:42.340
and to enjoy each other's association.

01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:45.340
They send you their greetings.

01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:47.340
We send our love and return

01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:52.340
and pray for Jehovah's continued blessing on them.

01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:55.340
Thank you for joining us.

01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:58.340
From Brooklyn, New York,

01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:01.340
this is JW Broadcasting.
