WEBVTT

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.849
Welcome, brothers and sisters. It's a pleasure to be with you.

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:13.410
In this update, we're going to share a few brief reports. Then we'll watch a very encouraging

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.210
video interview. I'm sure you'll find it to face strengthening.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:26.649
First here are the updates. In late April, brother Mark Sanderson traveled to Poland. A special

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:31.850
meeting was held at the assembly hall in Warsaw to encourage the brothers and sisters

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:42.090
affected by the ongoing war in Ukraine. Over 250,000 from Poland, Ukraine and the Donbass

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.570
region tied in for the program. One circuit overseer in the Donbass region wrote,

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:58.570
it was a wonderful program and food at the proper time. It brings tears of joy to see

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:05.769
how Jehovah loves us. After the program, brother Sanderson and three branch committee members

00:01:05.769 --> 00:01:17.170
traveled 2,500 kilometers or 1,550 miles throughout Poland to visit refugees and hardworking

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:26.489
volunteers at assembly halls, kingdom halls and border crossings. Truly, this visit was

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:33.730
a warm expression of Jehovah's love for his people. We sincerely thank all of you for

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:43.090
your prayers and generous donations that make the relief work possible. On May 4, 71 year

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:50.090
old sister Valentina Barbara Noscaya was finally released from prison. She was in prison

00:01:50.090 --> 00:02:02.159
for well over a year. What a warm reception she received. We rejoice with you sister Valentina,

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:10.840
but we've not forgotten that your son Roman is still in prison for his faith. We keep you

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:19.560
both in our prayers. On May 24, brother Dennis Christensen was released from prison in Russia.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:27.199
He spent five years in various detention facilities. After his release, he was immediately

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:35.439
deported. He and his wife Irina are now safe in Denmark as we can see in the following video.

00:02:36.439 --> 00:03:03.860
Today is a happy day. A happy day because I at least got free from the prison and I came home

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:11.300
to Copenhagen in Denmark where I can again be together with my friends and my beloved family.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:18.939
I'm also looking forward to that I can live a more normal family life with my beloved wife Irina.

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:26.939
I'm very glad and I appreciate all that that all the brothers and sisters has done for me in

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:37.659
these five years. All these thoughts, all these letters, all these prayers, all the drawings and

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:44.419
other gifts that I got from the children has encouraged me a lot. And through all these,

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:51.659
I have always felt that I was not alone. That Jehovah's Hand was never too short,

00:03:51.659 --> 00:04:00.900
too safe, too support and to help. Many people ask me, oh Dennis, at the prison time crossed

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:10.419
you, did they break you? No way, never ever. And you know what, I am more determined than ever to

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:16.259
be faithful to Jehovah, more determined to preach the good news, to help other brothers and sisters

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:23.060
and other people to gain our goals. The goal is to turn a life in paradise where we all have the

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:30.660
opportunity to serve and preach Jehovah forever. So no, I'm not broken, no, I'm not crossed,

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:39.620
I'm still here, I'm back. We rejoice with you Dennis and Irina, your faith and integrity have

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:46.579
strengthened all of us. We're overjoyed to have you back. Although we're happy about these

00:04:46.579 --> 00:04:54.579
developments, we keep in mind that around the world, over 150 of our brothers and sisters

00:04:54.579 --> 00:05:02.500
are in prison for their faith. In Russia, four brothers are serving eight-year prison sentences,

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:09.139
and one sister is serving a six-year sentence. He was 13-3, he says,

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:17.540
keep in mind those in prison as though you were imprisoned with them.

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:26.579
How can we keep our prison brothers and sisters in mind? If we live close by, there may be

00:05:26.579 --> 00:05:34.500
practical things we can do to assist, but all of us can pray for them and their family members

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:43.060
every day. We also can meditate on their fine example. When we see these brothers and sisters

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:52.100
endure unjust imprisonment and do so with joy, we're encouraged to imitate their faith. We're

00:05:52.100 --> 00:06:01.220
motivated to endure our own current trials, and we're sure that we can endure future trials

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:10.259
with joy. In the following video interview, two brothers from Russia share how they faithfully

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:20.740
and joyfully endured a four-year prison sentence. My criminal prosecution began on July 22,

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:28.259
2018. It was a Sunday, a meeting wasn't progress. After the search had finished,

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:36.660
they told me that I had to go with them. I opened the door because FSB officers were

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:43.620
persistently raining the doorbell. Then after a few seconds came the sound of smashing glass.

00:06:44.579 --> 00:06:48.740
They'd smash the balcony, then broken down the door in the balcony,

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:55.699
and when my wife had tried to tell them the door was already open so that they wouldn't smash

00:06:55.699 --> 00:07:03.930
anything, pieces of glass cut her forehead and a vein was the cut of vein in her hand.

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:12.069
And then the officers approached me and showed me the search warrant, and I said to them,

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:20.649
I'm not interested in the warrant. Call an ambulance. We wanted to send my wife to the hospital,

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:31.000
but she decided to stay with me. The search continued for five hours, so they locked me up.

00:07:31.959 --> 00:07:36.360
Two days later there was a court hearing it which they ruled that placed me under arrest

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:49.639
and sent me to pretrial detention center. The most difficult part of all the persecution

00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:57.560
was being in the pressure cell. When I entered or rather when the workers and guards of the detention

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:02.519
center pushed me in there, the first thing I heard was the word get down on your knees,

00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:12.199
but I told them that the only person I went down on my knees for was God. Then they started shouting,

00:08:12.839 --> 00:08:19.800
ridiculing me, though I didn't understand what they were asking of me or what they wanted.

00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:27.160
I only found out after several hours when they told me directly that I had to give them

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:35.000
information about two brothers who had been detained in a neighboring town. They laid out instruments

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.399
of torture in front of me and said that I wouldn't be able to stand it or hold out.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:50.360
So I'd better agree to recuperate with them. I didn't give any evidence against those brothers

00:08:50.519 --> 00:08:59.080
because I knew it would make their situation worse. I faced my own hardships when I was put into

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:07.610
pretrial detention. Every day from morning to night they have the radio on, the radio is very

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:13.769
loud in the cells, people are talking, and after several months in the detention center they put

00:09:13.769 --> 00:09:20.649
me into a solitary confinement cell. I was worried about who I would preach to if I had to spend the whole

00:09:20.649 --> 00:09:36.059
period there. That evening I prayed very hard. A few days later a man was placed in the cell

00:09:36.059 --> 00:09:45.899
next to mine. He had been in prison for 13 years. In the last year he had begun to think deeply

00:09:45.899 --> 00:09:52.139
about spiritual subjects and even started to read the Bible. We often talk to him about spiritual

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:58.860
matters every day, several hours. I sang kingdom songs to him and read scriptures that the

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:05.259
brothers and sisters had sent me in letters. One of those who were in the pressure cell

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:13.500
collaborated with the administration and physically he was very strong. Like a mountain of muscle

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:21.500
the thought came to me that what was in front of me was actually 80% water.

00:10:23.899 --> 00:10:31.500
I don't know, but maybe at that moment I even smiled. But that thought which undoubtedly

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.899
Jehovah gave me at that moment changed my view of those people.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:44.059
There was a cell next to mine that was also a solitary confinement cell and it was often empty.

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:52.460
Almost every day I prayed to Jehovah that my friend and brother Vadim would be

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:58.220
transferred to that cell. When Vadim found out that I was making requests like that to Jehovah

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:05.820
he said, this is okay, you're too naive. You and I in prison terms are partners in crime.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:11.899
So by law we wouldn't be allowed to be in adjacent cells. I said, let's just wait and see.

00:11:13.179 --> 00:11:16.860
I think the evening someone came into my cell and said,

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:23.179
lethuk, you're being transferred and they took me out to a different block, took me into a cell

00:11:23.179 --> 00:11:29.580
and I heard Sergei's voice in the next cell through the wall saying, Vadim is that you? I said,

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:35.740
yes it's me and he said, oh that's wonderful I begged Jehovah for you and when I heard that he

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:41.980
backed for me to be moved to the next cell I was quite angry because my return visits had been messed

00:11:42.139 --> 00:11:48.220
up. We had agreed that I would tell them a Bible story but then I realized why Jehovah had

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:54.299
arranged things in that way because we both needed emotional support from each other and we were

00:11:54.299 --> 00:12:00.139
together for two weeks. We read and discussed the text for each day and we shared thoughts from

00:12:00.139 --> 00:12:13.690
letters. There was a situation when I was depressed for several days when I was in the solitary confinement

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:19.370
then I received a new package of letters. I usually sorted them into those I would read first

00:12:19.929 --> 00:12:24.009
and those I would read later. There was one letter that I didn't want to read at all

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:31.529
so I put it in a separate pile for the future but then something inside said to me, no you need

00:12:31.529 --> 00:12:37.690
to read that letter and that letter was the answer to my prayer. The main theme of this letter

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:47.210
is how Satan uses one of his most effective weapons discouragement. I started applying the

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:53.049
council on that subject straight away and that helped me to come out of that state of mind

00:12:53.049 --> 00:13:00.659
and get rid of negative thoughts. Everywhere I was having good discussions with those in the

00:13:00.659 --> 00:13:08.659
neighboring cells. We were able to talk through the walls and I kept asking myself why I was constantly

00:13:08.659 --> 00:13:17.460
being moved around. Couldn't I just be left in one cell and at that moment I received a letter

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:22.580
in which a sister wrote the phrase. If you move from one cell to another,

00:13:23.299 --> 00:13:28.100
view it as being assigned with a new territory as you have completed the previous one.

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:35.539
I had such a reaction to that I said that's the answer. In their letters brothers and sisters

00:13:35.539 --> 00:13:44.899
from all over the world sent various illustrations, pictures, photographs. Someone sent this portrait

00:13:44.899 --> 00:13:53.139
for example it's my wife Natasha and I sitting in Jehovah's hands. All the spiritual food we got

00:13:53.139 --> 00:13:59.700
was in the letters to the extent that even the entire three-day convention was written out

00:13:59.779 --> 00:14:06.580
and sent to us in letters. And when I was reading the letters it was as though I wasn't there in the

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:13.379
detention center or the prison colony. I was with my friends as in being with them as guests

00:14:13.379 --> 00:14:19.220
when I was reading their letters so it was as though for half of the three and a half year sentence

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:26.580
I wasn't really there in the detention center or the prison colony. Each day throughout the entire

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:34.340
time of my imprisonment each morning I would ask Jehovah for godly peace or a sense of calm.

00:14:36.019 --> 00:14:43.620
And in circumstances like that words just cannot express how much you feel that calmness.

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:50.500
It is totally opposite to the circumstances you're in the company that surrounds you

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:58.899
or even your state of health. But to have peace of heart that's a real sense of calm as well as

00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:04.580
that I felt enormous support from the brothers and Jehovah's love during the court proceedings

00:15:06.019 --> 00:15:11.059
because there were always a large number of brothers and sisters at the court hearings.

00:15:14.259 --> 00:15:19.059
For the first few times when brothers and sisters came for the hearings on the measures of

00:15:19.139 --> 00:15:25.700
restriction the FSB would write down their names and then hand them orders to appear for interrogation.

00:15:27.379 --> 00:15:33.299
Then we would arrive for the next hearing and see the same brothers and sisters there

00:15:33.299 --> 00:15:39.299
and that really strengthened us. We saw that they were not afraid and that they sincerely

00:15:39.299 --> 00:15:52.139
wanted to support us and that was how it was right to the end. In one letter I received the outline

00:15:52.299 --> 00:16:02.460
for the memorial and I was very eager to give the talk just a few days later while exercising in the

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:08.379
prison yard. I started speaking with an inmate who was interested in the Bible. On the day before

00:16:08.379 --> 00:16:15.899
the memorial we were talking again and I said to him, did you know that tomorrow a celebration

00:16:15.899 --> 00:16:21.899
will be taking place all over the world? I explained to him what the celebration was,

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:27.019
how it was going to be held and that there will be a talk given and he said to me,

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:34.700
sir gay, do you have this talk? I said, yeah, I do. And so we agreed that the next day

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:44.139
on the day of the memorial I would give the talk. And so the day came. It was already 10 o'clock

00:16:44.139 --> 00:16:50.139
in the evening and the man was still busy with something. I prayed to Jehovah, what shall I do?

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:58.299
And then at 10.30 he shouts to me, sir gay, you can begin. We're all listening to you carefully

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:06.779
and that was how I began my presentation. Literally a few minutes pass and I hear footsteps

00:17:06.779 --> 00:17:13.660
in the corridor. The inspector comes to my door and looks through the spy hole on the cell door.

00:17:16.539 --> 00:17:22.940
I ask him, did something happen? He says, nothing, nothing. Continue reading, read.

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:29.339
I said, oh Jehovah, thank you so much and so I continued with the talk.

00:17:38.279 --> 00:17:43.960
I knew that we would probably be separated and that we could be assigned to separate sections

00:17:45.079 --> 00:17:52.279
so we wouldn't have the opportunity to support each other and conduct meetings which was really

00:17:52.279 --> 00:18:00.119
important to me. He explained his position that he needed to look after me as I was disabled

00:18:00.599 --> 00:18:09.240
and the administration made the concession. That was such a support, spiritually, emotionally and physically.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:34.630
We conducted congregation meetings together. Each week, at the same time, we held the congregation meetings.

00:18:35.589 --> 00:18:44.630
We had a certain program, but we used the available material that came to us in a huge way.

00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:02.630
Sometimes others would join us to listen to the talk.

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:08.630
I said, don't worry, we will meet each other at the same time.

00:19:13.829 --> 00:19:22.069
Vadim and I always prayed in full view of everyone. That was in the dining hall before meetings,

00:19:22.069 --> 00:19:32.490
after meetings and before going to bed. It was a witness to the others and people took note of it.

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:38.250
And because of that, we were respected for being people of faith.

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:52.569
I always knew that I had to make special use of this time and I prayed. The whole time I said a

00:19:52.569 --> 00:20:00.730
particular prayer to Jehovah. I said to him, Jehovah, you are the potter. I am the clay, so please mold me.

00:20:02.819 --> 00:20:09.220
So in the situations that I found myself in throughout those three and a half years, both the good

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:15.940
and the bad ones were always an opportunity to be molded. In going through all of those trials,

00:20:16.579 --> 00:20:24.740
I saw and felt that my relationship with Jehovah was getting stronger, stronger and more trusting.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:29.859
That was because, in those circumstances, there was a lot of time for prayer.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:38.420
And I saw very often how Jehovah answers specific prayers that really drew me closer to Jehovah.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:46.339
Throughout the whole period of persecution, I was strengthened by the words of Jeremiah 4810.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:52.900
First is the one who carries out the mission of Jehovah neglectfully. When I found myself in such

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:59.299
hard and difficult circumstances, I understood that I had the responsibility to give a witness to

00:20:59.299 --> 00:21:06.500
Jehovah's name by my conduct and deeds. Another thing that always strengthened me throughout the whole

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:15.299
time was the scripture at Isaiah 57, verse 15, and the thought that Jehovah lives with those who are

00:21:15.299 --> 00:21:23.799
crushed and who are in a bad place emotionally. At such times, I was able to imagine Jehovah sitting

00:21:23.799 --> 00:21:31.480
right next to me and stroking my shoulder and reassuring me that everything will be fine. I am with

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:40.279
you. I have seen that all the trials that had been allowed, despite their difficulty, Jehovah has

00:21:40.279 --> 00:22:12.180
turned them all into blessings. What a touching interview. Did you notice what helped our

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:20.339
brothers to joyfully endure their unjust imprisonment? They mentioned how vital it was to keep a good

00:22:20.339 --> 00:22:29.859
routine of Bible reading, prayer, and meetings, even though they were in prison. They witnessed

00:22:29.859 --> 00:22:37.460
others at every opportunity, and they saw Jehovah's love and care in very personal ways.

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:45.380
We can do the same things to strengthen our faith and maintain our joy. Speaking of joy,

00:22:46.339 --> 00:22:53.940
what a blessing it has been for us to return to in-person meetings. It takes some effort

00:22:53.940 --> 00:23:02.259
to attend, but seeing our brothers and sisters hearing their laughter, joining with them in song

00:23:02.259 --> 00:23:11.940
and prayer makes the effort so worthwhile. It's another gift from Jehovah to help us joyfully

00:23:12.019 --> 00:23:20.180
endure. So whatever trials you're dealing with, don't lose your joy in serving Jehovah.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:29.380
As Nehemiah 10 says, do not feel sad for the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.

00:23:30.579 --> 00:23:38.579
Brothers and sisters, we appreciate you and the joy that you maintain despite the many challenges

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:47.619
we face. It makes us love you all the more. From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:23:47.619 --> 00:23:56.740
this is J.W. Broadcasting.
