00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:07.610
Animals fascinate us.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:18.289
We marvel at their speed, their agility, and their strength.

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:28.980
Their beauty and behavior are a pleasure to watch.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.980
Like us, they play.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:37.270
Some even dance.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:48.049
They are industrious.

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:51.049
A beaver dam can extend hundreds of meters.

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:55.049
Some can even be seen from space.

00:00:55.049 --> 00:01:04.120
When we observe animals, we learn more about the creator.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.120
Their instinctive wisdom reveals his wisdom.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:15.200
He is caring and generous.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.200
And he is a happy God.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:25.409
Animals fascinate us because we are made in God's image.

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.200
We enjoy what he enjoys.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.200
Especially our Earth and its amazing animals.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.200
They are his gift to us.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.200
Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.200
And let them have in subjection the fish of the sea

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.200
and the flying creatures of the heavens and the domestic animals and all the Earth.
