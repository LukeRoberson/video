00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:11.720
This new publication, Love People Make Disciples, is being made available in both print and digital formats in over 400 languages.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:17.719
How is the brochure designed to help us show love for people we meet?

00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:30.420
Unlike the tools we've used in the past, this new brochure does not give us expressions to memorize, nor does it put the emphasis on leaving literature.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:37.420
Rather, it features 12 lessons that focus on qualities we need to cultivate to make disciples.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:47.420
All the lessons are based on Bible accounts, in which Jesus or another 1st century evangelizer displayed a specific quality in the ministry.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:55.420
The lessons will help us see how we can imitate the qualities they demonstrated as we make disciples.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:14.099
Each lesson contains a video that brings the account to life. A woman of Samaria came to draw water.

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:15.099
Give me a drink.

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:24.719
By cultivating an interest in people, we can talk about things that are on their minds.

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.189
What truths might we share with people once a conversation is started?

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:37.189
Appendix A highlights basic Bible truths that we love to teach.

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:43.189
Make it your goal to learn these basic truths and the scriptures that support them.

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:49.189
If you do, you will be more effective in starting conversations and in making disciples.

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:55.189
For example, a conversation can be started by asking a simple question, such as,

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.189
Have you heard that God will soon end all suffering?

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:05.189
Or, did you know that the earth's environment will be restored?

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:14.449
Sharing a simple truth at the right time is powerful.

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:17.449
Jesus said his sheep would listen to his voice.

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:25.449
In other words, rightly disposed ones will recognize the truth when they hear it expressed simply.

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:30.449
Appendix B helps us to determine whether to continue a conversation.

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:38.449
Appendix C provides practical suggestions on how to conduct Bible studies and enjoy life forever.

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:42.449
What if you don't feel comfortable starting conversations?

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:43.449
Don't worry.

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:54.449
Beginning in January 2024, the apply yourself portion of each midweek meeting will help us to practice the points we are learning in this new brochure.

00:02:54.449 --> 00:03:00.449
The meeting will no longer focus on presenting a predetermined topic in scripture.

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:07.449
Rather, students will select topics for their assignments that they know are on the minds of those in their community.

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:27.830
By means of realistic demonstrations, audience discussions, and talks, our meetings will assist us to develop skills that will help us start conversations naturally and adapt to each person's concerns and needs.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:38.300
By focusing on people, we will become more comfortable and more effective as we make disciples.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:48.300
As you consider each lesson, think carefully about how you can demonstrate the highlighted qualities when conversing with people in your community.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.300
Ask yourself, what are their concerns and needs?

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.300
As you go about your activities, be observant.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.300
Work for appropriate opportunities to help people in practical ways.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.300
Acts of kindness can open the door to share kingdom truth.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.300
Show that you care by listening to others when they express themselves.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.300
Share a simple truth at the right time.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:26.300
Remember, our goal is not to memorize the presentation, but to demonstrate Christ's like love to everyone we meet.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:36.730
This will require patience, perseverance, and commitment.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:44.170
No matter where we live, or under what circumstances we are preaching,

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:49.170
simply showing love will help us to find joy in our ministry.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:05:02.009
More than any specific technique, actively expressing our love for others will help us make disciples.
