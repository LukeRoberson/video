00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:10.980
So my mother was born in the country of Bulgaria in 1922 and in the early 50s my family

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.660
emigrated from Germany to the United States.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.500
We settled in New York City and it was there that my mother learned the truth.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.699
That's the first time I opened a Bible.

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:32.140
I've ended up in Revelation chapter 21 but what hit me was the point that they will

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.259
might be sickness, sorrow and death anymore.

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:43.340
Anyone that comes into the truth wants to share that with their family.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:55.420
I had the desire to tell them the truth how they can get free from oppression and sickness

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.380
and death.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:04.780
So she very much saw the deed and desired to have literature in the Bulgarian language.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.700
She was able to ask the brothers in Brooklyn specifically offering could she translate

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.819
some literature in Bulgaria.

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:21.769
The brothers approved her to do that starting out with some of the tracks.

00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:27.769
So Bulgaria was behind the Iron Curtain, a communist country, literature about God and the

00:01:27.769 --> 00:01:35.209
Bible is not acceptable and banned and so you can't just mail it.

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:40.329
So as literature became available people have to take it in.

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:45.290
My family was one of those families that volunteered to do that.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.329
We traveled into Bulgaria by train.

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.890
We have a lot of luggage because every time we will go to Bulgaria we stay two and a half

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:54.890
months.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.650
That was the summer vacation.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:06.290
In that luggage in various places we put literature.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:14.330
Getting into a country with banned literature is not without its problems or dangers.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.009
They knew that we had some literature and that was the track.

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:23.770
My mother realized that we were going to be searched.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:32.289
We had the ability then to take the literature out of each luggage that we had hidden it

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:36.090
and to put it into one small briefcase.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:44.889
And what we couldn't as unfolded tracks, we put around our arm with our overcoats over

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:45.889
it.

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:53.689
I was only worried about how I can hide that literature so he cannot find it because

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:58.930
he will find it than really the consequences.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.849
So as the guards would search through the luggage they rifle through it.

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.490
They don't straighten anything out.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:10.250
So my mother quickly thought and asked them, can I now go over there and straighten out

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.330
what you've messed up?

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.689
And they said, okay.

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:25.129
And I took my tracks which I had around my hand and I put it in the already checked bag

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:27.050
over there.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.729
One of the guards gets to the point that it's my little briefcase.

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:42.469
He says, this is so small, nothing could be in here and he just takes it over there.

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:48.949
The man who was looking up was getting very nervous because he knew we had something

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:54.900
but he was not able to find it.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.460
So on one trip years later my mother was on her own.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.020
The officials at the border of Bulgaria found the literature.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.259
They arrested her.

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:08.900
They put her in prison.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.939
They interrogated her for two weeks or more every day.

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:21.740
And in time the Bulgarian government had changed their mind and had decided that as a foreign

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:27.620
national they would just expel her from the country.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:34.139
To this day my mother continues her spiritual routine of worshiping Jehovah, being at the

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:40.420
meetings, preparing for the meetings, reading her Bible and zealously sharing the truth

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.180
with others.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:54.660
It helps me practically every minute in my life and I want to use my last energy to

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.259
make this world know.
