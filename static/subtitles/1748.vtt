00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:07.250
We were brought up in a small town in Saskatchewan. It was friendly. I

00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:12.009
Don't think they moved to other places. They stayed right there

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:21.010
One time our father said why do you have to go so far as India? Why can't you preach in Canada?

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.100
That was very strict when we were out playing and he came out and called us we had to come immediately

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:36.340
It was strict. Don't question. It's do what you're doing. Do what you're talking and that's right

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.840
strict

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.240
My father was the one that was interested but he never came in the truth

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.359
He enjoyed having witnesses come to our home

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:51.719
But he never ever thought of himself as being one or Jehovah's Witnesses

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.520
Coming in the truth, I think

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.320
changed our life and we had a different purpose

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:08.920
So that's when we decided well, I guess we should pioneer now too and we only pioneered two years and we were called to Gilead

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:11.799
So then we graduated in 1953

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:19.159
When your application in Gilead one question is are you willing to go any place in the world?

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:24.760
Brother Norah always would say a one-way ticket. So that was on your mind

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.400
We were happy to go and if we didn't get back then was okay

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.079
And

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:38.799
And then the 13 of us for one month we all went together back to India on a ship

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:47.439
We're a bit nervous because we didn't know just what kind of people we would be meeting or what kind of atmosphere we'd be

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:52.239
Experiencing that's why it was a shock when he landed in Bombay

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:58.159
Because all we could see was people people everywhere and noise

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.239
And then they gave us such hot food. We were burning all the way down

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:13.319
And then when we arrived there at missionary home at no furniture and we had to sleep on the floor from quite a few months before the furniture was made

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.319
We boiled our water. We filled our water when we went to the market

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.560
We've been all our vegetables and fruit home and we washed them with the solution and we were very careful in that respect

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.599
It was all a shock to us in many things. Yes

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.599
We made up our mind I guess that it's not going to be the same as Canada, we know

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:37.960
We didn't worry about things we had to put up with because we had the joy in the ministry

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:48.840
The society wanted us to get the joy booklet out and we had to just stand on the street with this carton of a literature and just keep calling out to the people and

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:53.199
Everybody would take it and they were so appreciative. Yeah, they were appreciative. Yeah

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:57.159
In those days, we had to put in 150 hours

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:02.199
And in South India, after four women were not out

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:09.039
So we had to get all our time in early in the morning and work right through till four o'clock. Sure did

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.960
We were using the Malayalam language and the children repeated what we said

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:23.280
They run ahead and tell people what we were talking about and they'd all yell

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.000
Madama, Madama, white woman, white woman and we had many studies in

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:32.759
We enjoyed the ministry and we enjoyed the hospitality

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.280
Be with the brothers and go to their homes and eat their food and do things the way they do things

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:42.039
So we had to make India our home

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.719
We lived in India about 50 years and

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.759
And then the news came that we had to leave. So that's why the governing body said well you go to Canada branched in

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:02.159
Well, it's like culture shock too. Yeah, it has to be so many years in India. A lot of things we had to sort of adjust here now

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:07.900
I'm working down in the laundry

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.819
Foley same folding and folding till we fall in

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.470
Oh

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:24.550
We always tell the younger ones to be in the full-time service serving Jehovah but this we think is a wonderful life to choose

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:32.110
It's good for the young people to learn when they're young like that and no doubt they'll make progress in the truth, too

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:40.029
Glad we started pioneering and moved about. Yeah, we lacked nothing really nothing to complain about
