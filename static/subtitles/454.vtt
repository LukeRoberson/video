00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:08.220
A newspaper in Japan, once quoted a Catholic priest, he said the God of the Old Testament,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.980
Yahweh, is a God of anger and I can't feel close to him.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.620
And then he added, but he developed and transformed into what is the God of the New Testament,

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.219
that is the God of love whom Jesus taught.

00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:23.980
Have you ever heard that?

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.980
A lot of people still think like this as if God has a split personality.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.219
They're uncomfortable when they read in the Bible that God gets angry sometimes.

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:35.219
Why is that?

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.420
Well, it may be for one of two reasons.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:45.259
First, there are outspoken critics in this world who constantly try to discredit Jehovah,

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:49.460
a prominent biologist for example made headlines a few years ago.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.619
He said in his book, the God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:56.619
all fiction.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.020
I stop the quote there because it gets much worse, but how blasphemous a viewpoint that is,

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.579
the more often people hear statements like this, the more they tend to believe them.

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:14.140
There's a second reason though, by some struggle with God's anger,

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:21.099
they have suffered an abusive relationship and now they're sensitive to any perceived abuse.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.579
Take Carolyn, for example, she said when my drunken father used to explode in anger,

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:33.579
his appearance changed. He became like a wolf bearing its teeth before attacking.

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.340
She says, I live this nightmare every day.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.500
Well, abuse like this can scar people for a long time.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:49.099
So how can we help sincere persons get past their fears about God's anger and draw closer to

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:54.459
Jehovah? Well, let's address the critics first and then see how we can reassure those who may

00:01:54.459 --> 00:02:02.700
be feeling insecure. First, let's make one thing clear, Jehovah does not have multiple personalities.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.979
When Jesus was on earth, he advocated the powerful truth that Jehovah is one.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.219
When a Jewish scribe asked him, what was the greatest of all commandments? What did he say?

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:23.500
Well, let's read Mark 12, 29 and 30 and see what his reply was in his own words.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.139
He answered by quoting today's text, Mark 12, 29 and 30.

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:40.860
Jesus answered, the first is, here, O Israel, Jehovah are God is one Jehovah and you must love Jehovah

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:46.460
your God with your whole heart, with your whole soul, with your whole mind and with your whole strength.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.139
So for Jesus, loving Jehovah for who he is, not for who we want him to be,

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.900
is really the most important decision any of us could make.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:06.539
Now, the pagan nations had all sorts of gods for different purposes and they would worship

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:13.500
different aspects of even the same God in different localities like the God Bale, for example.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.020
And something similar happened in other religions, say, for example, the Catholic Church with

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:25.340
its different manifestations of the worship of Mary. But things were very different in Israel.

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:32.139
They learned that there was only one God, Jehovah, who was responsible for everything.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:40.860
At each time they read Deuteronomy 6 and verse 4, they were reminded that God had one personality.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.659
So why does a God of love get angry sometimes? Well, the answer is quite simple.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.699
When Rebels challenged Jehovah's sovereignty, he had to defend his name and standards.

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:59.099
Rebellion did make him angry and rightly so.

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:05.259
But Jehovah's anger is always under control and guided by right principles.

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:13.740
As a father, he had to protect his household, respect for his own name and his love for his children

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:23.100
compelled him to act. At the same time, Jehovah is slow to anger and abundant in loving kindness.

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:27.180
His fundamental mood is not anger, but joy.

00:04:28.459 --> 00:04:34.860
And Jesus said that God loved the world so much he gave his only begotten son.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.899
Jehovah has been is and always will be a God of unchangeable love.

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:48.300
First John 4 and it says, God is love. It identifies who he is.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:57.019
But Jesus also said that God gave his son in order that everyone exercising faith in him

00:04:57.019 --> 00:05:06.060
might not be destroyed but have everlasting life. Did you notice that Jesus said those not exercising

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:12.860
faith will be destroyed? So Jehovah's personality didn't mellow over the years

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.899
as if it needed mellowing. It didn't transform from one personality to another.

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:28.300
His severity today against the wicked is no less nor his love any greater than it was in the past.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:34.139
Jehovah does not change. We can illustrate it like this perhaps.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.129
Criminals may know that a police officer is an arm of the law.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:49.529
His children may see him as a loving father that he is and his close friends may value him for

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:56.170
his good sense of humor. Now the police officer, the father and the friend are all the same person.

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:04.170
In each situation a different aspect of his personality stands out and it's the same with Jehovah.

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:14.089
In harmony with his name, he causes to become or becomes whatever he needs to in every situation

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:20.250
in order to fulfill his purpose, especially his purpose towards those who love him.

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:29.290
So if we want to get closer to Jehovah, we have to accept the full range of his beautiful,

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:39.290
multifaceted and unchanging personality. For those who love God, we don't fear his anger.

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:44.730
We learn to trust him because he's always kind and tender towards us.

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:53.850
Why can we say that? Well, open your Bibles with me to Jeremiah 29 and verse 11.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.930
And notice why we can be sure that Jehovah always wants the best for us,

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:08.060
as he did for his servants in the past and his own words.

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:13.740
For I well know the thoughts that I am thinking toward you declares Jehovah,

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:20.860
thoughts of peace and not of calamity to give you a future and a hope.

00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:31.180
Because Jehovah loves us, because he's always in full control of himself and circumstances around him.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:38.779
And because Jesus has already died for our sins, we can always feel safe with Jehovah.

00:07:39.339 --> 00:07:42.220
We do not ever need to fear approaching him.

00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:48.220
Very soon now, as Zechariah 14 and verse 9 predicts,

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.100
Jehovah must become king over all the earth.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:59.100
And in that day, the prophet said, Jehovah will prove to be one and his name one.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:06.860
Everyone in heaven and on earth will agree at that time that Jehovah our God is the universal sovereign.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:12.300
And you and I will gladly join our voices with that happy chorus.

00:08:12.939 --> 00:08:21.740
What a beautiful prospect that is.
