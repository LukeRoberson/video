00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:30.710
Olivia!

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:31.710
Thank you.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.710
Okay mom, I'm going to preach.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.710
See you.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:34.710
Bye mom.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.710
Love you.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:01:00.880
Have a good day.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.880
Okay, I'm totally posting that.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:25.510
Would she ever?

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:26.510
No, she would never.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.510
She's an angel.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.780
You know she's wild.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.780
Oh, she saw it.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.780
I don't believe.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.319
I think she likes guys.

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:43.319
What if she's into girls?

00:01:43.319 --> 00:02:03.150
I bet she's still a virgin.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.150
Hey, can I see that?

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.150
Yeah, of course.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.590
Here you go.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.590
Enjoy life forever.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.590
Now, how are you going to do that?

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.590
Well, that's a very good question actually.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.590
Well, I've got promises.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.590
No, no, no.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.590
Oh, not God, you.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.590
What are you doing?

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.590
Me?

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.590
Well, I try to help others.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.590
Try?

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.590
Man, all you do is stand next to your little car

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.590
while the rest of us stand up for your rights, bro.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.590
Well, I'm actually neutral.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.590
Neutral?

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.590
Ain't no neutral.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.590
You're just a coward.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:51.139
Take a trash.

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:53.139
How did it go?

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.139
It was a tough day at the car, but I'm okay.

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:56.139
I'm okay.

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:17.199
Olivia?

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:20.199
What's wrong?

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.050
I'm so sorry that happened to you.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:04:08.270
You know, it reminds me of a situation Paul was in.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:23.209
I think it was Acts chapter 16, in verse 23.

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:29.089
After they had inflicted many blows on them,

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.930
they threw them into prison and ordered the jailer

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.930
to guard them securely.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.459
Because he got such an order,

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:46.459
he threw them into the inner prison

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:51.470
and fastened their feet in the stocks.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.470
But about the middle of the night,

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.470
Paul and Silas were praying and praising God with song.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.470
And the prisoners were listening to them.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:10.069
What do you think made them want to sing?

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:12.069
They loved Jehovah.

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:21.019
And when they focused on that, how do you think they felt?

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:26.069
I think they felt some peace.

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:28.069
That's right.

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:32.069
How about we dig a little bit deeper?

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:38.709
What are you going to do?

00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:39.709
You're just a coward.

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:41.709
And all you do is stand next to your little guard.

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:42.709
You don't do anything.

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:43.709
You just stand next to your little guard.

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:44.709
Just a coward.

00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:45.709
I know neutral is a coward.

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:52.360
Gabe, what happened today?

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.360
It's just I've been yelled at in service before,

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:01.360
but this time I wanted to, I don't know.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.360
I wanted to go up to the girls and smash their phones.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.670
I'm so glad that you didn't.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.670
Yeah, but I feel guilty

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.670
because I was like, I was like so angry.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:24.819
It's okay.

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:27.819
Let's keep reading.

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:35.110
We had left off in verse 26.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.110
Suddenly a great earthquake occurred

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.110
so that the foundations of the jail were shaken.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.110
Moreover, all the doors were instantly open

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.110
and everyone's bonds came loose.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.110
When the jailer woke up and saw that the prison doors were open,

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.110
he drew his sword and was about to kill himself,

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.110
assuming that the prisoners had escaped.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:03.110
But Paul called out with a loud voice.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.110
Do not hurt yourself for we're all here.

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:11.100
So he asked for lights in Washington

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.100
and seized with trembling.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:19.139
He fell down before Paul and Silas.

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:22.139
Now, think about what the jailer had done to Paul.

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:29.160
He could have hated him for it.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:36.300
Yeah, he could have, but I guess he saw the jailer's pain

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:43.519
instead of just his own.

00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:45.519
Yeah, Paul loved his neighbor.

00:07:45.519 --> 00:08:07.180
He didn't hold back trying to save his life.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.899
Hey, how do you get the nerve to keep coming out here?

00:08:11.899 --> 00:08:13.899
Look, you were right.

00:08:13.899 --> 00:08:15.899
About what you said.

00:08:15.899 --> 00:08:18.899
No one should stand around while other people suffer injustice.

00:08:18.899 --> 00:08:21.899
So do something. Fight like we do.

00:08:21.899 --> 00:08:23.899
This is my way of making a difference.

00:08:23.899 --> 00:08:26.899
The only way that I know the world can really change.

00:08:26.899 --> 00:08:28.899
Come on, man, the Bible.

00:08:28.899 --> 00:08:30.899
Like, I get where you're thinking,

00:08:30.899 --> 00:08:33.899
but let me show you just one scripture.

00:08:33.899 --> 00:08:35.899
Kind of one scripture.

00:08:35.899 --> 00:08:37.899
So this is a verse in the Bible that convinced me

00:08:37.899 --> 00:08:39.899
of how I can make a difference.

00:08:39.899 --> 00:08:43.899
It's a Matthew chapter 24 verse 40.

00:08:43.899 --> 00:08:44.899
Here it says,

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:46.899
And this good news of the kingdom

00:08:46.899 --> 00:08:49.899
will be preached in all of the inhabited earth

00:08:49.899 --> 00:08:52.899
for a witness to all the nations

00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:55.899
and then the end will come.

00:08:55.899 --> 00:09:01.070
Guess who just walked in?

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:02.070
Olivia.

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:03.070
And there's Jake.

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.070
We know she.

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:05.070
What?

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:08.070
She's into growth.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:15.730
Olivia, what are you thinking?

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:18.730
I don't know how they can do that.

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:21.730
I don't even follow them.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:26.129
If this doesn't stop,

00:09:26.129 --> 00:09:30.980
I don't know if I can...

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.980
You're strong.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.980
Okay, you just can't let them get to you.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:56.730
It feels out of your control, doesn't it?

00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:00.730
Hey, I think we need another Bible example.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:03.730
Remember when we studied about the Shulamite girl?

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:09.899
Yeah, I remember.

00:10:09.899 --> 00:10:11.899
And who was pressuring her?

00:10:11.899 --> 00:10:22.409
Solomon.

00:10:22.409 --> 00:10:25.409
But she wasn't interested in him.

00:10:25.409 --> 00:10:26.409
Just like,

00:10:26.409 --> 00:10:30.409
I'm not interested in that boy Jake, so...

00:10:30.409 --> 00:10:32.409
But it wasn't just him.

00:10:32.409 --> 00:10:38.870
There were the daughters of Jerusalem and Solomon's court.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:41.870
They urged her to accept his attentions.

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:45.860
But do you remember what she said?

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.860
In song of Solomon, chapter 2.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:53.250
It says,

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:54.250
I put you under oath,

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:56.250
O daughters of Jerusalem,

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.250
by the gazelles and the doves of the fields.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:02.250
Do not try to awaken or arouse love in me,

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.250
until it feels inclined.

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:07.850
So despite all of the pressure,

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:09.850
who was really in control?

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:14.440
She was.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.330
No one was going to push her into something

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.330
that she didn't want to do.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:24.720
She even said,

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.720
I am a wall.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:34.740
You have the same power.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.740
And if you believe that,

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.740
it'll change how you handle the pressure.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:12:07.620
Now give me a hug.

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:08.620
I just posted it,

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.620
going like I did.

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:18.009
All they want is to see me give in.

00:12:18.009 --> 00:12:22.009
Why would I give them the satisfaction?

00:12:22.009 --> 00:12:26.009
My peace comes from doing the right thing.

00:12:26.009 --> 00:12:28.009
Nobody can make me stumble.

00:12:28.009 --> 00:12:36.149
I'm a wall.
