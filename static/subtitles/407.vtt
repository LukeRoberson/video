00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:04.049
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.169
This morning worship program is originating from world headquarters at Warwick, New York.

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:15.250
And brothers and sisters, it's a real privilege and pleasure to speak to all of you on this

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:21.609
special day when we observe the memorial of the death of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:27.289
Today's text will remind us of the unjust treatment that He suffered at the hands of sinners.

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.289
When we have brother William Malone follow here, Bill is a helper with the teaching committee.

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:35.609
Bill, will you read the text for us, please?

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:42.490
Friday, April the 19th, the memorial date after sundown.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.289
The text is taken from Psalm 118, verse 22.

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:53.609
The stone that the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone.

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:55.850
Thank you, Bill.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.049
Although Jesus was rejected by the leaders of the Jewish nation, what counted to him was

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:04.569
having Jehovah's approval.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:08.890
You know, I love the way the Apostle Peter put it, according to 1 Peter chapter 2 and

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.290
verse 4.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:18.569
Peter said that Jesus was rejected by men, but precious to God, isn't that nice?

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:22.209
Now if you're the type of person who gets a little bit upset when you're rejected at

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:27.609
the doors, maybe as someone slams the door in your face, why not just think about this

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:33.530
phrase, rejected by men, but precious to God?

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:41.569
Memorize it, rejected by men, precious to God, and then think about it, it'll help.

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:46.010
Now speaking of the ministry, I thought I'd focus the rest of my comments on the important

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.609
work we all have to do today to invite as many as possible to the memorial.

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:57.489
If you have time off from work today, no doubt you'll be sharing in the ministry, and

00:01:57.489 --> 00:02:02.810
that's what Bethel family members all over the world are going to be doing today.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.569
But whether you have time off or not, there are things you can do to make sure that as many

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.569
as possible are in attendance tonight.

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.810
If you have to go to work or to school, why not talk to a workmate, a schoolmate whom

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.210
you think would be willing to attend the memorial?

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.650
You might be happy at the outcome.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.849
And don't forget to get in touch with your Bible students and return visits today.

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.009
I'm going to repeat that.

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:38.409
Don't forget to get in touch with your Bible students and return visits today, even if

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.770
you've already invited them to the memorial.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:42.770
Why?

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.289
Well, your return visits might have misplaced the invitation, and perhaps they've forgotten

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:49.770
what day it is.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.969
All right, return visits, but what about our Bible students?

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:58.729
Sometimes we take it for granted that such and such a Bible student is going to be there

00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:00.169
and he doesn't show up.

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:06.289
And later, we learn that he allowed some trivial matter to interfere with his attendance.

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:10.289
A little extra encouragement won't hurt.

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:14.530
And what about those who used to associate with this but are inactive?

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.530
It seems to me that they fall into two categories.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.930
You have some who would never miss the memorial.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.409
They appreciate what Christ has done and they're there.

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.370
And we love them, and we're so glad to see them.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.409
And then there's a second group who may feel that it's hypocritical on their part to attend

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:36.250
the memorial because they've missed every other meeting during the year.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.449
They have to start somewhere, don't they?

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:45.050
So we want to give them loving reassurance and a warm invitation to come.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.810
And don't forget unbelieving husbands who might respond better to an invitation from

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.210
an outsider than from their wife.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:01.849
Friends don't underestimate the value of a brief visit or a phone call to an inactive person.

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.770
One time ago, on the day of the memorial, the visiting speaker and the coordinator of

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.729
the body of elders paid a visit to a brother who was inactive.

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:15.330
Now that brother hadn't attended a meeting for 15 years.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.850
And yet before that, he had been very active in the truth of fact.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.689
He'd enjoyed many privileges in the organization.

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:24.850
What did the brothers do?

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.529
They simply listened.

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:31.769
As the brother relived the experiences he'd enjoyed when he was active.

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:38.329
At the end of the conversation, they simply said, we'd love to see you with the memorial.

00:04:38.329 --> 00:04:40.009
Wouldn't you come?

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:42.129
The brother came.

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:48.209
Now most in the congregation didn't know who he was, but they gave him a warm welcome.

00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:49.610
And you know what?

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.649
That was all it took.

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:53.810
That brother never looked back.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.529
He was faithful to Jehovah for the rest of his life.

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:03.410
Now what about some of you dear ones who have been asked to work secularly at the night?

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:10.410
You may be new on the job, and maybe your boss has the reputation for being a bit inflexible.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.730
You might say, he'd never give me the time off.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.449
What to do?

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.850
Why not approach Jehovah in earnest prayer?

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.050
Tell him how you feel?

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.850
Ask him to touch the heart of your boss and ask him to help you to present your request

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:31.370
respectfully and in an appealing way.

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.209
You might be surprised at the outcome.

00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:41.009
Jehovah's servants have always taken the memorial seriously.

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:46.009
Our brothers and sisters even observed it in concentration camps and labor camps,

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:50.009
such as this one in Mordovia.

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:54.689
Following that pattern, in our day our young brothers who were imprisoned in Korea

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:59.930
didn't allow prison bars to prevent them from keeping the festival.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:05.449
In parts of Africa, interested ones may have to travel long distances to get to the village

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:09.889
or the city where the memorial is going to be observed.

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:16.649
In Tanzania, a Bible student moved to a remote area where there was no congregation.

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:21.209
The nearest congregation was more than 60 miles away.

00:06:21.209 --> 00:06:24.529
Out of those in Western lands, that may not seem like much.

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:31.410
But in the area where he lived, that was going to require a grueling eight-hour bus trip.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:32.410
Why?

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.569
Number one, the roads were bad.

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:40.089
Number two, the bus made a lot of stops.

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:41.529
But he was there.

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:47.129
And after the meeting, the man pleaded with the brothers to visit him, at least once

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:49.529
a month so he could continue his studies.

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:54.089
Well, that man had put forth an effort to attend the memorial so the congregation had

00:06:54.089 --> 00:07:00.209
to reciprocate and a few weeks later a special pioneer couple visited him.

00:07:00.209 --> 00:07:05.490
To their surprise, they found that the student was already studying with seventeen other

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.970
people in the village.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:12.209
How important is it to attend the memorial?

00:07:12.209 --> 00:07:18.209
In Congo, a traveling overseer in his wife showed great determination to observe it.

00:07:18.209 --> 00:07:23.050
They had to travel on a very bad road to a congregation where the memorial was going

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.050
to be observed.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:29.129
And the road was so bad that the motorcycle they were riding on broke down.

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:34.250
There was a defective part and no replacement available.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.529
So the traveling overseer and his wife were stuck.

00:07:37.529 --> 00:07:44.129
They were going to have to observe the memorial right there at an unfamiliar village.

00:07:44.129 --> 00:07:45.930
There was a problem.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:47.689
No congregation.

00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:49.449
No brothers.

00:07:49.449 --> 00:07:54.089
Undeterred, the brother went to the village chief and explained the importance of the

00:07:54.089 --> 00:07:56.850
occasion and the chief responded.

00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:01.850
He allowed the brother to observe the memorial on his property and he even commissioned some

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:06.209
young man to clean the place up and build a platform for the speaker.

00:08:06.209 --> 00:08:09.290
So now the location was ready.

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:11.370
But you have to have an audience.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:15.769
Well, a couple had invitations and these were distributed in the village.

00:08:15.769 --> 00:08:21.050
And as a result, 80 villagers attended the memorial.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:25.490
Now, of course, what's a memorial without music without songs?

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:27.610
These people were not witnesses.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:30.009
They didn't know our songs.

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:35.649
But the traveling overseer's wife was a good singer and so she helped the audience to sing

00:08:35.649 --> 00:08:39.289
the two memorial songs.

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:45.169
In the evening of Africa, in Liberia, a congregation of 130 decided that they were going to do everything

00:08:45.169 --> 00:08:49.370
in their power to invite many, many people to the memorial.

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:55.090
So in the days leading up to the memorial, eight publishers worked from nine in the morning

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:58.409
till six at night, distributing invitations.

00:08:58.409 --> 00:09:03.809
Now, the memorial was held in an open field and do you know how many attended?

00:09:03.809 --> 00:09:11.970
A congregation of 130, 3,410.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:17.649
In many places in Africa, it's common for a congregation of 100 or more to have an attendance

00:09:17.649 --> 00:09:19.009
into the thousands.

00:09:19.009 --> 00:09:23.610
Well, you might say, all right, that's Africa, but in our congregation, we're not going

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.649
to have a thousand people.

00:09:25.649 --> 00:09:31.289
But you are going to work just as hard as our African brothers do.

00:09:31.289 --> 00:09:37.330
And Jehovah is going to bless you just the same as He has blessed them.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:42.250
In addition to inviting interested ones, there's another thing all of us can do to get ready

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.409
for the memorial.

00:09:44.409 --> 00:09:50.929
At first Corinthians chapter 5 and verse 7, Paul wrote in part, so then, let us keep the

00:09:50.929 --> 00:09:56.409
festival with sincerity and truth.

00:09:56.409 --> 00:10:01.809
Now whether we're the anointed or of the great crowd, all of us should examine ourselves

00:10:01.809 --> 00:10:06.809
now to see if we can do more to be pleasing to Jehovah.

00:10:06.809 --> 00:10:10.690
Are we holding a grudge against a brother or sister?

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:13.649
Now would be a good time to let it go.

00:10:13.649 --> 00:10:19.330
Are we allowing some bad habit to hold us back for making spiritual progress?

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:25.970
Now would be an excellent time to take decisive action against it.

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:30.090
Just doing this in remembrance of Me.

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:34.409
That's a command Jehovah's Witnesses take very seriously.

00:10:34.409 --> 00:10:40.210
So our prayer is that Jehovah will bless your zealous efforts to invite others to join

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:41.210
us.

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:47.809
Now Bill, will you please read today's comment from examining the Scriptures?

00:10:47.809 --> 00:10:52.970
The builders, the Jewish leaders, rejected the Messiah.

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:58.649
Our rejection was far more than just turning their backs on Jesus or refusing to accept

00:10:58.649 --> 00:11:00.970
Him as the Christ.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:05.529
Many Jews rejected Him to the point of clamoring for His death.

00:11:05.529 --> 00:11:10.809
Yes, they contributed to Jesus being killed.

00:11:10.809 --> 00:11:17.450
If Jesus was rejected and killed, how could He become the chief cornerstone?

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:22.850
That could come about only by His being resurrected to life again.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:29.850
The Apostle Peter spoke of Jesus Christ, the Nazarene, whom you executed on a stake,

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:33.850
but whom God raised up from the dead.

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:39.970
This resurrected Son thus became the only one whose name was given among men by which

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:44.480
we must get saved.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:55.049
Now please follow along as we enjoy today's recorded Bible reading.

00:11:55.049 --> 00:12:00.809
From the first day of the unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying,

00:12:00.809 --> 00:12:04.850
Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:12.570
He said, Go into the city to sow and sow and say to Him, The teacher says, My appointed

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:19.090
time is near, I will celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your home.

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:28.940
So the disciples did as Jesus instructed them and prepared for the Passover.

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:35.340
The day of the unleavened bread now arrived, on which the Passover sacrifice must be offered.

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:43.139
So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, Go and get the Passover ready for us to eat.

00:12:43.139 --> 00:12:47.419
They said to Him, Where do you want us to get it ready?

00:12:47.419 --> 00:12:53.980
He said to them, Look, when you enter into the city, a man carrying an earthenware water

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.019
jar will meet you.

00:12:56.019 --> 00:13:01.539
Follow him into the house that he enters and say to the landlord of the house, The teacher

00:13:01.539 --> 00:13:08.740
says to you, Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:13.379
And that man will show you a large furnished upper room.

00:13:13.379 --> 00:13:15.539
Get it ready there.

00:13:15.539 --> 00:13:26.340
So they left and found it just as he had told them and they prepared for the Passover.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:31.580
When evening came, he was reclining at the table with the twelve disciples.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:39.620
While they were eating, he said, Truly I say to you, One of you will betray me.

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:47.740
Being very much grieved at this, each and every one began to say to him, Lord, it is not

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:50.179
I, is it?

00:13:50.179 --> 00:13:54.899
In reply, he said, The one who dips his hand with me into the

00:13:54.899 --> 00:13:58.580
bowl is the one who will betray me.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:04.419
True, the Son of Man is going away just as it is written about him.

00:14:04.419 --> 00:14:09.340
But woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:14.539
It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.

00:14:14.539 --> 00:14:23.460
Judas, who was about to betray him, replied, It is not I, is it Rabbi?

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:28.980
Jesus said to him, You yourself said it.

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:35.259
As they continued eating, Jesus took a loaf and after saying a blessing, he broke it

00:14:35.259 --> 00:14:44.179
and giving it to the disciples, he said, Take, eat, this means my body.

00:14:44.179 --> 00:14:50.899
And taking a cup, he offered thanks and gave it to them, saying, Drink out of it, all of

00:14:50.899 --> 00:14:51.899
you.

00:14:51.899 --> 00:14:58.179
For this means my blood of the covenant, which is to be poured out in behalf of many for forgiveness

00:14:58.179 --> 00:15:00.019
of sins.

00:15:00.019 --> 00:15:05.940
But I say to you, I will buy no means drink again any of this product of the vine until

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:11.019
that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father.

00:15:11.019 --> 00:15:17.620
Finally, after singing praises, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:24.580
And Jesus said to them, All of you will be stumbled in connection with me on this night.

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:29.980
For it is written, I will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:31.580
about.

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:37.299
But after I have been raised up, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.

00:15:37.299 --> 00:15:42.980
But Peter, in response, said to him, Although all the others are stumbled in connection

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:46.899
with you, I will never be stumbled.

00:15:46.899 --> 00:15:55.419
Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, On this night, before a rooster crows, you will

00:15:55.419 --> 00:15:59.220
disown me three times.

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:07.820
Peter said to him, Even if I should have to die with you, I will buy no means disown you.

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:12.539
All the other disciples also said the same thing.

00:16:12.539 --> 00:16:19.179
When Jesus came with them to the spot called Gethsemane, and he said to the disciples,

00:16:19.179 --> 00:16:23.899
Sit down here while I go over there and pray.

00:16:23.899 --> 00:16:29.899
And taking along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to feel grieved and to be

00:16:29.899 --> 00:16:32.100
greatly troubled.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:41.019
Then he said to them, I am deeply grieved, even to death, stay here and keep on the watch

00:16:41.019 --> 00:16:42.980
with me.

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:51.940
And going a little way forward, he fell face down, praying, My Father, if it is possible,

00:16:51.940 --> 00:17:01.019
let this cup pass away from me, Yet not as I will, but as you will.

00:17:01.019 --> 00:17:08.200
He returned to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, Could you not

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:13.240
so much as keep on the watch for one hour with me?

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:20.640
Keep on the watch and pray continually so that you may not enter into temptation.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:25.680
The Spirit, of course, is eager, but the flesh is weak.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:34.079
Again, a second time, he went off and prayed, My Father, if it is not possible for this

00:17:34.079 --> 00:17:40.759
to pass away, unless I drink it, let your will take place.

00:17:40.759 --> 00:17:47.519
And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.

00:17:47.519 --> 00:17:53.960
So leaving them, he again went off and prayed for a third time, saying once more the same

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.559
thing.

00:17:55.559 --> 00:18:02.400
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, At such a time as this, you are sleeping

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.400
and resting.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:11.680
Look, the hour has drawn near for the Son of Man to be betrayed into the hands of sinners.

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.519
Get up, let us go.

00:18:14.519 --> 00:18:18.920
Look, My betrayer has drawn near.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:25.319
While he was still speaking, Look, Judas, one of the twelve came, and with him a large

00:18:25.319 --> 00:18:32.359
crowd with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people.

00:18:32.359 --> 00:18:40.599
Now his betrayer had given them a sign, saying, Whoever it is I kiss, he is the one.

00:18:40.599 --> 00:18:43.000
Take him into custody.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:52.880
And going straight up to Jesus, he said, Greetings, Rabbi, and gave him a tender kiss.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:59.400
But Jesus said to him, Fellow, for what purpose are you present?

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:04.799
Then they came forward and seized Jesus and took him into custody.

00:19:04.799 --> 00:19:10.240
But look, one of those with Jesus reached out his hand and drew his sword and struck

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:14.880
the slave of the high priest, taking off his ear.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:20.279
Then Jesus said to him, Return your sword to its place.

00:19:20.279 --> 00:19:25.400
For all those who take up the sword will perish by the sword.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:30.559
Or do you think that I cannot appeal to my father to supply me at this moment more

00:19:30.559 --> 00:19:33.599
than twelve legions of angels?

00:19:33.599 --> 00:19:40.759
In that case, how would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must take place this way?

00:19:40.759 --> 00:19:46.880
In that hour Jesus said to the crowds, Did you come out to arrest me with swords and

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.599
clubs as against a robber?

00:19:49.599 --> 00:19:54.960
Day after day I used to sit in the temple teaching, and yet you did not take me into

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.599
custody.

00:19:56.599 --> 00:20:03.039
But all of this has taken place for the writings of the prophets to be fulfilled.

00:20:03.039 --> 00:20:09.650
Then all the disciples abandoned him and fled.

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:15.450
It's a joy to be associated with you, and on behalf of the governing body, I'd like

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:21.009
to wish all of you a successful day in Jehovah's service and a blessed memorial observance

00:20:21.009 --> 00:20:22.369
tonight.

00:20:22.369 --> 00:20:27.089
Be assured that we love you all very much.

00:20:27.089 --> 00:20:34.529
Now let's all get busy and see what we can do to invite as many as possible to the memorial.
