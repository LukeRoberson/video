00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:09.939
The text reminds us of using our financial means to make friends with Jehovah and Jesus and even though a Jehovah owns everything

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:19.699
Seeing as giving making sacrifices makes him happy the result is a close relationship or in the words of our scripture text

00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:22.059
We become friends

00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:28.100
Now this important principle was known by the men of old David for example was one of them

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.620
And he was very much interested in having a close relationship with Jehovah

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.060
Now in a second Samuel chapter 24

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.259
We find David in a very difficult situation because of his own major mistake

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:46.340
He has lost the Jehovah's favor now

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.899
What would he do in order to reestablish this close friendship with Jehovah?

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.899
After repenting his sin and being faced with the consequences of his wrongdoing

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.899
He was told to build an altar on the threshing floor of a rounder

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:08.700
Let us see how David reacted when a rounder wanted to give this place to David as a gift

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.099
We read in second Samuel chapter 24 in verse 24

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:21.060
However, the king David said to a rounder, no, I must buy it from you for a prize

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.659
I will not offer up to Jehovah my God burns sacrifices that cost me nothing

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:32.659
So David bought the threshing floor and the cattle for 50 civil shakles

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:41.579
True, it was repentance and obedience that paved the way for David to reestablish his friendship with Jehovah

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.780
However, as we just read David understood that

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:52.299
Giving from his own material possessions or in the words of our scripture text today from his unrighteous riches

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:54.939
Would make Jehovah happy

00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:57.739
David wanted to give at a cost

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:05.659
Now how are we imitating David in this regard? Let us look at some ways how we do this as individuals

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.620
as congregation

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.060
And as a global organization, how do we use our financial means to make friends in heaven?

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:18.139
Let us first talk about how we do this as individuals

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.780
Many of us are being guided by a Bible principle found in 1 Corinthians 16

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.780
Here the Apostle Paul talks about a collection that likely involved money

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.259
The congregation Corinth was encouraged to help the Judean Christians

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:41.819
So what principle did Paul establish in this connection? This is 1 Corinthians 16 we read verse 2

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.300
On the first day of every week

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.900
Each of you should set something aside according to his own means so that collection will not take place when I arrive

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:03.340
Paul recommended that each Christian in Corinth make it a priority to set something aside to donate to those in need

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.979
So the principle is to plan our spending on to make giving a part of it

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.180
And this is what we can observe despite the fact that special full-time servants have very limited financial means

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.780
Many plan their giving many have established recurring donations on our website

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.180
for the congregation or

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.740
and or for the

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:33.500
Organization for the Kingdom interest worldwide in this way. We do not need to think about it every month

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:42.379
But might only reconsider it once in a while to see whether our giving is still in line with our overall budget

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.860
Thank you so much for what you do in this regard and can you see how Chihuah

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.580
your friend

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.580
loves you for doing this

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.460
Now what do we do as a congregation

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.379
In order to use our funds to make friends in heaven

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:06.620
We know from the monthly accounts report that all available funds are being used for supporting Kingdom interests

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.020
Covering the monthly expenses of the congregation's part of it

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:18.699
However in addition to it the congregations are applying a principle found in second Corinthians chapter 8

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.420
The Apostle Paul referred here to the collection we read earlier about and

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.779
He emphasized the reason for this collection

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:32.620
Now let's read second Corinthians chapter 8 verses 13 and 14

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:36.139
For I do not want to make it easy for others

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.620
But difficult for you

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.620
But that by means of an equalizing

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:48.060
Your surplus at the present time might offset their need so that their surplus might also offer your

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:53.100
Offset your deficiencies that there may be an equalizing

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:01.259
So the congregation in Corinth was encouraged to use their financial means to support others who we're in need

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:05.819
This principle of equalizing is something we find in the congregation

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.100
For example when it comes to donating for the Kingdom Hall and assembly hall program

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.540
You might remember that once a year the body of elders

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:21.420
Recommended resolution to the congregation for contributing to the building and maintenance of Kingdom Halls and assembly halls

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.259
why

00:05:23.579 --> 00:05:25.420
For at least two reasons

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.100
First the congregations themselves benefit from the local design and construction arrangement

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.220
That is why for example a nearby congregation who

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.300
Just benefited from this arrangement by remodeling their Kingdom Hall

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.980
Increased their monthly contribution to the program

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:46.699
But then there's this second reason in line with the principle that we just read

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.139
It is an expression of love for our brothers in other country

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:56.620
As a congregation we want to give we want to make sacrifices

00:05:57.579 --> 00:06:04.300
To support the building and maintenance of these places of worship in other countries making sacrifices

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:12.060
In support of those who are in need the congregation does not just want to give the left over so to speak

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:21.180
But supports the arrangement wholeheartedly and all the brothers and sisters who are benefiting from this giving spirit

00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:23.899
They say thank you

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.860
And Jehovah blesses the congregation

00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:34.860
Now finally how do we as a global organization use financial means in order to make friends in heaven

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:41.740
First of all the scriptural arrangement has been put in place that the governing body is entrusted with

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.540
Decision making on how to use

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:48.220
The financial means of the organization and

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:55.660
The funds are exclusively used for our purposes which is our religious purposes

00:06:56.459 --> 00:07:04.220
Now let's look at one of the many Bible principles that apply in using these funds. Let us please turn to Matthew chapter 10

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:11.579
It was Jesus who gave this instruction to his disciples here in Matthew chapter 10

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.620
Let's read verse 8

00:07:15.339 --> 00:07:16.300
He said

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:22.139
Cure the sick raise up the dead make lepers clean expel demons and now the principle

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.500
You received free

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.660
give free

00:07:27.899 --> 00:07:36.220
Now did the apostles follow this directive? Yes, and they even continued when Jesus died and later on

00:07:37.019 --> 00:07:40.300
The organization does that very same we are not selling our

00:07:40.459 --> 00:07:46.459
Bibles and publication we are not expecting or asking for admission fees to our meetings and conventions

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.899
We we are not even having fundraising events

00:07:51.339 --> 00:07:56.620
But then see that for example in 2018 the organization organization spent

00:07:57.339 --> 00:08:04.379
2014 million US dollar in supporting the circuit overseers the missionaries and their special pioneers

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.060
and then think about the fact that

00:08:08.459 --> 00:08:12.060
You're in the same time 20,331

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:17.180
Batellites served at the various branches and we all got it our modest allowance

00:08:18.139 --> 00:08:20.139
And we all have something to eat

00:08:20.779 --> 00:08:26.060
And then see that the branch facilities need to be maintained and I have been maintained

00:08:27.339 --> 00:08:29.339
or think about the relief ministry

00:08:30.779 --> 00:08:37.980
In addition to the voluntary work of so many brothers and sisters and in addition to their personal

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:39.419
funds that they

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:44.620
Spend in order to help the organization spends millions on the relief

00:08:45.419 --> 00:08:46.620
ministry

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:52.059
So our activity as a global organization is not performed in order to make financial profit

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.940
But in order to fulfill our assignment that Jesus gave

00:08:55.899 --> 00:08:59.899
So in this way whether we look at it as from the perspective of an individual

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.740
the congregation or the global organization

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:10.139
Let us continue to give from what we have let us continue to make sacrifices

00:09:10.779 --> 00:09:14.940
And we will be happy with having to hold on Jesus as our friends
