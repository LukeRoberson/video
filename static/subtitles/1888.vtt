00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:08.609
In this update, I'd like to talk with you about something very close to my heart, Bethel.

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:14.009
When I learned the truth as a teenager, I made Bethel's service a goal.

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.530
After I was baptized, I pioneered for two years, and then I came to Bethel, and I've

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.530
been here for 36 years now.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:28.010
So I'm happy to talk to you about how things are going at Bethel, and how the worldwide

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.289
Bethel family is coping with the pandemic.

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:38.049
No doubt you'll be encouraged to hear what helps them to remain joyful in their service.

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:43.890
Many of you have expressed appreciation, saying that during this pandemic we have continued

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.530
to receive spiritual food.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:54.049
This includes our weekly meetings, news articles on jw.org, new publications, monthly

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:58.969
broadcasts, convention programs, and more.

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.969
All of this is possible because of the willing spirit and hard work of our Bethel family

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:08.730
under challenging circumstances.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.090
Around the world, the Bethel family has been sheltering in place.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.810
In most cases, for about one year, our Bethelites have sacrificed opportunities to spend time

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.250
in person with family and dear friends, and they've done this with a cooperative and

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.010
willing spirit.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.730
Why?

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.049
Because they loved Jehovah and Jesus, and because they love you.

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.090
They want to serve the needs of our worldwide brotherhood.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.769
That's been a sacrifice for them, but we know that's also been a sacrifice for all of

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:49.250
you who have family and friends at Bethel, because you haven't been able to see them

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.049
in person during these difficult times.

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.489
In a sense, you've made a contribution to the work by helping members of your family

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:03.810
who are at Bethel to be able to stay and concentrate on their work.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.890
What a beautiful gift your support has been.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.490
Of course, when this all began, few imagined it would stretch on for so long.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.449
In the following video, you'll see what some of our hard-working Bethelites have been

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:27.930
doing to maintain their joy and keep that kingdom work going without interruption.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.449
Three things that I miss traveling, playing sports, and tackle stands.

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:35.330
I really miss my family.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:42.129
Well, as I'm living on my own, the most difficult thing for me is that I miss the brothers.

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:45.930
I don't have as much contact with them as I did before.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.129
But most of all, I miss my two young nieces.

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.409
I'm very close to them.

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:57.129
I really miss hugging the sisters and the kids in the congregation.

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.610
Everything changed overnight and very suddenly.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.610
The brothers from outside Bethel, who came to help us with the recordings, could not do this anymore.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.009
So the work increased considerably.

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:14.289
Especially for the regional convention, we had more work than ever.

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:17.969
Right before the pandemic, I was assigned to a new branch.

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:23.210
That means learning of brand new culture and starting again, developing friendships.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:30.129
I didn't feel as busy as before, or as busy as I would have liked to have been.

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:40.159
And I have to admit, I sometimes have the feeling that I'm just not as useful as I was before.

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:44.520
My dad had to be admitted to a hospital because he became very ill.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.800
And I felt helpless and guilty.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:53.199
Because I couldn't do what I really wanted to do to be with my family.

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:58.319
Because we live in an apartment right in the city center, we can't go out.

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:06.439
When you're lonely and trapped inside four walls, it's very easy to get lost in negative thoughts.

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:10.240
I like to think about the big legal example of Joseph.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.719
He did not concentrate on negative aspects of his situation.

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:21.360
But rather, he always thought of doing his best with all the assignments he was given.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.639
Of course, the Bible has helped me a lot.

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:29.079
I think about Bible texts such as Psalm 94, verse 18 and 19, where it says,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.600
Your loyal love, O Jehovah, kept supporting me.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.639
When anxieties overwhelm me, you comforted and soothed me.

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.600
Thinking about the paradise, I picture myself with my mom and my sister, Carol,

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.240
walking along the beach and watching a beautiful sunset

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.680
will have all eternity to be together.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:55.399
I do exercise every day, and I also connect with the congregation for the preaching work.

00:04:55.399 --> 00:05:01.800
Increasing the time I spend in the preaching work has allowed me to focus on helping other people.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.720
Auxiliary pioneering has been my window into the world outside.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.639
When my friends and family ask me how I'm doing, I tell them that I'm okay.

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:15.720
We don't try to paint an unrealistic picture that all is fine and that there are no challenges,

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.160
but we try always to be positive.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.560
My wife and I tell them to remain calm, because Bethel, they take good care of us.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.800
But they still know that it's not easy.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:32.680
Every time I see them smile in a video call, it's as if they were given my heart a big hug.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.600
Also, doing practical things for our parents.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.720
For example, we would connect with them and read the daily texts together.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.920
Being a Bethel during the pandemic is a great privilege,

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.600
because it gives me the circumstance to be a source of encouragement

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.560
for those at Bethel that are going through a rough time.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.319
But especially for the friends that are out in the front lines of this battle.

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:58.920
Being a Bethel makes me feel deeply indebted to Jehovah.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.040
He's been taking care of us spiritually, emotionally and physically.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.759
And we are here serving at Bethel as it has been said,

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:15.240
as the supply line to support the brothers.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.600
I'm doing this at the most crucial moment of history,

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.959
and I'm seeing all of this up close.

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:29.800
That's why every sacrifice I make for this privilege is worth it.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.439
We deeply appreciate our Bethelites,

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:35.399
along with their families and their congregations,

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:40.360
for all the sacrifices they're making and support of the Kingdom work.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:45.240
We keep all of you dear brothers and sisters in our prayers.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.319
As you saw from the video,

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:52.439
like you, our Bethelites deal with anxieties during the pandemic.

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:54.439
It's normal to have these feelings.

00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:58.519
We know that the trials that we're experiencing are going to end.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.639
But in the meantime, we're dealing with very real human emotions.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.879
So what can we do to cope?

00:07:07.079 --> 00:07:12.600
First, be honest about it with Jehovah and express to him what you're dealing with.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.600
When David prayed to Jehovah in a time of crisis,

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.439
he said at Psalm 142 and verse 2,

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:25.240
Before him, I pour out my concern.

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:29.079
Before him, I tell about my distress.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.439
We can do the same.

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:36.439
Pour out your concerns and anxieties to Jehovah.

00:07:37.079 --> 00:07:40.519
He promises to help us cope if we have faith.

00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:43.079
Pray for faith each day.

00:07:43.959 --> 00:07:48.920
Along with this, keep in mind that today's problems are only temporary.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.720
The last days had a beginning and the last days will have an end.

00:07:54.519 --> 00:07:59.240
This pandemic had a beginning and this pandemic will have an end.

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:03.560
The Apostle Paul called such trials momentary.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:09.720
And this is the case even more so as we move toward the end of this system of things.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.319
At 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and verses 17 and 18, he said,

00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:19.399
For though the tribulation is momentary and light,

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:26.759
it works out for us a glory that is of more and more surpassing greatness and is everlasting.

00:08:27.399 --> 00:08:32.519
While we keep our eyes not on the things seen, but on the things unseen,

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:39.080
for the things seen are temporary, but the things unseen are everlasting.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:47.320
That inspired advice benefited the early Christians and it can benefit all of God's people today.

00:08:48.679 --> 00:08:55.159
We command all of you for your faithful endurance and for remaining busy in your service to Jehovah.

00:08:56.039 --> 00:09:02.200
Through your efforts along with the power of Jehovah's spirit, not only has the kingdom

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:07.639
were continued, but it's also moving forward and expanding in exciting ways.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:14.440
One example of that is the World Headquarters Project at Ramapo, New York,

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.480
announced at the 2019 annual meeting.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:23.080
Have you been wondering how the Ramapo project has been affected by the pandemic?

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:30.679
We're happy to share this behind the scenes report on how things have been progressing.

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:44.259
On the January 2020 monthly broadcast, our brothers around the world learned

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:51.700
that the governing body had determined it was Jehovah's direction and approval has been given

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:56.820
for a site dedicated primarily to media production in Ramapo.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:04.019
Well, just three months later, a once in a generation event COVID-19

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:11.460
brought grinding to a halt the plans that large institutions even nations had in mind.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.419
How were the plans for Ramapo affected?

00:10:15.379 --> 00:10:20.899
Was it really the right time for Jehovah's organization to start a major construction project?

00:10:22.259 --> 00:10:29.379
As we review the events of 2020, look out not only for clear evidence of Jehovah's direction and

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:36.179
blessing, but also the conclusion that Job once came to when he said to Jehovah,

00:10:37.139 --> 00:10:40.419
nothing you have in mind is impossible for you to do.

00:10:42.019 --> 00:10:46.100
For a period here in New York, non-essential construction activities were restricted.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:50.740
However, at the exact time our project schedule required it,

00:10:51.379 --> 00:10:56.259
the town of Ramapo started holding town board meetings over, you guessed it, Zoom.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:01.860
That meant that even though we were in the midst of the unfolding global chaos,

00:11:02.419 --> 00:11:09.139
we were still able to meet a milestone on July 8, 2020 when we had our first project meeting with

00:11:09.139 --> 00:11:15.940
the town board. And we have clearly seen Jehovah's blessing in the meetings we have had with them since then.

00:11:17.379 --> 00:11:23.779
We hit a second and much more significant milestone on December 9, 2020.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:31.779
When the town approved our scoping document, like the homework, a teacher assigns a student

00:11:31.779 --> 00:11:37.539
in order to pass an important grade, we now know the information we should provide the town

00:11:37.539 --> 00:11:40.580
in order to obtain permission to start construction.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:46.980
When will that be? Currently, we are on course for the end of 2021.

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:51.940
That is a number of months earlier than had originally been planned for.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:12:00.740
Even before the pandemic. So just as Job said, nothing Jehovah has in mind is impossible.

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:08.929
Since April 2019, when the construction project committee was appointed,

00:12:09.649 --> 00:12:15.330
the design of the site and the first buildings to be constructed has advanced tremendously.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:22.210
Many key lessons taken from recent large projects have influenced the direction

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:27.809
that the worldwide design construction department under the direction of the publishing committee

00:12:27.809 --> 00:12:37.570
have given. The Ramapo site is 249 acres. The buildings are about 160 feet above sterling

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:43.570
mine road. The primary interest of sterling mine road brings you first to the visitor center,

00:12:44.289 --> 00:12:47.889
which will accommodate 1,200 visitors per day.

00:12:48.289 --> 00:12:57.169
The studio building with its sound stages is in the center of the site and adjacent to the studios

00:12:57.169 --> 00:13:05.330
are workshops. Over the ridge line is the back lot for outdoor sets and filming.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:14.450
Next to the studios are the offices, reception and the events building.

00:13:15.409 --> 00:13:22.769
This building can be configured as either a large assembly space for 1,300 attendees,

00:13:22.769 --> 00:13:28.210
a large dining room for 1,200 people, or some yet to be defined function.

00:13:29.649 --> 00:13:36.049
On the west of the site are residences for 1,290 volunteers.

00:13:37.649 --> 00:13:43.809
Much time and energy has been invested in the research of the best energy options for the site.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:51.970
This led to the decision to use electricity as the primary energy source. A vast geothermal

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:57.649
well field located beneath the studios will heat and cool the entire complex.

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:06.450
120,000 square feet of photovoltaic panels will create electricity, which is then stored in an

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:14.289
industrial grade battery bank and can thus be used at any time. The result is that the site

00:14:14.289 --> 00:14:23.490
has its own micro grid with the ability to make, to store and then redirect energy around the site

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:29.809
where it is needed. Many of us who generally work in an office environment have gotten used to

00:14:29.809 --> 00:14:35.409
working from home during the pandemic. Will that affect the need for office space on the Rambo project?

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:41.490
Frankly, it's impossible to predict what the configuration of office space will be in the future.

00:14:42.289 --> 00:14:48.370
Therefore, flexibility in the layout of future office space is the most important design criteria.

00:14:49.409 --> 00:14:55.889
The building is divided into 10 foot by 15 foot modules. Each module has a ceiling cloud above it,

00:14:55.889 --> 00:15:02.370
containing heating and cooling unit and lighting. Power and data wiring are an erased floor to allow

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:09.169
for a variety of configurations and reconfigurations. Demountable partitions extend from the floor

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:15.809
to the deck above. They can transform one module into a single office or small conference room.

00:15:16.529 --> 00:15:22.529
Partitions can group several modules together to form a larger conference room or the floor can

00:15:22.529 --> 00:15:28.690
be free of partitions to work as an open plan work area. More importantly, as these

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:33.970
debountable partitions have no services in them, these changes can be made at any time before

00:15:34.769 --> 00:15:41.809
or after moving into the facility as office needs are better understood. Maximizing the glass on

00:15:41.809 --> 00:15:48.049
the facades and then the use of glass partitions inside the offices ensures that all offices have

00:15:48.049 --> 00:15:57.639
plenty of natural light. The 10 residence buildings are oriented in a north south direction

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:06.120
so that all rooms will have either morning or afternoon sun. They are clustered around existing

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:13.080
wetlands. Careful research led to the decision to pursue a different structural system

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:20.440
known as mass timber. Something we've not done on previous projects of this scale.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:28.200
Timber is bonded in crossed directional layers to form the structural elements of the building.

00:16:29.159 --> 00:16:36.440
This is an increasingly familiar system robust and safe that means that the beams, the columns and

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:44.120
floors can be prefabricated off-site, making the structure of the building faster to put up.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:52.840
And apart from being economical, time saving, and reducing the carbon footprint of the project,

00:16:53.559 --> 00:17:04.980
it should also make for some very attractive buildings. As many filming and recording projects

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:10.660
will be produced at the New Ramapo facility, 50 rooms in the residence building,

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:16.500
closest to the center of the site, have been designed to be smaller hotel-like rooms.

00:17:17.059 --> 00:17:24.019
That will allow for comfortable short-term stays for those here to assist as cast members or

00:17:24.019 --> 00:17:31.700
other visitors. As mentioned, many have worked from home during the pandemic, and some prefer it.

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:40.500
Will it be the wave of the future? We cannot say, however, the majority of the residence rooms

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:47.220
will have a separate room, many with a window that can be used either as an additional storage room

00:17:47.299 --> 00:17:54.500
or home office. Future updates will feature the central focus of this new facility,

00:17:55.140 --> 00:18:00.980
the new AVS studios building. Although it will be the biggest we have ever constructed,

00:18:01.779 --> 00:18:06.740
more importantly, it will bring what is presently done in many different areas,

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:12.180
and of course our hard work in brothers and sisters, all under one roof.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:20.420
Despite a number of challenges in 2020, the Ramapo project kept moving forward.

00:18:21.299 --> 00:18:29.220
As we look ahead, we eagerly await even further evidence that nothing Jehovah has in mind

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:49.200
is impossible for him to do. The amazing progress we're making with Ramapo, even in the middle of

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:56.000
such challenging circumstances, reminds us of Psalm 127 and verse 1.

00:18:57.519 --> 00:19:03.440
Unless Jehovah builds the house, it is in vain that its builders work hard on it.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:09.839
There's no doubt that Jehovah is helping us build the house at Ramapo.

00:19:10.799 --> 00:19:17.599
You may have noted that the video mentioned future updates, so in time you can look forward to more

00:19:17.599 --> 00:19:25.119
reports about the Ramapo project. When we reflect on all that's been accomplished this past year,

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:31.599
it's clear that Jehovah is blessing the self-sacrifice of our worldwide Bethel family.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:38.160
They're like the ones described at Psalm 110 and verse 3, where it says,

00:19:38.799 --> 00:19:48.319
Your people will offer themselves willingly. These brothers and sisters are truly offering themselves

00:19:48.319 --> 00:19:57.279
willingly to Jehovah day after day, so please keep the Bethel family and the Ramapo project in your

00:19:57.279 --> 00:20:04.559
prayers. We're confident that Jehovah will bless your hard work and your endurance during this

00:20:04.559 --> 00:20:12.000
pandemic, whether you're serving in Bethel or in the field. And we know you'll show the same

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:19.440
zeal during the campaign to invite as many as possible to the special talk and memorial of Christ

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:27.440
death. It's our earnest prayer that Jehovah continue to guide and strengthen you in the days ahead.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:38.799
