WEBVTT

00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:04.179
When was the last time you got discouraged?

00:00:04.179 --> 00:00:10.580
I think we've all experienced those low emotions when we feel like giving out or throwing

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.460
in the towel as we speak.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.960
Now we're not talking about serious depression, which is described by the in the October

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:26.000
2013 awake as something that is often ongoing and can interfere with our daily life.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.359
No discouragement is low points.

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.679
It's an emotion that can come on as quickly.

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:36.640
It can cause us to lose our zeal for spiritual activities.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:44.240
And it's brought on by a variety of factors, for example, unfulfilled expectations, criticism,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.960
personal failings, lack of results in the ministry.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.960
Now discouragement is not a sign of spiritual weakness.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.820
Many faithful ones in the Bible experienced discouragement.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.120
But it is something we have to take serious because of our scripture text highlight when

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.040
we're discouraged, our strength can be meager.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.000
Jehovah takes it serious when we're discouraged.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
How do we know that?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:25.920
Let's open our Bibles to Psalm 34 and notice what Jehovah does when you are discouraged.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.760
Psalm 34, look at verse 18, it says, Jehovah is close to the broken hearted.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:40.239
He saves those who are crushed in spirit, whereas a footnote brings out, are discouraged.

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:46.319
Yes, Jehovah gets close to us when we're discouraged, isn't that a beautiful thought

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:50.719
to think that Jehovah comes near to us to assist us because he loves us.

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:53.280
He draws close to us.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.480
Now why might he do that?

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.959
Why does he remind us that he's close by?

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:03.000
Well, one reason may be because when we're discouraged, we can feel like we've disappointed

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.039
Jehovah, or he's no longer with us, or we may feel slow to reach out and talk to him

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.080
in prayer.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:19.400
By Jehovah reminding us that he's close to us, it dispels that negative emotion.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.159
Another reason he may get close to us is because of what first Peter chapter 5 verse 8 says,

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:30.039
that Satan is like a roaring lion seeking to devour us.

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:32.199
Yes, he's on the attack.

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:39.680
Yes, when we get discouraged and our strength becomes meager, we can drop our guard.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.680
And like a literal lion, Satan looks to take advantage of those who are weak.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.599
Jehovah does not want us to give out.

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:56.080
And as a result, because of his love for us, he draws close to us.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.599
Now if Jehovah is close to us when we're discouraged, what can we do to reach out to

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:02.599
him?

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.199
Let's talk about three things that we can do.

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:11.280
One is our prayers, what to include in them, a two are Bible reading, how it can help

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.280
us, and three are association.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.080
So first of all, our prayers.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.599
We pray to Jehovah with confidence, knowing he hears our prayers, he acts on our behalf.

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:30.120
It's not just a feel good therapy for us, but we're talking to Jehovah, someone who loves

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.360
us and wants to rescue us.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.360
Now what might we include in our prayers?

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.639
Well, remember what Jesus encouraged us to do at Luke chapter 11, 9 through 13?

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.120
He said to ask for Holy Spirit.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.120
Why?

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.759
Because the Holy Spirit is given to us to comfort us, to strengthen us.

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:54.520
And evidently the Apostle Paul, when he was discouraged and moments of discouragement,

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.759
he asked for Holy Spirit.

00:03:56.759 --> 00:04:01.759
That's why at Philippians 4.13 he said, all things he's able to endure because of the one

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:04.199
who imparts power to him.

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:11.680
Yes, that Holy Spirit can renew our strength spiritually and emotionally when we ask for

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.000
it.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.439
And another thing we might want to include in our prayers is what's highlighted for us

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:24.759
in Psalm chapter 61, at Psalm 61.

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:30.600
And notice what was the Psalmist says in verse 2.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.680
Psalm 61 2, it says, from the ends of the earth, I will cry out to you, when my heart is

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.040
in despair.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.639
Lead me onto a rock that is higher than I am.

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:49.240
This week I can ask Jehovah to lead us to a rock that is higher than we are, to give

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.759
us that inner confidence that seems inaccessible by our own strength.

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:58.639
Isn't that what he did for Elijah?

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.240
You remember the account with Elijah?

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.060
He had the privilege as you see in the image there in the background of seeing Jehovah's

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.199
hand and defeating the bell prophets.

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:12.199
But then shortly afterwards he got discouraged because of a bad report he'd heard.

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:18.120
He felt alone and as a result he found himself pouring his heart out to Jehovah in prayer.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.639
How did Jehovah lead him to a rock that was higher than he was or give him that inner

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.639
confidence?

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.120
Would Jehovah change his perspective?

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:34.920
Jehovah reminded him that there was 7,000 others that had also stayed faithful to Jehovah.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.720
He was not alone.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.519
That strengthened Elijah.

00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:47.079
Yes, when we pray to Jehovah to help lead us to a rock higher than we are, he will do

00:05:47.079 --> 00:05:51.910
just as he did for Elijah for us.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:57.110
Another thing we can do is focus in on our Bible reading and we're discouraged.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.350
Now what verses do you find comforting when you have those low moments?

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.350
Many find encouragement from reading the Psalms.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:11.110
However, I might also want to consider the encouragement we're given at Hebrews chapter 12.

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:17.430
Notice what Hebrews chapter 12 says regarding running the race with endurance.

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:20.709
What can help us? Look at verse 2.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:27.189
Talking about running with endurance, says as we look intently at the chief agent

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:33.350
and perfect of our faith Jesus, for the joy that was set before him he endured a torture

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.629
stake, despising shame, and is sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:40.870
So we look intently at who?

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:43.029
The chief agent, Jesus.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:49.350
That term chief agent describes Jesus' essential role in helping humans.

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:54.310
And what will be the result when we stay focused on him?

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.509
Verse 3.

00:06:55.509 --> 00:06:59.990
Indeed, consider closely the one who has endured such hostile speech from sinners

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:05.029
against their own interests so that you may not get tired and give up.

00:07:07.079 --> 00:07:10.360
With that in mind, we could read the gospel accounts.

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:18.360
You see, when we read the gospels, we see the refreshment that comes from Jehovah and Jesus.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.680
And because Jesus is a perfect reflection of his father, we see Jehovah's love

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.959
as we read about the accounts where Jesus took care of the downtrodden, helped the lowly.

00:07:29.959 --> 00:07:35.160
The sermon on the mount as we read that it soothes us because it helps reset our priorities.

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:40.920
Yes, reading the gospel accounts keeps us focused on the chief agent, Jesus,

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.120
in helping us in times of discouragement.

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:52.519
Another way we can reach out to Jehovah in times of a discouragement is to put ourselves

00:07:52.519 --> 00:07:55.480
in association with our brothers and sisters.

00:07:56.199 --> 00:08:00.439
When we're associating with our brothers and sisters, Jehovah can move them

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.680
to help us, to strengthen us, and sometimes they're not even aware of it.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.560
Does he notice what association with our brothers and sisters can do?

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.879
We open our Bibles to Acts, chapter 28.

00:08:12.839 --> 00:08:16.199
And notice the effect it had on the Apostle Paul.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:25.000
He was in a low point, being in prison bonds, being transferred to another location,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.279
discouraged.

00:08:26.279 --> 00:08:30.519
And notice what Jehovah did for him in verse 15, Acts 28, verse 15.

00:08:31.399 --> 00:08:34.519
From there, the brothers, when they heard the news about us,

00:08:34.519 --> 00:08:39.320
came as far as the marketplace of apius and three taverns to meet us.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:46.279
And notice, on catching sight of them, Paul thanked God and took courage.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:54.360
Yes, just a sight of his brothers, brought Paul courage, gave him that inner strength

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.480
to not give up and to continue on.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.539
So in review, when we get discouraged from time to time,

00:09:05.539 --> 00:09:06.899
Jehovah understands that.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:11.299
He also understands that it's serious, that we give attention to it.

00:09:11.299 --> 00:09:16.259
And that's why he draws close to us, stands right next to us to help us not give up.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:21.460
And we can draw close to him through our prayers, asking for his Holy Spirit,

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.740
asking him to take us to a rock higher than we are.

00:09:25.299 --> 00:09:30.259
We can do so by our Bible reading, focusing in on the refreshment we get from the gospels.

00:09:31.059 --> 00:09:36.259
And finally, by putting ourselves in association with our brothers and sisters.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:42.419
Because when we feel like giving up, remember, Jehovah won't give up on us.

00:09:42.419 --> 00:09:47.620
He draws close to us because he loves us and he wants to help us.
