WEBVTT

00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:09.310
Our scripture here, Isaiah 64 verse 8, clearly establishes that Jehovah God is the potter,

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.070
the great potter in fact, and we are the clay.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.829
Now, in what way is he molding us?

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:24.309
Well one way is through adjusting our Christian personality.

00:00:24.309 --> 00:00:27.789
Now how does he do that?

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:37.189
Well he uses his word, the Bible, his Holy Spirit, and the Christian congregation.

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:43.070
So what we're going to do is to talk about how Jehovah helps to mold our personality.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.149
What's the process that's used?

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:53.189
We're going to talk about two aspects of the Christian personality, humility and kindness.

00:00:53.189 --> 00:01:01.030
So we said one way Jehovah uses to mold our personality as his word, the Bible.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:08.189
And Hebrews chapter 4 verse 12 says that God's word has tremendous power.

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:15.510
So we take individual scriptures as we are reading it, we look at our own personality.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.310
What does it say about me?

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.870
How can I improve?

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.790
Let's take an example of humility.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:29.950
We're going to go to Philippians chapter 2 verses 3 and 4.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.310
We see how this is a powerful aid to us.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.670
Here's what we should do, Philippians 2, 3 and 4.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.790
Do nothing out of contentiousness or out of egotism, but with humility consider others

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.109
superior to you.

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:55.030
As you look, not only for your own interests, but also for the interests of others.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:02.870
So when we read the scripture, we look at ourselves and say, well, how am I doing in this?

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.789
Do I see that I have made progress, especially if this has been an issue in the past?

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:17.430
Is Jehovah somehow nudging me, adjusting me, molding me by means of this powerful scripture?

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.110
Ask ourselves, humility, am I the person that always seems to be in charge?

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.310
Do I give across that attitude to others?

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:36.870
Or as it says here, do I view others as superior, maybe even saying, I admit that that sister

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.509
has more patience than I have, or that brother is really a better teacher than I am.

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:50.469
So you see by the means of individual scriptures, Jehovah God can help to mold our thinking.

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:58.550
Now in addition to the individual scripture, the Bible also provides examples of that

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.030
quality in action.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:08.629
And so the Watchtower comment for today uses Christ Jesus as an example in humility.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.270
Let's open to that scripture.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.830
It's referred to as Luke chapter 22.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.189
And as we read the account, we think, you know, what can I learn?

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:21.110
How did he handle it?

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.870
How can I apply it?

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.310
So 22, 24, does took place the evening before his death.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.590
It says, however, there also arose a heated dispute among them over which one of them was considered

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.870
to be the greatest.

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:38.389
Well, automatically we see there's a problem of humility here.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.030
Well, so let's move down now to verses 26 and 27.

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:52.629
He says, you though, are not to be that way, but let the one who is the greatest among you

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:59.349
become as the youngest and the one taking the lead as the one ministering for which one is

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:00.349
greater.

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.990
The one dining or the one serving.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.909
Is it not the one dining?

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:12.629
But I am among you as the one serving.

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:17.870
Now these were not just words because the apostles had seen three and a half years of

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.389
beautiful example of Jesus serving others, truly a humble man.

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:29.310
And through our Bible reading too, we've seen this example of humility that we can apply

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:36.029
so it's good for us to ask ourselves, am I a proud person?

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:40.110
Do I give off that impression to others?

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:48.910
Do I view myself as one dining or as one serving?

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:56.430
Well, another way that Jehovah uses to mold our Christian personality is the Holy Spirit.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.110
Now how does that work?

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:05.069
If you look at Galatians chapter 5, in verse 19, it talks about the works of the flesh.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.230
And then in verse 22, it refers to the fruitage of the Spirit.

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.069
Work to the flesh, fruitage of the Spirit.

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:21.069
Now work, work, it's a result of what one does.

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:23.949
It's the product of your actions.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:32.110
And so the Apostle Paul list, as you see there under works of the flesh, various results

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:39.149
that come as a result of a conscious effort on an individual's part are possibly because of

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:40.750
human imperfection.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:47.310
But on the other hand, Paul talks about the fruitage of the Spirit, not work, but the fruitage

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.589
it results in.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:54.990
And this is implying that qualities that are listed there as fruitage of the Spirit

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:00.670
are not the result of some sort of program we get into to adjust our character.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:07.470
But it's the operation of God's Spirit upon the individual.

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:15.069
It's this tremendous force and power from Jehovah God that moves us in certain ways,

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:18.829
it may be to recognize Scripture, to listen to counsel.

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:26.990
Yes, we need to pray for his Holy Spirit so we can develop those Christian qualities that Paul

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:32.269
mentions. So when you look at verse 22, one of those qualities is kindness.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.350
How important is that for the Christian personality?

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:44.589
So when the great potter looks at us, does he see a need for adjustments in the way

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:49.470
we display kindness to others? So are we praying to Jehovah God?

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:54.269
Please, Jehovah, help me develop this fruitage of the Spirit.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:03.230
Here again, the Bible gives examples of individuals that had kindness.

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.870
It's the quality and action, so to speak.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:10.029
And in this case, Jehovah God, of course, is the greatest example.

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:16.750
Here it is. In Genesis chapter 3, it describes in verse 7 that after Adam and Eve ate the fruit,

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:22.350
then they recognize their nakedness. So what do they do? They sew fig leaves together as clothing.

00:07:23.149 --> 00:07:29.709
But now in verse 21, before putting them out of the garden of Eden into the thorns and

00:07:29.709 --> 00:07:37.389
thistles, what did Jehovah do? What says he made long garments out of skin to clothe them?

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:44.509
Now that's the ultimate of kindness. See, we want to allow these examples

00:07:44.509 --> 00:07:49.949
to touch us in ways that moves us to be kind to others.

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:56.029
Now, one benefit of kindness is that people are drawn to that kind of person.

00:07:57.149 --> 00:07:59.790
A Proverbs 11 verse 17 says this,

00:08:00.509 --> 00:08:04.029
a kind man benefits himself.

00:08:05.709 --> 00:08:14.350
It's enjoyable being around a kind person, isn't it? A kind person easily finds and keeps

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:23.389
good friends. Now the ministry of school textbook says that one who is kind and mild tempered

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:32.590
is gentle in his way of doing things. Now under the chapter voice quality, here's what it says,

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:41.149
people are greatly influenced by not only by what is said, but also by how it is said.

00:08:42.029 --> 00:08:48.269
If a person speaking to you has a voice that is pleasant, warm, friendly and kind,

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:54.429
is it not true that you're more inclined to listen favorably? Most certainly it is.

00:08:55.230 --> 00:09:00.669
And I might say the November study edition of the Watchtower, we just received,

00:09:00.669 --> 00:09:08.190
has a beautiful article in it entitled Kindness, a quality expressed in word and action.

00:09:09.789 --> 00:09:15.870
So when it comes to our Christian personality, especially involving humility and kindness,

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:23.629
as we've talked about today, may each of us respond to the molding of Jehovah God. He uses his

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:31.149
word, the Bible, and he uses his Holy Spirit. Now we also said, Jehovah uses the congregation.

00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:39.629
So may we all be responsive to counsel that we receive either from the platform or maybe

00:09:39.629 --> 00:09:48.990
individual counsel to improve in these areas. And if we respond correctly, then we can say,

00:09:48.990 --> 00:10:00.269
as recorded in Isaiah 64, 8, but now, O Jehovah, you are our Father, we are the clay, and you are our

00:10:00.269 --> 00:10:10.429
Father, we are all the work of your hand.
