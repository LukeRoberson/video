00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.940
Greetings and welcome to J.W. Broadcasting.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.939
We have an exciting program in store for you.

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:13.939
We'll learn how Jehovah has revealed his sacred secret

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:16.940
and what it means for each of us.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.940
We'll see a dramatization that will help us stay focused on serving Jehovah

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.940
and avoid becoming overly concerned with when the end will come.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.940
In this new episode of our history and motion,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.939
we'll learn how Jehovah's Organization has harnessed motion picture technology

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:36.939
to preach and teach.

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:40.939
And we'll enjoy a thought-provoking music video with a timely message

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:44.939
we're happier when we keep it simple.

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:49.939
This is J.W. Broadcasting for August 2024.

00:00:49.939 --> 00:01:11.079
Do you like mysteries or puzzles?

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:13.079
What about secrets?

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:18.079
Are you good at keeping honorable secrets confidential?

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:23.079
Jehovah had a secret that he kept for about 4,000 years.

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:28.079
Unlike human secrets which often are difficult to keep confidential,

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:33.079
Jehovah's sacred secret would be revealed only by divine revelation.

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:39.079
In other words, Jehovah would reveal the details only in his due time.

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.079
Proverbs 25 verse 2 says,

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:47.079
It is the glory of God to keep a matter secret.

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:50.079
What's the secret we're talking about?

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.079
It's related to the first prophecy recorded in the Bible,

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:57.079
found at Genesis chapter 3 verse 15.

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:03.079
How would Jehovah fix the damage caused by the rebellion in the Garden of Eden?

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:07.079
Jehovah said to the serpent who deceived Eve,

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:13.080
and I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and her offspring.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.080
He will crush your head and you will strike him in the heel.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.080
What an intriguing prophecy.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.080
It was spoken some 6,000 years ago,

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.080
but its meaning affects each one of us,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.080
and every person who has ever lived.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.080
Who was behind the voice of the serpent?

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.080
Who was the woman?

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.080
Eve might have thought that she was,

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.080
because when she later gave birth to Cain,

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.080
she said at Genesis 4 verse 1,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.080
I have produced a male child with the help of Jehovah.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.080
But Eve was not the woman of the prophecy.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.080
Jehovah's secret was still a secret.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.080
Who was the offspring of the woman?

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.080
If Eve thought it was Cain, she was sadly disappointed.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.080
Jehovah would reveal these details according to his timetable,

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.080
long after Adam and Eve died.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.080
We might compare the revealing of Jehovah's sacred secret to this puzzle box.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.080
It's locked and seems impossible to open.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.080
However, a series of steps leads to opening the box

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.080
and revealing the treasure inside.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.080
Those steps are like the details that led to identifying

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.080
the promised offspring of the woman.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.080
What were some of those details?

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.080
Over 2,000 years after the prophecy in Eden,

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.080
Jehovah made a promise to the faithful man Abraham

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.080
that provided a piece of the puzzle.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.080
What did Jehovah say?

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.080
We find his words at Genesis 22 verses 17 and 18.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.080
I will surely bless you and I will surely multiply your offspring

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.080
like the stars of the heavens and like the grains of sand on the seashore.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.080
And your offspring will take possession of the gate of his enemies.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.080
And by means of your offspring, all nations of the earth

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.079
will obtain a blessing for themselves.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.079
Wow!

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:27.939
Jehovah revealed the first detail to unlock his sacred secret.

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:30.939
Abraham must have been amazed when he looked up to the heavens

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:34.939
and saw thousands of stars.

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:38.939
Although Abraham would not see the complete fulfillment of the promise

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:43.939
in his lifetime, it certainly would be fulfilled at a future time

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:46.939
by the God who does not lie.

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:50.939
Jehovah repeated the promise to Abraham's son Isaac

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:53.939
and to Isaac's son Jacob.

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:57.939
Jacob in his deathbed prophecy said at Genesis 49-10

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:02.939
that the scepter would not depart from Judah.

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:05.939
So we learn that kingship is involved

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:10.939
and that the promised offspring would come through Judah's line.

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:13.939
Later, Jehovah provided the mosaic law

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:16.939
to help protect the nation of Israel

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:19.939
and the promised offspring.

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:24.939
What was the next significant detail to be revealed?

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:31.939
In 1070 BCE, Judah's descendant David became king over all Israel.

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:35.939
David was a man agreeable to Jehovah's heart.

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:39.939
And Jehovah promised to raise up someone in David's royal line

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:41.939
who would rule forever.

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:47.939
The promise is recorded at 2 Samuel 7 verses 12 and 13.

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:51.939
I will raise up your offspring after you, your own son,

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:55.939
and I will firmly establish his kingdom.

00:05:55.939 --> 00:06:00.939
I will firmly establish the throne of his kingdom forever,

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:04.939
where one step closer to identifying the promised offspring,

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:13.899
the offspring would come through David's line.

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:16.899
Although David's son Solomon had a peaceful reign,

00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:20.899
he was not the king who would rule forever.

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:25.899
That king would appear in the future at Jehovah's appointed time.

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:29.899
Of course, the devil didn't want the promised offspring of the woman to appear,

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:32.899
so he repeatedly tried to eliminate

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:36.899
or contaminate the lineage to the offspring.

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:40.899
However, Jehovah made sure that the devil failed in his attempts.

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:44.720
Down through the centuries,

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.720
Jehovah through his prophets provided specific details

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.720
regarding the promised offspring.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:56.720
For instance, the prophet Micah foretold that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.720
Daniel's prophecy of the 70 weeks of years indicated the exact year

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.720
when the Messiah would appear.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:10.720
Also, Isaiah's prophecy revealed that the offspring would die a sacrificial death.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:17.720
Jehovah was progressively revealing details about his sacred secret.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.720
In centuries later, in the year 2 BCE,

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.720
the angel Gabriel appeared to a Jewish virgin named Mary

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.720
and made a startling declaration to her.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.720
Would you like to know what it is?

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.720
It's found at Luke chapter 1 verses 31 through 33.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.720
Look, you will become pregnant and give birth to a son,

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.720
and you are to name him Jesus.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.720
This one will be great,

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.720
and will be called son of the most high,

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:52.720
and Jehovah God will give him the throne of David his father,

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.720
and he will rule as king over the house of Jacob forever,

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:01.720
and there will be no end to his kingdom.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:07.720
Both Mary and Jesus' adoptive father Joseph were descendants of David,

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:15.720
so Jesus received both the natural and the legal rights of an heir of David.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.720
Can you imagine what might have been going through Mary's mind

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.720
after hearing those words?

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.720
Did she perhaps remember hearing similar details

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.720
from the book of Moses about the promised offspring?

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.720
Of course, about nine months later, when Jesus was born,

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.720
Jehovah's angel appeared to shepherds

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.720
who were tending their flocks near Bethlehem.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.720
The angel announced, as recorded in Luke chapter 2,

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.720
today there was born to you in David's city, a savior,

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.720
who was Christ the Lord.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.720
After thousands of years,

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.720
Jehovah was giving notice that his sacred secret

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.720
would soon be revealed.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.720
The shepherds went and told Mary and Joseph

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.720
about this divine message.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.720
The word about the Christ was spreading.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.720
About thirty years later,

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.720
in the days of John the baptizer,

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.720
the people were in expectation,

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.720
and all of them were reasoning in their hearts about John,

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.720
may he perhaps be the Christ?

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.720
A short time later,

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.720
Jesus the Nazarene came to John to be baptized.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.720
After Jesus came up out of the water,

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.720
Jehovah anointed him with Holy Spirit and said,

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.720
this is my son, the beloved.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.720
At long last,

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:53.870
the promised offspring of Genesis 315 had arrived.

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:58.870
Humble Jews readily responded to Jesus' teachings in ministry,

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:01.870
but there were many more details about the sacred secret

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.870
yet to be revealed,

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:07.870
like the many facets of a beautiful crystal.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:16.159
During his ministry, Jesus himself identified the serpent,

00:10:16.159 --> 00:10:18.159
as Satan,

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:20.159
and the serpent's offspring

00:10:20.159 --> 00:10:24.159
as those who display the devil's characteristics.

00:10:24.159 --> 00:10:30.159
Jesus also revealed, as recorded in Luke 22 verses 28 through 30,

00:10:30.159 --> 00:10:34.159
that there would be a secondary part of the woman's offspring.

00:10:34.159 --> 00:10:39.159
Spirit anointed Christians who will rule with Christ in heaven.

00:10:39.159 --> 00:10:43.159
Later, the Apostle Paul identified the woman of the prophecy

00:10:43.159 --> 00:10:46.159
as the heavenly part of Jehovah's organization

00:10:46.159 --> 00:10:50.159
made up of faithful spirit creatures.

00:10:50.159 --> 00:10:55.159
Of course, the enmity for told at Genesis 3 verse 15 continues

00:10:55.159 --> 00:10:57.159
into our day.

00:10:57.159 --> 00:11:00.159
The devil and his offspring continued to wage war

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:04.159
with the remaining ones of the woman's offspring on earth.

00:11:04.159 --> 00:11:09.159
But what did the Messiah accomplish while he was on the earth?

00:11:09.159 --> 00:11:12.159
The Jews were hoping that he would bring liberation

00:11:12.159 --> 00:11:14.159
from Roman oppression.

00:11:14.159 --> 00:11:17.159
However, Daniel's prophecy indicated that the Messiah

00:11:17.159 --> 00:11:20.159
would be cut off or put to death.

00:11:20.159 --> 00:11:23.159
This corresponded to the striking in the heel mentioned

00:11:23.159 --> 00:11:26.159
at Genesis 3 verse 15.

00:11:26.159 --> 00:11:31.159
Still, Jehovah also revealed at Psalm 16 verse 10 that his son

00:11:31.159 --> 00:11:34.159
would not be left in the grave.

00:11:34.159 --> 00:11:37.159
True to his promise, Jehovah resurrected Jesus

00:11:37.159 --> 00:11:41.159
less than three days after his death.

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:45.159
Of course, a principal part of Jehovah's sacred secret

00:11:45.159 --> 00:11:50.159
involved the Messianic kingdom of which Christ would be king.

00:11:50.159 --> 00:11:54.159
While Jesus was on earth, he cured the sick.

00:11:54.159 --> 00:11:57.159
He fed the hungry and resurrected the dead,

00:11:57.159 --> 00:12:03.159
things that will do on a far greater scale as king of God's kingdom.

00:12:03.159 --> 00:12:07.159
After Jesus ascended to heaven, many additional details

00:12:07.159 --> 00:12:10.159
about God's sacred secret were revealed in the writings

00:12:10.159 --> 00:12:13.159
we now know as the Christian Greek scriptures.

00:12:13.159 --> 00:12:16.159
Colossians 2 verse 3 says,

00:12:16.159 --> 00:12:19.159
carefully concealed in him or Christ

00:12:19.159 --> 00:12:23.159
are all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge.

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:27.159
When did the sacred secret come to its finish?

00:12:27.159 --> 00:12:31.159
Revelation 10 verse 7 says that it would occur in the days

00:12:31.159 --> 00:12:35.159
when the seventh angel is about to blow his trumpet.

00:12:35.159 --> 00:12:37.159
When did that take place?

00:12:37.159 --> 00:12:42.159
Let's note the answer at Revelation 11 verse 15.

00:12:42.159 --> 00:12:45.159
The seventh angel blew his trumpet

00:12:45.159 --> 00:12:48.159
and there were loud voices in heaven saying,

00:12:48.159 --> 00:12:51.159
the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord

00:12:51.159 --> 00:12:56.159
and of his Christ and he will rule as king forever and ever.

00:12:56.159 --> 00:13:03.159
This occurred in 1914 when Christ Jesus became king of God's kingdom.

00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:06.159
But is that the end?

00:13:06.159 --> 00:13:08.159
No.

00:13:08.159 --> 00:13:12.159
The revelation provides additional details regarding God's kingdom

00:13:12.159 --> 00:13:17.159
and future events that most people would consider shocking.

00:13:17.159 --> 00:13:21.159
For example, Revelation 19 verses 11 through 16

00:13:21.159 --> 00:13:25.159
reveals that Christ Jesus, the king of kings and Lord of lords,

00:13:25.159 --> 00:13:31.159
will strike the nations and shepherd them with a rod of iron

00:13:31.159 --> 00:13:35.159
as king of God's kingdom Jesus will soon crush

00:13:35.159 --> 00:13:41.159
all human governments and hurl the devil into an abyss of inactivity.

00:13:41.159 --> 00:13:46.159
This will lead to 1,000 years of peace.

00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:49.159
At the end of the thousand years,

00:13:49.159 --> 00:13:53.159
the devil will be released from the abyss for a short time

00:13:53.159 --> 00:13:58.159
and then the final fulfillment of Genesis 3 verse 15 will occur.

00:13:58.159 --> 00:14:04.950
The offspring of the woman will crush the head of the devil.

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:06.950
How does all of this affect us?

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:12.330
We're privileged to know about God's sacred secret,

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:17.330
which he kept secret for some 4,000 years.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:20.330
Some of the details Jehovah has helped his people to understand

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:22.330
only in recent decades.

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:28.330
Yes, Jehovah has made known to us the sacred secret of his will.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:33.639
During this broadcast, we have considered only a few facets

00:14:33.639 --> 00:14:35.639
of God's sacred secret.

00:14:35.639 --> 00:14:40.639
Why not make it a project for personal or family worship?

00:14:40.639 --> 00:14:43.639
It's thrilling to think about kingdom realities

00:14:43.639 --> 00:14:48.639
and how Jehovah will completely undo the effects of Satan's rebellion.

00:14:48.639 --> 00:14:52.639
Christ Jesus now rules as king in the heavens

00:14:52.639 --> 00:14:57.639
and the days for this evil system of things under Satan's domination are numbered.

00:14:58.639 --> 00:15:02.639
Jesus will soon strike the nations with the rod of iron

00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:08.049
and then transform the earth into a beautiful paradise.

00:15:08.049 --> 00:15:12.049
What does Jehovah want us to do with his sacred secret?

00:15:12.049 --> 00:15:15.049
Should we put it back into the box?

00:15:15.049 --> 00:15:18.049
Buried in the ground?

00:15:18.049 --> 00:15:19.049
No!

00:15:19.049 --> 00:15:22.049
Jehovah wants us to make it known!

00:15:22.049 --> 00:15:27.049
The sacred secret is now being proclaimed in over 1,000 languages.

00:15:27.049 --> 00:15:31.049
Are you having a full share?

00:15:31.049 --> 00:15:34.049
Deep appreciation for this sacred secret

00:15:34.049 --> 00:15:37.049
and all that it means for the future will impell us to share it

00:15:37.049 --> 00:15:40.049
with as many people as possible.

00:15:40.049 --> 00:15:44.049
When the Apostle Paul wrote to Christians in Ephesus,

00:15:44.049 --> 00:15:49.049
he requested of them as recorded at Ephesians 6 verse 19.

00:15:49.049 --> 00:15:55.049
Pray also for me that the words may be given to me when I open my mouth

00:15:55.049 --> 00:16:02.049
so that I may be able to speak boldly and making known the sacred secret of the good news.

00:16:02.049 --> 00:16:06.049
That's our prayer for you, dear brothers and sisters,

00:16:06.049 --> 00:16:13.549
that we all may continue to declare Jehovah's sacred secret with boldness.

00:16:13.549 --> 00:16:16.549
One way we reach many people with the good news

00:16:16.549 --> 00:16:20.549
is through special preaching campaigns organized by the branch office.

00:16:20.549 --> 00:16:25.549
In the following report, we'll see how Jehovah has blessed this work.

00:16:25.549 --> 00:16:31.409
I love to preach, I love to talk about Jehovah.

00:16:31.409 --> 00:16:36.409
Whenever I'd read the experiences of pioneers and missionaries in the earbooks,

00:16:36.409 --> 00:16:40.409
I wanted to feel the same joy and the same feeling that they had.

00:16:40.409 --> 00:16:46.409
When I heard about the announcement about the campaign, I knew that that was my chance.

00:16:46.409 --> 00:16:49.409
The first challenge was the pressure I got from others.

00:16:49.409 --> 00:16:51.409
Why go so far?

00:16:51.409 --> 00:16:54.409
You could use that money to travel somewhere more beautiful.

00:16:54.409 --> 00:16:57.409
You could even travel to another country.

00:16:57.409 --> 00:17:01.409
These types of comments did affect me a bit.

00:17:01.409 --> 00:17:04.410
Other times it was more a question of finances.

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:10.410
I once had to decide whether I would accept an opportunity to work at a good job in the public sector

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:16.960
or whether to turn that opportunity down.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:21.960
But participating in that campaign was my chance to do more for Jehovah.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.960
I knew this experience would be life-changing.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:28.960
Throughout the campaign, we met so many sincere people,

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:34.960
some who had never heard Jehovah's name or who didn't even know what Bible was.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:39.960
One experience that stuck with me was when I tried explaining to someone what the Bible was.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:18:02.190
And then her eyes just beamed when she understood that it was a message from God to her personally.

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:05.190
There's a Bible student who is indigenous.

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:09.190
And whenever you talk about Jehovah, her eyes always light up.

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:13.190
She always asks to learn more about Jehovah.

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:19.190
We would study over the public telephone because she lives in a village that's about five days journey away.

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:23.190
But even though it was challenging, she made it to the meetings.

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:28.190
She would bring the whole family, sometimes up to 20 people, would walk into the Kingdom Hall.

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:34.190
I would bring a Bible, a phone and a tablet, and I would pass them around and try to help them.

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:38.190
There's no doubt that having these experiences was well worth it.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:42.190
I know that participating in this campaign was the best decision.

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:47.190
I started to truly see Jehovah as a real friend.

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:52.190
And it was also wonderful to spend time with a variety of brothers and sisters during the campaign.

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:55.190
It helped me mature spiritually.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:19:00.190
I planned to go for a month and ended up staying there for five years.

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:08.309
If I could, I'd do it all over again.

00:19:08.309 --> 00:19:14.309
My family owns a guest house, and my father said that we were going to host a group for a campaign.

00:19:14.309 --> 00:19:22.339
But I never had contact with Jehovah's Witnesses before.

00:19:22.339 --> 00:19:31.339
When the group arrived, the pastor of my church said that I should be very careful about having contact with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:19:31.339 --> 00:19:38.970
So I was. I did everything I could to avoid contact with them.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:41.970
I would see them leaving early for the ministry.

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:45.970
But one day, there was a sister that didn't go out.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:51.599
And I thought she's going to try to preach to me.

00:19:51.599 --> 00:19:56.130
And that's what she did.

00:19:56.130 --> 00:20:00.130
So since she was already staying at the end, I started studying with her.

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:03.130
But at first, it was just to prove her wrong.

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:10.730
As I kept studying, though, I could see that what I was learning was really making sense.

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:15.730
So I couldn't say that that wasn't the truth.

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:24.059
I would also notice the brothers and sisters playing guitar, singing.

00:20:24.059 --> 00:20:30.059
And I thought it was so beautiful to see how joyful they always were.

00:20:30.059 --> 00:20:33.059
I met the witnesses in April 2016.

00:20:33.059 --> 00:20:37.059
And in October, I became an unbaptized publisher.

00:20:37.059 --> 00:20:40.059
In January 2017, I was baptized.

00:20:40.059 --> 00:20:43.059
And I've been regular pioneering for two years.

00:20:43.059 --> 00:20:49.059
I'm sure that all of this happened because Jehovah heard what I prayed for a few days before.

00:20:49.059 --> 00:20:55.059
I had had to go to the hospital and I had asked God, help me survive.

00:20:55.059 --> 00:21:00.059
So that I can get to know you because I know I don't know the truth about you yet.

00:21:00.059 --> 00:21:03.059
He gave me what I asked for.

00:21:03.059 --> 00:21:06.059
He sent the brothers just at the right time with the campaign.

00:21:06.059 --> 00:21:08.059
I'm sure it was Jehovah who sent them.

00:21:08.059 --> 00:21:13.059
Someone could be praying for help to learn about Jehovah.

00:21:13.059 --> 00:21:21.059
And he would direct a preaching campaign with brothers from many places to help honest-hearted people.

00:21:21.059 --> 00:21:29.519
Some seeds of truth we plant may take root unexpectedly.

00:21:29.519 --> 00:21:38.519
By sharing zealously in the preaching work, you could be the one who helps someone hear the truth for the very first time.

00:21:38.519 --> 00:21:43.519
Learning about Jehovah can be the turning point in a person's life.

00:21:43.519 --> 00:21:46.519
We'll see an example of this in the following interview.

00:21:46.519 --> 00:21:53.910
I hated the world situation. There was so much suffering.

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:57.910
And I always had so many questions. Why are we here?

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:00.910
What is it all about? What is the purpose?

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:05.910
Is there really a God? Is there, could He allow all of this?

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:10.910
So I opened the window and I stuck my head out and I said,

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:15.910
if you're there, I want you to know how I feel about you.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:19.910
I was raised in a religious Jewish family in the Bronx.

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:24.910
My parents viewed money as security and they worked seven days a week.

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:28.910
That really affected us as children a lot.

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:32.910
I was a child let on the loose. I was running the streets.

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:40.910
And so I started using drugs and I started selling drugs and I was getting in every kind of trouble.

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:45.910
And so they moved us out to Long Island hoping things would be better.

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:50.910
But I would take a taxi back into New York City every day.

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:57.910
But one of the drivers was named Joe and we hit it off and I wound up marrying him.

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:02.910
My father was so, so upset. I married. I'm pregnant.

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:09.910
I said to him, I'm moving out and he said to me, don't look back because this is final.

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:17.910
So my family had disowned me. I was a new mother with a baby and I was really hurting.

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:24.910
So I remember one day looking out the window and seeing this little old man come up my stairs.

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:30.910
And he was carrying a little blue book. And he came to my door and he went to 25 cents for that book.

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:33.910
The truth that leads to eternal life.

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:38.910
And I didn't really care about the book but something made me want to give that little old man that quarter.

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:42.910
Right away chapter four caught my attention why we grow old and die.

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:46.910
And I read the entire chapter and I thought it just made sense.

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:50.910
I can't wait to share this with Joe when he comes home.

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:54.910
He just lost his temper. He went out of control.

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:57.910
He did not want to hear about Joe's witnesses.

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:00.910
This is not that important. This book was really not that important.

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:06.910
I didn't want it to begin with. And so I just dropped it in the trash can and thought, that's the end of that. It's gone.

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:12.910
But that little old man came back with a young sister and Joe was there cutting an orange with a knife.

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:15.910
And he was not happy to see those people again.

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:19.910
He took that knife and he waved it in front of the sister's face.

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:22.910
And he said, I don't want you here at the house.

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:25.910
She ran to the door and she said, no problem.

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:27.910
I will definitely not be back.

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:32.910
And they left. And I thought, I really don't think they'll be back.

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:34.910
But they did come back.

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:37.910
An elderly sister who had a Jewish background.

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:43.910
And I said to her, can you not take a hint that I am not interested in speaking with you?

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:46.910
And she said, I get that. I get that.

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:50.910
But I really would love to ask you just one question.

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:56.910
I thought, okay, there's no harm in letting her ask me one question.

00:24:56.910 --> 00:25:04.910
She opened up the Green Bible to the cover page where it has the tetragrammaton Jehovah's name in Hebrew.

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:08.910
And she said, will you just say this name for me?

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:11.910
I thought to myself, I'm not going to say that name.

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:15.910
Jewish people don't say that name. I have never, ever said that name.

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:20.910
But finally, I did. I said Yehovah.

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:24.910
For the very first time, I said the name Jehovah.

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:30.910
And I was like, so shocked, you know, I was just waiting for something terrible to happen.

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:37.910
And then she told me that the name Jehovah was in the Bible about 7,000 times.

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:42.910
As soon as she left, I went and got out my Hebrew Bible.

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:47.910
And I was going to look for that name, Jehovah, and circle it if it was there.

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:54.910
So I started to do that. I went through the first page of the second page and I realized as I flipped through the Bible,

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:57.910
it's everywhere. The name Jehovah was everywhere.

00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:00.910
I thought, I have got to share this with Joe.

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:06.910
And Joe was really impressed. He was really softening. It made a difference.

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:14.910
A week later, she comes back because she wanted to show me a prophecy in the Hebrew Scriptures in Daniel chapter 9.

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:18.910
She called it the 70 weeks of year's prophecy.

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:26.910
And for the first time, I could see that there was a real answer to when the Messiah would come and what would be the results on the earth.

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:32.859
Seeing those prophecies really motivated me to want to know more.

00:26:32.859 --> 00:26:42.859
I thought to myself, if all of these prophecies are from God and he's fulfilling all of them, what other prophecies are there?

00:26:42.859 --> 00:26:46.859
What other wonderful things do we have to look forward to?

00:26:46.859 --> 00:26:53.210
My relationship with Jehovah just got better and better.

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:59.210
And we were baptized together on December 2nd, 1972.

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:03.210
I came to really appreciate and love Bible prophecy.

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:07.210
I started doing a lot of research and a lot of study on my own.

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:13.210
I loved getting to know Jehovah as a person who wants such good things for us.

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:18.210
Everything he wants, everything he asks of us is for our benefit.

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:24.259
It just really touched me to the core.

00:27:24.259 --> 00:27:28.259
My life is so full now with blessings from Jehovah.

00:27:28.259 --> 00:27:39.819
I love that name. There's no more beautiful name in the world than Jehovah.

00:27:39.819 --> 00:27:45.819
In these distressing times, people often look to money or human organizations.

00:27:45.819 --> 00:27:48.819
Almost anywhere for security.

00:27:48.819 --> 00:27:55.819
Sister Cologne's experience reassures us that Jehovah is the only secure refuge.

00:27:55.819 --> 00:28:00.819
He continues to stabilize and protect her spiritually.

00:28:00.819 --> 00:28:06.819
Jehovah's Witnesses have helped millions of people to learn the truth through a variety of methods,

00:28:06.819 --> 00:28:10.819
including, of course, this channel, JW Broadcasting.

00:28:10.819 --> 00:28:16.819
Today, we use videos in our preaching, meetings, schools and conventions.

00:28:16.819 --> 00:28:23.819
But did you know that Jehovah's Organization first used motion pictures more than 100 years ago?

00:28:23.819 --> 00:28:33.890
This episode of our history and motion traces that rich history. Let's watch!

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:40.890
Today, we use videos just about everywhere in our worship and ministry.

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:47.890
But did you know that Jehovah's People started using film and video to preach and teach more than 100 years ago?

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:56.420
Let's see how and why in this episode of Our History and Motion.

00:28:56.420 --> 00:29:04.660
When the early Bible students first began preaching in the late 1800s,

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:08.660
the motion picture industry was in its infancy.

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:15.660
But even then, CT Russell and his associates recognized the power of this new medium.

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:22.660
Film could be used not only to reach wider audiences, but to touch hearts with Bible truth.

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:32.630
At a convention in June 1913, the Bible students passed a bold resolution,

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:39.630
supporting the use of motion pictures as a new tool for preaching and teaching.

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:47.630
Less than a year later, in January 1914, the brothers debuted the photo drama of creation.

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:53.630
The eight-hour production included color slides and motion picture film,

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:58.630
most of it footage that Russell purchased from other studios.

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:05.630
Imagine sitting in a packed auditorium and seeing, possibly for the first time,

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:12.799
moving pictures of events described in the Bible.

00:30:12.799 --> 00:30:17.799
And there was something else in the photo drama that really took audiences by surprise.

00:30:17.799 --> 00:30:24.799
The photo drama of creation is presented by the ICSA,

00:30:24.799 --> 00:30:28.799
the International Bible Student Association.

00:30:28.799 --> 00:30:31.799
Synchronized dialogue.

00:30:31.799 --> 00:30:36.799
The photo drama played in theaters and auditoriums around the world.

00:30:36.799 --> 00:30:42.799
But what if film could be used to teach the truth not just in big theaters,

00:30:42.799 --> 00:30:46.799
but right in a person's own living room?

00:30:46.799 --> 00:30:51.799
That was the idea behind a series of short films released in the 1920s.

00:30:51.799 --> 00:30:57.799
These silent films, chronicling the travels of JF Rutherford in the Bible lands,

00:30:57.799 --> 00:31:01.799
were designed to be shown at home.

00:31:01.799 --> 00:31:05.799
They required the use of the Kenamo projection machine,

00:31:05.799 --> 00:31:10.799
a portable, low-cost movie projector made just for this purpose.

00:31:10.799 --> 00:31:15.799
Interested ones who viewed these films were given a glimpse of the Bible lands

00:31:15.799 --> 00:31:19.799
and were introduced to many prophecies.

00:31:19.799 --> 00:31:24.799
Over the next two decades, the organization used radio and the phonograph

00:31:24.799 --> 00:31:29.799
rather than film to reach more people with the Kingdom message.

00:31:29.799 --> 00:31:34.799
But in the 1950s, the governing body recognized the need for interested ones

00:31:34.799 --> 00:31:39.799
to see for themselves the international scope of the organization.

00:31:39.799 --> 00:31:46.799
So they again turned to film with the release of the New World Society in Action.

00:31:46.799 --> 00:31:52.799
This one-hour and 20-minute film transported viewers to our Bethel facilities

00:31:52.799 --> 00:31:55.799
and international conventions.

00:31:55.799 --> 00:32:03.779
It gave them a taste of what it's like to preach in some of the remotest parts of the world.

00:32:03.779 --> 00:32:07.779
Additional films released over the next several years,

00:32:07.779 --> 00:32:13.779
further highlighted the work of God's people and the fulfillment of Bible prophecies.

00:32:13.779 --> 00:32:18.779
Then, in 1966, we released Heritage.

00:32:18.779 --> 00:32:27.779
This 28-minute feature was unflinching in its portrayal of the real world problems young people face.

00:32:27.779 --> 00:32:35.500
Within the next 60 seconds, another family somewhere in the United States

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.500
would be strained to the breaking point.

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.500
What's this? Just a family quarrel?

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:45.500
No, it is far more serious than that.

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:48.500
What is it doing to this family?

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:53.500
Following Bible principles builds a solid family foundation.

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:58.500
Heritage was presented at circuit assemblies and other large gatherings.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:05.500
It was also shown on more than 150 television stations in the United States.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:10.500
After 1966, the organization shifted away from film

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:15.500
and began presenting modern and biblical dramas live on stage at conventions.

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:19.500
These dramas brought Bible accounts to life for young and old

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:24.500
and were one of the highlights of large conventions for many years.

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:28.500
But as the 1990s approached, new technologies emerged

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:32.500
that prompted our brothers to revisit motion pictures yet again.

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:37.500
Video cassette players could be found in more and more homes.

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:43.500
And so, in 1990, we released our very first video,

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:48.500
Jehovah's Witnesses, the organization behind the name.

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:52.500
It took viewers behind the scenes and built appreciation

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:59.099
for how our literature is produced and used in the global preaching work.

00:33:59.099 --> 00:34:05.099
The faithful and discrete slave has made extensive use of video ever since.

00:34:05.099 --> 00:34:12.380
Motion picture technology has changed dramatically in 100 years.

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:18.380
But the objective of Jehovah's organization in using it has always been the same.

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:30.900
To touch the hearts of people everywhere with Bible truth.

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:35.900
Jehovah has always understood the power of visuals.

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:38.900
He gave the prophets visions.

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:44.900
And now we have the technology that combines visual power and emotional impact.

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:47.900
Digital technology continues to change.

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:53.900
But our goal has not to reach the heart.

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:58.900
True Christians cherish the truth that this wicked world will soon end.

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:04.900
But what are the pitfalls of serving Jehovah with a date in mind?

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:07.900
In the following dramatization, let's see how a Christian couple

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:13.900
is lovingly helped to adjust their mindset.

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:44.380
I've got some news.

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:53.989
How do you feel about moving to the South Congregation?

00:35:53.989 --> 00:35:55.989
Why the South Congregation?

00:35:55.989 --> 00:35:57.989
We're not even in their territory.

00:35:57.989 --> 00:36:03.639
It's twice as far.

00:36:03.639 --> 00:36:09.239
It feels like the wrong time.

00:36:10.239 --> 00:36:13.239
With everything happening in the Congregation.

00:36:13.239 --> 00:36:17.099
But they need help.

00:36:17.099 --> 00:36:21.099
So brother Maseko asked.

00:36:21.099 --> 00:36:25.099
Just asked if we'd be willing.

00:36:25.099 --> 00:36:27.099
I'm tired.

00:36:27.099 --> 00:36:34.889
We can talk about it tomorrow and you.

00:36:34.889 --> 00:36:37.889
No. I mean I'm tired of everything.

00:36:37.889 --> 00:36:39.889
Starting over, making changes.

00:36:39.889 --> 00:36:41.889
This whole system.

00:36:41.889 --> 00:36:44.889
We've always been happy to do what Jehovah has asked.

00:36:44.889 --> 00:36:51.840
But I never thought this system would drag on for so long.

00:36:51.840 --> 00:37:05.360
I don't think either of us ever imagined would be where we are now.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.360
I know we've made the right decisions.

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:13.090
But with our money so tight.

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:20.360
And then tonight holding to Lani.

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:30.000
It's just strange to think that if things had been different.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.139
They probably have a family now.

00:37:35.139 --> 00:37:58.050
Tavo. James.

00:37:58.050 --> 00:38:01.050
What's the news, my friend?

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:03.050
You're getting an early start tonight.

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:06.050
Well, after this I've got another job.

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:10.050
Good thing I'm only 25.

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:14.050
So I hear you and Lina are moving to the South Congregation.

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:16.050
We need you there.

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:19.050
Yes, we're.

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:22.050
Well, we're talking about it.

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:27.059
You and Lina are always eager to help.

00:38:27.059 --> 00:38:29.059
We try our best.

00:38:29.059 --> 00:38:32.059
But this move, I don't think we can do it.

00:38:32.059 --> 00:38:34.059
Are you okay?

00:38:37.519 --> 00:38:39.519
Maybe we're just running out of steam.

00:38:39.519 --> 00:38:45.659
Well, you both work very hard.

00:38:45.659 --> 00:38:48.659
So do you.

00:38:48.659 --> 00:38:51.659
What are you doing Saturday?

00:38:51.659 --> 00:38:57.639
Could you come over for some dinner?

00:38:57.639 --> 00:38:59.639
I understand.

00:38:59.639 --> 00:39:02.639
I never dream that I'll be this agent, this system.

00:39:02.639 --> 00:39:04.639
And now look at these wrinkles.

00:39:04.639 --> 00:39:06.639
I don't see any wrinkles.

00:39:06.639 --> 00:39:08.639
You haven't slowed down a bit.

00:39:08.639 --> 00:39:10.639
I have my hard days.

00:39:10.639 --> 00:39:14.639
But I've learned a long time ago that focusing on when the end will come.

00:39:14.639 --> 00:39:17.639
It's just not good.

00:39:17.639 --> 00:39:20.639
That's what happened to Dorothy, you know?

00:39:20.639 --> 00:39:25.639
We started pioneering right after we got married.

00:39:25.639 --> 00:39:30.070
We were excited.

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:33.070
We thought the end was really close.

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:37.769
But things just kept going.

00:39:37.769 --> 00:39:44.179
Years went by, and Dorothy changed.

00:39:44.179 --> 00:39:49.179
She was angry that Armageddon hadn't come.

00:39:49.179 --> 00:39:52.179
She started doubting it ever would.

00:39:52.179 --> 00:40:07.739
In the end, she left Jehovah and me.

00:40:07.739 --> 00:40:09.739
That had to be devastating.

00:40:09.739 --> 00:40:14.619
It was the hardest time of my life.

00:40:14.619 --> 00:40:19.619
And true that 2 Peter 3 verse 12 tells us to await

00:40:19.619 --> 00:40:23.619
and keep close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah.

00:40:23.619 --> 00:40:27.619
But we have to be careful not to wait in frustration.

00:40:27.619 --> 00:40:33.619
I remember how in Jesus' day, many of his disciples stopped following him.

00:40:34.619 --> 00:40:39.619
Because his words didn't meet their expectations.

00:40:39.619 --> 00:40:41.619
But what did Peter say?

00:40:41.619 --> 00:40:44.619
Oh Lord, who shall we go away to?

00:40:44.619 --> 00:40:47.619
For you have sayings of everlasting life.

00:40:47.619 --> 00:40:54.619
The truth is the truth, even if it doesn't unfold how or when you expect.

00:40:54.619 --> 00:41:29.760
We have to be focused on giving our all today and keeping ourselves in Jehovah's love.

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:33.760
Are you eager to see what unfolds for James and Linda?

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:38.760
Watch for part 2 of our video in a future broadcast.

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:41.760
What do we learn from this first episode?

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:45.760
As Tavo observed, serving Jehovah with a date in mind

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:49.760
can lead to spiritual disaster.

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:52.760
Rather than fixate on when the end comes,

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:57.760
let's focus on who we are now before it arrives.

00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:01.760
Tavo also said, the truth is the truth.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:05.760
How do we know that we are practicing true Christianity?

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:12.260
That's the intriguing topic of this morning worship presented by Brother John Ekran.

00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:16.260
Many years ago, a brother of my congregation asked me to go with him in field service

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:20.260
and return on a man who had asked him to come back.

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:25.260
Well, it wasn't too long after we were there in his house

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:29.260
that it became clear to us that he wasn't so much interested in listening to us

00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:34.260
as he was to convince us that Jehovah's Witnesses was the wrong religion.

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:37.260
And he went on to attack Brother Russell.

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:44.260
Charles Tays Russell started your organization and he made accusations about Brother Russell did this and that and etc.

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:48.260
And his reasoning was that since Brother Russell was flawed in these ways

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:53.260
that God could not have used him to start the right religion.

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:58.260
Well, we took out the opportunity to point out his wrong reasoning.

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:04.260
And basically, he was saying that God cannot use imperfect men to do his will.

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:07.260
Well, think if we applied that to the Bible.

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:12.260
Moses failed to credit Jehovah God for the miracle with the water.

00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:15.260
What are we going to do? Take out the first five books of the Bible.

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:17.260
David sinned with Bathsheep.

00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:20.260
We're going to take out most of the Psalms.

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:22.260
Peter denied Christ. There goes first and second Peter.

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:27.260
See that reasoning really doesn't make sense.

00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:31.260
Jehovah God does use imperfect people to do his will.

00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:34.260
But putting aside his flawed reasoning for a moment,

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:39.260
maybe you've heard others say that Jehovah's Witnesses are breakaway Christian sect

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:43.260
or that we're a new American religion.

00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:45.260
Is that really true?

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:49.260
Did Brother Russell start a new religion?

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:51.260
No, absolutely not.

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:56.260
What he did do is rediscover the true religion of the Bible,

00:43:56.260 --> 00:44:00.260
the way it was practiced by Jesus and the apostles.

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:08.260
What Russell and the early Bible students did was exactly what Jehovah told the nation of Israel to do

00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:11.260
when they had lost their way spiritually.

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:15.260
I'd like you to look at Jeremiah chapter 6 and verse 16.

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:18.260
And notice the advice that Jehovah gave them.

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:25.079
Jeremiah chapter 6 and verse 16.

00:44:25.079 --> 00:44:27.079
This is what Jehovah says.

00:44:27.079 --> 00:44:30.079
Stand at the crossroads and see.

00:44:30.079 --> 00:44:33.079
Ask about the ancient roadways.

00:44:33.079 --> 00:44:39.079
Ask where the good way is and walk in it and find rest for yourselves.

00:44:39.079 --> 00:44:43.079
Now if you look at the research guide on this verse,

00:44:43.079 --> 00:44:46.079
one of the first watchtower references says,

00:44:46.079 --> 00:44:52.079
Jehovah exhorts his rebellious people to pause, examine themselves,

00:44:52.079 --> 00:45:00.079
and find their way back to the roadways of their faithful ancestors.

00:45:00.079 --> 00:45:03.079
Well, that's exactly what those early Bible students did.

00:45:03.079 --> 00:45:07.079
They asked about the ancient roadways that Jesus walked.

00:45:07.079 --> 00:45:15.079
Now, can you imagine an explorer trying to locate in a jungle an ancient path that was there?

00:45:15.079 --> 00:45:24.079
Now, in a jungle, the path could have been covered over by years of growth and it would be difficult.

00:45:24.079 --> 00:45:32.079
But maybe he saw a stone or two and eventually by cutting away the jungle around it,

00:45:32.079 --> 00:45:38.079
imagine his excitement at finding that ancient path.

00:45:38.079 --> 00:45:43.079
Well, when you get a chance to read some of the early writings about the Russell

00:45:43.079 --> 00:45:48.079
and the early Bible students, you get a real sense of discovery

00:45:48.079 --> 00:45:54.079
that they are excited to have found the truce that they're there in the Bible all along.

00:45:54.079 --> 00:46:04.079
It just been covered over with hundreds, thousands of years of lies and twisted doctrines taught by false Christianity.

00:46:04.079 --> 00:46:08.079
Yes, Jehovah's Witnesses are not a breakaway religion.

00:46:08.079 --> 00:46:17.079
We practice Christianity by following closely the model set out in the Bible by Jesus and the Apostles.

00:46:17.079 --> 00:46:25.079
We could really say that the early Bible students led by Holy Spirit found the ancient path of true Christianity

00:46:25.079 --> 00:46:32.079
and they cleared away thousands of years of pagan philosophies and man-made doctrines.

00:46:32.079 --> 00:46:39.079
Right away, the early Bible students eliminated a lot of jungle growth from the path.

00:46:39.079 --> 00:46:43.079
No immortal soul, we are a soul, no hellfire.

00:46:43.079 --> 00:46:48.079
When we die, we cease to exist and depend on a resurrection.

00:46:48.079 --> 00:46:53.079
The ransom, Jesus' death saved all of mankind that would put faith in them.

00:46:53.079 --> 00:47:00.079
God's kingdom is a heavenly government that will rule over the earth and established in 1914.

00:47:00.079 --> 00:47:07.079
It's amazing how well they cleared the path. Now, of course, there was still much work to do, but the path was much clearer.

00:47:07.079 --> 00:47:20.079
In fact, so clear and profound were those truths, and so clear was the path that if you read the life experiences and life stories of those that came to the truth in the 1920s and 1930s,

00:47:20.079 --> 00:47:28.079
they'll often say that they read one book or one brochure and say, I have found the truth.

00:47:28.079 --> 00:47:35.079
And, of course, this was not just clearing away doctrine, also how the organization operated.

00:47:35.079 --> 00:47:39.079
Appointments of elders, not elections, not paid.

00:47:39.079 --> 00:47:46.079
Circuit overseers that visit the congregations like Paul and Timothy did, weekly congregation meetings,

00:47:46.079 --> 00:47:51.079
to make sure that we could study and read about Jehovah and discuss Bible truths,

00:47:51.079 --> 00:47:57.079
or focus on the preaching work like the apostles did, door to door, and public witnessing.

00:47:57.079 --> 00:48:10.079
Our text for today, Acts chapter 16 and verse 4, is one example of how closely Jehovah's organization today follows the first century pattern.

00:48:10.079 --> 00:48:19.679
Let's read Acts chapter 16 for its entirety. Acts chapter 16 verse 4,

00:48:20.679 --> 00:48:33.679
As they traveled on through the cities, they would deliver to them for observance the decrees that had been decided on by the apostles and the elders who were in Jerusalem.

00:48:33.679 --> 00:48:43.679
So led by Jesus Christ, who was it that sent out these decrees? It was the apostles and elders in Jerusalem.

00:48:43.679 --> 00:48:50.679
Yes, Jehovah's Witnesses today, we don't have a single leader or one man that is leading the organization.

00:48:50.679 --> 00:48:59.679
We're organized today as it was in the first century, a governing body, a group of men, Jehovah uses to lead his organization today.

00:48:59.679 --> 00:49:06.679
And all the congregations around the world are united by the direction that we get from the governing body.

00:49:07.679 --> 00:49:18.679
And just as the apostles and elders in Jerusalem would send out decrees for all the early Christian congregations of the time, the same exact model is used today.

00:49:18.679 --> 00:49:34.679
Now today, decisions from the governing body take many forms. It could be articles in the watch tower, letters to bodies of elders and the congregations, governing body updates, organizational direction provided at schools and many other forms.

00:49:34.679 --> 00:49:43.679
But all around the world, no matter where Jehovah's Witnesses live, they accept the direction from one governing body.

00:49:43.679 --> 00:49:53.679
There's not the Latin Jehovah's Witnesses or the American Jehovah's Witnesses or the European Jehovah's Witnesses, we're all united worldwide.

00:49:53.679 --> 00:50:01.679
And Jehovah's Witnesses in one country don't say, well, you know, I don't think that direction from the governing applies to us here.

00:50:02.679 --> 00:50:15.280
No, all of us understand that worldwide, Jehovah and Jesus are using the governing body as the channel for spiritual food and organizational direction.

00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:22.280
Now, some feel that because our world headquarters is in the United States, the Jehovah's Witnesses are an American religion.

00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:30.280
But that reasoning is like some who say that, well, the Bible is only for the Jews because it was written for by Jewish men.

00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:42.280
But clearly, the Bible's message is for all mankind. And the fact that Jehovah chose Jewish men to write it down for us doesn't limit its message to just Jews.

00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:52.280
Likewise, the fact that Jehovah chose the United States as the location for world headquarters doesn't mean that Jehovah's Witnesses are an American religion.

00:50:52.280 --> 00:51:01.280
There's no limit to anyone no matter what country or language from becoming one of Jehovah's Witnesses and worshipping Jehovah.

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:19.280
And the very fact that Jehovah's Spirit has moved the governing body to work so hard to make sure that the truth is available to all nations is further proof in my mind that we have found the path of Christianity that Jesus and the Apostles practiced.

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:33.280
Let me give you. First, Jehovah's Witnesses are not a new religion started by Brother Russell. But rather, Brother Russell and the early Bible students found the ancient path of Christianity that Jesus and the Apostles walked on.

00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:42.280
And secondly, Jehovah's Witnesses are not an American religion. The governing body has made every effort to reach all mankind with the truth.

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:49.280
We truly are the only united worldwide followers of Christ on the planet today.

00:51:49.280 --> 00:52:04.300
True Christianity has not changed. But at times our understanding of certain Bible teachings has been clarified. How do you feel about these refinements?

00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:12.300
We can learn much from one another's example. Please note the candid life story of Brother Norio Ishibashi.

00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:36.949
When will Jesus separate the sheep from the goats? When were true Christians held captive by Babylon the Great? There have been so many interesting developments in our understanding that I have deeply appreciated.

00:52:36.949 --> 00:52:55.130
However, some adjustments were a challenge for me. I was baptized in 1960 when I was 12 years old. I enjoy the circuit and district work for 41 years.

00:52:56.130 --> 00:53:16.110
In 1971, I was serving as the Congregation Servant. The divine name district assembly shine new light of truth. Before then, congregations had just won overseer the Congregation Servant.

00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:36.539
But that assembly highlighted it just as Philippians won one shows the first century Christian congregations had more than one elder. One day, there was a letter in my mailbox. It was from the branch.

00:53:37.539 --> 00:53:55.039
The letter said that the arrangement for a body of elders would start. So to prepare the Congregation Committee and exemplar brothers had to meet and recommend those they believe could serve as elders.

00:53:55.039 --> 00:54:16.960
We prayerfully discussed a matter. And all of us were recommended as ministerial servants. Until then, I had given public talks and other congregations and at circuit assemblies. Now, I would not be given such assignments.

00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:25.960
Many elders from other congregations would come up to me and ask, Brother Ishibashi, can you come and give a talk at our congregation?

00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:40.960
Oh, sorry, I can't. I'm not an elder. What? Everyone looked genuinely surprised that really tested my humility and at times I felt quite depressed.

00:54:40.960 --> 00:55:02.010
As Proverbs 418 says, the path of the righteous is like the bright morning light. With each flash of light, I needed to adjust to Jehovah's way of thinking and way of handling things and keep moving ahead.

00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:15.010
I prayerfully shifted gears. I had many things to do so I devoted myself to the field service and to congregation activities and I rejoiced over the congregation's growth.

00:55:15.010 --> 00:55:31.010
Having a body of elders helped many brothers. It helped them reach out and attain the scriptural qualifications to be an elder. That arrangement helps decisions to be made in better harmony with Jehovah's will.

00:55:31.010 --> 00:55:44.010
Those are great changes. A few months later, I received another letter from the branch. It said that I was to serve as an elder in a different congregation.

00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:58.739
When I receive new publications or a new watchtower magazine, I always study them carefully to see if there are any new understandings or topics to study further.

00:55:58.739 --> 00:56:08.739
I also look up the beliefs clarified section in the publications index and I make it a topic of personal study.

00:56:08.739 --> 00:56:33.289
This research has really benefited me. Jehovah is the God of love. By clarifying our beliefs, he has adjusted our organization to be more holy and more effective in carrying out his will.

00:56:33.289 --> 00:56:45.289
God's people are just getting better and better. We are always at new heights. It is so different from how the world is.

00:56:45.289 --> 00:56:55.289
I want to keep moving forward with Jehovah whenever he shows us his will as he guides us into the paradise to come.

00:57:05.059 --> 00:57:11.059
Refinements in our understanding of truth can strengthen our faith if we allow them to.

00:57:11.059 --> 00:57:19.059
That's what Brother Ishi Bashi did. He kept an open mind and prayerfully meditated on the refinements.

00:57:19.059 --> 00:57:28.059
If we do the same, we'll view clarifications as evidence that Jehovah continues to educate his humble people.

00:57:28.059 --> 00:57:35.059
Now it's time for this month's music video, which will remind us that Jehovah knows what we need.

00:57:35.059 --> 00:57:38.059
It's title? Let's keep it simple.

00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:22.440
Let's keep it simple. Let's keep it simple.

00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:29.440
And you and I will be free. Let's keep it simple. And be happy.

00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:56.739
You're satisfied with simple things. The joy and peace it brings. Let's keep it simple.

00:59:03.849 --> 01:01:23.579
We've enjoyed an encouraging program. We've learned that Jehovah has revealed his sacred secret to Christians, not for us to keep to ourselves, but to declare it boldly to all.

01:01:23.579 --> 01:01:28.579
Our preaching campaigns are an effective way to find sheep-like ones.

01:01:28.579 --> 01:01:35.579
Motion picture technology is a powerful tool to reach people's hearts with Bible truth.

01:01:35.579 --> 01:01:41.579
We've learned to appreciate doctrinal refinements as proof of Jehovah's love.

01:01:41.579 --> 01:01:52.340
And we've seen the value of focusing not on when the end will come, but on working every day to remain in God's love.

01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:57.340
Now let's visit our brothers and sisters in Colombia for this month's postcard.

01:01:57.340 --> 01:02:00.340
Does Colombia remind you of a certain beverage?

01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:03.340
It makes me think of coffee.

01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:16.340
Colombia is one of the world's largest coffee producers, since its soil, rainfall and geography are ideal for growing arabic abines known for their rich flavor and aroma.

01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:24.340
But more than coffee thrives here. Over 1,500 species of birds fill the air.

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:30.340
Jaguars, monkeys, sloths and tapers roam the landscape.

01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:37.340
Borrowing just below the surface, earthworms grow up to 1.8 meters, or 6 feet in length.

01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:44.340
The truth took root in the 1920s when Eleodora Hernandez began reading the watchtower.

01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:49.340
The first missionaries arrived in 1945.

01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:57.340
In the past, parts of the country suffered from internal conflicts, and some remote areas still experience their effects.

01:02:57.340 --> 01:03:07.340
Because our brothers maintain neutrality and wisely exercised caution in the ministry, the preaching work never stopped.

01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:17.340
Today, more than 186,000 publishers zealously share the good news with Colombia's 51 million inhabitants.

01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:25.340
Our brothers preach in 18 languages and dialects, and can be found in every corner of this diverse land.

01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:31.340
In cities such as Manisales, Bogota, Cartajena and Medellín.

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:44.340
You'll see them preaching in communities such as Vía de Leyva, rural areas like Niflandia, Córdoba, on the island of Providencia, and yes, on coffee farms too.

01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:49.340
Here, publishers are on their way to preach on an Embarachami Indigenous Reservation.

01:03:49.340 --> 01:04:01.590
In addition to the ministry, our brothers enjoy association, music, dancing, and delicious Colombian dishes such as Arepas, Mandeja Paisa and Sancocho.

01:04:02.590 --> 01:04:10.590
Our brothers and sisters in Colombia, including the Bethel family, send you their warm love and greetings.

01:04:10.590 --> 01:04:19.590
And please remember that we too cherish each one of you as part of our precious international family.

01:04:19.590 --> 01:04:25.590
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is J.W. Broadcasting.
