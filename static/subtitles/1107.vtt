00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.460
For the last 45 years, I've been pioneer work,

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:15.900
traveling work,

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.579
and being in Bethel here for a number of years.

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.500
Health was very good.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.300
Never had any problems at all.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.820
One day I had a headache.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.899
It was severe.

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:40.100
I really couldn't see clearly anything.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.060
We went to the Bethel doctor,

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:44.299
and he referred us to a specialist,

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:46.899
and a specialist gave us diagnosis

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.899
of a very aggressive rain tumor called glioblastoma.

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.840
He had surgery the next Thursday.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.960
Then after surgery, he had radiation

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.030
and chemotherapy at the same time.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.510
A year later, he had to have another surgery.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.670
And he is right now on his fourth type

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.879
of chemotherapy treatment.

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:18.920
From the very first one, he got sick.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.760
The hardest thing was to see my husband

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.079
become increasingly dependent upon me

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.230
and upon other people.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:36.790
I didn't want this to define who we are.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.629
The brothers played a pivotal role

00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:42.750
in trying to help us when found out

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.750
that I had to go in for surgery.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.349
Gave me a scripture, and we prayed together.

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:52.469
And I'll always remember that.

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:56.730
It was a beautiful example.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.370
And I also get a lot of encouragement from Sarah

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:06.090
who gets us prepared for meetings.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.169
But when we go out in service,

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:12.969
I've gotten an opportunity to go and help people.

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:20.219
Just talk to them and encourage them.

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:24.099
In my Bethel assignment in the service department,

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.580
I have a brother or two who will come over

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.539
and review a case that we're considering.

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:34.340
And I get a lot of joy in that way.

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:38.139
I'm very thankful that I can still do

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:43.819
a little something to help.

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.939
For me, because he's been humbled

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:50.889
through this whole thing, it's been easier.

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:53.530
My hope is strong.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.289
And I'm gonna keep right on going this way

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:59.930
and serve Jehovah right onto the new world

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.370
or whatever comes.
