00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:08.529
We're in the only race that offers the prize of everlasting life to all those who cross the finish line.

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:12.529
It's the only race of that kind.

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:18.530
And in this race, we don't compete with one another for Jehovah's favor.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.530
The spirit of competition in this world is out of control.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:31.530
In fact, can you imagine a professional soccer player resorting to biting a rival in a soccer match?

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:41.530
And really, we see so much competition and so many people in the sports world who just don't follow the rules of the game.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.530
In fact, there are times when I enjoy watching some sporting events,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:52.530
but there are times when it just soars me when I look at the attitude of some of the players and the way they deal with one another.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.530
And also the egotism and the pride that's involved with them.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.530
There's another thing also that I find almost amusing except for the individual it is.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:11.530
And in some cases, you can identify the sport that a person may be engaging in because he's got no front teeth.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.530
Now, I won't enumerate what sports I have in mind. I'll leave that with you.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:25.530
But the point is, we never want to stoop to biting a rival runner in the race that we're in.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.530
It can be done. Let's take our Bible and look at Galatians chapter 5.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:42.379
Galatians chapter 5 and we'll read verses 16, 15 and 16.

00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:50.379
Here the Apostle Paul wrote to the congregation, if though you keep on biting and devouring one another,

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:53.379
look out that you do not get annihilated by one another.

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:59.379
Well, that has to do with cutting gossip and evil remarks about other people.

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:04.379
And they would argue and fight over words and perhaps even traditions.

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:09.379
And Paul is telling them, don't do that. And we don't deal that way with our brothers and sisters.

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:14.379
And then in verse 16, he says, but I say keep walking and we'll insert a word there.

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:20.379
Keep running by spirit and you will carry out no fleshly desire at all.

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.379
And that's what all of us want to do.

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:30.379
It's common in races for the faster runners to pass the slower ones.

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:35.379
But we shouldn't be discouraged if someone in the race that we're in passes us.

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:39.379
It might seem that he passes us or she passes us.

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:44.379
Maybe the individual has more experience, a more ability, brighter.

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:51.379
But it's not going to make any real difference as to the outcome of the race as long as we give Jehovah God our best.

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.379
And we finish the race.

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:59.379
And that is a key point for us to keep in mind. It's the outcome of the race.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:07.379
A runner sometimes stumbles. You've perhaps seen this in some of these track field and track races or games that they play.

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.379
And usually if it's a short race and he stumbles, he's out of it.

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.379
He's just not going to be able to get back up and win the race.

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.379
He may end to finish the race, but he's not a winner.

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.379
Maybe he falls down, hurts himself.

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.379
Well, that can happen. That can happen to us even in the race that we're in.

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:30.379
But the key point with the race we're in, even if we fall down and we stumble, we get back up and we get going.

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:36.379
And who doesn't stumble over something at some time or another that irritates him or bothers him?

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:43.379
But we never stop running the race because all we want to do is stay in the race and finish it.

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:49.379
And something else to keep in mind if a person happens to stumble, even fall to the ground.

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.379
Don't look back at what caused it or who caused it.

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:59.379
Keep your eyes right in front of you, looking ahead at the course.

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:06.379
Because if a person, can you imagine a runner coming around the track and then looking back constantly to see my, what was it I tripped over?

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:09.379
Who did that to me? He's going to run into another runner.

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:16.379
He's going to be disqualified. He won't be obeying the rules or he'll just fall down again and he'll be out of the race.

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:21.379
So we don't want to look back and worry about past things, problems or stumbling that took place.

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:26.379
We get back up and we get going as well as we can.

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:29.379
Well, right now we're near the end of the race.

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:34.379
The goal is almost in sight. The finish line.

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:38.379
What does Paul tell us at Hebrews chapter 12?

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:45.629
Hebrews chapter 12 verse 1.

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:51.629
Paul writes, so then because we have such a great cloud of witnesses surrounding us.

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:54.629
Who is that great cloud?

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:59.629
Well, chapter 11 gives us the names of a lot of faithful people who ran the race.

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:01.629
They finished it.

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:04.629
They finished it when they died faithful to Jehovah.

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:08.629
And we have this cloud of witnesses around us.

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:11.629
We can read about their life, their experiences.

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:17.629
First as though they're on the sidelines in a sense having completed the race and now they're cheering us on.

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:18.629
Finish it.

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:23.629
Look at our problems. Look at the things we've done in spite of difficulties that we've had to face.

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:27.629
You can do it too. That's basically what they're telling us.

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:32.629
And then he says, let us also throw off every weight and the sin that easily entangles us.

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:36.629
Well, that sin that easily entangles us is a lack of faith, isn't it?

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:44.629
We can drift away, become irritated over some direction or perhaps a rule of some kind that we don't particularly care for.

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:48.629
And little by little a person can drift away, but we don't want that to happen to us.

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:52.629
In fact, we can become very anxious about certain things.

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:57.629
A key phrase that's good to keep in mind is reduce anxiety.

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:03.629
Whatever we can eliminate from our life to do away with anxiety is of benefit to us.

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:10.629
And then he goes on and he says, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us.

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:14.629
And we do have some wonderful examples of past runners.

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:24.629
Hannah, Ruth, Jeopardhys daughter, Abigail, Moses, Joshua, Caleb, and so many more.

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:27.629
So we want to imitate their faith.

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:29.629
Isn't that a wonderful publication we have?

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:31.629
To imitate their faith.

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:35.629
It's a pleasant thing to take an evening, perhaps each week.

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:42.629
And with your mate or with your roommate, go over a chapter of it. Read it out loud and cover the material.

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:44.629
It's very inspiring.

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:46.629
And we know we can finish the race.

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:49.629
We're going to do just what Jesus said.

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:54.629
The one that has endured to the end is the one that will be saved.

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:58.629
Just stick with it and give Jehovah our best.
