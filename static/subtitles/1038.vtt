00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:08.410
Martha Martha She was a hard-working, hospitable woman.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:17.550
The Bible tells us that Jesus loved Martha and her sister Mary and their brother Lazarus.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:25.769
When Lazarus took ill, Martha surely did everything in her power to soothe his discomfort.

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.170
She was so concerned with her brother's condition that she and her sister Mary sent a message

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:41.850
to Jesus as recorded at John 113, saying, Lord, see, the one for whom you have affection

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.490
is sick.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.570
Martha knew that Lazarus was seriously ill.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:56.530
She must have felt helpless as Lazarus sank deeper into his illness and then died.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.310
What would Martha do?

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:06.730
Would she give in to despair and would grief overpower her and weaken her faith?

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:16.469
As you watch the following video, try to imagine Martha's grief when her brother died.

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:20.870
During those first few days, everything was a blur.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.829
My sister Mary and I had never felt so empty and lost.

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:33.109
I knew that if our Lord had been here, our brother would not have died.

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:40.790
But through the tears and the pain, I had no doubt that the resurrection was real.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.959
Someday, someday, he would live again.

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:51.799
Who could have imagined it could happen that very day and right before our eyes,

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:58.840
we wept here's a joy and thanked our loving father in heaven, Jehovah.

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:10.039
Empathy helps us to feel the pain and the distress that Martha felt when Lazarus died.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.719
The Bible account tells us that Jesus traveled to Bethany where Martha lived,

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.199
but he did not arrive before Lazarus died.

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:24.840
In fact, he came four days after Lazarus had died.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.360
When Jesus met with Martha, she expressed faith that Jesus could have healed Lazarus,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.280
and she felt that Jesus might yet help her brother.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.000
The scriptures show that she also believed in the future resurrection.

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:48.520
Martha must have been thinking about miracles that Jesus had performed,

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.639
and the people who had been healed by him.

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:59.319
And she had no doubt that Jesus was the Christ and that he could perform miracles.

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:05.879
Read with me what the Bible says about Martha's faith in the resurrection,

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.919
and her confidence in Jesus.

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:13.960
It's found at John chapter 11 verses 21 through 26.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.879
It reads as follows.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.180
Martha then said to Jesus,

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.020
Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.379
She didn't say this to reproach Jesus.

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:31.219
She merely stated a fact.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.219
And then she goes on.

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:40.419
She says, yet even now, I know that whatever you ask God for, God will give you.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.099
Jesus said to her, your brother will rise.

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:52.340
Martha said to him, I know he will rise in the resurrection on the last day.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.580
Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.340
The one who exercises faith in me, even though he dies, will come to life.

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:11.219
And everyone who is living in exercises faith in me will never die at all.

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:13.460
Do you believe this?

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:22.579
In verse 27, Martha makes one of the most important statements that would ever pass her lips.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.019
It reads, she said to him,

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:36.019
Yes, Lord, I have believed that you are the Christ, the Son of God, the One coming into the world.

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:42.740
We can only imagine how much her faith was appreciated by Jesus.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:51.379
Jesus Christ has the same appreciation for us as we show our faith in His promises.

00:04:52.019 --> 00:04:59.379
In the following dramatization, observe how a sister's faith brings her comfort.

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:58.019
I lost my son, I lost part of myself, I tried to stay busy, but everything felt empty.

00:05:58.019 --> 00:06:31.250
In my darkest times, Jehovah's words brought me comfort.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:07:13.569
Not a day goes by that I don't think about branding, not just memories of how it was.

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:23.120
But even more, how wonderful it'll be to see Him soon in God's new world.

00:07:49.889 --> 00:08:00.449
Like Martha, we can build our faith in the resurrection by carefully considering all that God's

00:08:00.449 --> 00:08:08.769
word says about it. Think of all the evidence there is that Jesus was resurrected.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:17.009
The scriptures show clearly that after His death and resurrection, Jesus showed Himself alive

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:23.569
to His disciples. He also appeared to Saul of Tarsus, who became the Apostle Paul.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:32.610
In his letter to the Corinthians, Paul points out that more than 500 brothers saw the resurrect

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:41.330
to Jesus. And to show that it was not just hearsay, Paul tells us that most of those eyewitnesses

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:50.210
were still alive when He wrote to the Corinthians. Yes, they were living witnesses who could verify

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:58.690
the fact that Jesus was resurrected from the dead. And think about the inspired assurance

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:08.450
that we have at Revelation 21, 3, and 4, that the time is coming when death will be no more.

00:09:09.009 --> 00:09:17.009
When you think about it, who is it that declares that death will be no more at Revelation 21,

00:09:17.009 --> 00:09:26.450
3, and 4? None other than the resurrected Jesus Christ. We do well to imitate Martha by

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:35.250
maintaining strong faith when we face the loss of a loved one. No, it's not easy. It's painful.

00:09:36.129 --> 00:09:42.529
But we can do it knowing full well that this life is not all there is.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:52.210
All true Christians must have faith in the resurrection. Faith that the dead will live again

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:57.570
and that death will be done away with in God's new world.

00:09:58.529 --> 00:10:08.129
Jehovah and His Son rewarded the faith of Martha, Mary, and Lazarus. We will be rewarded too

00:10:08.769 --> 00:10:19.059
if we build strong faith like that of Martha. Brother Garrett Lush, a member of the governing body,

00:10:19.059 --> 00:10:22.259
will now present the final talk of this symposium.

00:10:22.259 --> 00:10:29.379
Immitate women of strong faith. Modern day examples.
