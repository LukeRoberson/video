00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.820
The theme for the convention this year is very important.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.820
It's based on something Jesus very simply said.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.820
He said, speaking of God, your word is truth.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.820
We say God's word is truth. With humans, I think we all know that

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.820
it isn't always the truth or they have to revise it or change it later on.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.820
But when you get this message from God's word, the Bible,

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.820
then you know it's reliable and it's truth.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.820
The program is not exclusively for Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.820
Jehovah's Witnesses are sponsoring it, but when we are in the various communities,

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.820
we take the time to invite our neighbors.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:01:00.820
It's free, there are no collections, and yet sound counsel from the Bible is presented.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.819
Why? Because we face the same problems of life.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:09.819
And so we need reliable counsel from God's word, the Bible.

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:17.819
Families are going to benefit from the convention because there is instruction and counsel for every member of the family.

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:22.819
For the mother, for the father, for the teenagers, for the little children in the family.

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:28.819
All of them will hear counsel that can benefit them because that's how God's message is.

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:31.819
It's for the entire family.

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:38.819
These conventions are newsworthy simply because the message needs to be spread far and wide.

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:40.819
Here's something that's going to help you.

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:42.819
People are looking for help today.

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:48.819
They want something that's going to help them go through these difficult times that we live.

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:50.819
They're going to see, well this is excellent.

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:57.819
I see an atmosphere that's very different from what I normally find at events of this size.

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:04.819
They're going to see, well this is something that obviously benefits people because it's helped all of these people attending.

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:09.819
And they'll get the feeling, well I want to benefit in that same way.

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.819
And that's why I came.

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.819
I'm going to listen and learn this and they can have their own Bible or they'll be presented with the Bible.

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:25.819
And they can follow along and see what exactly is contained in God's word of truth, the Bible message.
