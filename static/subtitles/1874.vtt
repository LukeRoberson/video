Some individuals search for years before finding kingdom truth.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.419
Consider Mary Kennedy. She came to the United States from Scotland

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:19.339
in the early 1900s at the age of 18 and found work as a housekeeper.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.059
She dreamed of becoming a missionary. She found flaws in religion.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:33.340
Still wanting to help others, Mary began training in the medical field.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:40.140
And in 1910, she graduated from the Boston City Hospital Training School for nurses.

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:49.579
She continued to search for truth, but was disappointed by false doctrines and the hypocrisy she

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:56.219
found in many churches. She kept reading her Bible, even though she thought

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.700
she was finished with religion. While working at the Potenture Sanatorium in California,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:09.500
she found what she'd been looking for. She came in contact with a nurse and Bible student

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:17.180
named Nellie Hanford. One day, Nellie shared with her what the Bible says about the condition

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:24.459
of the dead. Mary said that it was like a telephone switchboard in her mind with one light after

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:32.700
another turning on. Instantly, she knew she'd found the truth. She abandoned all her ambitions and

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:41.980
medicine and began a lifelong career as a full-time minister of the Bible. Some, like Mary,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.500
actively searched for the truth. Others, find it, even though they weren't looking for it.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.969
My life revolved around volleyball at the highest national level. Training every day,

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.969
traveling regularly and playing matches meant that everything else had to take second place.

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.849
I wasn't really searching for the truth, but my girlfriend started studying the Bible.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.569
I thought, I'd really like to know more about this. I discovered that it's just like a jigsaw puzzle,

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.770
where all the pieces fit neatly into place. Daniel, chapter 2, in particular, intrigued me.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.849
And I realized that it was important to do more with what I was learning.

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:31.650
So I had to decide between a temporary life in this world or eternal life on their god's kingdom.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.169
I needed to make changes in how I spent my time and in my priorities. I was quite self-centered.

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:45.569
Right when I decided to stop, I got a lucrative offer to play with the defending champions for a year.

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.810
I could finally achieve all the things I had been working hard for all those years,

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.930
recognition and a good income, but I still decided to refuse their offer.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.889
Before I came into the truth, I thought I knew how to achieve success, but Jehovah knows the

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:06.930
best way to succeed in life. I'm very glad that I'm now able to spend my time helping others,

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.530
and that's what brings true happiness. And now my wife and I serve Jehovah full time,

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:21.180
which is the best way you can use your life. Jehovah drew both Mary and beyond to the truth.

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:27.659
Both of them focused on the value, not the cost of kingdom truth.
