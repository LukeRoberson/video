00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:09.830
Usually, the language that we learn from infancy becomes the language of the heart.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.509
And we learn it at home.

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.789
In most cases, the dominant influence in our life, in connection with our language of heart

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.350
or the first language, is our mother.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.949
And that's precisely what took place in Israel, in the days of Nehemiah.

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:32.789
But the mothers, in this case, were pagans, sharing their language and probably their beliefs

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:34.710
with their children.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.229
And a lot of Jewish men, prominent Jewish men, had married pagan women.

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:50.020
Let's read the scripture together at Nehemiah, chapter 13, verses 23 and 24.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.820
Nehemiah 13, 23 and 24.

00:00:53.939 --> 00:01:02.899
In those days, I also saw Jews who had married Ashtadite, Ammonite, and Moabite women.

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.659
Half of their sons were speaking Ashtadite and the language of the different peoples.

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:15.500
But none of them knew how to speak the language of the Jews.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.859
And as was stated, it's very likely that those mothers would be teaching the children

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:27.219
about their land, their culture, and their worship, the pagan gods, their worship.

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:34.420
And so the decision was made by the Jews themselves when they were counseled and given direction

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.819
from Ezra and from Nehemiah to send those wives away along with the children.

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:42.900
And that's an interesting thing.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.900
It must have been a bit difficult for some husbands to see their children sent away.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.859
All they knew were the languages of the pagan wives, nothing about Hebrew and the worship

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:55.379
of Jehovah God.

00:01:55.379 --> 00:02:00.620
And the problem was, they were sent away to keep the Jews from losing their identity.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.219
By a gradual assimilation into the cultures and the religions of the surrounding nations,

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:09.500
that those wives belong to.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.340
In Nehemiah's day, speaking Hebrew was vital, and we're grateful it's not necessary today.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.699
We all don't have to learn Hebrew.

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:25.300
But in his wisdom, Jehovah invites people who speak any language to learn the pure language,

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.139
the truth about him and his purposes.

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:33.500
And you know, it's a bit, it's like the opposite of what took place at the Tower of Babel,

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.539
where Jehovah intervened, confused the builders of the Tower of Babel, imposing upon them different

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:42.500
languages, including different ways of thinking.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.419
And so they went off, disorganized, separating from one another.

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:51.699
And today we have people from all over the world who speak many, many different languages,

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:57.020
but in Jehovah's wisdom, he's bringing them all together, those who love the truth and

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.460
love him in unity.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:06.740
And this is what Zephaniah says, Zephaniah chapter 3 verse 9, it speaks of the pure language.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.379
I shall give to peoples the change to a pure language.

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.379
In order for them all to call upon the name of Jehovah, and that's what these people

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:20.060
do, who speak other languages, we reach them with the truth, but then they're unified

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.939
with Jehovah's organization, because it goes on to say, in order to serve him, shoulder

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:27.340
to shoulder.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.419
So isn't that interesting?

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:34.539
The way Jehovah has used the pure language to bring people of many diverse backgrounds

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:38.659
and languages together in his worship.

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:44.180
In our days, people in many different languages are leaving their home countries to live elsewhere.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.419
And it's really quite amazing when you consider large cities are filled with people of different

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:50.419
languages.

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:55.860
And even little villages, we find people speaking different languages.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:03.849
They need help to learn the truth in the language of their heart.

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:08.610
It's interesting to note about Bethelites, how many have learned other languages in order

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.370
to teach the truth to people.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:20.170
In the United States, Bethel, in our branch, there are over 2,500 Bethelites who are engaged

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:26.050
in congregations, 24 different language groups and congregations.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.730
So a lot of Bethelites and commuters are included in those numbers, are doing a very fine work

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.569
in helping people in the territory to learn the truth.

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:39.170
And wouldn't it be nice, I know some of us would love to learn some other languages?

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.410
Wouldn't it be lovely if we could learn the way a child does?

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:43.689
They just absorb it.

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:47.089
No effort, and they start speaking it.

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:53.170
A researcher, Dr. John Breerley, says this, clearly the young brain seems to be programmed

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.089
almost like a computer for language development.

00:04:57.089 --> 00:05:03.610
He notes that even brain anatomy suggests that an infant is born with a pre-programmed

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.370
biological capacity to speak.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.889
And then comment, the comment in a wake said, it says, though the brain is hardwired to

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:19.250
learn language, I'm sorry to say that as the years go, as the years go by, the hardwiring

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.560
starts to fray a bit in many of us.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:31.000
But if we make the effort and we do make a switch to a congregation where they speak the

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.079
language, where you would like to learn, remember this, children can be a big help in the

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:41.000
congregation that you attend in a foreign language.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.360
They can also be very startling, and Frank, you speak funny.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.000
Why can't you pronounce that word properly?

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000
It's so easy.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.480
Well, yes, to you it's easy, you were raised with it, but that's how kids are.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.519
They don't realize the difficulties we have as we get older with the grooves being so

00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:03.920
deep and so thick in the brain with our original language that it's hard to get out of those

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:11.600
grooves with vowels and consonants that we're not used to saying in a certain order.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:18.399
Keep a sense of humor, listen to the kids, they'll help you, and don't be overly concerned

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:22.839
about speaking a new language without an accent.

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:28.199
Everybody has an accent, one way or another, some are more agreeable than others, but everyone

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:29.439
has that.

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:33.759
So, and some don't want to admit it, but they really do, they have an accent.

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:37.199
Even when we all speak the same language, you can tell who our person is from, whether

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:43.439
it's East, North, West, whatever it may be, South, there are accents or intonations the

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:45.199
way words are pronounced.

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:50.319
I remember years gone by for missionaries who were sent out into the field.

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:54.199
We had to follow a special program in learning a new language, your first month in your new

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:59.399
assignment, you had to study 11 hours a day for 30 days, your first month, your

00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:01.160
new language.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.480
Well you felt like you were in the tower of Babel on those occasions because it was very

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.480
difficult.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.680
The second month you had to study your new language four hours a day and be out preaching

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.800
130 hours.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:19.680
Your third month, 150 hours in the field ministry and study language as you can.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.720
For those who are striving to learn a new language, here are a few suggestions I gleaned

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:31.800
from a wake of March 2007 and the January issue of 2000, there are four points.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:41.079
One, motivation, two, humility, three, patience, four, practice.

00:07:41.079 --> 00:07:46.319
Motivation, you need an incentive, a reason to pursue your goal because if you have a high

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:50.040
level of motivation, you're going to be more successful.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.399
We have the best motivation there is.

00:07:52.399 --> 00:07:53.879
Teach people the truth.

00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:59.319
Praise our God, Jehovah, build up the congregation we've chosen to attend.

00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:01.000
What about humility?

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.639
Well, don't expect too much of yourself when you start learning a new language.

00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:12.240
Mistakes are inevitable and if you wait until you can speak it perfectly before you start

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:18.519
making comments or give a talk, you may be waiting quite a while, be prepared because

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.800
it may not be until after Armageddon that you achieve that goal.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:28.480
So don't be afraid to make mistakes and carry on with your new language.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:33.960
Patients, a brother stated, for me the first two years were difficult and at times I felt

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.879
like giving up.

00:08:35.879 --> 00:08:43.159
Still he acknowledges it does get easier as time goes by and he gets enjoyable.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:45.320
In number four, practice.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:50.360
A regular routine will help you to become fluent in your new language.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.120
Try to practice every day, even if it's for just a few minutes.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.519
There's an interesting saying as one textbook puts it.

00:08:56.519 --> 00:09:03.120
A little and often is preferable to a lot but sell them.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:08.799
So be steady, even for short periods of time in practicing the new language.

00:09:08.799 --> 00:09:12.919
Now the fact is that most Bethelites in our branch are serving in the English language

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:17.919
field and they are truly a blessing to the congregations.

00:09:17.919 --> 00:09:23.559
The brothers are happy to have Bethelites who take the lead, who give of themselves and

00:09:23.559 --> 00:09:26.600
work hard to build up the congregation.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:32.799
So the decision to serve in an English congregation or with a different language group is highly

00:09:32.799 --> 00:09:34.639
personal.

00:09:34.639 --> 00:09:38.759
Whatever the decision may be, there's a key factor that we all have to keep

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:45.519
in mind to maintain our spirituality at a high level and giving our Bethel assignment

00:09:45.519 --> 00:09:47.039
our best.

00:09:47.039 --> 00:09:52.200
And that key factor that we have to keep in mind is to focus on the one language that

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:58.399
counts the most, the pure language that Jehovah God has given to His people.
