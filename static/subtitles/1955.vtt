00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:22.140
The universe is vast and awe-inspiring.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.140
Earth and life on it are amazingly complex.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.899
How did it all get here?

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:41.950
The Bible book of Genesis says that there is a creator.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.950
But the account is often misunderstood,

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.950
or even dismissed as a myth.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:55.929
Is what the Bible says about the origin of the universe plausible?

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:01.929
Scientists estimate that the universe is 14 billion years old.

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:06.930
This implies that the universe, including Earth, had a beginning.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.980
The Bible agrees.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.980
Genesis 1, 1 reads,

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.980
In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.980
The account does not say when, or how the universe began.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:31.980
Rather, it focuses on the creative process that took place on Earth over six periods of time,

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.379
which the Bible calls days.

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:40.379
Were these six 24-hour days as many believe?

00:01:40.379 --> 00:01:42.379
No.

00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:48.379
The Hebrew word used in the Bible for day can refer to various lengths of time.

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:54.379
Genesis even summarizes the six days of creation as one day.

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:58.379
The day that Jehovah God made Earth and Heaven.

00:01:58.379 --> 00:02:06.379
Each day in Genesis 1 must have spanned extremely long periods of time.

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:11.379
The account's perspective is also important.

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:18.379
The writer describes the creative periods as they would have appeared to an observer on the Earth.

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.379
Had someone been there,

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:27.379
he would have seen events that started in one period and then progress into the following periods.

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:34.979
Light penetrates the atmosphere to reveal alternating day and night.

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:40.979
Earth was covered with water and vapor filled the air.

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:47.979
The dense clouds lifted from the waters that covered the Earth, forming an expansive sky between them.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.520
Water receded to uncover dry ground and the first plants appeared.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.520
The atmosphere cleared further to reveal the sun and the moon.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:08.520
God created living creatures in the sea and flying creatures above.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.520
And in the last period, God created land animals and humans.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:26.080
In harmony with the Genesis account, the Bible says,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.080
Of course, every house is constructed by someone,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.080
but the one who constructed all things is God.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.080
The Bible does not speak in scientific detail,

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.460
but its account of creation is logical and reasonable.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:51.460
The Bible also offers logical and reasonable answers to other important questions.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.460
Does our planet exist for a purpose?

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.460
What is the meaning of life?

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.460
What does the future hold?

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.460
