WEBVTT

00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.530
Thank you for joining us and welcome to the program.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.529
It's our privilege to spend the next hour with you dear brothers and sisters.

00:00:09.529 --> 00:00:15.529
Please join us on the field trip to Ethiopia, where we will meet brothers Defanos Demsas.

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:22.530
Brother Demsas and his wife served faithfully for many years while the preaching work was under ban.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.530
You will enjoy their experiences.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.530
Have you ever participated in a preaching campaign?

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.530
Our team was present when one was arranged in Armenia.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:38.530
A preaching campaign is uplifting and encouraging to everyone involved as this segment will show.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.530
How would you react if one of your loved ones decides to leave the truth?

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.530
It truly is heartbreaking to say the least.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.530
But what Bible principles can help us endure such a challenge?

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.530
This dramatization will help us.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.530
This is the November program of JW Broadcasting.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:23.260
We have selected the theme be a champion of truth.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.260
You may have heard of the word champion used in the context of sports.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.260
What is a champion?

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260
The word can have different meanings.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.260
The word is related to the French word Shaw, meaning field.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:44.260
That word has its origin in the Latin word compass, also meaning field or battlefield.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:53.659
The Bible speaks of a champion on a battlefield in 1 Samuel chapter 17 and verse 4.

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:01.659
Then a champion came out from the camps of the Philistines, his name was Goliath.

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:08.659
Goliath was a champion for a wrong cause, namely to take the lead in defeating the ancient Israelites in battle.

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:19.659
In our modern time, according to one definition, a champion is an ardent defender or supporter of a cause or another person.

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:24.659
Christians today are ardent defenders and supporters of the truth.

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:29.659
The Watchtower of January 15, 2012, said on page 8,

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:31.659
quote,

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:36.659
other champions of Bible truth rose up in the centuries that followed.

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:39.659
Years before, the Watchtower said,

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:45.659
this magazine will never shrink in fear from championing the truth.

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:50.659
The Watchtower has been championing the cause of kingdom truth.

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.659
So are you a champion?

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:59.659
In a sports competition, only one individual gets to be the champion.

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:04.659
But in the case of true Christians, all can be champions of the truth.

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:10.659
All Christians are to defend the truth and become conquerors, winners.

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:17.659
It's necessary to defend the truth because in today's world truth is being attacked and distorted.

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:23.659
We are surrounded by a sea of lies and misrepresentations.

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:26.659
How did such lies get started?

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:31.659
They started in the Garden of Eden when Satan told Eve lies.

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:36.659
Satan, through his deceptive statements, became the father of the lie.

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:43.659
All the problems in the world, all calamities, also your personal calamities,

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:48.659
all wars, all diseases, all crimes, all unhappiness,

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:55.659
sorrow and death started with the original lies in the Garden of Eden.

00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:01.659
Satan is the father of the lie, but today there are many children of the lie.

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:03.659
Every one of us is affected.

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:07.659
We are surrounded by a sea of lies.

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:14.659
A lie is a false statement deliberately presented as being true, a falsehood.

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:17.660
A lie is the opposite of the truth.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:24.660
Lying involves saying something incorrect to a person who is entitled to know the truth about a matter.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.660
But there is also something that is called a half-truth.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.660
The Bible tells Christians to be honest with each other.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:40.660
Now that you have put away the seat, speak truth, broke the Apostle Paul at Ephesians 4.25.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.660
Lies and half-truth undermine trust.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:51.660
A German proverb says, who lies once, is not believed even if he says the truth.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.660
So we need to speak openly and honestly with each other,

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:01.660
not with holding bits of information that could change the perception in the listener or mislead him.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.660
As to lies, there are different types.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.660
Some politicians have lied about matters they wanted to keep secret.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.660
Companies sometimes lie in advertisements regarding their products.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.660
What about the news media?

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:25.660
Many tried to report events truthfully, but we should not be gullible and believe everything newspaper's right

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.660
or everything we hear on radio or sea on television.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.660
Then there are religious lies.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:42.660
If Satan is called the father of the lie, then Babylon, the great, the global empire of false religion can be called the mother of the lie.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.660
Individual false religions could be called daughters of the lie.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.660
Some lie by saying that sinners will get tormented in hell forever.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.660
Others lie by saying, one saved, always saved.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:06.660
Again, others lie by saying that the earth will be burned up on judgment day and all good people will go to heaven.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.660
Some worship idols.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:14.660
Paul wrote in Romans chapter 1 and 25,

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:24.660
they exchanged the truth of God for the lie and venerated and rendered sacred service to the creation rather than the creator.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.660
Then there are many lies of a personal nature that people express in everyday life.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:37.660
The businessman may get a phone call but tell his secretary to answer the caller by saying he is not in.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.660
This may be considered a small lie.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:46.660
There are small lies, big lies and malicious lies.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:54.660
A child may have broken something but when asked initially out of fear of punishment denies having done it.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.660
This does not make the child a malicious liar.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:06.660
In contrast, what if an entrepreneur tells his bookkeeper to falsify the entries in the books in order to save on taxes?

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:11.660
This lying to the tax office is certainly a serious lie.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:17.660
It is a deliberate attempt to mislead somebody that has the right to know.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.660
It also robs the government of what they have established as legal income.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.660
We can see that not all lies are the same.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:30.660
They are small lies, big lies and malicious lies.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:36.660
Satan is a malicious liar. He is the champion of the lie.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:44.660
Since Jehovah hates liars, we should avoid all lies, not just big or malicious lies.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:50.660
But can we find the truth? Some say, truth is relative.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:55.660
It is like saying, this is truth for you and this is truth for me.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:08:00.660
This claim is not logical when it comes to religious truth.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.660
Either God is a Trinity or He is not.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.660
Either the soul is mortal or it is not.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:11.660
Either there is a future paradise on earth or there is not.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:17.660
Either homosexuality is acceptable to God or it is not.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:22.660
Either participating in wars is permissible or it is not.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:29.660
Truth is definite, not relative because Jehovah conveyed the truth to his servants.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:35.659
Psalm 43 verse 3 says, send out your light and your truth.

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:40.659
Jehovah is a revealer of truth.

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:45.659
One of several reasons why Jesus came into the world is to witness to the truth.

00:08:45.659 --> 00:08:54.659
At John 18, 37, B, he said, for this I have been born and for this I have come into the world

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:57.659
that I should bear witness to the truth.

00:08:57.659 --> 00:09:03.659
Everyone who is on the side of the truth listens to my voice.

00:09:03.659 --> 00:09:09.659
So if we listen to Jesus or read in the Bible what he thought, we can learn the truth.

00:09:09.659 --> 00:09:12.659
Jesus was the personification of the truth.

00:09:12.659 --> 00:09:18.659
He said, I am the way and the truth and the light.

00:09:18.659 --> 00:09:23.659
We can find out what the truth is by diligently studying the Bible.

00:09:23.659 --> 00:09:26.659
Truth is that which is effect.

00:09:26.659 --> 00:09:33.659
For true Christians the entire text of the Hebrew and Christian Greek scriptures constitutes the truth.

00:09:33.659 --> 00:09:42.659
Psalm 119 verse 160 says of Jehovah, the essence of your word is truth.

00:09:42.659 --> 00:09:50.659
That is why it is good to do daily Bible reading with meditation and weekly family worship.

00:09:50.659 --> 00:09:59.659
At Matthew 24, 45 to 47 we read that for the time of the end Jesus would appoint a faithful and discreet slave

00:09:59.659 --> 00:10:07.659
or governing body to explain the Bible to his followers and help them to grow in understanding of the truth.

00:10:07.659 --> 00:10:16.659
Whereas Jesus' teachings and the written word of God are inspired, the faithful and discreet slave is not inspired.

00:10:16.659 --> 00:10:19.659
Although it champions the truth.

00:10:19.659 --> 00:10:24.659
Nevertheless the faithful slave provides spiritual food.

00:10:24.659 --> 00:10:31.659
Whereas in the first century there was supernatural knowledge available for apostles and Bible writers.

00:10:31.659 --> 00:10:41.659
In the time of the end Jehovah does not bestow this miraculous gift anymore as explained at 1 Corinthians 13-8.

00:10:42.659 --> 00:10:51.659
Although there is no divine inspiration today, still Jesus leads his people progressively through the services of the faithful slave.

00:10:51.659 --> 00:10:58.659
Jesus trusts that the imperfect faithful slave will do its best to convey spiritual food.

00:10:58.659 --> 00:11:01.659
Do you also trust the slave?

00:11:01.659 --> 00:11:11.980
Whereas the truth of God's word does not change, our understanding of the truth does change because we are not perfect yet.

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:16.980
We understand more about the truth today than Christians in the first century.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:21.980
Do we keep up with the progressive understanding of truth?

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:29.980
Daniel was told many will rove about and the true knowledge will become abundant.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:34.980
This is a gradual process we are still roving about.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:40.980
During the millennium Jehovah will reveal additional truth to mankind.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:47.980
At Revelation 20-12 it mentions scrolls that will be opened.

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:55.980
The Apostle John reports that the dead are to be judged out of those things written in the scrolls according to their deeds.

00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:03.980
Evidently then these scrolls will contain additional information for mankind during the thousand years.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:09.980
It stands to reason that after the end of the millennium there will be additional truth to learn.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:16.980
Still, according to Ecclesiastes 3 verse 11,

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:22.980
mankind will never find out the work that the true God has made.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.980
But how do we know we have the truth?

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:32.980
At Pentecost 33 of our common era, true Christians numbered only about 3000.

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:40.980
Today we are millions and on average every weekend more than 5000 are getting baptized.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:45.980
But this in itself is not proof that we have the truth.

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:48.980
Truth is not measured in numbers.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:51.980
Why do we know we have the truth?

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:57.980
For one, because we remain in Jesus' teaching, John 831.

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:06.980
Second, we know we have the truth because of the deep bond of love for each other, John 1335.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:16.980
Third, we know we have the truth because our conduct adheres to the high moral standards of truth, John 1510.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:26.980
Fourth, we know we have the truth because we remain neutral in the controversies of the world, as Jesus advised at John 1714.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:37.980
Fifth, we know we have the truth because we are God's name people, Acts 1514 speaks of a people for His name.

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:41.980
Jesus said, the truth will set you free.

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:49.980
It sets us free from fears like the fear of death, fear of the future, and an exaggerated fear of man.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:57.980
It also sets us free from false teachings, from spiritism, and from astrology and magic.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.980
It frees us from immorality and its consequences.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:07.980
There are no other people on earth that are as spiritually free as we are.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:11.980
Do we appreciate that freedom?

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:20.980
Truth leads to freedom. Second Corinthians 317 says, where the spirit of Jehovah is, there is freedom.

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:24.980
The truth penetrates schools, how so?

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:29.980
By means of our children who preach the truth to classmates and to teachers.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:34.980
Do you go to school? Do you champion the truth at school?

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.980
How can you do this?

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:42.980
You do this not only by preaching, but also by your conduct, by your dress and grooming,

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:48.980
and by taking a stand for the truth when others want you to participate in un-Christian practices.

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:57.980
You also champion the truth by remaining honest and not cheating on your exams, and Jehovah will love you for that.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.980
The truth also penetrates prisons.

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:09.980
Reports have come in from many countries telling of the good work brothers are doing in contacting prisoners in various prisons,

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.980
helping some to rehabilitate their lives spiritually.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:23.980
In a number of such institutions, regular meetings are being held, and several prisoners have studied to the point of dedication and baptism.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.980
The truth penetrates even walls of monasteries.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:36.980
In Mexico in 2009, a nun was baptized who, because of the truth, had left her monastery and order,

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:40.980
although she was the mother superior.

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:43.980
The world is in utter confusion.

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:47.980
What a blessing to know the truth. We rejoice in it.

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:52.980
We have the truth on our lips. We have the truth around our hips.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:58.980
Ephesians chapter 6 says that the belt of truth is fastened around our wastes.

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:01.980
We are ready to teach it.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.980
We talk the truth and we walk in the truth.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:09.980
And those who continue to walk in the truth will walk in it forever.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:19.980
Help your students to love the truth and to live the truth, but if necessary, to be willing to die for the truth and for Jehovah.

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:24.980
The truth is invincible and we will conquer this wicked world.

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:30.980
In some countries, we may have many enemies who may want to silence us,

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:37.980
but the Apostle Paul said at 2 Corinthians chapter 13 verse 8,

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:42.980
for we can do nothing against the truth.

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:46.980
Neither can our enemies suppress the truth.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:51.980
Do we appreciate that we have the truth? The only truth?

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:54.980
Is this arrogant to say? By no means.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.980
It would be a sin if we would not say so.

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:02.980
Jesus was not arrogant when He said, I am the truth.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.980
To know the truth is not enough.

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:07.980
We need to champion it.

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:10.980
There are still many lovers of truth out there.

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:14.980
Search for them who will help you in the search.

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:23.980
According to John 4, 23, Jesus said that Jehovah is searching for ones that want to worship in truth.

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:29.980
The majority will not listen to the truth because they love the darkness rather than the light.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:37.980
The truth may expose their sinful conduct and they may not have the humility to want to repent and change.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.980
We still have to preach to them to warn them.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:46.980
Ezekiel was told, you must warn them from me.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:50.980
The principle applies to us as well.

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:54.980
Paul speaks of the sword of God's Word.

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.980
Use it well to champion the truth.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:02.980
Train your students to be good defenders of it as well.

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:06.980
The time will come in paradise after the final test.

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:14.980
When it will not be necessary to champion or defend the truth because nobody will attack it anymore.

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:25.980
Right now, whether we are adults, teenagers or children, let us follow and imitate Jesus the greatest champion of truth.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:34.980
To that end, keep studying the truth, keep spreading the truth, keep loving the truth and Jehovah the God of Truth.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:40.980
Hold fast to the truth as to a lifeline as this is what it is.

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:51.980
By staying faithful whether you survive Armageddon or are resurrected in paradise, you will be a victorious champion of the truth.

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:58.980
Let us now look at some examples of how our brothers and sisters around the world faithfully champion the truth.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.980
Thank you, Brother Loosh.

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:07.980
When a dear friend or perhaps even a family member leaves the truth, it can be a very challenging situation.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:13.980
It can truly be a test of our faith when we see something like that take place.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:36.099
While watching this dramatization, pay attention to how the mother was able to champion the truth by remaining loyal to Jehovah.

00:19:36.099 --> 00:19:39.099
My name is Gabriella.

00:19:39.099 --> 00:19:44.099
Ben and I have always enjoyed attending the meetings.

00:19:44.099 --> 00:19:48.099
But lately, it's been difficult.

00:19:48.099 --> 00:19:52.019
Something was missing.

00:19:52.019 --> 00:19:53.019
Our son.

00:19:53.019 --> 00:20:09.619
It was like watching a movie of someone else's family.

00:20:09.619 --> 00:20:20.720
Couldn't believe this was happening to us.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:59.190
Our son Levi was no longer one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:05.190
The elders and friends in the congregation were so supportive and understanding.

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:09.190
Many of them watched Levi grow up.

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:11.190
Give his first talk.

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:13.190
Get baptized.

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:36.980
I was so torn.

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:40.980
I was disappointed in Levi for leaving Jehovah.

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:43.980
But I was more disappointed in myself.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:53.700
I felt like we've failed him somehow.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.700
I kept wondering how he was doing.

00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:07.980
Was he okay?

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:12.980
Then, as hard as the past few weeks had been, it just got harder.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:23.579
I knew what the Bible said about quit mixing in company with anyone who is not living according to Christian standards.

00:22:23.579 --> 00:22:27.579
But I never thought that scripture would one day apply to me.

00:22:27.579 --> 00:22:46.900
Later that evening, a brother was talking about the example of Korra's sons.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:50.900
Jehovah confirmed that he was using Moses to lead his people.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.900
Not Korra.

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:59.900
When the people were told to move away from the rebel's tents, what would Korra's sons do?

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:10.039
Would they put loyalty to family ahead of loyalty to Jehovah?

00:23:10.039 --> 00:23:18.950
The Bible tells us that his sons remained loyal to Jehovah and were blessed for it.

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:24.950
That night, after the meeting, I told Ben about the text I received from Levi.

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:26.950
I told him everything.

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:29.950
How I miss Levi so much.

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:33.950
But that I also wanted to be loyal to Jehovah.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:35.950
Like Korra's sons.

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:40.950
Ben admitted that he too had been struggling with feelings like mine.

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:45.950
But then he said something that I hadn't thought of.

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:50.950
If we were to stand between Levi and the discipline he needs,

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:56.950
we would in effect be blocking an expression of Jehovah's love from reaching him.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:24:03.950
In fact, it's our very loyalty to Jehovah that could save his life.

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:08.950
We agreed to continue to put our trust in Jehovah and stay loyal to him.

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:33.009
It's been five years now.

00:24:33.009 --> 00:24:37.009
And while Levi still hasn't returned to Jehovah,

00:24:37.009 --> 00:24:40.009
I haven't given up hope on him.

00:24:40.009 --> 00:24:44.009
Until that day, I'm staying busy as a regular pioneer

00:24:44.009 --> 00:24:50.009
and focusing my energies on helping others learn about Jehovah.

00:24:50.009 --> 00:24:56.009
I've come to experience firsthand the truth of Psalm 9710.

00:24:57.009 --> 00:25:11.339
Jehovah really does guard his loyal ones.

00:25:11.339 --> 00:25:15.339
What helped Gabriela overcome this difficult challenge?

00:25:15.339 --> 00:25:19.339
For example, when she received a text message from her son,

00:25:19.339 --> 00:25:23.339
she applied scriptural counsel to her personal circumstances.

00:25:23.339 --> 00:25:27.339
The good example of Korra's sons gave her added motivation

00:25:27.339 --> 00:25:32.339
so as not to allow her feelings for her son to dictate her actions.

00:25:32.339 --> 00:25:37.339
Instead, she was firm in her loyalty to Jehovah.

00:25:37.339 --> 00:25:42.339
Also, her husband Ben had found an article that helped the two of them appreciate

00:25:42.339 --> 00:25:47.339
that they should make sure not to stand between Jehovah and their son Levi.

00:25:47.339 --> 00:25:53.339
Instead, they wanted Jehovah's expression of love to reach Levi.

00:25:53.339 --> 00:25:56.339
Whenever we are faced with the trial,

00:25:56.339 --> 00:26:00.339
we need to remember to pray constantly to Jehovah for guidance

00:26:00.339 --> 00:26:05.339
and to look for Jehovah's counsel in our literature and during our meetings.

00:26:05.339 --> 00:26:10.339
The Apostle Paul faced many challenges in his ministry.

00:26:10.339 --> 00:26:14.339
In 2 Corinthians chapter 11, starting in verse 23,

00:26:14.339 --> 00:26:19.339
he enumerates over 20 hardships that he experienced in his ministry.

00:26:19.339 --> 00:26:25.339
What helped Paul to keep his motivation strong despite everything he faced?

00:26:26.339 --> 00:26:28.339
In this morning, worship from Bethel,

00:26:28.339 --> 00:26:33.339
Brother John Echran highlights what Paul himself said kept him going.

00:26:33.339 --> 00:26:39.339
When you look at the words in the way that the Apostle Paul worded things,

00:26:39.339 --> 00:26:46.339
he said, I live by the faith in the Son of God who loved me and handed himself over for me.

00:26:46.339 --> 00:26:51.339
And we can really see the very personal nature of the ransom to the Apostle Paul.

00:26:51.339 --> 00:26:55.339
And it's important for us to do, as our commenters pointed out nicely,

00:26:55.339 --> 00:26:58.339
it is important for us to personalize the ransom.

00:26:58.339 --> 00:27:04.339
The Apostle Paul in Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 5 showed the very personal nature.

00:27:04.339 --> 00:27:09.339
He understood the personal nature of the Bible and the ransom.

00:27:09.339 --> 00:27:12.339
In Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 5,

00:27:12.339 --> 00:27:18.339
he uses this expression and who have tasted the fine word of God

00:27:18.339 --> 00:27:21.339
and powers of the coming system of things.

00:27:21.339 --> 00:27:23.339
It's interesting he used the word taste.

00:27:23.339 --> 00:27:25.339
Taste is something very personal.

00:27:25.339 --> 00:27:27.339
Somebody can't taste something for you.

00:27:27.339 --> 00:27:31.339
You have to put it in your mouth in order to really know what it's going to taste like.

00:27:31.339 --> 00:27:33.339
So too with the ransom.

00:27:33.339 --> 00:27:38.339
And what practical ways can we taste or personalize the ransom for us?

00:27:38.339 --> 00:27:41.339
Let's just consider a couple this morning.

00:27:41.339 --> 00:27:43.339
One is personal fears.

00:27:43.339 --> 00:27:45.339
Does God really love me?

00:27:45.339 --> 00:27:47.339
Am I worthy of love?

00:27:47.339 --> 00:27:51.339
Sometimes the what ifs and their cousins that could be,

00:27:51.339 --> 00:27:54.339
they come to live and never leave.

00:27:54.339 --> 00:27:58.339
You know, bad things or trials or difficulties happen to us.

00:27:58.339 --> 00:28:02.339
We begin to reason, well, Jehovah God maybe doesn't love me.

00:28:02.339 --> 00:28:06.339
There's a really strong reason for us to somehow believe in cause and effect.

00:28:06.339 --> 00:28:08.339
We see the cause of things and effect.

00:28:08.339 --> 00:28:10.339
And so after a while, everything that happens to us,

00:28:10.339 --> 00:28:16.339
we begin to look at some cause and even begin to think that maybe Jehovah doesn't love us.

00:28:17.339 --> 00:28:23.339
You can even if we're a good person and bad things happen to us, we begin to wonder.

00:28:23.339 --> 00:28:25.339
Others my age are healthy.

00:28:25.339 --> 00:28:28.339
Some leaving or changing assignments,

00:28:28.339 --> 00:28:32.339
you hear everything falls into place for them within a few weeks.

00:28:32.339 --> 00:28:34.339
I'm still looking for a job.

00:28:34.339 --> 00:28:36.339
I'm still looking for work.

00:28:36.339 --> 00:28:41.339
In other words, not try to reason that just because things don't work out perfectly

00:28:41.339 --> 00:28:44.339
that Jehovah doesn't love us, it's not true.

00:28:44.339 --> 00:28:50.339
We can still be doing very, very good things and yet some difficulties can face us.

00:28:50.339 --> 00:28:54.339
For example, you're driving down the road of being all the traffic laws.

00:28:54.339 --> 00:29:00.339
You pull up to a red light, you stop, turns green, you go through it and you get broadsided

00:29:00.339 --> 00:29:04.339
by some knucklehead who went through the red light on the other side.

00:29:04.339 --> 00:29:07.339
Well, that's not your fault.

00:29:07.339 --> 00:29:10.339
Are you going to say, well, you know what, I'm not going to be traffic laws anymore.

00:29:10.339 --> 00:29:12.339
See, it doesn't pay.

00:29:12.339 --> 00:29:14.339
Well, no.

00:29:14.339 --> 00:29:21.339
It was his fault for running through the traffic lights and sometimes bad or difficult things can happen to us.

00:29:21.339 --> 00:29:26.339
It's not our fault or it's not any sign that Jehovah doesn't love us.

00:29:26.339 --> 00:29:31.339
So how can reflecting on the ransom help us when we have these kinds of personal fears?

00:29:31.339 --> 00:29:34.339
Well, we could start with, why do we have the ransom?

00:29:34.339 --> 00:29:39.339
Well, because some very bad things were happening to some good people, us.

00:29:39.339 --> 00:29:41.339
Adam and Eve descendant.

00:29:41.339 --> 00:29:46.339
I mean, Adam sinned and Eve sinned yet we suffer.

00:29:46.339 --> 00:29:51.339
The ransom is Jehovah's solution for those who appreciate it.

00:29:51.339 --> 00:29:57.339
It's his way of telling us, I know bad things are happening and I'm working to fix it.

00:29:57.339 --> 00:30:02.339
Yes, when we reflect on the reason why Jehovah God gave us the ransom,

00:30:02.339 --> 00:30:08.339
it helps us to know that Jehovah knows we suffer from cancer and old age and the sins and mistakes of others

00:30:08.339 --> 00:30:11.339
and even our own imperfections.

00:30:11.339 --> 00:30:20.339
See, tasting of the ransom in this way means we'll not get the feeling that Jehovah doesn't love us when trials befall us.

00:30:20.339 --> 00:30:26.339
To the contrary, the ransom is the greatest expression of Jehovah and Jesus' love for us

00:30:26.339 --> 00:30:30.339
and their desire to fix the current mess we live in now.

00:30:30.339 --> 00:30:34.339
How about let's consider a second way that we could reflect on the ransom

00:30:34.339 --> 00:30:38.339
and that is the death of someone close to us?

00:30:38.339 --> 00:30:44.339
Anyone who's had someone very close to them die knows the very helpless feeling that you have,

00:30:44.339 --> 00:30:48.339
knowing that there's really nothing you can do.

00:30:48.339 --> 00:30:53.339
In that instant, when they die, your hope, your faith, in the resurrection,

00:30:53.339 --> 00:31:00.339
based on the ransom, become more real to you than any time in your entire life.

00:31:00.339 --> 00:31:07.339
In Acts chapter 17 and verse 31, in a beautiful speech that the Apostle Paul gave,

00:31:07.339 --> 00:31:16.339
he highlights that Jesus, death and resurrection and the ransom was really a guarantee that we have.

00:31:16.339 --> 00:31:20.339
Here in Acts chapter 17 and verse 31,

00:31:20.339 --> 00:31:26.339
he says, because he has set a day on which he purposes to judge the inhabited earth in righteousness

00:31:26.339 --> 00:31:37.339
by a man whom he is appointed, and he's provided a guarantee to all men by resurrecting him from the dead.

00:31:37.339 --> 00:31:45.339
So, personalizing the ransom, all that it makes possible, helps us to know that the resurrection is just not possible,

00:31:45.339 --> 00:31:54.339
but that Jehovah and Jesus want to resurrect our mother, our father, our beloved husband or a wife.

00:31:54.339 --> 00:31:59.339
They care about each person that has ever lived or died.

00:31:59.339 --> 00:32:08.339
Know them so intimately and so completely that they can resurrect them completely with all their memories and personality completely as we knew them.

00:32:08.339 --> 00:32:14.339
I mean, how much more personal could God's love for us become than that?

00:32:14.339 --> 00:32:18.339
You know, to bring our loved ones back from the dead

00:32:18.339 --> 00:32:27.339
is the ultimate statement of Jehovah's personal interest in each and every human being.

00:32:27.339 --> 00:32:33.339
We are not just collateral damage in Satan's war on Jehovah.

00:32:33.339 --> 00:32:43.339
The ransom is the way that Jehovah plans to undo all the harm that Satan has caused since the death of Adam and Eve.

00:32:43.339 --> 00:32:51.339
In fact, the resurrection is really Jehovah's way of proving all of Satan's lies completely a false.

00:32:51.339 --> 00:32:56.339
When you think about it today, Satan can portray all kinds of lies about what happens to people after they die.

00:32:56.339 --> 00:33:03.339
They're going to go here, they're going to go there, they're going to go to some afterlife, they're going to go to some paradise, they're going to come back as some animal.

00:33:03.339 --> 00:33:14.339
But in the new world, when the vast majority of people being resurrected, I've been resurrected, that lie isn't going to be sold anymore.

00:33:14.339 --> 00:33:18.339
Each one can tell everyone what happened to them when they died.

00:33:18.339 --> 00:33:29.690
Nothing. No afterlife. Everyone will know that it's non-existence. That lie won't work.

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:36.690
See, Jehovah knew that we would hurt terribly at the death of loved ones.

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:43.690
So he gave us the ransom. As his way of telling us, I know it hurts.

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:49.690
But please know that I have the perfect solution in mind.

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:56.690
Now, we've just considered two ways to reflect and meditate on the ransom, like the Apostle Paul did to really personalize it.

00:33:56.690 --> 00:34:04.690
We just talked about personal fears and the resurrection, the death of someone close to us.

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:15.690
Imagine how many more ways we can benefit today from meditating on the ransom and how it affects us personally.

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:20.690
As ministers of Jehovah, we take part in preaching the good news.

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:26.690
That good news includes the wonderful provision of the ransom Brother Ekran highlighted.

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:37.690
Have you ever participated in a preaching campaign? I'm sure you have enjoyed campaigns such as inviting our neighbors to the memorial or the regional convention.

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:46.690
On occasion, other campaigns are approved by the service committee of the governing body when there is a specific need in an area or language group.

00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:51.690
We bring you a report on a special campaign in Armenia.

00:34:51.690 --> 00:35:02.079
Armenia is an ancient country with rich history situated in the lands of Mount Ararat.

00:35:02.079 --> 00:35:09.130
In the Caucasus region, Lake Sivan is considered to be a prized jewel.

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:21.909
Diversity of its flora and fauna contribute to the unique and beautiful countryside.

00:35:21.909 --> 00:35:32.909
Yerevan, the capital, is a modern metropolis with picturesque views that remind many of Paris, with its trees, cafes, and beautiful water fountains.

00:35:32.909 --> 00:35:37.909
What is this? Yes, you don't know.

00:35:37.909 --> 00:35:44.510
Recently, a special three-week preaching campaign took place.

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:51.510
Groups of Armenia speaking Jehovah's Witnesses from six different countries wholeheartedly responded to the invitation.

00:35:51.510 --> 00:36:06.719
The main purpose of the campaign was to cover as many of the 512 unassigned territories as possible, with the Kingdom Good News.

00:36:06.719 --> 00:36:15.719
Thus, an opportunity for an interchange of encouragement was created for both the local friends and the campaign participants.

00:36:15.719 --> 00:36:22.349
They were warmly greeted at the airport by local brothers and sisters.

00:36:22.349 --> 00:36:35.860
The witnesses made good use of their tablets and smartphones to show videos from the JW.org website.

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:41.860
Armenia is also currently home to over 11,000 Western Armenia refugees.

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:52.860
A special effort was made to share with these individuals the positive message of hope and peace from the Bible in their native tongue, West Armenia.

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:58.860
Metropolitan witnessing served as an effective way to reach these ones.

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:04.860
It was the first time in my life that I participated in public witnessing, and it was very encouraging.

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:11.860
When individuals would approach us and show interest, I could explain to them the truth in their own language. It was amazing.

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:20.860
It's been very heartwarming. People have really responded well. They were in need of comfort and the good news, especially those that we came for.

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:27.860
The Western Armenians pretty much every door invited us in, and they were very hospitable and receptive.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:35.860
After we heard an announcement about a special campaign in a Western language that's going to take place in Armenia, we said we cannot miss this.

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:41.860
We have to be there and bring our share in this very joyful preaching campaign.

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:54.840
During the three-week campaign, over 15,000 pieces of Bible-based literature were left with interested ones, and over 200 Bible studies were started.

00:37:54.840 --> 00:38:03.840
We were very happy to see how many brothers and sisters were ready to come for the campaign in Armenia, from different countries around the world.

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:08.840
That response showed that Jehovah has blessed our efforts.

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:15.840
Those who came from far and wide greatly appreciated the share they had in this special event.

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:24.840
Everyone was so happy to see us, and when we were giving them a Bible, they were so excited to find answers from their own Bible.

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:31.840
I so blessed to be here. This has been the best vacation that we have had as a family.

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:41.840
The first time I came to Armenia, I was in 1982, and I looked for the witnesses, and I hardly found just a few.

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:52.840
But now that I came for this campaign, we have 11,000 witnesses. I'm really so happy. I really want to come back.

00:38:52.840 --> 00:39:02.840
It is our hope that Jehovah God continues to help all sorts of people to be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:17.099
While we enjoy relative freedom in many countries around the world, at times governments impose bans or restrictions on the preaching work.

00:39:17.099 --> 00:39:25.099
Brother Stefano's Densus serves as a special pioneer in Atis Ababa Ethiopia, along with his wife Leta Brahan.

00:39:25.099 --> 00:39:36.099
Their faith was tested during many years of adversity. What helped them champion the truth? Their story began and what is today Eritrea?

00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:43.340
Will it day?

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:52.340
I come from a family of nine children. I joined the Navy in 1956. That was during the time when Eritrea was part of Ethiopia.

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:59.340
My brother, Gebra Hewatt, asked me to come to Asmara. He was studying the Bible with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:07.340
I was so impressed with what he shared with me that for the rest of my vacation, Bible study became my priority.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:17.340
In time, I was discharged from the Navy and started working in Atis Ababa. So I was able to continue studying the Bible and get baptized.

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:19.340
Leta was also doing the same.

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:32.739
In 1960, I was attending a nursing college. There, a nurse shared some interesting thoughts with me from the Bible.

00:40:32.739 --> 00:40:44.739
Ten other student nurses also showed interest, but the college threatened us with dismissal because there was a ban on Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:40:44.739 --> 00:40:56.739
When we were shown from the Bible why true Christians are persecuted, we renewed our determination. Eventually, five of us were baptized.

00:40:56.739 --> 00:41:03.739
In time, I met Stefanus and we were married in 1964.

00:41:03.739 --> 00:41:14.739
Because of the ban, the brothers were meeting in small groups. Our trust was in Jehovah, and we made the preaching work a matter of prayer, confident that he would help us.

00:41:14.739 --> 00:41:19.739
We saw evidence of this with the underground production of the watchtower.

00:41:19.739 --> 00:41:27.739
Our brothers would have modest means, but they used what they had to buy a hand-operated duplicating machine which was used in our home.

00:41:27.739 --> 00:41:33.739
After returning from our second work, Leta and I would get busy making copies of the watchtower.

00:41:33.739 --> 00:41:37.739
We would play music, so our neighbors wouldn't hear the sound of the duplicator.

00:41:37.739 --> 00:41:44.460
In 1974, Emperor Haile Selassie was deposed.

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:53.460
This communist government quickly began a campaign called Red Terror against any supposed political opposer.

00:41:53.460 --> 00:42:00.460
Now, just having a typewriter or a duplicating machine could put you in prison or even have you killed.

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:08.780
Picking up a paper from the street with something printed on it against the government could put one's life in danger.

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:26.809
It was common for people to disappear. Sadly, my youngest brother, Eob, was a victim. He disappeared on his way home and was never seen again.

00:42:26.809 --> 00:42:34.809
With the situation being very dangerous, we were quite concerned raising our daughter Janet.

00:42:34.809 --> 00:42:40.809
But as we fully trusted in Jehovah, we felt his loving protection.

00:42:40.809 --> 00:42:44.809
In time to time, sections of the city were suddenly blockaded.

00:42:44.809 --> 00:42:51.809
This happened one morning as a translator was heading to our home to deliver stencils for printing.

00:42:51.809 --> 00:42:57.809
Urgently, he telephoned informing us that a house to house search was underway.

00:42:57.809 --> 00:43:04.809
Our house was full of publications, along with the duplicator and typewriters.

00:43:04.809 --> 00:43:09.809
Just after the phone call, three soldiers entered our compound to search.

00:43:09.809 --> 00:43:17.500
At that moment, I prayed silently that Jehovah would blind them.

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:24.500
Entering the room where the duplicator and stacks of freshly printed literature were, one soldier asked,

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:26.500
what is all this?

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:31.500
Oh, this is a duplicator that we use to print these Bible materials.

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:36.500
Completing his search, he went outside to the commander who asked him,

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.500
what did you find?

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:43.500
To our utter amazement, after seeing everything, he answered, nothing.

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:46.500
We won't find anything here.

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:53.500
In the late 1970s and into the early 80s, another wave of vicious persecution occurred.

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:59.500
A number of faithful brothers were imprisoned, tortured and murdered.

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:05.500
I was taken from my workplace because of my neutral stand and put in prison.

00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:12.500
When I think about living through those difficult times, I'm reminded of Isaiah 54, 17,

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:18.500
where Jehovah promised us, no weapon formed against you will have any success.

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:25.230
Finally, in 1991, a liberal government came to power.

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:30.989
They gave us legal recognition and freedom of worship.

00:44:30.989 --> 00:44:34.989
With these difficult, dangerous years now behind us,

00:44:34.989 --> 00:44:39.989
we were assigned to the circuit work in Eritrea and Ethiopia.

00:44:39.989 --> 00:44:44.750
By now, Eritrea was becoming an independent country,

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:47.750
and this brought about new challenges for the brothers.

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:52.750
Some young brothers were arrested and imprisoned because of their Christian stand.

00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:55.750
Paul wrote at Hebrews 13 verse 3,

00:44:55.750 --> 00:45:00.750
keeping mind those in prison, as though you were in prison with them.

00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:04.750
After enjoying the circuit work for 15 years,

00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:07.750
we faced another change.

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:12.750
We were invited to serve at Bethel as full-time commuters.

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:15.750
What has helped us to endure through the ban years,

00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:21.750
and to adjust to the many changes, is our spiritual study program.

00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:25.750
We're in full agreement with Jeremiah 17 verse 7.

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:30.750
Blessed is the man who puts his trust in Jehovah.

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:35.750
It also brings us much happiness to know that our daughter Janet

00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:40.750
has been serving as a regular pioneer for 20 years now.

00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:43.750
Each assignment has had its challenges,

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:46.750
but many rewards and blessings.

00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:49.750
I'm not young anymore. I'm 77 years old.

00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:52.750
And I'm 74 years old.

00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:55.750
We are now serving as special pioneers.

00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:58.750
When we think about all the changes that we've been through,

00:45:58.750 --> 00:46:01.750
we realize that the words of Isaiah 6, verse 8,

00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:05.750
here I am, send me, are not just for young people,

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:07.750
but for all of us.

00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:12.440
It is very encouraging to see,

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:18.440
Stefano Saint-Ledipurhan's determination to stay faithful to Jehovah come what may.

00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:23.440
We know that Jehovah looks with delight on their many years of service.

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:27.440
Some of our brothers in Canada underwent similar persecution.

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:30.440
How did Jehovah help them?

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:36.440
Pay special attention to the numerous acts of courage displayed by these champions of truth.

00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:42.010
Preaching in the province of Quebec was a real challenge.

00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:48.010
The Catholic Church was present in every sphere of public life.

00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:56.010
In the early 40s, the persecution took on quite a bit of emphasis.

00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:58.010
Many witnesses were being arrested.

00:46:58.010 --> 00:47:03.010
Any excuse was used, peddling without a license.

00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:05.010
This was a favorite excuse.

00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:11.010
Jehovah's Witnesses were put in prison whenever they were seen with religious literature.

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:17.010
It had got so bad in Quebec that it was decided to circulate a petition.

00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:24.010
And this petition was circulated throughout Canada and it called on the government of Quebec

00:47:24.010 --> 00:47:27.010
to put an end to this persecution.

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:33.010
And interestingly, some 600,000 people signed the petition.

00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:41.010
The witnesses distributed a very fiery track called the Burning Hade of Quebec.

00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:45.010
And in this track, they showed what was really happening.

00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:51.010
The actions of the policemen, the illegal arrests, the mob action.

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:57.010
Within four months, there was 800 new court cases.

00:47:57.010 --> 00:48:04.010
So here for 400 Jehovah's Witnesses, you had 1,600 court cases.

00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:13.010
The seriousness of the court cases increased in that now they were accusing the brothers of sedition.

00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:17.010
If convicted, it was more than 10, maybe 12 or 15 years in prison.

00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:24.010
We have one brother, Amy Boucher, who was arrested and charged with sedition.

00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:30.010
Amy Boucher was a very poor brother, lived in a rural part of Quebec.

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:36.010
And he actually went to court with his ox and buggy.

00:48:36.010 --> 00:48:39.010
And on the way to court, he was preaching.

00:48:39.010 --> 00:48:41.010
So he was arrested again.

00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:44.010
They had the court hearing and he was condemned.

00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:47.010
He was found guilty of sedition.

00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:50.010
And his case went up to the court of appeal.

00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:54.010
And at that time, the court of appeal of Quebec was very hostile.

00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:56.010
And he lost on appeal.

00:48:56.010 --> 00:49:00.010
So it went up to the Supreme Court of Canada.

00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:07.010
And by this time, there were several other brothers and sisters also charged on sedition.

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:15.010
Which meant that if he lost his case, we had several going to prison for very lengthy prison terms.

00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:23.010
When brother Boucher's case came before the Supreme Court, he lost by majority of one.

00:49:23.010 --> 00:49:26.010
The Catholic judges all ruled against him.

00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:32.010
And they found that the track, the burning hate of Quebec was seditious.

00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:38.010
Our lawyers looked at the situation, prayed about it, and thought, what can we do?

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:40.010
We can't lose this battle.

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:48.010
And they realized that in Canada, there was a very rarely used provision of asking the Supreme Court for a rehearing.

00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:55.010
At the rehearing, one of the Catholic judges was willing to discuss further the issue of sedition.

00:49:55.010 --> 00:50:02.010
And to be guilty of sedition, you have to incite to violence.

00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:07.010
So our attorney asked them, please, look at the record.

00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:12.010
Show the court where Jehovah's Witnesses incited to violence.

00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:15.010
And finally, they were able to convince the court they were wrong.

00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:18.010
And so they overturned their initial decision.

00:50:18.010 --> 00:50:23.010
And brother Boucher's case was victorious.

00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:32.010
This dealt with all the accusations of sedition and really brought to an end the vicious opposition.

00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:38.010
Because that case was the one the government was hoping would work out for them.

00:50:38.010 --> 00:50:42.010
There is one case that's quite noteworthy in Quebec.

00:50:42.010 --> 00:50:52.010
And it's a case of the priests calling up the federal police to come and interrupt a meeting of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:58.010
And expel the speaker from the province of Quebec.

00:50:58.010 --> 00:51:02.010
Police obeyed the priests. They went to the meeting.

00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:07.010
They took the brother and they escorted him out of the province into Ontario.

00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:11.010
And to disrupt a religious meeting was a criminal act.

00:51:11.010 --> 00:51:15.010
For the first time, and it's at the level of the Supreme Court,

00:51:15.010 --> 00:51:24.010
they found that the two policemen had to pay moral damages to the brothers for intercepting or interrupting the meeting.

00:51:24.010 --> 00:51:26.010
This has never happened before.

00:51:26.010 --> 00:51:33.010
And when it came up to the Supreme Court, the unanimously ruled against the province of Quebec.

00:51:33.010 --> 00:51:39.010
The section on religious freedom is the result of these court cases.

00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:47.010
Every lawyer in Canada, whether in Quebec or in English Canada, when he studies law must review these cases.

00:51:47.010 --> 00:51:51.010
They are the fundamentals of religious freedom.

00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:59.010
And they represent the different areas, police action, government action, criminal action.

00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:06.010
And they lay a very nice basis for our freedoms today.

00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:13.010
Our purpose is to be able to preach the good news and to direct people's attention toward the Bible.

00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:26.010
But our court cases have helped governments, courts, judges and officials to have the right point of view on the issue of religious freedom.

00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:33.829
The endurance and hard work of our brothers in Quebec truly resulted in a witness to the nations.

00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:44.829
While the hope for a positive outcome can at times provide us with needed motivation, we can't always expect support from the authorities in this system of things.

00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:49.829
The same applies in many areas of life, whatever trials we may face.

00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:52.829
Perhaps you have lost a loved one and death.

00:52:52.829 --> 00:52:56.829
Looking forward to a time just around the corner can help us endure.

00:52:56.829 --> 00:53:02.829
That's also the title of this month's music video, just around the corner.

00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:21.980
You can hear the songbird singing and you watch the clouds roll by.

00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:29.980
Then you're walking in the valley as the sun shines in a clear blue sky.

00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:35.980
You're welcoming your loved ones and you can't believe.

00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:44.670
Yes, this earthly paradise was just around the corner.

00:53:44.670 --> 00:54:00.980
There's a house down in the valley and a house high on the very singing by the river.

00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:08.980
As the water flows and turns the milk, the golden fields are waiting.

00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:13.980
Let the harvesting begin.

00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:22.349
Once the world we're living, it was just around the corner.

00:54:22.349 --> 00:54:30.349
It's great to share with friends who care the things that we looked forward to.

00:54:30.349 --> 00:54:34.349
Now every tear has disappeared.

00:54:34.349 --> 00:54:38.349
The world is young and life is new.

00:54:38.349 --> 00:54:45.349
There's the sound of happy voices and the scent of new morn hay.

00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:54.349
Now you're calling to your loved ones as you start another perfect day.

00:54:54.349 --> 00:55:02.469
Then we thank our poorest tender.

00:55:02.469 --> 00:55:10.469
Yes, the blessings we all share were just around the corner.

00:55:10.469 --> 00:55:18.469
And every day smile and say how good to see your happy face.

00:55:18.469 --> 00:55:26.469
Once it seemed I only dreamed that you'd be in my warm embrace.

00:55:26.469 --> 00:55:33.469
Waiting round the corner is a world I long to see.

00:55:33.469 --> 00:55:37.469
It's a promise from Jehovah.

00:55:37.469 --> 00:55:49.469
It's a guarantee reality and it's hard to get downhearted when I think of what's in store.

00:55:49.469 --> 00:55:57.469
It's the day I'm waiting for and it's just around the corner.

00:55:57.469 --> 00:56:12.380
What a beautiful song.

00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:16.380
Personally, I lost my father when I was two years old.

00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:20.380
He was a soldier in World War II and was killed in battle.

00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:24.380
I never had an opportunity to get to know him.

00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:29.380
Growing up, I am missed having a father because I saw everyone else's head one.

00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:35.380
So I look forward to observing the earthly resurrection and seeing my physical father.

00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:41.380
And I hope that both he and my mother will want to worship Jehovah in paradise.

00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:44.380
Thank you for sharing that for the lotion.

00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:50.380
When my father comes back in the resurrection, I look forward to welcoming him with open arms.

00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:54.380
He was a keen student of history and the Bible.

00:56:54.380 --> 00:56:58.380
And so he will want to know all about what took place during this time of the end.

00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:03.380
So my family and I will have a good time filling him in on what took place.

00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:09.380
This music video and some of the videos we've seen the past few years at regional conventions

00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:13.380
have painted such a clear picture of the hope we have for the future.

00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:20.380
And if we work hard as champions of the truth, that hope will become a reality very soon.

00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:22.380
Well said.

00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:30.380
And speaking of champions of the truth, we would like to conclude this program with greetings from our brothers and sisters in Romania.

00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:34.380
A country situated in the southeast of Europe.

00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:40.380
Some of you may know Romania for its traditional instrument called the Nai or Panflute.

00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:46.380
It's made of wood and has around 20 pipes arranged in a curved array.

00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:51.380
The pitch is adjusted with beeswax, which is introduced in the pipes.

00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:58.380
The brothers and sisters in the Chatez in North Congregation, in the north of Romania, send us their love.

00:57:58.380 --> 00:58:07.380
The Congregation is located near the Ukrainian border, an area known for its brightly colored folk costumes.

00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:12.380
The Congregation is made up of families with many generations of witnesses,

00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:16.380
so they have been champions of truth for a long time.

00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:24.380
The truth reached this area about 80 years ago, and now the Congregation is made up of 126 publishers.

00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:29.380
They conduct about 90 Bible studies, of which many attend the meetings.

00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:34.380
Because there is a large concentration of witnesses in the area,

00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:41.380
the Congregation territories only five kilometers, or a little over three miles from the one end to the other.

00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:45.380
Each territory card has only about five houses.

00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:55.380
Because of that, the Congregation regularly assists with working territory up to 200 kilometers, or about 124 miles away.

00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:59.380
The brothers and sisters of the Chatez in North Congregation,

00:58:59.380 --> 00:59:02.380
send all of you champions of the truth.

00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:07.380
They are love and greetings, and so do all of us at World Headquarters.

00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:11.380
This is JW Broadcasting in Brooklyn, New York.
