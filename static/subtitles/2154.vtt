00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:05.230
Take a moment now and picture the scene

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.230
Up ahead on the path or what seemed to be

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.230
Children laughing at play

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.230
In a world free of the fears we once faced

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.230
And taking care of this beautiful earth

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.230
Are a people that live by our father's words

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.229
Until the moon is no more

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:36.229
There is the peace we have been waiting for

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:49.270
Both feel his love is on our new world

00:00:49.270 --> 00:01:11.260
To cause us for trains like a sun

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:18.109
As we see ourselves in our new world

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:30.269
To take a moment now and think of our place

00:01:30.269 --> 00:01:33.269
By the mountains and rivers

00:01:33.269 --> 00:01:35.269
Or wide open plains

00:01:35.269 --> 00:01:38.269
It's a place to call home

00:01:38.269 --> 00:01:42.709
And now walking in through your front

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:47.400
There is someone that you know

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.480
Holding out his own

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.689
Hopped here full in breath

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.450
Feels like forever since you've been faint

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.420
And that won't stop

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.969
Falled out, stretched out

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:59.680
New like a sun

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.680
He sent it out

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.680
Jehovah's will for this earth

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.680
Fulfilling every living things I wish

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:57.599
Our star knew
