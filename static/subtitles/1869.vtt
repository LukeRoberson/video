00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.570
I worked in an office in the financial district.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.850
I enjoyed everything about working there.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.050
Passing these tall skyscrapers, institutions with big names,

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.050
in terms of what I wanted from life.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.449
At that time it was great.

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.049
Spiritually it was not the best at all.

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:34.850
You have to make yourself stand out.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.450
That really affected my personality.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.390
I didn't even realise it at the time.

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:47.789
I was pioneering and I decided to apply for Bethel and was accepted.

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.990
And my assignment was to do cleaning.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.189
And from my background that kind of work,

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:55.590
it was something that was looked down on.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.590
It's not something you would choose to do.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.590
I was used to an environment where,

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.189
if you did well, you could move to the next step

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:04.390
and you'd be recognised for it.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.590
And this was the case for me,

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.790
that I derived so much value from these external things,

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.189
these privileges and being set apart from others.

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.189
I thrived on that commendation,

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.790
both at work and in the congregation.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.390
So when you don't get it, then you feel lost a little bit.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.989
Other brothers were getting more recognition.

00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:29.849
And that just played in my head a little bit.

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:34.650
The spiritual environment in Bethel has taught me and is teaching me

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.250
that our value is nothing to do with the privileges that we enjoy.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.450
When we feed off the recognition from men,

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.450
it's almost like we're chasing the next compliment or the next praise.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.849
You can always feel like you're chasing happiness.

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:58.650
But switching my thinking to thinking about Jehovah's recognition,

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.049
it gives you more peace and it's more sustainable.

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.650
And it really helped me to see that,

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.650
no matter what circumstances I'm in,

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.650
I can be happy, I can be joyful.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.449
He's been good-molding.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.199
Sandy and I got married in 2003.

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:29.199
Sandy was pioneering back then and I was happy to support her.

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:32.400
Then we found out that we were expecting a baby,

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.000
and we were really excited.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.599
I still was hoping that after I had the baby

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.800
that I would be able to continue pioneering,

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.400
that was the plan anyway.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.400
We just thought to ourselves,

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.599
we can grow them up, they can serve Jehovah, go to Bethel,

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.800
all of the stuff that you want your child to do.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.400
One day, very late on in the pregnancy,

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.599
I received a phone call from Sandy.

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.800
She was rushed into hospital for an emergency cesarean

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.900
and everything changed.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.900
We're so glad that he made it through.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.500
And thankfully, he survived.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.300
Later on, we found out that he had

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.900
severe brain damage.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.099
We had to learn how to operate medical machinery,

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:24.500
we had to learn what's the range was,

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.099
we had to learn so much stuff

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.500
that we'd never even had to think about before.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.500
So I used to feel like

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.900
why was our path to get to the new world harder

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.900
than other brothers and sisters?

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.099
I felt isolated and lonely

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.099
because I felt that no one understood

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.300
what I was going through and what it felt like.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.300
No one around me was in my situation.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.300
We really enjoyed the assembly.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.300
We'd sit near the front,

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.099
we could focus on what was going on,

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.300
and all of a sudden, Eden's born, we're at the back.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.300
We're right at the back.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.300
It was very, very hard to accept

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.099
that although I wanted to be somewhere

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:15.699
at a certain time spiritually,

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:17.899
it just wasn't going to happen

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:24.930
because I was in a completely different situation.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.129
Eden now has a little sister, Angel,

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:30.730
who is also a blessing from Jehovah.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.329
Although our goals in life changed,

00:04:34.329 --> 00:04:36.730
and we might not be as a do as much as we used to do,

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.129
we know that Jehovah is really appreciative on

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:42.730
everything that we do.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.529
And as a family, we've set a goal,

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:48.129
being out in the ministry together at least once a month.

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:52.129
It takes a lot to get Eden ready for his lot of preparation

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:53.930
and a lot of medication,

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.730
and there's a lot of hidden things

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.329
that the congregation don't see.

00:04:58.329 --> 00:05:04.930
We know that Jehovah's seen us struggling in the evenings.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.930
He's looking there at the sleepless night.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.329
He can help you to cope,

00:05:09.329 --> 00:05:12.529
to be happy with small blessings.

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:13.930
I don't do it every day,

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.730
but I try to write down what I'm grateful for,

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.129
what Jehovah's given me.

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:22.329
And this really helps me not only to be focused

00:05:22.329 --> 00:05:24.529
but to have more appreciative prayers

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:28.129
to Jehovah about what he's doing for me now.

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:31.129
We know that Jehovah values our family.
