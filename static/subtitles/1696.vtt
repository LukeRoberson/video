00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.869
Soccer was my reason for living.

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:11.869
I was dreamed of becoming a professional soccer player.

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:19.420
I thought that happiness comes from pain.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.940
A good career.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.660
Money.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.840
When I was six, my parents signed me up for soccer.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.840
I really loved playing soccer.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.840
It's been all my time at the stadium, even laid into the night.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.840
When I was 12, I learned about Jehovah from my mom.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.840
At that time, she started studying the Bible.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.840
And after about a year, I began to preach from door to door.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.840
When I was 17 years old, I finished school

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.840
and I received an invitation from the Dynamo Soccer Club in Kiev.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.119
Oh, that was unforgettable.

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:06.120
Yes, my emotions were running high because since childhood,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.120
I always dreamed of playing for Dynamo.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:20.040
From that moment on, all my energy and all my time were devoted to my career.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:36.780
Every day, we either trained or there was a game.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.780
There was no time left for spiritual things.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.370
Of course, being around people like that, I became just like them.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:54.239
I led in a moral lifestyle because huge amounts of money

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:56.239
opened up many opportunities.

00:01:56.239 --> 00:02:00.989
Going to nightclubs.

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:02.989
The nightlife.

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:05.989
It was so immoral.

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:08.990
Everyone wants to be your friend, to meet you.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:20.900
And of course, this was done thing.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.900
I also invested huge sums of money in real estate.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.900
I wanted to create a foundation for the future

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.900
and wealth for myself, my family and my relatives,

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.900
so that no one would be in need.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.900
Yes, I was sure that this really was happiness.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.240
This continued for nine years.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.240
The turning point was a conversation with management

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.240
when an issue came up.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.240
And they hurled insults at me.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.240
At that moment, I felt worthless, like a disposable cup

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:59.240
that you use, then crush and throw away.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.240
Besides, a new generation of soccer players was arriving.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.240
Many young guys.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.240
I stopped being included in the starting lineup.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.780
Also, the financial crisis began.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.780
And real estate prices fell drastically.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.780
I panicked.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.780
I didn't know what to do.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.780
And I started to think about the meaning of life.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.780
What really is the meaning of life?

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.780
If it's not a career, not money, and what is it?

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.780
And then I remembered everything that I learned about Jehovah

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.780
when I was a teenager.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.780
I began to study the Bible again, along with my wife.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.780
After a year, I started preaching again.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.780
And in 2009, I was baptized as one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.780
And this brought me so much joy and satisfaction.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.780
These feelings can't be compared to winning any medal or cup.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.599
I realized that I couldn't slave for two masters.

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:06.599
But I still had to play two more years for dynamo Kiev.

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:12.879
Although it was a difficult time, I took advantage of this opportunity.

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:18.879
And I'm thankful to Jehovah that a good witness was given about his name.

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:23.879
There were some soccer players who showed interest in the truth.

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:30.879
In 2011, when my contract ended, I finished my professional career.

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:34.879
First Timothy chapter 6 encourages us to place our hope,

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:41.879
not on uncertain riches, but on God, and to be rich and fine works.

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:44.879
People ask me, do you regret it?

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:46.879
Maybe you'd like to come back?

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:47.879
Do you miss soccer?

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:51.879
And I honestly and sincerely say no.

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:54.879
I don't miss it, and I don't want to go back.

00:04:54.879 --> 00:05:00.879
Because my relationship with Jehovah can't be compared to anything.

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:04.879
Everything that this world offers is all short-lived.

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:06.879
And it's only an illusion.

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:11.879
People see only one side of the picture, the fame, the money.

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:15.879
The other side is the injures, disappointments.

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:18.879
It's very hard psychologically and emotionally.

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:21.879
You have no freedom.

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:27.879
That's why it's better to give the very best to the one who appreciates it.

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:33.879
What you do for Jehovah will always bring you happiness, joy, and satisfaction.
