00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.619
I regularly visit my mother to clean the house to prepare meals.

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:13.619
Well, just to spend some time with her.

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:21.620
A criminal case was initiated against Vitaly's mother Olga Opolova, a November 12, 2018.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:28.620
A November 25th, officers raided her apartment and the homes of three other fellow believers.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.619
She was 66 years old at the time.

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:37.619
They used Elzor to break through my door.

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:40.619
They asked me, why didn't you open up?

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:46.619
I couldn't answer them because just the night before I had had a heart attack.

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:55.619
Neither Olga's age nor her health condition stopped the law enforcement officer's cruel and inhumane treatment.

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:59.619
One of the officers called the investigator.

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:04.620
They told him what happened and that they had called an ambulance.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:11.620
Anyway, the investigator said, bring her in for interrogation, so they did.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.620
Olga spent the next two days in a temporary detention facility.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.620
After I had the heart attack, I of course felt very ill.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.620
They handcuffed me, took me to court and put me into that cage.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:32.620
The court ordered Olga to be placed under house arrest.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:42.620
She is accused of discussing Bible topics with people and these kinds of conversations are interpreted by the investigation as recruitment.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:50.620
The prosecution doesn't deny the fact that Olga Opolova has done no harm, no real harm to anyone.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.620
On October 10, 2019, Olga had to return to court.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.620
When the Federal Penitentiary Service Vehicle arrived to take her to court, she suffered a stroke.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:08.620
Olga was eventually taken by ambulance to a local hospital and placed in intensive care.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.620
According to her medical records, when she was admitted to the hospital, she was in critical condition.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.620
At the time of her stroke, she was under house arrest.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.620
But to say that I was worried when I saw her in that condition, would be putting it mildly.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:30.620
When our eyes met, the first thing she did was smile, then she cried.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:38.620
A few days after Olga had the stroke, her only son, Vitaly Ilyinich, was detained.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.620
All of this litigation began with the criminal prosecution of my mother and now it has affected me.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.620
The court imposed a restriction in the form of a reconnaissance agreement on Vitaly.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.620
Now both mother and son are named in criminal cases because of their faith.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:03.620
As the investigator told me, if you remained one of Jehovah's Witnesses, in essence, then you are an extremist.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:10.620
The investigator refused to listen when I tried to explain the difference between faith and the legal entity.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.620
He said, that doesn't interest me at all.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.620
I'm just doing my job. I am told what to do and I do it.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.620
It's absurd to accuse people like Olga and Vitaly of activities of an extremist nature.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:35.620
It is becoming a standard practice among law enforcement agencies to inflate the statistics of their so-called successful fight against extremism by prosecuting peaceful religious believers.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.620
Often when investigators have accused somebody, they subsequently bring charges against his relatives.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.620
Olga and Vitaly do not intend to give up and the persecution has not caused their faith in God to waver.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.620
Better to be in prison with God than to be free without God.
