00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:04.459
Welcome to JW Broadcasting.

00:00:04.459 --> 00:00:06.459
What do we have in store for you?

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:08.460
Here are some highlights.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.460
D.D. Brown lost her daughter in an unimaginable tragedy.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.460
How did Jehovah comfort her?

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.460
Racial and national prejudice is hard to overcome for some people.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.460
We'll go to Greece and see a beautiful example of impartial love in action.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.460
And our new song reminds us that when we make time for Jehovah,

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.460
we feel his presence in our life.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.460
This is JW Broadcasting for March 2022.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:01:04.980
There's no doubt that we're living in critical times hard to deal with,

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:11.980
just as the Apostle Paul prophesied under inspiration in 2 Timothy chapter 3.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:22.980
Many times we've read Matthew chapter 24, Mark 13, Luke 21, and Revelation chapter 6.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:30.980
But who would ever have known how deeply a pandemic, so-called natural disasters,

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:40.980
violence, and unrest would affect us economically, physically, and even emotionally?

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.980
Some of you dear friends face unimaginable hardships.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:54.980
Many have experienced lost-of-love ones, imprisonment, physical abuse, sickness, financial problems,

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:01.980
and sometimes a number of these or other circumstances all at the same time.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.980
You dear brothers and sisters are in our prayers.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.979
With this in mind, the theme for our program is,

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.979
in difficult times, Jehovah always comforts.

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:25.979
A scripture that's become familiar to Jehovah's people is 2 Corinthians chapter 1, verses 3 and 4.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:30.979
Praise be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:39.979
the Father of tender mercies, and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our trials,

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:47.979
so that we may be able to comfort others in any sort of trial, with the comfort that we receive from God.

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:55.979
The study Bible says this regarding the expression, the Father of tender mercies.

00:02:56.979 --> 00:03:05.979
The Greek noun rendered tender mercies is here used to describe a feeling of compassion or pity for others.

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:15.979
God is called the Father or the source of tender mercies because compassion emanates from Him and is part of His nature.

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:26.449
Such tender feelings move Him to act mercifully in behalf of His faithful servants who are suffering tribulation.

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:32.449
Regarding the phrase, the God of all comfort, it continues.

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:37.449
The Greek noun here rendered comfort literally means, a calling to one's side.

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:46.449
It conveys the idea of standing next to a person, helping or encouraging Him when His undergoing trials are feeling sad.

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:57.449
God uses His powerful active force to give comfort and help, in situations that from a human viewpoint seem hopeless.

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.449
Think about what that means.

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:10.449
Jehovah wants us to know that whatever we face, He is by our side helping us when we're undergoing any sort of trial.

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:21.449
No, He did not promise that He'd remove our trials, rather He eases our misery or grief whenever we undergo difficulties.

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:30.449
What a beautiful word picture of God standing next to us, especially when things seem hopeless.

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:38.449
We invite you to do a personal study project using the publication Research Guide for Jehovah's Witnesses

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:44.449
or the Watchtower Online Library. Do a word search on comfort.

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:56.459
You'll be drawn even closer to Jehovah and appreciate His unmatched desire and ability to comfort.

00:04:56.459 --> 00:05:03.459
Jehovah also inspired Paul to show how He would stand by us to comfort us.

00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:09.459
Notice Romans chapter 15 and verse 4.

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:24.459
For all the things that were written beforehand, were written for our instruction so that through our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures, we might have hope.

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:27.459
Comfort from the Scriptures.

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:33.459
Time limits us from going into all the ways that the Bible does this.

00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:36.459
But let's take some examples.

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:52.100
A scripture that Jehovah's people have often meditated on in recent times is found in Jeremiah chapter 29, when Jehovah inspired Jeremiah to convey His message to the Jews.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:58.100
They had been taken from Jerusalem and were captives in Babylon.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:06.100
They were downhearted. But even while in captivity, Jehovah provided a comforting message.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:11.100
Notice His words in Jeremiah chapter 29, verse 10.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:18.100
When 70 years at Babylon are fulfilled, I will turn my attention to you.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:25.100
God told these Jewish exiles that they would remain in captivity for a long time.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:31.100
Then He made clear to them that He had a peaceful future in mind.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.100
The latter part of that verse says,

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:39.100
And I will make good by promise by bringing you back to this place.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.100
In verse 11, He says,

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:53.100
I will know the thoughts that I am thinking toward you, declares Jehovah, thoughts of peace, and not of calamity, to give you a future and a hope.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:58.100
God did make good on His promise to those Israelites.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.100
He let them know that their future was to be a bright one.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:10.100
Regarding Jeremiah 29, 11, one commentary states,

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:21.100
it is difficult to find a more wonderful promise anywhere in Scripture that expresses the tender compassion of Yahweh, Jehovah.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:30.100
Toward these exiles and setting before them at last a real reason for optimism and expectation.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:37.100
Jehovah's promise strengthened men such as Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:45.100
Jehovah reassured the Jews by repeating His promise at Jeremiah chapter 31, verse 17.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.100
And there is a hope for your future.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:53.100
Your sons will return to their own territory.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:58.100
Sure enough, just as Jehovah foretold,

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:06.100
Babylon was conquered by the Persian king Cyrus, who allowed the exiles to return to their homeland.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:11.100
After 70 years of captivity, they were back in Jerusalem.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:16.100
Jehovah made good on His promise.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:20.100
What does that have to do with us today?

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:32.100
The fulfilled promises of Jehovah assure us that His promises to us will come true in spite of surrounding circumstances, as He said,

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.100
I will make good my promise.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.100
How comforting to know that.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:47.100
But we know that the greatest expression of Jehovah's comfort is His only begotten Son, Jesus.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:51.100
During His time on earth He gave people hope.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:09:03.100
Jesus engaged in a marvelous ministry, healing the sick, performing powerful works, and most important, teaching people about God's kingdom.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:11.100
However, the greatest expression of hope to us humans is Jesus' ransom sacrifice.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:27.409
Through His inspired word, we can see that Jehovah assures us that He not only understands what we face, but also desires to console and strengthen us.

00:09:27.409 --> 00:09:41.409
Our loving Heavenly Father especially watches over all who endeavor to do His will, but in all of His mercy He also draws humble people who may not yet know Him.

00:09:41.409 --> 00:09:50.409
How many of us were in dire straits only to be introduced to the truth and to get to know Jehovah at the right time?

00:09:50.409 --> 00:09:53.409
That was no coincidence.

00:09:53.409 --> 00:10:00.409
That's a consequence of Jehovah's love, and His desire to give people comfort through the hope He provides.

00:10:00.409 --> 00:10:09.549
Dear brothers and sisters, as we get closer to the Great Tribulation,

00:10:10.549 --> 00:10:19.549
we will face more distressing circumstances, and during the Great Tribulation, our trust in Jehovah must be solid.

00:10:19.549 --> 00:10:25.549
We need to be sensitive and receptive to the ways in which He consoles and strengthens us.

00:10:25.549 --> 00:10:33.549
We need to keep in mind what Paul says at 2 Corinthians 1 verse 4, perhaps even memorizing it.

00:10:34.549 --> 00:10:43.659
Jehovah is a God who comforts us in all our trunks.

00:10:43.659 --> 00:10:56.659
Some time ago, we interviewed two long-time members of the United States Bethel family, Brother Gerald Grizzle, a helper to the Personnel Committee, and Brother Sam Robertson.

00:10:56.659 --> 00:11:01.659
These two brothers served as traveling overseers for many years prior to coming to Bethel.

00:11:01.659 --> 00:11:10.659
Brother Grizzle has served at Bethel since 1978, and Brother Robertson has served here for nearly 20 years.

00:11:10.659 --> 00:11:17.659
They've been assigned by the governing body to assist them in shepherding the United States Bethel family.

00:11:17.659 --> 00:11:24.659
Shepherding the Bethel family, you may ask after all, Bethelites don't have any distressing trials.

00:11:24.659 --> 00:11:28.659
Listen to what our dear brothers have to say.

00:11:28.659 --> 00:11:34.659
Brother Grizzle, what are some of the challenges that members of the Bethel family face?

00:11:34.659 --> 00:11:41.659
The worldwide Bethel family is a representation of the Brotherhood.

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:56.659
By that, I mean that just as 1 Peter chapter 5 verse 9 says, they face the same kind of sufferings being experienced by the entire association of our brothers in the world.

00:11:56.659 --> 00:12:03.659
Some deal with serious health problems, but they continue to serve.

00:12:04.659 --> 00:12:14.659
Others have concerns over aging parents, and some have to give up their beloved Bethel service.

00:12:14.659 --> 00:12:32.659
Still others contend with bounce of depression, but they spirit of these dear brothers and sisters impels them to have the determination not to allow these challenges to dominate them.

00:12:32.659 --> 00:12:40.659
Rather, their faith in Jehovah's strengthens their resolve to focus on their assignments.

00:12:40.659 --> 00:12:48.659
Thank you for that insight, Brother Grizzle. Brother Robertson, how have you been able to comfort such ones?

00:12:48.659 --> 00:12:55.659
When we find out a Bethelite is going through a tragedy, there are four things that we do.

00:12:55.659 --> 00:13:04.659
Number one, we pray for them and develop specific spiritual points according to their needs.

00:13:04.659 --> 00:13:07.659
And that's before we make the call.

00:13:07.659 --> 00:13:12.659
Number two, when we actually make the call, we really listen.

00:13:12.659 --> 00:13:15.659
And I don't mean we just listen with our ears.

00:13:15.659 --> 00:13:23.659
We try to listen with our hearts. We try to feel what they feel. We try to have compassion.

00:13:23.659 --> 00:13:33.659
Number three, when we use God's word to remind them they're not facing their crisis alone, this is very effective.

00:13:33.659 --> 00:13:39.659
As an example, we called on a brother recently who was going through a great trial.

00:13:39.659 --> 00:13:45.659
And we shared among other things Exodus chapter three and verse seven and 12.

00:13:45.659 --> 00:13:47.659
Let's take a look at that.

00:13:47.659 --> 00:13:52.659
I have certainly seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt.

00:13:52.659 --> 00:13:57.659
And I've heard their outcry because of those who forced them to work.

00:13:57.659 --> 00:14:01.659
And note the ending point here. It's very beautiful.

00:14:01.659 --> 00:14:06.659
Jehovah doesn't say I know how my people feel.

00:14:06.659 --> 00:14:11.659
He says, I will know the pains of my people.

00:14:12.659 --> 00:14:20.659
And then in giving assurance, dealing with Moses fearing to go before Pharaoh in verse 12,

00:14:20.659 --> 00:14:28.659
just the a part to this, he said, I will prove to be with you.

00:14:28.659 --> 00:14:39.659
Just a few words, but so powerful where Jehovah is guaranteeing that he's going to give them undeniable proof

00:14:39.659 --> 00:14:44.659
that he's backing them up and never moving away from them one inch.

00:14:44.659 --> 00:14:46.659
And this gives us comfort.

00:14:46.659 --> 00:14:56.659
Now number four, before we conclude the call, we have an ending prayer with them and we use their names.

00:14:56.659 --> 00:15:01.659
And this is very comforting since we're calling on Jehovah the great shepherd.

00:15:01.659 --> 00:15:10.659
At first, Thessalonians 5, 14, Paul says we urge you, brothers, to speak consolingly to those who are depressed,

00:15:10.659 --> 00:15:14.659
to support the weak, be patient toward all.

00:15:14.659 --> 00:15:17.659
And this is exactly what we're trying to do.

00:15:17.659 --> 00:15:20.659
Thanks for sharing those thoughts. Very interesting.

00:15:20.659 --> 00:15:27.659
Brothers, Grisel and Roberson, how has comforting others affected you?

00:15:27.659 --> 00:15:29.659
Brother Grisel, first, please.

00:15:29.659 --> 00:15:36.659
During these challenging times, I sense Jehovah's love for his people.

00:15:36.659 --> 00:15:46.659
Over the years, I have seen and experienced his care when facing difficult times.

00:15:46.659 --> 00:15:57.659
Some years ago, I lost my mother, my brother, and my father in death all within a year.

00:15:58.659 --> 00:16:10.659
And in 2017, I lost my dear wife, Bonnie, after we had served Jehovah together for nearly 65 years.

00:16:10.659 --> 00:16:18.659
But with my prayer, research, and love of the friends, Jehovah has comforted me.

00:16:18.659 --> 00:16:24.659
And now, thankfully, I have been able to offer encouragement to others.

00:16:24.659 --> 00:16:27.659
Very touching, brother Grisel. Thank you.

00:16:27.659 --> 00:16:32.659
Brother Roberson, how has comforting others affected you?

00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:39.659
One of the most memorable challenges was while my wife, Linda and I were in the circuit work several years ago.

00:16:39.659 --> 00:16:48.659
I lost my voice. I had to have surgery on my vocal cords, and for six weeks, I could not talk.

00:16:48.659 --> 00:16:53.659
For a circuit overseer, that's like being a bird without its wings.

00:16:53.659 --> 00:16:59.659
I wrote more notes in that six weeks than I had written in my whole life.

00:16:59.659 --> 00:17:09.660
But in spite of that, and along with other situations and tragedies that we face similar to Gerald's, Jehovah has seen us through them all.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:15.660
And let me say it's been a real pleasure to share Jehovah's comfort with so many.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:24.660
And as we do, we see the governing body's interest in all of Jehovah's people, including those with added responsibility.

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:30.660
They truly reflect Jehovah's feelings as the God of all comfort.

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:35.660
Well, thank you, brothers. We really appreciate your comments.

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:48.660
And more than the shepherding that you do is the example that you have set in enduring trials, experiencing Jehovah's comfort, and in comforting others.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:51.660
Thank you so much.

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:58.660
The governing body has instituted similar shepherding arrangements in branch offices around the world.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:05.579
Now, we want to talk to some of you in our audience.

00:18:05.579 --> 00:18:16.579
Because of stresses, disappointments, and hurt feelings caused by fellow believers, some have strayed from Jehovah's organization.

00:18:16.579 --> 00:18:23.579
Others may have been removed from the congregation, but now would like to return.

00:18:23.579 --> 00:18:29.579
To you, we say, allow Jehovah to comfort and strengthen you.

00:18:29.579 --> 00:18:35.579
He wants you to draw close to Him, and He will help you.

00:18:35.579 --> 00:18:38.579
James chapter 4 verse 8 says,

00:18:38.579 --> 00:18:43.579
Draw close to God, and He will draw close to you.

00:18:43.579 --> 00:18:48.859
Jehovah has great care for such ones.

00:18:48.859 --> 00:18:56.859
Let's read what he says at Ezekiel chapter 34 verse 16.

00:18:56.859 --> 00:19:06.859
The stray I will bring back, the injured I will bandage, and the weak I will strengthen.

00:19:06.859 --> 00:19:14.859
Some who have recovered have said that one of the most difficult things for them to do was across the threshold of the kingdom hall.

00:19:14.859 --> 00:19:22.859
But remember, it's Jehovah who bandages you, his sheep, helping you to heal.

00:19:22.859 --> 00:19:27.859
In the same chapter in verse 12, he says,

00:19:27.859 --> 00:19:31.859
I will care for my sheep.

00:19:31.859 --> 00:19:41.099
I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered, in imitation of that love.

00:19:41.099 --> 00:19:43.099
The faithful slave says,

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:50.099
We view you as lost sheep, not a lost cause.

00:19:50.099 --> 00:20:03.380
To all we say, no matter what you face, remember, in difficult times, Jehovah always comforts.

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:10.380
Throughout our program, we'll hear experiences of brothers and sisters who were comforted by Jehovah.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:18.380
As they share their stories, look for all the ways Jehovah helped them and consider how you can help others.

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:25.099
First is the experience of Moambi Vianne.

00:20:25.099 --> 00:20:31.099
I was born in Congo. My family died. We had to flee. There was a wall going on.

00:20:31.099 --> 00:20:39.099
One thing I remember is the bombs and the shootings that were behind us as we were running.

00:20:39.099 --> 00:20:46.099
Here people screaming too, each day we live, each step we took, we knew that something was going to happen to adults.

00:20:46.099 --> 00:20:50.099
We never knew if we were going to survive.

00:20:50.099 --> 00:20:53.099
My mom and I were the only one who survived.

00:20:53.099 --> 00:21:01.630
And that was one of the reasons we had to go to Luwanda.

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:08.630
As someone who was raising the refugee camp, I can tell you that the life in the camp was not easy.

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:13.630
The hardest part was just seeing people facing hunger.

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:20.630
And since I never had a big brother to support me, all these kids would come and beat me up, hitting me.

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:23.630
I just felt like I was a victim.

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:29.630
Even though there was all this sadness, I knew there was God out there who cares for people.

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:33.630
So what I did was I started praying to God.

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:38.630
Then I started going to the catholic church to look for Him.

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:43.630
At the age of seven, I saw these two women.

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:46.630
Because I came to run out of awareness, the job was illnesses.

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:48.630
I was so inspired by the smile.

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:51.630
And these women had the Bible in their hands.

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:55.630
And the track they gave me was about paradise.

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:58.630
Now knowing that there is a hope.

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:00.630
There is a hope for the future.

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:02.630
There is something good coming.

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:05.630
Knowing that there is a meaning of life.

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:08.630
These brought me so much joy.

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:12.630
Then I met this kid who went to his book.

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:17.630
As I opened the book, there was a scripture from Exodus, chapter 20, verse 4.

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:21.630
In that verse, it shows you must not worship any other gods.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:25.630
When I read these words, I was so shocked.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:27.630
I was so shocked.

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:30.630
And I was so disappointed of myself.

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:33.630
Because now I know that I was doing something wrong.

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:36.630
I was now worshiping the true God.

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:39.630
From there on, I left the catholic church.

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:47.630
I pray for the strength to go and look for the kingdom.

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:50.630
Then later, I went to the meeting.

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:52.630
I went to my first meeting.

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:55.630
The unity among God's people.

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:57.630
That really touched me.

00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:00.630
And then after that, everybody came and hugged me.

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:03.630
Show me this love I have never seen before.

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:10.630
And more than that, more than that, I went home knowing God's name is Jehovah.

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:12.630
This name was so special.

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:17.630
This name was just like full of strength and spirit.

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:20.630
The moment I started using Jehovah's name,

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:24.630
the moment I started praying to Jehovah.

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:27.630
He became so real to me.

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:29.630
He became my big brother.

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:32.630
He became more than a big brother.

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:39.170
Because when I prayed the first time in Jehovah's name,

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:42.170
the day that all those kids were beating me,

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:44.170
who were hitting me, now wanted to be my friend.

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:47.170
And this was the day after I went to my first meeting.

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:55.690
Really, Jehovah put a wall between my enemies.

00:23:56.690 --> 00:24:02.690
Jehovah became my rescuer in that moment.

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:07.690
And right here, I knew this is my God.

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:10.690
And I was determined to never leave him.

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:13.690
I was determined to serve him my whole life.

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:21.380
In 2011, we ended up moving from Luwanda to the U.S.

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:24.380
And I asked this lady if she knew Winesis.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.380
And she said, yes, I know Winesis.

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.380
So from then on, she called them.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.380
And I was able to reunite with my brothers and sisters.

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:35.380
In 2012, I got baptized.

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:39.380
And now I was officially one of Jehovah's Winesis,

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:41.380
one of Jehovah's people.

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.380
So right after getting baptized,

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.380
more refugees kept coming in the country.

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:48.380
I knew what these refugees went through.

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:51.380
I knew they left their lives because they lived through their life.

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:55.380
Jehovah allowed me to be able to comfort these people.

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:59.380
Being in the darkness, it was so hard.

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:02.380
But now for everything that Jehovah had done for me,

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:06.380
it just felt as if he pulled me out of this darkness.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.380
Like son, come up.

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.380
He pulled me out of this darkness.

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:12.380
To the light.

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:16.720
You come to save Jehovah.

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.720
You rely on Jehovah.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.720
You make Jehovah your salvation.

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.720
He show you who he is.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:26.579
If you're suffering some kind of trial

00:25:26.579 --> 00:25:28.579
and you're searching for God,

00:25:29.579 --> 00:25:32.579
be encouraged by my OMB story.

00:25:32.579 --> 00:25:34.579
Jehovah knows your struggles

00:25:34.579 --> 00:25:38.579
and he draws all deserving ones to him.

00:25:38.579 --> 00:25:40.579
Did you notice that my OMB,

00:25:40.579 --> 00:25:42.579
having received comfort,

00:25:42.579 --> 00:25:45.579
was moved to help others?

00:25:45.579 --> 00:25:47.579
In our next segment,

00:25:47.579 --> 00:25:49.579
we'll see just how powerful

00:25:49.579 --> 00:25:52.579
the love of our brothers and sisters can be.

00:25:52.579 --> 00:26:12.799
Likita worked for the city of Virginia Beach.

00:26:12.799 --> 00:26:14.799
With the city,

00:26:14.799 --> 00:26:16.799
she was able to get a schedule

00:26:16.799 --> 00:26:22.500
that allowed her to focus on her ministry.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:26.500
I came home on a Friday.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:30.500
But my mother and I had doctor appointments that day.

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:32.500
And we came home,

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:33.500
sat down,

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.500
gave her a Texas abit of lunch,

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.500
and I got a phone call.

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:41.500
It was a family member

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.500
asking me if I had saw the news.

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:50.500
I immediately tried to call my daughter's phone

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:53.500
and it went straight to voicemail.

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:54.500
So I said,

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.500
well, let me try a texture.

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:59.500
So I try a texture.

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.500
And I didn't get any response.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:07.309
It was about 10 to 30

00:27:07.309 --> 00:27:10.309
that night when we just finally got the confirmation

00:27:10.309 --> 00:27:13.309
that we had indeed lost her in that shooting.

00:27:13.309 --> 00:27:20.170
And I will say that's the worst day of my life.

00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:25.880
The next day,

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:30.700
starting at 7 o'clock in the morning,

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.700
friends started pouring in.

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.700
And we had people,

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:38.700
people in our home

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.700
to support us and encourage us

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.700
from morning to night.

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:54.099
And it meant so much.

00:27:54.099 --> 00:27:56.099
It helped us to

00:27:57.099 --> 00:28:02.099
focus on something else at that time.

00:28:02.099 --> 00:28:05.099
The love that they showed to us.

00:28:05.099 --> 00:28:07.099
It was just astounding.

00:28:07.099 --> 00:28:09.099
It was just so amazing.

00:28:09.099 --> 00:28:13.099
And that's what helped us to get through.

00:28:13.099 --> 00:28:15.099
To get through it all.

00:28:15.099 --> 00:28:17.099
It was our family,

00:28:17.099 --> 00:28:26.049
our spiritual family.

00:28:26.049 --> 00:28:28.049
The city of Virginia Beach,

00:28:28.049 --> 00:28:30.049
they volunteered to

00:28:30.049 --> 00:28:33.049
take care of all of the victims' arrangements.

00:28:33.049 --> 00:28:38.700
And because of that amount of people,

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:42.700
the venue that they decided upon,

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:45.700
it was the opera house in Norfolk.

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:49.700
The brothers, they got everything together.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:51.700
The city didn't really have to do anything.

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:53.700
It just gave us the venue.

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:57.700
And what really impressed them, the city,

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:01.700
was that the whole memorial,

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:05.700
everything took place within an hour.

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.700
The city officials were there in attendance.

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:11.700
You had the local newspapers who covered it,

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:13.700
reporters.

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:15.700
The reporters were persistent

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:18.700
and wanting to talk, to talk.

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:22.700
And so, actually two of my brothers,

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.700
they handled all of that information

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.700
with the guidance

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:29.700
from those two brothers who came down.

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.700
It kept us from having to even worry about that.

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:33.700
You know?

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.700
So, it was very helpful.

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.700
I continued to get cards.

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.700
I get texts from people.

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:47.049
And it just encouraged me.

00:29:47.049 --> 00:29:50.049
Isaiah 4110.

00:29:50.049 --> 00:29:54.049
It has become my favorite scripture.

00:29:54.049 --> 00:29:56.049
I will really hold on to you

00:29:56.049 --> 00:29:59.049
with my right hand of righteousness.

00:29:59.049 --> 00:30:01.049
Going through this,

00:30:01.049 --> 00:30:05.049
I could really feel Jehovah's hand.

00:30:05.049 --> 00:30:08.049
It's as if

00:30:08.049 --> 00:30:10.049
he was rubbing my shoulders

00:30:10.049 --> 00:30:12.049
and saying,

00:30:12.049 --> 00:30:14.049
it's going to be all right.

00:30:14.049 --> 00:30:15.049
You'll be all right.

00:30:15.049 --> 00:30:18.049
I'm going to get you through this.

00:30:18.049 --> 00:30:21.900
And he has,

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:24.900
each day he gets me through this.

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:26.900
If it can happen to someone else,

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:28.900
it can happen to me.

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:30.900
This is his idea.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:37.900
But that helps me to keep a perspective.

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:43.900
And I reflect on how Jehovah is going to reverse it.

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:46.900
That's my biggest hope.

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:49.900
It's to see Jehovah reverse the damage

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:51.900
that has been done.

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.900
He's promised it.

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:57.900
And my faith is in the fulfillment of his promises.

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:00.900
So I look forward to

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:06.079
being reunited with my daughter.

00:31:06.079 --> 00:31:09.079
Isaiah 432 says in part,

00:31:09.079 --> 00:31:12.079
When you pass through the waters,

00:31:12.079 --> 00:31:14.079
I will be with you.

00:31:14.079 --> 00:31:16.079
And through the rivers,

00:31:16.079 --> 00:31:19.549
they will not flood over you.

00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:21.549
Tragic and unforeseen things

00:31:21.549 --> 00:31:24.549
can befall faithful servants of Jehovah.

00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:26.549
We may suffer terribly,

00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:29.549
but we are not destroyed.

00:31:29.549 --> 00:31:32.549
We will always belong to Jehovah,

00:31:32.549 --> 00:31:35.549
the father of tender mercies.

00:31:35.549 --> 00:31:38.549
Jehovah is always there for us.

00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:41.549
But we all lead such busy lives.

00:31:41.549 --> 00:31:43.549
Our new music video vividly shows

00:31:43.549 --> 00:31:45.549
the blessings we receive

00:31:45.549 --> 00:31:48.549
when we make time for Jehovah.

00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:56.259
So much to do

00:31:56.259 --> 00:32:00.259
and so few hours in a day

00:32:00.259 --> 00:32:07.099
it's hard to steal away

00:32:07.099 --> 00:32:09.099
moments to pray,

00:32:09.099 --> 00:32:14.099
but we have got to find our way.

00:32:14.099 --> 00:32:20.779
Make time for Jehovah.

00:32:20.779 --> 00:32:26.400
Get a part of your life.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:33.859
Don't let life in this world draw you away.

00:32:33.859 --> 00:32:43.329
Time for Jehovah.

00:32:43.329 --> 00:33:00.259
Friends grow close when we share.

00:33:00.259 --> 00:33:03.259
And see that he cares.

00:33:03.259 --> 00:33:53.210
But don't let yourselves in paradise.

00:33:53.210 --> 00:36:08.429
Time to see his hands in our life.

00:36:08.429 --> 00:36:11.429
What a beautiful expression.

00:36:11.429 --> 00:36:14.429
Are you your harshest critic?

00:36:14.429 --> 00:36:17.429
We can be discouraged by our own shortcomings

00:36:17.429 --> 00:36:21.429
or failures real or imagined.

00:36:21.429 --> 00:36:23.429
Notice what can help

00:36:23.429 --> 00:36:25.429
in the latest episode of our series

00:36:25.429 --> 00:36:36.590
Apply Bible Principles.

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:38.590
When I was growing up,

00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:40.590
my parents always used to say,

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:45.769
pray about your spiritual goals.

00:36:45.769 --> 00:36:50.460
Work hard,

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:57.650
and then let Jehovah do the rest.

00:36:57.650 --> 00:37:01.730
So that's what I did.

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:07.619
And wow, did Jehovah pour out the blessing?

00:37:07.619 --> 00:37:11.619
I even got invited to a branch construction project.

00:37:11.619 --> 00:37:14.619
And I was pretty excited.

00:37:14.619 --> 00:37:19.570
At first, don't get me wrong.

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:22.570
It was a privilege to be there.

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:30.050
But the work was harder than I thought it would be.

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:34.389
There were a lot of new skills to learn.

00:37:34.389 --> 00:37:36.389
And I have to admit,

00:37:36.389 --> 00:37:41.440
I really wanted to impress my overseer.

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:46.579
So I pushed hard.

00:37:46.579 --> 00:37:52.489
Maybe a little too hard.

00:37:52.489 --> 00:37:55.489
See all that up there? That only succumbed down.

00:37:55.489 --> 00:37:58.489
Okay, do you think you can wrap this up before tomorrow?

00:37:58.489 --> 00:37:59.489
Sure thing, I'm on it.

00:37:59.489 --> 00:38:02.489
You can grab Jin and Young to give you a hand with the lift.

00:38:02.489 --> 00:38:05.489
Jin's a pro, he'll help you out.

00:38:05.489 --> 00:38:08.059
Got it.

00:38:08.059 --> 00:38:10.059
The job didn't look that hard.

00:38:10.059 --> 00:38:13.059
And I mean, I had the training.

00:38:13.059 --> 00:38:16.059
So, if I had waited for them,

00:38:16.059 --> 00:38:19.059
there was no way we were going to get this done today.

00:38:19.059 --> 00:39:00.789
The fact is, I had caused some real damage.

00:39:00.789 --> 00:39:03.789
And I made more work for everyone.

00:39:03.789 --> 00:39:07.710
Ian, are you okay?

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:09.710
Yes, I'm fine.

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:12.710
Do you have a minute to talk in my office?

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:21.400
I felt like such a loser.

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:31.019
The brothers talked to me,

00:39:31.019 --> 00:39:33.019
and they were nice about it.

00:39:33.019 --> 00:39:35.019
But I was still left thinking,

00:39:35.019 --> 00:39:37.019
what am I doing here?

00:39:37.019 --> 00:39:40.019
Maybe I should just go home.

00:39:40.019 --> 00:39:43.019
James 3-2 says,

00:39:43.019 --> 00:39:46.019
four real stumble many times.

00:39:46.019 --> 00:39:49.019
But the real question is,

00:39:49.019 --> 00:39:51.019
when you stumble,

00:39:51.019 --> 00:39:53.019
and it is going to happen,

00:39:53.019 --> 00:39:57.380
what should we do then?

00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:00.820
Yes, Jake.

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:03.820
When dad was teaching me to ride my bike,

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:05.820
I felt a lot.

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.820
And it was hard,

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:10.820
but I just kept getting up and trying again.

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:14.820
And now, I can ride pretty fast.

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:17.820
So you just have to get back up when you fall.

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:19.820
Yes, that's right.

00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:21.820
That was a great comment.

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:24.820
Wow, Jake, that's it.

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:26.820
I had to swallow my pride,

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:28.820
and just get back up.

00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:37.030
I realized I needed to be more focused

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:40.030
on the seriousness of my assignment,

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:42.030
and not so focused on myself.

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:47.429
And instead of trying to do everything myself,

00:40:47.429 --> 00:40:50.429
I set more realistic expectations

00:40:50.429 --> 00:40:52.429
about what I could do,

00:40:52.429 --> 00:40:57.280
and what I couldn't.

00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.280
I had a lot to learn.

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:02.280
So I kept working and learning.

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:06.420
And after a while,

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:12.989
I even got to help train some of the new volunteers.

00:41:12.989 --> 00:41:15.989
In the end, I was so thankful to Jehovah

00:41:15.989 --> 00:41:19.989
for helping me understand that in the race for life,

00:41:19.989 --> 00:41:22.989
none of us are going to cross the finish line

00:41:22.989 --> 00:41:24.989
without stumbling.

00:41:24.989 --> 00:41:27.989
The important thing is to get back up

00:41:27.989 --> 00:41:33.099
and just keep going.

00:41:33.099 --> 00:41:35.099
Some hesitate to draw close to people

00:41:35.099 --> 00:41:38.099
of different races or nationalities.

00:41:38.099 --> 00:41:39.099
But they can overcome this

00:41:39.099 --> 00:41:42.099
by imitating Jehovah's impartiality.

00:41:42.099 --> 00:41:43.099
The result?

00:41:43.099 --> 00:41:45.099
Great joy.

00:41:45.099 --> 00:41:47.099
We'll see an example of this

00:41:47.099 --> 00:41:54.409
in the following report.

00:41:54.409 --> 00:41:58.409
On September 18, 2020,

00:41:58.409 --> 00:41:59.409
Medicaine Janos,

00:41:59.409 --> 00:42:01.409
a rare Mediterranean cyclone,

00:42:01.409 --> 00:42:03.409
struck Greece and flooded

00:42:03.409 --> 00:42:05.409
a Roma settlement in America

00:42:05.409 --> 00:42:10.900
just outside the city of Cardezza.

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:12.900
Local authorities worked alongside

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.900
emergency services to evacuate

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:16.900
over 1,000 Roma who lived there.

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:18.900
But a family of seven

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:20.900
who are studying with Jehovah's Witnesses

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:21.900
were left behind.

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:26.019
It was raining hard,

00:42:26.019 --> 00:42:28.019
and the floodwaters were rising quickly.

00:42:28.019 --> 00:42:30.019
I took my wife by the hand

00:42:30.019 --> 00:42:32.019
and carried my child on my back.

00:42:32.019 --> 00:42:34.019
With great difficulty,

00:42:34.019 --> 00:42:36.019
we managed to make it to a neighboring house.

00:42:36.019 --> 00:42:39.019
We were unable to contact the authorities.

00:42:39.019 --> 00:42:42.019
We were terrified and had no option

00:42:42.019 --> 00:42:44.019
to stay there.

00:42:44.019 --> 00:42:46.019
We didn't know what to do.

00:42:46.019 --> 00:42:48.019
We were so scared and worried.

00:42:48.019 --> 00:42:50.019
We had never experienced anything

00:42:50.019 --> 00:42:52.019
like this before.

00:42:52.019 --> 00:42:54.019
The floodwaters had risen a lot

00:42:54.019 --> 00:42:56.019
and we stood waiting for hours.

00:42:56.019 --> 00:42:59.019
I asked my father to pray for us.

00:42:59.019 --> 00:43:01.019
He did.

00:43:01.019 --> 00:43:03.019
Many times.

00:43:03.019 --> 00:43:05.019
There were lots of people in the house,

00:43:05.019 --> 00:43:07.019
both young and old.

00:43:07.019 --> 00:43:14.710
They were afraid and they were crying.

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:16.710
Video messages from the family

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:19.710
started to come through asking for help.

00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:21.710
We could see their fear.

00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:23.710
We wanted to help them,

00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:25.710
but there was no way for us to go there

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:28.710
because access was impossible.

00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:31.710
All we could do was pray to Jehovah for them

00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:34.710
and send messages of encouragement.

00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:37.710
We were very distressed.

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:39.710
Children were crying.

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:42.710
I prayed to Jehovah begging him for peace at mind.

00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:44.710
I threw all my burdens

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:47.710
and anxiety at my heart on Jehovah.

00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:51.710
Soon I felt calm and had no anxiety.

00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:53.710
I felt his spirit giving me strength

00:43:53.710 --> 00:44:12.650
during the hours that followed until dawn.

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:14.650
The situation was very difficult.

00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:16.650
They had suffered a lot

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:18.650
and their clothes were dirty.

00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:23.309
There was no way that I could leave them there.

00:44:23.309 --> 00:44:26.309
We were given a house to staying.

00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:30.309
We were able to calm down and sleep.

00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:32.309
The brothers gave us food.

00:44:32.309 --> 00:44:37.309
I thanked Jehovah for teaching us and taking care of us.

00:44:37.309 --> 00:44:40.909
He is our savior.

00:44:40.909 --> 00:44:43.909
When I attended the first meeting after the flood,

00:44:43.909 --> 00:44:45.909
I felt calm again.

00:44:45.909 --> 00:44:48.909
I tried to keep my routine as normal.

00:44:48.909 --> 00:44:53.909
Study, meetings, preparing comments.

00:44:53.909 --> 00:44:56.909
I felt joy and contentment.

00:44:56.909 --> 00:44:58.909
My legal documents such as my ID

00:44:58.909 --> 00:45:00.909
were saved from the flood.

00:45:00.909 --> 00:45:02.909
Our neighbours were not prepared.

00:45:02.909 --> 00:45:05.909
But we, thanks to Jehovah's direction,

00:45:05.909 --> 00:45:08.909
had packed emergency bags.

00:45:08.909 --> 00:45:10.909
About a week later,

00:45:10.909 --> 00:45:12.909
we were able to return to America.

00:45:12.909 --> 00:45:17.909
The houses were in a terrible condition, full of mud.

00:45:17.909 --> 00:45:21.909
The disaster relief committee helped us immediately.

00:45:21.909 --> 00:45:26.909
Brothers from 300 kilometres away sent emergency supplies.

00:45:27.909 --> 00:45:30.909
The brotherhood showed us love in practice.

00:45:30.909 --> 00:45:34.909
They worked hard and helped us because they loved us.

00:45:34.909 --> 00:45:37.909
I was deeply touched and found myself in awe.

00:45:37.909 --> 00:45:38.909
We are united.

00:45:38.909 --> 00:45:44.909
All of this brought glory and praise to Jehovah.

00:45:44.909 --> 00:45:46.909
When we went there to help,

00:45:46.909 --> 00:45:48.909
the Roman neighbours were very surprised.

00:45:48.909 --> 00:45:50.909
They asked if we could help them too.

00:45:50.909 --> 00:45:54.909
We replied that we have to help our family first.

00:45:55.909 --> 00:45:59.909
They were very puzzled that we called our Roma brothers family

00:45:59.909 --> 00:46:04.250
since we were not from their tribe.

00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:08.250
Ephesians 4.16 finds a good application in this story.

00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:13.250
Just as every joint in the body offers help.

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:16.250
So did the brothers.

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:23.300
We all worked together to provide help to our brothers in need.

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:26.300
Jehovah's teaching me and helping me.

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:28.300
I really trust in him.

00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:30.300
He has blessed me personally.

00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:33.300
I have seen how good he is to me.

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:35.300
In a miserable world,

00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:37.300
Jehovah brings me joy.

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:41.300
I know that he chooses according to a person's heart.

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:48.869
All glory belongs to Jehovah.

00:46:48.869 --> 00:46:53.869
In total, seven members of the Securus family are studying the Bible.

00:46:53.869 --> 00:46:58.869
Five who are deaf are studying with a Greek sign language group.

00:46:58.869 --> 00:47:02.869
When the flood struck, about 20 people,

00:47:02.869 --> 00:47:04.869
including the Securus family,

00:47:04.869 --> 00:47:07.869
could not be evacuated due to strong currents.

00:47:07.869 --> 00:47:11.869
At first, other Roma, who had been left behind,

00:47:11.869 --> 00:47:16.869
blamed the flood on the family because they were all studying with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:47:16.869 --> 00:47:21.869
But after they observed the assistance provided by the brothers and sisters,

00:47:21.869 --> 00:47:22.869
they said,

00:47:22.869 --> 00:47:24.869
You have the true religion.

00:47:24.869 --> 00:47:26.869
You show genuine love.

00:47:26.869 --> 00:47:31.730
Our series, My Teen Life,

00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:36.730
has helped many young witnesses navigate today's realities.

00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:41.730
Our next episode has to do with association.

00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:45.730
And we'll hear from a brother and a sister who eventually made good decisions

00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:48.730
with the help of Bible principles.

00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:50.730
That may not surprise you.

00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:55.730
But what we're looking for in this is how.

00:47:55.730 --> 00:48:00.730
How did they go from knowing Bible principles to applying them?

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:14.440
My parents were both Jehovah's Witnesses by the time I was born.

00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:17.440
So I studied the Bible, attended meetings,

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:20.440
and went out and surfaced with them.

00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:22.440
Growing up in the truth,

00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:26.440
I knew that living by Bible standards is what's best for me.

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:30.440
And my parents were always so zealous when it came to spiritual things.

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:32.440
So when I think back,

00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:36.940
I just didn't want to let them down.

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:40.940
Following Bible principles is not burdensome or even that difficult.

00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:43.940
Honestly, if we do as it says in the Bible,

00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:46.940
then we benefit ourselves.

00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:52.940
But at times, I was curious how my life would be if I wasn't in the truth.

00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:56.940
It was just so fun to be around my school friends.

00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:59.940
Overall, I had a good time at school.

00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:03.940
I got along with my classmates and my teachers like me too.

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:06.940
So being in school was a pretty good experience.

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:11.940
My parents always told me not to get too close to my classmates.

00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:16.940
But in my opinion, my friends had good conduct and were good people.

00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:19.940
I didn't understand why they were so worried.

00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:21.940
In my high school,

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:24.940
there were a lot of kids who went to church

00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:27.940
and many of the teachers had religious backgrounds.

00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:31.940
One day, there was an incident when the entire school found out

00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:33.940
I was one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:37.940
I knew that some people might be prejudiced against witnesses,

00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:41.940
but I was surprised to see how everyone could change so suddenly.

00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:44.940
I started spending more time with my classmates.

00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:46.940
But the more I hung out with them,

00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:49.940
the more I saw that we were living completely different lives.

00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:53.940
Their conversations would be about trips they went on over the weekend

00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:56.940
and what they bought on their latest shopping trip.

00:49:56.940 --> 00:50:00.940
But when it came to me, all I had done was spiritual activities.

00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:03.940
It felt like I was missing out.

00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:06.940
I felt alone and like an outcast.

00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:11.940
I knew in my head that Bible principles are right and beneficial.

00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:14.940
But when I was actually put in that situation,

00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:18.260
I wasn't so sure anymore.

00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:22.260
I started to feel like I wasn't as cool as my classmates.

00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:25.260
So when they started to talk about their life goals,

00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:29.260
I couldn't bring myself to tell them what my goals were.

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:31.260
So I started thinking,

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:34.260
what would be the right way for me to act?

00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:38.260
Opening up to my parents about my situation really helped.

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:40.260
One day for family worship,

00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:43.260
we decided to discuss that topic.

00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:46.260
We read Matthew chapter 5 verse 11.

00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:50.260
Happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you

00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:55.260
and blindly say every sort of wicked thing against you for my sake.

00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:58.260
But how can you be happy when persecuted?

00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:00.260
I thought to myself,

00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:02.260
but I'm not happy right now.

00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:05.260
My mom shared Mark 838 with me.

00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:07.260
The part in the scripture where it says that,

00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:09.260
if we are ashamed of Jesus Christ,

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:11.260
He will be ashamed of us.

00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:13.260
Really hit me.

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:15.260
I realized that deep inside,

00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:18.260
I had been ashamed of being a witness.

00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:20.260
While I was going through all of this,

00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:23.260
a brother gave a public talk in a congregation

00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:26.260
and read Matthew chapter 19 verse 29.

00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:27.260
There it says,

00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:30.260
that everyone who has left what is important to them

00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:35.260
for the sake of Jehovah will receive a hundred times as much.

00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:39.260
So I decided to try living what I thought was important to me

00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:42.260
and see what results and blessings I might receive.

00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:44.260
About that time,

00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:47.260
my parents helped me to associate with brothers and sisters

00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:51.260
who were participating in many different forms of full-time service

00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:54.260
so that I could hear their experiences.

00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:59.260
That helped me to decide which direction I wanted to go in my life.

00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:02.260
One thing that was really great about this decision

00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:06.260
was that I was able to meet many new brothers and sisters.

00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:08.260
I realized that there were so many people

00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:11.260
who had the same thoughts and goals as I did.

00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:14.260
These were my true friends.

00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:18.260
The next time the topic of our future goals came up with my classmates,

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:20.260
I was able to speak up confidently.

00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:25.260
I am really thankful to my parents who helped me to find the courage to do that.

00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:29.260
I felt that Jehovah truly keeps his promises.

00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:31.260
Come to think of it,

00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:35.260
Jehovah has kept his promise to reward me a hundred times as much

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:39.260
if I choose to live by the Bible's principles.

00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:43.500
I am really happy now

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:47.500
when I am confident that if I follow the Bible's teachings when I make decisions,

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:51.500
I will always have the best results.

00:52:51.500 --> 00:53:06.699
They were familiar with the Bible,

00:53:06.699 --> 00:53:09.699
but its value became real to them

00:53:09.699 --> 00:53:13.699
when they put Bible principles into practice.

00:53:13.699 --> 00:53:19.650
This month's program underscored that in difficult times,

00:53:19.650 --> 00:53:23.650
Jehovah always comforts.

00:53:23.650 --> 00:53:27.650
Servants of Jehovah like Sister Brown and her daughter

00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:30.650
may suffer terrible blows,

00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:32.650
but no matter what happens to us,

00:53:32.650 --> 00:53:34.650
even if we die,

00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:37.650
we always belong to Jehovah.

00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:40.650
Bible truths were a comfort to my own bee

00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:43.650
who never gave up searching for God.

00:53:43.650 --> 00:53:45.650
And finally,

00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:50.650
all of us provide comfort when we show impartial love.

00:53:50.650 --> 00:53:54.960
Now it's time for our video postcard.

00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:58.960
This month we visit our brothers in Alaska.

00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:05.099
Alaska is in the far northwest corner of North America.

00:54:05.099 --> 00:54:08.099
One-third of it lies within the Arctic Circle,

00:54:08.099 --> 00:54:11.099
and some areas temperatures can drop

00:54:11.099 --> 00:54:14.099
below negative 60 degrees Fahrenheit

00:54:14.099 --> 00:54:17.099
or negative 54 degrees Celsius.

00:54:17.099 --> 00:54:21.099
This is a sparsely populated land of glaciers,

00:54:21.099 --> 00:54:23.099
permafrost and tundra,

00:54:23.099 --> 00:54:26.099
and is rich habitat for bears,

00:54:26.099 --> 00:54:28.099
caribou, moose, whales,

00:54:28.099 --> 00:54:31.099
and dozens of species of fish.

00:54:31.099 --> 00:54:35.099
Let's visit the Costco Quinn congregation in Bethel, Alaska.

00:54:35.099 --> 00:54:38.099
That's right, the village is named Bethel.

00:54:38.099 --> 00:54:41.099
22 publishers preach in a territory

00:54:41.099 --> 00:54:45.099
that includes 13 villages connected by waterways.

00:54:45.099 --> 00:54:48.099
As the weather and seasons change,

00:54:48.099 --> 00:54:50.099
so does their choice of transportation.

00:54:50.099 --> 00:54:53.099
Four wheelers and snowmobiles are common,

00:54:53.099 --> 00:54:57.099
since many villages lack roads and cars.

00:54:57.099 --> 00:55:01.099
This road is actually on top of a frozen river.

00:55:01.099 --> 00:55:03.099
Here's a caravan of publishers

00:55:03.099 --> 00:55:06.099
on their way to the village of Cuithlook.

00:55:06.099 --> 00:55:07.099
To be safe,

00:55:07.099 --> 00:55:10.099
brothers travel with two or more vehicles

00:55:10.099 --> 00:55:13.099
in case one gets stuck or breaks down.

00:55:13.099 --> 00:55:16.099
Daily sunlight varies with the seasons

00:55:16.099 --> 00:55:19.099
from less than six hours during winter

00:55:19.099 --> 00:55:22.099
to more than 19 during summer.

00:55:22.099 --> 00:55:25.099
The congregation includes nine regular

00:55:25.099 --> 00:55:28.099
and five special pioneers.

00:55:28.099 --> 00:55:33.099
An average of 85 Bible studies are conducted every month.

00:55:33.099 --> 00:55:35.099
In addition to an English congregation,

00:55:35.099 --> 00:55:38.099
there is a UPIC pregroup.

00:55:38.099 --> 00:55:41.099
Dog sledding is an important part of UPIC culture.

00:55:41.099 --> 00:55:45.099
Several races are held here every year.

00:55:45.099 --> 00:55:48.099
This Bible student is wearing a traditional garment

00:55:48.099 --> 00:55:50.099
called a cuspuck.

00:55:50.099 --> 00:55:53.099
Many in the meetings give their comments in UPIC

00:55:53.099 --> 00:55:56.099
and have them translated into English.

00:55:56.099 --> 00:55:59.099
Although most publishers aren't fluent in UPIC,

00:55:59.099 --> 00:56:02.099
they use publications and videos translated into UPIC

00:56:02.099 --> 00:56:04.099
in the ministry.

00:56:04.099 --> 00:56:07.099
Baptisms are normally held at conventions and assemblies

00:56:07.099 --> 00:56:09.099
in the city of Anchorage.

00:56:09.099 --> 00:56:12.099
But this Bible student made her dedication to Jehovah

00:56:12.099 --> 00:56:15.099
during the COVID-19 pandemic.

00:56:15.099 --> 00:56:17.099
Despite the frigid weather,

00:56:17.099 --> 00:56:20.099
she was baptized in this river.

00:56:20.099 --> 00:56:22.099
This is where she grew up.

00:56:22.099 --> 00:56:25.099
Our brothers and sisters from the Costco quim congregation

00:56:25.099 --> 00:56:28.099
in Bethel, Alaska send their love and greetings

00:56:28.099 --> 00:56:30.099
to the worldwide brotherhood.

00:56:30.099 --> 00:56:34.349
From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:56:34.349 --> 00:56:37.349
this is J.W. Broadcasting.
