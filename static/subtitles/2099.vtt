00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:22.129
Over the past several years, Russian authorities have misused the law on counteracting extremist activity to restrict the peaceful worship of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:22.129 --> 00:00:29.129
Nowhere is this more evident than in the trial of 16 of Jehovah's Witnesses in Tagunrog, Russia.

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:39.130
Since 2011, authorities have subjected these witnesses to criminal prosecution merely for practicing their faith.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:50.130
The prosecutor is demanding that the court sentenced four congregation elders to six years in prison for organizing religious meetings.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:57.130
16 members of the congregation are facing heavy fines for attending those meetings.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.130
The judge is expected to issue a verdict by as early as the end of October.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:11.129
The prosecutor has accused the members of this congregation of extremist activity, of inciting hatred.

00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:14.129
But what are the facts?

00:01:14.129 --> 00:01:21.129
The witnesses were not accused of encouraging acts of violence or spewing hate speech.

00:01:21.129 --> 00:01:32.129
These witnesses are on trial for meeting together to discuss the Bible, for holding the same religious services that Jehovah's Witnesses around the world hold every week.

00:01:32.129 --> 00:01:35.129
They are not extremists.

00:01:35.129 --> 00:01:44.129
The criminal case against Jehovah's Witnesses in Tagunrog is part of a growing pattern of religious opposition in Russia.

00:01:44.129 --> 00:01:56.129
Courts have ruled to confiscate the witnesses' places of worship in Tagunrog, Samara, and Abinsk, and to liquidate their legal entities in these regions.

00:01:56.129 --> 00:02:00.129
Other similar cases are pending.

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:09.129
Customs authorities have blocked all religious literature published by Jehovah's Witnesses, including Bibles, from entering the country.

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:17.129
Russia is the only country in the world to ban JW.org, the Witnesses' official international website.

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:23.129
Russia is now at a crossroads regarding freedom of religion.

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:30.129
Will Russia now imprison its own citizens merely for peacefully practicing their faith?

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:47.129
The Council of Europe and the United Nations Human Rights Committee have called on Russia to stop misapplying the law and extremism to peaceful religious communities and specifically mentioned Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:47.129 --> 00:03:04.129
Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia want to abide by the Bibles command at 1 Timothy 2, 1 and 2, so that they can lead a calm and quiet life with complete godly devotion as they have been endeavouring to do.

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:13.129
Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide asked the Tagunrog Court to exonerate these witnesses of all charges.

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:28.129
We urge Russia to abide by its international agreements, uphold justice, preserve the rule of law, and protect the freedoms its espouses in its constitution.
