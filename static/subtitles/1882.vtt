00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:10.300
This global pandemic has thrown the world into a state of uncertainty with so many unknowns.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.300
But there's one thing that we do know.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:19.300
Through it all, Jehovah has really been taking care of us.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:30.300
Day after day, brothers around the world tell us that they truly feel that Jehovah and his organization are watching over them.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.299
It makes me think of the Scripture at Isaiah chapter 40 and verse 11.

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:41.299
Like a shepherd, he will care for his flock.

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:49.299
With his arm, he will gather together the lambs, and in his bosom he will carry them.

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:54.299
He will gently lead those nursing their young.

00:00:55.299 --> 00:01:03.299
Is that how you feel? Like a lamb in the protective arms of our Heavenly Father?

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:09.299
Well, we as members of the governing body feel exactly the same way.

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:19.299
All of us are getting through this challenging time thanks to the tender and loving care of our Heavenly Father.

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:26.299
As that tender shepherd, Jehovah does more than just take note of our problems.

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.299
He looks for ways to help us.

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.299
As Psalm 37 5 says,

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:42.299
commit your way to Jehovah, rely on him and he will act in your behalf.

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:51.299
One way that Jehovah acts in our behalf is by motivating his people to help those in need.

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:59.299
In this report, we'd like to share some examples of how our brothers and sisters are doing just that.

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:09.300
In some parts of the world, one of the foremost concerns our brothers have is simply getting enough to eat.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:22.300
Extremely limited food supplies, lockdowns, widespread unemployment, and other problems have left families with little or no food.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:32.300
The Coordinators Committee of the governing body has been doing all it can to help provide food and basic medicine to those brothers.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:39.300
More than 400 disaster relief committees have already been appointed worldwide.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:48.300
These committees are working tirelessly to ensure that our brothers and sisters have what they need to survive.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.300
That's the case in the country of Angola.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.300
How are the brothers benefiting from the food relief being provided?

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.300
Brother Johannes DiYager from the Angola branch has an update for us.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.280
Back in March, a state of emergency was declared here in Angola.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.280
With the lockdown, many of our brothers and sisters could no longer work, making it difficult to feed their families.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.280
As a branch committee, we were extremely concerned about the situation.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.280
We wondered, how are we going to look after all our dear brothers and sisters?

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.280
We immediately wrote Coordinators Committee and informed them of the situation.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:40.280
Here can imagine how we were overjoyed when they replied, providing us the aid so that we could feed our dear brothers.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.280
Well, suddenly we needed to coordinate a huge relief effort.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.280
To accomplish the work, we appointed 37 disaster relief committees.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:59.280
Luckily, we purchased and distributed 138 tonnes of rice, 138 tonnes of maize mill and 104 tonnes of beans.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.280
Additionally, through World Headquarters, we purchased 313 tonnes of food from Brazil.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.280
The first shipment arrived July 12th.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.280
Our brothers have worked quickly to distribute the food.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:21.279
Thus far, 34,701 brothers and interested ones have received basic food supplies.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:25.279
The appreciation for these provisions has been overwhelming.

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:32.279
For example, one widowed sister raising her five grandchildren received food.

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:37.279
She said, Jehovah, seize me.

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:49.279
We realize that this is an ongoing situation, but we are confident that Jehovah will continue to lovingly care for all our brothers in Angola.

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:57.819
What a clear expression of Jehovah's tender care for our brothers in Angola.

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:01.819
Of course, the need for relief isn't limited to Angola.

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:12.819
Right now, with Jehovah's help, relief efforts are ongoing throughout Africa, South America, and many other parts of the world.

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:25.819
In fact, the governing body has thus far approved over $17 million of relief aid to help our dear brothers during this pandemic.

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:31.819
Now, on this topic of food supplies, we'd like to share a reminder.

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:39.819
With ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks occurring, and in some cases reoccurring around the world,

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:50.819
we never know when supply lines will falter in our area, or when we may need to shelter in place for an extended period of time.

00:05:51.819 --> 00:06:06.819
So, if possible, in your local situation, it would be wise to have on hand a reserve of non-perishable food items and other basic necessities,

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:17.819
not hoarding food or stockpiling it unnecessarily, but maintaining a reasonable supply as a precaution.

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:24.819
But now, what about our spiritual food? How is Jehovah caring for that need?

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:30.819
Many of us have been attending our congregation meetings by video conference.

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:37.819
Although we miss the personal contact, haven't our online meetings been a blessing?

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:42.819
In many places, meeting attendants has gone up significantly.

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:49.819
Many of our dear inactive brothers and sisters have been attending with us.

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:52.819
It's been wonderful to have them.

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:57.819
And how proud we are of you elderly brothers and sisters.

00:06:57.819 --> 00:07:02.819
You've quickly learned how to use the video conferencing tools.

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:07.819
We love seeing you participate at the meetings.

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:19.819
But as we know, many of our brothers and sisters live in areas where internet access is either not available or it's simply too expensive.

00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:24.819
How are our brothers in these areas getting their spiritual food?

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:33.819
You may recall from the third governing body update that some branches in Africa were approved to broadcast the special talk

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:39.819
and the memorial over local TV and radio stations.

00:07:39.819 --> 00:07:51.819
Well, I'm so happy to tell you that the governing body has also approved to have regular congregation meetings broadcast via TV and radio.

00:07:51.819 --> 00:07:57.819
One of the branches benefiting from this arrangement is Mozambique.

00:07:57.819 --> 00:08:03.819
Brother Amaro Teixeira will give us an update on the impact that this is having.

00:08:03.819 --> 00:08:13.319
In Mozambique, many brothers live in areas where internet and electronic devices are not available.

00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:24.319
So we are so happy when the governing body informed all branches in Africa that we could investigate broadcast and congregation meetings of a TV and radio.

00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:33.320
As of July 10, arrangements have been made with 87 radios and 1 TV outlet in Mozambique.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:43.320
This allows more than 51,000 of our brothers and sisters to listen to the meetings each week in 24 different languages.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.320
That is very good for our brothers.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:54.320
These special programs are in the same time available to an audience of about 23 million people.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.320
Our brothers are so grateful for these arrangements.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:03.320
When it was announced, some cried tears of joy.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.320
Many brothers share the feelings of one couple who wrote.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:18.320
Your hard work together with Jehovah's Holy Spirit has moved the mountains to give our brothers in Mozambique their spiritual food at the proper time.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:32.019
Jehovah's active support and love for all of us overwhelmed us with gratitude and love for him, his son and our spiritual family.

00:09:32.019 --> 00:09:34.019
How wonderful.

00:09:34.019 --> 00:09:46.019
This provision was recently extended to other branches and now we're broadcasting congregation meetings via TV and radio in 21 countries.

00:09:46.019 --> 00:10:01.019
This allows about 1.2 million brothers and sisters to listen to recordings of congregation meetings and makes our spiritual programs available to a potential audience of almost two hundred.

00:10:01.019 --> 00:10:06.019
Almost two hundred and eighty million people.

00:10:06.019 --> 00:10:14.019
Jehovah is certainly providing his people with needed physical and spiritual food.

00:10:14.019 --> 00:10:19.019
But how is he caring for our persecuted brothers?

00:10:19.019 --> 00:10:26.019
During this pandemic, many of us may have felt like prisoners in our own homes.

00:10:26.019 --> 00:10:35.019
But just think for a moment about those who are actually in prison right now during this pandemic.

00:10:35.019 --> 00:10:45.019
As of July 19, at least one hundred and sixteen brothers and sisters worldwide are imprisoned for their faith.

00:10:46.019 --> 00:10:58.019
In Russia, an additional 27 are presently under house arrest and 372 are under criminal investigation.

00:10:58.019 --> 00:11:08.019
Worldwide, the youngest ones in prison are just nineteen years old and the oldest is 81.

00:11:08.019 --> 00:11:13.019
Some of our brothers have been imprisoned or under house arrest for years.

00:11:13.019 --> 00:11:26.019
Take for example our three brothers in Eritrea, Paoloz, Isaac and Negede, who have been imprisoned the longest almost twenty-six years.

00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:40.019
In Russia, just last week, on July 13, 2020, there was a record number of searches of our brothers' homes, at least one hundred in one day.

00:11:40.019 --> 00:11:50.019
In connection with this raid, brothers Dmitri Katerov and Alexander Bolkov were beaten by the authorities.

00:11:51.019 --> 00:12:02.019
Counting from the time when the ban started in 2017, this brings the total number of home raids to over one thousand.

00:12:02.019 --> 00:12:13.019
Our brothers in prison around the world needed our prayers before COVID-19 and they need them even more now.

00:12:13.019 --> 00:12:17.019
At Hebrews 13-3, Paul wrote,

00:12:17.019 --> 00:12:24.019
Keep in mind those in prison as though you were imprisoned with them.

00:12:24.019 --> 00:12:31.019
Certainly, we feel for our brothers and sisters who are imprisoned for their faith.

00:12:31.019 --> 00:12:33.019
How are they bearing up?

00:12:33.019 --> 00:12:37.019
How is Jehovah sustaining them through their trials?

00:12:37.019 --> 00:12:42.019
Let's get an update from two sisters who were held in detention in Russia.

00:12:47.909 --> 00:12:57.909
On June 11, 2019, at around eight in the morning, offices from their investigative committee and the police burst into our home.

00:12:57.909 --> 00:13:00.909
The search lasted almost all day.

00:13:00.909 --> 00:13:08.909
And then after the search, they took us to the investigative committee, where they detained us and put us in a temporarily holding facility.

00:13:08.909 --> 00:13:11.909
The result was a court hearing in Nizipkov.

00:13:11.909 --> 00:13:15.909
They imposed restrictive measures on me, meaning they put me in detention.

00:13:15.909 --> 00:13:19.909
And all together, I spent almost eight months behind bars.

00:13:19.909 --> 00:13:26.909
I spent eight months in a pre-trial detention facility. I spent 245 days behind bars.

00:13:26.909 --> 00:13:35.759
For me, the time I spent in pre-trial detention went by very quickly.

00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:44.759
Even that number, 245 days, it sounds like a lot, but really, it didn't feel like that many.

00:13:44.759 --> 00:13:50.759
Because I was busy replying to letters, also talking to my cellmates.

00:13:50.759 --> 00:13:59.759
I prayed to Jehovah a lot during that time, read the Bible, and I did personal study.

00:13:59.759 --> 00:14:07.759
Eight months in pre-trial detention, you could really describe as being in isolation, because I missed life association.

00:14:07.759 --> 00:14:14.759
Life association with brothers and sisters, when you can talk to them in real life, face to face and even hug them.

00:14:14.759 --> 00:14:24.759
In the beginning, it was hard, but then I saw that if you accept the circumstances, it becomes easier to get on with life.

00:14:24.759 --> 00:14:34.759
I prayed to Jehovah not to feel sorry for myself, and not to concentrate on how bad things were, being in one room all the time.

00:14:35.759 --> 00:14:41.759
I prayed to accept the conditions I found myself in on any given day.

00:14:41.759 --> 00:14:47.759
I also realized that it is important to always look for reasons to be grateful.

00:14:47.759 --> 00:14:55.759
And every evening, even if it didn't seem as though anything particularly special had happened, I tried to thank Jehovah,

00:14:55.759 --> 00:15:00.759
and that also gave me strength, because it turns out that in every day there is something good.

00:15:01.759 --> 00:15:06.759
It got to the point where sometimes I didn't even notice the locked door.

00:15:06.759 --> 00:15:10.759
Through the bars, I saw the sky and didn't even see the bars.

00:15:10.759 --> 00:15:19.759
Or when we went out for exercise, which was just a yard with walls all around, and just a bit of the sky is visible.

00:15:19.759 --> 00:15:27.759
I realized that Jehovah gives the right attitude when, for example, I wondered, what is behind those walls?

00:15:27.759 --> 00:15:36.759
And I could even imagine that the Alps were out there, that they were corn flowers, my favorite flowers out there, and poppies.

00:15:36.759 --> 00:15:50.759
I think Jehovah that I had, for example, the Bible, and that I could read it, and for being able to pray to Jehovah, for the fact that I had been able to do the right thing that day, for the bird that I had seen from the window.

00:15:50.759 --> 00:15:57.759
And before the detention, I imagined that if it did happen, it is an assignment from Jehovah for the time being.

00:15:57.759 --> 00:16:02.759
The first day I received letters was the anniversary of my baptism.

00:16:02.759 --> 00:16:06.759
Twenty-four years had passed since that occasion.

00:16:06.759 --> 00:16:15.759
I was feeling somewhat downcast, and I asked Jehovah for a special gift, and at the end of the day, I received that special gift.

00:16:15.759 --> 00:16:26.759
It was fifty-nine letters from brothers and sisters, and I realized just what a unique God Jehovah is, and that he tenderly cares for his servants.

00:16:26.759 --> 00:16:30.759
It convinced me once again that Jehovah is a caring father.

00:16:30.759 --> 00:16:40.759
The first time I received such a large number of letters, fifty-four of them, I sat on the bed, put them on my lap, and didn't know what to do with them.

00:16:40.759 --> 00:16:47.759
I gathered my thoughts. Of course, there were tears in my eyes, so I gathered my thoughts and started going through them.

00:16:47.759 --> 00:16:52.759
Thanks to the letters, I was also able to do personal study.

00:16:52.759 --> 00:16:58.759
I wrote down in two exercise books that thoughts that really strengthened me.

00:16:58.759 --> 00:17:05.759
In one letter, it talked about the secret of David's courage, and it said that he concentrated,

00:17:05.759 --> 00:17:13.759
not on how big Galaeus was in comparison to him, but on how tiny the giant was in comparison to Jehovah.

00:17:13.759 --> 00:17:20.759
That thought really helped me to switch to the right frame of mind and see Jehovah.

00:17:20.759 --> 00:17:35.539
And when they escorted me from the courtroom to the vehicle, to the transport vehicle, the brothers and sisters were still there, shouted words of encouragement.

00:17:36.539 --> 00:17:45.009
Of course, I didn't expect to see them there, because I didn't know how they would escort us from the courtroom.

00:17:45.009 --> 00:17:55.009
Although, you could say I was rather sad, because they left in place the restrictive measures, but when I got into the vehicle, I was overjoyed inside,

00:17:55.009 --> 00:18:00.009
because though I could hardly see the brothers, I could hear their voices.

00:18:05.579 --> 00:18:14.579
It made me determined to remain faithful to Jehovah, and it helped me to stand up for the truth in the court hearings,

00:18:14.579 --> 00:18:22.579
and I felt that I was not alone, because I knew that many are concerned for me and praying for me.

00:18:22.579 --> 00:18:29.579
When I was in hard circumstances, I actually became convinced that no matter how serious the difficulties are,

00:18:29.579 --> 00:18:35.579
Jehovah always gives enough Holy Spirit to overcome any trial.

00:18:35.579 --> 00:18:41.579
I realized that actually there is no need to be afraid of trials that may befall us.

00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:49.579
Jehovah is always close to us, and he always supports, strengthens and helps us.

00:18:49.579 --> 00:18:57.579
He is very sensitive to our needs, and at times like that, he draws close to us in a unique way.

00:18:57.579 --> 00:19:12.180
How encouraging. Prison walls cannot stop Jehovah from tenderly caring for his servants.

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:22.180
I think these building expressions of our sisters will help many of us who are feeling isolated because of the pandemic.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:28.180
Brothers and sisters, we're all going through a difficult time.

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:40.180
Some of you have lost your jobs, some are concerned about finding enough food for each day, and many of us have lost loved ones in death.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:52.180
In spite of all these challenges, isn't it clear that Jehovah is helping us to cope both physically and spiritually?

00:19:52.180 --> 00:20:00.180
As our shepherd, he is carrying us along in his loving arms.

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:14.180
Whether we're in lockdown, facing food shortages, or even in prison, his tender care will keep us going, and it will get us through to the end.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:26.180
You can be confident that with Jehovah's help and guidance, we will continue to organize relief efforts wherever they are needed.

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:34.180
But remember, Jehovah may also use you to come to the aid of others.

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:37.180
Pray for his spirit to guide you.

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:46.180
If you see an opportunity to help, take action. Hebrews 13 verse 16 says,

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:58.180
Do not forget to do good and to share what you have with others. For God is well pleased with such sacrifices.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:06.180
What a privilege we have to be used by Jehovah to provide tender care for one another.
