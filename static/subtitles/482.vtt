00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:10.210
What are the things Paul was telling Timothy to be absorbed in and to ponder over?

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:16.570
And in what sense do we today make our advancement clearly seen?

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.609
Let's open our Bibles to 1 Timothy chapter 4 and examine the context.

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:27.289
We begin in the last paragraph of this chapter, 1 Timothy chapter 4.

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:33.729
Verse 11 says, keep on giving these commands and teaching them.

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:36.009
Never let anyone look down on your youth.

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:39.409
Instead, become an example to the faithful ones.

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:46.210
In speaking, in conduct, in love, in faith, in chasteness.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.329
Until I come, continue applying yourself to public reading, to exhortation, to teaching,

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.409
do not neglect the gift in you that was given you through a prophecy when the body of elders

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:06.209
laid their hands on you, ponder over these things, be absorbed in them so that your advancement

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:09.090
may be plainly seen by all people.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.450
Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching, persevere in these things for

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.450
by doing this.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.969
You will save both yourself and those who listen to you.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:30.370
Well, first note that it says, be absorbed, not immersed, absorbed.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.010
What's the difference?

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.609
Well, you can drop a whole lung in into a pot of soup.

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:41.650
And if it's not in there very long, you can pull it back out and it's still an onion.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.049
And the soup tastes basically the same.

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.569
But what if you were to prepare that onion and then drop it in the soup and leave it there

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:51.090
for hours?

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:59.010
Well, then it absorbs into the soup, to the extent that we simply cannot remove it any longer.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.329
If we are absorbed in something, we become part of it.

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:11.050
The Greek word for be absorbed in literally translates in these things, be you.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.969
Some older translations say, give thyself wholly to.

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:24.169
So what is the soup as it were into which we are to be absorbed?

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:30.810
Well, verse 12 lists speaking, conduct, love, faith and chasteness.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.449
So we ask ourselves, are these qualities and actions what I am?

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:43.969
How is our advancement plainly seen, for instance, in the way we speak?

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.689
Now this is not referring to public speaking privileges.

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:53.810
Timothy had been a well-known traveling elder for upwards of ten years before he received

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.810
this letter from Paul.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:03.810
But his advancement would be plainly seen in his loyalty and in the way his speech reflected

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.650
his love and his faith.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.050
Now regarding speech, turn with me, please, to James 1.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:20.449
In this verse, James points out the impact that our speech can have on our worship.

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:23.490
He wrote James 1, 26.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:32.530
If any man thinks he is a worshiper of God but does not keep a tight reign on his tongue,

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.889
he is deceiving his own heart and his worship is futile.

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:45.250
Other older translations say, this man's religion is vain.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.889
This in fact is one of the texts that drew our brothers to the conclusion that there

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:54.729
is a distinction between true religion and false religion.

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:59.530
Never would we want to show the spirit of false religion deceiving ourselves into thinking

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:07.330
that as long as we do some good, God won't care if our words are mean or untrue.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.810
Now we keep a tight reign on our tongue and that expression, keep a tight reign on, reminds

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.889
us of James' horse illustration at James 3-3.

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:23.290
Keeping a tight reign on our tongue does not mean that we never speak, any more than keeping

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.329
a tight reign on a horse means that you never write it.

00:04:26.329 --> 00:04:34.810
No, a horse is valuable, powerful, beautiful, and it can be very useful when trained.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:41.089
So we use our gift of speech, but we control what we say so that it has the effect we want,

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:43.329
the effect Jehovah wants.

00:04:43.329 --> 00:04:48.730
Our speech can reveal the degree to which we have made spiritual progress.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.110
Now today most don't serve in congregations like Ephesus where Paul asked him to keep

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.889
working as a bulwark against false stories and misleading inspired statements and teachings

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:05.970
of demons, but we can set a powerful example in the way we speak.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.250
We work with people here in Bethel and in our congregations.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:17.529
The 133rd Psalm says that Jehovah's blessing is where brothers dwell together in unity.

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:24.250
First Peter 4-14 says that Jehovah's Spirit is resting upon the congregation.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.290
So there's a blessing when we work together.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:33.490
No one human has every quality needed to see a project through to its completion.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.810
And when we come together, we speak.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.089
We talk about how to get the job done.

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:43.850
At times we consider is this a good plan of action?

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.089
Is our work being done well?

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:47.370
Is it effective?

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.050
Is it being carried out in harmony with published guidelines?

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.410
Is it genuinely helpful?

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:59.009
In that process of people who have poured hours of work into a project could find that

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:05.970
their feelings are keenly attuned to those answers to those questions.

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:13.129
But what happens if someone takes exception to the way we have done our job?

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:18.850
What if they point out a problem, but their solution is worse than the problem itself?

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:23.889
Will we stop listening to them or stop respecting them?

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:29.129
Could we be grateful for their perspective that something's not quite right while at the

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:32.209
same time continuing to seek a solution?

00:06:32.209 --> 00:06:36.170
What words will we use?

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:43.129
This could be a very good opportunity for us to become an example to the faithful ones

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:45.769
in speaking.

00:06:45.769 --> 00:06:54.410
Have you ever noticed that some people consistently show gratitude and are rich with words of

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:57.769
commendation, even when they're offering correction?

00:06:57.769 --> 00:07:04.529
And it's not just a technical formula, the counsel, sandwich, commendation, counsel,

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:05.529
commendation.

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:08.050
No, it's valid.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:13.930
Words that took real observation and appreciation.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:19.170
Starting from a person who, on other occasions, only shows encouragement or you know those

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:23.170
elders who can enter into the most stressful situation and just get everybody laughing

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:28.730
and then offer frank counsel if needed, but then keep everybody in a good mood.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.209
It's an art.

00:07:30.209 --> 00:07:34.410
Never make the mistake of thinking he's just a natural.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:38.410
No, that is advancement.

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:42.089
So many in our Bethel family have this skill.

00:07:42.089 --> 00:07:45.050
We appreciate them.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.329
Become an example to the faithful ones in speaking.

00:07:48.329 --> 00:07:55.449
But Paul also mentions conduct and chasteness, how good it is to be surrounded by examples

00:07:55.449 --> 00:08:01.529
of those who truly delight in maintaining Jehovah's High moral standards.

00:08:01.529 --> 00:08:06.769
And first Timothy 412 also mentions becoming an example in love.

00:08:06.769 --> 00:08:12.370
If Timothy had been harsh or unkind in the way he dealt with his fellow believers, what

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:17.209
effect could that have had on all the good work he had accomplished already as a teacher

00:08:17.209 --> 00:08:19.810
and an overseer?

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:24.889
And we also said an example for the faithful ones in faith.

00:08:24.889 --> 00:08:34.809
Our faith can be seen in our ability to discern Jehovah's hand and the way he's backing

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:38.450
and blessing the work that we are doing.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:41.570
Can we build Ramapo under lockdown?

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:46.330
How can we make videos when we can't get 20 people together in a small space?

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:51.049
How do we make disciples if we have to stay six feet away from everyone?

00:08:51.049 --> 00:08:52.929
But what have we seen?

00:08:52.929 --> 00:08:54.690
Ramapo is ahead of schedule.

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:58.009
JW Broadcasting is more useful than ever.

00:08:58.009 --> 00:09:03.370
A congregation meetings are better attended than before and thousands of new disciples

00:09:03.409 --> 00:09:06.889
are still being baptized every week.

00:09:06.889 --> 00:09:07.889
Why?

00:09:07.889 --> 00:09:15.090
Because all things are possible with God if one has faith.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:23.730
Become an example to the faithful ones in speaking, in conduct, in love, in faith,

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.129
in chasteness.

00:09:25.129 --> 00:09:27.970
That's the soup.

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:29.250
Answer over these things.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:37.570
Be absorbed in them and in that way your advancement will be plainly seen.
