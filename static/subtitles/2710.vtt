00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.199
Many people believe that it doesn't matter which religion you choose,

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:15.880
but religions are like different roads that lead to the same destination,

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.379
lasting blessings from God.

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:21.379
But can that be true?

00:00:21.379 --> 00:00:26.420
Does God accept all forms of worship?

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.420
The Bible itself describes worship as two roads.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.420
One is spacious with many people on it.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.420
The others cramped with only a few finding it.

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:42.020
Only the cramped road represents acceptable worship,

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.619
leading to life and blessings from God.

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:51.789
How can we tell if we are on the correct path?

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.090
Imagine that you're lost.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.789
You stop someone to ask for directions.

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.390
One person says to an east.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.359
Another says to go west.

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:13.420
Finally, someone with a map shows you that the destination is actually north.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.549
Which one would you believe?

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:24.700
The Bible is like that map leading us to blessings from God.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.000
So why are there so many conflicting beliefs?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.280
For example, many religions teach that the human soul lives eternally in a spiritual realm,

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:47.439
while others believe that they are reborn in another body or form.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.939
This is just one example of the many religious beliefs and conflict with one another.

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.439
Could all religions really be teaching the truth?

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.560
According to the map, the dead know nothing at all.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.219
Due time, God will restore them to life

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:15.939
and righteous ones will live forever on earth.

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:19.340
If the Bible is clear on this teaching,

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.039
what about other matters such as our personal conduct?

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:26.340
We may belong to a religion,

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.860
but if our conduct offends God, our worship may be futile.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.460
The Bible teaches that many people today would be without self-controlled.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:45.340
Fears without love of goodness.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.020
However, it also says that true worshipers of God would be peaceable,

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:59.229
controlling their speech and actions.

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:03.430
Rather than saying there are many religions that please God,

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.030
the Bible says there is only one faith.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:16.030
True worship leads a person to a good relationship with God and everlasting life.
