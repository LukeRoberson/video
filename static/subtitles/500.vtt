00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:06.540
Well, throughout his earthly ministry, Jesus expressed and showed gratitude.

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.660
Let's look at what we can learn from what he said and what he did as a thankful person.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.960
First, Jesus' heartfelt prayers of thanks had an effect on others.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.199
Consider what happened the day after Jesus miraculously fed thousands

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.379
near Bethesseida along the sea of Galilee.

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:33.340
At John 6.23 we read that boats from Tiberius arrived near the place where they ate the bread

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:36.219
after the Lord had given thanks.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:43.100
That added comment after the Lord had given thanks must be in there for a reason.

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:51.939
For one thing, this tells us that the boats arrived not just near the place where a miracle had occurred the day before.

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:58.740
It also tells us that the boats arrived near the place where the Lord had given thanks.

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.260
That fact was recorded under inspiration many years later by the Apostle John.

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:13.140
And this shows us that Jesus' true disciples saw and remembered more than the miracle itself.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.299
They also witnessed and remembered Jesus' heartfelt prayer of thanks.

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:23.219
No doubt Jesus' disciples followed his good example.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:31.859
Let's look at two of the many fine qualities that Christians who imitate Jesus' good example display,

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:34.340
namely courage and humility.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.340
We begin with courage.

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:42.420
Jesus was moved by a deep sense of gratitude to be courageous.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.099
Why can we say this?

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:49.540
For one thing, because of something that he said during a very critical time for him,

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:53.379
you'll recall that in the Garden of Gethsemane,

00:01:54.099 --> 00:02:01.299
Jesus prayed out of great concern over the reproach that his death as one being charged with

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.659
blasphemy and sedition would bring to his heavenly Father.

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.419
In fact, Jesus implored Jehovah that a death of this sort might pass away from him.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.979
Yet despite such intense feelings, he said, not as I will, but as you will.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.620
What helped Jesus to make that courageous statement knowing what it would lead to?

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.780
We find the answer in Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 2 where it says in part of Jesus

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:38.259
that for the joy that was set before him, he endured a torture stake, despising shame, it said.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.580
So what helped Jesus to accept God's will for him?

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.379
The joy that was set before him.

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:54.419
That joy included his hope, yes, but above all his privilege to honor Jehovah by keeping his integrity.

00:02:54.419 --> 00:03:03.219
No matter how much his enemies opposed him, mocked him, or tried to keep shame on him and his heavenly Father,

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:09.300
Jesus put that out of his mind, despising shame and finding joy.

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:16.659
For the joy that was set before him, he gratefully and courageously accepted the privilege of

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:24.099
putting God's will ahead of his own, not as I will, but as you will, he said.

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.379
Do God's people today imitate Jesus grateful and courageous example?

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.740
Absolutely. Jesus' true followers today strive to do God's will despite threats of imprisonment,

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.819
actual imprisonment, torture, verbal abuse, loss of livelihood, and so forth.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.139
And when our brothers are unjustly imprisoned, we do all that we can for them,

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.500
including speaking up in their behalf and, of course, praying for them.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.900
Like Jesus' gratitude for the privilege to know and worship Jehovah,

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.060
and for the blessing of serving in this marvelous brotherhood that we have,

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.460
should move us to have and show courage in doing God's will today.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.500
And we allow gratitude, not shame, to take root and grow within us.

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:20.579
The second quality that we want to look at is this,

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.939
grateful Christians are humble people. Again, we'll consider Jesus' example.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.899
Every miracle that he performed and every teaching that he passed on to his disciples

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:39.540
was carried out in humility. Jesus never sought to draw attention to himself, did he?

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:45.779
Instead, what do we see? We see that he was grateful for the privilege to serve others

00:04:46.579 --> 00:04:50.980
and grateful for every positive response that he saw in others.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.660
And what he saw went beneath the surface.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:01.860
With that in mind, think about what happened during Jesus' last evening with his faithful apostles

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.259
when their imperfections were on full display, you could say.

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:11.699
For instance, out of all of them, only Jesus would wash the feet of the others.

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:17.379
Yet despite this, Jesus saw what? He saw the good in them,

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:21.699
and he was motivated to do something extraordinary for them.

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:29.699
Take note of what Jesus saw in them as we read Luke chapter 22 and verses 28 and 29,

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:32.980
where Jesus said this to them.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.259
However, you are the ones who have stuck with me in my trials,

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:45.459
and I make a covenant with you just as my father has made a covenant with me for a kingdom.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.620
What moved Jesus to do this for them?

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.779
Gratitude. You see, Jesus saw the good in them, didn't he? And he remembered it.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.779
You are the ones who have stuck with me in my trials, he said.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:06.339
What a wonderful gift he was offering to them, inviting them to share in his kingdom.

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:10.819
And what outstanding humility he displayed in doing this,

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:14.819
Jesus did not view himself as so great in his own eyes,

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.579
that he could overlook the good that was in his disciples.

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:25.459
He was humble, he appreciated the good, and he truly loved them to the end.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:32.660
Do we likewise show humility and gratitude, though faced with the imperfections of our brothers?

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:40.100
We must remember that Jesus never overreacted to the obvious faults and his disciples.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:45.939
Instead, he was grateful for their support, and he always looked for and found

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:51.620
and found the good in them. We should want to do the same for one another.

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:57.699
All of us need it. In fact, we need one another now more than ever, don't we?

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:04.740
The gratitude that we feel for being in pure worship should move us to seek the good in one

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:11.139
another always. Along with this, we should be moved to reach out and encourage one another

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:19.699
in any way that we can. This includes giving sincere commendation that stems from gratitude.

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:27.220
As Jesus said, you are the ones who have stuck with me in my trials. He was commending them,

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:34.019
acknowledging the good in them. He was thankful for it. We too should give sincere commendation

00:07:34.819 --> 00:07:39.459
to others one appropriate, and do it out of gratitude. We really mean it from the heart.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:45.300
So what have we considered this morning? We looked at how Jesus and

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:52.579
seer prayers of thanks were long remembered by his disciples. In fact, his prayers were remembered

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:57.620
as much as his miracles. As another example, think of what we read at John 1141,

00:07:58.259 --> 00:08:04.259
where when resurrecting Lazarus, Jesus offered a prayer and started off by saying, Father,

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:13.779
I thank you that you have heard me. That resurrection was astounding, but Jesus' prayer of thanks

00:08:13.779 --> 00:08:20.259
was also remembered. We also reviewed how Christ-like qualities such as courage and humility

00:08:20.819 --> 00:08:27.620
grow out of a grateful heart, and we considered ways in which we can show such qualities,

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:34.259
and Jehovah's people are definitely doing this. The numbers that we hear about of those now

00:08:34.259 --> 00:08:39.700
attending our meetings are proof of the grateful spirit founding God's people,

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:48.580
and in those who see the wisdom of returning while there's still time. We don't yet know

00:08:49.299 --> 00:08:56.419
when this present world situation will end, but we do know this. Jehovah's purpose will not fail.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:03.460
Jehovah and his Son will make certain that all causes for harm disappear forever,

00:09:04.019 --> 00:09:12.419
and aren't we grateful for that? Our job is this. We need to make certain that we are ready to

00:09:12.419 --> 00:09:19.539
accept the opportunities that may yet present themselves in doing Jehovah's will before the complete

00:09:19.539 --> 00:09:26.100
end arrives. This includes giving everything we've got to helping others come over to Jehovah's

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:35.700
side, the gratitude, and humility, the courage that result from a thankful spirit will help us to do this.
