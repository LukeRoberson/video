00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.360
Welcome to our update.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.359
In many parts of the world, conventions are underway.

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:14.359
In fact, as of early July, over 2.3 million have attended

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:19.359
the exercise patience, regional conventions in person.

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:24.359
Seeing old friends and making new ones at the conventions

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.359
is bringing so much joy to God's people.

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.359
And the program is truly spiritual food at the proper time.

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:37.359
Those who have already attended the convention

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:39.359
have benefited greatly.

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:43.359
And we are sure those who will be attending in the future

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:46.359
you're going to love it.

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:50.359
On June 1, tours of many Bethel facilities

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:52.359
resumed worldwide.

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:55.359
This has been so exciting for the visitors

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:57.359
and for the Bethel family.

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:04.069
Seeing the first tour group arrive was exciting,

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:08.069
so encouraging, knowing the efforts that they'd made to come.

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:12.700
But in honesty, I don't know who was more excited

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.700
the Bethel family or the tour group because we really love to have them here.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.840
My favourite part was the amazing surprise of walking in

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.840
and everyone being there and welcoming us and waving

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.840
and so many hugs. It was a great surprise.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:36.219
The welcome we got was amazing and we just kept on coming

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:38.219
and talking to us.

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:41.219
When I think about it, most of their lives

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:45.219
have been watching updates about Chelmsford on JW.org.

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:49.219
So to finally be here, I just never imagined it would be possible.

00:01:49.219 --> 00:02:00.969
It has been over a month now since tours have resumed.

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:02.969
And it has been amazing.

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.109
We are originally from the Philippines

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:09.110
and we are now in Canada.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.110
We drove about eight hours to get to where we got all.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.110
We planned the tour of Warwick in March of 2020.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.110
Here we are three years later.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.110
We said there's one trip that we have to plan

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.110
and make this year and it was coming to visit Bethel.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.680
I would definitely encourage families to plan the trip.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.680
It's definitely encouraging spiritually

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.680
but it's something that your kids are going to remember.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.919
There's so many things in the museum

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:42.919
that you cannot really absorb in just one visit.

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:46.919
So hopefully we will be back again.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.900
These brothers and sisters echo the inspired words of David

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.900
as recorded at Psalm 122, verse 1.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.900
I rejoiced when they said to me,

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.900
let us go to the house of Jehovah.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.900
We warmly invite you to experience the joy of touring Bethel.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.900
Please make a tour reservation on JW.org.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.900
You can find more information on the Bethel Tourist page

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.900
or you may contact your local branch office.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:34.900
As announced on JW.org on Wednesday evening, June 28, 2023,

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.900
the Ramapo project received a major approval.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.900
The town of Ramapo planning board unanimously approved

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.900
the site plan for the project.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.900
Although there are many permits and technical details to work through,

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.900
this approval now allows the project to proceed.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.900
We are grateful for the hard work of the town planning board

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.900
and all the brothers and sisters working behind the scenes.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.900
And we thank Jehovah for his continued blessing on this project.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:19.149
In May 2022, Brother Dennis Christensen was released from prison.

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:24.149
Shortly after we interviewed him and his wife, Irina,

00:04:24.149 --> 00:04:27.149
as you watch the following video,

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:32.149
notice what helped them to endure and remain faithful.

00:04:32.149 --> 00:04:39.399
We were at the meeting of our congregation in the city of Ariel.

00:04:43.019 --> 00:04:47.019
But then one of our ministerial servants came running to me and said,

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:49.019
Dennis, you have to go in the hallway.

00:04:49.019 --> 00:04:52.019
Okay, okay, I went then in the corridor

00:04:52.019 --> 00:04:56.019
and there were people standing there in masks.

00:04:56.019 --> 00:05:01.019
A lot of police officers and a lot of FSP people.

00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:08.930
They showed their ideas and said that they were going to search our hall.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.930
After that, they also showed me some paper.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.930
There was a ruling that I was the main one in this case

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:22.209
and that they would arrest me for two days.

00:05:22.209 --> 00:05:25.209
I thought, it's no big deal going to be resolved.

00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:27.209
Two days is something I can live with.

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:31.209
Other brothers and sisters were in prison before me and I could do it too.

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:34.209
And I was sure too that Jehovah was protecting me.

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:48.579
The hardest part was being separated from my wife, Irina.

00:05:48.579 --> 00:05:53.579
The detention center is located so that you can't generally see the prisoners, right?

00:05:54.579 --> 00:05:58.579
I tried to find a place where I could see his window

00:05:58.579 --> 00:06:02.579
and just from his window, he could see me well.

00:06:02.579 --> 00:06:06.579
And so we agreed that I would go there.

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:08.579
Dennis told me what time.

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:12.579
That was my favorite time.

00:06:12.579 --> 00:06:14.579
You might say of the whole day.

00:06:14.579 --> 00:06:16.579
I was looking forward to one pm.

00:06:16.579 --> 00:06:19.579
My opportunity to see Irina.

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:22.579
It was only five to ten minutes.

00:06:22.579 --> 00:06:27.819
For two years we had this routine.

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:30.819
Irina came every day.

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:37.819
In the snow, in the rain, bright sunshine, no matter what the weather was.

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:40.819
Every day she was there.

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:45.819
It was our little secret, which we revealed now.

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:52.329
For two years we didn't tell it to anyone at all.

00:06:52.329 --> 00:06:55.329
I really tried my best to be a good husband.

00:06:55.329 --> 00:07:01.329
When I was in the detention center, I tried to call her twice a month.

00:07:01.329 --> 00:07:05.329
I tried to write her letters five times a week.

00:07:05.329 --> 00:07:10.639
I had friends supporting me, coming over, visiting.

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:13.639
I got a lot of letters and so did Dennis.

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:17.639
They were people who said, you are having a hard time.

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:20.639
You can call and text, we'll come over.

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:24.639
They offered all sorts of help and I'm very grateful to them.

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:35.089
Doing the trial, I particularly remember the support of the brothers and sisters.

00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:38.089
That's amazing.

00:07:38.089 --> 00:07:46.860
When I got my final sentence of six years,

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.860
then there were a lot of people in the audience.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:57.180
How I dealt with it.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.180
I was very strict about my attitude.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:05.180
Because I knew basically, as I said in Proverbs,

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:11.180
if you are sad, then your strength also disappears.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:18.009
And I knew it would be a long struggle and I wanted to endure.

00:08:18.009 --> 00:08:24.009
I tried to read the Bible every day, like I was supposed to, and to meditate.

00:08:24.009 --> 00:08:28.009
I did have a special notebook where I wrote down good thoughts

00:08:28.009 --> 00:08:32.860
from the Bible that would strengthen me.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:39.860
For example, I often remembered Isaiah, chapter 30, verse 15,

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.860
where it says that we have to keep calm and trust in Jehovah,

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:49.419
and that is our strength.

00:08:49.419 --> 00:08:52.419
And very often I prayed that I had peace in my heart,

00:08:52.419 --> 00:08:56.419
that Jehovah would help me to keep my joy, to be happy,

00:08:56.419 --> 00:08:59.419
because I wanted it to be that way.

00:08:59.419 --> 00:09:04.419
I often thought, yes, okay, you can steal my freedom.

00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:08.419
Yes, you can make me not see my family,

00:09:08.419 --> 00:09:12.419
not to be able to hug them as often as I'd like.

00:09:12.419 --> 00:09:16.419
But inside, I will not let you steal my peace.

00:09:16.419 --> 00:09:20.419
I will not let you steal my joy.

00:09:20.419 --> 00:09:23.419
I want to be happy, to serve Jehovah,

00:09:23.419 --> 00:09:27.419
to do as he wants, because he is a happy father.

00:09:27.419 --> 00:09:32.379
Daniels once wrote this interesting phrase,

00:09:32.379 --> 00:09:35.379
if you want to be happy, make others happy.

00:09:35.379 --> 00:09:39.379
And that thought helped me a lot.

00:09:39.379 --> 00:09:41.379
And I was always busy.

00:09:41.379 --> 00:09:44.379
I was always looking for opportunities to help someone,

00:09:44.379 --> 00:09:49.379
who to visit, who to bring groceries to, or to visit the sick.

00:09:49.379 --> 00:09:58.570
A member of the prison staff said to me,

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:01.570
Dennis, I can see that you're very joyful.

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:05.570
I said, yes, I'll be free soon.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:08.570
All my thoughts are there right now.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:11.570
It's like, I'm not here.

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:13.570
I'm already out there.

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:16.570
Then he said to me, look, Christensen,

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:18.570
you've never been here.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.570
You've always been on the outside.

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:22.570
You've always been free.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:25.570
You've always been joyful and happy.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:28.570
I've also imagined that day many times,

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:32.570
when I go out, when I see my brothers and sisters again,

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:35.570
my family, and when I hug them.

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:54.350
I was amazed at the number of people who were already there.

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:59.350
They got there early, and they were people from completely different cities.

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:30.529
We always knew ahead of time that there would be a few people

00:11:30.529 --> 00:11:33.529
who would meet us at Copenhagen Airport.

00:11:33.529 --> 00:11:37.539
But it was a great feeling.

00:11:37.539 --> 00:11:42.539
When we saw so many brothers and sisters there,

00:11:42.539 --> 00:11:45.539
who were shouting with joy?

00:11:45.539 --> 00:11:48.539
I hugged everybody.

00:11:48.539 --> 00:11:51.539
I had waited a long time for this,

00:11:51.539 --> 00:11:54.539
so there were a lot of emotions there.

00:11:54.539 --> 00:12:04.070
Now we're back in Denmark.

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:08.070
Here we have to start a new life, start from scratch.

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:17.700
We had an available and unique experience

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.700
that we really want to use to help others.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:26.970
You could say that prison is a very good school

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:29.970
to polish your Christian qualities.

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:35.269
I'm out now, and I'm very happy about that.

00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:37.269
But my prayers for my brothers and sisters,

00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:40.269
who are still in prison, haven't changed.

00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:44.269
On the contrary, I pray for them even more now

00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:47.269
because I know what they're facing there.

00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:54.570
It's not always easy, but I'm also sure

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:58.570
that Jehovah helps them as he helps me.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:11.000
Brother and sister Christensen,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
thank you for sharing your experience with us.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
We are encouraged by your patient endurance.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
I recall many years ago when I was working

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
with the brothers behind the iron curtain,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
we saw their faith and integrity.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
It was so touching and that has stayed with me until now.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
When we see vivid accounts or hear reports about the faith

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
and determination of our brothers in countries under ban,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
today doesn't it strengthen and inspire us?

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000
We continue to pray for the over 180 brothers

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
and sisters worldwide who are presently in prison

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
for their faith.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
As you watched the interview,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
did you notice what helped the Christensen to endure?

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Brother Christensen said that daily Bible reading

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
and meditation helped him.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.000
He wrote strengthening thoughts from the Bible in a notebook.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Brother and sister Christensen encouraged each other

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
by regular letters and phone calls

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
and wasn't it touching to hear how seeing each other briefly

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.309
from a distance strengthened them?

00:14:35.309 --> 00:14:41.309
They were also built up by the support of their spiritual family

00:14:41.309 --> 00:14:44.309
and they did not just receive support.

00:14:44.309 --> 00:14:50.309
They looked for opportunities to help and encourage others.

00:14:50.309 --> 00:14:53.309
Do you remember what Dennis wrote to Irina?

00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:58.309
If you want to be happy, make others happy.

00:14:58.309 --> 00:15:04.309
This reminds us of Jesus' words recorded at Acts 20-35.

00:15:04.309 --> 00:15:08.309
There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.

00:15:08.309 --> 00:15:14.980
One of the scriptures that Dennis said helped him through his trial

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.980
was Isaiah 30-15.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:19.980
There we read,

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:25.980
your strength will be in keeping calm and showing trust.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:31.580
We are pleased to inform you that the full interview

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.580
of brother and sister Christensen will be made available

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:38.580
on JW.org in the future.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:43.580
Yes, just as Jehovah strengthened the Christensen to endure their trial,

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:47.580
he will help all of us to endure faithfully

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:50.580
as we keep trusting in Jehovah.

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:57.860
Dear brothers and sisters, we take note of your patient endurance.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:02.860
Please know that we love you all very much.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.860
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.860
this is JW Broadcasting.
