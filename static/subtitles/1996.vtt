00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:11.240
An introduction to the Book of Acts, the Gospel writer Luke wrote Acts of Apostles.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:18.239
Chapters 1 to 12 of Acts primarily cover the activity of the Apostle Peter.

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:24.239
Chapters 13 to 28 feature the activity of the Apostle Paul.

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:27.239
Because Luke accompanied Paul on some of his travels,

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.239
Luke was an eyewitness to certain events he recorded.

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:41.640
The Book of Acts contains a detailed history of the beginnings of the Christian congregation and its rapid growth.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.640
The account commences about where Luke's Gospel account ends.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.640
Acts covers a period of approximately 28 years.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.640
From Jesus' ascension to heaven in 33 CE to about 61 CE,

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:04.920
while Paul is still under house arrest in Rome, awaiting the outcome of his appeal to Caesar.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.920
The Gospel of Luke and Acts of Apostles were written just a few years apart,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.920
and were both addressed to the same individual, theophilus.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.900
Did you know?

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.900
When Luke wrote his Gospel account, he addressed theophilus with a title most excellent,

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.900
possibly indicating that theophilus had been a prominent official.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.900
However, Luke does not use that title in Acts,

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.909
which could suggest that he was writing to theophilus as a mature Christian.

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.909
Acts of Apostles contains 28 chapters.

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:53.909
In chapter 1, Jesus tells his disciples that they will be witnesses of him to the most distant part of the earth.

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.909
He then ascends to heaven.

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.909
Chapter 2 records that 10 days later, on Pentecost 33 CE,

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.909
Holy Spirit is poured out on about 120 disciples.

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.909
Later that day, about 3,000 people are baptized.

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:21.909
Chapters 3-9 relate early examples of how the disciples zealously preach and perform miraculous signs.

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:29.909
Although they face strong opposition, they boldly continue to spread the Christian message.

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:35.909
Stephen, an early Christian, is even murdered because of his faith.

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:41.909
A man named Saul witnesses and approves of the execution of Stephen.

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:47.909
However, not long after that, Jesus appears to Saul on the road to Damascus.

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:54.909
Subsequently, Saul becomes a Christian and is later known as the Apostle Paul.

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:59.909
Chapters 10-11 describe a period of peace enjoyed by the disciples.

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:07.909
Jehovah uses the Apostle Peter to expand the preaching work to include Gentiles or non-Jews.

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:16.900
During this time of expansion, the term Christians is coined to identify Christ's disciples.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.900
In Chapter 12, persecution breaks out again.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.900
Herod puts the Apostle James to death and imprisons Peter, who is later released by an angel.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:36.900
Chapters 13-21 describe Paul's three eventful missionary tours from about 47-56 CE.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.900
Paul travels to Cyprus and parts of Asia Minor during his first missionary tour.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:50.530
His second missionary tour takes him back to Asia Minor as well as to Macedonia and Greece.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:58.219
Paul's third missionary tour covers some four years and ends in Jerusalem.

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:08.740
Paul writes six inspired letters during the period that includes his second and third tours.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:15.740
According to one estimate, the Book of Acts records Paul traveling nearly 10,000 miles.

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:26.649
In Chapter 21, Paul is wrongfully arrested in Jerusalem.

00:04:26.649 --> 00:04:30.649
Chapters 22-26 relay Paul's defense.

00:04:30.649 --> 00:04:39.649
He appears before Felix, Governor of Judea, his successor Festus, and King Herodegrip of the Second.

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:48.410
In the course of his defense, Paul appeals to Caesar, the highest Roman authority of the time.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:55.410
Chapters 27-28 describe Paul's arduous journey to Rome, which includes a shipwreck.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:04.740
Acts concludes with Paul under house arrest awaiting trial in Rome.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:11.740
Despite confinement, he remains busy preaching to all those who come to him.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:18.740
As you read Acts of Apostles, note how the disciples were empowered by Holy Spirit,

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.740
how they witnessed fearlessly despite fierce persecution,

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:29.740
and how they used legal means to defend their right to preach the good news of God's kingdom.
