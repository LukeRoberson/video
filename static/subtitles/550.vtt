00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:08.480
What is more important, finishing an assignment, or how we go about carrying out the assignment?

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.400
Well, our text for today uses the Day of Atonement to illustrate that the way Jesus went about

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.679
living his life was actually even more important than that one act of salvation.

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:23.280
Now, why?

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.320
Well, that's because the way Jesus lived his life carried out his ministry,

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.719
addressed Satan's challenge.

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:37.200
And Jesus proved that doing things Jehovah's way is the right way to live.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:45.439
Thus, Jesus by his life upheld Jehovah's sovereignty, and that made his sacrifice acceptable to Jehovah.

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:52.159
So what are some ways in which Jesus upheld or vindicated Jehovah's sovereignty?

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:54.880
And how can we imitate Jesus in our assignments?

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.920
Well, there's many things we could talk about today, but let's just consider three ways.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.480
At one, is that Jesus worked on Jehovah's initiatives, not his own.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.560
Now, as we know, Jesus could calm storms, he could heal people, he could feed people,

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.079
and so Jesus could have decided, well, yes, I'm going to preach, but I'm also going to focus

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:24.400
my energies on helping people, setting up relief activities, healing of the sick, helping the poor.

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:28.159
Or the people wanted to make Jesus king.

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:34.879
He could have decided, well, let me let them make, let me be king, and then I can address some

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:42.000
of the problems of the day. Or Jesus loved children, and people loved the way Jesus taught.

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:47.439
So Jesus could have thought, well, I'm going to preach, but I'm going to focus my energy on

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.400
setting up schools so that I can teach young people to learn about Jehovah.

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:56.079
See, Jesus could have done all of those things, but what did he do?

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.480
Well, let's look at Luke chapter four, in verse 43, and notice what it quotes him saying in

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.840
response to the crowds, wanting him to stay and help them. Luke chapter four, verse 43,

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.960
but he said to them, I must also declare the good news of the kingdom of God to other cities,

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:24.479
because for this I was sent. Jesus never lost sight of why he was there. What his assignment was,

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:29.439
he stayed focused, and he focused his energies on what Jehovah wanted done.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.479
Well, how can we imitate Jesus in our assignments? Well, as we know, there are many things that we

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:41.520
could get involved in as an organization. Good things, expanding our relief activities,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.759
helping the poor, teaching, setting up schools to teach other people, or many other initiatives.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.639
And there's nothing wrong with us presenting a new idea or initiative to our oversight.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.919
But what do we do once a decision is made? Well, we follow the direction we throw ourselves into

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:07.360
the initiatives given to us from our oversight. See, we subject ourselves to what Jehovah wants

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.919
his organization to do and how he wants it done. It's not about what we think the organization should

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:21.840
be doing. It's about what Jehovah wants done. Let's look at another example. Jesus worked within

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.800
the organizational structures that Jehovah had in place or allowed to be in place. Now, Jesus saw

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.639
the hypocrisy, the corruption, the inefficiencies of the Jewish arrangements that were there in place

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:40.879
at the time. Other arrangements, though not bad, had served their purpose, or were only temporary,

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:46.960
were soon to end. What would Jesus do? We remember the encounters recorded in Matthew chapter 8,

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.400
in verse 4, when he healed the man with leprosy. What did he tell the man to do? He says,

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.199
go show yourself to the priest. Now, Jesus knew the man was clean, but yet he told him, follow the

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:05.599
arrangement. In Galatians chapter 4, in verse 4, it says that Jesus was under law. We know that he

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:11.520
observed the Sabbath. Now, we know that Jehovah established the Sabbath as a temporary arrangement

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.439
to teach people, to take time to meditate on spiritual things. Well, Jesus understood the

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:22.720
principle behind the Sabbath. He meditated on spiritual things every day, and he knew it was soon

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:29.600
going to end, and yet he respected and followed the arrangement. It's interesting, regarding

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.439
the Pharisees, it records them saying in Matthew chapter 23 and verse 3, all they tell you do

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:39.839
and observe. He says, listen to the Pharisees, even though they weren't doing the right thing,

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:45.439
why? Because that was the arrangement. See, Jesus worked within the arrangement,

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:53.360
so Jehovah had in place or had not yet seen fit to change. So how can we imitate Jesus in our

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:00.000
assignments? Well, even within the organization, we may see functions, departments, processes

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.600
that, personally, we may perceive as inefficient or complicated or out of date. Well, Jehovah,

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.279
obviously, has allowed these structures to be in place or has not yet seen fit to change them.

00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:19.920
So do we see how supporting them, working with them, not working around these arrangements,

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:26.800
is another way of us supporting Jehovah's right to rule his way? So again, another example,

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:35.839
the third, Jesus understood the limits of his authority. In Luke, excuse me, Matthew chapter 11

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:43.920
and verse 27, Jesus said, all things have been handed over to me by my father, all things.

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:52.639
And yet Jesus understood that his authority had boundaries. Remember the account in Luke chapter 12,

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:57.759
where the man in the crowd said to Jesus, he says, teacher, tell my brother to divide his

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:03.600
inheritance with me. What did Jesus do? Okay, well, let's talk about that. No. He says, man,

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.959
who appointed me judge or arbiter between you two? Wait a minute, I thought you had all authority.

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:15.120
Or when the Phoenician woman came to Jesus and asked him to heal her daughter, what did Jesus say?

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.399
He says, I was not sent to anyone except the law sheep of the house of Israel.

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:26.720
Now, even though Jesus did help her, we see his words illustrate that he understood that his

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:33.920
authority had limits. In fact, notice what he says is recorded in John chapter 5 and verse 19.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:45.279
John 5, 19, therefore in response, Jesus said to them, most truly, I say to you, the son cannot do

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:52.480
a single thing of his own initiative, but only what he sees the father doing. For whatever things

00:06:52.480 --> 00:07:01.279
that one does, these things the son does also in like manner. The son cannot do a single thing,

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:09.199
but he has all authority. So how can we imitate Jesus in our assignments? Well, I know for me,

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:15.839
the governing body provides a beautiful example of that. Periodically, we will get a call in our

00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:20.879
department from a governing body member who may be as observed something regarding one of our branch

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:27.600
facilities or has a suggestion or a concern. And invariably, at the end of the call, the brother

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:34.560
will say, now, remember, this is just my opinion and observation. Please do not take this as direction.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.680
The members of the publishing committee may have a different perspective. Isn't that beautiful?

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:46.240
Even the governing body members understand that their authority has boundaries. What a good

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:52.959
example for us to follow. As we know in the secular world, the more responsibility one has,

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:59.360
the more authority they have. But isn't it true that it's exactly the opposite within Jehovah's

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:05.920
Organization? The more responsibility we have, the more checks and balances there are,

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:11.199
that limit our authority. And to me, that is a beautiful arrangement that Jehovah has said in

00:08:11.279 --> 00:08:18.240
place. And that ensures that it is impossible for one man to rise up and take control of the

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:23.839
earthly part of Jehovah's Organization. It's not possible. It is clear, Jehovah is taking the lead

00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:30.160
through his son, Jesus. And see, the point is that when we understand our place in the arrangement,

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:38.799
we uphold Jehovah's authority and his right to rule his way. Now, we contrast all of that with

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:45.679
Satan, who promotes independence and doing his own things, sets up rival and competing organization

00:08:45.679 --> 00:08:52.720
arrangements and has no idea of the limits of his authority. So really, it drives home the point in

00:08:52.720 --> 00:09:06.110
Luke 9 and verse 23. Let's read that together. Luke 9 and verse 23, then he went on to say it all,

00:09:06.909 --> 00:09:13.950
if anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake day after

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:21.629
day and keep following me. See, when we choose to follow Christ, when we chose to follow Jesus,

00:09:21.629 --> 00:09:27.389
we said we are going to put our will in the background and we're going to submit to Jehovah's

00:09:27.389 --> 00:09:33.470
will. So in summary, Jesus example shows us that it's not just finishing an assignment that's

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:39.950
important, but also how we go about doing that assignment. So the question for today is,

00:09:40.909 --> 00:09:49.230
does the way I am accomplishing my assignments demonstrate that I support Jehovah's sovereignty?

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:54.830
So as we contemplate Jesus' death and ransom, may we also think about his example, even just

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:59.870
in these three ways we've discussed, and may we be resolved to imitate Jesus by one,

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:07.549
working on the things Jehovah wants done, using the arrangements that he has put in place

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:14.029
and within the limits of our own authority. And in this way, we too will demonstrate that we

00:10:14.029 --> 00:10:28.190
believe that doing things Jehovah's way is the right way to live.
