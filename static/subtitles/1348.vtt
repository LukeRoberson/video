00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:05.389
I love to preach, I love to talk about Jehovah.

00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:10.390
Whenever I'd read the experiences of pioneers and missionaries in the earbooks,

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.390
I wanted to feel the same joy and the same feeling that they had.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:20.390
When I heard about the announcement about the campaign, I knew that that was my chance.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.390
The first challenge was the pressure I got from others.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.390
Why go so far?

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.390
You could use that money to travel somewhere more beautiful.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.390
You could even travel to another country.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.390
These types of comments did affect me a bit.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.390
Other times it was more a question of finances.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.390
I once had to decide whether I would accept an opportunity to work at a good job in the public sector,

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.390
or whether to turn that opportunity down.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:54.880
But participating in that campaign was my chance to do more for Jehovah.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.880
I knew this experience would be life-changing.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.880
Throughout the campaign, we met so many sincere people,

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.879
some who had never heard Jehovah's name, or who didn't even know what Bible was.

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:13.879
One experience that stuck with me was when I tried explaining to someone what the Bible was.

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:19.879
And then her eyes just beamed when she understood that it was a message from God to her personally.

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:38.109
There's a Bible student who is indigenous.

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:43.109
And whenever you talk about Jehovah, her eyes always light up.

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:47.109
She always asks to learn more about Jehovah.

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:49.109
We were studying over the public telephone,

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:53.109
because she lives in a village that's about five days journey away.

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:56.109
But even though it was challenging, she made it to the meetings.

00:01:56.109 --> 00:02:00.109
She would bring the whole family, sometimes up to 20 people,

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:02.109
who would walk into the Kingdom Hall.

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:05.109
I would bring a Bible, a phone and a tablet,

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:08.110
and I would pass them around and try to help them.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.110
There's no doubt that having these experiences was well worth it.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.110
I know that participating in this campaign was the best decision.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.110
I started to truly see Jehovah as a real friend.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.110
And it was also wonderful to spend time with a variety of brothers and sisters during the campaign.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.110
It hurt on me mature spiritually.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.110
I planned to go for a month and ended up staying there for five years.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:42.199
If I could, I'd do it all over again.

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:44.199
My family owns a guest house,

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:48.199
and my father said that we were going to host a group for a campaign.

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:56.229
But I never had contact with Jehovah's Witnesses before.

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:58.229
When the group arrived,

00:02:58.229 --> 00:03:02.229
the pastor of my church said that I should be very careful

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:05.229
about having contact with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:12.860
So I was. I did everything I could to avoid contact with them.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.860
I would see them leaving early for the ministry.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.490
But one day, there was a sister that didn't go out.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.490
And I thought she's going to try to preach to me.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:30.020
And that's what she did.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.020
So since she was already staying at the end,

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.020
I started studying with her.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.620
But at first, it was just to prove her wrong.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.620
As I kept studying, though,

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.620
I could see that water was learning was really making sense.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:52.050
So I couldn't say that that wasn't the truth.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:58.050
I would also notice the brothers and sisters playing guitar, singing,

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:03.050
and I thought it was so beautiful to see how joyful they always were.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.050
I met the witnesses in April 2016,

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.050
and in October, I became an unbaptized publisher.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.050
In January 2017, I was baptized,

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.050
and I've been regular pioneering for two years.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.050
I'm sure that all of this happened

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:23.050
because Jehovah heard what I prayed for a few days before.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.050
I had had to go to the hospital, and I had asked,

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.050
God, help me survive,

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.050
so that I can get to know you,

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.050
because I know I don't know the truth about you yet.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.050
He gave me what I asked for.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.050
He sent the brothers just at the right time with the campaign.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.050
I'm sure it was Jehovah who sent them.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.050
Someone could be praying for help to learn about Jehovah.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.050
And he would direct a preaching campaign with brothers from many places

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.050
to help honest-hearted people.
