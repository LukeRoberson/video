00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:10.230
When we look around our congregation, we're sure to find brothers and sisters young and old who can use our help in a spiritual or practical way.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:20.230
Sometimes when we look, we're amazed at what some with seemingly impossible limitations are already doing for themselves with the help of God's Spirit.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:27.230
Imagine wanting to study the Bible and preach the good news in spite of a severe handicap.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:36.619
We met a sister who, from birth, faced that very challenge.

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:50.619
I'm Sabina Hernandez and I'm from Panama. I have the honor of participating in theocratic activities. I just have to do it a little differently, but I enjoy it just the same.

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:54.619
Well, I was born handicapped.

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:59.619
It was a C-section birth with a lot of complications.

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:07.620
So, I can't use my hands and feet as fully as most people can. I can't walk.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.620
We went to the doctors every week and I would miss work just to take her.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.620
They helped her with her therapy and I had to do a lot of things for her at home.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:26.620
The doctors wanted to keep me for some medical experiments, but my mom flat out refused to accept that idea.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:34.620
But thankfully, my mind is normal. Although some of my friends tell me I have a few screws loose, but I don't think so.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:42.180
As far as growing up in the neighborhood in Torillo, everything was normal.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.180
I used to fight with my brothers all the time and I played with all the kids in the neighborhood.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.750
Then, one day, the brothers came preaching door to door.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.750
So, we started the study and things progressed. I used to ask myself,

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.750
how am I going to teach her to handle the Bible if she can't use her hands?

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.750
About what I didn't know was how well she could use her tongue.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.750
I would say to scripture and she would look it up with her tongue.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.750
Many times, she would find it before I did.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.750
It all happened gradually, but I knew that what I was learning was very valuable.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.750
I can't say it was because of one particular scripture or anything like that.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.750
It was really just getting to know the very personality of Jehovah and the way the brothers and sisters treated me.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.750
In order to go to the kingdom hall or to the assemblies, the brothers have to carry me.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.750
And of course, as I kept growing, I got heavier and heavier.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.750
So, that wasn't easy, you know. When I got baptized, I had affection for Jehovah.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.750
But as I kept growing spiritually and getting to know Him better, I began to really treasure the privilege of serving Him.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:08.189
The idea of talking to others made me feel terrified, scared to death, and all panicky.

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:14.189
But all the encouragement I got from the brothers, friends, traveling overseers,

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:18.189
and all the assistants my mom has given me were a big help.

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:22.189
Now I really love preaching door to door.

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:29.189
I have a little list of phone numbers that I've put together from homes in our congregation's territory.

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:31.189
People that know me have come up to me and said,

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:33.189
I got a phone call from your daughter the other day.

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:37.539
And I was like, what? My daughter?

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:43.539
The sisters are so kind, and they support me by bringing some of their Bible studies to my house

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:46.539
so that I can share with them in the study.

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:51.539
What I can't do with my hands, I can do almost anything with my tongue.

00:03:51.539 --> 00:04:02.030
I type on the computer with a pencil or pen.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:10.539
And then when it's ready, I print it, fold it, and put it into an envelope.

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:12.539
Then I take it to sisters at the Kingdom Hall.

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:20.939
They're my secretaries, and they leave it at night at homes where the householders are out working.

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:26.939
It really makes you happy, because you know it makes others happy.

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:30.939
I left a letter that Sabina had written with an unmarried couple.

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:36.939
They made arrangements right away to please Jehovah, and were legally married.

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:41.939
Jehovah has been so kind to me, you know?

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:48.939
When your handicapped and someone helps you, or you're an older person and you get the necessary help,

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:53.939
that really changes your life in an incredible way.

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:56.939
I want to put some people think they have to go and encourage her,

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:59.939
but when they get there, the opposite happens.

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:05.750
She's the one that encourages them.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.750
Do not be afraid for I am with you.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.750
Do not gaze about for I am your God.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.750
I will fortify you.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.750
I will really help you.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:29.819
I will really keep fast hold of you with my right hand of righteousness.

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:41.560
Sister Sabina Hernandez has been approved this month as an auxiliary pioneer.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:06:02.240
Because if Sabina can do it, all the rest of us can too.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.240
Sabina appreciates the loving assistance from her family and congregation.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:13.240
But as we saw, she's not content to let her limitations stop her from doing what she can.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:19.240
She's able to search for spiritual treasures and take what she learns to people in her ministry.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:27.240
After 30 years in the truth, her determined example motivated her own brother to study the Bible and get baptized.
