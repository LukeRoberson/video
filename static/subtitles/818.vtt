WEBVTT

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.700
I spoke to Jehovah just before I stepped out here and I asked him,

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.500
please, don't abandon me.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.359
If I've ever needed you, I need you now.

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.600
Why? Well, it's because of all of these beautiful sheep

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.839
that I have the privilege to speak to for 19 minutes.

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.879
So I want to make the most of these 19 minutes because sometimes

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:33.979
we have to make adjustments.

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:37.079
Now, you may have heard of a few adjustments in our

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.979
understanding of things already today.

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:45.079
And there could be more adjustments that will have to be made

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.280
later on.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.179
Now, you may recall that we used to think a certain way

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:57.479
some 10 years ago about the following matter.

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:03.579
We felt that some of the anointed would survive Armageddon

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.379
and move right on into the paradise with the other sheep

00:01:08.379 --> 00:01:15.379
and maybe stay there for a given time and then be brought to

00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:17.879
life in heaven.

00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:23.579
But as we understand it, some things that Jehovah will

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.980
not permit us to see even though we read over it many, many

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:35.780
times, we can't see it until Jehovah puts the light on it.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.079
And what I'm about to reveal to you today, Jehovah is

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:45.780
behind it, not the governing body, not any human here on the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.879
earth, but Jehovah God.

00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:51.379
He helps us to see things.

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:59.180
Now, you may recall Matthew chapter 24 verses 29 through 31.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.980
You've read it many times, I have to, but notice what it

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.979
says, even though we felt a little different earlier on

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.180
when we read it, verse 29, immediately after the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.180
tribulation of those days.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.180
Now remember this, immediately after the tribulation of those

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.979
days, the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:33.379
it slight and the stars will fall from heaven and the powers

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.580
of the heavens will be shaken.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.180
Then the sign of the sun of man will appear in heaven and all

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.280
the tribes of the earth will beat themselves in grief.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.879
And they will see the sun of man coming on the clouds of

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:56.680
heaven with power and great glory.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.379
And he will send out his angels with a great trumpet sound.

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.379
Now note the following.

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.879
And they will gather his chosen ones together from the

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:16.879
four winds from one extremity of the heavens to the other

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.879
extremity.

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.680
Now do you see the point?

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.680
We understand now that all of Christ's anointed brothers will

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.879
be in heaven with him before Armageddon starts.

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.879
But that's the understanding that we have today.

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.080
And this is exciting.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.879
We think so because of a few reasons.

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:47.080
And here are a few.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.479
But a few of the other sheep.

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:54.080
Have expressed a concern on this subject.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.280
They have said that does this new understanding mean

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.879
that we will lose all the anointed Christians,

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:12.780
including the governing body, just when we need them the most?

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.579
Will we feel abandoned in our time and need?

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:24.279
Well, let me reassure you that you will not be abandoned.

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:27.879
And that's what this talk is all about.

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:32.279
You need not to think that you will be abandoned

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:38.079
because of the anointed not being in your midst any longer.

00:04:38.079 --> 00:04:41.279
So we're going to discuss three questions.

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:44.779
And here they are if you're writing things down.

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:50.680
Number one, what will not happen when the last of the anointed

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.439
leaves the earthly scene?

00:04:54.439 --> 00:05:03.740
And number two, how do we know that such things will not happen?

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:06.339
What will happen?

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:08.540
So we're going to look at these questions.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.939
First, then what will not happen?

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:18.240
Well, I'd like to tell you very briefly two sad stories

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.139
to illustrate what will not happen.

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:25.639
Now, here's sad story number one.

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:28.740
Do you remember Jehovah Da?

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.339
He was a faithful high priest, one of the best.

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:36.839
When he died, he was given an unusual honor.

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:40.439
He was buried with the kings.

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:44.839
During his life, he protected the young king, Jehoes,

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:50.339
and helped him to be a good king who stayed faithful to Jehovah.

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:59.139
But when old Jehovah Da died, the young king soon went bad.

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:06.439
He listened to wicked princes, and he turned away from Jehovah.

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:10.389
That's sad story number one.

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:15.790
On his heels, we have sad story number two.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:22.389
Remember that the apostle John took great joy in his spiritual children.

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:24.589
He was a good influence on them.

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:28.689
He helped many Christians to remain faithful.

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:32.790
But what happened when John died?

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:38.089
Well, he was the sole surviving apostle.

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:42.189
The last restraint against apostasy.

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:47.889
So after John passed off the scene, he was not.

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:54.189
It was not long before something happened.

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:56.189
What was it?

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.889
What happened when John died?

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:07.139
Well, the last restraint against apostasy.

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:10.339
He was the last restraint.

00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:13.189
And now he's gone.

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:18.389
So after John passed off the earthly scene,

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:25.689
it was not long before apostasy spreads like wildfire.

00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:27.990
And within a few decades,

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:34.389
the Christian congregation went off into captivity in Babylon of the Great,

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:38.790
the world empire of false religion.

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:44.990
Now, why mention those sad stories?

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:51.959
Well, here's the reason some may wonder.

00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:59.620
In our midst today, Christian congregation,

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:06.720
what's going to happen when all the enlightened are taken to heaven?

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:12.120
Will the great crowd be left in the lurch?

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:17.819
Will they stray into some kind of trouble?

00:08:17.819 --> 00:08:21.160
Maybe even apostasy?

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:25.560
Well, what do you think?

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:30.860
Have you heard any signs of that already?

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.559
Well, here's the answer.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:38.460
No, they're not going to stray into apostasy.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.659
Absolutely not.

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:49.259
Those Bible accounts actually teach us what will not happen.

00:08:49.259 --> 00:08:52.659
And that brings us to the second question.

00:08:52.659 --> 00:08:58.860
How do we know that such things will not happen?

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:06.820
The answer has a lot to do with when we live.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:13.889
We do not live in ancient Israel.

00:09:13.889 --> 00:09:21.330
I don't see anyone dressed like an Israelite.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:25.330
None of you brothers wear skirts.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:29.529
Oh, there's one in all there's none.

00:09:29.529 --> 00:09:35.700
So we didn't live in ancient Israel.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.799
Well, now you may wonder, why does that matter?

00:09:38.799 --> 00:09:46.230
Because that nation was heading for trouble from its early days.

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:50.730
In Deuteronomy, chapter 31, verse 29.

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:58.529
Moses uttered this inspired prophecy about those rebellious people.

00:09:58.529 --> 00:10:00.830
This is what it re-hout reads.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:05.929
I will know that after my death, you will surely act wickedly

00:10:06.029 --> 00:10:11.330
and turn aside from the way about which I have commanded you.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:16.129
Now Moses' words came true many times, not just once.

00:10:16.129 --> 00:10:20.029
Finally, Jehovah had to cast off those wicked people.

00:10:20.029 --> 00:10:24.529
So when King Jehovah went bad,

00:10:24.529 --> 00:10:30.429
he was just acting like many other kings of Judah and Israel.

00:10:30.429 --> 00:10:34.230
Today things are different among God's people.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:40.029
Keep in mind we do not live at the end of the first century CE.

00:10:40.029 --> 00:10:44.139
Now why does that matter?

00:10:44.139 --> 00:10:50.639
Remember in Matthew 13, when his illustration of the wheat and the weeds,

00:10:50.639 --> 00:10:55.240
Jesus had foretold that a great apostasy would take place.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:11:00.139
In 2 Thessalonians, chapter 2, Paul confirmed that Jesus' prophecy

00:11:00.139 --> 00:11:06.539
was already beginning to come true in the first century.

00:11:06.539 --> 00:11:10.440
Peter and John verified the same in their writings.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:16.740
In the 2ndth century CE, the Christian congregation was corrected

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:22.039
and went off into spiritual captivity to Babylon the Great.

00:11:22.039 --> 00:11:26.539
So Jesus' inspired prophecy was fulfilled.

00:11:26.539 --> 00:11:29.039
It came true.

00:11:29.039 --> 00:11:33.840
However today things are very different among God's people,

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.740
much different.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:39.240
At what time are we living?

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.039
Well, we said not back then.

00:11:42.039 --> 00:11:43.940
Well, you know the answer to that.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:50.039
We're blessed to be living in a special time period.

00:11:50.039 --> 00:11:54.440
And this began far back as 1914.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:12:02.360
It's more than just the last days of this old system of things.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.360
Well, why is that?

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:09.960
Notice what the Bible says, Acts chapter 3, verse 21.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:17.259
It says it's also called the times of restoration of all things.

00:12:17.259 --> 00:12:22.059
Now let the word restoration linger in your mind.

00:12:22.059 --> 00:12:24.860
Why does that matter?

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:29.360
We're living in a times of restoration of all things.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:34.059
Because pure worship has been restored.

00:12:34.059 --> 00:12:36.460
We're bathing in it.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:43.659
And the worship of Jehovah will never be corrupted ever again

00:12:43.659 --> 00:12:47.059
for all eternity.

00:12:47.059 --> 00:12:54.259
Now that is something to swallow that's tasty indeed.

00:12:54.259 --> 00:12:59.259
Now let's read Isaiah 54, 17 together.

00:12:59.259 --> 00:13:04.159
Jehovah made this long range prophecy through Isaiah.

00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:06.559
Now this is what it says.

00:13:06.559 --> 00:13:09.960
No weapon formed against you will have any success.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:14.759
And you will condemn any tongue that rises up against you in the judgment.

00:13:14.759 --> 00:13:20.159
This is the heritage of the servants of Jehovah.

00:13:20.159 --> 00:13:23.159
And their righteousness is from me.

00:13:23.159 --> 00:13:25.460
Declare Jehovah.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:28.259
Now think about that, please.

00:13:28.259 --> 00:13:37.659
No weapon formed against you will have any success.

00:13:37.659 --> 00:13:42.460
The prophecy says that this is our heritage.

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:48.460
Those inspired words are being fulfilled now today.

00:13:48.559 --> 00:13:51.360
Nothing can take that away,

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.259
not even the God of this system of things,

00:13:55.259 --> 00:13:58.159
Satan himself.

00:13:58.159 --> 00:14:01.460
Now remember our second question.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:05.759
How do we know that when the anointed are taken to heaven,

00:14:05.759 --> 00:14:09.960
the great crowd won't drift away into trouble?

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:16.559
How do we know that they won't rebel the way Jehovah did

00:14:16.559 --> 00:14:21.559
when Jehovah died or drift off into apostasy?

00:14:21.559 --> 00:14:28.559
The way the second century Christians did after the last of the apostles died off.

00:14:28.559 --> 00:14:41.559
Well, we know it just a matter of turning the page.

00:14:41.559 --> 00:14:50.929
And the answer is because we do not live in ancient Israel

00:14:50.929 --> 00:14:56.929
and we do not live in the second century CE.

00:14:56.929 --> 00:15:01.929
We live in a wonderful time of what?

00:15:01.929 --> 00:15:14.649
Restoration when Jehovah has guaranteed us that no weapon formed against us will succeed.

00:15:14.649 --> 00:15:16.649
Now our third question.

00:15:16.649 --> 00:15:21.350
What will happen when the anointed are taken to heaven?

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:24.850
Well, try to imagine that time.

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.850
Give you a second. It's over.

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:30.850
The great tribulation is underway.

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:32.850
Babel on the Great, the world empire,

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:35.850
false religion is destroying first.

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:36.850
Think of it.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:43.850
Events that God's organization has prepared us for over many decades

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:47.850
are happening before our eyes.

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:53.850
Then comes something else we have been told to expect.

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:55.850
What's that?

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:58.850
Sometime during the Great Tribulation,

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:00.850
and before the war of Armageddon,

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:05.850
the remaining ones of Christ's anointed are taken to heaven.

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:08.850
What do you think will happen next?

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:15.860
Will the great crowd wander about lost and confused

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.860
like sheep without a shepherd?

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.860
Of course not.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:23.860
Remember Jesus is the shepherd.

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:28.860
He will never fail to do his job.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:34.860
Keep in mind that the anointed are not the head of our organization.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:39.840
Jesus is.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:49.629
And we hope all parents today raising children will teach them that fact.

00:16:49.629 --> 00:16:55.629
With Jehovah's own son in charge, Christ followers here on earth will have nothing to fear.

00:16:55.629 --> 00:17:02.629
Of course, we do not know every detail about how Christ will lead his people at that time.

00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:08.630
But there are some Bible examples that may reassure us.

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:12.630
For instance, when Moses died before Israel entered the Promised Land,

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:15.630
what happened to God's people?

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:20.359
Well, without that faithful man,

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:22.359
were they left in the lurch?

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:25.359
The answer is no, not at all.

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:28.359
As long as they were Jehovah's people,

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:30.359
Jehovah provided for them.

00:17:30.359 --> 00:17:33.359
And he provided richly for them.

00:17:33.359 --> 00:17:35.359
They had an abundance.

00:17:35.359 --> 00:17:42.359
Before Moses died, Jehovah told him to commission Joshua to lead the people.

00:17:42.359 --> 00:17:46.359
Moses had been training Joshua for decades.

00:17:46.359 --> 00:17:49.359
In addition, there were many other capable men taking the lead,

00:17:49.359 --> 00:17:53.359
chiefs of thousands, 150s, and even tens.

00:17:53.359 --> 00:17:56.359
God's people were well cared for.

00:17:56.359 --> 00:18:01.609
Thank God for Moses and Joshua.

00:18:01.609 --> 00:18:04.609
Another example is that of Elijah.

00:18:04.609 --> 00:18:09.609
He had been taking the lead and peer worship among the Israelites for decades.

00:18:09.609 --> 00:18:16.609
But the time came for Jehovah to transfer him to a different assignment down south in Judah.

00:18:16.609 --> 00:18:23.609
Where faithful people in the Ten Tribe Kingdom of Israel left in the lurch, far from it.

00:18:23.609 --> 00:18:28.609
Elijah had been training Elisha for years.

00:18:28.609 --> 00:18:31.609
Then there were also the sons of the prophets,

00:18:31.609 --> 00:18:34.609
evidently organized into schools of some kind.

00:18:34.609 --> 00:18:36.609
We don't know.

00:18:36.609 --> 00:18:42.609
So there were many faithful men helping to lead God's people.

00:18:42.609 --> 00:18:46.609
Jehovah's purpose kept advancing, and he cared for his faithful people.

00:18:46.609 --> 00:18:53.609
Now with those examples in mind, what do you think will happen when they allointed or taken to heaven?

00:18:53.609 --> 00:18:56.609
Well, we don't need to wonder.

00:18:56.609 --> 00:19:03.529
Open your Bibles and page and look at Hebrews 13.

00:19:03.529 --> 00:19:06.529
5B.

00:19:06.529 --> 00:19:11.529
It says, for he has said, I will never leave you, and I will never abandon you.

00:19:11.529 --> 00:19:22.349
That tells us the simple reassuring truth, Jehovah will never abandon his faithful ones.

00:19:22.349 --> 00:19:31.349
Like Moses and Elijah and faithful anointed ones who take the lead today, understand the importance of training others.

00:19:31.349 --> 00:19:33.349
That's undergoing.

00:19:33.349 --> 00:19:39.349
The governing body has been training men of the other sheep to take the lead for many decades now.

00:19:39.349 --> 00:19:47.349
We're familiar with the many schools to train elders and missionaries and traveling overseers and branch personnel.

00:19:47.349 --> 00:19:54.349
In addition to that, the governing body has personally been training helpers to the various committees of the governing body.

00:19:54.349 --> 00:20:00.349
These faithful men are right now carrying a very heavy load of responsibility.

00:20:00.349 --> 00:20:06.349
Believe me, as a member of the governing body, I can say for the rest of us,

00:20:06.349 --> 00:20:12.349
we need the helpers that Jehovah has given us.

00:20:12.349 --> 00:20:15.349
We pray for them every day.

00:20:15.349 --> 00:20:25.349
And they're well prepared to continue in this work, carrying for Christ sheep under the direction of Jesus himself, the head of the congregation.

00:20:25.349 --> 00:20:35.349
Now, what is the point, simply this, when the anointed are taken to heaven near the very end of the great tribulation, but before Armageddon,

00:20:35.349 --> 00:20:39.349
there will be no interruption of pure worship here on the earth.

00:20:39.349 --> 00:20:43.349
Pure worship will keep right on going.

00:20:43.349 --> 00:20:50.759
So thank you, Jehovah, for the leadership of Jesus Christ.

00:20:50.759 --> 00:20:58.170
None of God's worshipers in heaven are on earth will miss a beat.

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:03.170
Yes, there will be an attack from God of may God, but it will not get very far.

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:15.170
It's going to fail. It will not stop the great crowd from worshiping Jehovah and looking to him to rescue them and what a rescuer he will prove to be.

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:19.170
Now, how we answered a third question? Well, partly.

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:26.170
We know what will happen to the great crowd when the anointed are taken to heaven, but that may still leave us wondering.

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:28.170
What about the anointed?

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:33.170
What will they do after they depart the earthly scene?

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:44.480
We want to know. Well, the Bible answers that directly.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:56.480
At Revelation 17, we are able to learn in verse 14 that the political elements of this world will foolishly battle with the Lamb.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:02.480
They will lose, of course. The verse says the Lamb will conquer them.

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:06.480
And who will help him? The verse continues.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:11.480
Also those with him who are called and chosen and faithful will do so.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:15.480
Now who are called chosen and faithful?

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.480
At that time it will be the resurrected anointed.

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:25.480
So when the anointed are called to heaven, one of the first assignments is to fight.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:31.720
Yeah. Now that's interesting.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:36.720
Some of us were fighters before we became through Christians.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:43.250
Some even served in various branches of the military.

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:45.250
Did receive.

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:54.440
Brother Morris. Some were green berets, not brother Morris.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:23:04.890
But then we became Christians. We learned the way of peace and we let go of such warfare.

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:17.890
Figuratively speaking, we pulled the pin on our last hand grenade and tossed it into the air, killing no one or nothing.

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:23.200
Just a loud call. Boom.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:31.200
But in heaven, we will serve along with Christ and His holy angels, waging the final war against God's enemies.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:38.200
So if you've ever thought that you might feel left in the lurch after the anointed are taken to heaven, think of this.

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:42.200
Honor, none of us Christians are allowed to fight.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:49.200
Many of us anointed ones are too old to fight, even if we were allowed to.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:58.200
But in heaven, we will be mighty spirit creatures fighting alongside our warrior king, Jesus Christ.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:13.200
Believe me, we can and will do use significant more good in heaven than we ever could as imperfect humans here on this earth.

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:35.900
Well, I'm not done, but I should be.

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.900
Ask for the other sheet.

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:42.900
What will you need to do during that climatic time?

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.900
Simply this. Hide.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:53.900
That's right. At Isaiah 26, 20, he wrote, inner your inner rooms and shut your door behind you.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:58.900
Hide yourself for a brief moment until the wrath has passed by.

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:07.900
It will be hide and seek. You will hide and they will seek to find you, but they will not.

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.900
Do you have anything to worry about?

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.900
You have nothing to worry about.

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.900
Nothing at all.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:21.900
Because Jehovah will never abandon you.

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:26.900
There is no justifiable reason to worry about the future.

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:30.900
Just be there, brothers and sisters, to enjoy it.

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:35.900
Remember, Jehovah loves you and he will never abandon you.

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:41.900
Please believe it. You will not be disappointed.
