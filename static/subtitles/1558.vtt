00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:47.960
I promised to kill I'd go out and service with him after school, and I kept my word, but my head just wasn't in it.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:59.979
A kill could tell, so he tried to see if everything was okay.

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:08.319
Honestly, at the time, I would have rather been playing video games, but I couldn't tell him that.

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:17.500
I mean, he's a pioneer. I'm an hysterial servant. He wouldn't understand.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:43.870
Later that week, a kill invited me to go mountain biking with some friends.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.870
It was actually really fun.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:02:02.269
So then, you're obviously good at biking. What else do you like to do for fun?

00:02:02.269 --> 00:02:14.710
Soon, I was showing him my video games, and surprisingly, he liked video games too.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.219
But he said he chose to be selective.

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:25.500
He began to describe the gladiators in ancient Rome.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:38.219
People would come from all over to watch them fight to the death.

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:44.219
And while the spectators weren't in any physical danger, the real danger came over time.

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:59.300
Repeatedly watching the blood shed and the killing, it was dulling their senses.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:10.169
And they wanted more of it. It was a big test for the Christians who lived back then.

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:19.710
A kill helped me to reason on the scripture at Romans 12, verse 9.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:26.500
A poor, what is wicked, cling to what is good.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:33.500
So Danny, the games may have changed over time, but the violence is still the same.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.500
I like video games, but I avoid the ones that promote what Jehovah hates.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:04:01.949
Jehovah's people can still have fun, and yeah, we can even play video games.

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:04.949
I just want to make wise choices.

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:20.329
I want to show Jehovah that I hate wickedness, and make his heart glad.
