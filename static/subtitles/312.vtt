word. Devastating effects. The Bible says, a mild answer turns away

00:00:50.320 --> 00:01:00.729
rage, but a harsh word stirs up anger. The way out of a crisis is only found

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:15.700
by learning to speak openly with one another. In a mild, gentle way, it takes time

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:29.439
and patience. Honestly apologizing also helps to build bridges. The insight of a

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:41.079
man certainly slows down his anger says the Bible. Insight means understanding to

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:47.640
have empathy for my partner. How can I understand the feelings behind their

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:56.670
reaction? How were my words understood? Speaking so as not to hurt one another's

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:10.479
feelings will help. When was everything okay between us? What were the things

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:29.219
that made us happy? Can we revive this love again? New direction?
