00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:05.389
My childhood was not easy.

00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:07.389
Actually it was a hard one.

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:10.390
All my life I thought and dreamed,

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.390
why can't all of us live free?

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.390
You're not allowed to express your opinion or to go where you want.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.390
The Jewish can, but you are not allowed because you are an Arab.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.390
I felt angry because of the injustice and animosity.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.390
So I started to say to myself,

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.390
I want to take action, I want to push the Jews away.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.390
So I became the leader of a cell that was opposed to the occupation.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.390
Because of this, I was imprisoned from 1985 for four years.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.390
Why?

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.390
I had this question on my mind all the time.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.390
Why? Why?

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.390
Then something happened that changed my whole life.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.390
The subscription to the Watchtower magazine was made for me.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.390
This is what I had been looking for.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.390
Peace, security, happiness and satisfaction.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.390
These things had been missing since my childhood.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.390
I looked and found them in the truth.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.390
Nothing will stop the bloodshed on the earth.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.390
Nothing but the kingdom.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.390
I maintain my relationship with Jehovah

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.390
and hold on to what I learned.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:33.640
This changed me.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.950
I was raised as a Jew.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.950
We are taught from childhood that we are the chosen nation

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.969
that got support of this nation.

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:50.969
But I lived.

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:55.969
I was surrounded by people who hated Arabs.

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:03.439
I remembered people saying the expression that a good Arab is a dead Arab.

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:10.439
There was a saying, if someone comes to kill you, kill him first.

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:17.439
They used to claim that this was a quote from the Bible.

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:24.439
When I learned the truth, all the barriers between us fell down.

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:28.439
For me, this was something that was very refreshing

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:32.439
to know that Jehovah expects us to love everyone.

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:36.439
People from all backgrounds, including Arabs.

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:40.439
Today, I am happy to be in Jehovah's Army

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:43.439
where millions of people belong to Jehovah's Army

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.439
and they don't serve to fight other people.

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.439
They serve him to save other people's lives

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:54.439
from all the nations and from all sorts of backgrounds.
