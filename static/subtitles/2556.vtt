The city's in devastation, it's in chaos, bridges have collapsed, many houses on the edge of the river were swept away.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.350
Our main concern was the health of our brothers, their well-being.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:37.350
We got in contact with some of the local elders who reassured us everyone was safe.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.350
So, immediately, we started getting in contact with brothers from the circuit,

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.350
and in a few hours, almost one and a half tons of food was received at the support center.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:01:02.850
We had an experience with an older lady because she had seen so many people in our house cleaning up.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.849
She asked us, why are there so many people at your house?

00:01:06.849 --> 00:01:08.849
Did they all live in your house?

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:11.849
No, their brothers and sisters from our congregation.

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:13.849
Were Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:21.849
Ah, but nobody came from my church to help me, not even to assist me to get out of the house and certainly not to clean up my house.

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:25.849
So we really see what a privilege it is to have our brotherhood.

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:32.849
Even though our cities in this state, we as Jehovah's people are together and united and we're all right.

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:36.849
Without a doubt, Jehovah is helping us and he's with us.
