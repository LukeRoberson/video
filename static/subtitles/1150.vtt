00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.830
What's your favorite animal?

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.750
My favorite animal is the dolphin.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.189
One time I was snorkeling in the ocean, and a pot of dolphins came by, and of course with

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:19.589
the mask on I could see underwater, and it was beautiful to watch how they could swim,

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:21.989
how sleek they were in the water.

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:26.190
Then I watched as one of them used his powerful tail to shoot up to the surface of the water,

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.030
I lifted my head up and watched him jump out of the water and gracefully go right back

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.030
in.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.750
That was a sight I won't forget.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.549
I'm sure that if we talk to each of you watching this, you could tell some really good story

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:43.469
about your favorite animal.

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.350
Our beautiful planet Earth is full of animals.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.390
Of course though, for many of us in modern day life, we don't get a chance to interact

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.429
with animals that much.

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:58.509
Most of our interaction with animals is second hand through books or videos.

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:04.150
In fact, the internet is full of videos, especially of cats.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.750
People share these videos why, because it makes them smile.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.590
They enjoy watching them.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.189
In fact, many of you are probably thinking of some video you just watched about animals.

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:25.269
Clearly Jehovah created animals with qualities to bring us joy, to make us happy.

00:01:25.269 --> 00:01:30.150
Seeing them in person or in videos can cultivate our interest.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.189
They can entertain us and make us feel good.

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.989
We see Jehovah's sense of humor and how the animals interact and play with one another.

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:43.750
And we can also learn lessons from the animals.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.349
Proverbs 6 and 6 is an example of that.

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:51.349
Proverbs 6 and 6.

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:57.030
Go to the ant, you lazy one, observe its ways and become wise.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.790
Now I can remember as a young boy, I was fascinated with ants.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.829
So many of them, and yet they all knew what to do.

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.310
And they could carry these really big leaves and other things for their size.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.389
It was amazing to see what they could do, even the building of their tunnels.

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:19.389
As children, many of us were interested in animals, fascinated with them.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:26.830
However, as we got older, we became more fascinated with technology, or things that man has made.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:34.949
But really, the things that man has made cannot compare to the things Jehovah has made, especially the animals.

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:44.590
The design and wonder, you feel when you watch your favorite animal, is it in a category all by itself.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.469
Now in the following video, we're going to see some really beautiful animals.

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:56.370
Maybe you will see your favorite animal.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.289
Animals fascinate us.

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:14.340
We marvel at their speed, their agility, and their strength.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:21.569
Their beauty and behavior are a pleasure to watch.

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:28.240
Like us, they play.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:35.919
Some even dance.

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:40.580
They are industrious.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.219
A beaver, then, can extend hundreds of meters.

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:48.539
Some can even be seen from space.

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:56.780
When we observe animals, we learn more about the creator.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:03.419
Their instinctive wisdom reveals his wisdom.

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:08.259
He is caring and generous.

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:13.520
And he is a happy God.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:20.189
Animals fascinate us because we are made in God's image.

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:28.430
We enjoy what he enjoys, especially our earth and its amazing animals.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.870
They are his gift to us.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.550
Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness,

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.790
and let them have in subjection the fish of the sea,

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.430
and the flying creatures of the heavens,

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:55.920
and the domestic animals, and all the earth.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.439
Were you and the others with you watching that video smiling,

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:05.199
or maybe even laughing a little bit when you saw the little dog jumping back and forth?

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:11.800
You see the design of animals to bring us joy is not an evolutionary accident.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.279
Jehovah and Jesus, his master worker,

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:21.240
found joy in creating and designing animal life to delight us.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:27.560
Now, can you imagine Jehovah and Jesus discussing designing an elephant?

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.120
The elephant trunk is a nose.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.800
It's an arm.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.800
It's a shower head.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.519
It's a straw, and can even be a snorkel.

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:44.120
Did you know that their feet are so well padded that you can hardly hear them coming?

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.120
Imagine, Jehovah and Jesus making this huge elephant and saying,

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.959
we're going to make it really quiet.

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:58.759
Or can you imagine what the angels thought when they first saw a lemur dancing?

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:02.759
Or a hummingbird hovering in the air?

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:06.360
Or a little puppy chasing its tail?

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.000
Or can you imagine being Adam?

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.480
The first human being amongst all of these animals.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:19.660
How Adam must have thrilled to watch the animals and name them?

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:25.019
What would you have called an animal with a funny hump on its back?

00:06:25.019 --> 00:06:29.740
Or a bird that could mimic the sounds you made?

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.819
Or a lizard that could change colors?

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:37.740
Maybe even looking at it as it moved, changing colors, wondering,

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.319
how did it do that?

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:46.279
Jehovah assigned Adam to not only name the animals, but to care for them.

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:49.560
Let's read the scripture that was highlighted in our video

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:54.199
in Genesis 1 and verse 26.

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:58.120
Genesis 1 and verse 26.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:04.199
Since then God said, let us make man in our image according to our likeness

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:07.480
and let them have in subjection the fish of the sea

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.319
and the flying creatures of the heavens and the domestic animals

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:17.000
and all the earth and every creeping animal that is moving on the earth.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Yes, Jehovah God wanted Adam and his descendants, that's us,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.439
to take care of the animals and to take delight in them.

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:33.560
If we take time to enjoy animal life, we can make some very fascinating discoveries.

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:38.600
Did you see in the video the lemurs of Madagascar?

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.160
Do you know how many varieties of lemurs there are?

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.879
Do you know what lemurs eat?

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:48.920
Have you ever seen lemurs play?

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:54.839
I have and I guarantee you you will enjoy it and smile when you do.

00:07:54.839 --> 00:07:58.120
I made one discovery about dolphins.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:03.399
Dolphins can blow underwater a perfect circle of air

00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:07.160
and then they like to play with it afterwards.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:12.120
First time I saw that video, I couldn't hardly believe my eyes.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:18.920
Friends, today we can only imagine what it will be like in the future paradise

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:25.589
when we can really enjoy animal life the way Jehovah truly intended.

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:30.230
In review, this symposium has been about Jehovah's creative works,

00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:37.509
exquisite flowers, delicious food, beautiful colors,

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:44.549
our well-designed bodies, delightful sounds and fascinating animals,

00:08:44.549 --> 00:08:49.429
all of which convinces us that Jehovah wants us to enjoy life.

00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:56.950
At a time when many people are not finding meaning or joy in the things that man has made,

00:08:58.149 --> 00:09:04.149
observe and rejoice in the gift of the things that Jehovah has made and given to us.

00:09:05.029 --> 00:09:17.269
Make them a source of true joy in your life.
