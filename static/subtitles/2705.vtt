00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:09.699
I love my family very much.

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:14.179
Even though we don't have a lot, we're glad we have each other.

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:23.460
Mom works really hard to provide for us.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:35.289
It's just the four of us.

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:44.380
We've all been feeling just a little sad lately.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.539
I can tell she's really tired and worries a lot.

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:52.539
I try to help out.

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.219
Sometimes I help to get everyone ready for the meeting.

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:05.560
We seem to manage all right, but things are really hard.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:22.700
At our next family worship, Mom read to us 2 Corinthians 8.1 to 4.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.900
That story is about the Macedonians.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.980
Mom had us close our eyes so we can imagine the scene.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.420
Even though the Macedonians were very poor, they found happiness by giving what they

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.019
could to others.

00:01:39.019 --> 00:01:53.549
They even begged the apostles for the opportunity to give.

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.790
Then we read Acts 2035 where it says,

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:04.829
There is more happiness and giving than there is and receiving, like Sister said.

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.230
But we don't have anything to give.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.990
Mom said, but we do.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.990
We have ourselves.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.150
It got us all thinking.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:35.180
Mom had a great idea.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:03:05.979
We spent the rest of our family worship making special gifts for the friends and our congregation.

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:08.780
It was pretty amazing.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.819
Even though we don't have a lot materially, there is still so much we can give.

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:21.060
Like putting a little in the contribution box each week and helping to clean.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.740
And of course, sharing in the ministry is the very best way we can give to others.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:44.379
Now we are even closer as a family and we have learned that there truly is more happiness

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.979
and giving.
