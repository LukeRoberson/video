00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:08.900
Christmas was such a happy time for my family.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:17.039
I was happy because we could be together as a family.

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:30.489
In our community, there are many traditions related to Christmas.

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:48.219
Our whole family would go to church on Christmas Eve to worship Jesus.

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:56.780
My husband passed away when the children were still very young, and I felt very lonely.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.539
Our lives had completely changed, so I would pray to God.

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:10.219
And all I would say was, God, wherever you are, please help me to raise my children well.

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:16.540
If the witnesses come by again, this time I will listen to them.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.340
They answered all my questions using the Bible.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:29.299
I began to learn what the Bible says about Jesus' birth, and I found it difficult to grasp.

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:35.780
What I had always been taught wasn't what the Bible said.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.379
I liked having a clear understanding of why God sent Jesus to the earth.

00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:47.939
What He was sent to do, what He will do in the future, and the blessings He'll bring.

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.459
I realized that what I was studying was the truth.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.140
I stopped thinking of Jesus as a little baby.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.980
I was excited to learn what the Bible says Jesus will do for mankind.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.360
Like how He will resurrect the dead.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.960
A lot of people didn't like what I was learning.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:25.310
My parents came to my house, and they said they would kick me out of town if I didn't stop studying.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:36.379
But I decided that what I was learning from the Bible was more important.

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:46.629
I was able to teach my children about who Jesus is, and what He will do for the earth.

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:56.900
Many years have gone by since we gave up those Christmas traditions.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:04.180
I'm so pleased to see how my children are doing because of following Bible teachings.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.139
Now, I am truly happy.
