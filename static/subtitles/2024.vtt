00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:05.500
An introduction to the book of Nehemiah.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.740
Nehemiah was a faithful Jewish man who served in the Royal Persian Court of Shushan.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.589
He had the high-ranking position of cup-bearer to King Arduzirksis.

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:23.269
Sometime after 443 BCE, the book of Nehemiah was written in Jerusalem.

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:29.309
It begins by describing events that happened about 12 years after those in Ezra's account.

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:31.670
The book contains 13 chapters.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.869
The cover events that began in 456 BCE to sometime after 443 BCE.

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:44.990
However, the first 12 chapters focus on what took place just within the first year.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.869
The events in chapters 1 and 2 began to take place near the end of 456 BCE.

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:57.590
Men from Jerusalem told Nehemiah about the deplorable condition of the city's walls and gates.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.909
And Nehemiah prayed to God for direction.

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:06.590
In answer to Nehemiah's prayer, the Persian king sent him to Jerusalem as governor and granted

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.150
him permission to rebuild the walls.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.909
Upon arrival, Nehemiah inspected the city walls.

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.349
He then gathered the people and announced his mission with the words, let us rebuild

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:21.150
the walls of Jerusalem.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.829
The mission to rebuild Jerusalem marked the beginning of the 70 weeks of years mentioned

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:29.290
in Daniel's prophecy.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.689
At the end of 69 weeks of years, the Messiah would appear.

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:43.060
Chapters 3-6 recount the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls and gates despite enemy opposition.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.060
Did you know?

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:54.819
A large workforce of men and women repaired Jerusalem's walls in just 52 days.

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:59.939
Chapters 7-12 show how Nehemiah and Ezra took the lead in helping the people return

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.969
to true worship.

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.569
The people gathered to hear the law being read and explained.

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.530
Next, the eight-day festival of booze was held.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.129
After this, the walls of Jerusalem were inaugurated.

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:19.930
Nehemiah continued as governor of Jerusalem for 12 years before returning to his duties

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.689
under King Arduzirksis.

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:29.169
Chapter 13 tells us that Nehemiah traveled to Jerusalem a second time, only to find that

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:33.650
the Jews had not kept their promises to Jehovah.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.650
He then took decisive action to correct the situation.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.770
As you read this stirring account, notice how Jehovah used a Persian king to accomplish

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.729
his will.

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:50.770
Observe how Nehemiah zeal for a knowledge of God's law led to blessings.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.610
And note how the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls became a key to understanding an important

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.129
prophecy in Daniel that pointed to the appearance of the Messiah.
