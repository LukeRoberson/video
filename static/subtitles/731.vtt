00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:08.830
This has indeed been a unique class of Gilead at a most unique time in world events.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:16.469
The Bethel family is fully aware of what transpired, but since this program will be broadcast

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:24.620
to our global brotherhood, let me remind all of you of what transpired.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:31.420
You're well aware of the unique time in world events, a global pandemic.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.299
What makes this class so unique?

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:41.140
A normal class of Gilead consists of 50 some students.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.460
The 149th class is made up of just 25.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.859
Your class is abnormal, but why?

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:59.859
You know why, but let me share your experience with the world-wide brotherhood.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:04.219
Those who had been invited to attend this class of Gilead had begun to arrive at the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:07.500
Educational Center in Patterns in New York.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.379
The 25 students in this class actually arrived in mid-March of 2020.

00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:22.939
And as we all know, it was at that time that the coronavirus was declared to be a global

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.019
pandemic.

00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:27.540
Most travel was shut down.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.459
The rest of their classmate could not come.

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:40.349
Due to government restrictions on educational facilities, the 149th class had to be postponed.

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:45.790
You students were stuck at Patterns in New York with no classes in session.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:52.870
Commendably, many of you were able to work remotely for your home branch office in the

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.390
interim.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.030
Finally, here in New York, government agencies allowed for educational facilities to again

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.709
conduct classes if physical distancing could be maintained.

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:12.550
With just 25 of you, that was possible in the Gilead lecture hall.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:22.870
So we have only 25 abnormal students who will graduate today to clarify.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.509
It is the number of students that makes this class abnormal.

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:38.349
But I'm told by your instructors that individually, you are very normal.

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:45.110
In fact, they are very impressed with your spirituality and your Christian personalities.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.710
You have excelled in your studies and classroom participation.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:55.229
Students are delighted to be with you on this very special day.

00:02:55.229 --> 00:03:00.830
What else though makes this an abnormal Gilead graduation?

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.310
You were not able to invite family members and close friends to be here in person with

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.349
you for this exciting event.

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:15.629
However, the teaching committee made arrangements for you to tie in a number of these ones for

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:20.030
a streamed recording of the program.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:26.270
And the good news is that the entire program is being recorded and will be posted as a

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:33.550
future JW Broadcasting Monthly program in all of the approved languages.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.229
We have a few statistics to share about the 149th class.

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:47.310
Of the 25 students, eight or married couples, seven are single brothers, and there are two

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.430
single sisters in the class.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.460
I guess they're still single.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.060
All we're serving at a Bethel Branch Facility are at a regional translation office before

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.340
attending school.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:11.259
The students are from 14 different countries and speak 29 different languages.

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:13.500
Their average age is 41.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.219
That's a good age.

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:19.740
44 years ago, I was 41.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:24.220
Their average years and full-time service is 20.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:30.939
In the Bible, Gilead referred to a territory in Israel, and that name, Gilead, was derived

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:36.660
from a Hebrew word that meant witness heap.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:44.139
When the school was first inaugurated in 1943, Gilead was an appropriate name.

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:49.660
One of the instructors described the purpose of the school saying, it was to instill in the

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:56.420
students a more intense desire to share in the evangelizing world.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:02.939
And for decades, thousands of missionaries were sent out to open up new territories around

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:05.220
the world.

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:09.540
A heap of witness was given during that period of time.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:16.620
However, in 2011, the governing body adjusted this specific purpose of Gilead.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.540
Instead of focusing on opening up new territories for preaching, the purpose of the curriculum

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.699
changed.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:32.980
As we mentioned previously, this entire class was already serving at a Bethel Facility

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.259
or a regional translation office.

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:43.699
The goal of Gilead is now to bolster such ones so as to strengthen and stabilize God's

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:49.220
people in the respective territories to which they will be assigned.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.220
Then what about the all-important evangelizing work?

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:59.470
Who is assisting with the heap of witness where a white?

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.709
That's now the focus of the school for kingdom evangelizers.

00:06:04.709 --> 00:06:10.790
Each branch committee selects qualified pioneers who are willing to be transferred to another

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:16.110
part of the country that needs help with the preaching work.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:24.910
By using the large pool of zealous local pioneers, the heap of witness is still being given

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.589
where the need is great.

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:33.269
These local ones are already adapted to the culture, climate, and living conditions in

00:06:33.269 --> 00:06:38.750
their countries, and oftentimes they already know the language where there is the greatest

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:39.750
need.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:48.550
However, the 25 of you in this class of Gilead are expected to strengthen and stabilize

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.110
God's people where you are assigned.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.310
Well, what does that entail?

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:03.230
For you brothers, in time it may mean you will be given more responsibility.

00:07:03.269 --> 00:07:09.949
But your training has given you another way to stabilize fellow believers in your assignment.

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:16.189
And this applies to all 25 of you whether brothers or sisters.

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:20.350
You've been elevated while here at the Gilead.

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:29.110
In fact, in the territory of Gilead in the Bible, the elevation changes dramatically.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:38.629
In the Jordan Valley, Gilead was 690 feet, 210 meters, below sea level.

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:45.110
But traveling east to the dome like mountainous region of Gilead, the elevation rises to

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:52.910
over 3,300 feet or 1,000 meters.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:57.509
New students came to Gilead, below sea level.

00:07:57.509 --> 00:08:04.509
But with daily Bible study and lectures, you have been elevated.

00:08:04.509 --> 00:08:09.069
Throughout the past 5 months, your faith has grown.

00:08:09.069 --> 00:08:12.670
Your spirituality has been enhanced.

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:16.670
Your Christian personality has been refined.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:19.670
You have been elevated.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:27.149
You will be going out to your assignment, not so much for a heap of witness, but as a heap

00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:29.550
of example.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:37.950
In this way, you will strengthen and stabilize those you work with at the branch and those

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:44.419
you associate with in your congregations.

00:08:44.419 --> 00:08:55.299
Find a Deuteronomy 8, verses 17 and 18.

00:08:55.299 --> 00:09:02.779
Never forget that your power and strength, your spiritual wealth, does not originate with

00:09:02.779 --> 00:09:04.100
you.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:10.220
It is Jehovah who has made this transformation in you.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:16.350
Read with me Deuteronomy 8, 17 and 18.

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:23.029
If you should say in your heart, my own power and the strength of my own hand have produced

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:25.190
this wealth for me.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:32.230
Remember that it is Jehovah your God who gives power to you to make well.

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:41.639
In order to carry out his covenant that he swore to your forefathers as it is today.

00:09:41.639 --> 00:09:49.000
Today you will graduate from the 149th class of Gilead, but you will strengthen and stabilize

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:57.519
those in your assignment if you remember that it is Jehovah your God who gives power

00:09:57.519 --> 00:09:58.720
to you.
