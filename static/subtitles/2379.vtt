00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:24.179
Birdsong, of the more than 10,000 different species of birds, nearly half are classified

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:25.260
as songbirds.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.989
They certainly live up to their name.

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:39.460
They may sing to attract a mate, or to defend their territory.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:47.259
Before sunrise, many songbirds join in a robust display of singing, known as the dawn chorus.

00:00:47.259 --> 00:01:02.310
From the delicate tones of the musician-ren, to the long and varied melodies of the night

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.670
and gale.

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:09.390
Birdsong can be remarkably complex.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.349
Each song is a well-structured composition.

00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:15.549
At times performed with incredible consistency.

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:21.189
Scientists analyze birdsong by creating spectrograms, which provide a visual representation

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:22.989
of the sounds.

00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:27.750
Slowing down a recorded birdsong makes it possible to hear the individual notes that

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:47.730
make up each rapid-fire burst of song.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.849
Birdsong using a vocal organ found nowhere else in the animal kingdom.

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:54.730
The Syrinks.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:00.209
An intricate system of muscles and cartilage operate the Syrinks and are used, along with

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:08.330
the neck and bill, to generate a stunning range of sounds, such as whistles, trills,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.229
buzzes, and chirps.

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:19.389
Unlike the voice box in humans and in some animals, which has a single chamber for producing

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:24.949
sound, the Syrinks has two separate chambers that work independently.

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:29.949
Using these chambers, some birds, such as the woodthrush, can produce two different

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:38.509
notes at the same time, essentially singing a duet, all on their own.

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:43.469
All of this complex vocal equipment requires a brain that can control it.

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:48.150
And the songbird brain is made for singing, with circuitry for controlling the Syrinks

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:57.639
and the Respiratory system, and another circuit dedicated to learning songs.

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:03.319
It's important because all songbirds that have been studied learn songs over time.

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.319
Primarily during their first few weeks of life, they memorize the songs unique to their

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.280
species and neighborhood.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.280
As they get older, they practice until their rendition matches the one they've learned

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.719
from other birds.

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:20.879
Some birds learn not just one song, but a whole repertoire.

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:26.280
For example, the brown pressure can sing 2,000 different types of songs.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.280
Each one uniquely structured.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.680
Some birds even remix existing songs to perform one of a kind melodies.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.159
This ability to improvise completely new songs is just one aspect of bird song that scientists

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:44.039
are still striving to understand.

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:49.879
The next time you hear a bird welcome the day with song, ask yourself, did the complex

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:54.120
vocal organ and singing ability of songbirds evolve?

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.960
Or was it designed?
