00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:07.639
The Australia branch has recently undergone a name change that more accurately reflects

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:10.119
its scope of activity.

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:16.420
Since January 1st of this year, it has been known as the Australasia branch.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.699
This is fitting since countries such as New Zealand, Samoa, Tonga, the Cook Islands, New

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.660
Way, Tokalao and Timor Lester are all working under that branch.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:35.219
In its formation in 1904, the Australasia branch was responsible for all the countries

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.299
stretching from Tahiti all the way to India.

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:46.140
It truly was Australasia that name incorporating the Latin word for South.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.659
Over the years, many new branches were formed in this area, some of which have recently

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:56.259
been merged again as if returning to their roots.

00:00:56.259 --> 00:01:02.280
There are 1,06 congregations throughout Australasia, which is just over 83,000 publishers

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.599
serving there of these 6,766 are in full-time service.

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:14.439
And with our August report, I was pleased just to hear yesterday that Australia itself

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:21.280
had a new peak, an all-time peak of 68,635 in August.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.120
As elsewhere, there has been a very fine response throughout the branch to the invitation

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.599
to attend the Bible School for Christian Couples and the Bible School for Single Brothers.

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:37.200
These schools, of course, now merging into the School for Kingdom of Angelizers.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.000
Many graduates are serving in isolated areas throughout the branch territory.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.760
Some of them are in foreign language congregations and groups.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.640
Many people have come to Australia in recent years from Hong Kong and China, and they are

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.000
hearing the Bible message.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.870
Some remain in Australia after their time there, others they return home with the truth.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.349
Imelda was born in Sumatra, Indonesia, of Chinese descent.

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.550
She attended a Catholic school and was baptized as a Catholic, though she said she only did

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.949
so to police her friends.

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:22.270
Many years later, as a widow, she migrated to Australia this in 1992, there she attended

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.150
a Protestant church, and she was involved with a Texas-based Bible Study Fellowship that

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.069
used to hold weekly discussions and discuss Bible verses.

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.909
A sister met Imelda in the door-to-door work and considered the truth tracked with her.

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:42.990
For some time, she remained a magazine call, but then a Bible study was started.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.430
The first time she came to the Kingdom Hall, she was so impressed with what she saw.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.870
She saw that all those at the hall were like a big family, the members of which showed

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.550
love for one another, talking to one another after the meeting.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.189
She contrasted this with what she noted at her church, where everyone quickly left after

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.270
hearing the sermon.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.509
She continued her Bible study, but also attended the Protestant church.

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:14.069
Both of these activities, her minister said, well, that's fine, just keep going.

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.909
After learning what the Bible says about the Trinity, though, she queried her minister,

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:21.750
and his reply was, just listen and learn.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.430
A turning point, though, came for her when the minister finished his sermon early one

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.750
day, saying that he had to attend a festival called the Madigra.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.629
Now, in Sydney, this is well known for its association with the so-called alternate

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:39.629
lifestyles.

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:44.349
A Melda then saw the difference between what she was learning from God's Word and the

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:49.789
actions of church members, and she decided she wanted to serve God in truth, and she

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:54.189
wanted to be part of a family-like congregation.

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:58.110
When she handed in her resignation from the church, the minister told her to keep it.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.629
You may need it, he said.

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.909
However, she firmly told him, no, I'm not going to need it.

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:10.789
Not the opposition that followed, at the age of 89, she was baptized on March 15 this

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:13.580
year.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.779
Early one morning while caring for a literature cut, a sister noticed a Chinese lady looking

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:24.019
through the English magazines at the bottom of the cut.

00:04:24.019 --> 00:04:27.339
The lady chose one, but she still lingered there.

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:32.139
So the sister approached her, and her had a little talk with her.

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.660
She said to the lady, you may take whatever you would like.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.259
The lady said that she would like a Bible story book, and so the sister was happy to provide

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:44.259
one for and said it would be there the next week.

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:50.680
The lady provided her with her mobile phone number, sorry, cell number.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.360
The following week she happily collected her Bible story book, and the sister took the

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.759
opportunity then to show her the website, particularly pointing out the information

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:03.879
available and beneficial for families and for children.

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:08.439
The lady provided her address, and then the sister was able to call on her and start

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:11.680
a study in the good news brochure.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.879
At the time the sister first called at her home, the lady excitedly told the sister of

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:21.199
all the good things that she'd seen on the website that she'd looked up, and she'd love

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.519
to read it.

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:26.879
And she said that she'd been in touch with her husband in China about a two, and he was

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:32.240
just as excited, and he agreed that everything on the website was very good.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.639
He told her, please tell me everything that you were learning about the Bible.

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:42.560
Well, two weeks after this was the memorial which she attended, paying close attention

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.759
to what was presented, to ask many questions, so the sister thought, well, I'll invite

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:50.000
her to come to Bethel, which she did.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.839
She toured there and was impressed.

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:57.240
The following week she attended the special talk, and then another two weeks past and

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.040
she attended a special assembly day in the Mandarin language.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:07.639
This lady is a microbiologist, and now she looks at things differently at what she's

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:13.240
the things that she's working with, and she thanks Jehovah for the beauty that she sees.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.959
In her words, I thank Jehovah for my coming to Australia to learn about him, because

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:22.279
the Bible is so restricted in my country.

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:27.000
She regularly attends all the meetings, she's made plans to travel down to Melbourne for

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.879
the International Convention that's on just in a week or two's time.

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:38.040
Her desire is to get baptized before she returns to her country, and she's already started

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.680
a Bible study of her own with one of her work colleagues.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:48.439
All those who serve at the branch in Australasia are happy to send their warmest love and greetings

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:50.720
as we work along with you in Kingdom interests.
