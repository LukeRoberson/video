00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.809
Isaiah, being God's prophet for some 46 turbulent years, it's amazing what he saw.

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:13.689
The spiritual condition of that nation was deplorable, but Isaiah never gave up in wanting

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:15.689
to help his people.

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:21.210
Must have broke his heart to see the 10 tribe kingdom of Israel destroyed by the Assyrians

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.690
in 740 BCE.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:31.050
But Isaiah said early in his career, he said that, here I am, send me, and he never turned

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.250
his back on that commission.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.850
Did Isaiah's words fall on deaf ears when he wanted to help once to walk in Jehovah's

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:38.850
Way?

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.049
This is the way, well, obviously not.

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:44.929
There were some that responded, though he might have thought his best years were behind

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:47.409
him, what about Hezekiah?

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:52.210
Hezekiah took those words seriously, began to put his heart into serving Jehovah God, had

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.570
a great influence on the nation.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.570
That was Hezekiah.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:02.969
And it must have made Isaiah's heart rejoice that his words were taken to heart by some

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.930
individuals like Hezekiah.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:13.650
But there are others that open our Bibles to 2 Chronicles 34, 2 Chronicles 34, and

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.730
note others that really put their heart into serving Jehovah God to say, this is the

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.209
way, walk in it.

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:24.010
Those words of Isaiah would resonate in the ears of some.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:32.170
For example, chapter 34, Josiah, 8 years old when he became king.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.969
He reigned for 31 years in Jerusalem.

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:39.370
Just a young boy, Josiah was, the year was 659.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.170
And here in verse 2 it says, he did what was right in Jehovah's eyes.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.209
He walked in the ways of David.

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:48.370
He didn't deviate to the right or to the left.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:54.530
Why did Josiah get this zeal to want to serve Jehovah even at a young age?

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.010
Wouldn't have been from his father, and his father, Amin, was wicked.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:05.849
But perhaps his grandfather, Manasseh, Manasseh died when Josiah was 6 years old.

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:10.930
So you can imagine now this repented Manasseh taking that little grand boy, putting him on

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.849
his knee, helping him to understand about Jehovah God.

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:21.569
To make the mistakes that I've made, he must have loved his grandpa, Josiah.

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:27.530
And at 6 years old, now he's 8 years old, and he starts to serve Jehovah with zeal,

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.449
appropriate for that age.

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:36.610
Now it's interesting that when Josiah was 8 years old in 659, a Nebuchadnezzar was about

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.289
5 years old.

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:41.569
So Josiah, he becomes this king full of compassion.

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.930
He loved people, Nebuchadnezzar, he becomes a king of cruelty, and actually does such

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.569
damage to the nation of Israel.

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:55.650
And of course, Josiah's son Zedakaya will end up blinding, Josiah.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.210
So different from others.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.379
Well, let's look at verse 3.

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:07.139
In the 8th year of his reign, that is Josiah, now he's 15 years old, he's still a boy,

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:11.939
he starts to search for the true God, and now in the 12th year of his reign he's even

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:19.060
cleansing Judah, he has a campaign against idolatry, and he's 19 years old, and he sweeps

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.180
through with zealot, 19 years old.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.139
This is the way, walk in it.

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:31.939
See, going back to that theme, this is the way, how happy, grateful Josiah must have

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:37.139
been when someone else comes to Jerusalem by the name of Jeremiah.

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:42.340
Jeremiah comes in about 648, 647, and they're about the same age.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.819
Josiah's 19, Jeremiah's in his early 20s, what a team, they become friends, they love each

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:55.580
other, and what a duo as they continue to help God's people walk in the way.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:04.580
Like a stereo system, both of them, look at verse 30, verse 31, and just picture what's

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:12.180
happening here in Jerusalem, with Josiah, with Jeremiah, verse 31, there's Josiah, helping

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.980
ones to keep God's commandments, reading the law that he found from the book of the law

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:25.779
in their ears, reading it, helping them to walk in the way, verse 31.

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:31.220
It says that Josiah would follow Jehovah, keep his commandments, his reminders, his regulations

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:37.740
with all his heart and with all his soul, carry out those words.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:44.139
You can just sense Jehovah's, Josiah's feelings are just bleeding through these pages, love

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:49.740
for Jehovah God, and wanting ones to walk in the way of Jehovah.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.500
So there you have Josiah, you have Jeremiah, it's wonderful to see.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:04.019
Now as the years roll on, would Josiah take note of a young Judean boy in the royal court

00:05:04.019 --> 00:05:09.180
by the name of Daniel? Daniel would have been young, but perhaps he put his eye on Daniel

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:15.459
and said, this boy, he has a bright future in Jehovah's service, we don't know.

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:22.220
And Josiah wouldn't live to see Daniel's accomplishments in due time, but it's interesting, still,

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:30.379
this is the way walk in it, individuals responded to that from Isaiah, it did not fall on deaf ears.

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:34.300
How do we know? Well, let's go a little bit further.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:45.019
Now the year is 617 BCE, and you have Daniel, you have Hanna Naya, Mishaya, Aziraya, Ezekiel,

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:48.620
all individuals that responded to Jehovah's word.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:55.220
And when you think about how they had to take the words of Isaiah, take the words of Jeremiah,

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.459
these boys, and really apply it to their life and under their circumstances, we're very

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:08.220
proud of them. For example, now Josiah is dead and his sons and grandson begin to reign.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:15.100
You have wicked kings. And from the boyhood of Daniel to his teens, he witnessed the

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.660
bad conduct at the nation's highest levels.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:27.899
Jehovah has 23 years old wicked, Jehovah came 25 years old wicked, Jehovah came 18 years old wicked,

00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:33.819
Zedakaia 21 years old wicked, bad kings, and these boys watching this.

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:39.100
Well, that's their names, Jehovah has, Jehovah came, Jehovah came, Zedakaia, but they have

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:47.819
nicknames, dumb, dumber, dumbest, and stupid. And yet Daniel, Daniel would not be influenced by

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:53.579
their bad conduct. It's amazing to imagine what these boys were able to do and how their faith

00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:59.819
remained intact. They walked in Jehovah's way. They resolved in their heart, especially Daniel,

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:13.019
to be loyal to Jehovah God. To what extent? Ezekiel 14, 14. Ezekiel 14 in verse 14 is amazing words

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:22.060
where Ezekiel, five years after Daniel comes to Babylon, Ezekiel writes these words. So Daniel

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:28.779
now is in his early 20s. Ezekiel is about 30 years old, like Daniel's older brother. You can

00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:34.139
imagine how proud Ezekiel would have been to write these words about Daniel. No jealousy. I love

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:40.939
that boy. It's like my little brother. And he says, if Noah and Daniel and Jehovah were here,

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:48.079
you see they would save themselves because of their righteous conduct. Daniel was amazing.

00:07:48.079 --> 00:07:54.399
To be sandwiched between Jehovah and Noah, it's such a young age. And that's the type of man

00:07:54.480 --> 00:08:01.310
we're talking about. Why do we bring it up? We bring it up because we have many Daniel,

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:08.670
Daniel-like brothers and sisters right in our Bethel family here, young brothers and sisters

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:14.829
who have determined in their heart to prove the devil a liar, to take advantage of their youth,

00:08:14.829 --> 00:08:20.910
to show Jehovah how loyal they want to be, the depth of their devotion. And we want to commend

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:29.310
these young brothers and sisters, Daniel-like ones, we cannot legislate love of God for you.

00:08:30.829 --> 00:08:37.710
We cannot legislate how you use your electronic devices. We cannot legislate what you watch

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:43.870
with television and movie. We cannot do that. We cannot tell you to put a firewall up for your

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:50.669
computer. You can get around all that. You're smart. Your firewall is your love for Jehovah God.

00:08:50.669 --> 00:08:56.750
Your depth of devotion for him. And that's what we're saying. Thank you for using your free will,

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:03.950
like Daniel, to honor Jehovah God. Keep it up. And what about our older ones? Daniel continued to

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:13.629
serve Jehovah up until about 100 years old. He never gave up. What helped him? His prayers to

00:09:13.629 --> 00:09:20.509
Jehovah God. Prayer was the bedrock of his faith. So older Daniel-like members of our family

00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:27.549
that have served Jehovah for decades. Your loyalty is so deeply appreciated. And it's your prayer

00:09:27.549 --> 00:09:31.789
that have caused you day in and day out, week in and week out, month in and month out,

00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:40.590
to continue to serve Jehovah. And just as Daniel and Isaiah and Jeremiah and Josiah had a positive

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:46.190
impact on the people of their day, let me reassure you, you older brothers and sisters,

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:53.710
your mature ones, your loyalty and determination to walk in Jehovah's way for decades has deeply

00:09:53.710 --> 00:10:00.429
influenced our Bethel family. Your determination never to betray your God has touched us personally.

00:10:00.429 --> 00:10:02.429
And for this we say thank you.
