00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:07.719
Welcome! This month's program will help us show love and respect in marriage.

00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:14.720
Here are a few highlights. Is your marriage drained because your spouse opposes the truth?

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.719
We'll see how Alexandru's love and patience promoted peace in his marriage

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:24.719
and ultimately moved his wife, Dharina, to serve Jehovah.

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:29.719
We'll learn how Claudius Johnson dealt with changing circumstances

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:36.719
and our new original song reminds us of the joys of marriage based on Bible principles.

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.719
This is JW Broadcasting for March 2021.

00:00:40.719 --> 00:01:06.500
Jehovah Design Marriage is a beautiful and rewarding relationship between a husband and a wife.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.500
When a husband and wife fulfill their God-given roles and they treat each other with love and respect,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.500
their marriage is a wonderful and intimate friendship.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:24.500
A marriage that has good patterns, shaped by Jehovah's principles, looks like this well-balanced family circle.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.500
But if a married couple over time has set bad patterns in how they deal with each other,

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.500
this is often the result. The life's going to be a bit rough for them.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.500
Let's consider what Jehovah says about the roles of husband and wife

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.500
and then discuss how love and respect are real keys to a happy marriage.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.500
So what roles did Jehovah give to the man and woman in marriage?

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.500
Well, Jehovah places the husband as head of the family.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.500
Ephesians 523 says a husband is head of his wife.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.500
So that means the husband makes final decisions for the family

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.500
and his decisions reflect his love for his wife, his children,

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.500
and his understanding of their spiritual, physical, and emotional needs.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:22.500
At 1 Corinthians 11 and verse 3, we get a sense, though, of how Jehovah feels about the husband's role.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.500
And as we read this together, I want you to imagine Jehovah saying to husbands,

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:33.500
yes, your head of the family, but I want you to know that the head of every man is the Christ

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.500
and in turn the head of a woman is the man.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.500
Sounds a lot like a father-in-law speaking to the groom.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:48.500
You can marry my daughter, but you better treat her good because you're responsible to me.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.500
Well, Jehovah is giving a very clear message for husbands.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.500
Jehovah will hold you accountable to him for how you treat your wife.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.500
It's something for us husbands to think about, isn't it?

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.500
Well, what about the role of a wife?

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.500
Jehovah assigned wives as a beloved partner to her husband.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.500
And as partners, they can discuss important family matters

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.500
and work together to make their marriage a success.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.500
Jehovah placed the woman under the headship of the man,

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.500
and as such, her role is to be in subjection to him.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.500
At Ephesians 5 and verse 22, it says,

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.500
Let wives be in subjection to their husbands as to the Lord.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.500
Subjection. Set a certain way, it almost sounds bad.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.500
You have to be in subjection.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.500
But is the subjection of a Christian wife to a Christian husband a bad thing? No.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.500
See, subjection as described in the Bible is not about being subservient.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.500
It's about her role in the marriage.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.500
Your partners, each with a beautiful role to fulfill.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.500
We could illustrate it with watching a couple ice skating.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.500
As they move gracefully across the ice,

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.500
Do you think to yourself, how come they never let her hold him over her head?

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.500
Well, no, you look at him, you look at her,

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.500
it's obvious who should hold who over their head.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.500
Well, just as we admire and respect a woman's role as an ice skating partner,

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.500
a husband deeply loves and appreciates his wife's role as his partner

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.500
as they work gracefully together to make their marriage a success.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.500
Well, now that we briefly reviewed the roles for husbands and wives,

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:42.500
let's read together a key scriptural principle at Ephesians 5 and verse 33

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:49.500
that shows how Jehovah wants husbands and wives to fulfill their roles in marriage.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.500
Ephesians 5 and verse 33.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.500
Each one of you must love his wife as he does himself.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.500
On the other hand, the wife should have deep respect for her husband.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.500
Well, the obvious message in the Scripture is that husbands should love their wives

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.500
and wives should respect their husbands.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:18.500
However, there's another way to look at the Scripture and learn something about husbands and wives.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.500
Jehovah God is telling us what each mate needs.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.500
Men need respect and women need love.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.500
Now, this is not to say that men don't need love and women don't need to be respected.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.500
However, it does mean that men tend to emphasize respect and status

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:43.500
and women often emphasize intimacy, connection, and love.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:52.500
This perfect principle can help us to understand why our husband or wife may act or feel a certain way.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.500
Now, this difference in emphasis affects many areas of married life.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:10.500
Let's consider three examples of how this powerful scriptural principle of love and respect can give us insight into how a husband and wife talk to each other,

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.500
how they solve problems, and how they act in the company of others.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.500
Let's consider our first example, how they talk to each other.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.500
Now, since a wife's emphasis is on being loved,

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:29.500
her conversations often stress friendship and connection when she talks to her husband.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:35.500
She's eager to share the details of her life with him and in this way become closer to him.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.500
She wants him in turn to share with her the details of his day in life.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:50.500
Husbands, your wife feels loved when you learn to communicate with her in a way that tells her you truly care about her.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.500
She places great emphasis on conversation and sharing her life with you,

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.500
and likewise you sharing your life with her.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:05.500
For example, a wife tells her husband about something that happened to her that day.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:12.500
He grows impatient with the story and interrupts or changes the subject or offers a quick solution.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.500
How does she feel?

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:20.500
Why can't he listen to the whole story? Has he lost interest in me?

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:26.500
It's important that husbands give their wives their full attention as they speak.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.500
After a long day at work, his mind may be focused on events that happen to him that day,

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:40.500
and he may, without realizing it, feel that the events or conversation of his wife aren't on important subjects.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:46.500
So he may be inclined to play down the events in her life as unimportant or trivial,

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:52.500
while events he talks about are substantial and important because they happen to him.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.500
Well, such a feeling over time can truly discourage a wife.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:05.500
A husband's disinterest in her stories and events of her life feels a lot like disinterest in her.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:10.500
The advice of Proverbs 20 and verse 5 is good for husbands.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.500
It says, the thoughts of a man, or we could say in this case,

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:21.500
women's heart are like deep waters, but the discerning man draws them out.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.500
That's great advice for husbands.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:29.500
Husbands, when you draw your wife out, let her speak from her heart.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:34.500
That's an indication of great love and affection for your dear wife.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:39.500
Men, on the other hand, often view conversation differently.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.500
A husband comes home and his wife asks, how was your day?

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.500
He says, it was okay, nothing special.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.500
But later than at night, when they're with a group of friends,

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.500
he tells a story about what happened at work.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:57.500
And she wonders, well, why didn't he tell me that when I asked about his day?

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:03.500
Well, since a man's emphasis is on respect, they often use conversation

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.500
to establish respect and status with others.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.500
A husband may feel that his wife already respects him,

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.500
so there's no need to tell her the story.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.500
Wives, you can encourage your husband to share his life with you

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.500
by being interested in his work and activities.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:24.500
If you tell him, don't talk to me about all that work stuff with me,

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.500
he won't.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.500
And you'll cut yourself off from a part of his life.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.500
Show him you're proud of what he does to support the family.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:36.500
Be interested in what happened to him, how he feels about things

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.500
or challenges that he overcame.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.500
While you may not find his work all that interesting,

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:45.500
remember, it is important to him.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:50.500
Let's consider our second example, how they solve problems.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.500
Now, I want you to imagine a husband and wife, they're in a car,

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.500
they're looking for an address, and they're lost.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:00.500
And the wife suggests that they ask someone for directions.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:04.500
She's thinking, why won't he ask?

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.500
He's thinking, why can't she just let me find it?

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.500
You see, since the man's emphasis is on respect,

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:16.500
he's trying to avoid looking lost to a stranger.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:21.500
The act of asking someone else for directions may make him feel

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.500
like he's in a lower position.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.500
Finding their way is a challenge to him, and he wants to show his wife

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.500
that he can find it on his own.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.500
For the woman, such an idea may not come to mind.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.500
She may view it as a simple interchange between them and a stranger.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:41.500
They may get help in directions, and they find out where they're going.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:46.500
At 1 Corinthians chapter 7 and verse 33, Jehovah tells us,

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:52.500
but the married man is anxious, how he may gain the approval of his wife.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:57.500
Wives your husband is anxious to have your approval and respect.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:01.500
But on balance, husbands have to be careful that an emphasis on respect

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.500
doesn't become unreasonable.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.500
He won't hurt us to ask for directions or help at times.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:12.500
On the other hand, a wife needs to be careful that she doesn't show impatience

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:18.500
by her words or tone as her husband works his way through a problem.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:22.500
A wife who clearly understands her husband's desire to solve problems

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:27.500
for the family will understand his actions and will do her part to support him,

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.500
even in the little things around the home.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:35.500
Now, this support in the little areas of life builds his confidence in her support

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:42.500
and can be a major factor in whether a husband takes the lead in larger matters.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:48.500
Our third and final example, how they act in front of others.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.500
Have you ever seen a couple where one of them is telling a story

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:56.500
and the other is constantly correcting the details?

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.500
Or the husband is trying to give some direction

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:03.500
and the wife corrects or challenges the direction?

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:09.500
Or the husband is telling others some unflattering story that hurts his wife's feelings.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:15.500
How can Ephesians 533 help a wife in these situations?

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.500
Well, since a husband's emphasis is on respect,

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:24.500
he'll be much more sensitive to comments his wife may make in front of others.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:31.500
It can hurt a husband deeply when his wife openly challenges him in front of others.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:37.500
Proverbs 31 and verse 12 has this advice for wives.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:43.500
She rewards him with good, not bad, all the days of her life.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:48.500
So when in public or when others are around, even close family and children,

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:52.500
try not to openly disagree with him, correct him,

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.500
or attempt to take over what he's doing.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:02.500
How you speak to your husband in front of others is a great way to show your deep respect for him.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:08.850
It also builds respect for him and others, including any children in the family.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:14.850
Well, how can Ephesians 533 help a husband act in front of others?

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:22.850
Well, when in public, husbands will want to act like the husband in Proverbs 31 and verse 28.

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:27.850
It says her husband rises up and praises her.

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:34.850
It's common today for husbands to make fun of, or even say demeaning things about their wives.

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:38.850
But since a wife places so much emphasis on connection and friendship,

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:43.850
she can really be hurt when demeaning remarks are said to get a laugh.

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:45.850
It makes her feel awful.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:51.850
Husbands, your wife considers you her best friend, the one she shares everything with.

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:56.850
If you break that trust, she feels unloved and hurt.

00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:01.850
Now, the best time to bring matters to each other's attention is when you're in private,

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:07.850
or if needed, when you can talk in such a way that others cannot hear what's being said.

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:17.320
In this way, a wife shows deep respect for her husband, and the husband shows his love for his wife.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:27.320
So in review, we've considered just three situations that the principle of love and respect can help us to have a successful marriage.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:36.320
How husband and wife talk to each other, how they solve problems, and how they act in the company of others.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:41.320
A good marriage is hard work. How was your marriage?

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:47.320
Would you say that you've developed good patterns or bad patterns in dealing with each other?

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:54.320
When was the last time you talked as a couple about love and respect for each other?

00:14:54.320 --> 00:15:03.320
Jehovah's perfect advice at Ephesians 533 can help the marriage of two imperfect people.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:09.320
In just a few words in this verse, Jehovah is sharing with us a key principle of how he designed marriage.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:14.320
He's telling us what each needs and places emphasis on.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:21.320
Husbands put emphasis on being respected, and wives put emphasis on being loved.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:27.320
And this principle forms a key part of the divine pattern for marriage.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:32.320
If you want your marriage to operate as Jehovah designed,

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:40.320
then work hard to apply his perfect principle of love and respect in your marriage.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:48.429
Why can we be confident that Bible principles for husbands and wives work?

00:15:48.429 --> 00:15:52.429
Because they've worked for Jehovah's people in the past.

00:15:52.429 --> 00:15:59.429
In the following dramatization, notice what wives and husbands can learn from the example of Sarah.

00:15:59.429 --> 00:16:34.500
Pioneering where the need is greater wasn't easy.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:38.500
After a long day in service, I had a part to work on.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:44.500
Thankfully, just to care of everything so I could focus on my part.

00:16:44.500 --> 00:17:12.720
She's the best. Poor thing. She was exhausted. Good thing we were turning in early.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:26.309
William and I couldn't agree on much lately. We couldn't afford this.

00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:32.299
There had to be something cheaper, but he wouldn't listen.

00:17:32.299 --> 00:17:50.539
Sometimes, I feel my husband doesn't make the best decisions.

00:17:50.539 --> 00:18:01.650
I just wish he'd value my suggestions.

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.650
Frankly, I've given up trying.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:15.380
Just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him Lord.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:22.380
Hebrews 11 and Isaiah 51 also cite Sarah as a fine example for Christian wives.

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:28.380
But Christian husbands can also learn much from carefully examining.

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:32.380
Sarah's example for me.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:51.259
Sarah was willing to move to parts unknown.

00:18:51.259 --> 00:19:05.720
A life fraught with danger and hardship.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:13.569
She unselfishly supported Abraham no matter what.

00:19:13.569 --> 00:19:35.740
Just like my Jessica, she does without, never complains.

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:45.019
What a gem. I can do better, letting her know just how precious she is to me.

00:19:45.019 --> 00:20:08.279
Sarah submissively obeyed her husband.

00:20:08.279 --> 00:20:44.190
But she also spoke up. She loved her son.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:47.190
And she knew what was at stake.

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:56.430
God's promises through Isaac, even though she knew it would upset Abraham.

00:20:56.430 --> 00:21:12.579
She spoke up.

00:21:12.579 --> 00:21:15.579
She must have thought carefully before speaking to him.

00:21:15.579 --> 00:21:20.140
After all, she called him Lord.

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:27.859
Jehovah blessed her for her loyal support of Abraham.

00:21:27.859 --> 00:21:30.859
Even reminding him to listen to her.

00:21:30.859 --> 00:21:41.779
I knew I couldn't expect Jehovah to whisper in my husband's ear.

00:21:41.779 --> 00:21:44.779
Did my speech show respect? Like Sarah?

00:21:44.779 --> 00:21:49.769
I needed to tell him how I felt.

00:21:49.769 --> 00:21:52.769
But I needed to do it the right way.

00:21:52.769 --> 00:21:58.230
That night, we spoke.

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:07.710
And little by little, things started to improve.

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:09.710
Imitating Sarah.

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:11.710
Really worked.

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:23.369
In our next video, we'll get to know Claudius Johnson.

00:22:23.369 --> 00:22:26.369
Even though his wife died over 20 years ago,

00:22:26.369 --> 00:22:30.369
I think you'll see from his interview that his spiritual qualities

00:22:30.369 --> 00:22:37.369
and focus on Kingdom interest enhanced his over four decades of marriage.

00:22:37.369 --> 00:22:40.369
Prayer is an important thing.

00:22:40.369 --> 00:22:47.369
Everything I do, I always go to Jehovah in prayer and ask for his guidance.

00:22:47.369 --> 00:22:54.369
I was born in the 26th of March, 1923 in Panama.

00:22:54.369 --> 00:23:00.369
I was baptized on August 1946 at Cleveland, Ohio.

00:23:00.369 --> 00:23:07.809
I've started pioneering in January of 1947,

00:23:07.809 --> 00:23:12.809
where there are a couple of scriptures that have been most influential in my life.

00:23:12.809 --> 00:23:17.809
One in Psalm 55-22, which says,

00:23:17.809 --> 00:23:21.809
through your burden on Jehovah, and he will sustain you,

00:23:21.809 --> 00:23:26.809
never will he allow the righteous one to fall.

00:23:26.809 --> 00:23:33.809
One of the most trying experiences of my life was facing the selective service board.

00:23:33.809 --> 00:23:36.809
I registered as was required by law,

00:23:36.809 --> 00:23:42.809
and I received a classification of 1A, fit for military service.

00:23:42.809 --> 00:23:46.809
I then spoke with the Society's legal department,

00:23:46.809 --> 00:23:52.809
and I was instructed to appeal the decision, because I was a regular pioneer.

00:23:52.809 --> 00:23:58.809
I had to go to the draft board, and there I was severely questioned.

00:23:58.809 --> 00:24:03.809
One of the problems they had was that I had a part-time job,

00:24:03.809 --> 00:24:11.809
and they felt that that interfered with my being classified as a full-time minister.

00:24:11.809 --> 00:24:16.809
However, because I was conducting about 12 Bible studies at that time,

00:24:16.809 --> 00:24:22.809
I took copies of all those records and presented it to the board.

00:24:22.809 --> 00:24:24.809
The chairman said to me,

00:24:24.809 --> 00:24:27.809
are you saying if we were to talk to all of these people,

00:24:27.809 --> 00:24:31.809
they would tell us that you're conducting Bible study with them every week,

00:24:31.809 --> 00:24:32.809
and I said, yes, sir.

00:24:32.809 --> 00:24:36.440
While they are deliberating,

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:42.069
I am praying hard to help them to make a proper decision.

00:24:42.069 --> 00:24:48.069
In a few days' time, the classification card came as 4D.

00:24:48.069 --> 00:24:51.069
I was classified as a religious minister,

00:24:51.069 --> 00:24:55.069
and I lift my thought to Jehovah, and thank you, Jehovah, very much.

00:24:55.069 --> 00:24:59.539
And when I was in the circuit work in Cuba,

00:24:59.539 --> 00:25:03.539
I had a few encounters with soldiers.

00:25:03.539 --> 00:25:09.539
It's difficult to understand the tense atmosphere that existed back in those days,

00:25:09.539 --> 00:25:15.539
the freedom that those rivers had with shooting people and even participants.

00:25:15.539 --> 00:25:18.539
They didn't have a second thought.

00:25:18.539 --> 00:25:22.539
I had just got through serving a congregation in the hills,

00:25:22.539 --> 00:25:26.539
and we took the local bus that ran around that area,

00:25:26.539 --> 00:25:33.539
and on the highway, two soldiers stopped the bus and ordered all men to come off.

00:25:33.539 --> 00:25:36.539
They started looking at each of us, one by one,

00:25:36.539 --> 00:25:39.539
sending everybody back on the bus, and they looked at me and said,

00:25:39.539 --> 00:25:40.539
you, stay there.

00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:43.539
Pointed at the rifle at me and said, war you.

00:25:43.539 --> 00:25:47.539
I explained myself, but they kept pointing at the rifle.

00:25:47.539 --> 00:25:51.539
One of the soldiers said to the driver, take off.

00:25:51.539 --> 00:25:53.539
But that's when you pray hard,

00:25:53.539 --> 00:25:57.539
and you remember the scripture, Proverbs 29.25,

00:25:57.539 --> 00:26:00.539
trembling at men is a snare,

00:26:00.539 --> 00:26:05.539
but the one trusting in Jehovah will be protected.

00:26:06.539 --> 00:26:08.539
So the driver said, no.

00:26:08.539 --> 00:26:11.539
He is a circuit over syrup. He rides with me on the wall,

00:26:11.539 --> 00:26:18.539
and he really defended me and makes me believe that Jehovah's Angels intervened.

00:26:18.539 --> 00:26:22.539
And that's why I said, I am a slave to prayer.

00:26:22.539 --> 00:26:26.539
It's the most important thing in my life.

00:26:26.539 --> 00:26:29.539
When I came back to the United States,

00:26:29.539 --> 00:26:34.539
I was being used by the service department in the first time work.

00:26:34.539 --> 00:26:41.539
A few years later, I had to give up the full-time work and take care of my family.

00:26:41.539 --> 00:26:45.539
The adjustment I had to make to a family man was hard,

00:26:45.539 --> 00:26:50.539
because most of my life was occupied in the full-time service.

00:26:50.539 --> 00:26:55.849
But I had to leave matters in Jehovah's hands.

00:26:55.849 --> 00:26:59.849
We started the prison ministry around May of 1974.

00:26:59.849 --> 00:27:02.849
It gives you a measure of satisfaction

00:27:02.849 --> 00:27:09.849
and seeing how the Bible has a very strong influence on individuals.

00:27:09.849 --> 00:27:13.849
To see criminals turn their life completely around,

00:27:13.849 --> 00:27:15.849
the Bible changes lives.

00:27:15.849 --> 00:27:20.849
And that's why pioneering has always been in my heart.

00:27:20.849 --> 00:27:23.849
And so after my wife died,

00:27:23.849 --> 00:27:28.849
I felt that the proper thing to do was to get back into the full-time service.

00:27:28.849 --> 00:27:33.849
And as a result of that, I started pioneering again in 1998.

00:27:33.849 --> 00:27:36.849
Jehovah God has been good to me,

00:27:36.849 --> 00:27:38.849
and at my age of 96,

00:27:38.849 --> 00:27:43.849
I thank Jehovah every day for the health and strength he promised me to enjoy.

00:27:43.849 --> 00:27:50.690
And I keep on going.

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:54.690
Did you notice that it was prayer that helped Brother Johnson and his family

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:58.690
to face a variety of changing circumstances?

00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:03.690
He continues to display the same spirit at nearly 98 years of age.

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:09.220
Are you married to someone who doesn't serve Jehovah?

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:12.220
Or is even opposed to the truth?

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:16.220
You'll appreciate the experience of Alexandra and Dorina Vakar.

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:28.130
I started to study the Bible in 1993.

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:31.130
At that time, I was 43 years old.

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:35.130
I was married for 19 years and I had two children.

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:40.130
At that time, I didn't know if I would become one of Jehovah's Witnesses or not,

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:43.130
but I accepted a Bible study.

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:48.130
My husband's request, I started studying the Bible at the same time,

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:51.130
but I only studied for about a year.

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:55.130
Then I decided, I'm going to stop.

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:58.130
I asked him to stop studying too.

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:01.130
I told him, let's stop studying. This is not for us.

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:03.130
We don't understand it.

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:11.170
But in a very diplomatic and calm way, he said he would continue.

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:14.170
When I realized he would continue studying, I said to myself,

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:17.170
well, all right then, just you wait and see.

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:21.170
If you really want to continue, I will somehow make you stop studying

00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:25.170
in a subtle way, but I will do it.

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:29.170
Just seeing him get ready to go in the field so as annoyed me so much.

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:33.170
I started burying him with household chores,

00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:38.930
asking him to help me more and more around the house.

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:46.970
But calmly and gently every time he would ask me if he could prepare for meetings.

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:49.970
And one time when he asked me if he could prepare for the meeting,

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:52.970
yet again, I got irritated and said,

00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:54.970
you're not going to prepare now.

00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:57.970
We're going to clean the whole apartment thoroughly

00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:02.309
after we were finally finished at midnight.

00:30:02.309 --> 00:30:07.309
He asked me very calmly if there was anything else he could help me with.

00:30:07.309 --> 00:30:14.329
It was not easy for him to deal with my efforts to force him to stop studying.

00:30:14.329 --> 00:30:18.329
And after he got up, I tried even harder.

00:30:18.329 --> 00:30:22.329
But he never retaliated. He stayed calm and endured it.

00:30:22.329 --> 00:30:29.279
In this period, I was trying to understand her reactions.

00:30:29.279 --> 00:30:33.329
But it wasn't easy for me.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.880
Hearing her criticisms, those harsh replies,

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.880
I thought sometimes I think I'll just give up.

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:49.250
It makes no sense to go on like this.

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:52.250
I said to the brother who was studying with me about this,

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:55.559
I want to stop.

00:30:55.559 --> 00:30:57.559
And he encouraged me.

00:30:57.559 --> 00:31:00.559
He said, no, no, don't stop.

00:31:00.559 --> 00:31:01.559
Don't quit.

00:31:01.559 --> 00:31:03.559
Continue, continue.

00:31:03.559 --> 00:31:06.559
Probably your wife will follow you.

00:31:06.559 --> 00:31:09.559
These conversations always encourage me.

00:31:09.559 --> 00:31:11.559
And when we were finished our study,

00:31:11.559 --> 00:31:15.559
I would see things from a different perspective.

00:31:15.559 --> 00:31:17.559
I always loved my wife.

00:31:17.559 --> 00:31:20.559
And I wanted her to be by my side.

00:31:20.559 --> 00:31:28.269
During this period, he often told me how much he loved me.

00:31:28.269 --> 00:31:30.269
Many times, yes, very often.

00:31:30.269 --> 00:31:34.269
And sometimes he would ask me if I loved him too.

00:31:34.269 --> 00:31:37.269
There were times when I would answer him.

00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:42.970
And there were times when I just smiled and said nothing.

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:47.970
And I even thought, hey, this guy really cares about me.

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:49.970
I was impressed by his kindness.

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:51.970
I was very impressed.

00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:55.970
Many times, I was musing, well, as a man, he could hit me.

00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:57.970
He could be demanding.

00:31:57.970 --> 00:31:59.970
You will sit down, you know?

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:02.970
But no, he never did that.

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:04.970
He never raised his voice.

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:06.970
Never spoke a mean word.

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:08.970
Never.

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:11.970
When she saw that I did not retaliate as in,

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:14.970
I would not reply harshly and I would not talk badly to her,

00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:20.539
then eventually she would calm down.

00:32:20.539 --> 00:32:24.539
In his calm and mild way, he began inviting me to the meetings.

00:32:24.539 --> 00:32:28.539
He kept on inviting me and sometimes I was willing to accept.

00:32:28.539 --> 00:32:32.539
Slowly, I started to attend the meetings.

00:32:32.539 --> 00:32:33.539
I was happy.

00:32:33.539 --> 00:32:37.539
I was very happy when she said she wanted to resume her study.

00:32:40.009 --> 00:32:44.009
In August 2006, I started studying the Bible again.

00:32:44.009 --> 00:32:49.009
And in March 2007, I became an Umbattized Publisher.

00:32:49.009 --> 00:32:54.009
And in July 2007, I decided to get baptized.

00:32:54.009 --> 00:32:59.730
I served in the baptism department.

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:08.420
And I had the privilege to personally baptize my dear wife.

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:31.759
First Corinthians 134 says that love is patient and kind.

00:33:31.759 --> 00:33:36.759
Patients means, first of all, being patient for months,

00:33:36.759 --> 00:33:39.759
years, or maybe even decades.

00:33:39.759 --> 00:33:42.759
Never give up.

00:33:42.759 --> 00:33:51.400
Never consider someone as a lost cause.

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:56.400
Even though Alexandru and Dorina's marriage was far from ideal for a long time,

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:59.400
Alexandru didn't lose his patience.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:02.400
He was calm and loving.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:07.400
That promoted peace, and eventually it moved Dorina to embrace the truth.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:12.400
If you have an unbelieving mate, remember Alexandru's example.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:17.400
And as he said, never give up.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:22.400
Ecclesiastes chapter 4 in verse 12 speaks of a threefold chord

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:25.400
that cannot quickly be torn apart.

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:28.400
That's often applied to Christian marriage.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.400
But what does that threefold chord mean?

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:35.400
And how does it make a marriage successful?

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:38.400
We'll learn the answers in our next segment.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:35:01.280
So a summertime, a group of brothers and sisters,

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:05.280
we made arrangements to during the vacation time to go to the beach.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:08.280
And so during that time,

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:11.280
heading to the beaches where I met her.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.280
I hadn't met her sisters, but I had not met her.

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:21.820
My grandparents and my aunt were a very important part in raising me and my sisters.

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:23.820
They learned the truth first in Ecuador,

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:26.820
and we always lived close by.

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:29.820
I always went to visit them,

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:33.820
and they helped my parents in guiding me into the truth.

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:38.820
So first three or four years of our marriage,

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:40.820
we were about an hour and a half away from my family.

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:42.820
That was really hard on me.

00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:45.820
I'm close to my sister, so it was kind of hard being so far.

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:47.820
To me, that was really far.

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:53.820
I knew early on that one of the most important things that I needed in the main,

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:55.820
someone who loved Jehovah.

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.820
And they always say, I remember my parents,

00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:59.820
and the meeting always say,

00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:01.820
find someone who loves Jehovah more than it loves you.

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:03.820
And it's easy to say that.

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:07.380
But as you find someone you realize,

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:10.380
she loves Jehovah more than she loves me.

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:12.380
And she had demonstrated through her entire marriage.

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:15.380
When it comes to Jehovah is first.

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:18.380
I think that is the key for a successful marriage.

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:22.789
I think the biggest challenge we went through in our marriage

00:36:22.789 --> 00:36:24.789
was our first year in the circuit work.

00:36:24.789 --> 00:36:27.789
Hard enough moving 3,000 miles away from everyone,

00:36:27.789 --> 00:36:29.789
starting a new type of life.

00:36:29.789 --> 00:36:32.789
Two months later, my grandfather dies.

00:36:32.789 --> 00:36:34.789
Six months right after that, my mother dies.

00:36:34.789 --> 00:36:37.789
After her mom dies, my mom passed away.

00:36:37.789 --> 00:36:43.030
This one right after the other.

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:46.030
That was a difficult time for us.

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:54.500
All the pain and suffering from losing our moms and loved ones.

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:59.500
Many times we felt that we were not continuing.

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:04.260
It was overwhelming.

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:09.260
The period of time was eight months and ten days

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.260
between the death of Mimi's mom and my mom.

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:25.440
The threefold chord is the routine in which Jehovah was included in the marriage.

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:29.440
From reading the Bible together to going in the ministry together

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:33.440
to doing everyday things together.

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:38.440
And as you do this, Jehovah is present in your marriage.

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:40.440
We always think that it's our Bible reading.

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:44.440
Actually, we don't think we realize our Bible reading is very important for us.

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:51.440
We pick a book, we start reading it, and we know that is what keeps us together.

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:54.440
We were both already pioneering before we got married.

00:37:54.440 --> 00:38:00.440
And as we got married, we just figure out a way to continue pioneering together.

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:05.440
Just make sure to start our spiritual careers together.

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:10.440
So we have to always depend on Jehovah, which is the best person to always depend on.

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:16.440
We spend a lot of time by ourselves driving from city to city, from state to state.

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:21.440
And we had plenty of time to reflect, to talk, to draw close to each other,

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:27.440
to not only rely on Jehovah, but also be closer between us.

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:35.440
And spend more time talking about the visit, talking about the friends, talking about how we feel.

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:43.440
I think at the end it was the toughest assignment, but it was the most rewarding of all the assignments we had had

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:46.440
in all these years and the childhood work.

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:50.440
Because it's three of us and Jehovah is an equal part in our marriage,

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:54.440
it doesn't matter what we go through, whether it be Peter or I,

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:57.440
that having a little bit of a struggle because Jehovah is there,

00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:00.440
it's going to keep us united and strong.

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:04.440
And also, it's not just in the things we do while we worship.

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.440
Yes, we worship together.

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:10.440
But it's also all the other things that we do to Jehovah's way.

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:15.440
We're best friends and we enjoy spending time together outside of service and the meetings.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:19.440
We like doing fun things outside, we like the outdoors.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:25.039
When we're facing a difficult challenge, we will go to Joe and prayer together,

00:39:25.039 --> 00:39:29.039
specifically Jehovah help us with this challenge.

00:39:29.039 --> 00:39:35.039
Our assignments has helped us to always be with each other because we have the same goals in mind.

00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:38.039
We're working together for the same purpose.

00:39:38.039 --> 00:39:47.039
The same schedule, spiritual schedule has really helped us to go through this challenging periods in our life.

00:39:47.039 --> 00:39:51.039
But knowing that Jehovah is our creator, the sovereign being,

00:39:51.039 --> 00:39:54.039
he's the one who should tell us what to do.

00:39:54.039 --> 00:39:58.039
And there is an arrangement and when you follow his arrangement,

00:39:58.039 --> 00:40:01.739
there's happiness, there's success.

00:40:01.739 --> 00:40:15.460
We're in an imperfect world, but his arrangement works and we have felt it.

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:23.460
When husbands and wives are united with Jehovah, their marriage is as strong as that threefold cord.

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:27.460
The Bible uses another term to describe the unity of husband and wife.

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:30.460
They become one flesh.

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:35.460
This was the topic of a morning worship program presented by Brother Robert Serenco.

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:43.280
Genesis 224 says of a man and a woman who marry that they are to become one flesh.

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:46.280
Now that raises some questions.

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.280
Whose words are those?

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.280
What do they mean?

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:52.280
How can we show that we believe them?

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:56.280
And is there a good example in the Bible of a couple who did?

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:59.280
Let's start with looking at the context.

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:02.280
If you'd open your Bible, please do Genesis chapter 2.

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:06.280
And we'll start with verse 18, Genesis 2.

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:08.280
The report says,

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:12.280
Jehovah God said it is not good for the man to continue to be alone.

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:17.280
I'm going to make a helper for him as a compliment of him.

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.280
Continuing in verse 21,

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:23.280
So Jehovah God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep.

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:28.280
And while he was sleeping, he took one of his ribs and then closed up the flesh over its place.

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:34.280
And Jehovah God built the rib that he had taken from the man into a woman and he brought her to the man.

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:35.280
Then the man said,

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.280
Quote,

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:40.280
This is at last bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:45.280
This one will be called woman because for man she was taken.

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.280
Unquote.

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:54.280
That is why a man will leave his father and his mother and he will stick to his wife and they will become one flesh.

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:58.280
So our first question is whose words are these?

00:41:58.280 --> 00:41:59.280
Atoms?

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:00.280
No.

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:05.280
The only words attributed to Adam are when he waxed poetic in verse 23.

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:10.280
And you can see that from the opening and closing quotation marks in that verse.

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:15.280
Well, then it must have been Moses words because after all he wrote the Bible book of Genesis.

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:19.280
No, he was not present at the time of the first marriage.

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:23.280
He did not start writing until some 2500 years later.

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:28.280
And even then he was writing what he was inspired to write.

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:35.280
The Bible writers use this expression one flesh, Matthew, Mark, and Paul.

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:38.280
And it's Matthew who gives us the clues to whose words they are.

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:42.280
So let's turn to Matthew chapter 19.

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:49.800
Matthew 19 beginning with verse four.

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:54.800
And here Matthew writes and quotes Jesus.

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.800
It says in reply, he Jesus said,

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:05.800
Have you not read that the one who created them from the beginning made the male and female and said,

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:13.800
quote, for this reason, a man will leave his father and his mother and will stick to his wife and the two will be one flesh, unquote.

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:16.800
So that they are no longer two, but one flesh.

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:20.800
Therefore what God has joked together, let no man put apart.

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:25.800
So Matthew makes a clear Jehovah said those words.

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:31.800
And shouldn't that elevate and everyone's mind the sanctity of the marital union?

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:40.800
As Jesus said, God created male and female two complementary genders and he joked them together in marriage as one flesh.

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:45.800
Now it's interesting what the Bible exposition commentary says about this.

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:50.800
God established marriage and therefore only God can control its character.

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:54.800
It is a union between one man and one woman.

00:43:54.800 --> 00:44:02.800
God did not create two men and one woman, two women and one man, two men or two women.

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:07.800
Group marriages, gay marriages and other variations are contrary to the will of God.

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:14.800
No matter what some psychologists and jurists may say, no court of law can change what God has established.

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:17.800
And those are comments we can agree with.

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:22.800
Now our second question is what do these words mean they will become one flesh?

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:29.800
Well, of course the one flesh relationship certainly involves sexual union, but it goes beyond that.

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:37.800
Because it includes a husband and wife who have achieved mental, emotional and spiritual harmony.

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:41.800
They are to have a oneness in their purpose and desires.

00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:49.800
As Bible translator William Barkley renders it at Matthew 19.5, the husband will be joined inseparably to his wife.

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:56.800
So in marriage a man and a woman are to become each other's closest partner in life.

00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:02.800
Being one flesh means that they must always be thinking more of each other than of themselves,

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:06.800
that they must consider each other in everything they do.

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:14.800
So when single people marry they need to shift their thinking from mine to ours, from me to we.

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:21.800
And so they must stop being single at heart and come to be married at heart, not just on paper.

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:25.800
Now our third question is how can we show that we believe these words?

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:29.800
Well, sad to say many people these days take a very casual attitude toward marriage.

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:35.800
And when the relationship becomes strange, they just give up and walk out on their mate.

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:40.800
But that is not the Christian way. Marriage is to be a lifelong relationship.

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:47.800
Just a few verses later on in Matthew 19 verse 9, Jesus taught that the only scriptural ground for dissolving marriage

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:52.800
is one in innocent mate, chooses not to forgive an adulterous partner.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:46:01.800
And that is because sexual relations outside the marriage bond are a gross perversion of the one flesh union.

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:03.800
Now let's read Paul's words about this.

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:10.800
First Corinthians 6 and verse 16.

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:19.780
He said, do you not know that anyone who is joined to a prostitute is one body with her?

00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:23.780
For the two says he will be one flesh.

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:30.780
So the adulterer pulls away from his marriage mate and makes himself one flesh with a third person.

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:34.780
That then is the only scriptural basis for divorce.

00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:37.780
But divorce is a very painful experience.

00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:41.780
As one sociologist put it, divorce is drastic surgery.

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:49.780
To sever the one flesh bond between husband and wife would be like sawing oneself a sunder.

00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:52.780
What though if no adultery has been committed?

00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:57.780
But for some reason, two people who are married to each other just don't like each other any longer.

00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:59.780
Divorce is not an option.

00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:05.780
Instead, they need to remind themselves of what attracted them to each other and work at rekindling those feelings,

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:14.780
while at the same time looking to Jehovah for help in not only strengthening their marriage, but also their spirituality.

00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:23.780
Our fourth question is, what scriptural example is there of a married couple who believe this one flesh idea?

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:27.780
Turn to Romans 16 and verse 3, please.

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:30.780
Romans 16 and 3.

00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:38.780
Here Paul writes, give my greetings to Priska or Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus.

00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:48.780
So yes, Aquila and Priscilla, what a model of a close and united couple living up to what Jehovah meant when he said that a husband or wife should become one flesh.

00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:57.780
And Paul, who worked closely with them, could not think of that dear brother without recalling the faithful cooperation of his wife.

00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:00.780
So it's a fine example for Christian couples today.

00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:09.780
And in every one of the six references to this couple in the Christian Greek scriptures, we find them working together, cooperating without competition or strife.

00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:13.780
And never is one mentioned without the other.

00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:18.780
They constantly work together in their home, in their secular work, in the ministry.

00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:28.780
And surely it was a time spent together in Christian activities that kept their marriage on a high spiritual plane working side by side to further the kingdom work.

00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:35.780
Now you and your marriage may be a part for much of the day due to different work and responsibilities.

00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:49.780
But can you find time each day to eat meals together, to do household chores together, to take walks together, to be together to get caught up on what has gone on in your lives during the day.

00:48:49.780 --> 00:49:00.780
Aquila and Priscilla prove that being united in activities related to true worship can keep a couple's thinking and goals aligned and that does strengthen a marriage.

00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:11.780
For example, studying together, participating in congregation meetings together, sharing in the ministry together, praying together, in doing all of that.

00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:27.780
A person's interests, priorities and habits will harmonize with those of one's spouse until like Aquila and Priscilla, we increasingly think, feel and act as one flesh.

00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:36.780
So now we know who said the words, it was Jehovah. We understand what they mean, achieving harmony in one's relationship with one's mate.

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:45.780
And we can certainly prove that we believe these words by staying close to our mate and maintaining our marriage bond.

00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:52.030
And then we have that excellent example of Aquila and Priscilla to abide by.

00:49:52.030 --> 00:50:02.030
One flesh, a three-fold cord, one husband and wife apply Bible principles, their marriage endures, and is successful.

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:29.460
And we'll see that in our new music video.

00:50:29.460 --> 00:54:19.489
The theme of this month's program was, show love and respect in your marriage.

00:54:19.489 --> 00:54:28.489
Sarah's example shows wives how to give their husband suggestions and husbands how to show appreciation for their wives.

00:54:28.489 --> 00:54:33.489
We learned the importance of prayer when we face changing circumstances.

00:54:33.489 --> 00:54:38.489
And Alexandra's love and patience helped his wife serve Jehovah.

00:54:38.489 --> 00:54:46.489
By integrating Jehovah into their marriages, couples can overcome challenges and serve Jehovah together.

00:54:46.489 --> 00:54:53.489
Now let's enjoy our video postcard. This month we visit our brothers and sisters in Guyana.

00:54:54.489 --> 00:55:01.489
This country of more than 750,000 people is in the northeastern corner of South America.

00:55:01.489 --> 00:55:14.489
This is a land of lush rainforests, sugarcane plantations, and open grasslands, temperatures and humidity are high, and the rainfall is heavy.

00:55:14.489 --> 00:55:18.489
In fact, Guyana means land of water.

00:55:18.489 --> 00:55:25.489
These brothers are with the congregation and charity, a part of Guyana known for extensive preaching done along the river.

00:55:25.489 --> 00:55:32.489
More than half of Guyana's population is rural, and most people live in villages in the coastal region.

00:55:32.489 --> 00:55:37.489
This is Baramita, a caribou language-speaking community known for gold mining.

00:55:37.489 --> 00:55:45.489
The congregation's 119 publishers conduct an average of 228 Bible studies every month.

00:55:46.489 --> 00:55:51.489
Baramita is also home to a remote translation office.

00:55:51.489 --> 00:55:59.489
Many people live scattered throughout the surrounding dense jungle, and reaching them requires hours and hours of walking.

00:55:59.489 --> 00:56:08.489
Because the rainy season is over half of the year, travel can be very difficult, but our brothers and sisters, they're not deterred by the terrain.

00:56:08.489 --> 00:56:20.489
Now these are typical dwellings of the caribou community in Baramita, and our brothers, they preach to everyone they encounter, from cassava farmers to gold miners.

00:56:20.489 --> 00:56:26.489
Our brothers and sisters in the Baramita congregation send you their warm love and greetings.

00:56:26.489 --> 00:56:31.489
From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
