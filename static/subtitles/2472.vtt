00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:15.150
Sophia, Zoe and Camille should be here soon.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.390
Are you ready?

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.989
Oh, is everything okay?

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:23.989
No.

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:29.989
I really want Zoe's mom to say the Bible, but what if I mess up?

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.829
Or what if she asks questions I can't even answer?

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.579
What am I going to do?

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:47.159
Sometimes I get nervous too, but we don't have to worry.

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:48.159
Why not?

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:54.759
Well, think of the flowers we planted outside the house.

00:00:54.759 --> 00:01:03.380
We planted all the bulbs, yeah, and then you watered them.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:09.459
Just like flowers that have been planted, when we tell others about Jehovah, it's like

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:13.099
planting a little seed of truth.

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:19.299
And when you continue to teach them, it's like watering that seed.

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.140
But what makes the flowers grow?

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:31.859
Did you make it grow?

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:38.230
No, that's silly.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.349
They need sunlight.

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:42.430
And who gives us sunlight?

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.430
Jehovah.

00:01:44.269 --> 00:01:47.109
Oh, he makes it grow.

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:54.590
Yes, Jehovah is the one who makes a love for the truth, grow in a person's heart.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.390
And he can do that for Zoe's mom.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.819
Wow, they're here.

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:06.780
You know, I think we'll make a great team.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.020
Thanks, mom.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.780
I know we will, because we're working with Jehovah.
