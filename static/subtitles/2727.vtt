00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:12.679
I was born 1993 into a men and a night family, and from childhood on I learned that God created

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:18.579
us to suffer, to work the fields and to try to be worthy to go to heaven.

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:22.539
But from infancy I decided to do what God wanted for me.

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:29.679
I wanted him to be pleased with me, that was the desire of my heart.

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:34.280
Years back I started to get the feeling that the memorized prayers I would recite from

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.759
my German prayer book, just weren't enough.

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:44.119
They were not the prayers that I felt in my heart, didn't even understand them.

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:50.159
I wanted to tell God how I really felt, and that's what I did.

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:54.640
All of a sudden I couldn't resist praying in my own language.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.119
I told God everything.

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:59.600
I opened my heart to Him.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.480
One thing I asked for was that He might help my family so that we could do the right

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.439
thing and be safe.

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.159
When I finished I felt much calmer, and from then on I always prayed that way.

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.799
Later my mother bought a Bible in our language, and that just happened to be when Jehovah's

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.480
Witnesses started to visit us.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.480
Jehovah heard my prayer.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.239
They came on a regular basis, and it was so remarkable, we were amazed how they answered

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:34.439
all our questions in our own language and with our own Bible.

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:43.900
God impressed me very much, then when I was a teenager I finished school.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:50.620
Soon afterwards I started working at the job that was 3 and a half hours away from home.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.739
At the same time I started to go out like the other young people, looking for a girlfriend

00:01:56.739 --> 00:02:05.719
and drinking, but later my conscience tormented me.

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:11.919
My family was taking the Bible study very seriously, but I didn't.

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:14.199
But suddenly things changed.

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:21.759
In January 2010 our family attended a district convention, and that was very special for me.

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:25.520
It was so different from what I was used to.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.000
The brothers came and welcomed me and treated me so kindly.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.800
It was just amazing, I could hardly believe it, and the music they had, that was what touched

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.159
my heart, I liked it so much.

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:45.120
That was something I never forgot in all my life.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.280
In July 2010 I started to regularly attend the meetings as well.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.960
Then a brother asked me if I would like to study the Bible with him, using the book What

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.000
Does the Bible Really Teach?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.039
I then realized I had to do more if I wanted to please God.

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:07.599
It would have been good to attend every meeting, but since I worked far away I could not.

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.879
I could only attend the meetings on Sundays.

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:16.199
So I decided to ask my boss if he could give me a different job, but that didn't work,

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:18.719
it didn't want to make the change.

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:21.840
So I waited for a little while.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.520
I thought I would try asking again.

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:31.639
This time I asked him if I could attend the meeting in a congregation that was near my work.

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:34.159
But he didn't want to let me do that either.

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:36.360
And there was something else.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:43.240
He wanted to give me a large bonus if I would work for him until the end of the year.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:50.280
But I thought to myself, if I go on working, what will this show regarding my decision making?

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.439
If Jehovah's Day comes, what do I show as more important for me?

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:56.120
Jehovah or my work?

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.840
And so the decision was made.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.840
After I resung my work, I brought all my things home and I felt free, relieved, ready

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.000
to serve Jehovah.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.400
One week after I quit my job, I was approved to preach with the congregation.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.120
And what a great pleasure it was for me, when 4 months later I could dedicate myself

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.160
to Jehovah and get baptized.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.759
That made me so happy.
