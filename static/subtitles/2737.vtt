00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.879
Who are Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.880
We come from hundreds of ethnic and language backgrounds,

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.880
yet we share common beliefs and goals.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.879
We worship Jehovah, the God of the Bible, and the Creator of all things.

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:27.879
We are Christians, so we follow the teachings and example of Christ Jesus.

00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:31.879
Like Jesus, we strive to be honest, peaceful,

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:36.880
law-rebiting citizens of the land where we live.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.880
Even more important, we all follow Jesus' example

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.880
by regularly spending time helping people learn about the Bible and God's Kingdom.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.880
Because we witness or talk about Jehovah God in His Kingdom,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.880
we are known as Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.880
Each week, we meet together at Kingdom Halls to learn about God in His Word, the Bible.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.880
Our meetings are free and open to the public.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.879
We welcome you to visit us.
