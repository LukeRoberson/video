00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:07.849
Now, my theme is tap into the power beyond what is normal.

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:15.349
Jehovah God is the original source of all the power that exists in the universe.

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:23.850
Isaiah 4026 speaks of Jehovah's vast dynamic energy and awe-inspiring power.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.350
And we know, eons ago, he used this tremendous power to create his only begotten Son,

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.350
who became a tremendous source of power himself.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:45.350
But then, using him as a master worker, Jehovah brought into existence numerous other sources of power, both animate and inanimate.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.850
Now, we humans were made in God's image.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.850
And so, one of our main qualities just like Jehovah is power.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.850
We can use that power in a good way, a bad way.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.350
Now, Jehovah tells us, if you want to use it in a good way, I will help you.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:12.849
You can tap into me the most powerful source of help in the universe, and I will help you use your power for good.

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:18.849
I will give you power beyond what is normal, second Corinthians, for seven.

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:27.849
But now, if you think about that scripture, today's scripture, doesn't it indicate that we have to expend the power that is normal?

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:30.849
Jehovah gives the power beyond normal.

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:35.849
Why? Why does Jehovah not give all the power?

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:40.849
Well, if you think about it, if he gave us all the power, we needed to keep our integrity.

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:46.849
Would that prove the devil a liar? Would that prove we are integrity keepers?

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:49.849
No, it would just prove Jehovah has a lot of power.

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:58.849
But Satan would claim that Jehovah is unfairly using his power to give us a free ride through our test and trials.

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:05.849
But when we do our part, we do what is within our human limitations.

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:09.849
And then, Jehovah steps in and supplies the power beyond that.

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.849
Well, Satan can rightfully say nothing.

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:20.849
Now, here's another question. Why do we need the power beyond what is normal that Jehovah offers to us?

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.849
Well, it's because of the tremendous power of our three great enemies.

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:33.849
1 John 5.19, the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:40.849
Now, you think of a power that is capable of controlling more than 7.6 billion people on earth today.

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.849
I mean, that's some power of Satan.

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.849
Matthew 13.22 speaks about the deceptive power of riches.

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.849
That's just one of the powers the world promotes.

00:02:51.849 --> 00:03:02.849
Hebrews 3.13 talks about the deceptive power of sin, identifying the power of our imperfect flesh to try to pull us into wrong conduct.

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:10.849
So we've got to have this power beyond what is normal to resist these tremendous power sources that are against us.

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:17.849
But now, think about this. Just because a power source exists does not mean you automatically benefit.

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.849
You have to tap into it.

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.849
For example, the wind has power.

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.849
A windmill taps into it.

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.849
Running water has tremendous power.

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.849
A hydroelectric power plant taps into it.

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:33.849
The sun has tremendous power.

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:35.849
Solar panels tap into it.

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.849
Well, we have to tap into Jehovah.

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.849
And interestingly, Jehovah provides guidelines as to how we can tap into his power.

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.849
He also gives warnings as to what can impede.

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.849
You can even say block receiving power from him.

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:59.849
So with that being said, let's identify four contrasting examples of what we're going to call power from Jehovah.

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.849
Blockers power from Jehovah receivers.

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.849
Now, first example, doubt and faith.

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.849
Open up to James, chapter 1.

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.849
And notice what Jehovah tells us about doubt.

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.850
James 1, verse 6.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.850
But let him keep asking in faith not doubting at all.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.850
For the one who doubts is like the wave of the sea driven by the wind and blown about.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:34.850
In fact, that man should not expect to receive anything from Jehovah.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.850
And that anything includes power.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.850
In contrast, Matthew 17, 20, Jesus said,

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:46.850
if you have faith the size of a mustard grain, you will say to this mountain,

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.850
move from here to there.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.850
And it will move.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.850
And nothing will be impossible for you.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.850
So with faith, Jehovah gives us tremendous power to accomplish amazing things.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.850
And we have no valid reason really to doubt Jehovah or his organization.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.850
Now, let's get our second example.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.850
Power blocker power receiver.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.850
Discouragement.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.850
Hoping in Jehovah.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.850
Proverbs 24 10 says,

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:26.850
If you become discouraged in the day of distress, your strength or power will be meager.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:32.850
So being overly discouraged can interfere with our ability to receive power from Jehovah.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:39.850
But if we carefully throw our burden on Jehovah, we rise above that situation.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.850
We put complete hope in Jehovah that he's going to help us.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.850
And any problems we have sooner or later will be eliminated.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.850
We can receive power.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.850
Open up to Isaiah 40.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.850
And here's a scripture in this vein.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.850
Isaiah 40 verse 31.

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:03.850
But those hoping in Jehovah will regain power.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.850
They will soar on wings like eagles.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.850
They will run and not grow weary.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.850
They will walk and not tire out.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.850
Well, let's move to our third example.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.850
Being double or half-hearted.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.850
Being whole-hearted.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:23.850
Figuratively, Psalm 122 and 119, 113,

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:29.850
talks about half-hearted, double-hearted, person.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.850
And Jehovah hates them according to the Bible.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.850
Double-hearted trying to serve two masters.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:40.850
Trying, for example, to use the world to the full, but also be a servant of Jehovah.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.850
Half-hearted person.

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.850
Lacks, enthusiasm, zeal, these lukewarm in his service.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:51.850
Well, Jehovah indicates such individuals will receive no power from him.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:56.850
But do you remember what 2 Chronicles 16 verse 9 says?

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:05.850
For the eyes of Jehovah are roving about through all the earth to show his strength or power.

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:10.850
And behalf of those whose heart is complete toward him.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.850
Well, let's get our last example.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.850
Bad conduct, sacred service.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:25.850
Ephesians 4, 25 through 29, encourages us not to steal, not to be deceptive,

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.850
not to let a rotten saying come out of our mouth and so forth.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.850
And then interestingly, the next verse, verse 30, says,

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:36.850
do not be grieving God's Holy Spirit.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:42.850
So clearly, Jehovah is making it obvious that any of that kind of conduct

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:47.850
grieves, restricts, limits, our ability to receive Holy Spirit,

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:51.850
which is one of the main ways Jehovah provides power to us.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:08:02.850
In contrast, Hebrews 4, 12 says, the Word of God is alive and exerts power when we read it and meditate on it, we get power.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:10.850
Acts talk about how the disciples sublocated and they received Holy Spirit.

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:13.850
It talks about how they were all gathered together.

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.850
They were filled with Holy Spirit.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:25.850
Jesus said that you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you and you will be witnesses of me to the most distant part of the earth.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:34.850
So when we pray, supplicate, we read and meditate on God's Word, we meet together, we witness about the kingdom.

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:38.850
We receive power by means of the Holy Spirit.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:46.850
So summing up our discussion, if we maintain strong faith, not doubting it all,

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:51.850
to resist discouragement by hoping in Jehovah.

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:58.850
Three, refuse to develop a half or double heart, but keep a complete heart in serving Jehovah.

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:05.850
And four, we really work hard to avoid bad conduct, but zealously pursue sacred service.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:13.850
Then we will continue to tap into Jehovah's limitless power beyond what is normal

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:18.850
and despite the power of our great enemies, we will triumph over them.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:27.850
And your dear brothers and sisters will make it into the new world, either by means of the overland passageway.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:36.850
Through the great tribulation, never died all, or by means of the underground tunnel, the resurrection provision.
