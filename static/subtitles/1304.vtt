00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Around the world, large shipping branches can receive

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
literature requests from over 15,000 congregations a month.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
When you consider the number of publications and languages

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
in which these publications are available,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
filling these requests could seem daunting.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So how have we adapted to meet this ever-growing demand?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
For decades, large conveyor systems were iconic

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
of our shipping departments.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Literature requests moved along belts and were packaged

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
by brothers and sisters.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
However, conveyors operated only as fast as a slowest worker

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and could not expand easily for growth in additional languages.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So, in 2010, the governing body approved a new

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
shipping arrangement called Pick to Cart.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
At first glance, a picking cart might seem

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
a bit old-fashioned compared to the conveyor system.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
However, a closer look reveals a different story.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Once a congregation request is ready to be filled,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
a computer program, which was prepared by our brothers,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
calculates and assigns all of the publications

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
to a specific number of cartons.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It stipulates which carton size to use,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
where the carton should be placed on the cart,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and which palette it will eventually land on.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
How does this information get to the person filling the request?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
By means of a wireless network,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
information appears on a computer arm terminal

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
worn by each worker.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Additionally, address labels with barcodes

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
are printed for each carton.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Cartons are placed on a cart,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
according to the direction shown on the arm terminal.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Then, by means of barcode scanning,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
the setup of the cart is verified for accuracy.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The arm terminal directs our brother or sister

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
to the correct pick location,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
displays the quantity needed for each item,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and even indicates which box to put the item in.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
The barcode on the cart is then scanned for verification,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
or possible errors.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Once all of the items are verified,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
packing lists are generated automatically.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Barcode scanning verifies the packing list

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
are placed into the correct carton,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and palettes are prepared for shipment to the congregations.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
The picture cart software monitors each pick

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
from each picking location.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
When needed, the software automatically sends

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
an electronic request to replenish the shells with new literature,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
so that the worker always has literature available

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.439
to fill congregation requests.

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:38.439
The nine branches currently using

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:41.439
picture cart have already experienced many benefits.

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:43.439
One is speed.

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.439
With the use of carts,

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:48.439
individuals can move separately at their own pace.

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:52.439
This has resulted in approximately 100 fewer workers

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:55.439
in branches using picture cart around the world.

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:57.439
Compared to other technologies,

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.439
the installation of the picture cart system is inexpensive

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:04.439
and can easily be expanded to support additional publications

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:06.439
and languages.

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:08.439
Previously, in many branches,

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:11.439
each carton had to be double-checked manually before sealing.

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:13.439
However, this step is now eliminated

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:17.439
because of the accuracy of barcode scanning.

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:21.439
The picture cart process has simplified

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.439
and unified shipping operations worldwide.

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:26.439
Most importantly,

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.439
it fills a vital role in ensuring

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:30.439
that our brothers and sisters in the congregations

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:33.439
receive the exact literature that they request

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:35.439
for use in their preaching work.

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:37.439
The publications put into these carts

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:40.439
are reaching hearts all over the world.

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:44.439
You can call it from cart to heart.
