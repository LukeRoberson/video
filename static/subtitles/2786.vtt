00:00:04.179 --> 00:00:10.179
In Paradise, everyone is happy, they have fun, and it's a very beautiful place.

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:18.179
You can live forever in Paradise, so you can become friends with everyone from all over the world and become one big family.

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:26.179
In Paradise, there are mountains, forests, rivers, lots of flowers.

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.179
And you can hear people singing and laughing.

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.179
It's exciting!

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:38.259
You can't really go near animals and play with them now.

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:47.079
But in Paradise, they won't hurt you or try to bite you so you can play with them and have fun.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:53.380
I want to have a race with the Cheetos in the Paradise.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.380
In Paradise, Satan will be no more.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.380
So fun will continue forever.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:07.379
The meek will possess the earth, and they will find exclusive delight in the abundance of peace.

00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:10.379
Now, I can recite the scripture by heart.

00:01:10.379 --> 00:01:15.909
Right now, there are a lot of disasters and crimes.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.909
But in Paradise, there are going to be lots of good and happy things.

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.859
There will be smiles everywhere.

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:33.040
Sophia was imagining that she was in a garden full of butterflies.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.040
And Sophia's imagination about Paradise.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.040
She saw the little Israelite girl that worked in Newman's house.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.040
And she played with a lot of different butterflies.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:53.019
Kiloban Sophia's dad said that it's good to picture yourself in Paradise.

00:01:53.019 --> 00:01:56.019
Because you can rejoice in the hope.

00:01:56.019 --> 00:02:01.019
By thinking about myself in the beautiful Paradise, I can be patient during hard times.

00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:09.939
I want to live with my family and animals in a tree house with a swing and a slide.

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:16.939
Here in Paradise, birds are singing happily.

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:18.939
This is me and my family.

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:26.800
I want to meet David.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.800
It's because I want to know why he had so much trust in Jehovah and how he could be so courageous.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:44.349
I want to meet resurrected Daniel in Paradise and ask him how he felt when he was throwing to the lion's pit.

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.349
Jehovah promises so many fun and happy things.

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:56.169
I think he is a kind God.

00:02:56.169 --> 00:03:00.169
Jehovah is really powerful and has a lot of wisdom.

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:02.169
And he is also kind.

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:06.860
I think he is just really great.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.860
Jehovah never lies.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.860
So all his birds come true and he is a very loving God.
