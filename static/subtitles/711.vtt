00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:07.980
While now we come to the principal talk of the graduation, it's going to be delivered

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.859
by a member of the governing body, brother Stephen Lett, and the very interesting thing

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:26.160
he has selected is, we can learn much from Peter.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:35.200
Dear Gilead students, let me ask you, who is your favorite Bible character?

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.359
While during Gilead, you've examined many Bible characters you've learned positive

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:43.640
and negative lessons from them.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.920
And perhaps your favorite character changed, remain the same, or now you have several

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.520
favorite Bible characters.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.799
But no matter who your favorite character is, during this talk, we're going to learn

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:07.519
some of the many lessons to be learned from the very interesting Bible character, Peter.

00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:14.640
Now first, let's learn some things we can learn about Jehovah in Jesus from Peter.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:22.760
One thing we definitely learn is that Jehovah in Jesus, allow for, in fact, apparently

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.319
relish different personalities among their servants.

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:33.200
Now to illustrate this, let's contrast the personality of Peter, with that of some of

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.239
the other apostles, open up to John chapter 20.

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:44.280
And here's a very interesting little scripture highlighting two different personalities.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:53.920
John chapter 20, verse 3, then Peter and the other disciple who would be John, set out

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.000
for the tomb.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.760
The two of them began running together, but the other disciple ran faster than Peter

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.159
and reached the tomb first.

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:12.000
Stooping forward, he saw the linen claws lying there, but he did not go in.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.879
Then Simon Peter also came following him, and he went into the tomb.

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.639
And he saw the linen claws lying there.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.639
So John looked inside Peter rushed inside.

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:30.800
Now here's another example.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:42.599
When the mob came to arrest Jesus in Gethsemane, John 1810 says Peter drew his sword and cut

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:48.120
the right ear of the slave of the high priest off.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.639
Now let's think about this.

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:52.639
Do you think that Peter was going for that right ear?

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:57.710
I mean, that would truly be impressive, wouldn't it?

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.830
To go for that right ear and precisely take it off.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.110
But remember, Peter was not a swordsman.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.310
He was a fisherman.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.710
Obviously, he was going for the man's head, wasn't he?

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.590
But he missed and took the ear off.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:23.110
But what an impetuous, you could say, personality he has there.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.110
Here's one more example.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.830
The resurrected Jesus is on the shore of the sea of Galilee.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.669
And the disciples are in the boat.

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:36.629
And John says that Peter, it is the Lord.

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:41.110
Well upon hearing this, Peter put his garment on and plunged into the sea.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.509
The other disciples came in the boat.

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:50.270
So notice, John spoke, Peter plunged.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.669
The other disciples came in the boat.

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:55.990
Peter came swimming.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.590
Very different personalities.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:04.509
But as we said, Jehovah and Jesus relished these different personalities among their servants.

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:06.789
But now what's the lesson for us?

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:14.750
Well in imitation of Jehovah and Jesus, we're obligated to have love for the whole association

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.949
of our brothers, 1 Peter 2, 17.

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:19.870
And whole means 100%.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.230
And that certainly includes those with very different personalities from ourself, ones

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:32.389
from different cultures and backgrounds, say, we're obligated to receive these ones

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:37.870
into our company, into our homes, into our hearts.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.310
Now you've done a lot of this the last five months, you Gilea's students.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.629
Well you want to keep doing this.

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:47.910
And of course all of us want to do this.

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:51.870
But now here's another thing we learn about Jehovah and Jesus from Peter.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.910
Jehovah and Jesus are very forgiving.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:03.949
Now let's think about Jesus words at Matthew 1033 in plain words.

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:09.550
And our publications have said probably plain Hebrew words it would have been.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:15.149
Jesus said, whoever dissones me before men,

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:20.149
I will disson him before my father who was in the heavens.

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:22.910
But not once, not twice, three times.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.670
Peter did it, didn't he?

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:30.110
But yet Jehovah and Jesus completely forgave him because he was truly repentant.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:36.149
In fact, to somewhat counterbalance what Peter had done, Jesus allowed Peter to reaffirm

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:39.589
his love for Jesus three times.

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:41.709
Well what's the lesson for us?

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:46.430
We must imitate Jehovah and Jesus and being very forgiving.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:54.509
In fact, Jehovah makes it clear that he will forgive us in direct proportion to how we forgive others.

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:57.829
If we don't forgive others, Jehovah won't forgive us.

00:05:57.829 --> 00:05:59.670
Where does that leave us?

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.709
Doomed.

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:04.430
But let's say we do forgive.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.350
But we're pretty tight.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.949
We're pretty stingiest, kind of hard to squeeze a little forgiveness out of us.

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:15.589
Well, the indication is, Jehovah put that same ruler on us that we put on others.

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:19.550
On the other hand, if we're very generous in forgiving,

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.629
now Jehovah can be very generous in forgiving us.

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:26.790
So if someone hurts you deeply, has sinned against you.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.310
Don't view this as a bad thing.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.269
View this as a big opportunity.

00:06:33.269 --> 00:06:38.750
You've got a big opportunity to get a lot of forgiveness from Jehovah.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:44.019
So cash in on that opportunity.

00:06:44.019 --> 00:06:48.100
But now in addition to what we can learn about Jehovah and Jesus from Peter,

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:53.459
there are many lessons positive and negative that we can learn from Peter himself.

00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:54.420
So let's do that.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.540
Now here's a negative lesson.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.779
At times, Peter spoke too quickly.

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:06.540
He had what has been called hoof and mouth disease.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:07.660
What is that?

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:09.500
Open mouth, insert foot.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.379
And some of us have the same problem, don't we?

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:14.459
But here's an example.

00:07:14.459 --> 00:07:20.500
In Matthew chapter 16, Jesus was explaining that he would have to go to Jerusalem,

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.819
suffer many things and be killed.

00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:26.220
Well, quickly, Peter spoke up.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.459
And he actually rebuked Jesus.

00:07:28.459 --> 00:07:33.540
If you can imagine that, he'd be kind to yourself, Lord.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:37.379
You will not have this happen to you at all.

00:07:37.379 --> 00:07:39.939
Hoof and mouth disease, wasn't it?

00:07:39.939 --> 00:07:49.180
Followed by, as you could expect, some correction, humiliation, get behind me, say 10.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:55.379
But the indication is that even though Peter had this problem, he overcame it.

00:07:55.379 --> 00:07:58.100
See, he overcame this several times.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.699
He spoke too quickly.

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:05.540
But first Peter 3.10, he was able to write with freeness of speech.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:10.420
We know, and he would have lived up to this, whoever would love life,

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:15.259
and see good days must guard his tongue.

00:08:15.259 --> 00:08:16.500
So he learned.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:20.259
It took time he learned, and just like we're all learning.

00:08:20.259 --> 00:08:22.300
But now, what's the lesson for us?

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.779
Well, it summed up nicely here in Proverbs chapter 18.

00:08:25.779 --> 00:08:26.660
Please go there.

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.740
Proverbs 18 verse 13.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:34.659
When anyone replies to a matter before he hears the facts,

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:38.419
it is foolish and humiliating.

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:46.500
So none of us can perfectly bridle our tongues, but we do well to try to restrain our lips,

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.940
at least until we've heard the facts.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.179
Now, here's another negative lesson.

00:08:52.179 --> 00:08:56.299
At times, Peter was overconfident.

00:08:56.299 --> 00:09:01.059
The most notorious example, Matthew chapter 26,

00:09:01.059 --> 00:09:05.860
although all the others are stumbled in connection with you,

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:11.659
I will never be stumbled, even if I should have to die with you.

00:09:11.659 --> 00:09:14.740
I will, by no means, disown you.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.019
Well, that was overconfidence, wasn't it?

00:09:17.019 --> 00:09:20.259
And that we know it was pride before the crash.

00:09:20.259 --> 00:09:22.580
Well, what was his problem?

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:28.460
He was relying at this point on himself, rather than Jehovah, see?

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:33.299
But again, the indication is very strong that he overcame that weakness.

00:09:33.299 --> 00:09:36.299
And later, he was able to write at first Peter 5.6,

00:09:36.299 --> 00:09:41.700
humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.899
So don't rely on yourself.

00:09:43.899 --> 00:09:47.100
Be humble under Jehovah's hand.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.899
Now, what's the lesson for us?

00:09:48.899 --> 00:09:53.580
Well, like we learned at our convention, the last talk on Saturday,

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:57.860
that true courage is not self-reliance.

00:09:57.899 --> 00:10:05.340
See, true courage must be based on modest reliance on Jehovah.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:09.059
When we lean ourselves or rely on ourselves,

00:10:09.059 --> 00:10:14.059
it's like leaning, you could say, on a rubber crutch.

00:10:14.059 --> 00:10:16.580
You ever lean on a rubber crutch?

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.620
You're going to fall, aren't you?

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:23.100
But Deuteronomy 32-4, Jehovah is the rock.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.899
If you lean on a rock, see, now you have something.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:30.139
So we learned that from Peter, don't rely on yourself,

00:10:30.139 --> 00:10:32.340
rely always on Jehovah.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.539
Now, here's one more negative lesson.

00:10:34.539 --> 00:10:39.299
At times, Peter was ensnared by fear of man.

00:10:39.299 --> 00:10:47.450
Or we could say in his most infamous example, fear of girl.

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:51.889
Interestingly, Matthew 26, Peter was sitting outside

00:10:51.889 --> 00:10:55.929
and a servant girl came up and said to him,

00:10:55.929 --> 00:10:59.529
you too were with Jesus the Galilean.

00:10:59.529 --> 00:11:01.490
But he denied it.

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:04.529
I do not know what you're talking about.

00:11:04.529 --> 00:11:08.009
He went out to the gatehouse, another girl noticed him.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:11.889
This man was with Jesus.

00:11:11.889 --> 00:11:16.090
Again, he denied it, even with an oath.

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:22.620
So his first two denials, you could say, fear of girl.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:26.259
But it is obviously clear.

00:11:26.259 --> 00:11:30.940
He truly overcame that weakness, that problem,

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:35.940
and he became an outspoken bold witness of Jehovah in Jesus.

00:11:37.059 --> 00:11:40.620
I think, for example, in Acts chapter 5,

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.940
where here, Peter and the other apostles

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.419
were in front of the Sanhedrin.

00:11:45.419 --> 00:11:48.379
The high priest said, we ordered you

00:11:48.379 --> 00:11:51.100
to quit teaching about this Jesus.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.940
Peter, we must obey God

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.259
as ruler than man.

00:11:57.259 --> 00:12:02.259
And furthermore, this Jesus, God has raised him from the dead.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:07.580
This one that you killed, wow.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.820
No fear of man there, I was there.

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:14.379
He obviously overcame this problem.

00:12:14.379 --> 00:12:16.500
Now, what's the lesson for us?

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:20.779
We want to do our utmost to never be ensnared

00:12:20.779 --> 00:12:26.929
by fear of men, women, or girls.

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:28.769
And of course, always remembering

00:12:28.769 --> 00:12:31.809
is Jehovah's rating of us that counts will help us.

00:12:31.809 --> 00:12:35.730
The humans can't add five seconds to our life, can they?

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:39.970
Jehovah can add or subtract eternity.

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:42.730
But now, we're going to move to some positive lessons

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:44.210
we can learn from Peter.

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:48.330
And by far, his positive qualities outweigh

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.649
the negative qualities that he displayed at times.

00:12:51.649 --> 00:12:53.090
Now, here's one.

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:57.450
Peter waited on Jehovah.

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:01.850
And a wonderful example of this in John chapter six.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:05.809
Jesus had stated that unless you eat my flesh,

00:13:05.809 --> 00:13:10.169
drink my blood, you will not have everlasting life.

00:13:10.169 --> 00:13:14.129
And the Bible says that many of the disciples were shocked,

00:13:14.129 --> 00:13:17.250
they were stumbled, they quit following Jesus.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:20.929
And Jesus said to Peter, do you want to leave also Peter?

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:23.450
Do you remember those beautiful words

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:28.450
coming out of Peter's mouth, Lord, whom shall we go away to?

00:13:30.129 --> 00:13:33.289
You have the sayings of everlasting life.

00:13:33.289 --> 00:13:34.690
Now, if you think about it,

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:37.450
Peter didn't understand Jesus' words at this point

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:38.809
any more than the rest did.

00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:42.250
But he was willing to wait on Jehovah

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:44.129
for further enlightenment.

00:13:44.129 --> 00:13:48.009
And in time, he learned that those words have to be understood

00:13:48.009 --> 00:13:52.009
figuratively, that we have to exercise faith

00:13:52.009 --> 00:13:54.649
in Jesus' flesh and blood.

00:13:54.649 --> 00:13:56.529
Well, what's the lesson for us?

00:13:56.529 --> 00:14:01.809
Like Peter, we must show a waiting attitude

00:14:01.809 --> 00:14:04.009
for the God of our salvation.

00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:06.210
Micah chapter seven, verse seven.

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:07.809
Now, here's just a few examples.

00:14:07.809 --> 00:14:09.009
Are we willing to wait?

00:14:09.009 --> 00:14:11.529
And this was touched on earlier in our program,

00:14:11.529 --> 00:14:14.649
willing to wait with the right attitude

00:14:14.649 --> 00:14:19.649
for any theocratic appointment or privilege of service.

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:22.330
Here's another example.

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:26.610
Are we willing to wait uncomplaningly on Jehovah

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:31.090
to correct in his way, his time any injustice

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:34.970
that we perceive in the congregation?

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:36.090
Or what about this?

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:38.409
Are we willing to wait patiently,

00:14:38.409 --> 00:14:41.289
and this could apply to some of the single ones?

00:14:41.289 --> 00:14:43.809
Are you willing to wait patiently on Jehovah

00:14:43.809 --> 00:14:46.889
to provide you a suitable marriage mate,

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:50.090
even if you have to wait to the new world?

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:55.769
Yes, like Peter, let's have a waiting attitude.

00:14:55.769 --> 00:14:58.490
Now, here's another positive lesson for Peter.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:01.610
In order to make progress spiritually,

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:06.289
he was willing to move out of his comfort zones.

00:15:06.289 --> 00:15:08.169
Now, let's get some examples.

00:15:08.169 --> 00:15:12.210
When invited, he promptly left a life of pursuing material

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:17.210
things for a life of storing up treasure in heaven.

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:21.970
And apparently he was an older man when he did this.

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.649
But he did not put financial security ahead

00:15:24.649 --> 00:15:27.049
of following the Christ.

00:15:27.049 --> 00:15:28.409
Or here's another example.

00:15:28.409 --> 00:15:31.929
He went from being an unlettered ordinary fisherman,

00:15:31.929 --> 00:15:36.409
probably talking primarily to hard men and fish merchants

00:15:36.409 --> 00:15:39.929
to be hang a bold witness

00:15:39.929 --> 00:15:44.929
of an unpopular message before thousands.

00:15:45.009 --> 00:15:46.210
One more example.

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:50.850
He went from being very prejudice against Samaritans

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:55.850
and Gentiles to truly loving his Samaritan and Gentile brothers.

00:15:58.889 --> 00:16:00.289
Well, what's the lesson for us?

00:16:00.289 --> 00:16:03.610
Are we willing to move out of our comfort zones

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:05.129
in order to make spiritual progress?

00:16:05.129 --> 00:16:08.370
Now, all of you, you know where your comfort zones are.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.570
But are you willing to move out

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:14.169
in order to make spiritual progress?

00:16:14.169 --> 00:16:16.169
What about in some cases,

00:16:16.169 --> 00:16:18.409
especially if you're given an assignment,

00:16:18.409 --> 00:16:20.889
willing to go where the need is greater?

00:16:20.889 --> 00:16:23.169
Where Jehovah wants you to go?

00:16:23.169 --> 00:16:26.330
Or what about reaching out for various forms of the ministry

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:29.529
that you may not right now feel so comfortable with?

00:16:29.529 --> 00:16:33.210
Maybe public witnessing or working business territory?

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:38.049
What about being more courageous and informal witnessing?

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:42.850
Even though you may be a quiet and shy type person.

00:16:44.009 --> 00:16:47.049
Well, let's get another positive lesson from Peter.

00:16:47.049 --> 00:16:52.049
He allowed discipline to mold rather than stumble him.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:58.450
Of all the apostles, he was the most outspoken, wasn't he?

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:00.889
Well, that was matched by his being

00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:02.649
the most frequently corrected.

00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:06.690
Reproved, rebuked.

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:10.690
But beautifully, he didn't quit.

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:12.210
He never gave up, did he?

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:13.769
For example, we touched on before

00:17:13.769 --> 00:17:16.569
when Jesus said, get behind me, Satan.

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:20.170
We don't read that he pouted for weeks or months

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:22.769
because of that strong correction.

00:17:22.769 --> 00:17:25.930
In fact, the Bible indicates six days later.

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:29.930
Jesus took Peter, James and John up into a mountain

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:32.170
to experience the transfiguration.

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:35.930
Or what about after Peter denied Jesus?

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:39.890
The Bible tells us Jesus looks straight at Peter

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:42.089
in effect indirect discipline.

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:45.329
Peter recall what Jesus said.

00:17:45.329 --> 00:17:48.890
He went outside and he wept bitterly.

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:52.569
But yet you don't read it, he kept beating himself.

00:17:52.569 --> 00:17:55.809
He kept being depressed over a serious sin

00:17:55.809 --> 00:17:57.690
of denying Jesus.

00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:00.690
He knew Joseph and Jesus had forgiven him.

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:02.890
So he put it behind him, didn't he?

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:04.529
And he moved ahead.

00:18:04.529 --> 00:18:09.529
Well, the lesson for us, Jehovah disciplines, those he lost.

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:13.730
But don't ever let that discipline harden or imbiter you.

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:18.009
Let it soften you into a better person.

00:18:18.009 --> 00:18:20.049
If we've committed sins in the past,

00:18:20.049 --> 00:18:23.049
even serious sins like Peter,

00:18:23.049 --> 00:18:27.329
let's put them behind us and move ahead.

00:18:27.329 --> 00:18:30.210
Well, one more positive lesson we're gonna talk about

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:31.690
from Peter.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:36.690
He gained and then he maintained true humility.

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:41.690
Now it's true, he had to really work hard to gain it, didn't he?

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:44.609
He had to work at it because he and the other apostles

00:18:44.609 --> 00:18:48.890
had been taught from infancy to strive to be the greatest.

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:52.089
Seek prominence, see it was really indoctrinated

00:18:52.089 --> 00:18:56.809
into their minds and heart, see and up until the very last night

00:18:56.809 --> 00:18:59.009
of Jesus' life on the earth.

00:18:59.009 --> 00:19:00.329
Peter still had a problem, didn't he?

00:19:00.329 --> 00:19:03.690
And the other apostles too, he had a problem.

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:06.089
Jesus was washing the feet.

00:19:06.089 --> 00:19:11.089
John chapter 13, Peter had not volunteered to do this,

00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:15.049
even after Jesus started washing the feet.

00:19:15.049 --> 00:19:16.210
You ever thought about that?

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:18.250
Sometimes you don't think of something.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:20.609
Someone else starts doing it and you think,

00:19:20.609 --> 00:19:22.650
oh, well, let me help you with that.

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:26.849
Did Peter say, oh, Lord, I see you're washing these feet here.

00:19:26.849 --> 00:19:28.569
Let me help you.

00:19:28.569 --> 00:19:32.259
Let me catch a couple of feet for you.

00:19:32.259 --> 00:19:36.579
No, he, or none of the apostles, see volunteer,

00:19:36.579 --> 00:19:39.220
they still had a problem at this point.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.460
But would Jehovah's help?

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:45.220
An effort on his part in time,

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:47.619
he truly developed true humility.

00:19:47.619 --> 00:19:51.019
He went from that one striving to be the greatest

00:19:51.019 --> 00:19:55.259
to the humbled man who lifted up Cornelius

00:19:55.259 --> 00:19:57.819
when Cornelius tried to bow down to him.

00:19:57.819 --> 00:20:00.740
Remember that accountant, Acts chapter 10,

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:04.960
Peter lifted him up saying, rise,

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.660
I too am just a man.

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:11.019
Or what about his genuine humility

00:20:11.019 --> 00:20:14.700
when the apostle Paul corrected him publicly

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.220
in front of the whole congregation?

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.539
Now if he would have still had pride,

00:20:18.539 --> 00:20:22.859
well, who you, Paul, to give me correction?

00:20:22.859 --> 00:20:25.420
I've been in the truth a lot longer than you have.

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:27.619
When you were persecuting the Christians,

00:20:27.619 --> 00:20:29.859
I was an apostle.

00:20:29.859 --> 00:20:33.539
And furthermore, you could have at least talked to me privately,

00:20:33.539 --> 00:20:36.299
not in front of the whole congregation.

00:20:36.299 --> 00:20:40.180
But no, he knew he was clearly wrong.

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.700
He deserved the counsel, no matter how it was given,

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:47.700
he made the correction, and he harbored no grudge.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:51.140
And the indication is very powerful

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:55.900
that he remained humble despite his many privileges.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:58.059
Looking back over his life,

00:20:58.059 --> 00:21:00.619
he had had many, many privileges.

00:21:00.619 --> 00:21:06.930
In that true, he walked on water, at least for a few minutes.

00:21:07.049 --> 00:21:10.170
He saw Jesus transfigured.

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:11.890
He performed many miracles,

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:15.089
including personally resurrecting Dorcas.

00:21:15.089 --> 00:21:18.730
He received and used the keys to the kingdom.

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:21.089
He helped many people into the truth.

00:21:21.089 --> 00:21:23.930
But yet he remained truly humble

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:26.769
and could write with freeness of speech.

00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:28.849
In his inspired letter,

00:21:28.849 --> 00:21:31.809
first Peter chapter five and verse five,

00:21:31.809 --> 00:21:35.089
these beautiful words that we read very often,

00:21:35.089 --> 00:21:37.890
he said, but all of you,

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:42.890
clothe yourselves with humility toward one another

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:47.450
because God opposes the haunting ones,

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:52.009
but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones.

00:21:52.009 --> 00:21:54.490
And where is Peter right now?

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:59.490
An immortal spirit serving as one of the 12 foundation stones

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:03.490
of the Messianic kingdom.

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:06.569
So what is the lesson for us?

00:22:06.569 --> 00:22:10.890
We must gain true humility, like Peter did.

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:12.089
Otherwise, if you think about it,

00:22:12.089 --> 00:22:15.529
we're absolutely unusable by Jehovah.

00:22:15.529 --> 00:22:18.970
And then we must remain humble,

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:23.490
no matter what privileges we may or may not receive.

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:27.410
And then Jehovah will never oppose it.

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:32.410
Rather, we will continue to receive undeserved kindness from him.

00:22:33.529 --> 00:22:38.250
Well, our discussion is highlighted just a few

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:41.329
of the many lessons to be learned from Peter.

00:22:41.329 --> 00:22:45.130
I'm sure a few Gilead students soon to be graduates,

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:48.049
make Peter a study project.

00:22:48.049 --> 00:22:51.970
You could learn many, many more valuable lessons.

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:55.769
And of course, that's true of many other Bible characters.

00:22:55.769 --> 00:22:59.890
But unquestionably, there is so much to learn

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:04.890
from the faithful, colorful human apostle Peter.

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:15.259
So now we come to the point where we're going to make

00:23:15.259 --> 00:23:17.099
the presentation of the diplomas

00:23:17.099 --> 00:23:20.460
and brother Ronald Cousin is with me here.

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:21.980
Let's start please brother Ronald.

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:24.500

00:26:48.519 --> 00:26:59.240
Brother and sister Petrov will be returning to Croatia.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:10.039
Brother and sister Razif and Salama will be returning to Madagascar.

00:27:10.039 --> 00:27:19.849
Brother and sister Rian Kiddikul will be returning to Thailand.

00:27:19.849 --> 00:27:30.369
Brother and sister of Robert will be serving in Turkey.

00:27:30.369 --> 00:27:40.329
Brother and sister Schultz will be returning to Germany.

00:27:40.329 --> 00:27:49.369
Sister Shabra will be returning to Ghana.

00:27:49.369 --> 00:27:58.220
Brother Sersich will be returning to Croatia.

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:07.180
Brother Stevens will be returning to Asia.

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:17.140
Brother and sister Valmenos will be serving in France.

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:26.029
And Brother Yambao will be serving in India.

00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:38.539
And lastly, Brother and sister Yulee Huttala will be returning to Finland.

00:28:38.539 --> 00:28:41.099
Well, thank you very much, Brother Kursin.

00:28:41.099 --> 00:28:43.940
You did very well with those names.

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:47.339
Although you didn't have me worried, I thought we were sending brother let somewhere else.

00:28:47.339 --> 00:28:53.579
But anyway, I got over the shock.

00:28:53.579 --> 00:29:20.299
Well, we'd like to introduce to you now the graduates of the 145th class of Gilead.

00:29:20.299 --> 00:29:35.049
So at this point, we're going to have a class letter read to us by brother Krish Nadyo.

00:29:35.049 --> 00:29:36.450
It's amazing, are you?

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:41.319
Your friends can take your breath away.

00:29:41.319 --> 00:29:44.200
September 8th, 2018.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.799
To the governing body and the Bethel family.

00:29:47.799 --> 00:29:54.759
Dear brothers, five months ago, we arrived with excitement from the four corners of the earth.

00:29:54.759 --> 00:29:57.799
We anxiously waited to be molded into the people

00:29:57.799 --> 00:30:01.119
that our father Johova knew we could become.

00:30:01.119 --> 00:30:06.240
Despite denied visas, health issues and insecurities,

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.920
we were prepared to be taught by our grand instructor.

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:14.680
Even after enrollment, further challenges presented themselves.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:19.880
As a class, we fought measles, endured quarantine,

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:24.640
survived tornadoes, nursed broken bones,

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:28.200
and comforted each other in the face of the reedment.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:31.680
However, these hurdles did not hamper us.

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:37.240
They drew us closer together as siblings and to our father, Johova.

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:40.079
Isaiah gives us a glimpse into a heavenly school

00:30:40.079 --> 00:30:43.799
when he described the training Jesus was then receiving from Johova

00:30:43.799 --> 00:30:46.799
to prepare him for his earthly assignment.

00:30:46.799 --> 00:30:51.119
Isaiah 50 and verse 4 describes Jesus' special education saying,

00:30:51.119 --> 00:30:54.160
He awakens me morning by morning.

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:58.720
He awakens my ear to listen like the taught ones.

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:02.359
Jesus knew very well the purpose of his training

00:31:02.359 --> 00:31:07.519
so that he may know how to answer the tired one with the right word.

00:31:07.519 --> 00:31:10.039
Out of deep love and appreciation,

00:31:10.039 --> 00:31:13.359
he became the perfect reflection of his father.

00:31:13.359 --> 00:31:16.519
We too know very well the purpose of the loving training

00:31:16.519 --> 00:31:18.640
we have received here at Gilead.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:22.599
To answer the tired one, not out of our own thoughts,

00:31:22.599 --> 00:31:26.519
but with the words taught to us through God's word.

00:31:26.519 --> 00:31:28.480
Many in the brotherhood are like smoldering,

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:31.880
like a smoldering wick, and at times feel crushed in spirit.

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:34.599
Jesus loved and cared for such ones.

00:31:34.599 --> 00:31:37.839
We are determined to reflect the love Jesus developed

00:31:37.839 --> 00:31:41.440
through his schooling and bring true comfort and refreshment

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.240
to our brothers.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.279
Words fail to express the depth of our gratitude

00:31:46.279 --> 00:31:48.200
for all that has been done for us.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.680
The Bethel family welcomed us into their home

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:54.640
and showed hospitality to a degree that we never imagined.

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.119
Our dear instructors became like fathers,

00:31:57.119 --> 00:31:59.680
teaching us with grace and dignity.

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:04.079
They showed us how to honor one another through their example.

00:32:04.079 --> 00:32:07.240
They took the time to comfort us in the face of trials.

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.319
The winsome words we received through the curriculum

00:32:10.319 --> 00:32:12.519
were soothing oil on our souls,

00:32:12.519 --> 00:32:15.640
healing and strengthening us for the days ahead.

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:19.480
For this, we wish to deeply thank our instructors

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:23.160
as well as you dear brothers on the governing body.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.680
It is now clearer than ever to us

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:27.200
that Jehovah is using you mightily

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.759
in fulfilling your waiting assignment

00:32:28.759 --> 00:32:30.799
of overseeing the preaching work.

00:32:30.799 --> 00:32:33.960
Above all, we must thank our father, Jehovah,

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:36.440
from the bottom of our hearts for this precious

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.559
and unforgettable gift.

00:32:38.559 --> 00:32:42.720
Jehovah truly has given us more than super abundantly

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.039
beyond all the things we ask.

00:32:46.079 --> 00:32:49.000
At the end of this life defining experience,

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.559
we know our molding is far from complete.

00:32:52.559 --> 00:32:55.119
Our learning will continue.

00:32:55.119 --> 00:32:58.759
Our gratitude compels us to do our utmost

00:32:58.759 --> 00:33:01.680
to support you in all that we do.

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.359
Our hearts overflow with excitement

00:33:03.359 --> 00:33:05.720
to work harder than ever before.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.799
May Jehovah continue to reachly bless

00:33:07.799 --> 00:33:10.279
the marvelous provision of Gilead

00:33:10.279 --> 00:33:12.680
to the benefit of the worldwide brotherhood

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:16.599
and the praise and honor of our most wonderful God, Jehovah.

00:33:16.599 --> 00:33:27.299
Your brothers and sisters, the 145th Class of Gilead.

00:33:27.299 --> 00:33:29.299
Well, this is my opportunity to say

00:33:29.299 --> 00:33:32.220
just a few final words to you.

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:34.539
There have been so many wonderful points mentioned

00:33:34.539 --> 00:33:36.740
on our program today.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.180
You remember how we started with our discussion

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:43.099
about the need to always bring glory to Jehovah

00:33:43.099 --> 00:33:45.660
and not to be concerned about our own glory.

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:48.220
You remember we started off by mentioning

00:33:48.259 --> 00:33:50.579
that maybe it could be tempting

00:33:50.579 --> 00:33:53.740
to accept glory from others if they praise us.

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:55.339
But then on the other hand,

00:33:55.339 --> 00:33:58.460
if we get criticized that may also be tempting for us

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:00.619
to try and justify ourselves

00:34:00.619 --> 00:34:04.660
and inadvertently bring glory to ourselves.

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:06.500
But there is another way too

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:08.380
that we may have to be careful

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:11.619
about not bringing glory to ourselves.

00:34:11.619 --> 00:34:15.900
And we can see this from the example of the Apostle Paul.

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:18.019
Now, I know you didn't bring your bibles up,

00:34:18.019 --> 00:34:19.739
well, you have to do as listen.

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:24.059
It's one scripture, 1 Corinthians chapter two.

00:34:24.059 --> 00:34:26.340
1 Corinthians two, one and two.

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:29.940
And it's a vital lesson that we learned from the Apostle Paul.

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:33.659
He was speaking about when he went to Corinth.

00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:37.019
And as we realized, Corinth was a seat of learning,

00:34:37.019 --> 00:34:39.099
the Greeks loved learning.

00:34:39.099 --> 00:34:40.539
And what did he say?

00:34:40.539 --> 00:34:42.460
In verses one and two.

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:45.099
So when I came to you, brothers,

00:34:45.099 --> 00:34:49.139
I did not come with extravagant speech

00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:53.300
or wisdom declaring the sacred secret of God to you.

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:58.699
So Paul didn't use extravagant speech to impress people.

00:34:58.699 --> 00:34:59.940
He says in verse two,

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:03.820
for I decided, yes, he made a decision.

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:04.980
What was it?

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:08.260
I decided not to know anything among you

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:10.780
except Jesus Christ.

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:13.059
And then if we look at verse five,

00:35:13.059 --> 00:35:17.940
he says, so that your faith may be not in men's wisdom,

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:20.099
but in God's power.

00:35:20.099 --> 00:35:22.659
What a wonderful example Paul said

00:35:22.659 --> 00:35:24.980
with regard to not drawing attention

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:27.940
to his own wisdom and ability.

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:30.579
Even though some in Corinth, because of this,

00:35:30.579 --> 00:35:33.300
felt he wasn't a very good speaker.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:36.860
When we look at how Paul defended the good news

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:39.300
before audience is large and small,

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:43.579
he certainly was a very, very good author.

00:35:43.579 --> 00:35:44.940
He had that ability,

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:49.019
but he decided to tone it down

00:35:49.019 --> 00:35:51.900
because he knew the brothers there had a weakness.

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:55.139
Now what weaknesses were prevalent at that time?

00:35:55.139 --> 00:35:57.420
Well, among the Jewish people

00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:00.619
and there were some Jewish people there in Corinth as well,

00:36:00.619 --> 00:36:05.619
they loved to quote great rabbis and scholars.

00:36:05.619 --> 00:36:10.619
And of course, the Greeks loved to quote the philosophers.

00:36:10.619 --> 00:36:14.619
So what lesson do you think we learn from this?

00:36:14.619 --> 00:36:17.619
Well, as you go to your assignments,

00:36:17.619 --> 00:36:20.619
perhaps you might be tempted to say,

00:36:20.619 --> 00:36:27.619
oh, the instructor or a governing body member said this.

00:36:27.619 --> 00:36:34.000
But why should we follow the example of the apostle Paul?

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000
Well, you see, if we have something worthwhile

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000
to convey to the brothers and sisters,

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000
find that in God's word.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000
As you've been searching, look in the library,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000
watch our library, find something there,

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000
but don't rely upon the rabbis,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:56.000
the gurus, to show that you have some inside knowledge

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
that cannot be verified by other mere mortals,

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000
rather rely upon God's word.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000
Yes, rely on His word and the publications

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000
that we have through His organization.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000
And then that way you can be sure

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.000
you will bring glory to Jehovah and not to yourselves.
