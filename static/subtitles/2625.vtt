00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.969
Dad left us when I was around five years old.

00:00:06.969 --> 00:00:18.460
Then when I was 15, we found out Mum had cancer and she passed away six months later.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.460
She was only 39.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.460
My two younger brothers were still in elementary school.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.460
So I woke up early, did the milk rounds,

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.990
worked in a factory during the day and went to school at night.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.990
My life was super busy then.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:43.270
My life became significantly easier after marriage.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:49.899
Since my wife did the housework, all I needed to do was work.

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:57.020
Before I was so busy that I never really got to have any fun.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.020
One day, a friend took me to a betting shop for horse racing.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:10.540
And to my surprise, I got lucky.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:17.540
I was surprised that you can buy a ticket and then you get all this money in your hands.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:24.180
So that's how it started.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.180
It gradually became worse.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.180
To the point that I would get off the night shift and go straight to the races.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.180
I loved gambling more than eating and sleeping.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:46.060
On my way home, images of my wife and children would come to my mind.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.060
And I had this nagging feeling that I really should be getting my life together.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.060
When I was broke, I would go to the pawn shops.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.719
I pawned our camera and even my wife's jewelry.

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.719
My wife started studying the Bible.

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.719
And to try and make my wife and children a little happy,

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:11.719
I also agreed to a study.

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:19.860
Before I started gambling, I liked growing vegetables.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.860
You know, everything a vegetable needs.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.860
All the instructions to grow is in this tiny seed that is one or two millimeters in size.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.360
I knew that couldn't just happen by chance.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.360
I was convinced that there must be a God.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.360
Through my Bible study, I learned that this God is Jehovah.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.360
And that made me really happy.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.360
I found you. That's how I felt.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.360
However, it was really difficult to quit gambling.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.360
You know, many times I wanted to quit.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.360
And I would pay back my loans, but then take out some more again.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.360
My wife's relative said to me, only death can cure you.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.240
So I had this conviction that the Creator exists.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.240
And yet on the other hand, I was deep into gambling.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.240
I knew Jehovah saw it all and I hated myself.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.550
I attended a circuit assembly for the first time,

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:37.360
put away the old personality and put on the new personality.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.360
As I was reading those words from the Bible,

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.360
I felt that was about me.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.360
When I asked myself, hey, what's happening to my life right now?

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.360
I saw how horrible and ugly my mindset was.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.360
I felt tears well up.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.360
I knew this was Jehovah talking to me.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.360
And I felt determined to do something about it.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.830
I couldn't do it on my own.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.830
So I prayed to Jehovah from the bottom of my heart,

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:20.139
saying, I really want to stop, no matter what.

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.139
I want to hate gambling and not just avoid it.

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.139
Please give me this feeling of hate.

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:33.990
I prayed like this every day.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:41.699
Since then, I have felt zero desire to gamble.

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:47.019
There was one time during work when I passed by a racetrack.

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:52.019
I loved bicycle racing before, but now I felt this deep revulsion.

00:04:52.019 --> 00:05:05.649
I knew my prayers were answered.

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:11.649
I felt Jehovah's patience and so much appreciation

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:27.949
for how he allowed me in knowing who I was.

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:33.949
If I had continued that path, I'm sure my family would have broken apart.

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:38.899
My relatives are all surprised at me.

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:42.899
I'm sure those trying to stop gambling have many concerns,

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:46.899
but as long as you have that desire to pour out those feelings to Jehovah,

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:51.899
and jump into his arms, he'll take you in.

00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:53.899
He won't leave you.

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:58.899
I really want them to know Jehovah as that kind of person.
