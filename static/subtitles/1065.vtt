00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:08.679
Without warning, our faith could suddenly be tested by how we react in a violent encounter.

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:13.679
Yes, our faith may be tested as Enoch's was.

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.679
Ungodliness and violence were commonplace before the flood,

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:22.679
and the scriptures clearly indicate how people reacted.

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:27.679
We are told that the faithful man Enoch chose to walk with God.

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:33.679
So, when he was threatened, he looked to Jehovah for security.

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:37.679
On the other hand, Lamek, a descendant of the murderer Cain,

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:40.679
opted to provide his own security.

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:44.679
This led to killing a man and supposed self-defense.

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:50.679
Now, Enoch and the killer Lamek both lived in a violent world,

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:56.679
but their violence, reaction, plans were totally different.

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:02.679
As we descend deeper into the last days, people will become more desperate

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:06.680
and violence will only escalate.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.680
In the following dramatization, let's see how reacting to violence

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:43.329
could suddenly become a personal test of faith in Jehovah.

00:01:55.379 --> 00:02:00.379
My son barely escaped the gangs again.

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:12.780
We're the only ones without a gun want to keep a gun for protection.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.439
But how else can I protect my family?

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:26.610
In today's violent society, even in the perceived safest of neighborhoods,

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.610
we could have a similar experience.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.610
If so, how can we imitate Enoch's faith?

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.610
For one thing, he recognized a simple but fundamental truth.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.610
Jehovah hates violence.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:50.610
So for us to walk with God as Enoch did, we must reject violence as an option.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.610
What can help us to do that?

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.610
Don't harbor retaliatory thoughts.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:03.610
Violent thoughts can lead to violent actions without thinking about the consequences.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.610
Learn to recognize situations that could harm us,

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.610
then act to avoid the danger.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.610
That's the counsel given at Proverbs 22 and verse 3.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.780
The shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself,

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.780
but the inexperience keeps right on going and suffer the consequences.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.780
So we're encouraged to conceal ourselves if we sense danger.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.780
Think ahead, look around, be perceptive, and avoid situations

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.129
that may become violent.

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.129
Avoid violent entertainment.

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:47.129
Why?

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:53.129
It frequently portrays a violent response when a character's safety is threatened.

00:03:53.129 --> 00:04:03.129
All sorts of objects or weapons are depicted as strategies to kill or overpower the opponents.

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:08.129
While Christians may take reasonable steps to ensure their personal security,

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:13.129
they do so within the framework of Bible principles.

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:20.129
Consider these three scriptures as you make decisions about your family's security needs.

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:24.129
David prayed at Psalm 51-14,

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:28.129
save me from blood guilt.

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:31.129
He never wanted to be guilty of murder.

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:37.129
Preparing a response that includes the use of weapons could result in taking life.

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:43.129
If a Christian takes reasonable steps to defend himself or his property,

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:53.110
he would do everything in his power to avoid taking a human life and become blood guilty.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:01.110
In Matthew 2652, Jesus warned that those who draw the sword shall die by the sword.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.110
It's well established that when weapons are displayed,

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:11.740
situations usually escalate with tragic outcomes.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:17.740
Planning to use a deadly weapon could effectively dismiss Jehovah's spirit from our presence.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:25.740
To pull away from Jehovah is the last thing we want to do in a dangerous situation.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.740
A third is found at Ecclesiastes 918, where it simply says,

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.740
wisdom is better than weapons.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.740
In other words, being armed cannot match wisdom.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:45.740
The prudent course is to trust in Jehovah not weapons.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:54.740
God's word wisely teaches us to daily show respect, consideration, and genuine kindness to others.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:01.740
This approach of pursuing peace will often minimize otherwise potential conflicts.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:07.740
Isn't it true? Violence struggles often begin with a heated exchange of words.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:15.740
So calmness can often diffuse anger and deflect violent conflicts.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.740
Here's something else to consider.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:25.740
The Bible book of Jude says that Enoch prophesied to his opposers.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:31.740
His means that he was a preacher, being known as a courageous witness of Jehovah,

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:38.740
and showing compassion for those to whom we preach is always our best protection.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.740
How was Enoch rewarded for putting his faith in Jehovah?

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.740
Note the answer at Hebrews 11 and verse 5.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:56.490
By faith, Enoch was transferred so as not to see death,

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.490
and he was nowhere to be found because God had transferred him,

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:08.490
before he was transferred, he received the witness that he had pleased God well.

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:14.490
Enoch was rewarded with the knowledge that he had pleased God well,

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:21.490
in some manner, in a very clear way he was given assurance of Jehovah's approval.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:29.490
How comforting to know that if we face dangerous encounters with no good way out, like Enoch,

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:36.490
we too can handle that test of faith in a way that will please God well.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:46.269
In the following dramatization, note how our brother imitates Enoch's example.

00:07:46.269 --> 00:07:49.269
Hebrews 11, verse 1.

00:07:49.269 --> 00:07:53.269
Faith is the assured expectation of what is hope for.

00:07:53.269 --> 00:07:59.269
I do have faith in God's promises, but if a gun is what I need to protect my family,

00:07:59.269 --> 00:08:01.269
won't Jehovah understand?

00:08:01.269 --> 00:08:52.149
No, I couldn't do that. I'm not the first to face a violent world.

00:08:52.149 --> 00:08:55.149
Hebrews 11, verse 5.

00:08:55.149 --> 00:08:59.149
Receive the witness that he had pleased God well.

00:08:59.149 --> 00:09:04.149
Enoch lived among extreme violence, but he walked with God.

00:09:04.149 --> 00:09:11.860
I can imitate his faith.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:30.840
Did you notice this brother's violence reaction plan?

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:37.840
His faith in God's promises helped him to look to Jehovah for security instead of a gun.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:45.840
He realized he was not the first to face a violent world and made the firm decision to imitate the faith of Enoch.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:56.840
So now, prior to a violent confrontation, what can we do to be sure our reaction plan will be pleasing to Jehovah?

00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.840
Imitate Enoch in these four ways.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:08.840
Build our faith in confidence in Jehovah now before we are tested in a violent situation.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:24.840
Reject violent thoughts. Don't allow the violent movies or violent video games that are sponsored by the devil to train your children or yourselves on how to react in a violent confrontation.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:34.840
Reject the idea that you will prepare yourselves with weapons and fearlessly keep preaching as Enoch did.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:49.840
In this way, even if we find ourselves in a violent situation, our violence reaction plan will allow us to imitate Enoch and please God well.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:56.840
Brother John Echron, a helper to the coordinators committee will now consider the next talk of this symposium.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:03.840
Imitate the faithful, not the faithless, Noah, not his neighbors.
