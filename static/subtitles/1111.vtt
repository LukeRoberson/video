00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.089
I'm making a friend with God.

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:07.089
Yeah, I don't know how to do that.

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:10.089
Make a friend, but you've done fine with me.

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:12.089
But I can see you.

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:15.089
But God, a friend?

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.089
Seriously?

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:18.089
How about what you can see?

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:20.089
What does creation teach us about him?

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:21.089
Hmm.

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:23.089
Not much.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.089
Maybe evolve or your species dies?

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:28.089
It doesn't really help.

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:32.090
Well, I'm not talking about evolution.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.090
I'm talking about the things that God created.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.090
You don't suppose you've got a little workshop up there

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.090
building things one at a time, do you?

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.090
In the real world, things evolve.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.090
It's all random.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.090
I don't know what that tells me about him.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.090
I wasn't ready for this.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.090
Evolution isn't my strong suit.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:07.799
I need help.

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.799
This could be good.

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.799
Many who believe evolution.

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.799
Ancient tidal pool chemicals spontaneously assembled.

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.799
Too deep.

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:20.799
Wait.

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.799
Maybe what does the evidence reveal?

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.799
For a cell to survive DNA, RNA,

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.799
inanimate chemicals.

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.799
Probability.

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.799
I'm not sure this is what she needs.

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.799
Her real issue was getting to know someone she can't see.

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:50.909
That's the best place to begin.

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.909
One widespread false teaching,

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.909
robs people of hope,

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.909
implies that human life has no purpose.

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.909
This could be it.

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.909
Establish the positive.

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.909
What creation really says about Jehovah,

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.909
versus whatever evolution obscures.

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.909
Okay, so you got me thinking.

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:15.909
And I did some research.

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:16.909
Yeah.

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:18.909
And I think you're really like what I found.

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:19.909
Okay.

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:20.909
Come, come, sit down.

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:47.289
Okay.

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:53.229
I've tried everything to get J2 in meeting.

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:54.229
It's every Thursday and Sunday,

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:57.229
and I think you drew the intro yet.

00:02:57.229 --> 00:03:00.229
I can't promise anything.

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:02.229
It would be nice if you could come.

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:23.460
Have you tried bringing other people on the study?

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.439
Well, maybe not everything.

00:03:27.439 --> 00:04:03.389
What are you doing tomorrow after me?

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:05.389
I'm since I hear them.

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:07.389
You know that band?

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:08.389
Know them.

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:11.389
I used to see them all the time

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.389
before I'm a witness.

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:14.389
No way.

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:15.389
You like that kind of music?

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:29.420
You don't believe me?

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.420
Anything.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:37.670
Happy gay?

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.490
I was young.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.490
You were in a band.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:59.629
We have that vinyl.

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:01.629
So I'll be gone next week,

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:03.629
but I'll have someone else take care of the study.

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:04.629
Okay.

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:46.540
So how do we know that Jesus did not become king

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.540
when he was on earth,

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.540
or immediately after he was resurrected?

00:05:52.540 --> 00:06:01.259
Because he didn't.

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:07.110
Well, what did Jesus teach his disciples to pray?

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.110
Oh.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.110
Yeah.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.110
Well, I know the obvious.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.110
Let your kingdom come.

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.110
Implied future tents.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:22.220
But how come you know for sure what's going on in heaven?

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.220
Maybe it would help if we reviewed the cited scriptures here.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:31.769
Before you leave, a suggestion.

00:06:31.769 --> 00:06:34.769
Maybe you were to study ahead of time.

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:36.769
How about no?

00:06:36.769 --> 00:06:38.769
I'm really swamped.

00:06:38.769 --> 00:06:40.769
I know you're busy.

00:06:40.769 --> 00:06:41.769
We all are.

00:06:41.769 --> 00:06:43.769
You have no clue, do you?

00:06:43.769 --> 00:06:44.769
I gotta go.

00:06:44.769 --> 00:06:54.870
I didn't know what to do next.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.870
I thought she was making our study a priority,

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.870
but maybe she wasn't.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:35.220
It's dual die time.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:39.220
Then I remembered first Corinthians 3, verse 6,

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.220
that God keeps making it grow.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:54.750
So I asked him to help Jade.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.750
Then left it with him.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:23.850
Look, I need to apologize.

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:24.850
Forget it.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:26.850
You were stressed.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:28.850
Yeah, but there's more.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.850
Inside, I knew you were right.

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.850
It's just the last thing I wanted to stop.

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:35.850
Really?

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:41.049
How about I show you how I prepare?

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:54.659
Okay.
