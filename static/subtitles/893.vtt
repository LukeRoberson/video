00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:43.789
At the heart of the Middle East lie the lands where Jesus walked.

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:51.469
What lessons do they hold for our life today?

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:58.329
We thought we had a happy life, but when we learned the truth, the Jehovah showed us

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:06.189
that true happiness comes from serving him.

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:14.870
The brothers and sisters and men are always no distractions I have, but Jehovah does.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:21.230
He not only cares for our physical needs, he also cares for our feelings.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:28.549
We are pleased to announce the requirement will now be 600 hours per year.

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.310
He paved a way for me to be able to pioneer even though I thought that it would never

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.959
be possible.

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:45.439
The good news transforms lives, it gives us meaning.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.439
Where would we be without the good news?
