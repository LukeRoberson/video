00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:13.580
They gathered them together to the place that is called in Hebrew, Armageddon.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.679
Who are they?

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:20.379
Who is being gathered?

00:00:20.379 --> 00:00:25.339
And what is the significance of that to us as we go about our sacred service today?

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:32.780
The answers can be found in the context and invite you to find Revelation 16, and let's

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:47.700
begin reading in verse 13, which says, and I saw three unclean, inspired expressions that

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.899
looked like frogs.

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:55.100
Come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the wild beast and out of the

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:57.579
false prophet.

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:06.079
They are, in fact, expressions inspired by demons, and they perform signs, and they go

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:10.019
out to the kings of the entire inhabited earth to gather them together to the war of the

00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:14.060
great day of God, the Almighty.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:22.500
And verse 16 says, and they, these expressions gathered them, the kings of the entire inhabited

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.659
earth to the place that is called in Hebrew, Armageddon, expressions.

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:37.140
Now these must be very persuasive expressions, because they compel not just a few isolated

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.579
kings here and there, but the kings of the entire inhabited earth to the situation

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:45.659
called Armageddon.

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:53.500
Now these expressions, you notice, are unclean, so they cannot originate with Jehovah.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.459
And yet they are inspired, inspired by demons.

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:05.620
And yet they have their ultimate source in the mouth of the dragon, Satan, the devil,

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.579
the father of the lie.

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:12.979
But now who actually gives voice to these expressions?

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:19.340
And notice, in verse 13, that the expressions also come out of the mouths of the wild beast

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.139
and the false prophet, political entities of Satan's world.

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:29.259
So here we have unclean expressions inspired by demons originating with Satan but voiced,

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:37.699
repeated, parotid, echoed by people who constitute Satan's wicked world.

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:46.020
Now just what are these expressions that are so persuasive that they compel kings?

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:52.219
What concept would be so compelling?

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:58.860
Since 1914, Satan has been stepping up his efforts to mislead the entire inhabited

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.020
earth.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:07.500
And one of his goals is to deceive mankind into thinking that humans, that Satan's way

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.900
of ruling is the best, that humans can actually achieve peace and security through their

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.300
own systems and governments.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.219
Moreover, according to 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 verses 1 through 3, they will soon be

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:28.300
saying that they have actually achieved peace and security.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:35.340
Now adding to the power of these inspired expressions are the signs.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:42.500
The signs make it seem as if these expressions are actually coming true, perhaps that they

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:50.939
even have the backing of God, but the only God backing these particular inspired expressions

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:55.060
is the God of the system of things.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:04.419
Is it unprecedented that Satan the devil would use miracles in an attempt to lend credibility

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:10.300
to his ideas, his wicked lies?

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:17.740
Exodus chapter 7 verses 10 through 12, Jehovah empowers Aaron's rod to become a snake,

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:24.860
but Pharaoh's magic practicing priests mimicked that very sign.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.300
Likewise they mimicked the first and the second of the ten plagues.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.420
Okay, but what about after the Christian congregation came into existence?

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:39.819
Paul indicated at 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 verses 3 through 12 that the apostate movement,

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:46.180
which eventually gave birth to the clergy of Christendom, would be backed by, quote,

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:53.779
the operation of Satan, with every powerful work and lying signs and wonders.

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:56.540
2 Thessalonians 2.9

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:02.620
Jehovah Mark chapter 13 verse 22 says, in the prophecy of the last days, Jesus said,

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:09.740
more over false Christs and false prophets will arise and will perform signs and wonders

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.339
to lead astray if possible, even the chosen ones.

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:20.939
So clearly demons teach, and it is not beyond Satan and the demons to back up their false

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:25.060
claims with wonders at times.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.899
Although obviously their power in that regard is limited.

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:36.420
A subtle reminder of that fact is found at Revelation chapter 16 verse 14, which says that

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:41.259
they are gathered together to the place called Armageddon to the war of the great day of

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:43.980
God, the Almighty, the Almighty.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:51.420
Only Jehovah can hold that title, and that very word is a guarantee that Jehovah's will

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.980
will ultimately prevail.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:05.220
So is it possible that some professed Christians could start to believe expressions inspired

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.339
by demons that perform signs?

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:15.459
If it weren't possible, at least for individuals, then why would Revelation chapter 16 contain

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:16.459
this warning?

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:20.220
Right in the middle of the discussion about Armageddon that we just read, the verse that

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:27.939
we skipped, verse 16, contains a very relevant reminder for each and every one of us.

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:31.420
Now sometimes we skip it because we keep all the verses about Armageddon together, but

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:36.660
this is not an afterthought, a sidebar, just a wise saying, plunked in for no apparent

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.660
reason.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:38.860
It's totally relevant.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:39.860
Let's read it.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.220
Look, verse 15, I'm coming as a thief.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:52.220
Money is the one who stays awake and keeps his outer garments so that he may not walk naked

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.779
and people look upon his shamefulness.

00:06:56.779 --> 00:07:04.699
So here we are, right on the cusp of the outbreak of the great tribulation.

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:13.259
You have an identity, garments, an identity as a faithful witness of Jehovah God.

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:14.259
Keep your identity.

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:15.259
How?

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:16.740
By keeping awake spiritually.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.860
The article from which our text is taken entitled, Your Deliverance is Getting Near in the

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:26.740
July 15, 2015 issue with a watchtower points out in harmony with the Scriptures, boiling

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:31.500
down a number of scriptural facts that babble on the great will be destroyed.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:36.180
Then, the initial part of the great tribulation will be cut short.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:41.139
There will be a brief respite during which the majority of mankind will seek refuge

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:43.779
in human organizations.

00:07:43.779 --> 00:07:49.579
Our message of good news will change to one of judgment.

00:07:49.579 --> 00:07:56.459
Then the coalition of nations referred to as God of Megah will be bent on attacking Jehovah's

00:07:56.459 --> 00:08:01.019
anointed ones and their associates.

00:08:01.019 --> 00:08:08.779
Now only loyal love for Jehovah, obedient support of his anointed ones will get us through.

00:08:08.779 --> 00:08:11.660
That will mean everything.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.860
So what must we do now?

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.259
Stay awake.

00:08:16.259 --> 00:08:21.620
You have an identity, not just Bethelite, Gilead graduate.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:29.180
No, you've worked hard with Jehovah's help to establish an identity as a Christian worshiper

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.699
of Jehovah.

00:08:30.699 --> 00:08:32.179
Keep it.

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:35.620
Perform holy acts of conduct.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:43.899
We could say things we don't do, things we don't watch, things we don't read, things we

00:08:43.899 --> 00:08:48.379
don't think about, things we don't say.

00:08:48.379 --> 00:08:55.580
Don't let the demons tamper with your identity as a Christian with their unclean, inspired

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:56.899
expressions.

00:08:56.899 --> 00:08:58.940
Perform deeds of godly devotion.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:05.580
We could say things we do, preaching, lingering in prayer, continuing in your personal study.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:10.580
Much is covered in Gilead, yes, but not everything.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:15.220
The online study Bible is amazing, and it just keeps getting better day after day, helping

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:21.820
us to forge a closer bond, a close personal attachment with Jehovah, continued devoting

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:27.899
time to such deeds of godly devotion now, and you will succeed then.

00:09:27.899 --> 00:09:36.259
You will not be duped by the expressions that perform signs as others are.

00:09:36.259 --> 00:09:44.620
No, you will survive the great day of god, the Almighty, now so very near at hand.
