00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.620
Is it realistic to believe that you can be a friend with God?

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.900
If until now you've answered no to that question, please consider this.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.899
The lives of millions of people today prove that friendship with God is possible.

00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:21.699
Their lives prove that we can find a peaceful and meaningful life now,

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.339
as well as hope for a never-lasting and peaceful future.

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:29.379
If you desire that for yourself and others,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.020
we urge you to listen to this scriptural talk.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.140
We emphasize the need to listen, because many people ignore that important question,

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.500
that is, can you be a friend with God?

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:46.979
Why is it that many put such an important question out of their mind?

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.899
There are a number of reasons. For example, some believe that God is impersonal or

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.539
unknowable, or that He does not exist and that He's not interested in humans.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.939
They are taught that God is a mystery, and that He is cruel, harsh, and demanding.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.500
Many religious leaders claim that God will punish bad people forever in a place of torment.

00:01:11.379 --> 00:01:14.500
Do you feel drawn into friendship with a God like that?

00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:17.459
Who in their right mind would?

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.299
Still other people, after seeing all of the injustice and suffering in the world,

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.859
have concluded that God must be dead, or that He never existed at all.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.700
And then there are those who believe that they have done too many bad things in their life to

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:41.140
ever be a friend of God. Do any of those causes for doubt or concern apply to you?

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:48.500
If so, please listen carefully to the following four key points that may help you to see that

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.980
friendship with God is truly possible, we will then develop each one.

00:01:54.019 --> 00:02:01.620
First, we'll look at how sin separates us from God. Second, we'll look at how God has taken

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.379
the initiative to heal the breach and bring obedient humans back into friendship with Him.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.659
Then, we'll examine what we can do to become God's friend in an everlasting way.

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:21.379
And finally, we will consider how friendship with God brings peace now and in the future.

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:30.180
So, for our first point, what is it that separates us from God in a word sin?

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:40.500
Why does sin separate us? Because the true God is holy, he's pure, and his conduct is perfect.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:48.099
He does not have a trace of sin, he's clean and the highest sense. No human can be holy to that degree,

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:56.900
not even close. To illustrate, consider the words human and imperfect. They go together, don't they?

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.500
You cannot fully describe humans without mentioning imperfection. It's just a part of us,

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:06.740
and human history shows this to be sadly and painfully true.

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:14.020
So then, our sins or imperfections create a barrier between us and God.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:22.259
This separation is described at Isaiah chapter 59 and verse 2 where we are told in part.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:30.979
Your own errors have separated you from your God. Your sins have made him hide his face from you.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:40.580
Separated from God, it says, we were born into this state, but God did not create us to be sinful.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:47.780
Our sins are not his fault. The first humans, Adam and Eve, were created perfect,

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.580
but they proved to be ungrateful and selfish, and they rejected God's friendship.

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:00.979
They destroyed their peace with God by sinning against him, and they became his enemies.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:09.460
Adam then passed sin on to his descendants as well as death. We read about this terrible inheritance

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:19.379
at Romans chapter 5 and verse 12. In this verse, the Apostle Paul summarizes why our inherited

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:26.980
sinful condition leads to death. He wrote, that is why just as through one man sin entered into

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:35.779
the world and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because they had all sinned.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:48.019
Death spread to all men. This pandemic of sin has a 100% infection rate and a 100% mortality rate.

00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:55.379
No human can escape it. As Paul said, death spread because they had all sinned.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:03.540
On our own, we cannot correct our sinful state. It's as if we have fallen into a deep pit with

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:11.060
seemingly no way out. But are we left without hope? No. In fact, although God views some people as

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:19.060
his enemies, he treats others as his friends. For example, regarding the man Abraham, the Bible book

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:26.819
of James says in chapter 2 and verse 23, that Abraham put faith in Jehovah, and it was counted to

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:36.660
him as righteousness, and he came to be called Jehovah's Friend. Abraham was as imperfect as we are,

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:44.019
but he came to be called God's Friend. What has God done to make it possible for humans to gain

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:52.420
his favor and blessing? Simply put, our Creator has taken the initiative. He has taken steps to

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:58.339
heal the breach that was caused by sin and to eliminate the separation between us and him.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:06.420
How has he done this? First, the Holy Scriptures tell us that God desires for us to come to know him,

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:15.220
and to be at peace with him. In fact, he appeals to us to do this. In the Bible book of Acts chapter 17

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:23.060
and verse 27, we are told that God wants us to sincerely seek him, and that if we do, we will find

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:31.220
that he's not far off from each one of us. Next, and very important, God took the initiative to make

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:38.339
this possible by providing the sacrifice of his son Jesus in order to redeem us from sin.

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:47.379
That was an unparalleled act of love. As we now read first John chapter 4 and verse 10,

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:55.060
please think about what it says regarding this matchless act of love on God's part,

00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:01.060
and so that we may never forget that God took the initiative to heal the breach, so to speak.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:07.939
First, John 4, 10 says, the love is in this respect, not that we have loved God,

00:07:08.579 --> 00:07:16.420
but that he loved us and sent his son as a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:27.060
What did God do? God loved us, it says, and he sent his son. This sacrifice that God provided by

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:33.540
means of his son is called propitiatory because it can atone for our sins, and here is how it can

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:42.660
do so. What Jesus gave in sacrifice for us was equal to what Adam lost for us, that is a perfect

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:50.180
human life. Adam exchanged his perfect life for death by his rebellion against God.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:57.939
As mentioned earlier, Adam then passed sin onto his descendants, and he placed this on a path

00:07:57.939 --> 00:08:04.579
outside of God's friendship. On the other hand, the death of Jesus allowed for a ransom,

00:08:04.579 --> 00:08:10.180
or a means to satisfy God's justice so that we could receive back what Adam lost for us.

00:08:11.139 --> 00:08:18.339
That undeserved gift from God was given a great cost, clearly our creator wants us to come to know

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:26.339
and to enjoy a beautiful friendship with him. We should be very grateful that God took the necessary

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:35.220
step to close the gap and provide a way for us to become his friend. The next step involves

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:42.980
each of us, what is required of us, humility. We must be humble enough to accept God's gift.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:50.580
If we are humble, we'll see our need for God's mercy, and we'll then do our part to show

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:58.500
appreciation. The Bible book of Acts chapter 3 in verse 19 tells us that this involves repenting

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:05.059
and turning around. In other words, to receive God's gift, which includes his mercy,

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:12.019
we must adjust our thinking by repenting and then turn around by adjusting our conduct in

00:09:12.019 --> 00:09:18.179
course in life wherever necessary. The opportunity to do this is open to all people.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:24.500
As our creator, God is not partial in his mercy, and in the friendship he offers.

00:09:25.059 --> 00:09:31.940
He has kindly put everything in place for us. All we must do is be grateful and humble,

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:38.980
and then take the next step. That step involves accepting Jesus and his teachings.

00:09:39.779 --> 00:09:45.700
God requires that we follow the example of his son. How closely must we do so?

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.100
At John chapter 14 and verse 6, Jesus explained,

00:09:50.980 --> 00:10:00.259
I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. No one.

00:10:01.379 --> 00:10:07.220
So then to come into God's friendship, we must follow his son as true Christians.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:16.100
So far, we have reviewed how sin separated humans from God. Then we consider what God has done

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:22.500
to heal the breach or close the gap so that we can come back into his favor as his friends.

00:10:23.299 --> 00:10:28.740
Now let's look even further into what we must do, which brings us to the third key point.

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:35.299
How can a person become God's friend? We invite you to consider what is said at

00:10:35.299 --> 00:10:43.299
James chapter 4 and verse 8. If you have a copy of the Bible, we urge you to follow along.

00:10:43.299 --> 00:10:50.100
James chapter 4 and verse 8. As we read it, please notice first the invitation,

00:10:51.139 --> 00:10:56.899
then the response, and finally what we must do. It reads,

00:10:57.299 --> 00:11:26.100
So first what is the invitation? It is draw close to God. That is followed by what response on God's part. He will draw close to you. But for God to do this, what must we do to show that we accept his invitation? We must do this.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:33.299
We must cleanse and purify ourselves according to his standards. This will take effort.

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:44.019
For example, we must learn about his standards and we must come to appreciate that they are the best for us and then we must be determined to follow them.

00:11:45.059 --> 00:11:50.500
Above all, we do this because we want to please God and to be his friend.

00:11:50.899 --> 00:11:56.899
So then how can you develop a friendship with God, show initiative, and put forth the effort?

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:07.700
Consider this. If you have a house plant, you know that it doesn't grow on its own. You have to water it regularly and keep it in an environment that helps it to grow. True?

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:17.379
Something similar is true of our friendship with God. We nurture this friendship by reading and studying God's word the Bible.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:31.139
When we do so, we learn important things about God. For example, we learn that God's name is Jehovah. And as is true of any good friendship, it's important that we use his name.

00:12:32.019 --> 00:12:41.299
If we're sincere in our efforts to draw close to him, as we read at James chapter 4 and verse 8, Jehovah will draw close to us.

00:12:42.259 --> 00:12:52.899
And he never abandons his true friends. In fact, John 17 verse 3 tells us that coming to know God means everlasting life for us.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:59.620
What an undeserved kindness and priceless gift for Jehovah's true friends.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:09.139
So that you too can enjoy a bright future as God's friends, we warmly invite you to accept a free interactive Bible course

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:17.940
offered by Jehovah's Witnesses using the publication enjoy life forever. Here's what it looks like.

00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:24.580
Jehovah's Witnesses can help you to get either a printed or an electronic copy.

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:34.179
It begins with the lessons, how can the Bible help you, the Bible gives hope, and can you trust the Bible?

00:13:35.139 --> 00:13:42.980
We urge you to learn these things and to worship God in harmony with the truth that is revealed in his word.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:49.139
So what important points have we considered regarding how a person can become God's friend?

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:53.620
First, get to know God by reading and studying his word.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:14:02.419
Jesus said that doing this means everlasting life and then learn about God's name and use it.

00:14:03.379 --> 00:14:08.820
Now, we'll list four more things that those who desire to become God's friends must do.

00:14:09.539 --> 00:14:15.860
They are imitate God's qualities, reject thinking and actions that offend God,

00:14:16.659 --> 00:14:25.139
associate with those who want to be God's friends, and avoid friendship with people who ignore or mock God's standards.

00:14:26.019 --> 00:14:28.820
Now, a few things in that list speak for themselves, don't they?

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:36.899
Such as associate with those who want to be God's friend and avoid friendship with people who ignore or mock God's standards.

00:14:36.899 --> 00:14:41.539
That makes sense, doesn't it? Think back to our illustration about the house plant.

00:14:42.419 --> 00:14:49.059
You must not only water and nurture it, but you must keep it in the right environment, one that helps it to grow.

00:14:50.019 --> 00:14:56.740
Likewise, associating with those who also want to be God's friend is the right environment for us.

00:14:57.379 --> 00:15:01.220
But what about the requirement to imitate God's qualities?

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.019
How can an imperfect people do this?

00:15:04.019 --> 00:15:10.419
Well, for a few minutes, we'll look at just two of God's qualities and how we can imitate Him.

00:15:10.419 --> 00:15:13.700
And we begin with God's love.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:22.019
An important way that we can imitate God's love and become his friend is by applying what his son Jesus taught us.

00:15:22.659 --> 00:15:29.539
For example, Jesus said, just as you want men to do to you, do the same way to them.

00:15:30.659 --> 00:15:34.419
A simple statement, but one that takes effort to apply, true.

00:15:35.139 --> 00:15:36.899
Can we do this? Yes.

00:15:37.539 --> 00:15:42.899
And a person who desires to be God's friend will put forth the effort needed to do this.

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:49.779
To succeed in imitating God's love, we must try to see people as Jehovah sees them.

00:15:49.779 --> 00:15:55.139
We must try to put ourselves in the place of others so that we can understand their needs,

00:15:55.139 --> 00:15:58.340
their concerns, and even their pain of heart.

00:15:59.539 --> 00:16:03.860
Some may be challenged physically because of injury, disease, or aging.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:09.379
Others are coping with emotional trials because of depression or anxiety.

00:16:10.259 --> 00:16:13.620
Many people face difficulties that we have not experienced.

00:16:14.419 --> 00:16:18.820
For instance, a young person may find it hard to understand older people,

00:16:19.379 --> 00:16:24.179
and here she will really need to think about what it must be like to be an older person.

00:16:25.059 --> 00:16:28.899
If that is true of you, how can you imitate God's love?

00:16:30.019 --> 00:16:36.980
One important way is by listening carefully until you understand the other person's feelings.

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:41.700
When you do so, you are in a better position to imitate God's love.

00:16:42.659 --> 00:16:49.620
Those who desire to be Jehovah's friends will be moved to imitate his love by acting according

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.460
to what others really need.

00:16:52.259 --> 00:16:57.220
That brings us to a second and related quality that of kindness.

00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:02.019
Anyone who desires to be God's friend must be kind to others.

00:17:02.659 --> 00:17:06.420
Here again, we can learn much from what Jesus said and did.

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:12.819
God's son said that the most high is kind toward the unthankful and wicked.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:18.019
Jesus appreciated this outstanding quality of his heavenly Father,

00:17:18.019 --> 00:17:20.420
and he imitated God's kindness.

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:22.980
What helped Jesus to do so?

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:31.380
He treated people in a kind manner by anticipating how his words and actions might affect their feelings.

00:17:32.339 --> 00:17:37.140
For example, the Bible tells us that a woman known to be a sinner approached Jesus,

00:17:37.779 --> 00:17:41.059
weeping and wetting his feet with her tears.

00:17:42.099 --> 00:17:48.420
Jesus discerned that she was repentant, and he knew how heartbroken she would be if he just

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:55.059
dismissed her unkindly. Like his heavenly Father, Jesus looked for the good in her.

00:17:55.619 --> 00:18:00.819
We know this because he commended her, then he forgave her.

00:18:02.339 --> 00:18:07.140
Following Jesus' example, how can we also imitate God's kindness?

00:18:08.019 --> 00:18:12.259
We can do so by being gentle to all people whenever possible.

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:17.059
Kind people discern how to deal with delicate situations.

00:18:17.779 --> 00:18:20.980
Kind people avoid hurting the feelings of others.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:27.779
When we do this, we try to anticipate how our words and actions might affect them.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:32.579
That is how a true friend of God will treat others.

00:18:34.259 --> 00:18:40.019
Well, this review of just a few of Jehovah's many outstanding qualities gives us an idea

00:18:40.019 --> 00:18:46.180
of how much we can benefit from reading the Bible, and then applying its many lessons for us.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:53.619
Yes, friendship with God is possible, and we can imitate his outstanding qualities.

00:18:53.619 --> 00:19:02.099
In the following video, please take note of how we can use the Bible to build a friendship with God.

00:19:37.619 --> 00:19:39.779
Who has never known her father.

00:19:43.069 --> 00:19:47.150
All her life she has been told lies that her father abandoned her.

00:19:51.759 --> 00:19:56.000
But deep inside, she feels she knows it's not true.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:02.910
One day, she receives a letter from her father.

00:20:07.819 --> 00:20:14.140
She learns that he is alive, and that unbeknown to her, he had been reaching out to be part of

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:21.150
her life since the day she was born. The daughter learns who her father is.

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:53.519
And eventually, she finds him. They learn about one another and build a strong bond

00:20:54.319 --> 00:21:04.750
until they are inseparable friends. The Bible is like a group of letters from our heavenly father.

00:21:08.079 --> 00:21:15.039
As we read the Bible, we learn how to talk to God, how he responds,

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.599
and the many ways he shows his tender care.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:30.099
The Bible can help us to do something we may never have thought possible.

00:21:33.279 --> 00:21:34.799
Be God's friend.

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:41.519
That friendship starts by learning the name of your heavenly father and new friend,

00:21:42.319 --> 00:21:49.299
and God tells us his name. You whose name is Jehovah.

00:21:49.380 --> 00:22:01.740
Jehovah, you alone are the most high. Jehovah guarantees that if you draw close to him,

00:22:03.339 --> 00:22:05.259
he will draw close to you.

00:22:07.019 --> 00:22:12.220
Our loving father openly extends friendship to all who search for him.

00:22:14.369 --> 00:22:25.279

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:08.190
Future only. Friendship with God brings peace now. You can have a more peaceful and meaningful life

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:14.990
right now by becoming Jehovah's friends. When you become a friend of God, he will listen to your

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:22.190
prayers and extend his mercy to you. And when you sense his forgiveness, you will experience deep

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:30.109
seated joy. Psalm 32, 1 and 2 says in part, happy is the one whose transgression is pardoned,

00:23:30.109 --> 00:23:36.190
whose sin is covered. Happy is the man whom Jehovah does not charge with guilt.

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:45.390
What a blessing it is to sense Jehovah's forgiveness. God's forgiveness can free you from the burden

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:51.470
of guilt that you may feel because of past wrongs. This includes wrongs that you may have committed

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:58.750
before you came to know God and became his friend. Is such a thing possible for you? Yes, it is.

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:06.430
As our video pointed out, the Bible teaches us how to pray to God and how God responds to our prayers.

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:13.710
And you can be assured that he will listen to your prayers, including your prayers for his forgiveness

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:20.670
and his help. At Proverbs 1529, we read that Jehovah hears the prayers of the righteous.

00:24:21.549 --> 00:24:27.390
Who are the righteous? The righteous are those who strive to live by his requirements.

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:34.190
What a comfort for us to know that we can be God's friend because he sees what we are trying to do

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:42.829
and he listens to us. But there is more. Our friendship with God can also result in peace with other

00:24:42.829 --> 00:24:50.269
people. In fact, Jesus urged us to seek such peace with others. He said that we should love even our

00:24:50.269 --> 00:24:57.869
enemies and do good to others without hoping for anything back. And then we read at Luke 636 that he

00:24:57.869 --> 00:25:07.470
added, continue being merciful just as your father is merciful. Such a good example can touch

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:14.990
the hearts of others and move them to become Jehovah's friends as well. Consider the experience of

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:23.950
Jose, who learned how to love from true friends of God. At the age of 13, Jose was involved in

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:31.069
guerrilla warfare. He was taught to hate the people who were allegedly responsible for the injustices

00:25:31.069 --> 00:25:38.750
that he saw all around him. His aim was to eliminate those people. He saw many of his companions fall

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:46.589
in death and Jose became filled with feelings of bitterness and revenge. While making grenades or

00:25:46.589 --> 00:25:53.549
bombs, he would ask himself, why is there so much suffering? If there is a God, does he even notice?

00:25:54.509 --> 00:26:02.430
Many times, Jose wept. He was depressed and confused. Eventually, Jose came in contact with

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:08.829
the local congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses. At his first congregation meeting, he noticed the

00:26:08.829 --> 00:26:16.430
loving atmosphere there. Everyone greeted him in a warm and friendly manner. Later, a discussion on

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:23.309
the subject, why does God permit wickedness, provided answers to the very questions that he had been

00:26:23.309 --> 00:26:29.869
asking? As he learned more from the Bible, Jose made changes in his way of life and in his thinking.

00:26:30.509 --> 00:26:36.990
He learned to imitate God's love and thereby become his friend. Breaking his ties with his

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:42.190
companions, though, proved to be challenging. Every time he went to the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:49.390
Witnesses, he was followed. Some former associates even attended a few meetings, so as to understand

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:55.150
what brought about such a great change in Jose. But once they were satisfied that he was not a

00:26:55.150 --> 00:27:02.509
danger to them, they left him alone. At age 17, Jose was baptized as one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:10.269
As God's friend, Jose soon started sharing what he was learning full time. Instead of scheming to

00:27:10.269 --> 00:27:17.710
kill people, he could now share a message of love and of hope with them. What a great reward

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:24.750
for choosing to become Jehovah's Friend. Yes, even those who were once enemies can learn to be at

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:32.990
peace with one another and be God's friends. So what have we learned? We have reviewed why friendship

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:40.750
with God is realistic and possible for us. The Bible tells us that since ancient times, God has

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:47.630
called some humans his friends. We also looked at what God has done to heal the breach or close the

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:56.509
gap between us and him. How has he done so? By means of his Son. Through Jesus, Jehovah God

00:27:56.509 --> 00:28:03.309
provided the ransom sacrifice that was needed to redeem us from sin. Then we looked at what you

00:28:03.309 --> 00:28:09.390
must do to take advantage of God's mercy and become his friend. This includes studying his word

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:17.869
the Bible and then imitating his outstanding qualities. Finally, we considered how you can find a

00:28:17.869 --> 00:28:26.509
meaningful life now as well as true peace with others. Jehovah promises that his friends will

00:28:26.509 --> 00:28:35.630
receive eternal life in peace. If that is what you yearn for, then please accept our invitation to

00:28:36.269 --> 00:28:44.109
study the Bible with Jehovah's Witnesses. By doing so, you will learn about an unending future when

00:28:44.109 --> 00:28:51.630
anguish of heart is gone forever and an unending future in which God will permanently wipe away

00:28:51.630 --> 00:29:02.029
tears from the faces of his friends. That future is not only possible. It is the future that God promises.
