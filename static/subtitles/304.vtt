00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:14.009
Danny's gonna look after the business while we're away.

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.579
I only scheduled a few small jobs.

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:30.420
I'm sure he can handle it.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.420
It's our sign convention.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.420
And I planned as best I could for us to go together.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:43.000
But some things, you just can't see coming.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Hello?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Danny was in a panic.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
He got trouble calls from my two biggest accounts.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.100
It was bad.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:05.620
I can't lose their business.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.319
Okay, just find the parts and I'll call you back.

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:13.319
This will take all weekend.

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:15.319
You want us to go?

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:17.319
Will you get the program later?

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:18.319
Yeah.

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:21.319
And I'll have to text John that I can't be an attendant.

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:23.319
But what will I miss that I can't get later?

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:27.019
Hey, welcome, awesome.

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:30.019
Ingrid.

00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:40.540
In Hebrews 11 verse 26 it says,

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.540
Moses considered the reproach of the Christ

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.540
to be rich as greater than the treasures of Egypt.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.540
For he looked intently toward the payment of the reward.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:00.069
Of what value is being a prince of Egypt compared with me?

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:03.069
Honey, what do you think?

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:13.710
Danny?

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.710
Yeah, here's what I want you to do for now.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.710
We'll pick up the pieces when I get back.
