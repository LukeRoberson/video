00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:08.380
In the late 1950s, the opposition against Jehovah's Witnesses in the former Soviet Union resulted

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.699
in homes being searched, brothers being followed, and many of our brothers and sisters being

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:19.179
sent to communist concentration camps in Siberia among other places.

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:29.940
In 1956 and 1957, over 462,000 convention delegates worldwide unanimously adopted a petition,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.179
which clearly outlined the treatment Jehovah's Witnesses were enduring.

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:39.780
It was sent to the Soviet authorities, but sadly, not much changed.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.939
The next year, at the 1958 International Convention at Yankee Stadium in New York, a talk

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:50.179
was given entitled Behind the Iron Curtain.

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:54.619
During the talk, delegates were surprised when a recording of greetings and songs from

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:58.259
brothers and sisters in the Soviet Union was played.

00:00:58.259 --> 00:01:03.539
Despite the risk of losing their freedom, the brothers produced and sent these recordings.

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.700
Well, a few months ago, some of those who were involved in making the recording were able

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.980
to listen to it for the first time.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.140
Several of them found out only then that the recording had been played at the convention

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.420
at Yankee Stadium.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:38.930
Our team was present at that gathering.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.209
The brothers told us to prepare songs for a recording.

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:48.930
When we were singing, I never imagined that it was for a convention, because I did not

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.170
know about that.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.810
We sang as usual.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.450
The chorus was made up of about 20 persons, and the recording was made in a room, in a

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:07.489
barrack-like building.

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:12.569
I just looked after the chorus to give them the right tone.

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.650
If someone sang a little off-key, she would right away remark, halt us, you are off,

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:27.539
or tenor, you are off, so that there would be no slips, no mistakes.

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:32.500
We had to be very careful when we were recording.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.099
And so we knew not to talk.

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.259
I could not tell anyone about it.

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:45.270
It was secret, absolutely secret.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.189
We chose a brother who spoke very good Russian, who had good intonation, and who had a good voice.

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:58.789
And as I recall, we made the recording on our first attempt.

00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:02.430
Brother Yuri Dobicin said the greetings.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:35.939
As the brothers who made the recording told me, the most difficult assignment was to

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:42.539
get this recording across the border.

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:49.219
The brothers cut it up into pieces and sewed it into the lining of a jacket, because that's

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:53.460
how confidential letters were sent.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:04:00.060
One married couple from Poland, who were vacationing in Russia, agreed to take it back with them,

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.180
to take it out of the Soviet Union.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:12.030
And that's where they ran into serious problems.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:19.009
From Brother Scheider's letter, we received the audio recording in Poland.

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:23.730
The security officers separated our brother from the others.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.689
Then an officer said to him, please give us the film and the three letters you have with

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:31.290
you.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.170
The brother saw now, of course, that there had been a traitor somewhere.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.009
He and his wife were now thoroughly searched.

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:44.050
Every square centimeter of their cases was carefully examined together with their contents.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.649
Then both were stripped naked.

00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:51.250
While this was going on, they yelled at the brother, tell us where you have hidden everything

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.009
or to whom you have given it.

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:58.370
They were absolutely convinced that he had everything with him.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.529
Several times they took him to the office of the frontier police and to the security police,

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:08.129
pushing him again and again and being terribly angry.

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:11.129
But they finally had to give up.

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:17.850
They kept him back for 24 hours and questioned him in the presence of 10 specialists.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:25.019
But he came out victorious.

00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:31.660
Sadly, even the brothers who were involved don't know who this couple who brought the tape

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.860
into Poland was.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.899
And now we have yet a surprise for you, a message directly from our brothers in Russia to

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:40.899
this convention.

00:05:40.899 --> 00:06:13.540
And now we give you a part of their message to you in Russia.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:22.220
Dear brothers and sisters, we wish you all the best of luck in the history of our

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.220
country.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.819
You have gathered today in the international convention of the middle of the ego, we wish you

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:34.620
at least in several words to give you a brief message about our life and activities

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.819
on the territory of Russia.

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:42.300
Only thanks to the supreme God of the ego we can live and work hard.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.660
In the last period, in the end of the Second World War, the real time,

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:53.040
we have had a fairly difficult and difficult time fighting for the protection of faith and

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.819
eternity in this old world.

00:06:55.819 --> 00:07:01.660
However, due to all the difficulties, the law, the arrest, the repression, we were also

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.660
a lot of joy.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:08.819
The joy of our country was that many people in good health came to the recognition of their

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:18.610
interests and old friends, good friends, good friends and great-grandchildren.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:23.970
Well for me, it was of course a great joy, since the goal was reached after all.

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:28.930
Everything was so wonderful at that time, I really enjoyed it all.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.649
Nothing could describe the joy I felt.

00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:43.069
I was overwhelmed with feelings.
