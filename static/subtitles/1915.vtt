00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:08.900
Welcome. We're going to discuss the importance of setting personal goals in the ministry.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.660
But first, here are some updates.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:21.780
On January 1st of this year, a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck central Japan. Thankfully,

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:30.500
none of our brothers were killed. But over 100 of their homes were damaged, and two

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:40.179
were destroyed. Also, nine kingdom halls were damaged. The branch office quickly provided

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:46.100
accommodations and other necessities for our brothers and sisters. Soon after, the branch

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.340
appointed a disaster relief committee, and sent branch representatives to visit our brothers

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:59.140
in the affected areas. Within just a few days, additional relief aid was delivered to congregations

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.459
in need. In the Wajima congregation, the elders couldn't account for one sister.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.939
To reach her, an elder walked for eight hours avoiding landslides and cracks in the ground,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.459
until he was able to confirm that she was safe.

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:22.739
Congregations in the area, including those severely affected, have held their meetings from

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:28.260
the very weak the earthquake yet. Most of the publishers have gathered in person

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:35.299
to encourage one another. We're praying for our brothers and sisters in Japan and in other lands

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:43.780
affected by recent disasters. On January 1st, the Patterson Visitor Center officially opened for

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.819
tours. Construction began in early 2021 and was completed in September 2023.

00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:56.019
What will you experience when you come for a visit? Let's take a look.

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:08.620
The Patterson Visitor Center features three museums and a coin display.

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:17.300
The first exhibit you'll notice is entitled Defending and Legally Establishing the Good News.

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:23.060
It presents the powerful experiences of men, women, and even schoolchildren

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.419
who held to their Bible-based beliefs despite legal opposition.

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:31.699
This exhibit shows how Jehovah's Organization supported them through difficult tests.

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:38.979
A Biblical coin gallery presents a unique display of original coins that were in circulation

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:43.300
in the first century, along with their scriptural context and significance.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.659
Another exhibit, entitled All Your Sons Will Be Taught by Jehovah, features some of the training

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:55.699
programs and schools that have been used by Jehovah's Modern Day Organization to equip us as

00:02:55.699 --> 00:03:02.259
ministers and teachers. We trust it will motivate you to see additional ways that you can take

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:09.139
advantage of the education Jehovah provides. Our feature museum is a first-century Bible village.

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.539
The local villagers are very welcoming and will be eager to show you how they live and work

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:21.780
together as a community. You'll see firsthand what life was like when Jesus walked the Earth.

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:29.139
You'll walk through agricultural areas, a marketplace, residences, a synagogue,

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:37.139
and even by the seashore. No doubt these new museums will enhance your appreciation for the

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:45.169
Bible and for what Jehovah is accomplishing through his organization today. We welcome all who are

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:57.460
able to come and see the New Patterson Visitor Center. The Patterson Visitor Center is

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:04.659
outstanding. We thank all who worked on this project and we now invite all of you to come and tour.

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:13.939
You can request a tour on www.org. Now, let's talk about the recent adjustments to the way we

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:20.259
report our ministry and how these affect our personal goals. At the recent annual meeting,

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:26.339
we learned that as of last November, we had no longer be submitting a detailed field service

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:34.180
report. That was a big change, wasn't it? But although we've changed the way we report our activity,

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:42.660
we haven't changed the way we view the ministry itself. The focus is on people. We love people,

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.379
and we want to help them. We're ready to share the good news wherever we find them.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:54.980
On Saturday morning, we may spend a couple of hours preaching from door to door. Then we go grocery

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:01.459
shopping. Are we off the clock, so to speak, because we're no longer in the formal preaching work?

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:07.779
We don't look at it that way. When we're at the grocery store, we're still on the lookout for

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:13.540
people we can share the good news with. We may be able to talk to someone standing next to us

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:20.740
in a long checkout line, or perhaps with the clerk who processes our order. We can keep it simple.

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:26.899
After exchanging a few friendly words, we might pull out a contact card and simply say,

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:31.620
this is a website I thank you to enjoy. It has interesting articles in more than the

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:37.620
thousand languages. Or, after a few appropriate comments, you might offer a tract.

00:05:38.579 --> 00:05:42.500
If time permits, and the person is receptive, we can say more.

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:48.180
The same principle can apply when we're waiting at a doctor's office and airport,

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:55.699
shopping, or on public transportation. Here's an idea. Why not have a small supply of contact

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:03.149
cards or other literature with you wherever you go? We've said that we're ready to share the good

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:11.550
news wherever we find people. But what about the people we don't find? Those who are often not at home.

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:17.629
Have you ever driven through a neighborhood on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon,

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:22.670
and noticed that there was a car in every driveway? Yet, and you called on those same homes in

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:29.149
the morning? No one was at home. I wonder how many of those people would accept a Bible study

00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:36.110
if we were able to offer one. Our love for people will move us to call when they're at home.

00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:42.350
I remember in one occasion, we were going out for supper at a nearby restaurant with another

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:50.029
couple. The brother was driving. As we passed a certain house in the neighborhood, he stopped, parked,

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:56.910
and said, excuse me, but I see a car in the driveway. We've been trying for weeks to find this

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:03.949
person at home. We won't be long, and he and his wife got out and made the call. Bravo!

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.269
Another area where diligence is needed involves following up on interest.

00:07:11.149 --> 00:07:15.550
A person doing cart work has a conversation with an interested person who requests a visit.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.189
That person lives in your territory, and you agree to make the call.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:24.269
Saturday morning, you knock on the door, and what happens?

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.709
You know the answer. The person isn't at home.

00:07:28.829 --> 00:07:35.709
Are we going to throw up our hands and say, well, I tried. Not at all. That person showed interest,

00:07:35.709 --> 00:07:39.550
and we're going to keep calling back at different times until we contact him.

00:07:41.149 --> 00:07:46.029
Although we no longer fill out a detailed field service report, we can still set personal

00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:51.949
goals for ourselves. Some worthwhile goals might be listening more carefully when the householder

00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:57.949
is speaking, or showing more personal interest. Another goal might be to cover our territory

00:07:57.949 --> 00:08:04.829
more thoroughly. Having personal goals is in line with Paul's counsel, found at Galatians

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:13.470
chapter 6 and verse 4. You can follow on screen as we read this. Paul wrote, but let each one examine

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:19.310
his own actions, and then he will have cause for rejoicing in regard to himself alone,

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:28.160
and not in comparison with the other person. Personal goals can give us the motivation we need

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:34.639
to get out and it's all important work. Let's hear how some of our brothers and sisters feel

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:38.320
about the recent adjustments, and what they're doing to expand their share.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:44.080
Thanks to these adjustments, I can now enjoy my ministry in making disciples even more,

00:08:44.879 --> 00:08:50.320
and honestly, I love it. I feel like the new adjustment to

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.159
porting hours has really helped me because I'm not so worried about starting my time and

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:58.639
ending my time. I feel like I'm in the ministry all the time. Well, the first thing is I've completely

00:08:58.639 --> 00:09:04.240
changed my schedule, so I'm going out when people are out there. Previously in the ministry,

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.960
I expected people to listen to me, but now I want to listen to them.

00:09:10.159 --> 00:09:15.279
It doesn't matter how many publications I leave with people, now I see the importance of taking

00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:23.730
every opportunity to talk to people with the goal of making disciples. Before, I was so happy when

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:29.809
I could leave something from my witnessing bag, but now I'm really happy if I leave someone a

00:09:29.809 --> 00:09:38.370
piece of my heart. It has helped me really focus on what's more important and that is making

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:45.090
disciples. I love this new approach to the ministry because I'm not memorizing a specific conversation.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:50.850
Now I can talk to them more naturally and really enjoy what we discuss about the Bible.

00:09:53.299 --> 00:10:00.820
Our activity isn't defined by what we might call quantities, but rather it's motivated by the

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:07.100
love we have for people. We've noticed that the brothers and sisters in the circuit are really

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:12.860
excited about this adjusted approach to our ministry. Before it was more structured, a topic,

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:20.990
then a scripture, now it's a conversation. I used to be worried about what I would say and how I

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:27.629
would bring the conversation to the Bible, but now I realize that what matters more than what I say

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:32.029
is that the person feels that I genuinely care about them.

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:38.110
So just like Jesus approached the woman at the well, I like to approach people about their

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:43.230
dogs and I like to talk to them and ask if I could pet the dog, it starts a nice relaxed conversation

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:48.509
and that can lead into like giving them a card or talking about the truth a bit and oftentimes when

00:10:48.509 --> 00:10:52.909
I leave I will look back and they'll be scanning the card with their phone and they'll be looking

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:59.710
at the website already. I've noticed that now in the congregation we've become more observant

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.710
and then we can use those observations in our conversations.

00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:14.399
Quiet and shy by nature so there's this new method that says don't talk too much and when I heard

00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:19.519
that I was like yes, there's something that I can do really well and I just love it. I feel

00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:26.000
much more relaxed because now our goal is to start conversations so I focus on preparing ideas

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:32.159
based on the needs of the people in the territory. I feel very excited by the adjustment

00:11:32.159 --> 00:11:37.440
and the preaching work because it's encouraging us to engage in different forms of the ministry

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:42.720
such as informal and while these don't come naturally to me, I feel we're supported by Jehovah

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:47.360
in its organisation to try these different avenues and to really pursue my goal of big liponering.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:54.720
Well it's definitely made us want to extend our ministry so much more to say that we can grow out

00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:02.850
and help people to get to know Jehovah. I see many in the congregation who find great joy in

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:11.809
pioneering. I wanted to feel the same so I am very happy to be a regular pioneer starting this

00:12:11.809 --> 00:12:18.769
month. As a couple we want to attend the School for Kingdom Evangelisers because we want to

00:12:18.769 --> 00:12:24.610
improve and learning new ways of showing our love for people. I can't wait to pioneer. I want

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:29.250
to pioneer and then I'm going to go to SKE and then I want to go wherever SKE sends me because

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:34.690
it sounds like a fun adventure. It's a faint chest stick. All I have to do now is focus on people

00:12:34.690 --> 00:13:06.100
and that's great. That's what it's all about. Brothers and sisters, we love you for doing all you

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:14.419
can according to your circumstances. Jesus said has found a John 14, 15, if you love me you will

00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:21.860
observe my commandments. We love our Master and we love people. So we gladly obey Jesus

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:29.860
command to His disciples as you go preach. From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:39.860
this is JW Broadcasting.
