WEBVTT

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:07.459
Hello, everyone. We're so happy to have you with us for this month's broadcast.

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:12.460
As you can see, I have a friend with me as co-host. We are friends, aren't we?

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.460
Yes, we are, David.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.460
Oh, that's so good to hear.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.460
Now, this is Herman van Selm. He's a helper to the writing committee.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.460
And we work together every day in the writing department.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.460
Herman has quite a background.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.460
He was born in the Netherlands and spent a number of years as a missionary in South America.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.460
What was that like, Herman?

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.460
Thank you, David, for asking.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.460
My wife, K and I, served in three different lands.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.460
Now, to sum up that part of our life, three words come to mind.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.460
Challenging, amazing, rewarding.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.460
In one challenging assignment, we lived in a remote area in the rainforest where there were no other witnesses.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.460
We wondered, will we be able to find people who want to serve Jehovah?

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.460
Where do we start?

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.460
We got on our bikes and visited all villagers.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.459
In time, we conducted about 25 Bible studies.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:05.459
Wow.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:10.459
Now, despite fierce opposition from neighbors, the Bible students made amazing progress.

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:15.459
For example, one woman with her children worked hard to build this beautiful hut

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:21.459
and brought the two tears when she told us, this hut we made for our meetings.

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:23.459
It is for Jehovah.

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:24.459
Amazing.

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:31.459
One day, a group of courageous Bible students showed us the letters they had written to resign as members from their church.

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:38.459
Now, that week, the church, pastor in that tiny village, received a lot of mail.

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:40.459
I guess mail he didn't want to receive.

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:42.459
It was no fan mail.

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:50.459
It was such a rewarding experience for Kay and me to see close up how Jehovah made that little group grow into a congregation.

00:01:50.459 --> 00:02:00.459
In fact, it strengthened the faith of all of us wherever we may live to see how Jehovah cares for people who are often viewed as insignificant by the world.

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:03.459
But who are precious in God's eyes.

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:04.459
Great pictures.

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:05.459
I love it.

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:09.460
Now, what can the friends look forward to this month?

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:16.460
Well, David, this month, we'll meet Andrei Nismatchni, a retired professional soccer player,

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.460
whose story may help us to analyze our own priorities in life.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.460
Later, we'll see how Thomas learns to balance his secular work with his spiritual needs.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:36.460
And we'll enjoy an upbeat music video that reminds us all of the wonderful family we enjoy in Jehovah's organization.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.460
Sounds exciting.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.460
Let's get started.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:45.460
This is the September 2019 program of JW Broadcasting.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:03:09.180
This month, I'm going to talk about two different subjects.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.180
First, I'd like to talk about the translation of our publications.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.180
And there's a particular aspect of translation I'd like to comment on.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.180
Now, I know that quite a number of you have moved to a country where your mother tongue isn't spoken.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.180
Either defined work, or to serve or the need is greater.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:35.180
And others are serving right at home, but in foreign language congregations.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.180
At times, you may have compared an article in your mother tongue with the same article in your second language

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.180
and found differences in the translation.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.180
And you might wonder why that is.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:55.180
Oh, we'd never conclude that the translators had been unfaithful, or careless, or that they were running ahead of the organization.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.180
No, we trust our hardworking brothers and sisters.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.180
So we know there must be good reasons for the differences.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.180
And the purpose of this brief discussion is to suggest what some of those reasons might be.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.180
First, a word about one of the principles our translators follow.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:22.180
They're expected not only to render the thought in the English text accurately, but also to keep in mind the way people speak.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:31.180
So accuracy, clarity, and naturalness are needed while maintaining the dignity of our message.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:38.180
Now, what's involved in preparing a translation does both accurate and natural.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.180
It's not as if the translators are like the Jewish scribes who made copies of the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.180
To make sure that the copies they made were accurate in every detail.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:55.180
They would count not only every word, but also every letter they copied from the source text.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.180
Translations not like that.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.180
It's not as if there must be seven words in the target language if there are seven words in the English.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:10.180
Every word in the English may not be translated, but the complete thought of the English has to be there.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.180
English makes effective use of repetition.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.180
What do we mean by that?

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:26.180
Well, you can write one sentence in English, then repeat the same thought in slightly different words in the next sentence, and it sounds fine.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:34.180
But in some languages, to repeat a thought would be viewed as poor writing, and that wouldn't reflect well on our publications.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:45.180
So, in such cases, the translators are allowed to combine the two sentences into just one sentence as long as the thought is completely conveyed.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:52.180
Or, they might make two sentences out of one long English sentence if that's more natural in the language.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:06:05.180
So, you can't always compare the length of an English paragraph with the length of the paragraph in the target language and say, hey, this paragraph is shorter than that paragraph.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:13.180
Sometimes we hear brothers who have learned a second language say, I don't see why the translators didn't follow the English word for word.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.180
After all, you can say that in the language.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:27.180
Well, you may have the words, it may be possible to say that, but what a literal translation sounds strange to native speakers.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:38.180
No matter how well a foreigner has learned a language, native speakers who speak the language well are usually the best judges of what is natural.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.180
Modesty will help foreign speakers to recognize that.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:47.459
There's another thing that foreign speakers need to be aware of.

00:06:47.459 --> 00:06:59.459
If they're vocal in their criticism of a certain translation, how would that affect the confidence of native speakers who have to rely on the translation for their spiritual food?

00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:07.459
Of course, nobody's perfect, and as long as translation is done by imperfect people, it won't be perfect.

00:07:07.459 --> 00:07:13.459
But rest assured that our translators take their work very seriously.

00:07:13.459 --> 00:07:18.459
The subject of translation is complex, and I'm sure no expert.

00:07:18.459 --> 00:07:24.459
Let's hear from some brothers who have worked in the field for many years and see what we can learn.

00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:31.459
Meet Nick Aladis, Nick XRKs and Saki Moray.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:43.120
As we have just heard, the goal of translators is to convey ideas accurately, naturally, and clearly.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.120
This isn't an easy thing to do.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.120
Let's discuss a few of the challenges of translation.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:57.120
We will focus on three areas and see why translators make the choices they do.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:03.120
Bible expressions, illustrations, and vocabulary.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.120
So our first point is Bible expressions.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:16.120
Nick, would you please tell us why translating some expressions in the Bible can be very challenging?

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:25.120
Well, before our brothers and sisters receive the new world translation in their language, they have to use Bibles produced by Christendom.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:32.120
Often these Bibles contain false religious ideas and terms that reflect those ideas.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:41.120
So when we produce the new world translation, great care has to be taken not to allow such terms to distort our translation.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:51.120
Can you give us an example of an expression that was translated the wrong way in the Bibles produced by Christendom?

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.120
Well, one example is the term holy spirit.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:08.120
In many Bibles produced by Christendom, the term gives the idea of a spirit creature in heaven, even a holy ghost, sometimes even a holy demon.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.120
That must be very confusing to the readers.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.120
But what can the translators do about that?

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:23.120
In many languages, our translators have found that the closest way to translate holy spirit is to say holy power or holy force.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:28.120
This may sound very different, but it conveys the same idea.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:39.120
And even the English New World Translation describes the term holy spirit as God's active force, at Genesis 1-2, while other English translations say God's Holy Spirit.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:47.120
So now the brothers can use an expression that is understood by the field and the audience.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.120
But it must be a wonderful thing to have the new world translation.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.120
Yes, it's a wonderful thing.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.120
But still, the brothers have to get used to the new terms.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:05.120
Remember that they've been using the original terms in their local Bibles for years to teach people the truth.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:15.120
But as they get used to the new terminology and their personal study at meetings and in the ministry, they begin to see the benefits of the new terms.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.120
And afterward they really embrace the New World Translation.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.120
Thank you.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.120
Now let us go to the second challenge, illustrations.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:29.120
Why are illustrations particularly difficult to translate?

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:33.120
An illustration that works in one culture might not work in another.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:37.120
Illustrations are only effective if the reader can relate to them.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:45.120
And that's why Jesus used illustrations based on everyday things that his audience was familiar with, such as farming, building, fishing.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:49.120
And today our publications use illustrations that people can relate to.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:55.120
I remember an article I discussed the need for us to be patient in difficult situations.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:59.120
And it used the illustration of a driver who is stuck in traffic.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:07.120
Now one translation team wrote to the translator help desk and they explained that most of the readers were not familiar with traffic jams.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:11.120
For someone who lives in a big city that sounds unbelievable, but it's true.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.120
So the team wanted to use a different illustration.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:22.120
They are familiar with the idea of people standing in long lines waiting for their maze or corn to be ground at the milling machine.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:28.120
And this illustration was approved because it would help the readers get the point they need to be patient.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:34.120
Now these are completely different illustrations, but the point or the message is the same.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.120
For example, then about being patient.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:46.120
Now when we read in our language edition of the Watchtower or other publication, a different illustration than the one we read in English,

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:53.120
we can be confident that the translators received approval to make this adjustment so that the right messages convey.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.120
Well that was very helpful. Thank you.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:00.120
Now let us go to our third challenge that of vocabulary.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:04.120
That is the words that are used in a language.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:13.120
Now we might assume that for every important word in our language that they will be an exact equivalent in another language.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:17.120
Well translation is much more complicated than that.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.120
Take for example the word piece.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:29.120
Some years back we had a convention about godly peace and one might think well that's an easy word to translate.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:34.120
But that word was used about 350 times in talks on the convention.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:38.120
Sometimes referring to peace between God and man.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:42.120
Sometimes referring to peace in family or with our neighbors.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.120
And other times referring to peace of mind.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:52.120
Now in some language there's simply no way to use one word to convey all those aspects of peace.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:56.120
Because they have one word for the kind of peace that God gives.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:01.120
A different word when there's no war in a country, that kind of peace.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.120
And a different word to indicate that people are getting along with one another.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:14.120
So those translators need to understand the point of each usage in the context and then convey the right translation accordingly.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:24.120
Now it opens our mind to how wonderfully Jehovah made us with the capacity to think and feel and have many concepts and ideas.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:32.120
And to have the ability to express it in our language, in other words use words for that.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.120
But we express them in so many different ways.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:40.120
Yes this is so true. Every language has its own vocabulary and way of expressing things.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:46.120
What I find very interesting is how other languages render standard expressions that we use as Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:52.120
For example, field service, circuit overseer, kingdom hold, special pioneer.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:59.120
Those expressions were first used in English and then translators had to come up with equivalents in their languages so that it would make sense.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:06.120
But that wouldn't be difficult would it be because for the word kingdom surely we have another word and another language.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:14.120
And for the word hall we have an equivalent word and all you have to do is put the two words together to translate kingdom all.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:20.120
They may have the words but a literal translation of kingdom hold could mean something totally different.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:31.120
Now some countries still have a king. In those places this kingdom hold could mean government office or it could mean hall belonging to the kingdom of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.120
So that would be totally misleading.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:43.120
And that's why the governing body has given approval to say the meeting place of Jehovah's Witnesses or the hall of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:51.120
Even though the expressions sound a little bit different the basic intent is the same and people get the right idea.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:56.120
So it is obvious that the challenges of translation are huge.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:04.120
But now the question how can a newly formed translation team or one in a very remote location.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:19.120
Have the confidence and have the assurance that they produce the highest standard possible well all translation teams regardless of size or location benefit from regular communication with the writing committee of the governing body.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:24.120
Well we understand that the governing body directs matters from headquarters.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:28.120
But do they really know what the translators are doing?

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:35.120
Well the writing committee trust the translators but at the same time they don't try to micromanage their work.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:48.120
What they have done is set in place training programs to teach translators basic translation principles to help them to understand how to apply those principles when translating the publications.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:55.120
And this ensures that the same message is being conveyed regardless of language.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:16:02.120
And they when they're not sure that their solution is exactly right on target.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:11.120
They can write to the writing committee and ask for direction to inquire whether this solution conveys the right idea in the context.

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:18.120
Also the writing committee answers hundreds of translation questions every week as part of the ongoing training of the teams.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:26.120
All of the translators have access to these answers so that they can learn from one another on how to solve problems which are delicate and difficult.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:39.120
And this effective communication system really helps to unify the thinking of all the translators and make sure that they all produce the same message and that unifies the thinking of the worldwide field.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:45.120
Well thank you very much for explaining those factors affecting translation.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:54.120
And it is impressive that Jehovah has an arrangement in place that reverses the effect of Bable.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:17:07.119
And it is also so wonderful that by means of his Holy Spirit, Jehovah unifies his people around the earth regardless of what language they use.

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:16.119
Thanks brothers, you've given us an even deeper appreciation for all the work involved in making a quality translation.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:20.940
I learned a lot and I'm sure our audience did too.

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:26.940
Now the following video relates an experience that is very dear to my heart.

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:33.940
You see in the 1970s my wife and I were in the circuit work in Montreal, Canada.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:38.940
The one Tuesday evening after the meeting I was approached by a ministerial servant.

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.940
He was very excited.

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:47.940
He said, David, I work for the man who is the head of a small church, he's invited me to his home.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.940
That's nice, I said.

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.940
He said, no, no, no, you don't understand.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.940
They never invite anyone to their home unless they're members of the church.

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.940
I think this is going to be big.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:05.940
Well, I said, if he's interested, invite him to come to the meeting this weekend.

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:07.940
I'd love to meet him.

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:12.940
Well at weekend, I was on the lookout for the man, but he didn't show up.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:15.940
But neither did the ministerial servant.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:24.940
Soon after, on a Monday morning, fairly early, I received a phone call from brother L'Oriée Sommur,

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:28.940
who was well known in Montreal and was a special pioneer at the time.

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.940
L'Oriée said, we have a problem.

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:39.940
A thousand people want Bible studies, and many of them are going to be attending our meetings this week.

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:42.940
They were the members of that church.

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:46.940
I asked brother Sommur to take the lead in organizing the studies.

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:48.940
Now here's what happened.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:53.940
The ministerial servant had been to the man's home and he'd given a good witness.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:57.940
Then, the brother met with the other responsible men of the church.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:04.940
They were interested in what the Bible says, and they wanted other members of the church to learn about the Bible too.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:14.940
So, about half the members of the church, around 1,000 people, accepted the invitation to have a Bible study.

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:20.940
But what moved the leader of the church to invite the brother to his home in the first place?

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:33.630
Watch the following video, and I'll answer that question at the end.

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:41.630
In the mid-1970s, several brothers from the Montreal area were approached to help with a unique situation that was unfolding.

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:51.630
A special pioneer, who was taking the lead at the time, said that about 1,000 people, all from the same church, wanted to study the Bible with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:54.630
And it was all because of an informal witness.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:59.490
The story began this way.

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:06.490
A brother in the local congregation approached me one day to tell me about an experience he had with one of his workmates.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:13.490
This man was responsible for a small local church, and the brother had been able to give him an informal witness.

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:23.490
The man indicated that he would like a Bible study, and he wanted to convince the other members of his church to also study the Bible with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:29.490
The fact was, this person had a certain influence in the church.

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:34.490
So he talked to the church members about the message he had heard from the brother.

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:40.490
And he convinced them that what they were missing was a better understanding of the Bible.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:44.490
Many people heard about it because it was an exceptional event.

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:50.490
From what I heard, there was around 1,000 people who wanted to study the Bible at that time.

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:56.490
We didn't have the brothers and sisters that were needed to conduct all these Bible studies.

00:20:56.490 --> 00:21:00.490
So they formed groups of 10, 12, 15 people.

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:05.490
And once or twice a week in King of Halls, they conducted Bible studies.

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:10.490
It was questions, questions. Everyone was asking questions.

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:18.500
But the Bible could always answer all these questions in a logical way.

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:25.500
One verse would explain another, and we came to see that the Bible in its entirety could explain every subject.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:32.769
At the beginning, groups of two or three family studied together.

00:21:32.769 --> 00:21:35.769
And yeah, they answered with the Bible.

00:21:35.769 --> 00:21:38.769
That amazed me because I didn't know the Bible at all.

00:21:38.769 --> 00:21:45.769
But I thought the Bible talks about this, the Bible talks about that. It was like a discovery for me.

00:21:45.769 --> 00:21:52.769
That was the parents. The children weren't there, so when we accepted it, then we teach it to our children.

00:21:52.769 --> 00:21:58.240
Everyone was disciplined, sitting at the table.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:03.240
The children were very quiet with their truth book in front of them and their Bible.

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:11.240
When these families came to the Kingdom Hall, the children were sitting beside their parents, not moving, paying attention to what was being said.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:16.240
I was young when they started coming. I remember it very well. A lot of them were my age.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:23.240
I saw them like future potential friends. It was really touching.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:33.490
The first meeting I attended was here in Laval. It really contributed to me one day taking a stand.

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:40.490
And Jehovah becoming my God and the truth becoming my way of life.

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:48.750
When I was young, I was very afraid of death.

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:56.750
It was such a relief to learn that we don't suffer when we die. It's like a sleep.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:02.750
The ambitions I had before that may have been attainable became second place.

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:10.750
Now it was to have a simple life, to walk with the organization and to raise my children in the truth.

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:18.750
Today these brothers are really doing a lot in the organization, helping in different areas, shoulders and great responsibilities.

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:24.750
My father always strived to set the example for all his children. And it made an impression on me.

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:28.750
Now my wife and I have the privilege of serving here at the Canada branch.

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:32.750
I was eight years old when my family started attending meetings.

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:39.750
I have really good memories of how the local congregation at the time took care of us and looked after us.

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:44.750
At the age of 15, I started reading my Bible every day and studying it too.

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:48.750
From that point on, I knew what I wanted to do with my life.

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:51.750
Serve Jehovah full time.

00:23:51.750 --> 00:24:05.700
I really think Jehovah could see us on the inside. Jehovah helped us a lot.

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:12.900
You can't have anything better than that.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:16.900
On our own, we never would have got out of that situation.

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:22.750
But Jehovah found a way to find rightly disposed ones.

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:35.019
A simple informal witness led to Bible studies that touched so many.

00:24:35.019 --> 00:24:42.019
The brother was able to give a good witness, but what motivated the church leader to listen to him in the first place?

00:24:42.019 --> 00:24:51.019
It was the brother's conduct. He was a very loving brother, and the way he dealt with others in the workplace really impressed the man.

00:24:52.019 --> 00:24:57.019
The poet said, I'd rather see a sermon than here one any day.

00:24:57.019 --> 00:25:02.019
Those words certainly proved true in this exciting experience.

00:25:02.019 --> 00:25:07.019
That's an excellent transition into the next part of our program.

00:25:07.019 --> 00:25:19.680
In this dramatization, we'll see for ourselves how a Christian's conduct, even at work, can have a powerful effect on those around him.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:24.680
Sometimes, I really hate my job.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:43.910
I don't know how Jason stays so positive.

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:48.910
I asked Jason why he refused the money, and I found out he's one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:56.910
My wife is true, so I know a lot about them. But what Jason did really surprised me.

00:25:56.910 --> 00:26:04.220
I wondered why he didn't feel like he was entitled to the extra money.

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:10.220
He's such a hard worker, and most of our supervisors accept bribes.

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:19.220
Jason showed me a Bible verse, whatever you are doing, work at a whole soul as for Jehovah and not for men.

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:25.220
Jason's relationship with God influences every aspect of his life.

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:33.220
Even his attitude toward work, he couldn't participate in something dishonest, even if others do.

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:39.660
I could see that Jason really lived by his beliefs.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:27:05.180
Jason invited me to see the construction project he's been volunteering at.

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:14.180
I felt like I had entered another world. People of different races worked alongside each other without prejudice.

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:17.180
And they were all volunteers.

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:23.059
Jason offered to study the Bible with me.

00:27:24.059 --> 00:27:29.059
Emma has asked me to study in the past, and I've always refused.

00:27:29.059 --> 00:27:42.329
But this time, I accepted.

00:27:42.329 --> 00:27:59.690
I liked my study and even enjoyed going to the Kingdom Hall occasionally.

00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:04.690
But I have to work overtime to support my family.

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:07.690
I can't go to meetings every week.

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:21.380
Hey Jason, how do you do it all?

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:27.380
Work, family, medias, even volunteer work.

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:32.380
I tried to keep in mind Jesus' words in Matthew 6 verse 22.

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:38.930
Jesus compared our eyes to a lamp.

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:43.930
He said if our eye is focused, our whole body will be bright.

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:49.819
It's impossible to focus on more than one thing at a time.

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:59.630
Jesus wanted his followers to focus on a single purpose, that of doing God's will.

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:04.630
Rather than being distracted by material things, my wife and I lead a simple life,

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:11.630
avoiding unnecessary debt or acquiring possessions that consume a lot of time and attention.

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:15.630
This way of life allows us to have time for what's truly important.

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:19.630
If you asked Emma, which do you think she would prefer?

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:27.500
She made more money or spent more time with her at the Kingdom Hall.

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:30.500
Jason's example really impressed me.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:34.500
He was an honest and diligent worker.

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:38.500
But he also kept secular work in its proper place.

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:44.500
It made me think about the choices I make and I decided that I too

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:48.500
want to work whole soul for Jehovah.

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:52.500
James chapter 2 verse 17 and 18 in part states,

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:57.500
faith by itself without works is dead.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:04.500
Show me your faith without the works and I will show you my faith by my works.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:10.500
Now the faith that Jason displayed by works at his secular job motivated Thomas

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:16.500
to accept the Bible study and continue to make spiritual progress despite setbacks.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:22.500
Seeing this and hearing of real life examples such as in our previous video are

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:28.500
excellent reminders of what a powerful witness our actions can be.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:35.500
But what if you're in a situation where displaying faith calls for us to give up

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:39.500
something we previously loved or enjoyed?

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:51.019
The story of soccer player Andrei Nesmaczni may help us to see what action to take.

00:30:51.019 --> 00:30:54.019
Soccer was my reason for living.

00:30:54.019 --> 00:30:58.019
I was dreamed of becoming a professional soccer player.

00:30:58.019 --> 00:31:04.349
I thought that happiness comes from vain.

00:31:04.349 --> 00:31:10.869
A good career.

00:31:10.869 --> 00:31:14.660
Money.

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:20.779
When I was six my parents signed me up for soccer.

00:31:20.779 --> 00:31:22.779
I really love playing soccer.

00:31:22.779 --> 00:31:26.779
It's been all my time at the stadium even laid into the night.

00:31:26.779 --> 00:31:29.779
When I was 12 I learned about Jehovah from my mom.

00:31:29.779 --> 00:31:32.779
At that time she started studying the Bible.

00:31:32.779 --> 00:31:36.779
And after about a year I began to preach from door to door.

00:31:36.779 --> 00:31:41.779
When I was 17 years old I finished school and I received an invitation from the

00:31:41.779 --> 00:31:45.059
Dynamo Soccer Club in Kiev.

00:31:45.059 --> 00:31:48.059
Oh that was unforgettable.

00:31:48.059 --> 00:31:53.059
Yes my emotions were running high because since childhood I always dreamed of playing for Dynamo.

00:31:53.059 --> 00:32:05.009
From that moment on all my energy and all my time were devoted to my career.

00:32:05.009 --> 00:32:14.019
Every day we either trained or there was a game.

00:32:14.019 --> 00:32:27.210
There was no time left for spiritual things.

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:31.210
Of course being around people like that I became just like them.

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:40.109
I led in a moral lifestyle because huge amounts of money opened up many opportunities.

00:32:43.859 --> 00:32:45.859
Going to nightclubs.

00:32:45.859 --> 00:32:47.859
The nightlife.

00:32:47.859 --> 00:32:50.859
It was so immoral.

00:32:50.859 --> 00:32:52.859
Everyone wants to be your friend.

00:32:52.859 --> 00:32:53.859
To meet you.

00:32:53.859 --> 00:32:56.859
And of course this was done thing.

00:32:56.859 --> 00:33:08.740
I also invested huge sums of money in real estate.

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:14.740
I wanted to create a foundation for the future and wealth for myself, my family and my relatives.

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:17.740
So that no one would be in need.

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:20.740
Yes I was sure that this really was happiness.

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:25.079
This continued for nine years.

00:33:25.079 --> 00:33:30.079
The turning point was a conversation with management when an issue came up.

00:33:30.079 --> 00:33:33.079
And they hurled insults at me.

00:33:33.079 --> 00:33:36.079
At that moment I felt worthless.

00:33:36.079 --> 00:33:38.079
Like a disposable cup.

00:33:38.079 --> 00:33:43.079
That you use then crush and throw away.

00:33:43.079 --> 00:33:48.079
Besides a new generation of soccer players was arriving.

00:33:48.079 --> 00:33:50.079
Many young guys.

00:33:50.079 --> 00:33:53.079
I stopped being included in the starting lineup.

00:33:53.079 --> 00:33:57.579
Also the financial crisis began.

00:33:57.579 --> 00:34:00.579
And real estate prices fell drastically.

00:34:00.579 --> 00:34:02.579
I panicked.

00:34:02.579 --> 00:34:04.579
I didn't know what to do.

00:34:04.579 --> 00:34:07.579
And I started to think about the meaning of life.

00:34:07.579 --> 00:34:09.579
What really is the meaning of life?

00:34:09.579 --> 00:34:12.579
If it's not a career, not money.

00:34:12.579 --> 00:34:14.579
And what is it?

00:34:14.579 --> 00:34:19.579
And then I remembered everything that I learned about Jehovah when I was a teenager.

00:34:19.579 --> 00:34:23.579
I began to study the Bible again, along with my wife.

00:34:23.579 --> 00:34:26.579
After a year I started preaching again.

00:34:26.579 --> 00:34:31.579
And in 2009 I was baptized as one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:34:31.579 --> 00:34:36.579
And this brought me so much joy and satisfaction.

00:34:36.579 --> 00:34:41.579
These feelings can't be compared to winning any medal or cup.

00:34:44.409 --> 00:34:48.409
I realized that I couldn't slave for two masters.

00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:53.690
But I still had to play two more years for dynamo Kiev.

00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:58.690
Although it was a difficult time, I took advantage of this opportunity.

00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:03.690
And I'm thankful to Jehovah that a good witness was given about his name.

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:08.690
There were some soccer players who showed interest in the truth.

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:15.690
In 2011, when my contract ended, I finished my professional career.

00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:19.690
First Timothy chapter 6 encourages us to place our hope,

00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:26.690
not on uncertain riches, but on God and to be rich and fine works.

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:29.690
People ask me, do you regret it?

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:31.690
Maybe you'd like to come back?

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:33.690
Do you miss soccer?

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:36.690
And I honestly and sincerely say no.

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:39.690
I don't miss it and I don't want to go back.

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:45.690
Because my relationship with Jehovah can't be compared to anything.

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:49.690
Everything that this world offers is all short-lived.

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:51.690
And it's only an illusion.

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:55.690
People see only one side of the picture, the fame, the money.

00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:59.690
The other side is the injures, disappointments.

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:03.690
It's very hard psychologically and emotionally.

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:06.690
You have no freedom.

00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:11.690
That's why it's better to give the very best to the one who appreciates it.

00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:17.690
What you do for Jehovah will always bring you happiness, joy and satisfaction.

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:27.070
Did you notice how Andre mentioned that he couldn't slave for two masters

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:33.070
and this led him to abandon eventually the world of professional sports?

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:41.070
Yes, often our faith moves us to leave behind careers and activities we once loved.

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:45.070
But to quote Paul's words at Philippians chapter 3 verse 8,

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:52.070
I have taken the loss of all things and I consider them as a lot of refuse.

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:58.070
Or as the footnote states, garbage, rubbish that I may gain Christ.

00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:03.070
We can have confidence that anything we throw away for the sake of our spirituality

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:10.070
has no real value when we compare it to the blessings we enjoy as Jehovah's friends.

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:12.070
Back to you, David.

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:14.070
Thanks, Herman. That was great.

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:18.860
For my second discussion on this broadcast,

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:22.860
I'd like to talk to you on the theme, Do the Math.

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:27.860
Yes, you heard right. Do the Math.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:31.860
Now, Math may not be your favorite subject.

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:34.860
But as we're going to see, someone has to do it.

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:38.860
Sometimes, doing the Math is the only way we can make a timeline

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:43.860
or get interesting background information that makes our Bible reading more enjoyable.

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:47.860
And you do want to make your Bible reading more enjoyable, don't you?

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:49.860
Of course you do.

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:51.860
Well, let's start with a number.

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:54.860
We might quickly skip over in our Bible reading.

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:58.860
Let's turn to Matthew chapter 19 and verse 28.

00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:05.860
And let's see how a number can sometimes tell us more than what's written on the page.

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:09.860
Matthew 19 and verse 28.

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:11.860
Jesus said to them,

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:13.860
truly I say to you,

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:18.860
in the recreation when the son of man sits down on his glorious throne,

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:23.860
you who have followed me will sit on twelve thrones.

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:27.860
Judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:30.860
Did you see anything interesting there?

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:34.530
I'll give you a hint.

00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:40.530
These words respoke near the end of Jesus' earthly ministry.

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:42.530
Does that give you a hint?

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:44.530
I'll give you another hint.

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:47.530
The number twelve.

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:54.530
At this point, Jesus knew that only eleven of His apostles were going to be faithful.

00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:59.530
Yet, He said there would be twelve thrones in the kingdom, not eleven.

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:00.530
What did it mean?

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:05.530
It meant that Judas would have to be replaced as an apostle.

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:08.530
And sure enough, He was.

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:10.530
Well, that was easy, wasn't it?

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:13.530
There was no math involved. It was just a number.

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:19.530
But let's see how doing the math can help us to answer a few questions.

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:21.530
During family worship,

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:27.530
one of the kids asked whether Noah and Abraham knew each other.

00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:31.530
How are you going to handle that? Do you know?

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:35.530
You might just say the Bible doesn't say and leave it at that.

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:39.530
But you could figure it out if you did the math.

00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:42.530
Now, here's what we know.

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:47.530
The flood occurred in 2370 BCE.

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:50.530
Now, that date is absolutely solid.

00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:52.530
And if you'd like to figure it out for yourself,

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:57.530
you can look it up under chronology in the Insight book.

00:39:57.530 --> 00:40:00.530
2370 BCE, that's the flood.

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:05.530
And Noah lived for 350 years after the flood.

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:10.530
So, by subtracting 350 from 2370,

00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:15.530
we learned that Noah died in 2020 BCE.

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:18.530
But remember the question. The question is,

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:21.530
did Noah and Abraham know each other?

00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:29.780
Abraham answered the land of Canaan in 1943 BCE.

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:31.780
Now, once again, if you want to prove that to yourself,

00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:33.780
look it in sight under chronology.

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:37.780
You'll find everything you need to prove it to yourself.

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:41.780
So, 1943 Abraham, Abraham, in that case,

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:44.780
he enters the land of Canaan.

00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:48.780
And he's 75 years old at the time.

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:54.780
So, Abraham must have been born 75 years before 1943.

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:57.780
Add 75 to 1943,

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:02.780
and you'll find that Abraham was born in 2018 BCE.

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:05.780
So, Noah died in 2020,

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:10.780
and Abraham was born two years later in 2018.

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:12.780
They never knew each other.

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:14.780
But it was close.

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:23.659
Our publications have often said that Jonathan was at least 30 years older than David.

00:41:23.659 --> 00:41:25.659
But the Bible doesn't say that.

00:41:25.659 --> 00:41:27.659
You're a progressive Bible student.

00:41:27.659 --> 00:41:32.659
You know, the one who makes you prove everything, he asks you about that.

00:41:32.659 --> 00:41:34.659
Can you prove it?

00:41:34.659 --> 00:41:35.659
Can you?

00:41:35.659 --> 00:41:39.659
You can, if you do the math.

00:41:39.659 --> 00:41:42.659
King Saul ruled Israel for 40 years.

00:41:43.659 --> 00:41:45.659
Then David became king.

00:41:45.659 --> 00:41:48.659
The how old was David when he became king?

00:41:48.659 --> 00:41:51.659
The Bible says he was 30 years old.

00:41:51.659 --> 00:41:54.659
That means that when David was born,

00:41:54.659 --> 00:41:58.659
Saul had already been ruling Israel for 10 years.

00:41:58.659 --> 00:42:01.659
But when Saul became king,

00:42:01.659 --> 00:42:03.659
Jonathan was a grown man.

00:42:03.659 --> 00:42:05.659
He was probably already in the army.

00:42:05.659 --> 00:42:08.659
You had to be at least 20 years old to be in the army.

00:42:08.659 --> 00:42:13.659
So, if Jonathan was at least 20 when Saul began to rule,

00:42:13.659 --> 00:42:17.659
and David was born 10 years after that,

00:42:17.659 --> 00:42:22.659
what difference in age would there be between Jonathan and David?

00:42:22.659 --> 00:42:25.659
About 30 years difference.

00:42:25.659 --> 00:42:28.659
20 plus 10 equals 30.

00:42:28.659 --> 00:42:33.170
Now, the next one is a bit more complicated.

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:35.170
It's the last one.

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:37.170
And we can do this.

00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:41.170
Inside on the Scriptures says that Moses and Job

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:43.170
lived at the same time.

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:46.170
But the Bible doesn't say that.

00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:48.170
How can we be so sure?

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:51.170
Once again, what do we do?

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:53.170
Do I hear it?

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:54.170
You're right.

00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:57.170
We do the math.

00:42:57.170 --> 00:43:02.170
Job's test must have occurred some time after the death of Joseph.

00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:06.170
We know that because at Job 1, Jehovah told Satan

00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:10.170
there is no one like Job on the earth.

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:11.170
No one.

00:43:11.170 --> 00:43:13.170
Now, if Joseph had still been alive,

00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:18.170
Jehovah would have said there was no one like Joseph and Job on the earth.

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:21.170
And if the test had occurred earlier,

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:25.170
Jehovah would have said there was no one like Jacob and Job,

00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:28.170
Isaac and Job, Abraham and Job.

00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:33.170
And remember, there were only two years between Noah and Abraham.

00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:40.170
So we can conclude that the test of Job occurred after the death of Joseph.

00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:43.170
When did Joseph die?

00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:45.170
The date is solid.

00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:49.170
It's 1657 BCE.

00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:51.170
How do we figure that?

00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:54.170
If you don't like math, trust me.

00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:56.170
You don't want to know.

00:43:56.170 --> 00:44:00.170
But inside, and the Bible will give you all the information you need

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:02.170
to figure it out for yourself.

00:44:02.170 --> 00:44:04.170
But let's keep it simple.

00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:08.170
Let's go with 1657 BCE.

00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:13.170
That's 144 years before Israel left Egypt

00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:18.170
under the direction of Moses in 1513 BCE.

00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:26.170
So, Job's test must have occurred some time within that 144-year period.

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:29.170
Now this is a big hint.

00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:34.170
144 years before Israel left Egypt.

00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:37.170
Are you beginning to put it together?

00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:40.170
Here is the clincher.

00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:45.170
Job lived for 140 years after he passed the test.

00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:50.170
So he was probably still alive in the land of us when Israel left Egypt.

00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:52.170
Conclusion.

00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:58.170
Job and Moses definitely lived at the same time.

00:44:58.170 --> 00:45:01.170
So what have we learned by doing the math?

00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:08.170
Superficially, we might say, well, we learned that Abraham was born two years after Noah,

00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:13.170
and we proved that Jonathan was at least 30 years older than David,

00:45:13.170 --> 00:45:17.170
and that Moses and Job definitely lived at the same time.

00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:21.170
Superficially, we got the answers to those questions, yes.

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:27.170
But the fact is, probably none of those questions ever kept you up at night.

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:29.170
There's a broader picture here.

00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:35.170
What we'd like you to take away is the fact that sometimes a number is more than just a number.

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:39.170
It can provide information that we couldn't get any other way.

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:45.170
And if we can understand that, this discussion will have been well worth having.

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:50.170
So, when you see a number in the Bible, don't run the other way.

00:45:50.170 --> 00:45:54.170
Embrace it, stop and think about it.

00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:57.170
You may be glad you did.

00:45:57.170 --> 00:46:02.170
Well, after all that math, how about a little music?

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:09.170
This month's music video will let us experience some of the joy of traveling to an international convention

00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:37.070
and meeting our spiritual family members from around the globe.

00:46:38.070 --> 00:50:13.860
That song really captures the excitement that we feel when we meet new members of our family.

00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:16.860
I certainly agree. It was great.

00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:23.860
Well, this month we saw how our actions can help motivate right-hearted ones to accept the truth.

00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:28.860
We peeked behind the scenes to learn how translation work is done.

00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:31.860
And we even did a little math.

00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:38.860
Herman, I love working with you on the Writing Department and I loved working with you on this project this month.

00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:39.860
Thank you, Daisy.

00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:43.860
Well, thank you. I really appreciate your help.

00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:49.860
Now, I've been informed that many of you will be notified of the dates for your regional convention this month.

00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:54.860
Would you like to know the theme for the 2020 Convention Program?

00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:58.860
I'll lower my voice and I'll let you in on it.

00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:02.860
The program is based on Philippians 4, verse 4.

00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:05.860
And the theme always rejoice.

00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:07.860
It's not a great theme.

00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:11.860
We're going to have a great time advertising this convention theme.

00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:14.860
Can you imagine having that on your convention badge?

00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:16.860
And people will look at that badge and they'll say,

00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:21.860
what do you have to be so happy about? And then we'll tell them.

00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:27.860
But before we end the program, let's join Herman on a short visit to the country of Botswana

00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:30.860
in the southern part of Africa.

00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:35.860
Botswana is home to many natural wonders.

00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:40.860
Among them is the Okavangu Delta, a natural haven for wildlife.

00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:45.860
This country is also the home of the highest concentration of elephants in the world.

00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:55.860
However, when it comes to people that are only about two and a half million residents spread out over this very large country.

00:51:55.860 --> 00:52:04.860
And with only 2,316 publicers, the ratio of witnesses to residents is about 1 to 1,000.

00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:14.860
So they always enjoy it when need graders offer to come and assist them as they cover hundreds of kilometers of undersigned territory

00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:22.860
on preaching trips that can last for days or even four weeks in order to reach the most remote villages.

00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:27.860
Currently, there are 45 congregations and two isolated groups.

00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:36.860
The etsa congregation located in the Okavangu Moremi area is small with only seven publicers and no elders.

00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:45.860
But the zeal of these publicers is amazing as they travel long distances, often on foot, just to attend meetings.

00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:52.860
This travel is not only difficult because of the distance, but also because wild animals roam freely in the area.

00:52:52.860 --> 00:53:00.860
Regardless of the challenges, the brothers and sisters enjoy coming together to serve Jehovah and to share in the ministry.

00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:08.860
This congregation is just one of many examples of the faithful brothers and sisters throughout Botswana

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:13.860
who are spreading the truth into even the most remote locations.

00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:18.860
And they want to share their love and greetings with all of them.

00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:25.860
We send our love to all our brothers and sisters in Botswana and all of you, wherever you might be.

00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:28.860
We love you all very much.

00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:36.860
Until next time, this is JW Broadcasting from the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses.
