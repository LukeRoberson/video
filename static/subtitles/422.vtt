00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:07.769
Have you ever asked a child where's Jehovah right away? Their finger goes up to cute

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:13.169
We appreciate that their parents have taught them some very basic things Jehovah's name as well

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:16.629
But what if we were to ask the same question of an adult?

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.070
Where's Jehovah and they put their hand up?

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.550
Not so cute

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:29.769
The question is really deeper than that the question where is Jehovah is really where is Jehovah in my life?

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.530
Where is Jehovah when I'm making decisions?

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:35.130
What is his will?

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.130
What would he like for me to do?

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.570
That's the question

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.609
Where is Jehovah in my life?

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:46.570
And that's basically what Jesus Christ was saying in the model prayer

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:52.450
There would be a priority in things that we would request of our Heavenly Father if we were to put our own

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.609
Interests first our concerns that would really be out of the priority that he outlined

00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:05.569
It's the sanctification of Jehovah's name, which is number one and then his kingdom as well as Jehovah's will

00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:12.170
When Jesus was here on earth there was no question that he put Jehovah first in his life

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:19.530
Everything he did everything he said how he treated others all revolved around Jehovah's sanctification

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:23.489
Jesus not only gave the model prayer

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.530
He lived the model prayer. He worked in perfect harmony with that prayer and

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:38.129
He instructed his followers to do the same always trying to put Jehovah as the number one thing in their life in

00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:42.209
Small decisions as well as the larger decisions

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.489
So he gave the model prayer for something for us to follow as a model as a guide not word for word

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.010
But the thoughts and the order of importance within that prayer in fact

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.650
Jesus was so concerned about sanctifying Jehovah's name that he did this on a regular basis

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:09.009
Reminding his closest associates how to pray what are the proper things to pray for?

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:18.770
The footnote under Matthew 6 9 is interesting be sanctified it defines it as be held sacred be treated as holy

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.849
And that really helps us to understand what sanctification means

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:31.849
But our study Bible really helps us as as his point is put out in a comment it says this in the study Bible

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:38.889
This is a petition that all creation including both humans and angels hold God's name holy

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:47.050
The petition also includes the thought that God take action to sanctify himself by clearing his name of the reproach

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:53.530
That has been heaped on it ever since the rebellion of the first human pair in the Garden of Eden

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:56.449
Yes towards the end of Jesus

00:02:56.449 --> 00:03:02.569
Ministry he could confidently and humbly approach Jehovah and say in John 1726

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:08.289
I have made your name known to them and I will make it known to them

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:15.889
Those are the words that we want to say as well as we follow Jesus our model and

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.969
And there's no question again that Jesus put Jehovah first

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:24.650
He was a priority the sanctification of his name was number one

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:30.569
To sanctify God's name for you and for me is more than just words

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:39.009
It's more than what we say in our prayer. It's what we do what we put into action and we need to ask ourselves on a daily basis

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.449
Where is Jehovah in my life when I'm making decisions?

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:48.969
How I treat others and how I serve Jehovah

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:57.210
Yes, Jehovah must be very happy when he looks down at all those who are tied into this program to see how they you

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.250
Are putting Jehovah first you are simplifying your lives

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:07.490
You're sanctifying his name by your work assignments in the congregation in your actions and your thoughts

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:12.689
And many of us have been serving Jehovah for many years many decades

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.129
But we must continue to ask where is Jehovah in my life by making wise decisions

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.250
Even if we have many years of faithful service

00:04:22.649 --> 00:04:29.009
The problem with Jehovah's people in the past his named people Israel was that they were supposed to be holy

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:32.410
They were supposed to be sanctified set apart to do his will

00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:40.449
But many times they did their own will notice what the prophet Jeremiah had to say on this subject at Jeremiah chapter 2

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:47.930
Verses 5 and 6 and notice the question that is posed by Jeremiah to those people

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:57.449
Jeremiah 2 5 says this is what Jehovah says what fault did your forefathers find in me so that they strayed so far from me

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:02.290
And they walked after worthless idols and became worthless themselves

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.089
This is the point they did not ask where is Jehovah

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:15.610
Simple question, but profound and notice verse 8 even the priests who were supposed to be holy leading the people

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:23.290
They did not ask where is Jehovah those handling the law did not know me the shepherds rebelled against me

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:29.490
The prophets prophesied by bail and they followed those who could bring no benefit

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:36.370
Jehovah was not part of their lives. They were doing their own will not Jehovah's

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.730
Now it's one thing to follow Jehovah's direction to do his will when things are going well

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.050
When things are going as we have

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.769
anticipated, but what about when difficulties come upon us trial some situations

00:05:50.329 --> 00:05:52.329
Then here comes the test

00:05:52.329 --> 00:05:57.050
Now many of God's servants throughout the centuries have proved their integrity their faithfulness

00:05:57.329 --> 00:05:59.970
Despite whatever has been thrown against them

00:06:00.329 --> 00:06:07.050
Can you think of a Bible character that had so much against him so much trial so much

00:06:07.769 --> 00:06:11.529
depressing situations and he was yet very faithful

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:14.329
Are you thinking about Job

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:20.850
There's one of the characters that we refer to many many times now Job was a faithful man

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.529
We know the end of the story, but throughout his or deals

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:32.730
He really was tested and he lost focus. He became short-sighted. He became self-absorbed in a way

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:37.089
He replaced all the windows in his home with mirrors

00:06:37.769 --> 00:06:41.250
So all he could see is himself all he could see is his own problems

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:50.569
So Jehovah used the young man a lie who to remind Job that he needed to look at things from a different perspective notice Job 35

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.970
Job 35

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:55.970
and verse 9

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:07.410
The lie who said people cry out when under great oppression they cry for relief from the domination of the powerful

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.209
But no one says where is God my grand maker?

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:19.490
So he was trying to really remind him of the big picture things from looking at things from Jehovah's standpoint

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:28.170
And he helped Job remove those mirrors so he could look out his windows see Jehovah see the big picture see his smallness

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:33.970
In comparison to Jehovah's largeness in fact if you go to Job 42

00:07:34.769 --> 00:07:41.810
Notice there his response as he was readjusted and humbly listen to these reminders Job 42 verse 3

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:45.970
He said I spoke but without understanding verse 5

00:07:46.329 --> 00:07:51.290
My ears have heard about you, but now I do see you with my eyes

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:56.689
And that is why I take back what I said and I repent in dust and ashes

00:07:57.689 --> 00:08:04.930
Job's experience is something that we may have experienced some kind of trial some kind of discouraging experience

00:08:05.569 --> 00:08:09.889
There's a very close friend of mine that came into Bethel around the same time as myself

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.050
We got married around the same time

00:08:12.689 --> 00:08:16.889
Unfortunately, he lost his wife in death a few years ago

00:08:18.129 --> 00:08:22.649
Now that very month what did he do? Did he get depressed? Did he quit?

00:08:23.129 --> 00:08:29.970
He auxiliary pioneered and when I spoke to him and asked him how could you have such a focus such a determination?

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:36.690
He said well, I looked at it this way Paul said that we are a theatrical spectacle before men and angels

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.690
I view myself as

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:43.570
This is my Job moment. So here I am. I'm thrust on to this stage

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.570
Up in that balcony is Jehovah Jesus

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:52.610
The resurrected anointed ones the angels they're looking down at me and there before me

00:08:52.649 --> 00:08:58.529
In the audience is the world and my brothers and my sisters and down in that orchestra pit

00:08:58.809 --> 00:09:04.610
Satan the devil and the demons here. I am lights are on all everyone's looking at me

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:11.730
What am I going to do? Will I run? Will I hide or is this my Job moment? Is this where I prove my integrity?

00:09:12.169 --> 00:09:15.409
He did and he continues to do so today

00:09:15.929 --> 00:09:20.730
But what about us when we're going through discouraging circumstances?

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:29.690
Our Job moment. Do we ask where is Jehovah? Are we proving by our integrity by what we're doing promoting Kingdom interest?

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:32.490
St. Define Jehovah as the number one thing in our life?

00:09:33.529 --> 00:09:41.730
Are we doing that daily? We need to ask ourselves that on a daily basis even when we're giving talks when we're dealing with

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:47.289
Brothers and sisters at work or in a congregation we need to ask where is Jehovah?

00:09:48.009 --> 00:09:54.009
And that will really change our treatment of others how we view them and how we view ourselves

00:09:54.529 --> 00:10:02.610
So Jesus reminders really help us to appreciate that there's a priority in what we pray for and how we carry out those prayers

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:11.529
Always putting Jehovah as the number one thing in our life knowing that all of our other requests our personal requests will be heard by Jehovah and

00:10:11.809 --> 00:10:13.809
Will be answered by him
