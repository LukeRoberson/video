WEBVTT

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:05.960
For a few moments, I would like to speak to you on the theme,

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.960
we continually remember your endurance.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.759
What is endurance?

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.559
The original language word in the Greek scriptures

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:20.960
has the sense of standing one's ground

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.760
and persevering, remaining steadfast under trial.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.960
But it means even more than just toughing it out

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.960
under a difficult circumstance.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.960
The Christian who endures has genuine hope.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.960
He or she is convinced that as 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and verse 17 puts it,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.960
the tribulation is momentary and light

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.960
compared with the reward which is everlasting.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.960
To illustrate the importance of endurance,

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.960
you see before me a number of suitcases.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.959
Some are small, some are large.

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:10.959
What we don't know is how heavy each one is.

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:13.959
That depends on what's inside.

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:18.959
Some large suitcases can be surprisingly light.

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:24.959
Some smaller ones could be surprisingly heavy.

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:29.959
In a sense, this illustrates what confronts each one of us

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:35.959
when we dedicate our life to Jehovah and start out on the race for life.

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:40.959
At first, we may not know what loads will have to carry.

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:45.959
We may worry about what might seem to be big tests

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:50.959
only to find that they're not as overwhelming as we feared they would be.

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:55.959
On the other hand, some loads that we thought would be light,

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:58.959
perhaps getting along with one another in love,

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:03.959
might be heavier to carry than we anticipated.

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:07.959
Then there are unexpected tests of our faith,

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:12.960
tests that could involve health problems, financial anxieties,

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.960
family issues, and personal disappointments.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.960
All such situations call for endurance.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.960
The governing body wants you dear brothers and sisters to know

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.960
that we love you for your steadfast endurance.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.960
Our feelings are well summarized by Paul's words

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.960
at 1 Thessalonians 1 verses 2 and 3.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.960
There he wrote to the faithful Christians,

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.960
we always thank God.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.960
When we mention all of you in our prayers,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.960
for we continually remember your faithful work,

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.960
your loving labor, and your endurance,

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.960
because of your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.960
in the presence of our God and Father.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.960
How beautifully these words convey our feelings about you.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.960
We are greatly encouraged and strengthened by your faithfulness,

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.960
your integrity, and your endurance.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.960
No matter what type of hardship you are facing,

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.960
two things are certain.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.960
Jehovah knows how heavy your load is,

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.960
and he can give you the strength to carry it.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.960
Think about that first statement.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.960
Jehovah knows how heavy your load is.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.960
How do we know that?

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.960
Open your Bible to Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 10.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.960
Here, the Apostle Paul, himself,

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.960
a wonderful example of endurance,

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.960
tells us what makes our steadfast endurance worthwhile.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.960
Hebrews chapter 6 verse 10 says,

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.960
For God is not unrighteous,

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.960
so as to forget your work,

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.959
and the love you showed for his name

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.959
by ministering and continuing to minister to the holy ones.

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:28.959
Imagine, Jehovah would consider it unrighteous

00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:31.959
to take your endurance for granted.

00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:36.959
In fact, Jehovah does more than acknowledge your work.

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:40.959
He also helps you to carry your load.

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:43.959
How do we know that?

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:49.959
Open your Bible to Philippians chapter 4 verses 12 and 13.

00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:55.810
And notice here what the Apostle Paul,

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.810
this model of endurance, tells us.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.810
Now, just before we read it,

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:07.810
perhaps we may think of Paul as being a newcomer to the Christian faith,

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.810
and compared to many others, he was.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.810
But by the time he wrote to the Philippians in 60 or 61 CE,

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.810
Paul had encountered many obstacles.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.810
He had many heavy loads to carry.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.810
Paul mentions a few of them in these verses.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.810
But then, in the second half of verse 12,

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.810
notice what Paul writes in everything.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.810
And in all circumstances,

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.810
I have learned the secret of both how to be full

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.810
and how to hunger,

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.810
both how to have an abundance and how to do without.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.810
Now, notice what he says in verse 13.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.810
For all things, I have the strength

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.810
through the one who gives me power.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.810
What does this mean for us?

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.810
That whatever load we have to carry as a Christian,

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.810
we are not doing it with our own power.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.810
Jehovah will help us carry it.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.810
He will give us the needed strength.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:25.810
Paul knew that because he had experienced this

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.810
from Jehovah first hand,

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.810
he had Jehovah's help in his life.

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:32.810
How?

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.810
Well, consider what Paul faced on his first missionary tour.

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.810
An exciting assignment laid before Paul,

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.810
Barnabas, and their traveling companions.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.810
Would it be a light load full of only good experiences?

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.810
Or would this assignment involve challenges?

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.810
Some perhaps heavier than he anticipated.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.810
Let's find out.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:05.810
One of Paul's first stops was Pasidian Antioch.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:09.810
Here, Paul and his companions had great success.

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.810
In fact, the people begged them to come back

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.810
on the next Sabbath to tell them more.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.810
That seems like a light load to carry, doesn't it?

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.810
But Paul's return visit did not go as smoothly

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.810
as he probably expected.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.810
While some accepted the good news,

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.810
a poser stirred up the crowd to the extent

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:38.810
that Paul and his companions were thrown out of the city.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.810
Paul's next stop was Iconium,

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:47.810
about a 100 mile or 160 kilometer trip from Antioch.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:52.810
Paul couldn't take a train, a bus, or a taxi.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:55.810
He had to travel on foot.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:59.810
Things go better for him when he got to Iconium.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.810
Would his preaching there be a lighter load to carry

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:05.810
than it was in Antioch?

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.810
Well, some did accept his message,

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:12.810
but then a poser stirred up opposition

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:17.810
before long Paul and his companions had to flee again.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:22.810
This time, they walked 20 miles or about 30 kilometers

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.810
to Listera.

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:27.810
At first, things went well there.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:31.810
After Paul and Barnabas were mistaken for gods,

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:35.809
they gave a skillful witness to the people of Listera

00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:38.809
about their powerful creator.

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:42.809
But then, the imposers from Antioch

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:45.809
and Iconium came after Paul.

00:08:45.809 --> 00:08:48.809
Some of them hated Paul so much,

00:08:48.809 --> 00:08:53.809
they walked over 100 miles or 160 kilometers

00:08:53.809 --> 00:08:56.809
to attack him.

00:08:56.809 --> 00:08:59.809
When they found him, they stoned Paul

00:08:59.809 --> 00:09:04.809
and dragged him out of the city, leaving him for dead.

00:09:04.809 --> 00:09:09.809
Did Paul think that this load was getting too heavy to carry?

00:09:09.809 --> 00:09:12.809
Did he cave into discouragement because

00:09:12.809 --> 00:09:17.809
the imposers hated him and even attacked him physically?

00:09:17.809 --> 00:09:19.809
No.

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:22.809
Paul had endurance.

00:09:22.809 --> 00:09:26.809
And a person who endures never gives up hope,

00:09:26.809 --> 00:09:29.809
even in the face of persecution.

00:09:29.809 --> 00:09:32.809
So what did Paul do?

00:09:32.809 --> 00:09:37.809
He continued right on with preaching this time in Derby.

00:09:37.809 --> 00:09:41.809
Just imagine the effort Paul had to exert

00:09:41.809 --> 00:09:46.809
about the 60 miles or about 100 kilometers to Derby

00:09:46.809 --> 00:09:51.809
the day after he had almost been stoned to death.

00:09:51.809 --> 00:09:54.809
However, the trip was worth the effort

00:09:54.809 --> 00:09:58.809
because while in Derby, Paul and his companions

00:09:58.809 --> 00:10:01.809
made many disciples.

00:10:01.809 --> 00:10:06.809
As you can see, Paul had a heavy load to carry

00:10:06.809 --> 00:10:09.809
but he didn't give up.

00:10:09.809 --> 00:10:11.809
He continued preaching.

00:10:11.809 --> 00:10:15.809
But then, Paul did something more.

00:10:15.809 --> 00:10:19.809
Open your Bible to Acts chapter 14.

00:10:19.809 --> 00:10:23.809
Here we see something that proved Paul

00:10:23.809 --> 00:10:26.809
to be a man of endurance.

00:10:26.809 --> 00:10:31.809
At Acts chapter 14 and verse 21, we read,

00:10:31.809 --> 00:10:34.809
After declaring the good news to that city

00:10:34.809 --> 00:10:37.809
and making quite a few disciples,

00:10:37.809 --> 00:10:40.809
they returned to Listera,

00:10:40.809 --> 00:10:43.809
Iconium, and Antioch.

00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:48.809
Imagine Paul and his companions walked back

00:10:48.809 --> 00:10:52.809
to the very cities where they had been viciously persecuted.

00:10:52.809 --> 00:10:54.809
Why?

00:10:54.809 --> 00:10:57.809
Verse 22 says,

00:10:57.809 --> 00:11:00.809
There they strengthened the disciples,

00:11:00.809 --> 00:11:03.809
encouraging them to remain in the faith

00:11:03.809 --> 00:11:07.809
and saying, We must enter into the kingdom of God

00:11:07.809 --> 00:11:11.809
through many tribulations.

00:11:11.809 --> 00:11:15.809
At first, that statement might seem strange.

00:11:15.809 --> 00:11:18.809
How could Paul encourage the disciples

00:11:18.809 --> 00:11:22.809
by telling them that they would have many tribulations?

00:11:22.809 --> 00:11:27.809
That prospect would seem depressing, not encouraging,

00:11:27.809 --> 00:11:31.809
but look carefully at Paul's words.

00:11:31.809 --> 00:11:36.809
He didn't simply say, We must endure many tribulations.

00:11:36.809 --> 00:11:41.809
He said, We must enter into the kingdom of God

00:11:41.809 --> 00:11:44.809
through many tribulations.

00:11:44.809 --> 00:11:48.809
In other words, Paul strengthened the disciples

00:11:48.809 --> 00:11:53.809
by emphasizing the positive result of endurance.

00:11:53.809 --> 00:11:58.809
As Jesus said at Matthew chapter 10 verse 22,

00:11:58.809 --> 00:12:04.809
The one who has endured to the end will be saved.

00:12:04.809 --> 00:12:07.809
What's the lesson for us?

00:12:07.809 --> 00:12:11.809
Endurance is not just a matter of toughing it out

00:12:11.809 --> 00:12:13.809
under a difficult situation.

00:12:13.809 --> 00:12:18.809
Endurance means keeping our hope bright in our mind.

00:12:18.809 --> 00:12:21.809
It means being personally convinced

00:12:21.809 --> 00:12:26.809
that as 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and verse 17 says,

00:12:26.809 --> 00:12:31.809
The tribulation is momentary and light,

00:12:31.809 --> 00:12:35.809
but the reward is everlasting.
