00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.660
An introduction to Second Kings

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:12.660
Attributed to Jeremiah, Second Kings begins where First Kings ends.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:22.660
The account spans some 340 years from about 920 to 580 BCE when the writing was completed.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:29.660
The book describes the spiritual decline of both Israel and Judah until both kingdoms were taken into exile.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:38.600
In chapter 2, the prophet Elijah is taken up in a windstorm.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.600
His attendant Elisha succeeds him.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.600
In chapters 4 and 5, Elisha resurrects the son of a Shunamite woman.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.600
Elisha also miraculously feeds 100 people with 20 loaves of bread and a bag of grain

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.600
and he heals Syrian army chief Nehemen of leprosy.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.599
In chapter 6, a military force from Syria is searching for Elisha.

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:11.599
They surround Dothan where he and his attendant are staying.

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:20.599
Jehovah opens the eyes of the fearful attendant so that he sees war chariots of fire all around Elisha.

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:25.599
In chapter 9, Jehu is anointed as King of Israel.

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:33.599
He is commanded to strike down the house of Ahab, which includes Ahab's widow, Jezebel.

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:42.599
In chapter 11, Ahab's daughter, Athalia, usurps the throne in Judah and attempts to eliminate the royal line.

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:49.599
However, high priest Jehoiada and his wife rescue the infant Jehoash.

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:57.599
When Jehoash is seven years old, he is made king and Athalia is put to death.

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:06.599
In chapter 15, Assyrian king Tiglath Pelesar III invades the northern kingdom and takes many into exile.

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:15.599
In chapter 17, Assyrian king Shalmanizir also invades Israel and takes the remaining people away captive.

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:29.990
Did you know? In an effort to discourage future uprisings, these Assyrian kings removed captives from conquered lands and replaced them with foreigners.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:37.360
Those transplanted into Samaria became known as Samaritans.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:45.360
In chapter 18, Hezekiah becomes King of Judah. He does what is right in God's eyes.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:54.360
In Hezekiah's 14th year, Assyrian king Sinakirub invades Judah and threatens Jerusalem.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:05.360
In chapter 19, Jehovah reveals to the prophet Isaiah that he will defend the city. Isaiah then sends God's message to Hezekiah.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:13.360
On that very night, Jehovah's Angel strikes down 185,000 men in the Assyrian camp.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:26.360
In chapter 21, Hezekiah's 12-year-old son Manasseh becomes King. He disobeys Jehovah on a grand scale, even making his own son pass through the fire.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:37.360
In chapter 22, after the death of Manasseh and his son Aiman, 8-year-old Josiah becomes King. He does what is right in God's eyes.

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:52.669
The last three chapters of 2 Kings discuss the final four kings of Judah. Jehovah has, Jehovah Kim, Jehovah Kim and Zedekiah, all disobeye Jehovah.

00:03:52.669 --> 00:04:01.669
In chapter 24, during Jehovah Kim's three-month reign, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon besieges Jerusalem.

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:10.669
Jehovah Kim surrenders and is taken to Babylon with his princes, court officials, and servants.

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:18.670
In chapter 25, during Zedekiah's reign, Nebuchadnezzar attacks Jerusalem the second time.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:28.670
The Babylonians burn down the temple, pull down the city walls, and take Zedekiah to Babylon with the surviving Jews.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:38.670
Gedaliah is appointed governor over the few lowly ones who remain in Judah. However, he is assassinated and the people flee to Egypt.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:53.180
As you read 2 Kings, note the hardships that bad rulers caused their subjects. See how Jehovah blessed the kings who loved him.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:05:02.180
And read how he preserved the family line of David, which produced the one who later became King of God's Kingdom.
