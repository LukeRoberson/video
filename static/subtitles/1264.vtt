00:00:53.619 --> 00:01:02.619
O Jehovah, our God, save us out of his hands so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone, our God, O Jehovah.

00:01:02.619 --> 00:03:28.449
So you know that David wasn't much older than you, boys, when he went up against Goliath.

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:31.449
Can you imagine going up against such a huge giant?

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:34.449
Just how big was he, King Hezekiah?

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:41.449
Well, he was this tall. His shoulders were this wide, his sword was sharp, and it was this long.

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:43.449
David must have been scared.

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:45.449
A little. Do you remember what he said to Saul?

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:50.449
David said, I killed the bear and the lion. Jehovah won't be killed Goliath.

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:51.449
And then what happened?

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:57.449
I know. David puts five stones in a bag, and he says, I am coming to you in the name of Jehovah.

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:03.449
Then he takes the stone out of his bag, and he slings it with all his power and my apple-eyed setting kills him.

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:07.449
And then he cuts off his head. I want to be brave like David.

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:10.449
It can be if you trust in Jehovah just like David did.

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:18.879
And remember, with Jehovah on our side, anything is possible. What have we here?

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:22.879
I found it in the garden over there. It can't fly. What should I do?

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:28.879
It's a young turtle dove. Perhaps it fell out of its nest. You need to keep it close and warm.

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:30.879
And promise me something.

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:32.879
My Lord, a moment, please.

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:36.949
What is it, Jazeel?

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:38.949
A man has to survive from some area.

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:41.949
Is it as we expected?

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:46.949
Bring him to my council chamber. Gather my advisors. Call Isaiah to. But do so quietly.

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:48.949
We don't want people to panic.

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:58.370
What was I supposed to promise?

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.370
Oh, yes. This is important. You have to promise me not to keep the bird locked up in a cage.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.370
When it can fly, set it free.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.370
I promise.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.370
Good. Now I must go.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.370
Goodbye.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:26.910
Oh, okay.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:27.910
Please, Stan.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.350
I'm your brother. This is Jazeel with the army.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:37.350
These are my advisors. You like him and Shabna. And this is Isaiah. What is your name?

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.350
I'm Joel. My Lord.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.350
Joel, please. What happened in the Samaria?

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.350
The Assyrians. They finally broke through the wall.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.350
They hacked off hands and arms, heads.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.350
They singled out the leading man of the city and they skinned them alive.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.350
How did you escape?

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.350
I disguised myself as one of the Assyrian soldiers.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.350
And what of the survivors?

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.730
I didn't have time to see much.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.730
But the Assyrians were gathering people together.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.730
I suppose they were taking them as captives.

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:16.290
And they bound their heads with strips of leather.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:21.910
My wife. My dear wife.

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.910
And my son's and my little daughter.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.910
Oh, those are arriving from the north.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:27.910
How many?

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:28.910
More than a hundred so far.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:36.350
I'm so very sorry, my brother.

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.329
You like him?

00:06:40.329 --> 00:06:42.329
Please see that this man has taken care of him.

00:06:42.329 --> 00:06:43.329
Food and rest.

00:06:43.329 --> 00:06:45.329
See that the others are cared for as well.

00:06:45.329 --> 00:06:46.329
Yes, my Lord.

00:06:46.329 --> 00:06:47.329
Thank you.

00:06:47.329 --> 00:06:49.899
Thank you.

00:06:49.899 --> 00:07:08.649
Three years since the Assyrians first laid siege to Samaria.

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:12.649
Three years behind those walls.

00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:14.649
What happened to Samaria?

00:07:14.649 --> 00:07:16.649
It could happen to us.

00:07:16.649 --> 00:07:18.649
How could you have allowed this to happen?

00:07:18.649 --> 00:07:21.649
It happened because Samaria broke its alliance to the king of Assyria.

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:24.649
They stopped paying the early tribute just as we had.

00:07:24.649 --> 00:07:27.649
These things came upon them because they sinned against Jehovah.

00:07:27.649 --> 00:07:28.649
The king is right.

00:07:28.649 --> 00:07:32.649
From King Amri's day, the people in Samaria have served false gods.

00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:35.649
They openly practiced idolatry.

00:07:35.649 --> 00:07:38.649
Jehovah foretold that these consequences would come upon them.

00:07:38.649 --> 00:07:40.649
But again and again, they rejected his warnings.

00:07:40.649 --> 00:07:42.649
You're saying they were being punished by Jehovah?

00:07:42.649 --> 00:07:46.649
I'm saying that if they were loyal to Jehovah, this would not have happened.

00:07:46.649 --> 00:07:48.649
What happened to Samaria will not happen to us.

00:07:48.649 --> 00:07:51.649
It was right to break ties with Assyria.

00:07:51.649 --> 00:07:53.649
Our trust is in Jehovah.

00:07:53.649 --> 00:07:55.649
Of course we must trust in Jehovah.

00:07:55.649 --> 00:07:56.649
Of course we will.

00:07:56.649 --> 00:07:58.649
But there will be consequences.

00:07:58.649 --> 00:08:00.649
The Assyrians will come for us.

00:08:00.649 --> 00:08:03.649
It's wise to take practical measures.

00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:09.649
Do not solemn and say the shrewd person sees the danger and does something about it.

00:08:09.649 --> 00:08:11.649
Perhaps we could ask Egypt.

00:08:11.649 --> 00:08:12.649
No.

00:08:12.649 --> 00:08:14.649
Remember our history, Shabna?

00:08:14.649 --> 00:08:16.649
King Assyria leaned on Assyria.

00:08:16.649 --> 00:08:18.649
And Jehaasuf had aligned himself with Ahem.

00:08:18.649 --> 00:08:20.649
Jehovah rebuked both of them.

00:08:20.649 --> 00:08:24.649
Our first concern is to care for the refugees from Samaria.

00:08:24.649 --> 00:08:26.649
Let us go and see what can be done.

00:08:26.649 --> 00:09:09.720
My great king, the couriers, have brought tribute from King Asarden.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:17.720
10,000 cattle, 5,000 sheep, 2,000 camels, 1,000 horses, 300 wagons filled with iron from their deposits.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.720
10,000?

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.639
300 wagons of iron.

00:09:23.639 --> 00:09:26.980
We demand 500.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.980
The king begs for your mercy and forgiveness in the matter.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:31.980
He apologizes for any delay.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.980
I'm only for apologies.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:34.980
I need iron.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.980
God, iron, I cannot equip my army.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:40.980
Without an army, I cannot gather slaves to work in the fields.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.980
He begs for my patience.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.980
He should be begging for his life.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:51.000
Kill all his children.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Tell him I will do the same to him if he does not send me the remaining 200 wagons within 60 days.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
As you wish, my lord.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.750
What is this?

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.750
Why is there no trippy from Judah?

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.750
Ah, yes.

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:08.750
The king in Jerusalem refuses to pay.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:10.750
He refuses?

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.750
Yes, his name is Hezekiah.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:15.750
He is not like his father Ahaz, who was loyal to us.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:19.750
He is struck down Felistine cities that were allied to us, including Akra.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:23.750
Your loyal subject, King Paddai, is now a prisoner in Jerusalem.

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:24.750
Hezekiah.

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:35.710
They are due to you.

00:10:35.710 --> 00:11:34.830
We continue to advance.

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:37.830
They already hold the territory to our north.

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:41.830
We believe the Assyrians will go on to subdue the city's south and west of us.

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:44.830
My lord, some cities are giving up without a fight.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:46.830
The enemy is taking captives in large numbers.

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.830
Public torture and execution are persuasive.

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:51.830
Some cities simply open their gates.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:54.830
It is likely the Assyrians will approach Jerusalem from the south.

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:59.830
But before they could successfully attack Jerusalem, they would have to take Leakish.

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:01.830
Otherwise they risk having Leakish at their backs.

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:03.830
Might Egypt fight against him?

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:04.830
That is the possibility.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:05.830
Yes.

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:07.830
Egyptian army is strong.

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:09.830
Perhaps it's time to consider a coalition.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:13.830
With Egypt and Leakish beside us, we could make a strong stand against the Syria.

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:15.830
I will make no alliance with Egypt.

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:17.830
However, we do need to prepare.

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.830
Rizia, your chief of the army, what do you suggest?

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:23.830
We cannot defeat the Assyrians in open warfare.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.830
We must prepare for a siege.

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:27.830
The walls of Jerusalem need to be strengthened.

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:31.830
Also, a suggest we build a second wall to provide added protection.

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:32.830
What else?

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:34.830
We need more shields and defensive weapons.

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:35.830
Agreed.

00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:40.269
Then there's the matter of water.

00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:44.480
I've thought of that.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.480
Water flows to the fields outside the city.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:52.480
Our engineers say that a tunnel can be dug to divert the water to the pool of salome inside the city walls.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:56.480
If the Assyrians do come here, why should we provide water for them?

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.480
We must move quickly.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.480
Make arrangements immediately.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:08.580
My brothers, we need not fear the king of Assyrian all the multitude that are with him.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.580
For there are more with us than there are with him.

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:17.580
With him is an army of flesh, but with us is our God Jehovah to help us and to fight our battles.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:14:07.870
But I, a king of Akron wants to speak with you.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:29.740
You wish to speak with me, Paddai?

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:30.740
What do you want?

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:37.659
I want you to release me, to send me back to Ekron to reclaim my kingship.

00:14:37.659 --> 00:14:39.659
Why should I do that?

00:14:39.659 --> 00:14:44.480
The Assyrian army is coming.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.480
I can help you.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.480
I can speak to the king's inaccurate on your behalf.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.480
I know him.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.480
Maybe he will be merciful to you.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.480
I will never kiss the feet of one who enslaved and murdered our people.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.480
I am not like you.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.480
You contemptible worm.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:04.480
If I am a worm, I am a smart worm as a kind of you are a fool.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.480
You have no idea the heart that you're bringing upon your people.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.480
The Assyrians are like a locus plague devouring all in its path.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:19.480
They will smash through these walls, torture your mighty men, rape your women and slay your children.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.480
And what do you think they will do to you, Hezekiah?

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.480
You can not imagine what they will do to you.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.480
You will see Hezekiah.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.480
Terror is coming.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:59.759
Who killed us all?

00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:40.860
Isaiah, I've known you all my life.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.860
You always helped me and guided me.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:44.860
I'm deeply troubled.

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:46.860
These are critical times.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:17:00.220
Sit down my son.

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:01.220
Tell me.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.220
What's in your heart?

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:06.220
City after city is falling to the Assyrians.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.220
But you know that.

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.220
I brought this upon our people.

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:16.220
Shevna warned me that there would be consequences if I rebelled against Assyria and he was right.

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:18.220
There's so much suffering.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.220
I am to blame.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:23.220
Was it wrong to rebelled against Assyria?

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:26.220
It's never a mistake to trust God.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:29.220
Your father was a puppet in the hands of Assyria.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:32.220
You though have always put your trust in Jehovah.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:36.220
Since the day you became king, you've worked to reestablish pure worship in our land.

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.220
You repaired and reopened the temple.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.220
You destroyed the sacred pillars.

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:43.220
You pulled down the high places and altars and cut down the sacred poles.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.220
This is the right thing to do.

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:48.220
And now you're constantly with the people of our city.

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:50.220
Encouraging and strengthening and understating faithful.

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.220
And so do you, but now are people in other cities suffer.

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.220
Why?

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.220
Well, I think you know the answer to that.

00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:11.029
But let me show you something.

00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:16.029
You gave me this when you were just a child learning to write.

00:18:16.029 --> 00:18:19.730
You kept this all these years.

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:21.730
To you, Jehovah, I turn.

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:24.730
My God, I trust in you.

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:26.730
This is the Son of David.

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:28.730
Yes, and you've always trusted in Jehovah.

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:30.730
And he's blessed you greatly.

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:32.730
I do read from the law every day.

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.730
And you know that the law warned the consequences of unfaithfulness.

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:38.730
There's still much unfaithfulness among our people.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:48.529
You've instituted reforms, but the people have been half-hearted in applying them.

00:18:48.529 --> 00:18:51.529
I keep thinking about what it says in our law.

00:18:52.529 --> 00:18:56.529
That Jehovah will bring punishment for the heir of fathers upon future generations.

00:18:56.529 --> 00:18:58.529
My father filled this city with idols.

00:18:58.529 --> 00:19:01.529
He sacrificed my brothers to a Canaanite God.

00:19:01.529 --> 00:19:02.529
I remember well.

00:19:02.529 --> 00:19:04.529
That was a dreadful time.

00:19:04.529 --> 00:19:10.809
Would Jerusalem now suffer for the heir of former generations?

00:19:10.809 --> 00:19:13.809
Trust in Jehovah, Hezekiah.

00:19:13.809 --> 00:19:16.809
He never disappoints those who are loyal to him.

00:19:16.809 --> 00:19:21.089
I need more faith.

00:19:21.089 --> 00:19:23.089
Keep it, Hezekiah.

00:19:23.089 --> 00:19:46.430
Never forget what you wrote as a boy.

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:49.430
Your faithfulness can be a positive example, Hezekiah.

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:54.430
Not just for our people today, but for generations to come.

00:19:54.430 --> 00:20:46.670
They wish will fall.

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:50.670
These serians moved siege engines in place and are pounding the wall with battering ramps.

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:53.670
Their soldiers attempt to scale the wall with ladders.

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:56.670
Jerusalem will be next.

00:20:56.670 --> 00:21:00.670
Rizia, tell me, can Jerusalem withstand a siege?

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:03.670
Stalk piles of food.

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:05.670
Our walls are strong and we can defend them.

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:06.670
We're as prepared as we can be.

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:09.670
But the same could have been said for Lekish.

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:10.670
You like him.

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:12.670
What is the spirit of the people of Jerusalem?

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:15.670
There is great fear in the city as a guy and with good reason.

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:17.670
There's nowhere to flee.

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:19.670
Many of the people say we should surrender.

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:23.670
We will never open our gates to these hated men and allow them to desecrate our temple.

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:25.670
Never.

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:28.670
Jehovah will save us just as he did our forefathers at the Red Sea.

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:30.670
Jehovah did not save Samaria.

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:33.670
He has not saved the cities and towns of Judah.

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:35.670
Now it seems he will not save Lekish.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:40.670
How long will we have faith that Jehovah will provide a way out?

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:46.670
What if an alliance with Egypt was our way out?

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:49.670
But we failed to take it when we could have.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:51.670
There may be another option.

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:57.670
Senacrob is coming against us because we refuse to pay tribute to him if we offer him money.

00:21:57.670 --> 00:21:58.670
No.

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:01.670
If we give him money, he will expect us to do his bidding.

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:05.670
If we paid the tribute, we wouldn't need to surrender and we wouldn't need to fight.

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:23.200
Could this be the answer we're looking for?

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.200
Jazeel.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.200
I want you to lead a delegation to the Assyrian forces.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:32.200
Go to them at Lekish and ask them what they would take to withdraw from us.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.200
Do not promise them anything.

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:50.460
The Gray Senacrob has favorably heard your request.

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:55.460
He demands that you deliver to him here, 300 talents of silver and 30 talents of gold.

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.460
King Senacrob not consider a lesser amount.

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.460
You are in no position to bargain.

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:02.460
Our king has authorized us to pay a generous tribute.

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.460
But what you're asking for is too much.

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.460
Be glad that the king has not the man in your head.

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:09.460
If you do not bring the money, he will take it from you and you will die.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:10.460
One other matter.

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:12.460
You are to release to us King Pada.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.460
It is the will of the king that he returned to Africa.

00:23:14.460 --> 00:24:55.819
When you delivered the money, did the Assyrian say anything to you?

00:24:55.819 --> 00:24:56.819
They said nothing.

00:24:56.819 --> 00:24:58.819
They just took the wagons with the money.

00:24:58.819 --> 00:25:00.819
Where is Jazeel?

00:25:00.819 --> 00:25:02.819
The Assyrians demanded they stay behind.

00:25:02.819 --> 00:25:03.819
I didn't say why.

00:25:03.819 --> 00:25:04.819
This is not good.

00:25:04.819 --> 00:25:06.819
I worry about his safety.

00:25:06.819 --> 00:25:08.819
So do I.

00:25:08.819 --> 00:25:10.819
But I am thankful.

00:25:10.819 --> 00:25:12.819
We have an agreement now.

00:25:12.819 --> 00:25:13.819
Jerusalem will be spared a siege.

00:25:13.819 --> 00:25:14.819
The cost was heavy.

00:25:14.819 --> 00:25:16.819
The treasuries are empty.

00:25:16.819 --> 00:25:19.819
Still, that money bought our very lives.

00:25:19.819 --> 00:25:42.109
You do not stand before the king.

00:25:43.109 --> 00:25:49.720
My lord, his weapon.

00:25:49.720 --> 00:26:09.529
So you are the man from Jerusalem.

00:26:09.529 --> 00:26:15.920
And this is your sword.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:18.920
It's made of bronze.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:20.920
Not iron.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:25.920
In Nineveh, our children play with swords like these.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:37.259
I'm curious about this.

00:26:37.259 --> 00:26:39.259
King of yours.

00:26:39.259 --> 00:26:42.259
Who does he think will come to save him from me?

00:26:42.259 --> 00:26:46.150
What do you think?

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:47.150
Rapshaka Adar.

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:50.150
He hopes that Egypt will rescue him.

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:52.150
Is that true?

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:53.150
Man of Jerusalem?

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:54.150
No.

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:55.150
It is not.

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:56.150
No.

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:57.150
Our king, trust him.

00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:59.150
We trust in Jehovah.

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:00.150
Yes.

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:01.150
Jehovah.

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:03.150
You trust in him to save you.

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:09.589
But if you trust in your God to save you, then why is it?

00:27:09.589 --> 00:27:11.589
You bring me.

00:27:11.589 --> 00:27:15.589
Silver and gold so that I should turn away from you.

00:27:15.589 --> 00:27:21.180
But let us talk about.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.180
Jehovah was not Jehovah.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.180
The God of Samaria.

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:30.180
Which my father reduced to rubble.

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:40.180
This is not Jehovah.

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:46.420
The God of the cities of Judah.

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.420
Which I have now conquered.

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:49.420
Yes.

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:51.420
And this is not Jehovah.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:54.420
The God of Lakeish.

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:56.420
Whose walls?

00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:00.420
We will soon smash.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:02.420
Terrible.

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:04.700
Yes.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:09.700
I can't hear you.

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:11.700
Yes.

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:15.430
Jehovah.

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:19.430
Your God is weak.

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:24.430
He will cringe before my God, Asher.

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:51.859
Just as you cringe before me now.

00:28:51.859 --> 00:28:53.859
Lakeish also.

00:28:53.859 --> 00:28:55.859
Do not fear death.

00:28:55.859 --> 00:29:00.930
They will commit.

00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:08.700
They will take it to see them.

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:13.700
You can see the imaginative ways.

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:17.700
We discipline those who anger us.

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:27.230
Then I will send you back to Jerusalem to report what you have seen here.

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:30.230
You know what people understand.

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:37.339
What we do to those who resist.

00:29:37.339 --> 00:29:40.339
They will throw open their gates to us when we come.

00:29:40.339 --> 00:29:43.339
We had an agreement.

00:29:43.339 --> 00:29:45.339
Am I a mule?

00:29:45.339 --> 00:29:47.339
That can be bought from money?

00:29:47.339 --> 00:29:55.420
Right.

00:29:55.420 --> 00:31:14.589
Rebellion.

00:31:14.589 --> 00:31:16.589
To you, Jehovah, I turn.

00:31:16.589 --> 00:31:18.589
My God, I trust in you.

00:31:18.589 --> 00:31:19.589
It's a Psalm of David.

00:31:19.589 --> 00:31:24.660
David must have been scared.

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:25.660
A little.

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:26.660
Do you remember what he said to Saul?

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:28.660
Jehovah won't let me kill Goliath.

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:35.410
David puts five stones in a bag and he says,

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:37.410
I am coming to you in the name of Jehovah.

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:50.359
I want to be brave like David.

00:31:50.359 --> 00:31:53.359
You can be if you trust in Jehovah just like David did.

00:31:53.359 --> 00:31:56.359
And remember, with Jehovah on our side,

00:31:56.359 --> 00:32:22.680
anything is possible.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.680
Jazil.

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:24.680
Are you all right?

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:25.680
You look terrible.

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:26.680
I'm fine.

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.680
But the Assyrians, they betrayed us.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:29.680
They're coming.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.680
My Lord, the King.

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.680
There's a large military force of Assyrians outside the gates.

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.680
They've demanded that you come to speak with them.

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:38.119
See to it that this man is taking care of.

00:32:38.119 --> 00:32:39.119
Rest, Jazil.

00:32:39.119 --> 00:32:40.119
You've done well.

00:32:40.119 --> 00:32:41.119
We'll talk later.

00:32:41.119 --> 00:32:43.119
I must go out to them.

00:32:43.119 --> 00:32:44.119
No, please, my Lord.

00:32:44.119 --> 00:32:45.119
Don't you go.

00:32:45.119 --> 00:32:46.119
No.

00:32:46.119 --> 00:32:47.119
They will take you away.

00:32:47.119 --> 00:32:48.119
Send me.

00:32:48.119 --> 00:32:58.210
Take Shabna.

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:00.210
Enjoy the recorder.

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:02.210
Do not give the answer to them.

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:04.210
Listen and report back to me.

00:33:04.210 --> 00:34:02.150
Is what the great King,

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:06.150
the King of Assyria says.

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:10.150
What is the basis for your confidence?

00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:13.150
You are saying I have a strategy

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:16.150
and the power to age war.

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:20.719
But these are empty words.

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:22.719
In whom have you put your trust

00:34:22.719 --> 00:34:27.719
so that you dare to rebel against me?

00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:31.719
Now, is it without authorization

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:33.719
from Jehovah?

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:36.719
That I have come up against this place to destroy it?

00:34:36.719 --> 00:34:39.719
Jehovah himself said to me.

00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:43.719
Go up against this land and destroy it.

00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:45.719
Speak to your servants, please,

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:47.719
in the Aramaic language,

00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:48.719
for we can understand it.

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:51.719
Do not speak to us in the language of the Jews

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:53.719
and the hearing of the people on the wall.

00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:56.719
Is it just to your Lord

00:34:56.719 --> 00:35:01.719
and to you that my Lord has sent me to speak these words?

00:35:01.719 --> 00:35:05.719
Is it not also to the men who sit on the wall

00:35:05.719 --> 00:35:08.719
those who will eat their own excrement

00:35:08.719 --> 00:35:13.719
and drink their own urine along with you?

00:35:13.719 --> 00:35:20.760
Do not listen to Hezekiah.

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:25.760
For this is what the King of Assyria says.

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:28.760
Make peace with me and surrender

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:32.760
and each of you will lead from his own vine

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.760
and from his own fig tree.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.760
Have any of the gods of the nations

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.760
rescued their land out of the hand

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.760
of the King of Assyria?

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.760
Who among all the gods of these nations

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:49.760
have rescued their land out of my hand

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:53.760
so that Jehovah should rescue Jerusalem

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:56.760
out of my hand?

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:59.760
We will report your words to our King.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:25.440
Did he say anything else?

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.440
No, that was all.

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.440
How are the people in Jerusalem reacting?

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:32.440
They are terrified.

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.440
They thought we all thought

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.440
that the Assyrians would leave us alone.

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:38.440
Some are saying we should surrender

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:41.440
but most are looking to you Hezekiah.

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:44.440
Rizia, how do you see our situation?

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:47.440
We have done everything we can to prepare for siege.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.440
But the Assyrian siege engines are immense.

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.440
Jerusalem can withstand a siege for a time

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.440
but without Jehovah's help it does not look good for us.

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:56.440
How long can the Assyrians sustain a siege?

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.440
Their siege of Samaria lasted three years.

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:00.440
It seems that they have a network of supply lines

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:03.440
that provide their forces with food and water.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.440
My brothers, we must remember

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.440
that Jehovah is fully able to rescue

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.440
as just as he has in times past.

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:13.710
He is the kind of...

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:16.710
We are not even now face the facts.

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:17.710
We are trapped.

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:22.309
We are like birds in a cage.

00:37:22.309 --> 00:37:24.309
Either we open the door to the cage ourselves

00:37:24.309 --> 00:37:26.309
or we keep it closed.

00:37:26.309 --> 00:37:28.309
I told Sniper Brips it open.

00:37:28.309 --> 00:37:30.309
You have been suggesting that we surrender?

00:37:30.309 --> 00:37:32.309
I cannot give Jehovah's holy city

00:37:32.309 --> 00:37:34.309
over to men who taunt the living God.

00:37:34.309 --> 00:37:36.309
To men who will profane the temple of Jehovah

00:37:36.309 --> 00:37:38.309
and carry off his spoil, the Ark of the Covenant.

00:37:38.309 --> 00:37:40.309
No, we will not surrender.

00:37:40.309 --> 00:37:44.309
All the cities of Judah have been defeated.

00:37:44.309 --> 00:37:47.309
Thousands have been taken away.

00:37:47.309 --> 00:37:50.309
Man, women, children,

00:37:50.309 --> 00:37:52.309
these Syrians are at our gate

00:37:52.309 --> 00:37:55.309
and you'll cling to the belief that nothing bad will happen.

00:37:55.309 --> 00:37:58.820
Do you not understand?

00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:01.820
You will destroy everything you so hope to preserve.

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:04.820
The temple of Jerusalem, our very lives.

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:07.820
Shedna, I'm not blind to the dangers that we face.

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:10.820
I too am afraid.

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:14.820
But if Jehovah allows Jerusalem to fall so beat,

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:48.280
how can we give up what belongs to Jehovah?

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.280
O Jehovah our God,

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.280
please see our peril.

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:57.300
Take notice of how our enemy is taunting you.

00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.300
We look to you to deliver us.

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:02.300
We know you are the supreme one.

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:04.300
Act in behalf of your holy name.

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:11.030
Please.

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:13.030
Help us.

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:15.030
And give me courage to do your will.

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:42.500
Please, go to Isaiah.

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:45.500
Take with you some of the elders in the priests.

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:47.500
Clothe yourselves with satcloth and ask Isaiah

00:39:47.500 --> 00:40:12.449
for the word of Jehovah.

00:40:12.449 --> 00:40:13.449
Isaiah, my brother.

00:40:13.449 --> 00:40:15.449
This is what Hezekiah says.

00:40:15.449 --> 00:40:18.449
This day is a day of distress.

00:40:18.449 --> 00:40:21.449
And perhaps Jehovah your God will hear the words

00:40:21.449 --> 00:40:24.449
of the rabshaka whom the king of Assyria, his Lord,

00:40:24.449 --> 00:40:27.449
sent to taunt the living God.

00:40:27.449 --> 00:40:29.449
And he will call him to account for the words

00:40:29.449 --> 00:40:31.449
that Jehovah your God has heard.

00:40:31.449 --> 00:40:34.449
So offer up a prayer on behalf of the remnant

00:40:34.449 --> 00:40:36.449
who has survived.

00:40:36.449 --> 00:40:39.449
This is what Jehovah says.

00:40:39.449 --> 00:40:42.449
Do not be afraid because of the words that you've heard.

00:40:42.449 --> 00:40:45.449
The words with which the attendants of the king of Assyria

00:40:45.449 --> 00:40:46.449
blaspheme me.

00:40:46.449 --> 00:40:48.449
I am putting a thought in his mind.

00:40:48.449 --> 00:40:50.449
And he will hear a report.

00:40:51.449 --> 00:40:53.449
And return to his own land.

00:40:53.449 --> 00:40:56.449
And I will make him follow by the sword in his own land.

00:40:56.449 --> 00:41:00.559
Thank you, Isaiah.

00:41:00.559 --> 00:41:01.559
Thank you.

00:41:01.559 --> 00:41:49.289
King of the world.

00:41:49.289 --> 00:41:50.289
I am Hezekiah.

00:41:50.289 --> 00:41:52.289
What word do you have for me?

00:41:52.289 --> 00:41:54.289
This is what the mighty Sannacherin,

00:41:54.289 --> 00:41:57.289
favorite of the great gods, says to you.

00:41:57.289 --> 00:42:01.289
Do not let your God in whom you trust, deceive you.

00:42:01.289 --> 00:42:03.289
By saying Jerusalem will not be delivered

00:42:03.289 --> 00:42:05.289
into the hand of the Syrians.

00:42:05.289 --> 00:42:07.289
Look, you have heard what the kings of Assyria did

00:42:07.289 --> 00:42:10.289
to all the lands by devoting them to destruction.

00:42:10.289 --> 00:42:12.289
Will you alone be rescued?

00:42:12.289 --> 00:42:15.289
Do the gods of the nations that my forefather destroyed?

00:42:15.289 --> 00:42:16.289
Rescue them?

00:42:16.289 --> 00:42:17.289
Where are?

00:42:17.289 --> 00:42:18.289
Gozan?

00:42:18.289 --> 00:42:19.289
Hey, Rand.

00:42:19.289 --> 00:42:20.289
Riza.

00:42:20.289 --> 00:42:22.289
And the people of Eden who are until Asar.

00:42:22.289 --> 00:42:23.289
Where's the king of Haymat?

00:42:23.289 --> 00:42:24.289
The king of Arpad?

00:42:24.289 --> 00:42:26.289
And the king of the cities of Safarvam?

00:42:26.289 --> 00:42:28.289
And of Hina?

00:42:28.289 --> 00:42:29.289
And of Iva?

00:42:29.289 --> 00:43:58.900
I was Jehovah the God of Israel,

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:00.900
sitting and thrown above the cherubs.

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:03.900
You alone are the true God of all the kingdoms of Israel.

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:07.900
Here, all the words that Sannacherin has sent

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:09.900
to taunt the living God.

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:30.539
The Syrians have devastated the nations in their lands.

00:44:30.539 --> 00:44:35.019
But now, O Jehovah our God,

00:44:35.019 --> 00:44:38.019
please save us out of his hands

00:44:38.019 --> 00:44:40.019
so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know

00:44:40.019 --> 00:44:44.019
that you alone are God, O Jehovah.

00:44:44.019 --> 00:45:02.429
You have come from Isaiah?

00:45:02.429 --> 00:45:03.429
Yes, my Lord.

00:45:03.429 --> 00:45:06.429
He says, this is what Jehovah says about the king of Assyria.

00:45:06.429 --> 00:45:10.429
The virgin daughter of Zion despises you.

00:45:10.429 --> 00:45:12.429
She scoffs at you.

00:45:12.429 --> 00:45:15.429
The daughter of Jerusalem shakes her head at you.

00:45:15.429 --> 00:45:18.429
Whom have you taunted and blasphemed?

00:45:18.429 --> 00:45:21.429
It is against the holy one of Israel.

00:45:21.429 --> 00:45:25.429
Your rage against me and your roaring have reached my ears.

00:45:25.429 --> 00:45:28.429
So I will put my hook in your nose

00:45:28.429 --> 00:45:31.429
and my bridal between your lips

00:45:31.429 --> 00:45:34.429
and I will lead you back the way you came.

00:45:34.429 --> 00:46:37.849
Why are you still sleeping?

00:46:37.849 --> 00:47:24.570
As you command, but he's dead.

00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:32.070
He's dead.

00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:35.070
Not a mark on them.

00:47:35.070 --> 00:47:37.070
I was at my post, my Lord.

00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:39.070
All of the night my king, I swear it.

00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:40.070
I heard nothing.

00:47:40.070 --> 00:47:42.070
I saw nothing.

00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:44.070
What a wasted deal.

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:46.070
My Lord, who could have done this?
