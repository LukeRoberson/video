WEBVTT

00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:10.480
Welcome to an exciting February program of JW Broadcapsing.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.039
Brother Robert Lucioni is joining us today.

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.760
Robert, what can we look forward to?

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.480
Thank you, Brother Heard.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.920
We will get a taste of what it is like to attend an international convention, but also how

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.239
much work goes into preparing for one.

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:32.920
And we will meet a man who is away from the truth for a long time.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.159
But one day, a non-witness reminded him of Jehovah's existence.

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:43.960
Also we will see a very interesting music video about life and the perspective of a public

00:00:43.960 --> 00:01:06.650
witnessing car.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.650
Unity.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.849
It is often so elusive in political, religious, social, racial, and financial circles.

00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:19.730
We love the amazing unity that we experience as a global brotherhood.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.530
No matter the country, one's background or former beliefs, it is amazing that around

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.329
the world we have unity of thought.

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:36.650
Though speaking hundreds of languages, there is one singular sound or unified message that

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.489
is being preached.

00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:46.810
In fact, Romans 10, 17, and 18 says, so faith follows the thing Heard.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.370
In turn, what is heard is through the Word about Christ.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.170
But I ask, they did not fail to hear, did they?

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.129
Why, in fact, into all the earth, their sound went out and to the ends of the inhabited

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:03.810
earth, their message?

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.609
That is amazing.

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:11.409
Millions believe in exactly the same based on the Word about Christ.

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:18.210
One singular sound goes out, that is unity of belief.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.210
Some may say unity of belief, your brainwash.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:29.530
Well, we do agree that our thinking has been washed clean from the complicated doctrines

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.490
that have evolved since Jesus walked the earth.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:40.289
However, the unity of mind results from a thorough study of the Scriptures.

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:45.969
It is a matter of learning God's Word and separating His teachings out from the many

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:50.810
doctrines that have been introduced by human thinking.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:58.490
When a classroom full of students take a math course like algebra, at the end of the class,

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:05.569
no one accuses them of being brainwashed when they all end up united in their understanding,

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.729
they simply learn the math accurately and put it to use.

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:17.169
But it is one thing to be united in thinking and yet another to be united in spirit as

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:19.009
a bread of hood.

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:24.930
Going back to a math class, at the end of the course, all are united in thought.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.889
They learned algebra, but that does not mean they all like each other.

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:37.889
They may have petty rivalry or outright prejudice against some of their classmates.

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:44.210
When we learn the truth from God's Word, we become united, not only in thinking, but also

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.009
in spirit with our brothers around the world.

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:53.849
Even if we had deep-seated prejudice in our hearts before studying with Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.969
it begins to melt away when learning the truth.

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:01.879
Why is that?

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:09.039
You will notice, as we read in Ephesians chapter 4, that godly qualities are learned and

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:10.560
perceived.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.199
The bad traits we might have had before have to be unlearned.

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:22.920
And Jehovah's Holy Spirit helps mold our personality to match more closely the beautiful

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.000
qualities mentioned here in Ephesians 4.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:39.519
The Apostle Paul says, therefore, I, the prisoner in the Lord, appealed to you to walk

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:46.000
worthily of the calling with which you were called, with all humility and myoness and patience

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.439
putting up with one another in life, earnestly endeavoring to maintain the oneness of the

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:54.920
spirit in the anointing bond of peace.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:01.040
One body there is in one spirit, just as you were called to the one hope of your calling,

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:09.399
one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is overall and through

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:13.720
all and in all.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.600
My that is unity, isn't it?

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:23.240
All of those fine quantities reflect the personality of Jesus, perfect.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:30.920
He was unspoiled by the ingrained hatred and prejudices that we may have been exposed

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.920
to.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.199
So is it easy to curb ingrained prejudices?

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:38.199
No.

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:40.720
It is not that easy.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.199
It would be good if it was, but it isn't.

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.120
It is a process.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:53.120
Sometimes we show the right spirit on the outside, but inside we are still struggling

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:58.680
to cultivate that true unity deep in our heart.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:04.480
Do we have a Bible example that makes clear that this is a process that we must work our

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.920
way through?

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.040
Yes, there is one.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.480
In Galatians chapter 2.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:16.399
Here is Seifas, who was usually called Peter, though Jewish by birth had learned from

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:18.800
Jesus not to be partial.

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:23.199
For many years, he has accepted non-Jewish fellow worshippers.

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:24.959
He associated with them.

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:27.399
He ate meals together with them.

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:32.120
But was there still a residue of prejudice within him?

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.920
It seems so.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:39.600
His reactions may have even come as a surprise to Peter himself.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:50.220
Regulation chapter 2 verses 11 through 14.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:58.060
And it says, however, when Seifas came to Antioch, I resisted him face to face, because

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.420
he was clearly in the wrong.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:07.339
For before certain men from James arrived, he used to eat with people of the nations.

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:13.660
But when they arrived, he stopped doing this and separated himself, fearing those of the

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.459
circumcised class.

00:07:16.459 --> 00:07:22.459
The rest of the Jews also joined him in putting on this pretense, so that even Barnabas

00:07:22.459 --> 00:07:26.540
was led along with them in their pretense.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:32.420
But when I saw that they were not walking in step with the truth of the good news, I

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:38.980
said to Seifas, before them all, if you, though you or a Jew, live as the nations do and

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:45.339
not as Jews do, how can you compel people of the nations to live according to Jewish

00:07:45.339 --> 00:07:47.339
practice?

00:07:47.339 --> 00:07:49.459
What happened to Peter?

00:07:49.459 --> 00:07:57.139
Fear man caused his former traits of prejudice to resurface, and it was contagious, affecting

00:07:57.139 --> 00:07:59.379
other Jewish men around him.

00:07:59.379 --> 00:08:05.300
In fact, the verse said, even Barnabas was led along with them.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.579
Barnabas was a very warm, hearted, generous person.

00:08:08.579 --> 00:08:12.300
His name even means son of comfort.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:17.699
If Peter and Barnabas could succumb to this kind of behavior based on their childhood

00:08:17.699 --> 00:08:22.740
training, we need to be very careful.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:28.779
For a period of time, it may take a conscious effort on our part to maintain unity with

00:08:28.779 --> 00:08:34.059
our brothers and sisters of varying cultures or races.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:43.059
Was Peter able to fully eradicate any residual form of prejudice from his being?

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:45.259
It seems he was.

00:08:45.259 --> 00:08:48.860
Turn now to 1 Peter chapter 1.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:55.419
About 10 years after he shunned the non-Jewish Christians, Peter was inspired to write these

00:08:55.419 --> 00:09:01.720
words, verse 22.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:07.440
Now that you have purified yourselves by your obedience to the truth with unhypocritical

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:15.840
brotherly affection as the result, love one another intensely from the heart.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:21.399
Learning what is right and then consistently doing what is right is a process.

00:09:21.399 --> 00:09:23.600
We learn the truth gradually.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.679
We soon have unity of mind and thinking.

00:09:27.679 --> 00:09:32.799
However in time we purify ourselves, how?

00:09:32.799 --> 00:09:37.200
The verse said by our obedience to the truth.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:45.320
And did you notice Peter says with unhypocritical brotherly affection, not the way he acted

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.919
ten years or so earlier.

00:09:47.919 --> 00:09:55.399
He even said to love one another intensely from the heart, deep inside.

00:09:55.399 --> 00:10:02.360
We would have love for all in our brotherhood without even a twinge of prejudice.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.240
Please turn back to Ephesians chapter 4.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.559
How does this process of changing work?

00:10:08.559 --> 00:10:15.820
Look at verse 17.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:22.980
So this is what I say and bear witness to in the Lord that you should no longer go on

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:29.940
walking just as the nations also walk in the futility of their minds.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:37.659
It makes clear that we need to change our thinking, our minds, and what follows this unity

00:10:37.659 --> 00:10:43.460
of thinking, verses 22 through 24.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:48.820
You were taught to put away the old personality that conforms to your former course of conduct

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:54.659
and that is being corrupted according to the deceptive, its deceptive desires.

00:10:54.659 --> 00:11:01.139
And you should continue to be made new in your dominant mental attitude and should put

00:11:01.139 --> 00:11:09.860
on the new personality that was created according to God's will in true righteousness and loyalty.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:17.500
Our very personality changes because of our new dominant mental attitude.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:24.580
The beautiful thing is that this process is at work in millions of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.820
worldwide.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:35.860
And even though some of us may still be working on this kind of unity, deep inside, this

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:44.580
love already shows on the outside as we mingle with our brothers from all over the world.

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:54.500
On 133, verse 1 says, it write, how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell

00:11:54.500 --> 00:12:00.669
together in unity.

00:12:00.669 --> 00:12:08.190
But the spirit of unity in our organization is manifested in many ways.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:12.669
Robert, I know you have a good example of unity among God's people.

00:12:12.669 --> 00:12:15.190
Yes, Brother Heard.

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:21.110
Once we come from a variety of different backgrounds, the organization is making a great effort

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:25.190
to provide spiritual food and as many languages as possible.

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:30.909
So that in spite of our differences, we can all be one united family.

00:12:30.909 --> 00:12:36.830
Our brothers and sisters, as speak Navajo, a Native American language, experience that

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:40.909
unity, especially in October of last year.

00:12:40.909 --> 00:12:53.370
That was the first time an assembly was held in their mother tongue.

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:57.409
The Navajo Nation is the largest reservation in the U.S.

00:12:57.409 --> 00:13:00.809
It's made up of 27,000 square miles.

00:13:00.809 --> 00:13:05.289
The reservation itself is bigger than 10 of the states in the U.S.

00:13:05.289 --> 00:13:10.809
And also there's almost 300,000 members of the Navajo tribe.

00:13:10.809 --> 00:13:15.610
When it comes to the language and the reservation, some people think that the language is a dying

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:18.730
language and that nobody speaks their native tongue anymore.

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:25.409
But really that's a myth because Navajo is spoken by everyone, young and old alike.

00:13:25.409 --> 00:13:28.840
In fact, they teach it in school.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:33.279
The Navajo people are very receptive to learning the truth.

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:35.759
We could see though that there's something missing.

00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:37.840
We had excellent teaching in our meetings.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.600
We had wonderful pioneers, need graders that moved out, work in the area.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.759
That something was missing.

00:13:44.759 --> 00:13:50.799
And it took us a while to realize we needed to talk to people in their language.

00:13:50.799 --> 00:13:55.519
We automatically assume, because they speak English, we can talk to them about how are you

00:13:55.519 --> 00:14:00.919
doing their day-to-day life, that they're getting everything, but they're not.

00:14:00.919 --> 00:14:05.600
When we started using Navajo in the meetings and using our Navajo Bible and choking it

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.840
out, like we can't even do it well, it had more impact on the friends and the most eloquent

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.399
English talks we could give.

00:14:13.399 --> 00:14:17.440
To acknowledge, the first Navajo baptize was in the 1950s.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.440
It was a sister.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:26.080
It wasn't until the 90s where more effort was put forth to bring in more of the witnesses

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.879
and to the reservation.

00:14:27.879 --> 00:14:34.539
In 2011, the governing body gave directions to establish a remote translation office in

00:14:34.539 --> 00:14:36.100
Chintley, Arizona.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:41.179
In March 2013, the first Navajo congregation was established.

00:14:41.179 --> 00:14:48.500
And from that point on, we've now have three additional congregations that have been formed.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.779
And we have seven groups.

00:14:50.779 --> 00:14:57.460
The last few years, we've assigned a number of special pioneers, their 12 other now,

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:03.980
and two missionaries to the reservation to spread the good news to the Navajo people.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:10.460
And they were directed to learn the language.

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:15.340
Usually my wife and I get up early and we'll either listen to the Navajo Bible or we'll

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:20.100
listen to a brochure on JW.org in the Navajo language.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:25.700
And that really gets us prepared for speaking the language and reading the language to our

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:26.700
neighbors.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:32.740
In our congregation, we have 48 Bible studies and 150% meeting attendance.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:37.580
With many Bible students attending meetings on a regular basis, they're going to assemblies

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.500
and conventions.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:43.179
Currently we're helping a family of eight learn more about the Bible and they're progressing

00:15:43.179 --> 00:15:44.179
well.

00:15:44.179 --> 00:15:48.620
One of the relatives told them, you're losing your culture and you're learning a white

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.620
man's religion.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:55.139
And the young daughter spoke up and said, we're not losing our culture.

00:15:55.139 --> 00:15:59.740
At the meetings, we're learning to write, read, and speak Navajo.

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:03.419
And we use the Navajo Bible at all of our meetings and we love it.

00:16:03.419 --> 00:16:08.179
And so what a joy it is to help people to make changes in their lives and they have a

00:16:08.179 --> 00:16:36.230
happier, a fuller life because of what they're learning.

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:42.509
October 25th, 2014 was a very special day, one that'll long be remembered because it

00:16:42.509 --> 00:16:50.429
was the first time Jehovah's Witnesses had an assembly all in the Navajo language to

00:16:50.429 --> 00:16:53.789
see the great increases taking place.

00:16:53.789 --> 00:16:59.350
And then to be at that special occasion, when they all came together at one time, it was

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:01.629
just somewhat overwhelming.

00:17:01.629 --> 00:17:05.670
I was smiling dear to year the whole time.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:10.950
When I got on the stage, I had to be very careful because it was such an emotional time

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:12.230
for me.

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:17.630
And to see the old ones that had struggled for years and years to help the work get off

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:22.789
the ground and the Navajo field was very, very touching and heartwarming.

00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:28.750
It really is an experience I will never forget in my life.

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:33.630
And so many different tribes also came that spoke their native tongues.

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:40.710
In fact, we had 26 total Native American tribes and they came from three countries, Canada,

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:42.990
US, and Mexico.

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:44.430
And many of them drove hours.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:50.869
We heard of one group that drove 22 hours in order to attend this special occasion.

00:17:50.869 --> 00:17:55.549
Being here with the brothers and just an interchange of encouragement makes it really special

00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:56.549
for me.

00:17:56.549 --> 00:18:01.990
It's so encouraging to be with other people that are learning or know Navajo and see them

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:03.549
get to know Jehovah more.

00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:08.990
I almost cried when I heard the first talk, when it was over, it was just beautiful.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:10.470
It's wonderful.

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:15.710
You get to see what Jehovah's Holy Spirit, when it directs you in the right place, what

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:17.430
it can accomplish.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.950
All I could say to Jehovah is thank you, Jehovah, for letting me be here.

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:27.630
I feel so happy how much Jehovah has taken an interest in all his people, but today

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:28.630
the native people.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:50.190
This is the first time these Navajo brothers and sisters were able to hear the entire

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:56.029
program in their own language and to hear the Bible read in their language.

00:18:56.029 --> 00:19:01.470
They've struggled for many years in the reservation and just off the reservation because they

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:08.670
had to attend English meetings and they did wonderful Jehovah bless their beautiful efforts

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:12.910
and at this assembly, it was a paraded touch their hearts.

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:20.829
But the first time ever in my life, I didn't have to translate from English and to be able

00:19:20.829 --> 00:19:24.630
to hear it and go straight here.

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:27.430
It doesn't stop here and goes here.

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:35.509
I think the most exciting to me was looking at Psalm 684, Bohemini, Jehovah, yeah, think

00:19:35.509 --> 00:19:36.509
about that name.

00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:39.950
It's amazing, you know, who the creator is.

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:49.509
The joy that I feel because Jehovah is like talking to me in Navajo and it hits here.

00:19:49.509 --> 00:19:56.710
I appreciate our Navajo friends so much because they stuck with Jehovah all that time even

00:19:56.710 --> 00:20:02.670
though they weren't understanding everything to form a love for Jehovah without a full understanding.

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:04.069
That's an amazing thing.

00:20:04.069 --> 00:20:09.789
Our Navajo friends have been building a strong faith on crumbs and now they're getting

00:20:09.789 --> 00:20:11.710
fed spiritually.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:16.269
The good news brochure, the Jehovah's Wheel brochure, this is the richest spiritual food

00:20:16.269 --> 00:20:18.869
the Navajo friends have ever had in their life.

00:20:18.869 --> 00:20:22.789
They've sat through every watchtower study, but they're hearing something in their language

00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:24.109
that's touching them.

00:20:24.109 --> 00:20:32.829
I always imagined a new system, entered A, I saw it, and so it's really special, very special.

00:20:32.829 --> 00:20:38.710
I see this as a small step and Jehovah's organization soon, we're going to all learn one

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:41.789
language and that language is left.

00:20:41.789 --> 00:20:46.069
I feel like Jehovah reads out and hugged the Navajo people.

00:20:46.069 --> 00:20:51.309
That's what it was like, like he embraced them and said, I love you.

00:20:51.309 --> 00:20:56.670
We pray Jehovah's continued blessing upon all the effort that's being put into preaching

00:20:56.670 --> 00:21:14.599
the good news to people and all nations, tribes and tongues, including the Navajo feel.

00:21:14.599 --> 00:21:19.119
We are so happy for our brothers and sisters in the Navajo feel.

00:21:19.119 --> 00:21:26.039
It is evident that Jehovah bless their assembly and isn't it true that assemblies and conventions

00:21:26.039 --> 00:21:28.799
strengthen all of us as a people.

00:21:28.799 --> 00:21:33.240
Last year, international conventions were arranged all over the world.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:38.160
And if you had the opportunity to attend one, I am sure you noticed the emphasis that was

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:42.519
put on showing hospitality to the foreign delegates.

00:21:42.519 --> 00:21:47.920
Our team visited some of the international conventions and we could tell the local brothers

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:56.970
and sisters had worked very hard to make everyone feel welcome.

00:21:56.970 --> 00:22:00.130
We have 2500 delegates coming in for us.

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:02.329
We want to give them our absolute best.

00:22:02.329 --> 00:22:05.609
What we want them to feel is the love of the true brotherhood.

00:22:05.609 --> 00:22:09.730
The commission was to make it a life-changing experience in order to do that.

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:14.809
We thought we had to put together more than just come and have some dinner with us.

00:22:14.809 --> 00:22:15.809
Overwhelming.

00:22:15.809 --> 00:22:17.490
I don't know how to express how I feel.

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:21.289
We had, first of all, come up and create the acts.

00:22:21.289 --> 00:22:25.690
So I went in the room for two days, cried and prayed.

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:31.529
But this is where the trust that Johova is directing this through his organization has

00:22:31.529 --> 00:22:32.890
helped us.

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:37.569
There was so much more involved in showing hospitality to our delegates than we originally

00:22:37.569 --> 00:22:38.569
thought.

00:22:38.569 --> 00:22:45.089
We have an original authentic 1892 Chuck Wagon, real Texas Cowboys, real horse trainers,

00:22:45.089 --> 00:22:47.890
open lessons and Texas long horns.

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:52.170
We're making buttermilk biscuits just like they did on the trail in a Dutch oven and

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:53.970
colds.

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:58.970
And we have four different casts that we're using, each somewhere in the range of 80, 90 per

00:22:58.970 --> 00:22:59.970
cast.

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:02.089
Three different locations we're going to be performing at.

00:23:02.089 --> 00:23:05.930
The spans over four days.

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:10.970
The evening programs include providing some food to the friends that are here, some spiritual

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:13.970
entertainment with music, some interviews, some videos.

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:17.930
We haven't had field service part of our conventions as in the past.

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:21.329
However, it's so apparent to Johova's behind us.

00:23:21.329 --> 00:23:26.690
The example set by the slave, it's so evident this should be done.

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:31.730
They're facing similar challenges in the ministry, but they're still working hard while dealing

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:37.289
with the challenges, hearing that was very encouraging and it gave me the renewed motivation

00:23:37.289 --> 00:23:39.289
to keep preaching with zeal.

00:23:39.289 --> 00:23:43.329
We also need to volunteer to come to the assembly hall and greet the delegates as they came

00:23:43.329 --> 00:23:44.329
in off the buses.

00:23:44.329 --> 00:23:49.809
At first I wasn't sure why there were many people outside when I saw them from the bus.

00:23:49.809 --> 00:23:54.250
When I found out that they were there to welcome us, it put me to tears.

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:57.490
When we found out that the tours were coming to the assembly hall, we knew that we were

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:00.009
going to have an extra special blessing.

00:24:00.009 --> 00:24:05.130
We had well over 3,600 volunteers and probably more like 5,000 that were willing to help.

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:10.569
We contacted a little bit over 200 congregations to participate in these activities.

00:24:11.089 --> 00:24:14.769
We're from Cheyenne, Wyoming, about 850 miles away.

00:24:14.769 --> 00:24:19.450
We started them out two or three weeks ago, getting all the wagons ready, and it took

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:23.289
a couple of days to get here.

00:24:23.289 --> 00:24:29.930
One of the things I had to do was ask permission on my job, as for a week off in order to be here.

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:36.609
I prayed a lot to Johova and through him they gave me permission and I was able to be here.

00:24:36.609 --> 00:24:42.690
I'm so energized and pumped and I really just see us walking into the new world and feeling

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:44.609
all of this every day.

00:24:44.609 --> 00:24:50.849
My job has been to come up with drawings and paintings of note cards of things that are

00:24:50.849 --> 00:24:54.049
indigenous to Washington.

00:24:54.049 --> 00:24:59.690
I had the privilege of designing the logo that went on to give back for the International

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:00.690
Prevention.

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:03.690
We're going to sing for the demi-gates.

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:09.369
I'm singing for the dedicons because I want to make God happy in the dedicons too.

00:25:09.369 --> 00:25:11.930
The singing at the airport is what's touching.

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:18.089
To see them waiting for us, it rides at the night because we arrive around 10 pm.

00:25:18.089 --> 00:25:22.609
I think that they'll be happy to see all of us welcoming them, the things that we're

00:25:22.609 --> 00:25:27.289
preparing for them, something to take back with them to remember this opportunity that

00:25:27.289 --> 00:25:28.289
they had.

00:25:28.289 --> 00:25:34.930
This part, the top part, the large J.W. was actually from the messenger, which was back

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:40.210
in 1931, the International Convention in Columbus, Ohio.

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:45.369
As you see with all the brothers and sisters, everyone wanting to contribute, everyone

00:25:45.369 --> 00:25:50.170
wanting to have a part, everyone wanting to be cold, everyone wanting to participate

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:52.369
in whatever way they can.

00:25:52.369 --> 00:25:54.009
Welcome to Seattle.

00:25:54.009 --> 00:25:58.490
We're just seeing it being used and enjoyed by the dedicons.

00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:59.490
It was a great feeling.

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:05.009
It was a little bit tired from the flight, but when you saw the smiles and the cheers and

00:26:05.009 --> 00:26:09.410
the big banners and all the gifts, it was just like, oh my goodness.

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:10.410
You felt it.

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:11.410
You felt it.

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:12.410
You felt it left straight away.

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:13.410
It was just love.

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:14.410
We don't know where they're from.

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:19.130
We don't know their names, but they just smile and wave and seeing that unity.

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:23.049
I mean, it's genuine love and you almost want to just cry.

00:26:23.049 --> 00:26:28.410
You want them to know that they have brothers here that will support them, who love them,

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:32.250
and are willing to do whatever we can to make them enjoy their stay here.

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:33.250
Yes.

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:37.289
We just want them to feel like our arms have been around them the whole time they've

00:26:37.289 --> 00:26:38.289
been here.

00:26:38.289 --> 00:26:42.569
It really shows that your hope is behind the work, but it also shows the loving brotherhood,

00:26:42.569 --> 00:26:48.529
because it's so evident by what you see with all the happy faces, the zeal, the enthusiasm,

00:26:48.529 --> 00:26:53.009
everything that is being spent is all so that we can praise your hope, but also to welcome

00:26:53.009 --> 00:26:57.170
his sheep, the delegates coming from all the different parts of the world.

00:26:57.170 --> 00:27:00.809
I hope, two, three thousand years from now, somebody walks up to me and goes, I remember

00:27:00.809 --> 00:27:01.809
you.

00:27:01.809 --> 00:27:03.769
You were at the cowboy deal in Texas.

00:27:03.769 --> 00:27:05.170
That to me would be fantastic.

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:09.849
I know cowboys aren't supposed to cry, but trust us, we do what it comes to this.

00:27:09.849 --> 00:27:11.730
I'm so happy.

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:13.250
It moves me to tears.

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:18.809
They came here to let us sing and they watched us, so they would take our song with them.

00:27:18.809 --> 00:27:21.650
We wanted delegates to be happy.

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:31.990
I am confident all the delegates were very happy and doesn't make us happy to see how much

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:37.430
time and effort our brothers and sisters devoted to welcoming the visitors.

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:42.750
But before thousands of delegates can be invited to a large convention, there is a significant

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:45.710
amount of work that needs to take place.

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:52.400
We joined some of the volunteers behind the scenes.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:56.880
About a year and a half ago the branch called and invited me to help out with the International

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.880
Conventions.

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:02.720
February of 2013, we were invited to work in Rooming and it was confidential.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.720
We couldn't even tell our wives what we were doing.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:08.960
Came from North Little Rock, Arkansas, where it was a Buckingham, Pennsylvania, the assembly hall

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.440
here, to construct these stages.

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:14.359
We're going to go to each of the conventions and assist the brothers to put these together

00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:15.799
on the fields there.

00:28:15.799 --> 00:28:17.480
I serve on the hospitality committee.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.039
I've been involved in this project for over a year now.

00:28:20.039 --> 00:28:25.039
An event of this size takes a lot of organization.

00:28:25.039 --> 00:28:30.200
And we haven't had a convention in Seattle really for decades.

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:36.640
So it meant educating the friends so that they are enthused as we are to support the effort.

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:41.440
When we all first got the assignment, we didn't know what we had in front of us, which might

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:44.960
have been a blessing at the time, but we knew that Jehovah would step in.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.440
Our whole life revolves around theocratic service.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:51.079
We always look for the opportunities to serve Jehovah and our brothers, no matter what

00:28:51.079 --> 00:28:52.079
it is really.

00:28:52.079 --> 00:28:54.079
It was a bit overwhelming, to say the least.

00:28:54.079 --> 00:28:57.960
The initial request was to have 500 people here every single day.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.240
All the cargations were given questionnaires, the friends to fill out.

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:04.960
We had over 3,000 individuals from the Seattle area fill those out.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.640
You know, we pray to Jehovah to always be used.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:12.400
We have a willing spirit and we want to be used in any capacity that we can.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:18.279
And to be asked to be here, to take part in this is a great privilege.

00:29:18.279 --> 00:29:21.000
Why did I want to be part of this?

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.559
Well, the question to me should be why not be part of it.

00:29:24.559 --> 00:29:28.640
I mean, it's exciting, it's for Jehovah, he's people.

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:32.079
So there is no way I would have let that pass.

00:29:32.079 --> 00:29:37.720
What I do, I serve Jehovah and anything Jehovah asks, we try to do.

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:41.839
Out of the group that we've asked to assist and all these different trades, there's quite

00:29:41.839 --> 00:29:47.000
a few trades represented, none of them said they were unavailable or could not make room

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
for it.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.440
So the volunteer spirit here has been just incredible.

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:55.079
The letter we sent out that described the activities, let them clearly know that all

00:29:55.079 --> 00:29:57.960
they be doing is coming here, greeting the friends and leaving.

00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:01.319
They be here maybe an hour and that didn't deter a single person.

00:30:01.319 --> 00:30:09.000
I enjoy volunteering because it allows me an opportunity to show my appreciation to the

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:16.160
organization, to Jehovah, it gives me opportunities to demonstrate my love for the brotherhood.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:22.039
I do this professionally for my business and so I just decided to make it a priority

00:30:22.039 --> 00:30:24.200
and this Jehovah was my top client.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:30.200
I really wanted the opportunity to come and sing for people that came from Portugal and

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:34.279
Spain to make them happy.

00:30:34.279 --> 00:30:37.240
Many times I thought, I just don't know how this is going to work.

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:41.920
We didn't know whether we would have enough, even for one cast for one evening program

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:50.799
and we had 14 to put on and for cast we need to get each cast over 100 acts.

00:30:50.799 --> 00:30:53.759
Every couple of months we would have a video conference with the branch which is really

00:30:53.759 --> 00:30:56.160
nice to see those brothers face to face, get to know them.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:00.960
The assignment of this magnitude can be physically draining because you're busy or worried.

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:04.880
They took the time to give us some of their time, their attention to provide us with the

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.480
direction that we needed.

00:31:06.519 --> 00:31:10.440
We would often times ask a lot of questions, they didn't have the answers which made us

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:15.559
feel better because they had to go to maybe their oversight, to the teaching committee,

00:31:15.559 --> 00:31:18.079
to the branch committee to find some of the answers.

00:31:18.079 --> 00:31:21.960
So we all felt we were kind of in it together, trying to make this work together.

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:27.519
In those times of discouragement, it never failed that an email would show up or a card

00:31:27.519 --> 00:31:32.500
thanking myself and my family for what we're doing and the other brothers and always an

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:35.880
expression of their thoughts and prayers on our behalf.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.160
Only that just energize you, you're ready to go again.

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:41.599
The friends responded admirably, it was amazing.

00:31:41.599 --> 00:31:44.839
The first day we had 500, we hit that that quota.

00:31:44.839 --> 00:31:48.720
So it was great to see the entire parking lot full with smiling faces and signs and people

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.400
screaming and yelling for the delegates.

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.480
It was a wonderful site.

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.480
It's completely Jehovah's Hand, it's pretty cool.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.839
I am serving as one of the 800 volunteers here.

00:31:57.839 --> 00:32:00.000
I'm serving as a waitress.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:07.680
I came here today to welcome my brothers and sisters from Russia, from just all different

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.000
parts of the world.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.720
I don't know them, but I know I love them.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:15.119
They're my brothers and I tell you what, when I went to their countries as a kid, they

00:32:15.119 --> 00:32:21.819
showed me the same love and so I'm happy to give it back to them.

00:32:21.819 --> 00:32:28.720
We've spent a lot of hours in this, I know myself, I've spent 180 in March and I'm about

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:33.000
120 this month, but still getting out in the ministry.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:40.680
There was one brother who asked my age, he was from Japan and he said his mother had died.

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:46.400
He said you will be my mother and that was just so dear to me and I just hugged him and

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:47.680
we hugged each other.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:55.160
Friends are excited, they're willing to volunteer, they're donating their time, the resources,

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.160
everything.

00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:01.240
The benefit is it invigorates some spiritually and it invigorates them to do more in Jehovah's

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.240
Service.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:06.480
Even though we were behind the scenes in doing the work and though some I think it's a

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:11.480
thankless job, just knowing that we did all for Jehovah and our brothers and how they

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.839
were able to enjoy it makes it whole worth it.

00:33:13.839 --> 00:33:22.160
Volunteering to be a greeter has really strengthened my faith as one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:25.359
We're doing this for our brothers and sisters but I think we're getting way more out of it

00:33:25.359 --> 00:33:27.839
than we feel like they're going to get.

00:33:27.839 --> 00:33:29.680
100% I would do it again.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:34.119
Without a doubt, if we were asked tomorrow to start another project on this stuff, we

00:33:34.119 --> 00:33:35.559
would start at no problem.

00:33:35.559 --> 00:33:40.420
It makes that it's been a life-changing experience.

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:46.220
I just enjoyed it, thank you.

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:51.539
Have you ever asked yourself what is really the difference between an international convention

00:33:51.539 --> 00:33:53.700
and a special convention?

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:56.339
Are they both the same but just with a different name?

00:33:56.339 --> 00:33:57.339
No.

00:33:57.339 --> 00:34:00.619
There are actually some fundamental differences.

00:34:00.619 --> 00:34:07.099
The international conventions are usually scheduled every four or five years where a special

00:34:07.099 --> 00:34:13.260
conventions are held yearly as long as no international convention is scheduled.

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:19.860
Also international conventions are generally held in large venues with a minimum of 20,000

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:21.739
attendees.

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:26.820
Special conventions are often held in smaller size venues, usually including fewer than

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:33.619
12,000 on-site attendees, although additional sites may be tied in as well.

00:34:33.619 --> 00:34:38.179
There is a difference in the number of foreign delegates as well.

00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:43.139
Twice as many foreign delegates are invited to attend international conventions as compared

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:45.539
to special conventions.

00:34:45.539 --> 00:34:50.460
An international conventions also provide an opportunity for the branch to invite those

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:55.940
in foreign service, including our missionaries, to return home for a visit.

00:34:55.940 --> 00:35:01.579
Using funds contributed by the Worldwide Brotherhood.

00:35:01.579 --> 00:35:08.019
One joyous aspect of conventions is meeting our brothers and sisters from around the world,

00:35:08.019 --> 00:35:12.579
but the reason we can enjoy that so much is because of what brother heard spoke to us

00:35:12.579 --> 00:35:19.300
about, unity, unity from the heart that melts away prejudice.

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:24.500
In this morning's Worship program from Bethel, brother David Splein highlighted some Bible

00:35:24.579 --> 00:35:30.380
principles that can help us to maintain our unity.

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:35.739
We can say that the theme of the Book of Romans is really about unity.

00:35:35.739 --> 00:35:41.940
It's a marvelous example of how to break down barriers, how to break down prejudice.

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:48.500
Now you'll recall that there was bad blood in the Christian congregation between the Jews

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:50.340
and the Romans.

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:54.860
Some of the Jews thought they were better than anyone else because of circumcision and

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:57.699
because of their religious background.

00:35:57.699 --> 00:36:01.659
And Paul doesn't just say to the Jews and the Romans, well, you know you're all equal

00:36:01.659 --> 00:36:03.619
in God's sight.

00:36:03.619 --> 00:36:05.619
He goes further.

00:36:05.619 --> 00:36:08.539
And his argument is masterful.

00:36:08.539 --> 00:36:17.739
Let's turn to Romans 2, 28 and 29, and see how Paul handles this very thorny problem.

00:36:17.739 --> 00:36:29.900
Verse chapter 2, verses 28 and 29, for he is not a Jew who is one on the outside, nor

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:35.980
is circumcision something on the outside on the flesh, but he is a Jew who is one on the

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:44.539
inside, and his circumcision is that of the heart by spirit and not by a written code.

00:36:44.539 --> 00:36:49.860
That person's praise comes from God, not from people.

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:52.739
Now what's Paul's argument?

00:36:52.739 --> 00:36:58.820
Paul is saying you're all of the anointed, so you are all Jews.

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:06.300
You are all spiritual Israelites, and what's more, you are all circumcised.

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:12.300
And that includes you sisters, he says, because you're of the anointed and you have been

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:16.820
circumcised in the heart by Holy Spirit.

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:21.900
So then that gives a weight to what Paul had written to the Galatians when he said there

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:28.059
is neither male nor female, there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor

00:37:28.059 --> 00:37:29.139
Friedman.

00:37:29.139 --> 00:37:35.739
So he is completely breaking down the barriers by saying you are all one in Jesus Christ.

00:37:35.739 --> 00:37:40.940
Now some of the verses that we love to quote in the book of Romans actually promote the

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:46.500
idea of unity, the fact that there is no distinction between one race and another.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:54.940
For example, Romans 3.23 all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.

00:37:54.940 --> 00:38:02.619
Romans 5.12 through one man, our common ancestor Adam, sin, anointed of the world, and death

00:38:02.619 --> 00:38:04.019
through sin.

00:38:04.019 --> 00:38:09.420
Well, why was Paul so insistent on the need for unity?

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:15.219
Perhaps he didn't know at the time, but Jehovah knew.

00:38:15.219 --> 00:38:18.300
Paul wrote his letter in 56 CE.

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:22.599
Now what was the situation in Rome at the time?

00:38:22.599 --> 00:38:28.420
The emperor Claudius, the one who had expelled all the Jews from Rome, had died, and a new

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:34.579
emperor, a very promising one, had taken the throne.

00:38:34.579 --> 00:38:35.900
Nero.

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:42.699
Now it may seem strange to say that Nero was a very promising emperor, but historians

00:38:42.699 --> 00:38:48.420
tell us that during the first five years of his reign, Nero was a very good emperor.

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:54.940
In fact, the Roman historian, contemporary historian, Gaeus Sutonius, had this to say,

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:59.860
Nero started off with a parade of virtue.

00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:04.900
He never missed an opportunity of being generous or merciful.

00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:09.820
If he could not abolish some of the heavier taxes, he lowered them.

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:13.420
They have asked to sign a death warrant for a convicted felon.

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:19.099
He would sigh, ah, how I wish I had never learned to write.

00:39:19.099 --> 00:39:26.940
Once when the senate passed a vote of thanks to him, he answered, wait until I deserve them.

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:31.780
And the fact is that Nero was popular with the poor right up to his death.

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:36.760
Now, incidentally, it would have been during that five-year period that the Apostle Paul

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:42.940
told Philemon that he was optimistic of being released when he appeared before Nero.

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:46.739
It appears that Paul thought that Nero would have been fair.

00:39:46.739 --> 00:39:49.139
And Nero did have a background in law.

00:39:49.139 --> 00:39:55.820
Nero had actually fought cases, argued cases before the courts in his youth.

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:59.530
So what's the point?

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:05.550
Although in private, Nero was debonged in public, he was very good, he was a solid emperor,

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:09.469
and the Christians may have thought that they were going to enter into a period of peace.

00:40:09.469 --> 00:40:10.989
Here is a man who was fair.

00:40:10.989 --> 00:40:12.349
Here is a man who was just.

00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:15.949
Here is a man who doesn't like putting people to death.

00:40:15.949 --> 00:40:19.190
What a mistake that would have been.

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:25.429
Now in his letter, Paul sends greetings to more than 26 men and women in Rome.

00:40:25.429 --> 00:40:38.030
And in one way, it makes us sad to read the list, Mary, Andronicus, Tunis, Urbinaus,

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:40.030
Rufus.

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:46.469
Knowing as we do that eight years later, many of them would be dead, mulled to death by

00:40:46.469 --> 00:40:51.309
wild dogs or burned alive in Nero's gardens.

00:40:51.309 --> 00:40:58.469
Here makes Paul's words recorded at Romans 817 almost chilling to read, where Paul says

00:40:58.469 --> 00:41:06.110
provided that we suffer together so that we may be glorified together.

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:10.469
Those Christians in Rome were going to suffer together.

00:41:10.469 --> 00:41:15.710
And Paul, right along with them in Rome, about a year after the rest of them, and wouldn't

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:21.989
have been a pity if those Christians were united only in death but never in life.

00:41:21.989 --> 00:41:27.190
They needed to learn to love one another so that when faced with death, someone didn't

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:34.030
say, I really don't know if this is the truth because there's a lack of love in the congregation.

00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:37.829
Well who have applied Paul's counsel today?

00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:40.190
The Catholic Church?

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:47.550
Being World War II, in the city of Rome, there were Jews, and there were Romans.

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:51.030
How did the Romans treat the Jews?

00:41:51.030 --> 00:42:00.869
The Vatican and Pius, Italian Catholics, looked silently by, while 7,500 Jews were hauled

00:42:00.869 --> 00:42:04.630
off to the concentration camps in Auschwitz.

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:09.630
They never said a word, and few returned alive.

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:15.469
Now what a contrast with Jehovah's people who have risked their lives on behalf of fellow

00:42:15.469 --> 00:42:20.869
believers in many countries, no matter what their race, no matter what their nationality,

00:42:20.869 --> 00:42:29.110
doesn't make you feel good to belong to an organization where there truly are no foreigners.

00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:34.750
So it is important for us to focus on our unity in the Christian congregation.

00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:40.710
It is impossible for us to succeed if we do not have unity at home.

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:46.510
What can we do to make our home a safe and peaceful haven?

00:42:46.510 --> 00:43:03.300
Just look at some steps that can help us in the right direction.

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:26.139
Anger, hurtful words, devastating effects.

00:43:26.139 --> 00:43:38.940
The Bible says, a mild answer turns away rage, but a harsh word stirs up anger.

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:48.429
The way out of a crisis is only found by learning to speak openly with one another.

00:43:48.429 --> 00:44:01.199
In a mild, gentle way, it takes time and patience.

00:44:01.199 --> 00:44:09.239
Honestly apologizing also helps to build bridges.

00:44:09.239 --> 00:44:16.840
The insight of a man certainly slows down his anger says the Bible.

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:25.559
Insight means understanding, to have empathy for my partner.

00:44:25.559 --> 00:44:30.679
How can I understand the feelings behind their reaction?

00:44:30.679 --> 00:44:34.920
How were my words understood?

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:43.150
Speaking so as not to hurt one another's feelings will help.

00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:50.449
When was everything okay between us?

00:44:50.449 --> 00:44:55.960
What were the things that made us happy?

00:44:55.960 --> 00:45:07.269
Can we revive this love again?

00:45:07.269 --> 00:45:36.619
New direction?

00:45:36.619 --> 00:45:41.940
Brother Forrest James from the State of Oregon in the United States was raised believing

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:45.340
in traditional Native American beliefs.

00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:51.139
He later became one of Jehovah's Witnesses, but left the truth immediately thereafter.

00:45:51.139 --> 00:45:58.099
What helped him regain his relationship with Jehovah after being an actor for 16 years?

00:45:58.099 --> 00:46:04.010
Our team visited him to find out.

00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:16.480
I was raised on the Tullawai Indian Reservation, and I was baptized when I was 12 years old.

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:25.960
Although I was baptized at a young age, those that were around me, doing the exact opposite

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:27.360
of what I was taught.

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:33.219
But what I heard, what I saw, you know, was not, didn't match up.

00:46:33.219 --> 00:46:52.119
Their actions, well, that destroyed my world, destroyed everything, destroyed my family,

00:46:52.119 --> 00:46:56.559
and in time I grew very prejudiced against all the organized religion, Jehovah's Witnesses

00:46:56.559 --> 00:46:57.559
included.

00:46:57.559 --> 00:47:05.920
I was adopted by the film and entertainment industry as a teenager.

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:11.559
I would say to myself with each movie or billboard, that if I could just get this next

00:47:11.559 --> 00:47:14.159
one, I would be satisfied.

00:47:14.159 --> 00:47:17.519
And that's when I became an alcoholic.

00:47:17.519 --> 00:47:20.280
Later on I'd a prayer ceremony with a medicine man.

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:25.599
He said to Jehovah, I approached him about it afterwards, but indignantly, and said,

00:47:25.599 --> 00:47:28.719
yeah, we don't believe in the Bible, it's got nothing to offer.

00:47:28.719 --> 00:47:32.039
And he said, well, how do you know?

00:47:32.039 --> 00:47:37.159
Have you read it?

00:47:37.159 --> 00:47:42.199
My brother invited me to a Bible study, and before I went in, I'd said a prayer and

00:47:42.199 --> 00:47:46.280
was in tears, asking that I not judge these people.

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:50.880
Because at this point, I believed the United Nations would solve mankind's problems.

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:55.360
Incidentally, the meeting that night was based on 2 Corinthians 1114, which points out

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:59.679
that Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.

00:47:59.679 --> 00:48:04.239
In that one hour, deeply interesting things were over time.

00:48:04.239 --> 00:48:09.639
So for the first time in 15 years I decided to attend a convention, and it was actually

00:48:09.639 --> 00:48:14.840
my former tribal chief who became a witness that gave me a ride.

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:18.840
One of my biggest concerns was that I would have to completely give up my culture to serve

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:19.840
Jehovah.

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:27.760
And on the right there, he helped me to see that I didn't have to.

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:32.119
After studying with six different elders, I realized that it's not one person that

00:48:32.119 --> 00:48:37.239
changes everybody, but everybody that changes one person.

00:48:37.239 --> 00:48:40.719
Now there are so many blessings.

00:48:40.719 --> 00:48:42.920
I'm no longer prejudiced.

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:45.880
I have a loving wife.

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:55.400
I get to teach my kids about Jehovah, enjoy a building of association, and I love the

00:48:55.400 --> 00:49:01.800
full-time ministry, especially the opportunity to share with other natives what I was so

00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:02.800
freely given.

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:14.559
I wouldn't trade the life that Jehovah has given me for anything.

00:49:14.559 --> 00:49:19.960
Brother James is now in his third year of pioneering and was recently appointed as a ministerial

00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:22.400
servant in his congregation.

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:28.880
It isn't true that there are no circumstances too complicated for Jehovah to help us.

00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:34.440
Why, in Brother James' case, it was a non-witness medicine man that reminded him of Jehovah's

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:36.440
existence.

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:42.599
But think back for a moment on how Jehovah supported his organization in ancient times.

00:49:42.599 --> 00:49:45.079
One example is Bezalow.

00:49:45.079 --> 00:49:46.880
Do you remember him?

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:50.840
Jehovah appointed him to make furnishings for the tabernacle.

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:53.159
That's quite a responsibility.

00:49:53.159 --> 00:49:56.280
But what experience did Bezalow have?

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:59.679
His last job was making bricks in Egypt.

00:49:59.679 --> 00:50:04.320
While it is possible he had some other skills, how would he accomplish something as grand

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:06.840
as the tabernacle?

00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:14.039
Exodus chapter 35 teaches us that it was Jehovah that gave Bezalow the wisdom and the understanding

00:50:14.039 --> 00:50:16.559
to do the work.

00:50:16.559 --> 00:50:20.440
Jehovah's earthly organization today faces similar challenges.

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:25.880
The brothers that took the lead in setting up our first primary had no prior experience.

00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:30.280
And the same applies to brothers that produced our very first video.

00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:35.519
You will enjoy this archive interview with Brother Lyman Swingle, who was part of that

00:50:35.519 --> 00:50:37.960
very first video team.

00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:42.119
Brother Swingle was later appointed as a member of the governing body until he finished

00:50:42.119 --> 00:50:46.239
his earthly course in 2001.

00:50:46.239 --> 00:50:51.960
The headquarters of the Watchtower Bible and Track Society, a center of new world action.

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:57.920
We were given instructions while finding out make a film of world headquarters and what

00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:01.079
we do here and show it in film.

00:51:01.079 --> 00:51:07.159
Oh, I thought it was a great idea myself because I was interested in photography.

00:51:07.159 --> 00:51:09.480
Bethel means the house of God.

00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:15.000
How many people would like to visit here and don't have the opportunity and let them see

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:21.599
what the new world society is in action, because I think a tour through this place will

00:51:21.599 --> 00:51:25.599
give them the concept of the whole organization.

00:51:25.599 --> 00:51:29.719
They appointed a team of three to write a script.

00:51:29.719 --> 00:51:32.679
So they put this script together.

00:51:32.679 --> 00:51:34.480
Just across the East River from all this.

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:41.559
There was a brother in Hollywood that was connected with the film industry.

00:51:41.559 --> 00:51:46.079
He was sort of an amateur photographer.

00:51:46.079 --> 00:51:50.000
And he was around them all the time and knew their techniques.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.440
It's like many other things the society does.

00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:54.639
They don't have professionals that do it.

00:51:54.639 --> 00:51:59.440
No, mostly they're brought in here and they learn.

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:06.880
Maybe they have a brother like this brother that came here that knew some of the basics.

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:14.840
We went over to New York and rented the lights and many of the equipment that was necessary.

00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:17.639
All he did is bring brought his camera here.

00:52:17.639 --> 00:52:23.480
At his desk, the society's president, Brother Norr, he thought, well, be best to start

00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:30.559
with a president's office and work down through copy, follow the copy through its various

00:52:30.559 --> 00:52:33.440
processes.

00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:38.199
We all work together for one purpose, one does one thing, someone does something else,

00:52:38.199 --> 00:52:46.159
someone working the treasure's office, some have to be president, some have to be dishwashers,

00:52:46.159 --> 00:52:47.159
serve food.

00:52:47.159 --> 00:52:54.280
So it's like the organs in the body, Paul said, you know, the hand can't say to the foot

00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:58.519
I have no need of you, we all need everyone.

00:52:58.519 --> 00:53:01.639
Here is the publication of the New World Society.

00:53:01.639 --> 00:53:06.480
Jehovah has fed us through its pages and he will continue to do so.

00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:11.239
After they had shot it, well, then it had run longer taking it than they expected and

00:53:11.239 --> 00:53:16.159
it got into the time of convention and the brother says, oh, he says, why don't we take

00:53:16.159 --> 00:53:19.559
the convention and put it on here too?

00:53:19.559 --> 00:53:23.360
And so, well, why don't we do it in color?

00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:30.079
Color, those days was really something and that even gave the film a much bigger boost

00:53:30.079 --> 00:53:35.679
when they've been looking black and white and then suddenly they get a burst of color

00:53:35.679 --> 00:53:38.719
for the convention.

00:53:38.719 --> 00:53:45.519
They had the trailer camp where everybody camped out there and Yankee Stadium and all of

00:53:45.519 --> 00:53:46.519
that in color.

00:53:46.519 --> 00:53:53.480
Oh, that really made a real climax to that picture because you weren't used to seeing color

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:56.480
except in the big theaters.

00:53:56.480 --> 00:54:01.039
In the evening, the students told of life a gillian and entertained with a pleasant program

00:54:01.039 --> 00:54:03.920
of songs from their native lands.

00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:09.960
There were some very trying moments wondering whether it's ever going to be completed because

00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:17.940
after we shot it, the brother that shot it was going to edit it too.

00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:21.780
But something came up in his life, he couldn't do it.

00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:26.409
Now we're stuck, what are we going to do?

00:54:26.409 --> 00:54:31.179
So then the decision is, well, let's do it ourselves.

00:54:31.179 --> 00:54:35.860
We'd never done it before, but we'll tackle it and see what we can do.

00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:39.980
And we've got a lab over in New York that we made a deal with them.

00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:46.579
Look, we'll give you the business to duplicate these if you will take somebody over there

00:54:46.579 --> 00:54:49.260
and show them how to edit this thing.

00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:53.980
So for a few weeks I went over there.

00:54:53.980 --> 00:55:00.260
It's like any project here, every job here for the average Bethelite that comes in, he

00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:05.820
doesn't know anything about running a press or washing dishes or anything else.

00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:06.820
We teach him.

00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:11.179
So that was just another job you learn how to do it.

00:55:11.179 --> 00:55:13.139
Amazing things, these.

00:55:13.139 --> 00:55:16.219
But it is Jehovah's spirit that makes them possible.

00:55:16.219 --> 00:55:19.539
It is his work, not man's.

00:55:19.539 --> 00:55:24.539
After we did the original, while we started editing it, we saw there were some gaps in

00:55:24.539 --> 00:55:31.260
the film, not smooth dissolves from one department to another.

00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:40.860
And so the brother had gone away, so we rented a camera again on lights and so on and came

00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:42.619
back and did it all on our own.

00:55:42.619 --> 00:55:51.300
The brothers here filled in some gaps so we could go from some scene to another scene

00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:54.260
real smooth like.

00:55:54.260 --> 00:56:00.539
One of those shows how do you get the paper from the docks up to the press room?

00:56:00.539 --> 00:56:07.139
So we had a scene where they're rolling the paper off the truck right into the camera.

00:56:07.139 --> 00:56:13.019
And then the next scene shows a roll of paper being rolled on to the press and that made

00:56:13.019 --> 00:56:20.019
a nice transition from the docks where the paper comes into the press room.

00:56:20.019 --> 00:56:23.179
And there were some others like that that we filled in later.

00:56:23.179 --> 00:56:29.699
It was a compliment to Jehovah's people putting out something like that back in those days.

00:56:29.699 --> 00:56:34.460
But it illustrates that you don't have to go off to college and get a high education

00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:42.179
to do something if Jehovah's spirit is upon it and blesses the project.

00:56:42.179 --> 00:56:47.900
Many people have benefited from it and it often, in my mind, throws back to what the

00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:52.260
brothers did when they made the photodrama creation.

00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:58.139
They too were amateurs at it but my goodness, look at the final product.

00:56:58.139 --> 00:57:03.579
But this one here was really the only film I think the society made where they planned

00:57:03.579 --> 00:57:10.260
out a script, wrote the script and then followed through and shooting it and editing it and

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:12.739
producing it themselves.

00:57:12.739 --> 00:57:16.579
It's the same way today when the society undertakes something.

00:57:16.579 --> 00:57:24.219
They strike out in open space and start flying and they never flew before but maybe they

00:57:24.219 --> 00:57:30.900
have a few crash landings along the way but they pick themselves up and get back up flying

00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:32.699
again.

00:57:32.699 --> 00:57:37.260
The new world society is indeed in action.

00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:45.420
I think it's another example of how the society has used technology in various features

00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:52.989
to further the advertising of the kingdom all down through the years.

00:57:52.989 --> 00:57:58.070
The new world society in action certainly had a unifying effect.

00:57:58.070 --> 00:58:03.989
By means of that video, brothers and sisters around the world could see where and how our

00:58:03.989 --> 00:58:07.030
literature was produced at the time.

00:58:07.030 --> 00:58:11.630
And if you would like to see the video in its entirety, you can find it in the movies

00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:14.550
category on video on demand.

00:58:14.550 --> 00:58:20.389
The video is entitled The New World Society in Action.

00:58:20.389 --> 00:58:25.849
Have you served Jehovah for many years but now find yourself more limited as your health

00:58:25.849 --> 00:58:27.349
declines?

00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:29.829
That can be so discouraging.

00:58:29.829 --> 00:58:35.230
Please be assured although you are no longer able to do the same things you did in the past,

00:58:35.230 --> 00:58:39.389
you still have a very important role in Jehovah's service.

00:58:39.389 --> 00:58:45.510
Please pay attention to the next video which highlights how one sister used her experience

00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:49.719
to help those in the congregation.

00:58:49.719 --> 00:58:57.079
I never imagined I would be this old in this system of things.

00:58:57.079 --> 00:59:00.800
Time goes by so fast.

00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:08.480
I'm on the infirm pioneer list but it just doesn't feel like enough.

00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:12.880
It seems like yesterday that I had so much youthful energy.

00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:20.750
I look around and I see the younger ones in the hall.

00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:32.940
The congregation is very loving but I just don't feel I have much to give anymore.

00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:37.539
Others could notice I was feeling down.

00:59:37.539 --> 00:59:40.780
I look at the beauty of our young ones.

00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:52.900
What privileges in Jehovah's service await them?

00:59:52.900 --> 01:00:01.719
How I remember the days of my youth?

01:00:01.719 --> 01:00:20.860
For decades I enjoyed the full time service so much has changed.

01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:26.300
In my heart I still feel young.

01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:34.409
But my body wars against me.

01:00:34.409 --> 01:01:15.880
I often reminisce about the old days so many happy memories in Jehovah's service.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:21.750
One of the elders came by with his wife to encourage me.

01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:25.909
He shared Hebrews 6-10 which reads,

01:01:25.949 --> 01:01:33.590
For God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name.

01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:40.309
They reminded me how much Jehovah appreciates whatever I can do now.

01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:45.730
They both had struggled with similar feelings.

01:01:45.730 --> 01:01:54.760
We had such a lovely time.

01:01:54.760 --> 01:02:00.440
I was encouraged to meditate on the account of the needy widow.

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:19.769
And to imagine the look on Jesus' face when he saw her,

01:02:19.769 --> 01:02:31.739
the needy widow gave all that she could out of her want.

01:02:31.739 --> 01:02:38.250
But Jesus and Jehovah loved her very much.

01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:43.210
I know they love me too.

01:02:43.210 --> 01:02:56.860
I can still do so much to encourage others.

01:02:56.860 --> 01:03:08.670
The young ones especially need our help.

01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:12.590
I decided to reach out and encourage them.

01:03:12.590 --> 01:03:37.309
Helping our young ones reach out to serve Jehovah.

01:03:37.309 --> 01:03:40.590
Fills me with such joy.

01:03:40.590 --> 01:04:05.880
I have been able to encourage others to enjoy and start their life

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:25.449
of full-time service. How grateful I am to Jehovah.

01:04:25.449 --> 01:04:29.929
Have you had the opportunity to enjoy public witnessing in your territory

01:04:29.929 --> 01:04:32.489
using a literature display card?

01:04:32.489 --> 01:04:36.809
We have heard many good experiences from this form of the ministry.

01:04:36.809 --> 01:04:40.090
But in this next segment, a music video

01:04:40.090 --> 01:04:45.610
find out what a day in service is like from the perspective of the card.

01:04:45.610 --> 01:04:50.170
This is a big tune which gives that little cart a big heart.

01:04:50.170 --> 01:04:54.329
This is entitled If You Could See What I Say.

01:04:54.329 --> 01:05:07.239
I'm just a cart made up of bits and pieces,

01:05:07.239 --> 01:05:12.829
a frame, a handle, and some wheels.

01:05:12.829 --> 01:05:18.670
But I'm a cart that helps to give a witness.

01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:24.909
What is that like? Let me tell you how it feels.

01:05:24.909 --> 01:05:32.829
If you could see, if you could visit

01:05:32.829 --> 01:05:36.909
all the places that I go,

01:05:36.909 --> 01:05:42.190
if you could see the people there

01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:53.469
and get a glimpse of all the faces that I get to know.

01:05:53.469 --> 01:05:58.269
When they see things they've never had a chance to see.

01:05:58.269 --> 01:06:16.840
That's when you'll see I've got books and I've got tracks.

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:24.909
I take the kingdom message every when you buy

01:06:24.909 --> 01:07:11.309
I'm designed to catch their eye. Talk about a unique perspective.

01:07:11.309 --> 01:07:16.670
Brothers and sisters, it has been a pleasure having you with us this past hour.

01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:22.030
And we would like to take this opportunity to commend every one of you

01:07:22.030 --> 01:07:26.190
for displaying unity in all aspects of your life.

01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:30.670
By doing so, we actually glorify God. Why?

01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:33.949
Because unity identifies true worship.

01:07:33.949 --> 01:07:36.269
Micah 212 says,

01:07:36.269 --> 01:07:41.630
In unity, I shall set them like a flock in the pin.

01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:45.789
Yes, our unity is a treasure worth protecting.

01:07:45.789 --> 01:07:49.389
It brings joy to all those who share in it.

01:07:49.389 --> 01:07:53.070
That's why the Apostle Paul encouraged the Ephesians

01:07:53.070 --> 01:07:56.110
in chapter 4 and verse 3,

01:07:56.110 --> 01:08:01.309
earnestly endeavor to observe the oneness of the spirit.

01:08:01.309 --> 01:08:07.469
It takes effort to have unity in belief and without prejudice.

01:08:07.469 --> 01:08:11.309
To conclude our program, we would like to share some greetings from our brothers

01:08:11.309 --> 01:08:15.469
and sisters in the Zambeziah province in Mozambique.

01:08:15.469 --> 01:08:21.069
Most of the publishers you see are from the Malumbu Central Congregation,

01:08:21.069 --> 01:08:26.029
which is a three and a half hour journey on dirt roads from the nearest big town.

01:08:26.829 --> 01:08:31.789
These publishers had just returned from an isolated group

01:08:31.789 --> 01:08:35.710
that they support about 40 minutes away.

01:08:35.710 --> 01:08:39.550
That group only has three publishers.

01:08:39.550 --> 01:08:44.750
It is our privilege to be united with them in serving Jehovah.

01:08:44.750 --> 01:08:51.149
Indeed it is. This is JW Broadcasting from Brooklyn, New York.
