00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.099
The governing body commends you, brothers and sisters,

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:08.099
who serve Jehovah despite opposition

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.099
from members of your own family.

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.099
To help you endure,

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.100
we would like you to meet sister Priscilla Lagno

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.100
from the United States.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.100
Her experience highlights what can result

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.100
when we endure family opposition.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.420
Paul and I were high school sweethearts,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.420
and after two years of college, we got married.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.420
We started a family, we had three beautiful children.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.420
We were very involved in our church,

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.420
and we were very happy.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.420
Even so, I was searching.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.420
I remembered the scripture of Ephesians 4.5

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.420
that says there's only one true faith.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.420
And so, I wanted that.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.420
I wanted one true faith,

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.420
and so I prayed for God to help me.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.420
So that's when Jehovah's Witnesses knocked at my door

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.420
and offered me a Bible study.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.420
I really loved what I was learning.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.420
I started going to the meetings at the Kingdom Hall.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.420
I started making changes.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.420
And those changes were good for my family,

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.420
but it wasn't making my husband very happy.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.420
He blamed me or my religion for any problem that came up.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.420
He even threatened that he would divorce me.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.420
Some of the things that Paul did to keep me from going to meetings

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.420
or to slow me down was to hide my literature.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.420
He even took parts out of the car,

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.420
so I couldn't use the car to go.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.420
But one of the lowest points was when he would not let me

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.420
take the children to the meetings with me.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.420
It bothered me because I felt it was my responsibility

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.420
to make sure the children learned about Jehovah.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.420
So one memorial I took the children to the Kingdom Hall with me.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.420
Paul wasn't home to take care of them, that's why.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.420
And when we came out of the meeting,

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.419
there was a note on the car that said,

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:10.419
don't bother coming home.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:13.419
So we were able to go to a family member's house

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:15.419
to spend the night.

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:17.419
The next morning we got up,

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:21.419
and he said, we could come home.

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:23.419
So I told the kids to give them a hug.

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:25.419
We brought them a nice treat.

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:28.419
And I remember praying with them.

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:35.419
And I just did not want them to feel that their dad was a bad man.

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:38.419
I wanted them to love their dad.

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:43.419
At this point, I really was convinced I had found the true religion

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:46.419
or that one faith that I had read about in the Bible.

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:49.419
So what I did is I studied secretly with the children.

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:51.419
I didn't want them to make Paul upset.

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:54.419
And as a result, they were well behaved.

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:55.419
They were happy.

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:57.419
And Paul could see that.

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:00.419
And eventually, he allowed them to come to the meetings.

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:05.419
So one day, a Bethel couple invited Paul to tour Patterson.

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:09.419
And because he was in construction work, he was an engineer.

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:12.419
He was very interested and very impressed with the work.

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:13.419
So he agreed to go.

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:18.419
And little by little, he realized that the witnesses,

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.419
the Bethelites were just ordinary people.

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.419
Then there was a big change that showed me

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.419
that Jehovah had really been helping me all along.

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:31.419
And I'm happy to say Paul can tell you about it.

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.419
Well, yes, as Prasol said, I'm an engineer.

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:37.419
And one day on one of our big jobs, we had a leak.

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:41.419
I went to Jehovah in Prayer and I made a bargain with him.

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:44.419
And if he would help me find this leak,

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:47.419
I would go to one meeting with Prasol.

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.419
Mind you, she knew nothing about this prayer.

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:53.419
Well, the very next day, we found that leak.

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:56.419
So that next Sunday, out of the blue,

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.419
I told Prasol that I was going to be going to a meeting with her.

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:02.419
Well, eventually, I started to go into meetings regularly.

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:04.419
I started my own Bible study.

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:08.419
And then about a year later, I got baptized.

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:12.419
I realized over the years, I was missing out on that happiness

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.419
that both Prasol and the children had.

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:19.420
So through Prasol's kindness and submissive matter to me,

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.420
I started changing my view.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.420
Well, Paul's retired now and we're still together.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.420
And we're able to pioneer together, which is a real blessing.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.420
The children are all in full-time service.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.420
And I just always remember that if you trust in Jehovah,

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.420
rely on him, he'll always help you endure.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.420
And I'm so thankful that Prasol stuck it out with me.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.420
And now we have a spiritual family that I would never,

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.420
never want to give up.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.420
What a powerful lesson we can learn from Sister Lagno.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:01.420
Although 10 years went by before her husband joined her in the truth,

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.420
she trusted in Jehovah.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:10.420
We must never lose hope that even opposing family members

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.420
may one day accept the truth.
