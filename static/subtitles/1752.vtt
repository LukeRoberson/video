00:00:05.969 --> 00:00:09.970
My name's Laura. I've served in Bethel for eight years.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.970
I'm from a village called Dunnington, and I have a twin sister.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.969
I'm very shy. I mean, really.

00:00:16.969 --> 00:00:18.969
I can't stress how shy we were.

00:00:18.969 --> 00:00:20.969
Neither of us did speak to anyone.

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:25.969
My Nana was a really big spiritual influence in my life.

00:00:25.969 --> 00:00:29.969
She got really ill. She knew she was going to die, and she said,

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:37.969
Taste and see that Jehovah is good. Please promise me you will try to put everything in serving Jehovah.

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:39.969
That affected me a lot.

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:41.969
I thought, this is it, this is my chance.

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.969
So I went out every Saturday from that moment on, and I got baptized as soon as I could.

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.969
I still couldn't answer at the meetings because I was too shy.

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.969
I still struggled to speak to people at the congregation.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.969
But on the ministry, I was fine.

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:57.969
After pioneering five years, I got married.

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.969
We were going to try our best to do full-time ministry for the rest of our life.

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.969
I really do love Bethel.

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:09.969
I think there's a real link between a good ministry and happiness in Bethel.

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:14.969
So if you love the ministry, then Bethel is excellent place.

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:17.969
For the full eight years I've been in Laundry.

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:21.969
It's a small team. They're only 40. I got to know everyone so well.

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:23.969
I felt so integrated very quickly.

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:28.969
It helped me to feel like it was part of a family.

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:34.969
Knowing that every day, here in Bethel, all our time and energy goes to serving Jehovah.

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:36.969
It's so satisfying.

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:40.969
You feel happy at the end of every day, even if you're tired, mentally or physically.

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:43.969
You've done everything you can for Jehovah.

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:46.969
And you can't beat it really.
