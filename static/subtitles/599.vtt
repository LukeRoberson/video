00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:07.419
Jesus wanted to prepare His apostles for difficult years that lay ahead of them,

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:14.619
and at this occasion He singled out Peter, James and John, and walked them up at lofty mountain.

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:20.820
And maybe He wanted to create a memory that they would never forget.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.620
It seems that the mountain was Mount Hermann.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.420
We do not have to imagine them walking to the top of the mountain.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:34.420
The transfiguration may have taken place on one of the spurs of Mount Hermann.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.420
It is likely night time.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.420
Luke mentions that Peter and those with him they were weighed down with sleep.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.020
But they became fully awake when Jesus was transfigured before them.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.020
And there's likely even more impressive happening in the dark.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.020
Think of it.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:01.219
Jesus' face shining as the sun, His garments became brilliant as lights,

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.019
and then Moses and Elijah appeared talking to Jesus,

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.620
likely talking about Jesus' death and resurrection.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:17.219
So now the disciples they are awake and maybe also somewhat confused.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:24.420
And this is where Peter made the suggestion about three tenths, one for each of them.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.019
Mark says that Peter did not know how to react.

00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:35.819
Luke says that he did not realize what he was saying.

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:40.620
And then a bright cloud covered them and they hear Jehovah's voice.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.819
This is my son, the beloved whom I have approved, listened to him.

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:55.590
So now they are awake and afraid and they fall on their faces.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.989
What do you think here?

00:01:57.989 --> 00:02:00.189
Would they remember this?

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:01.989
Yeah, they did.

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:08.389
More than 60 years later, John is likely making a reference to this in John.

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:15.590
Chapter one verse 14 where he says that we had a preview of his glory.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.990
And Peter for sure, 30 years, more than 30 years later, he is referring to this.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.319
Open your Bibles, please.

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.919
And open to second Peter, chapter one.

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:39.719
Reading from verse 16, this is more than 30 years later, Peter is saying.

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:45.319
No, it was not by following artfully contrived false stories

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.520
that we made known to you the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.319
But rather, we were eyewitnesses of his magnificence.

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:02.520
For we heard from God, for he received from God the Father, honor and glory,

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.520
when words such as these were conveyed to him by the magnificent glory.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.120
This is my son, my beloved whom I myself have approved.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:21.719
Yes, these words we heard coming from the heaven while we were with him on in the Holy Mountain.

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:25.919
So Peter remembered, did it do anything else for him?

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:28.319
Yeah, look at verse 19.

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:34.120
So we have the prophetic word made more sure.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:41.719
And you are doing well in paying attention to it as to a lamb in a dark, shining in a dark place.

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:49.120
So they saw a preview of Jesus as heavenly king.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.319
Peter says, we have the prophetic word made more sure.

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:59.520
Or in other words, it made their faith stronger.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.520
So why did Jesus do this?

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.319
Was that because he felt that their faith was weak?

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.319
No, we have no reason to think that.

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.919
But Jesus knew that they had very difficult years ahead of them

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:16.120
and they needed a strong faith.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.319
They had turbulent years ahead of them, they needed a strong faith.

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:27.519
Like Jesus' death, his resurrection, their whole confusion, that cost for them.

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:34.720
And then there was Holy Spirit, but also persecution, and then later again apostasy.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.519
They needed a strong faith to live through all of this.

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:46.319
You could argue that our situation today is not much different than that of Peter, James and John.

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:51.720
We know that we have difficult years ahead of us.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.920
And we will need a strong faith.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:02.720
I could think that if only I had an experience like that of Peter, James and John,

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:12.120
a vision in the night, in the dark with shining clothes and a cloud and a voice out of heaven,

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.720
yeah, I would remember that.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.519
And it would make my faith stronger.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:27.689
And it would also help me for whatever come in the years that is ahead of us.

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:30.290
We do not have a vision like that today,

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.290
but we do have things around us that are very close to being modern day miracles.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:41.089
And sometimes we can live with a thing for a long time and then we start taking it for granted.

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:45.089
But there are things today that are fantastic and special

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:48.089
and where we do see Jehovah's hand.

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:51.290
Just some examples.

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.889
We are living in a world that is completely divided.

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:58.290
People are at each other's throat.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:06.089
They are divided by politics, borders, color of their skin,

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:08.889
rich poor young old.

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:11.089
We have none of that.

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:17.290
We are living all over the planet and in different backgrounds and cultures.

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:24.089
And we have peace and unity in a world that is completely divided.

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:28.410
We see Jehovah's hand.

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.009
I think every time we see somebody coming into the truth,

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:37.610
making big changes to become one of Jehovah's Witnesses, we see Jehovah's hand.

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:43.009
We know how hard it is to make changes in our own life

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:46.610
and then talk to others and make them change.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.410
No.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.009
But that is what we do.

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:57.410
We study with them and sometimes they make enormous changes to become one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.209
And not because we are pushing them.

00:07:00.209 --> 00:07:04.810
It is basically between them and Jehovah.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:08.009
We see Jehovah's hand.

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:14.209
We see Bible prophecy is being fulfilled today like Matthew 24-14,

00:07:14.209 --> 00:07:16.610
preaching the good news to all the nations.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:17.810
We do that today.

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:21.410
We are preaching the good news all over the planet.

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.610
And we see the results.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.410
We see a great crowd coming into the truth.

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:31.810
We also see a small group of anointeds.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:41.209
I mean, we have among us a group of brothers and sisters anointed with Jehovah's Holy Spirit.

00:07:41.209 --> 00:07:46.410
I mean that Jehovah somehow changed their hope for the future.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:50.810
Most of us we are looking forward to life here on earth.

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.009
But Jehovah changed that for them.

00:07:53.009 --> 00:07:56.610
And they know for sure that they are going to go to heaven.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.610
They will be with Jehovah and Jesus.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:03.279
They are going to rule as kings and priests.

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:05.480
And how do we feel about that?

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.680
Do we have any doubts that this is real?

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.879
No.

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:16.240
We know that this is real.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.439
Many of our brothers and sisters around the world,

00:08:18.439 --> 00:08:22.439
they might have known someone who is anointed or maybe they know somebody.

00:08:22.439 --> 00:08:27.040
And of course, many others have never had that privilege.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:31.839
I think it's safe to say that if you've been a part of the Bethel family for decades,

00:08:31.839 --> 00:08:36.840
here at World Headquarters, then over the years,

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:42.639
you have known many anointed brothers and sisters.

00:08:42.639 --> 00:08:46.039
And how do you feel about that?

00:08:46.039 --> 00:08:52.240
Do we believe that we have a group of anointed brothers and sisters on earth today?

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.840
Yes, we do.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.240
We know that this is real.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.639
We have also seen them, seen their character,

00:09:01.639 --> 00:09:07.039
and their love for the truth, love for Jehovah, love for the ministry.

00:09:07.039 --> 00:09:09.840
We know that this is real.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.639
They are anointed.

00:09:11.639 --> 00:09:16.639
That means we also see Jehovah's hand.

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:20.639
So we do not have a vision of a transfiguration.

00:09:20.639 --> 00:09:30.039
But Jehovah is doing amazing things today like global preaching, peace and unity, two hopes.

00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:37.240
It's all foretold in the Bible and we are living in the middle of all of this.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:43.240
It's important that we see it and then we also see Jehovah's hand.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:49.240
Seeing this, remembering it will help us when we go through hard times.
