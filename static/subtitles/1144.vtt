00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:09.859
Try, if you will, to imagine a virus that becomes a global pandemic.

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:15.419
The Daily News is ominous, fear and panic hold full sway.

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:19.500
Well, that's not too difficult to imagine, isn't it?

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.820
But what if they found a cure?

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.500
Well now instantly the newscaster's tone would change.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.780
He would be enthusiastic.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.980
And why is that?

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.659
Because he has good news to share to the world's population.

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:37.740
Well, how about us?

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.659
Please find Isaiah 52-7.

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:49.219
Isaiah 52-7, why should we be enthusiastic when we teach those who have been exposed to

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.060
the evil viruses of Satan's old world?

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:59.020
Well, it's because we have the best news ever to share with the world's population.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.700
Notice how this is brought out Isaiah 52-7.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:10.269
It says how beautiful on the mountains are the feet of the one bringing good news, the

00:01:10.269 --> 00:01:17.469
one proclaiming peace, the one bringing good news of something better, the one proclaiming

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:23.269
salvation, the one saying in Zion, your God has become king.

00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:30.390
Yes, we have good news that's better than conquering one perturbing virus.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:38.909
Now, in the videos of this symposium, you probably noticed that initially Nida was enthused.

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.909
And a regular Bible study has been established with Jade.

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:49.870
But it's our continued enthusiasm that can help keep a student interested and motivate

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.510
them to act.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:59.870
On the following dramatization, you will note that Nida learns the importance of maintaining

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:21.849
enthusiasm.

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:28.669
Nida, you're focused.

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:31.189
It's Jade again.

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.150
We've only studied once this month.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.430
She's so unscheduled.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.270
I thought you said she was doing well.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.870
She was.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.340
Now it's just, see you later.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.500
How was your last study?

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:52.319
That's a very interesting question, but it's not really what we're talking about in

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:53.599
this paragraph, is it?

00:02:53.599 --> 00:03:04.300
So, let's just read the scripture, shall we?

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.219
In my defense, I was annoyed.

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:13.300
She never even attempts to explain why she can't solve.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.419
I understand.

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:17.419
Really I do.

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:23.300
But if she's still open to studying, you can't let these little things drain your enthusiasm

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.300
I know.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.300
I just...

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.300
I wish she was more structured.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.539
It's like she doesn't take anything seriously.

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:35.379
No study's perfect.

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.379
She's making some effort.

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.379
Focus on that.

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:56.580
If anyone's enthusiastic as a miscontagious, it's yours.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.979
I haven't mentioned it already.

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:02.979
I really love our chats and I appreciate all your questions.

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:04.819
Thanks.

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.819
I know sometimes they're crazy.

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:07.819
No.

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.819
You're a deep thinker.

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:17.009
It's good for both of us.

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:18.009
Okay.

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:19.009
Yeah.

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:31.220
We're cool.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.060
Do you remember when Nita first met Jade?

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.459
Jade said, like I'm jaded.

00:04:39.459 --> 00:04:45.379
The English word jaded means made dull, apathetic or cynical.

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:50.259
And we just noticed that Nita was annoyed with Jade.

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:56.420
She became dull, apathetic, unenthusiastic because of Jade's attitude.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:02.699
But that affected Nita's enthusiasm and it had a circular effect, likely contributing

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:06.180
to Jade's seeming lack of interest.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.579
Well, how do we develop enthusiasm?

00:05:11.579 --> 00:05:19.779
You likely noticed that Nita and Jade, they speak the same language, well, almost.

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:22.060
But there are two totally different personalities.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.660
We could be teaching someone of a totally different cultural background.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:32.540
But the good news is enthusiasm crosses all boundaries.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.379
Please find with me Romans 12-11.

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:44.899
And it's good to remember that enthusiasm is not just some giddy outward show of excitement.

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:54.339
It actually happens from within us, Romans 12-11, be industrious, not lazy, be a glow with

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:58.339
the spirit, slave for Jehovah.

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:03.459
We want to highlight that matter of being a glow with the spirit.

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:08.579
The word translated a glow literally means boiling.

00:06:08.579 --> 00:06:14.740
So to maintain enthusiasm, we need a constant flow of God's Holy Spirit.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.420
That's like the heat source that keeps us boiling.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.180
So how do we prepare to teach a Bible student?

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:29.420
Well, we might think, well, I like to go over the lesson in advance and I remind myself

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.540
of what the cited scriptures say.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:33.540
And that's good.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:34.980
That's necessary.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.100
But that all is just happening in our head.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.980
How do we get the water boiling inside?

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:46.579
Do you remember the suggestion in Ezra 7-10?

00:06:46.579 --> 00:06:50.779
Ezra there said that he prepared his heart to teach.

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:56.139
Well, if that thought in mind, please find Psalm 45-1.

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:58.660
We need to click the download button.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.180
We need to download from our head to our heart.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.779
Notice how the heart's involved here.

00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:09.939
Psalm 45-1 says, My heart, it does not say my head.

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:13.620
My heart is stirred by something good.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.980
I say, my song is about a king.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:22.019
May my tongue be the stylus of a skilled copious.

00:07:22.019 --> 00:07:24.420
It said, my heart is stirred.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:32.100
Well, interestingly, the word translated stirred also means to boil or bubble up.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.740
And what's the result if we get that action going inside of us?

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:41.939
The end of the verse said that my tongue, in other words, my speech will be skilled.

00:07:41.939 --> 00:07:48.939
Yes, we improve our skills as a disciple maker when we maintain enthusiasm.

00:07:48.939 --> 00:07:56.939
And we get our enthusiasm bubbling, boiling, stirred up when we meditate on the importance

00:07:56.939 --> 00:08:00.699
of the lesson we're about to teach.

00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:04.220
My wife likes to watch cooking shows on television.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:08.939
And I've noticed that invariably, there's always an electric blender.

00:08:08.939 --> 00:08:15.100
I do realize that in some of your cultures, you might prefer mortar and pestle, a sharp

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.939
knife to cut things up and mix them together.

00:08:17.939 --> 00:08:22.620
But we have all those ingredients laid out on the counter before us, maybe vegetables,

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.939
herbs, spices, always salt and pepper.

00:08:25.939 --> 00:08:28.259
What is that like?

00:08:28.259 --> 00:08:31.220
It's like having the ingredients in our mind.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.740
We've gone over the lesson in advance.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:34.740
We have the scriptures.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.580
We know what they say.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:42.620
But we really don't get enthused about that tasty dish until what happens.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.620
We mix all those ingredients in the blender.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.259
We bring it up to temperature, maybe even a boil.

00:08:48.259 --> 00:08:55.299
And then after the dish is done and we taste it, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, it tastes so good.

00:08:55.299 --> 00:08:57.019
We get enthusiastic.

00:08:57.019 --> 00:08:59.500
We tell others about this great recipe.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:05.299
Now they're interested and they want to taste this culinary sensation as well.

00:09:05.299 --> 00:09:08.460
So how do we become enthusiastic?

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.460
Meditate.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.220
Meditation is the blender.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.460
We take all the ingredients in our mind.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:20.620
We mix them together into a message that we're now enthused to share with others.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:25.700
And meditation includes asking ourselves questions to prepare the heart.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:33.139
For example, before your study, you might ask, how has this information benefited me personally?

00:09:33.139 --> 00:09:38.379
And need, I needed to ask herself, why does Jade need to hear this?

00:09:38.379 --> 00:09:41.820
Maybe it's the perfect point at the right time for our student.

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:48.779
And so we should ask, how will what I'm going to study benefit my student?

00:09:48.779 --> 00:09:51.500
Meditation stirs the heart.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:58.179
Please find with me first lesson in chapter one.

00:09:58.179 --> 00:10:04.019
Seasim or zeal should not be confused with being overly emotional.

00:10:04.019 --> 00:10:09.700
That'd be like throwing too much hot pepper into the blender over emotional.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:15.700
And our heartfelt conviction should not cross the line and become dogmatic as to what

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.220
our student must believe.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:24.500
See if you get the sense of this recipe in 1 Thessalonians 1-5.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:29.500
It says because the good news we preach did not come to you with speech alone.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:33.100
In other words, not just words out of the head, but notice the ingredients.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:40.299
It says also with power and with Holy Spirit and with strong conviction.

00:10:40.299 --> 00:10:44.379
When we've meditated on the material and we deliver it from the heart,

00:10:44.379 --> 00:10:48.419
it's reflected in our gestures, our facial expressions.

00:10:48.419 --> 00:10:56.100
We come across as natural, sincere, but you see animated with proper enthusiasm.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:03.299
If you're enthusiastic about Bible truths, it is contagious, but in a very good way.

00:11:03.299 --> 00:11:08.620
Your Bible student will not become jaded, dull, apathetic.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:15.620
Instead, your student will be enthusiastic just like you, his teacher.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:19.179
And now we have the privilege of having brother Seth Hyatt.

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:24.179
He's a helper for the service committee to present the next part on our symposium.

00:11:24.179 --> 00:11:30.179
Experience the joy of disciple making, improve your skills, showing empathy.
