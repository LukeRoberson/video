WEBVTT

00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:08.650
sight, hearing, taste, touch, smell.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.289
Well, as you know, those are the five primary senses

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:15.130
with which the Creator has endowed us.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.170
But now, which one of these five is perhaps

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.210
the closedliest related to are being able to gain

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.690
the prize of everlasting life?

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.969
Well, is it not hearing?

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:29.649
It's interesting throughout history,

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:33.689
the churches of Baben the Great have put the main emphasis

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:39.009
not on hearing, but on seeing, or perhaps touching,

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:41.649
seeing an image of their God, maybe touching

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:43.729
or kissing that image.

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:48.450
But Jehovah has always put the emphasis on hearing.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.130
Here, O Israel, give ear and listen.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.530
With commanding calls such as this,

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.689
the Israelites were summoned together

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:01.729
to hear Jehovah's words read and explained.

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:05.370
Well, similarly, today, we have many opportunities

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.849
to hear Jehovah's words read and explain.

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:10.689
But now, here's a question.

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.689
Is it sufficient that we just hear the sounds of Jehovah's words?

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.530
Well, you know, that's not sufficient.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.409
I hear an experience that illustrates this.

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.129
Many years ago, I was working in service with a brother.

00:01:25.129 --> 00:01:27.010
It was his turn to talk.

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:27.969
He was very nervous.

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:29.129
The lady came to the door.

00:01:29.129 --> 00:01:30.209
He said, how are you?

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:32.129
She said, not very good.

00:01:32.129 --> 00:01:34.170
He said, that's good.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.530
And he proceeded with his presentation.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.650
Well, he heard sounds coming out of her mouth,

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.049
but he didn't hear so as to perceive what was said.

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.010
Well, obviously, Jehovah expects us to do

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.250
a whole lot better than that

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.969
when it comes to hearing his words.

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:55.290
In Matthew 13, 16, today's scripture text,

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.290
Jesus committed his disciples by saying,

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.129
happy are your ears because they hear.

00:02:03.129 --> 00:02:04.609
Now, he wasn't committing them

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:07.530
for just hearing sounds coming out of his mouth,

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.289
but he was committing them because they heard

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.090
with understanding, they grasped the meaning,

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.889
and then they were in position to make application

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:18.650
of what they had heard.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.650
Well, do we want Jehovah and Jesus

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.009
to pronounce our ears happy?

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:27.729
Do we want figuratively happy ears?

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:29.370
We do, don't we?

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.090
Well, then we must listen like those disciples in a way

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.729
we grasp the meaning and are in position to make application.

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:40.770
Open up to Mark chapter four, please.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.770
And here's an interesting scripture in this vein.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.009
I notice the words of Jesus,

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:49.770
Mark chapter four beginning in verse 23.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.449
He said, whoever has ears to listen,

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:56.530
let him listen.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.169
He further said to them, pay attention to what you are hearing.

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:04.810
I notice this with a measure that you are measuring out,

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.050
you will have it measured out to you.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.090
Yes, you will have more added to you.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.969
So notice, Jesus was saying that if you measure out

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:18.969
little interest in attention, don't expect to gain much.

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:22.090
In contrast, if you measure out your full attention

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.289
and interest to what I am saying,

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:26.449
then I will give you generously,

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:29.289
even beyond your expectations.

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:31.530
Well, it works the same way today, doesn't it?

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.050
We actually reap enlightenment in direct proportion

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.969
to how much interest and attention we measure out.

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:41.449
I go to Hebrews chapter two.

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:42.689
Here's another scripture.

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:46.210
Very familiar scripture in this regard.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.770
Hebrews chapter two, and notice we're not to just

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.849
pay casual attention or even usual attention,

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:56.889
but notice how it's worded.

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:01.490
Hebrews two verse one, that is why it is necessary

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.530
for us to pay more than the usual attention

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.409
to the things we have heard so that we never drift away.

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.810
So it's absolutely required if we're not going to drift away

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.770
from Jehovah or the truth,

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.889
we've got to pay more than the usual attention.

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.089
Now let's illustrate this point.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:26.930
I like to imagine that you're trapped in a building

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.449
that is engulfed in fire.

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.089
A fireman makes his way to you.

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:34.290
And he says, only have time to tell you this once.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.730
I've got to go help other people, but there's only one way

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.250
to escape.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.009
You've got to go down this stairs very quickly.

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:44.009
When you get to the bottom, drop down on your stomach

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:45.329
and begin crawling.

00:04:45.329 --> 00:04:47.930
You have to stay within three feet of the floor

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.129
because above that, there are poisonous gases.

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:53.930
A crawl though to the right.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.569
And you will see a small hallway, a narrow hallway.

00:04:57.569 --> 00:04:59.529
Crawl through that hallway.

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:02.410
When you get to the end, you'll be in the lobby, stand up,

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.250
turn left, run off the exit doors.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.170
Now, while those instructions were being given,

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.569
would you allow your mind to wander?

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:14.449
Would you be thinking, I wonder what I'll have for supper

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:16.610
tonight?

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.050
When would I be on TV?

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.009
No, your attention would be riveted,

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:25.769
because one misdetail could cost you your life.

00:05:25.769 --> 00:05:29.410
And even after the fireman left, you probably

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.329
would still hear ringing in your ears his words

00:05:32.329 --> 00:05:36.050
as you reviewed them in your mind, say, down the stairs,

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.250
crawl through the hallway, go out the left of the lobby

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.410
through the exit doors.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.050
You'd be reviewing that information.

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:48.329
With the idea, you are truly going to make application.

00:05:48.329 --> 00:05:50.649
Well, that's how we want to listen.

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:52.850
And if you think about it, we're in a similar situation,

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.129
aren't we?

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:57.329
Satan's world is on fire around us.

00:05:57.329 --> 00:06:00.730
And very soon, it's going to totally burn up.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:04.129
But Jehovah is giving us escape instructions.

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:06.850
In fact, in 2 Peter 312 about this system,

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.769
it says that it's going to be destroyed in flames

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:14.730
and the elements will melt in the intense heat.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.649
But we want to survive.

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:20.370
We don't even slightly want to be like the idols mentioned

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:26.170
in Psalm 115, verse 6, who have ears, but they don't hear.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.250
Or like the cobra mentioned in Psalm 584

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.290
that stops up its ears and refuses

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.370
to hear the voice of the charmer.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:40.649
Or like the disobedient Israelites described in Isaiah 6.10

00:06:40.649 --> 00:06:43.730
as having unresponsive ears.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.290
Or those disobedient Israelites are described

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:50.009
in Jeremiah 6.10 in the literal Hebrew

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:53.170
as having uncircumcized ears.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:56.930
We don't even want to be like the Hebrew Christians

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.410
who are described in Hebrews chapter 5, verse 11

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.730
as being dull in their hearing.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:08.329
We want to do our very best to uncover our ear.

00:07:08.329 --> 00:07:11.730
Now that's an interesting expression in the literal Hebrew

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.449
in Job 36, verse 10.

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:16.129
And apparently it comes from the fact

00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:20.209
that the orientals were a headdress.

00:07:20.209 --> 00:07:23.810
But to hear more clearly, they would partially remove

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.930
that headdress and uncover the ear.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.250
Well, we want to do that ourselves.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:33.529
We want to incline our ear, Psalm 78, verse 1,

00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:37.009
awaken our ear, open our ear, give ear

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:39.689
as different verses in Isaiah say.

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:42.009
And all of that is pay attention with the view

00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:46.009
of making application of what we have heard.

00:07:46.009 --> 00:07:50.449
Now if we do this, use our sense of hearing wisely.

00:07:50.449 --> 00:07:54.930
As we've discussed, then we'll be in position to survive

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:59.930
the cataclysmic end of this system of things.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:04.810
As recorded at second Kings 21, verse 12,

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:08.689
Jehovah said, here I am bringing such a disaster

00:08:08.689 --> 00:08:13.610
on Jerusalem and Judah that it will make both ears

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:17.649
of anyone who hears about it, tingle.

00:08:17.649 --> 00:08:20.810
Well, it's true, during the Great Tribulation,

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.290
people of this world, when they hear

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:26.129
about the calamitous events of the Great Tribulation,

00:08:26.129 --> 00:08:28.810
undoubtedly both of their ears,

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:31.529
figuratively, figuratively for sure,

00:08:31.529 --> 00:08:34.570
but perhaps even literally, will tingle.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:38.529
But the ears of Jehovah's people will continue

00:08:38.529 --> 00:08:41.129
incline toward Jehovah's directions

00:08:41.129 --> 00:08:44.450
that will come at that time, such as found at Isaiah 26,

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:49.049
verse 20, where Jehovah will say, go, my people,

00:08:49.049 --> 00:08:53.610
enter your inner rooms and shut your doors behind you,

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:56.090
hide yourself for a brief moment

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:58.730
until the wrath has passed by.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:03.730
And as Jesus declared the ears of his disciples happy,

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:07.769
Jehovah in Jesus will be able to declare

00:09:07.769 --> 00:09:12.450
the ears of the surviving great crowd happy.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:17.610
They will say to them, a happy are your ears

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:18.850
because they hear.
