00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.000
The Watchtower comment for today makes a very bold statement when it says

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.359
Satan uses movies and television shows to spread his way of thinking.

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:23.199
And so that thought alone should cause anyone that loves Jehovah to think twice before we turn on a television

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:26.079
or a monitor.

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:32.000
Concerning this method that Satan uses to spread his thinking, the Watchtower comment further says,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.159
he understands that storytelling does much more than entertain us.

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:42.960
It teaches us how to think, feel, and act.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.679
So when choosing our entertainment, we need to remember that Satan's storytelling

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.640
has had a detrimental effect upon people for generations.

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:02.079
If you look at Isaiah 55 and verse 7,

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:14.180
55 and verse 7, the results can be seen. It says, let the wicked man leave his way and the evil man

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:22.739
his thoughts. So the person that is taught by Satan will have his thinking corrupted

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:27.939
and in time will end up as an evil and wicked individual.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:39.219
Now, verses 8 and 9 shows us that imperfect thinking is separate from Jehovah God's thinking.

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:40.420
Now, notice what it says.

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:48.019
And verse 8, for my thoughts are not your thoughts and your ways are not my ways,

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:55.379
declares Jehovah. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so my ways are higher than yours

00:01:55.379 --> 00:02:02.900
and my thoughts than your thoughts. So while the verse is talking about an evil and wicked

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:09.139
individual, somewhere along the way, that individual was an imperfect individual only.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:14.740
And so something happened to push them in the evil and the wicked category.

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:19.139
Well, it was being taught by Satan the devil. That's what happened.

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:26.180
So today, we're all imperfect individuals. So how can we maintain

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.979
Jehovah's thinking so that we don't get pushed in the category of evil and wicked?

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:40.659
Well, it is the fact that Jehovah also uses storytelling to help us to adapt our thinking to

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:46.900
Jehovah's thinking. In fact, the Bible is filled with the experiences of individuals both good

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.300
and bad. The Bible gives us many illustrations and many stories that touch the heart

00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:00.740
that helps us to understand timeless principles and Bible laws that will help us in our decision

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:08.180
process so that our ways can become like Jehovah's ways. Let's take an example.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.139
Now, throughout the Bible, it really highlights Jehovah's forgiving nature.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:20.900
And let's talk about that. Let's go to Exodus, first of all, Exodus 34. And we'll read verse 7.

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:28.340
Now, remember, we're being taught Jehovah's way of forgiveness. So it says this,

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:36.900
showing loyal love to thousands, pardoning error and transgression and sin. Well,

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:44.180
that's Jehovah's forgiving nature. And then if you turn to Isaiah, chapter 1 and verse 18,

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:56.419
notice how he paints a picture about this for us. Isaiah 1 and verse 18. He says,

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:04.020
come now and let us set matter straight between us, says Jehovah. Though your sins are like scarlet,

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:12.180
they will be made as white as snow. Though they are as red as crimson cloth, they will become

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:19.779
like wool. And so there again, identifying this is Jehovah's way. Now, to touch our heart and

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:27.540
really go to the core of the matter, he has a story told. And in fact, Jesus did that. It's found in

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:35.779
Luke chapter 15 about the prodigal or the lost son. Chapter 15, verse 11, now we're not going to

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:41.300
read it, but I'll start to tell the story in just a few sentences. If you look at verse 11,

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:47.939
there was a man that had two sons. And in verse 12, the younger son took his inheritance,

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:57.060
verse 13, he traveled to a distant country and squandered his inheritance. And then 15 and 16,

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:04.339
he became destitute. 17, he finally came to his senses. And returned to his father. And

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:12.420
verse 20 shows that his father caught sight of him and was moved with pity. And he ran and embraced

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:20.899
him and tenderly kissed him. Now, what are some of the lessons that Jehovah's teaching us by means

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:29.379
of this story? Well, first of all, Jehovah yearns to extend forgiveness. It's his forgiving nature.

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:37.860
And just like that father, we recognize that sinners may waste resources given them.

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:47.699
We never lose hope that a sinner will return and will give a warm reception when they do return to

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:55.860
Jehovah God. Centres can be restored completely and regain a place in the family of Jehovah.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:02.899
And finally, we learn that sinners may have to hit rock bottom before they return to their senses.

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:07.779
Don't you agree? These are valuable lessons that helps us to understand

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:16.019
Jehovah's thinking and to adapt our imperfect thinking to his. Now, a part of using this as an

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:22.339
illustration, the the Neuro translation takes a little over 500 words to give this story.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:30.819
But less than 10 are used to describe the wrongdoing of the prodigal son. If you look in verse 13,

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:38.740
it says he was living a debauched life. And then in verse 30, a few more details when it says he

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:46.740
squandered his belongings with prostitutes. So here's an example of a story that contains

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:54.180
some wrongdoing, but in no way does it spotlight it? Does it glorify it or make it attractive?

00:06:54.180 --> 00:07:00.500
Rather, it draws us closer to Jehovah God, helping us to understand his forgiving nature.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:08.500
That's just why the story was written. Now, we can only imagine how Satan would

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:17.939
twist the storyline of the prodigal son. Would he portray the father as restrictive and intolerant?

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:26.980
Would he show the rebellious son's home, home life as oppressive and stifles his independence?

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:33.860
Would he insert some disrespectful or obscene language in the script?

00:07:34.819 --> 00:07:40.740
How much time do you imagine that he would devote to the immoral aspects of the story?

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:49.459
And when the son returns home, would he be repentant? Or would the father be portrayed as

00:07:49.459 --> 00:07:58.579
mellowing and becoming tolerant? Might the son even return home with one of the women that he

00:07:58.579 --> 00:08:06.579
was with? You see, with Satan's stories, when we read between the lines, there's always

00:08:06.579 --> 00:08:16.899
filth and untruth. The story content is a repeating plot, a plot of rebellion of violence and

00:08:16.899 --> 00:08:25.699
immorality. See, it's the same basic story told over and over again with different characters.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:35.220
But with Jehovah's stories, when we read it, we discover something every time. In fact,

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:43.299
when we meditatively read between the lines, the story blossoms, doesn't it? It seems no matter how

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:50.580
often we read the story, we learn something about Jehovah that we can adapt to our own thinking.

00:08:51.539 --> 00:08:58.019
So in making decisions regarding entertainment, we need to reason on the matter.

00:08:59.059 --> 00:09:07.620
See, who is teaching me? Will the entertainment refresh me and accomplish something good for me?

00:09:08.659 --> 00:09:16.580
Or is it a chance that it will undermine my faith in Jehovah God? If in doubt, wouldn't it be wise

00:09:16.659 --> 00:09:24.419
to simply refrain? So while in this system, we need to be careful about our entertainment choices.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:32.659
Let's be taught by Jehovah so we can think and feel and reason on matters as he does

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:40.980
as we look forward to the time when the only option available to us will be safe and wholesome

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:41.860
in entertainment.
