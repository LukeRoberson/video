00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:31.129
Before the meeting starts, I need to get things ready.

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:33.570
I'm Ben.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:44.520
And as a minister or servant, I can do a lot to help the congregation.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.719
And that night, I was given another assignment.

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.799
Brother Richens asked if I could help him update the territory maps and organise our schedules

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:58.289
for public witnessing.

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.490
And I think the brothers know I can modernise all of this.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.409
Brother Richens said to talk to brother Bello first.

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.769
He was the service I was seeing for years.

00:01:11.769 --> 00:01:20.219
Great idea, but I can already imagine the possibilities.

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:27.799
By that weekend, I had almost finished.

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:34.219
I couldn't believe the outdated ways our records were kept.

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:38.180
This is going to be way better for the congregation.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:46.739
And who knows what else could be improved.

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:51.299
I thought I had everything ready to show brother Richens.

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.780
He liked the new ideas.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.540
But then he asked me, what did brother Bello think?

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.500
Oh brother Bello, I forgot.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.710
I should have asked him, but at this point, didn't really matter.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.569
Brother Richens suggested we read about a Lysha.

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.409
When the older Elijah's work was ending, a Lysha start close to his teacher.

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:25.289
Urged to stay behind, a Lysha repeatedly said,

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:36.270
As surely as Jehovah is living and as you are living, I will not leave you.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:52.939
Until the moment Elijah left, Elijah wanted to learn from him.

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:59.300
Like a son, asking his father, he wanted a double portion of Elijah's spirit to continue

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.870
the work he started.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:11.189
And Elijah's first miracle was the same as Elijah's last,

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:17.349
dividing the Jordan with Elijah's official garment.

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:25.729
Everything Elijah did revealed his respect for the experienced man Elijah.

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:31.580
I wasn't finished with my new assignment after all.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.939
There was a lot I needed to learn from brother Bello.

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:43.949
He really understood our preaching territory and the people who live here.

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:50.349
He liked my ideas, but everything he showed me made them even better.

00:03:50.349 --> 00:04:12.069
I can do a lot to help the congregation.

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:19.310
And I pray that Jehovah lets me do even more with the gifts he gave me and with the wisdom

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.629
of experienced men.
