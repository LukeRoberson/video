00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:11.910
About 28 years after Jesus' death, the Apostle Paul provided comfort to the brothers by means of our scripture text today.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.910
By means of this wonderful promise when Jehovah said,

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.910
I will not forget you, your works, and your love.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.910
Now, why would the fact that Jehovah does not forget be of comfort to the brothers?

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.910
Don't you agree that if you tell somebody that you don't forget him or what he has done,

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.909
can have completely different meaning depending on the person and the circumstances?

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:43.909
Let us therefore focus on the meaning of Jehovah does not forget.

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:50.909
In order to make this discussion practical, maybe talk specifically to you, dear sisters,

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:56.909
who lost your husband in death or whose husband was unfaithful.

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:05.909
Similar to your situation, there must have been widows in Judea back then who went not only through the pain of losing their maid,

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.909
but also had to deal with all the changes as well as economical and social challenges.

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.909
Therefore, you want to answer the following three questions.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.909
How did Jehovah remember or not forget the widows' seraphas?

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.909
And then second, in what ways does Jehovah remember you, dear sisters, today?

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:34.909
And then thirdly, how can we all benefit from Jehovah's remembering?

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.909
So first of all, how did Jehovah remember the widows' seraphas?

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.909
And I'd like to invite you to turn to 1 Kings 17.

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.909
As we know, during a drought, the Prophet Elijah was directed by God

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:55.909
to go to seraphas in order to be saved and kept alive through the help of a widow.

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.909
So Jehovah remembered the widow in that he took note of her.

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.909
He saw her, he knew she would be willing to help and to be used by him.

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.909
Jehovah saw her potential.

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:11.909
Would the poor widow really help?

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:16.909
We read in verses 15 and 16 of 1 Kings 17.

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:19.909
So she, the widow, went and did as Elijah said,

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:25.909
and she, together with him and her household, ate for many days.

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:30.909
The large jar of flour did not run out and the small jar of oil did not run dry,

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:36.909
according to Jehovah's word that he had spoken through Elijah.

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.909
Jehovah miraculously fed Elijah.

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:41.909
Did he forget the widow?

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:45.909
No. Jehovah became a saviour to the widow.

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:51.909
Instead of dying, the widow continued eating and drinking.

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:58.909
And even some time later, Jehovah did not forget the widows' faith and their words, household.

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:04.909
After the death of the widow's son, Elijah asked Jehovah to resurrect the son.

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.909
We read in verses 22 and 24 to 24.

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:17.909
And Jehovah listened to Elijah's request and the life of the child came back into him and he revived.

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:23.909
Elijah took the child and brought him down from the roof chamber into the house and gave him to his mother.

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.909
And Elijah said, see your son is alive.

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:29.909
At that, the woman said to Elijah,

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:38.909
Now I know that you truly are a man of God and that Jehovah's word in your mouth is truth.

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:40.909
What a blessing for the widow.

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:43.909
Jehovah did not forget her work and faith.

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:48.909
What a joyous moment. Jehovah became the great comforter.

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:54.909
Additionally, by means of her resurrected son, Jehovah cared for her as she grew old.

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.909
Jehovah became the great provider.

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.909
In Luke 4, Jesus makes a positive reference about her.

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:07.909
So it could be that she could live out her days as a faithful servant of Jehovah.

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:15.909
How delighted she will be when Jehovah will remember her soon again and resurrect her.

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:25.910
So as we've seen in this example, Jehovah does not forget by becoming what the individual needs the most.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:32.910
Now to our second Christians, our dear sisters, in what ways does Jehovah remember you today?

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.910
Let us please look at three scriptures to see what Jehovah becomes for you.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.910
Let's turn first of all to John chapter 14.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:48.910
Because Jehovah knows that your maid who commanded you and who assured you in the past is not here anymore.

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:54.910
What helped Jesus to know that he was loved and approved?

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.910
He was strengthened by his father's approval, by his words.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.910
And now, Jesus assures you in verse 21.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.910
This is John 14, verse 21, when he says,

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:13.910
whoever has my commandments on observes them is the one who loves me.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.910
In turn, whoever loves me will be loved by my father.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:23.910
And I will love him and will clearly show myself to him.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:31.910
So, Jehovah loves you. Please, do not allow Satan to create doubts in your mind.

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.910
Doubts regarding our Heavenly Father's approval.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:43.910
Instead, see the commendation and the love expressed by your brothers and sisters as coming from Jehovah.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:50.910
Jehovah uses them because he does not forget your works and your love.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.910
Now, the second scripture is Psalm 68.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.910
Jehovah knows about the need you feel for security and protection.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.910
So, he is becoming your protector.

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.910
We read in verse 5 of Psalm 68,

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:17.910
about Jehovah, a father of the father less enter, protector of widows.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:22.910
You are especially protected by our Heavenly Father.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.910
For example, he protects you from spiritual harm.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.910
He equips you with what you need in order to avoid danger,

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.910
and so you are able to safeguard your friendship with him.

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:41.910
By means of his word and the publication, Jehovah makes his loving guidance and protection stand out to you.

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:46.910
Now, let's turn to the third scripture, Hebrews 13.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.910
Losing a husband goes along with anxiety regarding material things.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.910
So, what did you experience so far?

00:06:54.910 --> 00:07:00.910
Did Jehovah's promise that is repeated by the Apostle Paul here in Hebrews 13,

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:05.910
at the end of verse 5, proved to be true in your circumstances?

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.910
When he promised, I will never leave you.

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:14.189
I will never abandon you.

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:20.189
Jehovah does not forget your works in your love by becoming your provider.

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:24.189
And please, allow other brothers and sisters to help you.

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:27.189
This is the way Jehovah remembers you.

00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:33.189
Mention your needs to them so that Jehovah can use them to care for you.

00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:37.189
So, Jehovah does not forget your works, your love,

00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:43.189
by assuring you of his approval, by becoming your protector

00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:48.189
and your provider in many more ways.

00:07:48.189 --> 00:07:55.189
Now, our final question was, how can you and how can we all benefit from Jehovah's remembering?

00:07:55.189 --> 00:08:00.189
What we discussed so far was something you heard many times before, nothing new.

00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:09.189
And yet, there are these moments where we just would like Jehovah to speak directly to us saying,

00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:16.189
I see you, I see your works, I see your love and I will not forget you.

00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:20.189
What can we do in these very moments?

00:08:20.189 --> 00:08:26.189
Now, God's words need to sound down in our mind and heart

00:08:26.189 --> 00:08:28.189
so that we are influenced by it.

00:08:28.189 --> 00:08:30.189
How can we accomplish this?

00:08:30.189 --> 00:08:35.190
By allowing our Bible reading to affect us deep inside.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:40.190
So, as we meditate about what we read, we can ask us the question,

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:44.190
do I really believe what I just read?

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:53.190
Why am I sure that Bible examples are not isolated events but are pattern of Jehovah's dealings with these loyal ones?

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:59.190
Have I not seen and experienced this personally?

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:07.190
Don't I see very good reason to believe that through the Scriptures, Jehovah is talking to me personally?

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:16.190
Meditating about these questions will help us to feel Jehovah's sentiments are meant for us personally.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:23.500
And this in turn will help us to align our thinking with God's thinking.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:35.500
So, the widow of Saraphat reminded us of the many different ways Jehovah remembers widows and their love and their fine works.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:49.500
Dear sisters, please continue to see Jehovah as your provider, your protector and the one that assures you personally of his love.
