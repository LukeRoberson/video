00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.320
Hello, everyone.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:10.519
I bring you warm greetings from the governing body and the United States Bethel family.

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.199
We want you to know that we love you all very much.

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:20.199
We're concerned about you, and we pray for you each and every day.

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:25.280
We know that more and more of you are being affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.280
You can't go to work.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.399
You can't go to school.

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:33.600
You can't go to the Kingdom Hall or preach from house to house.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.679
Some of you have lost your jobs, and you have no idea how you're going to be able to feed

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:39.960
your family.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.719
Others have family members who live far away.

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.679
There's no one else in the house.

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:47.159
They're worried about them.

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:53.640
And sadly, some are mourning the loss of loved ones who have been victims of the disease.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.719
We want you to know that our heart aches for you.

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.240
We're so sorry for your loss.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:06.680
Now these are very stressful times, but it's important to remember one thing.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.120
No friend of Jehovah is ever truly alone.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.560
Through his Holy Spirit, Jehovah can help us, he can sustain us, even if there's no one

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.920
else in the house.

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:25.719
Another way Jehovah is helping us is by means of caring shepherds.

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:28.799
And this is in line with the promise that he himself made.

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.439
We're going to read Jeremiah chapter 23 and verse 4.

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.439
And you'll see how this prophecy is being fulfilled today.

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.400
I'm just going to read a part of it.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:46.439
Here's the promise Jehovah made that he was going to raise up shepherds who will really

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.480
shepherd them.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.840
And at the end it says none of them will be missing.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.319
Well can you see how that promise is being fulfilled today and the elders?

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:03.439
Just think of all the work our elders are doing to make sure that we don't miss out on

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.799
spiritual food, for example.

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.240
They're arranging for us to tie into congregation meetings.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.280
They set up shepherding calls using video conferencing.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.400
They arrange for meetings for field service and they make sure we have telephone territory

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.360
and letter writing territory.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.960
Of course these shepherds are also concerned about your physical well-being.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.960
So from time to time they may also check in on us to make sure that we have basic food

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.439
items, medications, and other necessary things.

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:40.800
Now if they do that, don't be shy, let the elders know your needs.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.360
They may also provide practical suggestions on how you can protect your health.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.599
Now as you can imagine, when the pandemic broke out the elders had a lot of questions.

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.520
They'd never dealt with this before.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.039
And suddenly they needed to do all kinds of things that they hadn't done before, set

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:04.879
up video conferencing accounts, learn how to use new apps like Skype and Zoom.

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.280
What's that?

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.439
They become familiar with how to organize an entire congregation meeting online.

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:17.599
It's been a huge task for our brothers and we want to commend them for the excellent

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.599
job they're doing.

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:26.479
The elders had a lot of questions, but through his organization Jehovah provided the direction

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:31.080
they needed and an experience from Canada will bring this out.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.400
Let's watch a video in which Brother Warren Schufeld, a member of the Canada Branch Committee,

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.319
explains what happened in Canada.

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:47.719
In the face of the coronavirus threat, a body of elders near the Canada branch recently

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:51.919
met to determine how to go forward with congregation meetings.

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:57.360
They had so many questions how to balance the spiritual needs of the brothers with government

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.520
regulations on gatherings.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.319
They prayed to Jehovah for guidance.

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.960
But as their meeting went on, it still wasn't clear to them how to proceed.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.159
And then one of the brothers noticed on his electronic device, a letter from the branch

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:14.680
with instructions to the elders.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.439
As they read through it, it answered all their questions and even some they hadn't anticipated.

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:26.720
They viewed this as Jehovah's answer to their prayers, but now they had less than 24 hours

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:32.639
to prepare their first ever congregation meeting by video conference.

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.160
Prayerfully, they followed the instructions step by step.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.920
And the next evening, the whole congregation gathered for a meeting by video conference.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.639
The attendance was well over 100%.

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.399
And one of the families that was in attendance, wrote to the elders,

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:57.800
we are so grateful for all the effort to provide this much needed spiritual food live.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.639
It was exactly what we needed.

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:04.860
Thank you.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.100
What an encouraging experience that was.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.259
Thanks, Warren.

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:09.779
We really appreciate it.

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:14.019
And you know, it reminds me of what the prophet Isaiah foretolded.

00:05:14.019 --> 00:05:17.019
Isaiah 65 and 24.

00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:21.100
Even before they call, I will answer.

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:26.759
While they are yet speaking, I will hear.

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:31.800
When we think of carrying elders, our circuit overseers come to mind because they're often

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.879
a vital link between the branch and the congregation when disaster strikes.

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:42.240
And it reminds me of an experience my wife and I had back in 2010.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:48.519
I was assigned to do a shepherding visit to Haiti about 10 days after a tremendous earthquake

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:56.319
took hundreds of thousands of lives and sadly, 154 of our brothers also lost their lives.

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:01.079
Well, I met with the traveling overseers in the country and I learned that some of them

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:06.759
had lost members of their own family, but they were at the forefront of the rescue effort

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:10.680
so they hadn't had time to mourn their own loss.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.240
They were still looking for survivors of the quake.

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:16.680
So what did Jehovah say?

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.839
I will raise up shepherds who will really shepherd them.

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:24.120
None of them will be missing.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:29.920
And those shepherds in Haiti were going to make sure that none of their brothers and sisters

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.360
were missing.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.920
Do you know that our fine traveling overseers are continuing to serve congregations

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.720
as best they can during this pandemic?

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.680
How is that possible?

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.519
In this encouraging video report, Brother Paul Aichon, who's a member of the Philippine's

00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:52.079
branch committee, tells how even remote congregations are being cared for.

00:06:52.079 --> 00:06:53.079
This is interesting.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:57.319
Let's watch.

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:02.800
A circuit overseer in the Philippines wrote regarding his experience using the videoconferencing

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:08.279
app Zoom to visit two of the remotest congregations in his circuit.

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:13.399
Normal travel to these islands by small boat may take between five to eight hours, depending

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:17.920
on sea conditions and the size of waves from the Pacific Ocean.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:25.160
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, travel restrictions to Patna Nungan and Humali Islands were implemented.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:31.439
The circuit overseer and his wife prayed fervently to Jehovah, asking for possible means to still

00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:35.680
visit the congregations for the last two weeks of March.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.639
Just days later, they receive a letter from the branch office about alternative ways

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:43.319
of making congregation visits.

00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:49.399
These included the possibility of virtual visits with the use of online conferencing tools.

00:07:49.399 --> 00:07:54.279
The circuit overseer immediately informed the elders and they excitedly tested their new

00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:57.360
found means of communication.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.600
The visits were a success.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:05.439
The brothers and sisters were so thankful and really felt Jehovah's love for them.

00:08:05.439 --> 00:08:08.639
Reflecting on his experience, the circuit overseer said,

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:15.920
it is obvious that no coronavirus can prevent our Almighty God Jehovah from providing encouragement

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.839
to his servants today.

00:08:17.839 --> 00:08:23.279
We are determined more than ever to help and encourage the brothers to continue trusting

00:08:23.279 --> 00:08:25.040
in Jehovah completely.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:34.440
As mentioned in Psalm 91-2, it says, you are my refuge and my stronghold.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.759
What did we read at Jeremiah 23-4?

00:08:37.759 --> 00:08:40.480
None of them will be missing.

00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:47.240
Jehovah knows where all his sheep are and he arranges for them to be cared for, thanks Paul.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.120
And please give our warm love and greetings to our brothers in the Philippines.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.830
We love them all very much.

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:59.110
So what do we want to take away from this brief discussion?

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:00.110
Two points.

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:06.830
First, we believe that Jehovah will continue to guide his organization every step of the

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:07.830
way.

00:09:08.309 --> 00:09:12.230
And it's been faith strengthening to see how at times the organization has been won

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:17.269
or even two steps ahead of the authorities in giving direction to protect the flunk.

00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:18.750
So that's the first point.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:22.830
Jehovah will continue to direct the organization.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:29.190
Second, what is one of the means by which he will do that, by providing loving shepherds

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.070
to carry out that direction.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:37.149
And over them is the one who said, I am the fine shepherd.

00:09:37.149 --> 00:09:42.549
The fine shepherd surrenders his life in behalf of the sheep.

00:09:42.549 --> 00:09:47.389
Brothers and sisters, take good care of yourselves.

00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:49.350
Don't take chances.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:53.149
Obey the instructions of the superior authorities.

00:09:53.149 --> 00:09:58.029
We at Bethel are extremely conscientious about following the guidelines we receive.

00:09:58.029 --> 00:10:03.110
So if the authorities tell you to stay home, stay home.

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:04.870
Practice social distancing.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:09.509
Now, keep up to date with the news, but don't obsess.

00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:10.950
Don't watch it too much.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.990
It can be just too discouraging.

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:17.870
Now, what season are we in?

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.029
Memorial season.

00:10:20.029 --> 00:10:24.269
So what should be the real focus of our thoughts at this time?

00:10:24.269 --> 00:10:27.389
The incredible gift of the ransom.

00:10:27.389 --> 00:10:32.909
The love of Jehovah God, the love of Christ Jesus, those things should be the object of our

00:10:32.909 --> 00:10:34.909
thoughts.

00:10:34.909 --> 00:10:40.269
And when you feel alone or stressed out, repeat to yourself the hard cheering words that

00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:43.629
we find at Hebrews 13 and 5.

00:10:43.629 --> 00:10:50.710
I will never leave you, and I will never abandon you.

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:57.509
I will never leave you, and I will never abandon you.

00:10:57.509 --> 00:11:03.110
Be assured of our warm love and prayers.

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:08.549
