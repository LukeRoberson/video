WEBVTT

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.320
He will crush your head."

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.679
That was Jehovah speaking to the serpent, really, to Satan.

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:15.320
And God-faring people who have understood the prophecy at Genesis 315 have been hanging

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.480
on to those words for a long time, because we long to see the complete elimination of

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.359
Satan and his influence from our lives.

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.640
Can we fully imagine what life will be like once Satan and the demons are out of the picture?

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.140
How much influence do they have on us and are thinking right now?

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:44.560
If you open Watchtower Library and go to the Watchtower Publications Index 1986-2016,

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:52.799
under the subject Satan you will find a subheading entitled, Methods of Operation on Humans.

00:00:52.799 --> 00:01:00.920
It lists 56 devices that he uses to trip us up mentally, emotionally, morally, and spiritually.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.280
Like you see things in the list that you have had to contend with or are contending with

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.420
even now, discouragement, entertainment, family opposition, intimidation, personal differences,

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.359
ridicule, temptations.

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:19.879
With each of these, the index provides references to our publications where we can find helpful

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:27.000
encouragement and scriptural principles to deal with whatever is threatening us.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.319
Well, let's talk about two of Satan's methods that were in the list, starting with one

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:38.959
that was near the top of the list, convincing people of being unloved or worthless.

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:44.500
The devil would have us believe that from God's standpoint, we are unlovable and unforgivable.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.099
He wants us to worry about our past mistakes, become overly self-critical, and underestimate

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:52.980
Jehovah's compassion and forgiveness.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.819
But Satan is just taking the spotlight off himself because he is the one who is unlovable

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:01.219
in God's size and who is really unforgivable.

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.980
Now, how do we combat this method of Satan's to dishearten us?

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:12.479
Well, one thing is we can remember it is impossible for God to lie, so take to heart what

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:17.080
Jehovah has written truthfully in the Bible about his love for us.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.759
As an example, please turn to Romans chapter 8 and keep your Bibles open there, if you

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:22.759
will.

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:24.400
It's Romans chapter 8.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.639
We're going to read verses 33 and 34.

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:33.759
Who will file accusation against God's chosen ones?

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:36.599
God is the one who declares them righteous?

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.479
Who will condemn them?

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:40.280
Christ Jesus is the one who died.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.639
Yes, more than that, the one who was raised up, who was at the right hand of God and who

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:48.199
also pleads for us.

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:52.680
Now those words were addressed to spirits andointed Christians, but in principle they apply

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.919
also to those of the other sheep who are declared righteous as God's friends.

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:01.080
So do Satan's false accusations really matter?

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.240
No.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:09.120
It is Jehovah who declares true Christians righteous based on their faith in the sacrifice of Christ.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.479
And really, why would Jehovah stop loving his worshipers after he has given them the

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:19.879
most precious gift he possibly could, his own beloved son who even now pleads for us

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:20.879
with God?

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:28.639
Let's keep reading in Romans 8, continuing with verses 38 and 39.

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:33.680
For I am convinced that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor governments, nor things

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.879
now here, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creation,

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:47.240
will be able to separate us from God's love that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.439
No one, including Satan, can successfully challenge God's favorable judgment of his devoted

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:53.439
servants.

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:58.639
Now, a second thing we can do to combat this method of the devil's to dishearten us is

00:03:58.639 --> 00:03:59.639
to remember.

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.400
Satan is a malicious liar.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.199
The truth is not in him.

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:06.840
So we have to reject his lying accusations.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.960
A reference listed in the index tells of how a traveling overseer addresses this issue.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.240
He asks downhearted ones, do you believe in the Trinity?

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.920
And the discouraged one would say, of course not, realizing that's one of Satan's lies.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.879
Then the brother would ask, do you believe in Hellfire?

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:26.079
Again comes the answer, of course not.

00:04:26.079 --> 00:04:30.959
So the brother tells them there's another satanic lie that usually not recognized as such,

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:34.680
the lie that Jehovah does not love us as individuals.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.639
And that approach often gets positive results in helping the person to recognize and reject

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:45.079
Satan's lie that we are unloved or worthless in God's eyes.

00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:47.360
So we need to take Jehovah at his word.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:54.720
He is the one who tells the truth, and he wants us to believe that he loves us individually.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.399
Another method that was in that list, in the index, that Satan uses to deceive people

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:01.199
is propaganda.

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:06.519
That is false, biased, or deceptive information used to manipulate the way we think.

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:10.639
The first reference shown in the index for propaganda is an article in the watchtower

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:15.639
that we are currently studying, an article entitled, Winning the Battle for Your Mind.

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:21.000
And it begins, you are under attack, and your chief enemy Satan is using a very dangerous

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.600
weapon against you.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.600
What is it?

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.959
Propaganda, a weapon specially designed to attack, not your body, but your mind.

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:35.439
Satan can use any part of his wicked system of things to disseminate his lies, and his

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:40.959
objective is to weaken our faith and morals, disturb our contentions between us, and to

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:45.279
undermine our confidence in the leadership that God is providing us.

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:47.199
How can we resist?

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:52.639
The article says, Jesus gave this simple rule for combating propaganda.

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:56.680
Know the truth, and the truth will set you free.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.600
In the Bible, we can find all we need to combat Satan's propaganda, provided we are diligent

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.800
in carefully examining the scriptures daily, and we use our God-given abilities and

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.800
power of reason to make the truth our own.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.519
Now, the second thing we can do to combat this method of the devil is to keep in mind

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:20.279
that Satan does not want us to think clearly, or reason things out well.

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:26.240
So never be content passively to blindly accept what you hear from politicians, the

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:32.319
news media, the internet, because Satan is the master of fake news.

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:36.920
And the article concludes, have you ever watched a film in which, from your vantage point

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.600
in the audience, you can clearly see that someone is being deceived and manipulated?

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.480
Did you find yourself thinking, don't believe it, they're lying to you?

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:51.800
Imagine then the angel shouting the same message to you, don't be fooled by Satan's lies.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:58.279
Try your ears then to Satan's propaganda, listen to Jehovah, and trust in him.

00:06:58.279 --> 00:07:02.680
Now all Satanic influence will be gone when Satan is bound and hurled into the abyss

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:08.160
for a thousand years, and what a relief it will be to live in a world totally free from

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.360
his wicked influence.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.519
But then he'll be released from the abyss for a short while for a final test.

00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:18.759
What method will he use then to deceive us?

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:24.879
One of the 56 devices we saw earlier in the list, or some new diabolical trick that

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:26.120
he has thought of.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.000
Well, we don't know.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.759
But we do know that if we remember, he is the liar, and Jehovah is the truth teller,

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:36.800
we should fair just fine.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.759
Let's go back to Paul's letter to the Romans, where he echoes the first Bible prophecy

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:50.839
in Romans chapter 16 and verse 20, Romans 16, 20.

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:58.439
For his part, the God who gives peace will crush Satan under your feet shortly.

00:07:58.439 --> 00:08:03.920
Rather than being merely abyss, Satan will actually be completely annihilated.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.800
The Revelation Climax book says this is more than a superficial bruising.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:14.439
Paul here used a Greek word that means to bruise into a jelly-like state, to trample

00:08:14.439 --> 00:08:18.879
down, to destroy utterly by crushing.

00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:23.759
And the God's love book says, with Satan out of the way, you will feel relief that may

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:27.040
be hard to fathom now.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:34.039
Meanwhile, whenever wrong or negative thoughts creep into our mind, we need to reject Satan's

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:39.360
lies and focus our mind on the truths that Jehovah has taught us.
