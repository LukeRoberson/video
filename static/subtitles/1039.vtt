00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:08.820
After the Passover of 32 CE, Jesus and his disciples were in Phoenicia of Syria, north of the borders of Israel.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.820
Even in this non-Israelite territory, Jesus couldn't escape notice.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.820
Please open your Bibles to Matthew chapter 15, and you may want to put a place marker there.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.820
Matthew chapter 15, starting in verse 22,

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.820
a Greek woman, born in Phoenicia, found Jesus and begged him to heal her daughter.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.820
The verse says that the girl was cruelly demon-possessed.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.820
Well, verse 23 says that Jesus did not say a word and answer to the mother.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.820
After a while, his disciples urged him,

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.820
send her away because she keeps crying out after us.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.820
The mother was persistent.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.820
In response, Jesus explained his reason for ignoring her in verse 24.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.820
I was not sent to anyone except to the law sheep of the house of Israel.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.820
How would the woman respond?

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.819
Would Jesus seeming rejection to scourge her? Would she lose faith?

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:16.219
In the following video, look for evidence of the Phoenician woman's extraordinary faith.

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:19.219
No, I was not Jewish.

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:23.219
But I saw that this Jesus was no ordinary man.

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:28.219
I had heard about his power to help others, and my daughter was suffering.

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:35.219
I wouldn't take no for an answer. I couldn't. This man was from God.

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:38.219
There was nowhere else to turn.

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.219
I had faith in Jesus.

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:48.530
When he heard me, he said, let it happen to you as you wish.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.530
And then it did.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:02:02.319
My beautiful precious daughter was healthy and smiling again.

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.319
Because of her faith, the Phoenician woman overcame the fear of prejudice

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:09.319
that could have prevented her from approaching Jesus.

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.319
Remember, she was of Greek descent, Jesus was Jewish.

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.319
But as stated in the video, she heard reports of Jesus' power to help others,

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.319
and she realized that this man was from God.

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:28.319
Notice in verse 22, she addressed Jesus as Lord Son of David.

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.319
She publicly acknowledged that Jesus was the promised Messiah.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.319
And even though at first he didn't respond to her, and then explained his reason for doing so,

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.319
she didn't become discouraged.

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:47.819
Let's continue with the account in verse 25 to see the strong faith of this woman.

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.819
But the woman came and did obeisance to him saying,

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.819
Lord, help me.

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.819
How Jesus must have been moved by the woman's heartfelt appeal.

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.819
Apparently though, Jesus wanted to test her faith.

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.819
Like a parent who plans to grant a child's request,

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.819
but doesn't give an outward sign of that plan in order to test the child's seriousness,

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.819
notice what Jesus tells her in verse 26.

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:22.069
It is not right to take the bread of the children and throw it to the little dogs.

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:29.069
Among the Greeks and Romans, the dog was often a beloved pet that lived in its owner's house and played with the children.

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.069
The expression little dogs, or perhaps a house dog,

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:38.069
might have reminded the woman of a warm and daring picture.

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.069
By likening the Israelites to children and non-Jews to little dogs,

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.069
Jesus evidently wanted to indicate an order of priority.

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:52.069
In a household with both children and dogs, the children would be fed first.

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:59.069
So Jesus meant that he couldn't care for non-Israelites at the expense of deserving Jews.

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:06.069
Rather than take offense, the woman discerned the point of the illustration and humbly stated in verse 27,

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:13.069
yes, Lord, but really the little dogs do eat of the crumbs falling from the table of their masters.

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.069
What a beautiful response.

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:20.069
And what was the result of the woman's remarkable faith?

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:21.069
Verse 28,

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:24.069
Then Jesus replied to her,

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:30.069
Oh woman, great is your faith. Let it happen to you as you wish.

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:34.069
And her daughter was healed from that hour on.

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:39.069
The woman's faith was rewarded when Jesus healed her daughter.

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:43.069
What an example of strong faith.

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:49.069
In the following dramatization, note how someone who has just started to have a good relationship with God

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:53.069
might need to display strong faith like that of the Phoenician woman.

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:59.139
I never thought it would happen.

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:07.569
I finally found what I'd been searching for. A good relationship with God.

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:23.850
Then one day, a coworker texted an article that claimed to expose Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:34.449
I was tempted to read it and then I thought back to when I first met Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:46.300
I was so excited about what they taught me from the Bible.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:55.089
That God's name is Jehovah, the kingdom is a real government and so much more.

00:05:55.089 --> 00:06:03.540
That's what I want to learn about Jehovah's Witnesses from their enemies.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:27.620
But my friends, not so much.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:33.149
I saw people who really love one another.

00:06:33.149 --> 00:06:37.069
It's a real brotherhood.

00:06:37.069 --> 00:07:09.259
But it wasn't just the people. This was the truth.

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:19.279
I didn't need to learn about Jehovah's Witnesses from their enemies.

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:30.269
I had seen for myself that the worship to true God, Jehovah.

00:07:30.269 --> 00:07:35.269
Did you notice how the young man recognized and put faith in Jehovah's organization?

00:07:35.269 --> 00:07:40.269
That was a protection, so he wasn't misled by lies from our enemies.

00:07:40.269 --> 00:07:44.269
His faith might have reminded you of the Phoenician woman.

00:07:44.269 --> 00:07:51.269
Remember, she recognized and put faith in Jehovah's representative, his son.

00:07:51.269 --> 00:07:58.269
The question we need to consider is, how can we imitate the Phoenician woman's strong faith?

00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:05.269
Like that woman, we need to recognize Jehovah's representatives and associate with them.

00:08:05.269 --> 00:08:10.269
At Matthew 24.45, Jesus identified these representatives.

00:08:10.269 --> 00:08:17.269
He foretold that in our day, he would use the faithful and discreet slave to provide spiritual food at the proper time.

00:08:17.269 --> 00:08:24.269
Why can we have strong faith that the governing body is filling that role of the faithful and discreet slave?

00:08:24.269 --> 00:08:27.269
Consider three lines of evidence.

00:08:27.269 --> 00:08:32.269
First, there's evidence of Holy Spirit guiding these brothers.

00:08:32.269 --> 00:08:39.269
For example, Holy Spirit has helped the governing body to grasp scriptural truths not previously understood.

00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:44.269
These brothers feel as the Apostle Paul, who wrote at 1 Corinthians 2.13,

00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:53.269
these things we also speak, not with words taught by human wisdom, but with those taught by the Spirit.

00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:57.269
Second, we see evidence of angelic assistance.

00:08:57.269 --> 00:09:06.269
The governing body has the immense task of overseeing an international preaching work involving over 8 million evangelizers.

00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:16.269
The overall growth of the preaching and disciple-making work, despite fierce opposition in some lands, has been possible only with superhuman assistance.

00:09:16.269 --> 00:09:22.620
A third line of evidence is Reliance on God's Word.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:28.620
Some religions may revise teachings in order to appease beliefs and opinions of their members.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:36.620
But our dear brothers of the governing body allow their decisions to be guided by God's Word rather than popular opinion.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:43.620
We can have strong faith that Jehovah, through his son, is directing the governing body.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:49.620
And we need to remain loyal to these faithful brothers and to Jehovah's organization,

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:53.620
despite attempts by opposers to discredit them.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.620
What will be the outcome if we do?

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.620
Think back to the example of the Phoenician woman.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.620
Was she rewarded for her strong faith?

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:06.620
Yes, when her beloved daughter was healed.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:11.620
Likewise, if you display strong faith and follow the direction of our leader Jesus,

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.620
he will lead you to everlasting life.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:22.279
Well, the William Malan font, a helper to the teaching committee, will now present the next talk of this symposium.

00:10:22.279 --> 00:10:26.279
Imitate women of strong faith, Martha.
