00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:08.810
Starting in 1957, Mauritius was a branch that was looking after the Seychelles and the

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.970
island of Rodriguez.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:16.570
Recently though, Mauritius has come under the oversight of France.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.969
As we left Mauritius, the 40 members of our former Bethel family and the 10 brothers and

00:00:22.969 --> 00:00:29.449
sisters at the remote translation office in the Seychelles, they made sure to send their

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:42.560
warm Christian love to all of you here at the complexes.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:51.039
In 1956, one could read in the yearbook, Mauritius is surely one of the most isolated spots

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:55.119
on the entire surface of the globe.

00:00:55.119 --> 00:01:00.359
And when Brother Nor visited the island in the late 50s, he is reported to have said,

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.480
I have come to the end of the earth.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.120
And this is not an exaggeration because further south, there is nothing else but the south

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.120
pole.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:19.200
Yes, it is indeed a small island in the Indian Ocean a bit closer to Africa than to Australia.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.439
However, it is a very beautiful island, a slice of paradise, white beaches, palms, sapphire

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:30.400
waters and volcanic mountains.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.680
Of the 1.3 million inhabitants, half of them are Hindus, a third Christians and the rest

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.680
Muslim and other minorities.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.000
Despite differences in culture, religion and language, they have all learned to live

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.879
intolerance and peace.

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:53.760
The official languages are English and French, but most people prefer to speak Mauritian

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.760
Creole.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.680
People are polite and friendly and listen respectfully when we preach to them.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.239
But some really search for the truth.

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:07.640
Margaret started searching when she was 16.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.000
She converted from the Catholic faith to become a Muslim.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.759
But due to pressure from her parents, she also left the Muslim religion.

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:24.960
At the age of 20, she married Steve and started to search for the true religion again.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:31.039
She joined a Christian group and after only a few weeks, she was baptized in that religion.

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:39.319
She associated with members of that faith, but she says, I was drawn into alcohol and smoking.

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.560
So this made the marriage very tense.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.000
There was both verbal abuse and violence.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.520
Steve was also drinking a lot.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.120
Margaret says, we were quarreling all the time and I left Steve about 10 times and went

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.800
back to live with my parents.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.719
Our marriage was in pieces.

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:06.599
Our twin girls were afraid of us and there was hardly any communication between us.

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.680
Steve's boss at work is one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.639
He started to talk to Steve and Steve shared what he heard with Margaret.

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:19.479
He says, I wanted to meet the witnesses.

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:23.159
So it was arranged for a pioneer couple to visit us.

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:29.240
We accepted a Bible study right away and attended the meetings that same week.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.879
So what effect did the Bible study have?

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.960
Would Jehovah's help and earnest efforts?

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.599
Both of them were able to break free from their bad habits.

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.240
I fell in love with Steve again, says Margaret.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:51.560
We now have a happy family life and the children don't hesitate to approach us anymore.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.240
Steve and Margaret were baptized at the last regional convention and applied as auxiliary

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.400
pioneers right away.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.520
The twins Stella and still are baptized publishers.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.360
Seeing how the truth transformed their lives, Margaret's mother and sister-in-law started

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:14.199
to study and so did her aunt, her nieces, her cousins and even some of their neighbors

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:20.839
Steve's sister Rosie and her two daughters also accepted this study.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:27.879
And today Rosie and her two daughters Sorrella and Brigitte are unbaptized publishers.

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:35.560
The 2,185 publishers on the islands were overjoyed to welcome more than 5,000 at the memorial

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.560
this year.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:43.160
So there is good potential for further growth in one of the most isolated spots on the

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.079
entire surface of the globe.
