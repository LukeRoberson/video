00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:07.780
Thousands of our sisters have been active for many years in that large army of women.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:16.780
Bertil Coppelian, a special pioneer in West Virginia in the United States, entered the full-time service in 1958.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:22.780
In that time, she has helped more than 60 people to baptism.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:28.780
How has her outlook toward the ministry kept her going for almost 60 years?

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:45.310
My father was opposed to the truth as I was growing up, but my mother was very, very zealous.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.310
I knew that things my mother was teaching me was truth.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.310
I knew that this was what I was going to do.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.310
And it was not easy, but we did it.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:08.310
I was daddy's girl, but my mom made sure that I and my siblings knew the truth.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:16.310
She studied with us when no other children in the congregation had Bible studies at home.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:23.310
Of course, we kind of kicked and didn't like it, but it was glad she did it.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.310
My mother was a very, very positive person.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:35.310
And although she had the opposition, I saw how she dealt with it and how firm and determined she was.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.560
That was something she taught us.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.560
It's a mindset.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.560
You know, your mind is a wonderful thing.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.560
It can really influence you toward good or maybe not so good.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:59.560
And so then I was determined in my mind that I was going to serve Jova then.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.560
In our congregation, there were brothers and sisters of the anointed.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.560
They were always very kind to me, and they encouraged me.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.560
I worked in service with them, and I thought, that's the way I want to be.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.900
Children like attention.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.900
And so then if you give them attention, you talk with them and ask if you could work with them in the ministry.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.900
Then help them prepare a presentation and go over it and over.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.900
And so that they're ready for the ministry, and then they'll enjoy it more.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.900
That was one of the things that the anointed in the congregation where I was, they paid attention to me.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.900
And I loved it.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:56.169
How I learned to teach was I think about the person and I think about their situation.

00:02:56.169 --> 00:03:01.169
And I try to think in my mind what they are thinking.

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:08.169
And I work on that and think of what kind of scriptures I could find to help them.

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:17.169
And so then I try to pattern our studies to incorporate some of those things.

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:23.139
Here's always challenges.

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:28.139
Some of the winters right on the lake where I lived were very harsh.

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:38.139
And my trailer was parked in such a way that every time the wind blew and the snow came and the ice came, it sealed the door.

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:48.139
And so then I carried a big knife in my car and I would have to cut around the door to get the door to open, break the ice seal.

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.139
It was interesting.

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:56.580
I had some opposition in the territories and one was this lady was very irate.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.580
And she went to kick me and she kicked me right in the stomach.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.580
And so then anyway I dismissed myself.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.580
Then a while later it was time to work the territory again.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.580
Nobody wanted to go there and we didn't have do not calls.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.580
I don't think at that time at least there wasn't any in the territory.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.579
So then anyway I called by and I mentioned to her, oh hello there.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.579
I know I've had the opportunity to talk with you before.

00:04:23.579 --> 00:04:25.579
Yes, she remembered.

00:04:25.579 --> 00:04:28.579
And I said, well perhaps you were having a bad day then.

00:04:28.579 --> 00:04:37.730
I hit a law where I had few Bible studies and I prayed diligently to Jehovah.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:43.730
Jehovah helped me, I need Bible studies and then you have to be out there looking for them.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:49.730
And well I've lost my father, my mother, my sister, my brother.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:59.730
Well naturally you feel at a loss but Jehovah strengthened me and the friends strengthened me.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.730
I kept busy in the ministry.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:08.730
But again it goes back to that mindset, are you going to let the challenge beat you or are you going to beat the challenge?

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.490
You and Jehovah can beat the challenge.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:19.740
You know discouragement is one of Satan's biggest tools.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.740
I always tell myself I'm not going to let Satan beat me down.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.740
As far as health is concerned my everyday health is very good.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:35.139
And I have a leg that drives me crazy.

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:46.839
I think back of Jacob he serves Jehovah with a limp and then I think of Paul.

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:51.310
And so then those things keep you humble.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:58.310
I've prayed and prayed and prayed about it but just like with the Apostle Paul it didn't disappear.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:04.310
And so then I just say, patch me up till I'm again. It'll disappear then.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:12.310
If your mind is made up that this is what you're going to do, this is your life, this is what Jehovah wanted you to do.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.620
And so then you do it.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:22.019
I've seen how he's kept me going.

00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:30.019
You know that I've needed work, I've needed money, I've needed strength, I've needed companionship

00:06:30.019 --> 00:06:35.019
because a lot of times I'm in the ministry by myself, I talk to Jehovah.

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:38.019
And so then he's always there for me.

00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:45.019
I definitely want to keep pioneering or serving Jehovah the best I can.

00:06:45.019 --> 00:06:57.019
Regardless of what comes up there is nothing more joyful than to see that you have helped somebody live forever.

00:06:58.019 --> 00:07:06.230
Well how much better could it be?

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:11.230
Sister Caperian had a profound effect on those she witnessed too.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:18.230
I know this because she found me in the door-to-door ministry when I was 14 years old.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:22.230
At that age I had the goal to be a doctor.

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:28.230
One night after the meeting Bertiel said to me, well you know in the new world we won't need doctors

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.230
because Jesus will do all the healing.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:38.230
Honestly that hit me hard because I wanted to help people as well as provide for my mother.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:43.230
But she added what we will need is teachers.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.230
I thought that was a good idea.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:52.230
Still focused on a career I had one type of teacher in mind but she had another.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:08:01.230
Through her patience and reasoning she helped me to become the most important kind of teacher, a teacher of God's Word.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:06.230
Is there someone like Sister Caperian in your congregation?

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:13.230
We are grateful for the Sister Zealous Spirit and for the personal interest they show toward us.

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:17.230
And we're sure Jehovah values them like we do.
