00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.259
We will consider two questions.

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.259
What is the link between peace and courage,

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.259
and how can we help others to take courage?

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:18.260
Let's begin with reading John 16 verse 33.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
On the evening before his death,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.260
Jesus told his apostles, John 16, 33,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.260
I have said these things to you so that by means of me

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
you may have peace.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.259
In the world you will have tribulation,

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:35.259
but take courage.

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:39.259
I have conquered the world.

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:43.259
The key words are peace and courage.

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:47.259
Now, the watchtower from which our commons are taken

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:52.259
uses the same verse in connection with the ransom arrangement.

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:54.259
The article states,

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:57.259
the ransom is an expression of courage.

00:00:57.259 --> 00:01:02.259
Indeed, we can say that courage is connected to the ransom in two ways.

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:07.260
For Jesus, paying the ransom required courage.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.260
For us, receiving the ransom gives us courage.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.260
Now, before we will consider the expression take courage,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.260
let's first look at the word peace.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.260
What is the peace that we receive by means of Jesus?

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.260
Well, it's the inner calmness, the tranquility that we feel

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.260
when we perceive that we are approved and loved by Jehovah and by Jesus.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.260
And what is the reason why we have such inner peace?

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.260
It is because of the ransom arrangement.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.260
The ransom makes it possible for us to be reconciled to God,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.260
to be brought back in a relationship with Jehovah.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.260
Now, what results from having peace?

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.260
Well, look at John 14 verse 27.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.260
Earlier that same evening, Jesus told His apostles,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.259
I leave you peace, I give you my peace,

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.259
do not let your heart be troubled,

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:17.259
nor let them shrink out of fear.

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:21.259
So the peace of God that we receive by means of Jesus

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:25.259
prevents our heart from shrinking out of fear.

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:30.259
In other words, having peace will give us courage.

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:33.259
Now, to illustrate the link between peace and courage,

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:35.259
think of a flower.

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:37.259
Let's say a tulip.

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:40.259
A tulip has a bulb and a flower.

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:46.259
Let's compare the bulb with peace and the flower with courage.

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:50.259
Now, just as a tulip grows out of a bulb

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:53.259
that a gardener placed in the soil,

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:57.259
so courage grows out of inner peace

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:01.259
that Jehovah put in our heart.

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:04.259
Without a bulb, there is no flower.

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:08.259
Without inner peace, there is no godly courage.

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:13.259
So what do we need to do in order to obtain peace and courage?

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:16.259
Well, there is a saying that points in the right direction.

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:20.259
The saying is, a Bible that is falling apart

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:25.259
usually belongs to a person who is not.

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:28.259
And indeed, we need to use the Bible often.

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:29.259
We need to study it.

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:31.259
We need to meditate upon it.

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:35.259
The more we do so, the more courageous we will be.

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:39.259
Now, let's return to John 16 for 33

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:42.259
and consider the two words of our daily text.

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:44.259
Take courage.

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:47.259
What is the meaning?

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:51.259
Well, take courage has the same meaning as take heart.

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:53.259
In fact, the word heart and the word courage

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:56.259
come from the same Latin word core.

00:03:56.259 --> 00:04:02.259
So take courage means be and courage because of something.

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:04.259
Now, as you can see on the monitor,

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:07.259
the Bible records five instances

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:11.259
where Jesus used the expression take courage.

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:14.259
And speaking to a paralyzed man,

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:16.259
Jesus said, take courage.

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:20.259
And speaking to a woman who surfed from a flow of blood,

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:23.259
Jesus said, take courage.

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:25.259
And speaking to the frightened apostles

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:27.259
who saw him walking on the sea,

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:30.259
Jesus said, take courage.

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:34.259
And speaking to his apostles during the evening before his death,

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.259
Jesus said, take courage.

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:40.259
In appearing to the apostle Paul,

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:44.259
Jesus said, take courage.

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:48.259
Now, when we take a closer look at these five instances,

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:51.259
we will know that Jesus followed the pattern

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:54.259
whenever he used that expression.

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:58.259
Each time, after saying, take courage,

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:00.259
what did Jesus do?

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:02.259
He added a reason.

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:05.259
Jesus did not only give a comment,

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:09.259
but also a reason that helped his listeners to understand

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:13.259
why they could be encouraged.

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:16.259
For example, look at Acts 23-11,

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:19.259
where Jesus spoke to Paul.

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:21.259
Now, at the end of the first sentence,

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:24.259
we see the words take courage.

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:27.259
Then what is the next word that Jesus said?

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:30.259
Four, meaning four, the reason that,

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:33.259
or because, so the word four,

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:37.259
introduces the reason why Paul could take courage.

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:40.259
Thus we could read that part of the verse as follows.

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:42.259
Take courage. Why?

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:45.259
For the reason that, just as you have given a thorough witness

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:47.259
about me in Jerusalem,

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:50.259
so you must also bear witness in your own.

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:55.259
Well, the clear reason that Jesus added to his comment,

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:59.259
no doubt encouraged Paul.

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:01.259
Now, in the other instances where Jesus said,

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:06.259
take courage, the word four is implied.

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:09.259
The monitor shows the reasons that Jesus added

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:11.259
in the other instances.

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:13.259
Matthew 9-2.

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:15.259
Take courage.

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:16.259
Why?

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:18.259
Your sins are forgiven.

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:20.259
Matthew 9-22.

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:22.259
Take courage. Why?

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:25.259
Your faith has made you well.

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:27.259
Matthew 14-27.

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:29.259
Take courage. Why?

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:31.259
It is I. Do not be afraid.

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:33.259
John 16-33.

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:35.259
Take courage. Why?

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:38.259
I have conquered the world.

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:43.259
Now, how can we imitate the pattern that Jesus said?

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:46.259
When encouraging others from the platform

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:48.259
or in a private conversation,

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:51.259
we tell them not only what to do,

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:54.259
but also why they should do so.

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:56.259
We try to persuade their mind

00:06:56.259 --> 00:07:00.259
by giving reasons for their actions.

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:04.259
Now, what else do we see in the pattern that Jesus followed?

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:06.259
In encouraging others,

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:10.259
he tried not only to persuade the mind,

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:13.259
but also to move the heart.

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:17.259
We can see that in three of the examples we just considered.

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:20.259
As you see on the monitor, here is the example one.

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:23.259
Matthew 9-2.

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:26.259
Jesus did not just say, take courage,

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:28.259
but he said to the paralyzed man,

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:32.259
take courage, child.

00:07:32.259 --> 00:07:35.259
What a touching way to address that paralyzed man.

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:40.259
He must have felt secure like a child in the arms of his father.

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:45.259
No doubt Jesus' words moved the man's heart.

00:07:45.259 --> 00:07:47.259
Example 2.

00:07:47.259 --> 00:07:49.259
Matthew 9-22.

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:53.259
Jesus did not just say, take courage,

00:07:53.259 --> 00:07:57.259
but he said to the woman suffering from a flow of blood,

00:07:57.259 --> 00:08:00.259
take courage, daughter.

00:08:00.259 --> 00:08:06.259
How tenderly did Jesus treat the ailing woman by calling her daughter?

00:08:06.259 --> 00:08:10.259
It was a word of affection that Jesus had never used before

00:08:10.259 --> 00:08:12.259
when addressing a woman.

00:08:12.259 --> 00:08:17.259
No doubt Jesus' words moved the woman's heart.

00:08:17.259 --> 00:08:19.259
Example 3.

00:08:19.259 --> 00:08:21.259
The last evening before Jesus' death,

00:08:21.259 --> 00:08:25.259
he was together with his apostles in the upper room in Jerusalem.

00:08:25.259 --> 00:08:32.259
Now let's imagine what happened shortly before Jesus told them, take courage.

00:08:32.259 --> 00:08:35.259
After instituting the memorial,

00:08:35.259 --> 00:08:39.259
Jesus looked around at his 11 faithful friends.

00:08:39.259 --> 00:08:41.259
There they were.

00:08:41.259 --> 00:08:45.259
Peter, Jesus couldn't help but love him so impulsive,

00:08:45.259 --> 00:08:47.259
but so sincere.

00:08:47.259 --> 00:08:49.259
There was James and a younger brother John,

00:08:49.259 --> 00:08:51.259
one sense of thunder,

00:08:51.259 --> 00:08:53.259
but how had they changed for the better?

00:08:53.259 --> 00:08:55.259
Still zealous, but also compassionate.

00:08:55.259 --> 00:09:01.259
And there was Andrew, one of the first disciples he talked to, still going strong.

00:09:01.259 --> 00:09:05.259
As Jesus looked from face to face,

00:09:05.259 --> 00:09:09.259
a feeling of deep affection must have felt up in him.

00:09:09.259 --> 00:09:14.259
At that moment he felt so close to them that he was moved to address them in a way

00:09:14.259 --> 00:09:17.259
he had never addressed them before.

00:09:17.259 --> 00:09:21.259
He called them little children.

00:09:21.259 --> 00:09:26.259
No doubt Jesus' words moved the heart of the apostles.

00:09:26.259 --> 00:09:31.259
Shortly thereafter he told them, take courage.

00:09:31.259 --> 00:09:35.259
Now what lesson do we learn from Jesus in these three examples?

00:09:35.259 --> 00:09:40.259
As we tried to encourage others in the congregation at Bethel

00:09:40.259 --> 00:09:43.259
or in other locations where we serve,

00:09:43.259 --> 00:09:50.259
we want to convey to them our warm and sincere feelings of friendship.

00:09:50.259 --> 00:09:54.259
We want to move their heart.

00:09:54.259 --> 00:09:58.259
So what are the two main points of our brief discussion?

00:09:58.259 --> 00:10:01.259
We have challenges, we have trials,

00:10:01.259 --> 00:10:05.259
but because of having peace, we can be courageous.

00:10:06.259 --> 00:10:10.259
And when encouraging others, we try to persuade their mind

00:10:10.259 --> 00:10:12.259
and move their heart.

00:10:12.259 --> 00:10:19.259
As we tell them, take courage, my friend, for Jehovah is our helper.
