00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:07.150
Now, Jesus said as a regard to the Matthew 24 verse six as part of the last days,

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.990
there'd be wars and reports of wars.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.630
And then in verse seven, he said,

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.589
nation will rise against nation.

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:19.149
So we've seen that fulfilled in our lifetime.

00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:20.989
In a war, you have two sides.

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:24.429
They're opposing sides, aren't they?

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:28.030
And there's a different kind of war, though, that's in our text today,

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.989
and that those commenting discussed.

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.429
And we'd like to read about it in Romans chapter seven,

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:35.869
verses 22 and 23.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:40.590
You'll notice these verses are also in the watchtower summary.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.149
I'd like to read them because, listen to how Paul described this war.

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.350
It's a different kind of war, 722.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.509
I really delight in the law of God,

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:53.070
according to the man I am within.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.950
But I see in my body another law warring against the law of my mind,

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.270
and leading me captive to sin's law that is in my body.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.790
So the war going on is what he's describing.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.150
Now, I'll go over to Galatians chapter five, if you would.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.030
And let's look at Paul describing the same war,

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.390
but in a different way.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.299
It's Galatians five in verse 17, 517.

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:27.099
He says, for the flesh is against the spirit in its desire

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:32.859
and the spirit against the flesh, these are opposed to each other

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:37.180
so that you do not do the very things you want to do.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.659
So there's the two opposing sides.

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.579
One is the flesh, what's the flesh?

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.980
Well, that's the imperfect individual that we are.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.140
We get it from Adam.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.900
His sinful course has been passed down to your parents,

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.420
my parents, and to us.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.700
We are all imperfect.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.780
And so the flesh is this imperfect state that we find ourselves in.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.620
Now, what's the other side?

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.859
Well, if you notice in verse seven, it says the flesh is against the spirit

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:07.340
and its desire, the spirit.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.939
God's Holy Spirit is really a force for righteousness.

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:18.699
The sinful flesh continually warres against the positive influence

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:22.060
of God's Holy Spirit upon the spiritual man.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.979
And it's constantly putting pressure upon us

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:30.060
to give in to the works or the desires of the flesh.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.939
And what are they?

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:34.699
Well, he continues on, in Galatians five, verse 19.

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:39.099
He says, now the works of the flesh are plainly seen.

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.060
Now, it's true, isn't it?

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.699
I mean, a spiritual man, woman, we understand the works of the flesh.

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:48.379
And he describes some of them, sexual immorality and cleanness,

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:53.259
brazen conduct, idolatry, spiritism, hostility, strife, jealousy,

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:58.219
fits of anger, dissensions, division, sex, envy, drunkenness,

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:03.659
wild parties, and things like these.

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.379
And so, yes, it's a constant battle.

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:11.340
These fleshly desires that go along with this human imperfection.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.139
So the question is, how do we win the war?

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:19.500
The flesh and the spirit?

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.419
Well, one important aspect is strategy.

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:27.740
You're not going to win a war if you don't strategize.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.659
And we'll take an example of a strategy in a literal war.

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:36.539
If you go to Judges chapter six, this is the Midianites

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:39.020
fighting against the Israelites.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.740
And what was the strategy of the Midianites?

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.180
Here's one of them in verse four.

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:47.659
It was to destroy the food, get rid of their animals.

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:50.300
And verse four says they would camp against them

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.740
and ruin the produce of the land all the way to Gaza.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.979
And they left nothing for Israel to eat

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:58.780
and no sheep or bull or donkey.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.460
So that was their strategy to starve the Israelites out.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.780
Now, interestingly, what was the strategy of the Israelites?

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.539
Well, notice verse two.

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:10.780
The head of the Midian dominated over Israel

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.340
because of Midian, the Israelites

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.860
made hiding places for themselves in the mountains,

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.300
in the caves and the places difficult to approach.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.899
They went and hid.

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:24.220
What kind of strategy is that?

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.740
And Jarvis said, no, no, you're not going to win the war that way.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.379
And then, of course, we know he said he gave the correct strategy.

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:36.860
He told them what to use with the Gideon's men.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.220
And that's exactly what took place, 300 men.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.779
The large jars and horns.

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:45.019
And we know the result.

00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:49.579
It was a crushing defeat for the Midianites.

00:04:49.579 --> 00:04:53.180
So the question is this, who's going to win the war

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.779
that we are fighting?

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:58.139
The uniqueness about this war is both sides

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.220
are within ourselves.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.500
How do you strategize against yourself?

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.459
Well, as spiritual people, we have to be sure

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:13.259
that the fleshly person that we are, I am, is kept in check.

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:17.819
For example, perhaps a fleshly person

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:22.060
is attracted to someone of the opposite sex.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.500
Oh, look over there.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.100
There she is.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.019
Let's see if I can get a little bit closer.

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:31.019
What's happening?

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:33.579
Well, the fleshly man is strategizing

00:05:33.579 --> 00:05:36.939
to undermine the spiritual person.

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:39.180
Where's the spiritual person at that time?

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.060
Is he hiding someplace like the Israelites

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.300
did with the Midian?

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.660
Reminds us of David.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.939
Remember from the rooftop?

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:50.220
He was looking at his neighbor Beth Sheba.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.819
And she was bathing.

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:58.500
She was a beautiful woman that look ended in committing adultery.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.740
How should the spiritual person react

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.860
under those circumstances?

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.220
Well, he has to go on the offensive.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.060
He can't go put his head in the sand.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.579
Can't go into cave and hide.

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:16.540
See, a strategy has to be carefully thought out in advance.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.379
Now, we have an occasion of the Bible

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:20.500
that talks about the spiritual man, Joseph.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.939
And you remember, he was tempted by a part of his wife,

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:27.819
but he immediately overpowered the fleshly man

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:30.139
and said, how could I commit this great badness

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:33.819
and actually sin against God?

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:38.300
So just like Joseph, we need to keep the spiritual person

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:43.300
that we are fortified and stay alert

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.579
to the fleshly desires of the fleshly person that we are

00:06:48.579 --> 00:06:52.300
because the fleshly person is always scheming

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.740
against the spiritual man.

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:56.220
Now, back to Romans, if you would,

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.180
the sixth chapter in verses 12 and 13

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.060
because Paul further talks about this matter

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.660
and the weapons needed six verse 12, Romans,

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.939
therefore do not let sin continue to rule his king

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:14.819
and your mortal bodies so that you should obey their desires.

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:17.899
Neither go on presenting your bodies to sin

00:07:17.899 --> 00:07:20.660
as weapons of unrighteousness,

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.779
but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead,

00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:29.779
also your bodies to God as weapons of righteousness.

00:07:30.579 --> 00:07:33.980
So in this battle, what we have to do is

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.939
to identify the sinful desires that influences us.

00:07:37.939 --> 00:07:40.500
We have to go back to those works of the flesh

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.339
and identify what is the,

00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:48.339
where is the leaning of the fleshly man or woman that I am?

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.339
And then through prayer and study,

00:07:51.339 --> 00:07:54.300
be armed with the weapons of righteousness

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.939
to counteract the enemy that's dwelling within ourselves.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.620
Now, in connection with the literal wars,

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.660
while we long for the fulfillment of Isaiah 2, 4,

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.819
nation will not lift up sword against nation,

00:08:09.819 --> 00:08:13.660
neither will they learn war anymore.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.379
And when it comes to the internal war

00:08:16.379 --> 00:08:18.819
that each of us is fighting,

00:08:18.819 --> 00:08:22.339
while we long for the time when we'll all be perfect,

00:08:22.339 --> 00:08:25.339
and we can say regarding the internal battle

00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:28.220
that we've had for many, many years,

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.779
we have won the war.
