00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:10.029
Remember your grand creator in the days of your youth.

00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:17.309
That exhortation is very timely, especially for our youth today, that are surrounded

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:22.589
by a world that really ignores God.

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:28.629
Instead, they idolize people or things.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.630
They don't boldly deny the existence of God.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:39.789
They have young people in school who have science or biology teachers who point out the

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:47.270
wonders of animal life, marine life, bird life.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:56.829
But then they give credit to a mythical, nameless mother nature or evolution.

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.509
One awake magazine described how science writers write articles in which they express

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:11.189
amazement about their discovering and they use such words as miraculous, remarkable,

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:19.670
ingenious, extraordinary, perfect, a masterpiece, a great mystery, unaring, astonishing, fantastic

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.510
and unbelievable.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.950
And then say, isn't mother nature wonderful?

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:36.829
Now while our text is directed to young ones, it's good to remind ourselves to remember

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.909
our grand creator.

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.590
The January 15, 2014 Watchtower Pays 23 made this comment.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.870
Even though we may have been serving Jehovah for many years, it is good for us to stop occasionally

00:01:52.909 --> 00:02:00.349
and think appreciatively about how grand our creator is.

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:03.670
Is not life all inspiring?

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.229
The complexity of its design is beyond human understanding.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:17.229
Jehovah's provisions are so rich in variety that we have abundant possibilities for enjoying

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:18.949
life.

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:25.870
When we contemplate Jehovah's creation, we renew our appreciation for his love, wisdom

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:35.870
and power indeed, and really should not be difficult for us to continually remember our

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.710
grand creator, Jehovah.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:46.389
For example, perhaps in your room or in your house, you have gifts on display that friends

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:48.710
have given you over the years.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.949
And oh, my wife and I, we have a cabinet just filled with gifts and momentals.

00:02:53.949 --> 00:03:01.590
And when we look at each one of these things, we remember who gave it to us.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.990
Well similarly, Jehovah's creations are gifts to us.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:13.629
And every time we see one of these amazing creations, we're reminded of his greatness, his

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:20.270
majesty, how awesome he is, yes, how grand he is.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:31.150
The article series, Was It Designed, constantly amazes us at Jehovah's Creative Genius?

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.270
One young sister wrote, I love to read the feature, Was It Designed.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.830
It proves to me that evolution cannot be true.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:50.830
It's crazy to think that something as beautiful as a butterfly or a hummingbird can come

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.810
about by accident.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.689
And we say to that, Amen.

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:04.490
Our sister mentioned butterflies, and indeed these insects are among the most beautiful

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.650
of God's creations.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:12.530
Let's take a closer look at two butterflies out of the thousands of species that Jehovah's

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:13.530
created.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.079
And the first is the monarch butterfly.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:26.000
Now look at this delicate jewel, no fashion expert ever designed, such a rich color combination

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.759
as these delicate orange wings etched in black with intricately designed borders.

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:36.360
But there's more.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.800
Now imagine, the monarch butterfly has a brain that is only about the size of the tip

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.160
of a ballpoint pen.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:55.040
And yet each autumn, that butterfly has the ability and skill to migrate some 1800 miles

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.920
from Canada to a particular forest in central Mexico.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.959
They cross large lakes, rivers, and mountains.

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:11.240
And even young butterflies have never made this flight before arrive safely.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.279
How do they do it?

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:21.199
Evidently, they use the sun to help them migrate, or that is navigate, but the sun shifts

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:23.079
in the sky.

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:29.560
So it seems that Jehovah designed its minute brain with the ability to compensate for

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.040
the sun's movement.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:39.680
Well, what can the monarch butterfly remind us about our grand creator?

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:50.319
Well clearly, this masterpiece of color and design tell us clearly, Jehovah loves beauty.

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:52.480
But there's more.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.120
Think about this.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:02.199
If our grand creator took such care to give the monarch butterfly the capacity to travel

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:12.160
long distances and safely arrive at its destination, how much more is it interested in guiding

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:19.160
us, humans, in our long journey through life to the new world?

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:25.500
Let's take a look at another butterfly, the giant blue morpho.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.980
Now look at the wings of this blue morpho butterfly.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.139
They seem so fragile, don't they?

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:41.500
And it may make us wonder how could this butterfly weather a rainstorm if the moisture would

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:48.660
stick to its wings, weighing it down, making it very difficult if not impossible to fly?

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:52.779
Yet the wings stay dry.

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:54.579
Why?

00:06:54.579 --> 00:07:01.980
Although the wings look to us to the naked eye, seemed very smooth.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:07.100
If you look at them through a microscope, you'll see that the surfaces are covered with

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:15.980
minute overlapping scales that resemble tiles on the roof of a house.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:21.300
And in addition, there are very tiny grooves on the surface of these scales that cause

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:25.420
drops of water to roll off.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:32.000
Engineers, I try to copy the wings design to make water-resistant coatings for commercial

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.500
use.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:43.060
Now aside from reminding us of our grand creator's marvelous wisdom, what else could

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.899
this remind us about him?

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:54.620
If Jehovah put that much thought and detail into making the scales on the wings of this

00:07:54.620 --> 00:08:03.300
beautiful butterfly, should we ever wonder that he cares about the details of our life?

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:11.220
Has he not also spiritually equipped us to weather the figurative storms of life?

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.860
Yes.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:19.180
Not only is he a God of wisdom, but certainly above all, a God of love.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:27.980
So, we've just examined two samples of Jehovah's wisdom, knowledge, and love.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:30.500
His gifts are endless, aren't they?

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:37.340
It will take us an eternity to fully appreciate the riches of God's personality.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:43.659
This is basically what Solomon said in Ecclesiastes 311.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:48.019
He has made everything beautiful in its time.

00:08:48.019 --> 00:08:55.419
He has even put eternity in their heart, yet mankind will never find out the work that

00:08:55.419 --> 00:09:01.179
the true God has made from start to finish.

00:09:01.179 --> 00:09:11.779
And David wrote at Psalm 143.5, I eagerly ponder over or study the work of your hands.

00:09:11.779 --> 00:09:22.580
So, like David, our faithful slave has devoted a lot of research and space in our printed

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:31.940
and digital publications to the wonders of creation, such as in the series, was it designed.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:38.580
It will do us good to study these, perhaps making it a project.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:46.539
Let it fire our curiosity and our sense of wonder at Jehovah's amazing gifts to us.

00:09:46.539 --> 00:09:54.500
And as we do so, we will remember our grand creator, it will deepen our gratitude and our

00:09:54.500 --> 00:10:01.259
appreciation for him and our determination to give him our very best for as long as we

00:10:01.259 --> 00:10:01.659
live.
