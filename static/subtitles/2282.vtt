00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:16.059
When I was 14, things that happened in the past started to catch up with me emotionally,

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.859
and I felt like everything that had happened in my life was my fault.

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:24.859
I did then try to take my life.

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:32.539
When I was little, a family friend sexually abused me, and he continued to do so for

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:37.609
many years.

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:40.250
I didn't tell anyone what was going on.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.090
I didn't even tell my dad.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.329
I just tried to act normal, to block it all out.

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.770
I remember dad looked into lots of different religions growing up.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.890
Then one day, Jehovah's Witnesses knocked on our door.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.049
Their sincerity was very evident, like they were clearly interested in us as people,

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.659
and sincerely offering us to get to know Jehovah in the Bible.

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:16.540
I'm learning from the Bible that God says that He will take my right hand, that He will

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.540
fortify me, that He will really help me.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.239
It blew me away.

00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:31.200
When I went to a kingdom hall, I could feel the love and sincerity and warmth of everyone

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:39.900
in there right away, and it put me at ease.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.540
Jehovah's done so much for me personally.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:50.140
I want to help as many people benefit from that same relationship with our God.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:02:00.340
For the last 12 years, I've been doing a full-time Bible education work.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.180
Of course, my life is not perfect.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:14.129
I still struggle from time to time, especially with negative thinking and emotions.

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:20.090
Sometimes I need to get up and do something, do some physical activity.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:27.650
Sometimes when I have the memories coming back, it's like I'm watching a bad movie, and

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.669
somehow I need to change the channel.

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:41.650
I like to pray down at the beach, makes me feel very close to Jehovah.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:50.800
Coming to know Jehovah has given my life meaning and purpose.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.039
I remember learning the promise from God.

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:58.680
He says that I'm making all things new, and these things will not come up into the heart

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.610
nor they come up into the mind.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.129
I can't wait for that time, and I'm so grateful for that promise.
