00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:16.420
I grew up in the Highlands of Scotland.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.420
It was a beautiful part of the world to grow up in,

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.420
but my father, when I was growing up, you know, him and his friends,

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.420
they worked very hard, but they also drank a lot.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.420
There was a lot of violence and heavy drinking,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.420
and of course this sometimes came into home life as well.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.420
By the time I was 14, I'd started drinking,

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.420
and sometimes I fought with my father and my stepfather.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.420
I affected myself a steam and my view of myself,

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.420
and I often went to school feeling low and crushed,

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.420
but at times the teachers started to read the Bible to us.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.420
Those accounts touched me so deeply,

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.420
and it gave me real sense of hope for the future.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.420
I didn't want to be fighting and getting into trouble.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.420
I wanted to be a better person.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.310
I had a purpose. I knew there was more to life than this,

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.310
and so I joined the army.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.310
The army gave me the opportunity to get out of the environment

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.310
and to see the world.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.310
Still, at the weekends, we often ended up

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.310
in drinking too much and being violent.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.980
When I got into trouble, I always felt deep regret.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.980
I always wanted to change, so I knew that I needed to escape

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.980
from that environment and start afresh,

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.980
so I decided to move to Edinburgh.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.980
I was really doing a lot of fitness training at this time,

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.980
but really what I had done was I had replaced one addiction,

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.980
which was alcohol, with another addiction which was fitness.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.980
So I was smiling on the outside,

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.980
but I burnt out that was in a black hole where I couldn't get out.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.980
I knew that God was the only person that could help me,

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.980
and I prayed a lot during that time,

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.980
so that He would help me to find happiness and a purpose in life.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.980
A colleague came to work alongside me who had been in the Marines.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.979
We had gone to a nightclub and on the way home,

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.979
I said that I didn't like this type of environment.

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:18.979
And to my surprise, this colleague of mine started to talk to me about the Bible.

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:22.979
But after two or three hours of my questions,

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:24.979
he said, I will get my dad to speak to you.

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:26.979
His father was one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:28.979
He gave me some publications,

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:31.979
and he encouraged me to read them alongside the Bible,

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:33.979
looking up the verses in the Bible.

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:36.979
We started to study the Bible with his father.

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:39.979
We started to attend the meetings.

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:42.979
About one and a half years after we'd started,

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:47.979
both got baptized as one of Jehovah's Witnesses on the same day.

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:49.979
A few years after I got baptized,

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:52.979
I moved to Germany and during that time,

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:56.979
unfortunately I was disfellowship from the Christian congregation.

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:59.979
I went to work in the North Sea,

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:01.979
and I was so unhappy in this environment

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:04.979
that when I was not working, I was drinking a lot.

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:06.979
But if I was not careful,

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:10.979
I would end up doing myself some damage to my health.

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:12.979
So I decided to move to Italy.

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:14.979
Often when I was out riding my bike,

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:16.979
and every time I passed the kingdom hall,

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:17.979
I would ask the question,

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:20.979
how am I going to return to Jehovah?

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:21.979
I thought, well,

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:24.979
Jehovah will never want me to come back.

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:27.979
One Saturday morning, the doorbell went,

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:30.979
and sure enough, it was two of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:33.979
I knew that Jehovah had sent these two witnesses,

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:36.979
and Jehovah was saying, I still love you, you know?

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:39.979
No matter what you have done, I still love you.

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:41.979
And so for the next few months,

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:44.979
I spent a lot of time thinking about that,

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:47.979
and accepting Jehovah's love.

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:50.979
I still had some distractions in my life.

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:52.979
I was training for a race across the Alps.

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:56.979
I was still working on the oil platforms in the North Sea.

00:03:56.979 --> 00:04:00.979
I wasn't making spiritual progress.

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:03.979
One time, the elders in the kingdom hall told me

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:06.979
that there was no meeting during the week,

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:09.979
but they encouraged me to go to an assembly in Rome.

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:14.979
What really touched me the most was how clean Jehovah's people were,

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:18.980
compared to the people that had been associated in for so many years.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.670
While I was driving home, I remember there was a storm.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.670
I had all these thoughts racing through my mind.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.670
How did I manage to leave the congregation?

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.670
How did I manage to leave Jehovah?

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.670
On that journey home, I knew that I would never go back to work

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.670
on the oil platforms in the North Sea.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.670
I had a lot of free time on my hands,

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.670
so I read the Bible a lot,

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.670
and the publications from Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.670
And there was something in those publications that touched me

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.670
because it said, return to me, whole-sold.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.670
Let's set matter straight between us now.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:00.139
I spoke with the elders and told them of my intent

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:05.139
to attend all the meetings and to serve Jehovah whole-sold.

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:11.139
And after a period of time, I was reinstated in the congregation.

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:14.139
When I tried to do things my own way,

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:18.139
my life ended up out of balance, a mess.

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.139
I was so unhappy, but with Jehovah in my life,

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:25.139
it gave me more balance in my life.

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:28.139
It was about learning to accept Jehovah's love.

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.139
And when I did that, I started to make progress

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.139
because I was able to accept Jehovah's love,

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:37.139
but I was also able to accept the love

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.139
through the brothers and the congregation.

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.139
Jehovah's love is way greater than that.

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:45.139
And Jehovah's love is able to cover everything.

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:50.139
So I realized that Jehovah's wisdom is for me priceless

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:53.139
because Jehovah's the only one who can turn a negative situation

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:57.139
into something positive and give us a real sense of purpose

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:00.139
and hoppiness in our life.
