00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:06.719
There's a common saying at Bethel that the only thing that is constant is change.

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:11.839
But frankly, that's an understatement now, wouldn't you say?

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:19.839
In fact, wherever you turn, it seems like at every occasion we see change coming about in one way or another.

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:29.839
In fact, when I first submitted this outline and think back to that day, it has changed so much just in that few months,

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:35.439
it really shows we are in a time of great change.

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:40.240
Of course, we're in an organization that's built on change.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:51.439
We're in an organization that as far back as Brother Russell was willing to study God's Word and see where perhaps his belief did not align with what God's Word said and he changed.

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:57.240
And from that day forward, our organization has continued to change and aren't we glad?

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:10.239
The faithful and discrete slave continues to make adjustments where necessary for the sake of the preaching work, for the sake of Jehovah's name, and of course for his people, his sheep.

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:16.040
So when we think about that, we think it changes not always bad.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.340
Now, all changes not profound either.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:26.340
We've had many changes right here in Bethel in the last few years, changes that have benefited us as well.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.340
Perhaps maybe it's having all our Saturdays off so we can enjoy field service with a congregation and more regularly.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.239
Perhaps it's an extra day off when we turn 70.

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:43.140
So again, personal matters can be attended to field service can be enjoyed more fully by these.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.739
What a blessing even to have morning worship and our watch to our study in our room when we're sick.

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:55.340
These are nice changes. We can just go on and on about the things that we enjoy in changes.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:04.840
But sometimes, sometimes in our life, changes come about that maybe well, they cut a little deeper into our comfort zone.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.439
Isn't that true?

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:19.639
So maybe it can cause us a measure of personal anxiety, maybe it's fear of the unknown, or maybe it's just the feeling that I don't have as much control in my life anymore because of this change that's come about.

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:22.639
And so there is some anxiety that goes with that.

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:32.039
In fact, whatever the case, if we allow ourselves to become too anxious, the truth of Proverbs 12, 25 comes about where it says,

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:35.939
anxiety and a man's heart weighs it down.

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.939
And so it can actually prevent us from moving forward.

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:47.039
It can prevent us or it can slow us down sometimes if we become overwhelmed with anxious feelings about what's going on around me.

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:50.719
How am I being affected?

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:58.120
We use the example in the theme to talk about those sailors on a sailing ship.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.520
Why?

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:10.319
Well, because for a sailor, while at sea, it may seem that he's at the mercy of the elements, and it's true he cannot control the weather.

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.120
But he can adjust to the weather.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.819
An experienced sailor is able to keep control.

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:29.020
He's able to stay on course by adjusting his sails by continuing to move forward by catching the wind from different angles and allowing himself.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.620
To keep making progress.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.620
Even though at first bad weather can slow you down.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.919
In fact, for a ship to keep moving, it has to have the winds catching the sails.

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:50.919
And if you've ever seen a racing team that has raised these large sailing ships, it's amazing how they can maneuver them, how they can turn them, how fast they can go.

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.219
Because they're experienced.

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:59.319
Well, in some ways, we think we may not have complete control over our life at Bethel.

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:00.319
That's true.

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:01.919
We don't.

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:05.819
We do have changing circumstances.

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.219
But we also can keep control of our life.

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:10.819
Why?

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:11.719
Why can we say that?

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:19.519
Well, turn with me to our first scripture in the 46th Psalm in Psalm 46.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.220
Notice what it says in the very first three verses.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.120
It says, God is God is our refuge and strength.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.819
A help that is readily found in times of distress.

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:44.720
That is why we will not fear though the earth undergoes change, though the mountains topple into the depths of the sea, though the waters roar and form over, though the mountains rock on account of its turbulence.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.120
Of course, these are some pretty extreme circumstances.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.720
I'm in no way saying that's Bethel.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:05:00.319
But if we think about the amount of change, the entire earth is portrayed here is going undergoing some massive changes.

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:02.920
Mountains falling into the sea, violent oceans.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.420
And yet the psalmist said he didn't have to worry.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.620
He was in control.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.420
He had no fear.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.720
Why?

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.319
Because verse one, God is our refuge and strength.

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:16.120
A help readily found in times of distress.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.019
That is why I will not fear.

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:21.819
And the psalmist did not fear because of that.

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:24.720
Jehovah is our strength.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.019
He is our refuge and his stability.

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:32.420
The fact that he can never be shaken in his stability.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.920
It grounds us.

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:37.420
It means as long as we stick close to Jehovah,

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.120
then nothing is going to put us completely off balance.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.819
And if it does for a short period of time,

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:47.019
if we experience a little bit of rough seas,

00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:48.019
well, we adjust.

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:48.319
Why?

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:52.720
Because we have Jehovah and he helps us do that.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:06:00.220
In our discussion tonight, we're going to consider three significant changes that some have already happened.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.220
Some are affecting our family even now.

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:07.220
And others will likely affect us more even into the future.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.720
We're also going to give attention to three Bible accounts

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:16.519
that will help us to see Jehovah's unchanging love for us

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:21.019
and his ability to help us ride through any storm.

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:25.720
The first has to do with a change of location.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.319
Now, of course, I think back to January 6th, 2015,

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:30.920
and it seems like a long time ago.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.720
It is in Bethel time, it seems.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.819
It was a normal day at Bethel.

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:36.920
You made your way down to the dining room

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:42.910
for some cheese and chive egg white omelette a little musely.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.110
Then came that historic Bethel announcement

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.209
from the governing body.

00:06:47.209 --> 00:06:50.110
It adjusted what departments would be transferring to walk hell.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.610
You remember now not the computer department,

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.610
not regional design construction,

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.610
but now the service department

00:06:57.709 --> 00:07:02.509
and the branch committee office would be relocating to walk hell.

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:03.709
So think about that.

00:07:03.709 --> 00:07:06.509
How many people's lives changed

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:08.310
with just a few sentences

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.209
and a few minutes at morning worship.

00:07:11.209 --> 00:07:13.709
Of course, the regional design construction department

00:07:13.709 --> 00:07:16.209
would then be moving to Puerto Rico.

00:07:16.209 --> 00:07:18.110
Who would have thought of that?

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.509
Do you see that one coming?

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:22.509
Change can happen quickly.

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:24.610
But of course, as a result of that announcement,

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:25.709
just beginning next month,

00:07:25.709 --> 00:07:28.310
some 400 members of our family

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.610
from Patterson and Brooklyn will be moving to walk hell

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:35.410
in the beginning of large changes for all of us.

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.310
And as big as that was,

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.009
it does seem like a long time ago.

00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:42.410
Just when you were coming to grips with that,

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:45.410
then September rolled around

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.209
and you came down to breakfast.

00:07:48.209 --> 00:07:54.230
Yes, they served musely again.

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.329
But the announcement given to the Bethel family

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:01.129
that they discussed additional changes to the organization.

00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:02.930
It included a significant reduction

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.430
to Bethel families around the world

00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:11.629
and an emphasis, a re-emphasis to the preaching work

00:08:11.629 --> 00:08:13.129
and the assistance that could be given

00:08:13.129 --> 00:08:16.829
to that preaching work through this change.

00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:18.430
For the United States Bethel family,

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.529
we learned that we would not retain the tunnel complex

00:08:21.529 --> 00:08:23.730
as had been previously planned.

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:25.930
Instead, all property in Brooklyn will be sold

00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:28.329
and any remaining departments would have to fit

00:08:28.329 --> 00:08:30.829
within the property's upstate.

00:08:30.829 --> 00:08:32.830
So more movement.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.929
And that's already according to our recent update,

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:37.529
our already beginning.

00:08:37.529 --> 00:08:40.830
And we're seeing signs of that around, aren't we?

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.029
So of course, for many of us,

00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:45.529
what that meant was family worship

00:08:45.529 --> 00:08:47.529
took a little detour that week.

00:08:47.529 --> 00:08:50.230
We had to go home and talk about some of these things

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:55.029
because our families got affected by these changes.

00:08:55.029 --> 00:08:58.230
Of course, individually and as a family,

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:01.629
we do loyally comply with any direction.

00:09:01.629 --> 00:09:05.029
The organization has reasons for making adjustments

00:09:05.029 --> 00:09:08.629
and we understand that and so we want to be cooperative.

00:09:09.629 --> 00:09:11.629
But for many, it does mean a big change

00:09:11.629 --> 00:09:14.429
maybe leaving a complex that has been the one

00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:18.029
they've served at forever since they've been in Bethel.

00:09:18.029 --> 00:09:21.230
Maybe it's some where they've become very close to

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:24.230
not just friends there, but in the congregation

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.129
that they've served in for many, many years.

00:09:27.129 --> 00:09:30.529
Or consider others perhaps who have relocated

00:09:30.529 --> 00:09:33.429
their aging parents into the area of the complex

00:09:33.429 --> 00:09:35.129
they've been serving in.

00:09:35.129 --> 00:09:36.929
Now, can they move them again?

00:09:37.929 --> 00:09:40.629
Are their parents well enough to even be moved?

00:09:40.629 --> 00:09:43.230
These are real situations and we understand

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:46.629
that of course they could give us a measure of anxiety

00:09:46.629 --> 00:09:49.830
that can make us seem a little bit concerned

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.529
or maybe even overwhelm sometimes.

00:09:52.529 --> 00:09:54.529
But how can we be helped?

00:09:54.529 --> 00:09:58.730
What can we do so that we can move on?

00:09:58.730 --> 00:09:59.830
What are some ways?

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:02.830
Obviously we can't change a decision.

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:04.830
That's not our position and we don't want to.

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:08.429
We want to be cooperative with what's being done.

00:10:08.429 --> 00:10:10.529
So we're looking for ways to do that.

00:10:10.529 --> 00:10:12.429
Well, look at what the psalm has said.

00:10:12.429 --> 00:10:17.620
David's words in the 40th psalm.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:21.120
In the 40th psalm, notice what David says

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.019
the confidence he has in verse five.

00:10:25.419 --> 00:10:27.419
It says, how many things you have done,

00:10:27.419 --> 00:10:29.419
O Jehovah, my God?

00:10:29.419 --> 00:10:32.519
Your wonderful works and your thoughts toward us

00:10:32.519 --> 00:10:34.919
none can compare to you.

00:10:34.919 --> 00:10:38.120
If I were to try to tell and speak of them,

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.820
they would be too numerous to recount.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.919
So maybe it's time to personally take stock.

00:10:47.919 --> 00:10:50.919
Personally recount the saving acts

00:10:50.919 --> 00:10:54.320
that Jehovah has done toward us personally.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.620
Here at Bethel in our family.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.220
Perhaps, perhaps did he take you by the hand

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:05.120
when you were nervous about coming into Bethel

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.120
for the first day?

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.220
Maybe he helped care for you

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:13.620
when you were a new bride trying to adjust to a new city,

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.720
new congregation, marriage,

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.620
and of course a new job, a new work.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:19.620
You would do a Bethel.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.620
Can you recall when you were feeling low

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.419
when he sent not just the right person

00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:26.320
but the right person at the right time

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.820
with just the right words

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.820
to help kick you back into play a little bit

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.419
and maybe even protect you

00:11:32.419 --> 00:11:34.019
from making a mistake about leaving

00:11:34.019 --> 00:11:36.019
your Bethel service some time ago.

00:11:36.019 --> 00:11:40.019
All of us probably can recount over and over again

00:11:40.019 --> 00:11:43.620
things that Jehovah has done to show his love toward us

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.419
and his care for us, even as David was confident.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:52.019
But the question is, do you think he can do it again?

00:11:52.019 --> 00:11:53.220
He had a beautiful watch charge

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.620
just now that talked about faith.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.120
And so we think about that.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.419
Do we have that faith that he will do it again?

00:11:59.419 --> 00:12:03.220
Isaiah 591 says Jehovah's hand will not be short.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:06.320
There is nothing that cannot be accomplished

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.919
for those who are faithful to Jehovah.

00:12:09.919 --> 00:12:12.220
So we can put, we can recount it.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.120
It may be that we need to even write it down

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.419
and it may need to be that we pray about these things

00:12:16.419 --> 00:12:19.320
so that we say, yes, I see how Jehovah

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.919
has really taken care of me.

00:12:21.919 --> 00:12:24.019
Now for others, another group that's affected

00:12:24.019 --> 00:12:28.419
by that same announcement is maybe they're having

00:12:28.419 --> 00:12:33.419
a little anxiety over not moving to another complex.

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:36.519
Maybe they had their hopes set on where they were going

00:12:36.519 --> 00:12:37.820
and they were looking forward to it.

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:41.620
Of course, as all were necessarily

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.220
because they adjust themselves, they think,

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.419
okay, I'm ready.

00:12:44.419 --> 00:12:46.519
Well, now I'm not going.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.019
And it may be that the tendency would be to say,

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.419
well, why not me?

00:12:52.419 --> 00:12:54.419
Let's see, my department's going,

00:12:54.419 --> 00:12:57.720
my works is going, my friends are going,

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.720
what did I do something wrong?

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.519
And yet really, that's not the case.

00:13:04.419 --> 00:13:07.220
But circumstances and decisions have to be made.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:10.019
And so now we find ourselves,

00:13:10.019 --> 00:13:12.820
we have to examine ourselves, how am I going to react

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:16.519
to those type of feelings that come up within myself?

00:13:17.519 --> 00:13:21.320
Proverbs 13 verse 12 says,

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.720
expectation postponed makes the heart sick.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.519
But the footnote to that scripture says,

00:13:27.519 --> 00:13:30.519
where it says expectation, it says hope.

00:13:30.519 --> 00:13:33.519
And so it could be that our hopes,

00:13:33.519 --> 00:13:36.019
our expectations are not realized

00:13:36.019 --> 00:13:37.519
and can take a toll on us.

00:13:37.519 --> 00:13:38.320
It's natural.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:42.019
But the question is, will we allow it,

00:13:42.019 --> 00:13:44.820
our emotions to override our clear thinking?

00:13:45.019 --> 00:13:47.519
Will we allow it to blow us off course, so to speak,

00:13:47.519 --> 00:13:51.220
or slow us down, or even maybe change our direction

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:54.220
for a while that, well, we just don't seem to be

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.419
heading in the same direction we thought we were.

00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:58.820
We're not making as much progress as we once were.

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:04.720
To stay positive, to stay level headed, to stay on course,

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.820
requires sometimes that we give a little change

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:11.519
to our thinking, especially if the circumstances

00:14:11.519 --> 00:14:12.919
aren't going to change.

00:14:13.919 --> 00:14:16.320
It is easy to compare ourselves with others,

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.820
but it's not healthy.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.120
In Galatians 64 tells us not to compare,

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.759
it says don't compare ourselves,

00:14:22.759 --> 00:14:26.120
or our work with our fellow workers

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.679
in the truth or in the congregation.

00:14:28.679 --> 00:14:30.159
So what can we done?

00:14:30.159 --> 00:14:33.200
Well, we'd like to look at our first scriptural account

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.600
that really helps us to see the need to avoid comparing.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.320
It has to do with the, with Jesus' selection

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.120
of the 12 apostles.

00:14:42.919 --> 00:14:44.820
Think of what it meant to be with Jesus

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:47.039
at that time when he was on earth,

00:14:47.039 --> 00:14:51.639
getting to know him, working, learning from him personally,

00:14:51.639 --> 00:14:53.440
listening to him maybe day after day,

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.519
for some, what a privilege.

00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:58.000
They got to do it for three and a half years.

00:14:59.559 --> 00:15:01.600
We would trade a lot of time,

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.480
even to spend just a little bit of time

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.120
learning from Jesus directly like that, wouldn't we?

00:15:08.399 --> 00:15:11.480
Well, undoubtedly, there were many who wanted the privilege

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.240
of being one of Jesus' closest disciples and apostles,

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.840
but the time came that only 12 were chosen.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.399
We know there were many to choose from.

00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:28.580
Look at what it says and acts the first chapter in Acts 1.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.940
Notice when they were going to replace Judas,

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.340
who they chose from.

00:15:35.019 --> 00:15:37.659
So after Jesus had died and ascended to heaven,

00:15:37.659 --> 00:15:41.419
verse 21, it says this and acts the first chapter

00:15:41.419 --> 00:15:44.220
or after Jesus had died, it says this,

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.659
it is therefore necessary that of the men

00:15:46.659 --> 00:15:49.539
who accompanied us in verse 21,

00:15:49.539 --> 00:15:52.539
during all the time in which the Lord Jesus carried

00:15:52.539 --> 00:15:54.899
on his activities among us,

00:15:54.899 --> 00:15:57.740
starting with his baptism by John until the day

00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.700
he was taken up from us,

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.139
one of these men should become a witness

00:16:02.139 --> 00:16:04.460
with us of his resurrection.

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:08.899
So there were many followers.

00:16:08.899 --> 00:16:12.580
They knew who they were and they were able to select from them.

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:17.139
So imagine what it was a year and a half

00:16:17.139 --> 00:16:21.740
into Jesus' ministry after his baptism.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.340
It was time to select the 12.

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:25.740
This is what Mark 13 says in that account.

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:27.779
Mark the third chapter, sorry.

00:16:27.779 --> 00:16:34.830
In Mark 3, notice what it says in verse 13.

00:16:36.669 --> 00:16:38.669
It says of Jesus, he ascended a mountain

00:16:38.669 --> 00:16:41.509
and some in those whom he wanted and they came to him.

00:16:42.509 --> 00:16:46.669
And he formed a group of 12 whom he also named apostles,

00:16:46.669 --> 00:16:48.710
those who were to accompany him

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:51.509
and whom he would send out to preach

00:16:51.509 --> 00:16:53.990
and to have authority to expel demons.

00:16:55.029 --> 00:16:58.870
So Jesus selected from those.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:02.629
Luke's account says he prayed all night about it first

00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:06.950
and then he came down and then from the proud of his disciples

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:09.789
he selected those 12 men.

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:12.269
Now, picture yourself there.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:14.710
What if you were one of the men who

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:18.029
loyally stuck by Jesus since his baptism?

00:17:18.029 --> 00:17:22.029
Maybe like Andrew and John and Peter and James,

00:17:22.029 --> 00:17:23.910
you were an instantaneous believer too.

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:26.910
You left everything and you followed him immediately.

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:31.309
You believed and you left all things behind.

00:17:31.309 --> 00:17:35.190
But Jesus didn't select you as one of his 12.

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:37.589
How would you feel slighted, wronged?

00:17:37.589 --> 00:17:39.589
Maybe that some injustice had been done?

00:17:40.509 --> 00:17:43.029
Would you begin to discount those who were selected?

00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:44.029
No, of course not.

00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:47.990
You would think, okay, I'm not going to be one of those 12,

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:51.069
but what are the blessings I do get to enjoy?

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:54.950
What were the blessings these men would still be able

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:57.069
to enjoy and apparently from Acts?

00:17:57.069 --> 00:17:59.470
Those men remained with Jesus.

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:02.630
Those followers, those disciples stuck close to him as well.

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:08.150
Well, they still got to listen to him, teach and preach.

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:12.470
They still, if just a few days later really would be able

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:14.750
to hear that famous sermon on the Mount

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:16.750
if they had stayed right with him.

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:20.750
They were still entrusted with the privilege of the ministry.

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:24.390
In fact, Jesus sent the disciples out the 12

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:27.750
and then later sent 70 to preach.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:31.109
So many others enjoyed that blessing as well.

00:18:31.109 --> 00:18:32.990
They could help others to find the Messiah

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:36.630
and they still had the hope for the same reward

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.910
that those 12 apostles were going to have

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:43.309
being anointed and being able to be in heaven

00:18:43.309 --> 00:18:46.509
with Jesus after their resurrection.

00:18:46.509 --> 00:18:48.029
So what's the lesson?

00:18:48.029 --> 00:18:50.390
Well, rather than feeling passed over for something

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:51.789
maybe for the type of assignment

00:18:51.789 --> 00:18:54.309
or even the location of an assignment,

00:18:54.309 --> 00:18:56.470
we think about we adjust.

00:18:57.309 --> 00:18:58.549
What do I have?

00:18:58.549 --> 00:19:00.869
What are things I can enjoy?

00:19:00.869 --> 00:19:03.670
We devote ourselves, our time, our energy

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:07.269
and all our mental resources to fulfilling our ministry.

00:19:07.269 --> 00:19:08.990
What we've been given to do,

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:12.470
whether it's our work here at Bethel or in the field,

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:14.309
things we can control.

00:19:14.309 --> 00:19:15.589
Because what's the option?

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:17.710
Lower our sails.

00:19:19.109 --> 00:19:20.829
Just start floating aimlessly.

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:23.109
None of us want to do that.

00:19:23.109 --> 00:19:25.869
That's not why we came to Bethel in the first place.

00:19:25.869 --> 00:19:29.509
It's also would be a very dangerous thing to do.

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:31.829
So we avoid that.

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:36.509
Instead, we stay focused on what's most important.

00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:42.289
Turn with me to the book of 2 Corinthians,

00:19:42.289 --> 00:19:46.730
2 Corinthians and the 4th chapter.

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:49.289
Notice what it says after talking about

00:19:49.289 --> 00:19:51.210
the tribulation in verse 17,

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:54.529
that's momentary in life and light and going to pass.

00:19:54.529 --> 00:19:57.049
Notice what it says though in verse 18.

00:19:57.049 --> 00:19:59.809
While we keep our eyes not on the things seen

00:19:59.849 --> 00:20:02.250
but on the things unseen.

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:03.730
For the things seen are temporary,

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:06.089
but the things unseen are everlasting.

00:20:07.609 --> 00:20:09.210
What's the lesson for us?

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:15.049
Everything in this system except our relationship

00:20:15.049 --> 00:20:17.210
with Jehovah is temporary.

00:20:18.369 --> 00:20:21.490
Our work assignments, likely temporary.

00:20:22.329 --> 00:20:25.490
Our work locations, temporary.

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:30.279
Locations we live, probably temporary too.

00:20:30.319 --> 00:20:34.319
What doesn't change is our loyalty,

00:20:34.319 --> 00:20:37.880
our devotion and integrity to Jehovah.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.200
That's what lasts.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.839
And that's why Jehovah promises in Psalm 8411.

00:20:42.839 --> 00:20:45.480
He will not hold back anything for good

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.400
from those walking in integrity.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:53.279
You notice it didn't require a location or a job assignment.

00:20:54.319 --> 00:20:57.359
Psalm 1825 says with someone loyal you

00:20:57.359 --> 00:21:00.480
or Jehovah act in loyalty.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.240
That's Jehovah's promise to all of us.

00:21:04.359 --> 00:21:07.079
There's another group affected by those couple

00:21:07.079 --> 00:21:09.680
of announcements and that's our wives.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.519
Now our wives are often impacted in greater ways

00:21:13.519 --> 00:21:16.319
than even we are by some of these changes.

00:21:16.319 --> 00:21:20.039
Most of our dear wives pretty much they're going to move

00:21:20.039 --> 00:21:22.160
if they're husbands moving.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.759
Now stop and think about that.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.079
How could it make you feel?

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.160
What if they're moved to another complex means

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.720
losing the job that they love?

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.880
Maybe they're even good at it, right?

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.759
You know what that's like?

00:21:37.759 --> 00:21:40.599
Or even leaving those that they are enjoying working with.

00:21:40.599 --> 00:21:41.960
But now they're separating.

00:21:43.359 --> 00:21:46.480
I know for our office, our Bethel office in Brooklyn,

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.400
we're splitting into many different directions and going.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:53.079
So we're feeling very personally that movement

00:21:53.079 --> 00:21:58.079
of members of our very close family of office mates

00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.519
that we'll be moving to.

00:21:59.519 --> 00:22:00.920
But for our wives,

00:22:02.279 --> 00:22:06.000
they don't even, some of them do not yet know where they will work.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.079
They're waiting still on that.

00:22:08.079 --> 00:22:11.440
So imagine how that would make them feel and they might even wonder.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.039
Does anybody outside of my husband even understand the anxiety

00:22:15.039 --> 00:22:16.720
I'm going through?

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:17.799
Are emotions involved?

00:22:17.799 --> 00:22:19.200
Absolutely.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.880
Because often isn't it true?

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.480
We have more detail about what's going to happen to us

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.839
than sometimes even our wives do.

00:22:26.839 --> 00:22:28.440
So it is good for us to think about that.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:31.480
What can help our wives to cope with these feelings

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:34.599
and sometimes the staying balanced

00:22:34.599 --> 00:22:38.720
and staying on course with this question hanging over their head?

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:41.720
Well, we'd like to consider our second scriptural example

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.599
that of Esther.

00:22:43.599 --> 00:22:44.920
Of the women in the Bible,

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.880
Esther was one who seemed to have very little say

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.359
in how she would spend her life,

00:22:51.359 --> 00:22:53.000
but she willingly submitted.

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:58.319
Let's turn to Esther and look at this account together.

00:22:58.319 --> 00:22:59.640
In Esther, the second chapter,

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.279
we want to learn a little something about Esther first.

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.599
Esther, the second chapter, verse seven,

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.440
in the B part, in the second part it says,

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.559
the young woman was beautifully formed

00:23:12.559 --> 00:23:14.920
and attractive in appearance.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.680
And at the death of her father and her mother,

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.720
Mordecai took her as his daughter.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:24.880
So she was a beautiful young woman in Israel.

00:23:26.759 --> 00:23:31.480
So no doubt there was no shortage of nice young men

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.279
in the nation that would have been interested

00:23:33.279 --> 00:23:35.000
and she probably could have had her pick.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.319
But did she get her pick?

00:23:38.599 --> 00:23:40.000
No.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.640
She, along with other beautiful young women

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.799
in that nation were taken by a pagan king,

00:23:46.799 --> 00:23:47.920
a hazard iris.

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.880
And look what it says in chapter two, verse 12.

00:23:54.119 --> 00:23:57.359
It says, first it says, each young woman had her turn

00:23:57.359 --> 00:23:59.680
to go in to king a hazard iris

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.000
after completing the 12 month treatment

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.240
that was prescribed for the women.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.319
For this was the way they had to fulfill

00:24:06.319 --> 00:24:07.799
their beauty treatment,

00:24:07.799 --> 00:24:09.559
six months with oil of merer

00:24:09.559 --> 00:24:11.440
and six months with balsam oil

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.640
and various ointments for beauty treatment.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:18.359
Verse 14, it says, in the evening she would go in

00:24:18.359 --> 00:24:19.960
and in the morning she would return

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.559
to the second house of the women.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:28.160
So of course, instead of her getting to pick a nice young man

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:32.519
that she could raise a family with and serve Jehovah with

00:24:32.519 --> 00:24:37.519
and maybe even be someone who could produce the Messiah.

00:24:38.519 --> 00:24:42.519
That was gone because now she was with someone

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:47.839
who didn't love Jehovah, a pagan really.

00:24:47.839 --> 00:24:49.400
And he already had many wives.

00:24:50.359 --> 00:24:53.279
So that's a pretty difficult situation.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.519
Could you go along with that?

00:24:55.519 --> 00:24:58.200
Well, Esther did, why?

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.880
Well, this is what it says, even Mordecai told her,

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.960
don't tell them you're a Jew.

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.000
Now that may have gotten her out of that whole arrangement.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.200
Of course, it may have cost her her life too.

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.880
But Esther too, verse 20 says this,

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:14.720
Esther did not say anything about her relatives

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:18.359
and her people just as Mordecai had instructed.

00:25:18.359 --> 00:25:20.680
Esther continued to do what Mordecai said

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.519
just as when she was under his care.

00:25:24.359 --> 00:25:27.720
Esther put her personal preferences and comforts aside.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.720
She did just as she was told.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.720
And of course, we know what happened.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.920
Her act of faith, she became queen,

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.599
but also what really happened.

00:25:37.599 --> 00:25:40.599
Well, the fourth chapter, verse 14,

00:25:40.599 --> 00:25:42.640
Mordecai says to her in the latter part,

00:25:43.839 --> 00:25:46.599
who knows whether it is for a time like this

00:25:46.599 --> 00:25:49.559
that you have attained to your royal status.

00:25:49.559 --> 00:25:50.759
Jehovah used her.

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.759
She made herself available, her willingly complying,

00:25:54.759 --> 00:25:56.480
even in difficult circumstances

00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:01.480
that would have tested any Christian sister in our time.

00:26:02.359 --> 00:26:05.759
Surely shows that she had a beautiful,

00:26:05.759 --> 00:26:07.279
a beautiful spirit.

00:26:07.279 --> 00:26:09.119
And do you think she ever looked back

00:26:09.119 --> 00:26:10.839
and regretted that decision,

00:26:10.839 --> 00:26:12.559
whether or not her cozy little life

00:26:12.559 --> 00:26:15.559
that she wished she would have had was lost?

00:26:15.559 --> 00:26:19.680
If she did, if so, all she had to do was look around

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:23.160
and see every little boy and little girl

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:26.000
that she saw passed by and realized that she had something.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.559
Her self-sacrifice helped Jehovah

00:26:28.559 --> 00:26:32.599
in preserving that young person alive.

00:26:32.599 --> 00:26:36.079
So she was a powerful woman of faith

00:26:36.079 --> 00:26:38.119
that we can call a good example.

00:26:38.119 --> 00:26:39.880
And our sisters are no different.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:43.759
You aren't simply here at Bethel because of your husbands.

00:26:43.759 --> 00:26:47.799
You made a choice, a conscious decision to come to Bethel,

00:26:47.799 --> 00:26:50.640
to live a life of self-sacrifice

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.599
and devotion through your Bethel service.

00:26:52.599 --> 00:26:54.200
And we know that.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.200
You could have said no.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.839
When that young man was interested in you

00:26:57.839 --> 00:26:59.960
and he asked you, would you like to get married

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.920
and come to Bethel, you could have said no.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.759
He'd have followed you anywhere, right?

00:27:06.119 --> 00:27:08.839
Or you sisters who were already married

00:27:08.839 --> 00:27:10.279
and you sat down with your husband

00:27:10.279 --> 00:27:12.240
and you prayed about it and you talked about it.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.720
Can we make ourselves available

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.559
for this avenue of service?

00:27:15.559 --> 00:27:19.720
And if you'd have said no, he'd have stuck with you.

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:20.839
But you didn't.

00:27:20.839 --> 00:27:25.200
You put your own personal comforts aside to a measure

00:27:26.119 --> 00:27:29.960
so that you could have this additional avenue of service.

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.559
And you know, we often talk about

00:27:31.559 --> 00:27:34.519
telling people what we did in the new system.

00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:36.599
When we're in paradise and others ask,

00:27:36.599 --> 00:27:37.640
how did you spend your time?

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:40.319
You're not going to say, well, my husband was at Bethel

00:27:40.319 --> 00:27:41.359
so I was there.

00:27:42.839 --> 00:27:44.279
You're going to say no.

00:27:44.279 --> 00:27:46.640
I was at Bethel with my husband.

00:27:47.759 --> 00:27:49.920
And we got to serve Jehovah full time

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:53.279
in the most exciting time of the organization's history.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.200
And we've got to see beautiful things

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.519
that strengthened our faith

00:27:56.519 --> 00:28:00.119
and we got to be a part of that history.

00:28:01.039 --> 00:28:03.400
So it is for us.

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:06.720
We feel honored to serve with you sisters

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.279
that are with us, our wives.

00:28:09.279 --> 00:28:13.000
When Proverbs 31, 31 speaks, we think of you.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.079
It says, give her the reward for what she does

00:28:16.079 --> 00:28:19.920
and let her own works praise her in the city gates.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.079
Now that's just one area of change.

00:28:23.079 --> 00:28:24.440
What about a second area of change

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:25.640
that's affecting many of us?

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.599
And we want to talk about that for just a few minutes.

00:28:28.599 --> 00:28:30.799
And that's the change of assignment.

00:28:30.799 --> 00:28:33.480
We've been talking about reassignments.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.000
But more specifically, we'd like to talk to you,

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.640
brothers and sisters who have been working

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.920
as temporary workers.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.599
Some of you have your temporary volunteers

00:28:42.599 --> 00:28:44.759
who have poured your heart and soul

00:28:44.759 --> 00:28:48.279
into the walk-hill and warwick projects.

00:28:48.279 --> 00:28:49.680
And we're thankful for that.

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:54.200
Many of you have seen the project go from a pile of dirt

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.880
to a deep hole to beautiful structures.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.720
At both locations, it's been really marvelous

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:02.440
to see the willing workers.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.480
But now the projects are wrapping up.

00:29:05.599 --> 00:29:08.400
And the majority of walk-hill work will be done

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.039
in just a few months.

00:29:10.039 --> 00:29:12.160
And warwick, of course, now we got the news.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.160
Move in date of September 1st.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.880
So that's exciting.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.279
Some may have thought, well, if I just worked hard enough,

00:29:19.279 --> 00:29:22.960
if I just stayed long enough, maybe I get to stay afterwards.

00:29:24.599 --> 00:29:27.359
And can't blame you for feeling that way.

00:29:27.359 --> 00:29:30.319
But of course, it's pretty clear now,

00:29:30.319 --> 00:29:32.559
many will be going home.

00:29:32.559 --> 00:29:35.079
So of course, that's a change of assignment for you.

00:29:35.079 --> 00:29:38.000
You may be wondering what you will do next.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.319
Most likely you're wondering, though,

00:29:39.319 --> 00:29:41.480
where are you going to get the same joy?

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:44.440
Where are you going to be able to do the same fulfilling work

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.279
that you made yourself available for here?

00:29:46.279 --> 00:29:47.920
And that's really commendable.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.960
We'd like you to consider the account of Bezilell.

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.799
Now, we've talked a lot about Bezilell.

00:29:53.799 --> 00:29:56.480
Of course, during construction, we always do, right?

00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:00.839
And if you return to the account in Exodus 31,

00:30:00.839 --> 00:30:03.680
let's just look at this together for just a moment.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:08.000
And speaking about Bezilell, this is what it says about him.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.319
In verse 2 of chapter 31 of Exodus,

00:30:11.319 --> 00:30:14.000
it says, see, I have chosen Bezilell,

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.480
the son of Eury, the son of her, of the tribe of Judah.

00:30:18.559 --> 00:30:20.440
I will fill him with the spirit of God,

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.519
giving him wisdom, understanding, and knowledge

00:30:23.519 --> 00:30:26.880
of every kind of craftsmanship.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.240
In verse 6 says, moreover to a system,

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.200
I have appointed a holiab, the son of a hismac

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.160
of the tribe of Dan.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.160
And I am putting wisdom into his heart

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:37.480
and all those who are skillful

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:41.279
so that they may make everything I have commanded you.

00:30:41.279 --> 00:30:45.279
Well, that was a powerful, powerful commission

00:30:45.279 --> 00:30:47.720
by Jehovah for Bezilell.

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:50.960
He personally would be overseeing the building

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.519
of the tabernacle, but not just the tabernacle,

00:30:53.519 --> 00:30:55.359
everything that was in it.

00:30:55.359 --> 00:30:59.279
The furnishings, the utensils, the arc of the covenant,

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:04.640
the cover of the arc, the tables, the altars,

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.640
even the clothing for the priests.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.720
It's really amazing what he, as well as these other skilled

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.440
craftsmen have been able to do.

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:16.680
But in a sense, isn't that what Jehovah's spirit

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:20.240
has empowered you to do in your work at Wachill

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.799
and Warwick?

00:31:21.799 --> 00:31:25.200
You came with skills and you learned others,

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.200
like Bezilell, Jehovah's spirit has helped,

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:30.160
and it's been evident.

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.480
And no doubt Bezilell was admired and praised

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.039
for what he did, just as we admire and praise you

00:31:35.039 --> 00:31:36.200
for much of your work.

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:40.079
However, once that tabernacle was inaugurated,

00:31:40.079 --> 00:31:43.440
things changed for Bezilell.

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.480
When the tabernacle was inaugurated,

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:47.319
Bezilell could no longer enter it.

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.279
Leviticus 16 says that only Aaron could come into the most

00:31:52.279 --> 00:31:54.759
holy, and only that during the appointed time.

00:31:56.359 --> 00:31:58.400
Additionally, in Numbers 3.31,

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:02.039
it says Bezilell could no longer even touch the furnishings

00:32:02.039 --> 00:32:05.240
because now the co-affights had the sole responsibility

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.880
of moving those utensils.

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:10.720
So now, here's someone who had a personal hand

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:14.119
in doing all of that work for that tabernacle to be built.

00:32:14.119 --> 00:32:18.400
But now he couldn't go inside, couldn't touch,

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.359
couldn't even look.

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:21.960
How do you think he felt?

00:32:23.079 --> 00:32:25.200
Well, the scripture doesn't say,

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.480
but likely a man of devotion like him,

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.079
the work would have been more important

00:32:31.079 --> 00:32:33.559
than just his own personal feelings.

00:32:33.559 --> 00:32:36.799
But we know this, what he couldn't do

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:41.480
would only be overshadowed by what he could do.

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.440
He had beautiful memories,

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.839
imagine telling his children and grandchildren

00:32:45.839 --> 00:32:47.759
of what work he did.

00:32:47.759 --> 00:32:49.839
Imagine beating other, having them meet others

00:32:49.839 --> 00:32:52.279
who worked right alongside him.

00:32:52.279 --> 00:32:55.000
Yes, a lasting monument to praise Jehovah.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.720
That's what he was working on.

00:32:57.599 --> 00:32:59.920
And that's what you've been working on.

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:03.519
Something to praise Jehovah, to make his name known.

00:33:03.519 --> 00:33:07.119
But imagine how thrilled Bezilell's going to be when learn,

00:33:07.119 --> 00:33:09.039
when he learns that his faithfulness

00:33:09.039 --> 00:33:13.240
and his actions were recorded in God's work for all of us.

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.920
What a privilege that will be to.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.519
What's the lesson for us?

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:21.920
Don't judge the quality or appreciation of your work

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.920
by whether or not you get to stay.

00:33:25.279 --> 00:33:27.240
In our Bible reading this last week,

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.759
2 Chronicles 157 was cited.

00:33:30.599 --> 00:33:35.359
It says, but you be strong and do not be discouraged

00:33:35.359 --> 00:33:37.000
or do not let your hands drop down

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.359
for your activity will be rewarded.

00:33:40.359 --> 00:33:41.880
And yes, you don't need to be discouraged.

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:44.440
Like Bezilell, you have a lifetime of memories

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.680
to share and you can appreciate.

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:49.480
You'll be able to bring your family to facilities

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:50.400
that you've helped build.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.680
You'll be able to point out things that you did.

00:33:54.079 --> 00:33:57.880
You'll also have memories that no one can take away from you.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:00.680
And those will be precious as well.

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:04.240
Maybe some of those bus rides, you'll be able to talk about.

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:07.480
And I know that the audience here,

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:10.599
especially can appreciate those bus rides.

00:34:10.599 --> 00:34:11.639
Mechanics hold me once.

00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:13.800
So we're working, he was working on the air conditioning

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.400
for the bus in the middle of the night.

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:20.400
He says, you do not want a hot bus full of 60 hot workers

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:25.559
stuck in Midtown Manhattan traffic coming home.

00:34:25.559 --> 00:34:27.760
And but think of those memories.

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:29.079
Think of the things that went right.

00:34:29.079 --> 00:34:31.960
Think of the things that maybe had a little glitch.

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:35.880
Those are memories you have and every time you get together

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:37.639
with someone who you served with,

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:39.000
you're gonna talk about that.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.119
And what was the biggest frustration that you had

00:34:41.119 --> 00:34:43.239
is now going to be something you laugh about

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:45.840
and talk about for an eternity.

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:50.880
Now memories that can never ever be taken away from you.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:54.199
So remember, this is not your last assignment.

00:34:54.199 --> 00:34:56.199
We don't retire from Jehovah's service.

00:34:56.199 --> 00:34:59.000
We don't have a rocking chair somewhere on a porch

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.559
and now we're just gonna rock ourselves into the sunset.

00:35:02.519 --> 00:35:06.800
We have work to do and Jehovah wants you to be part of it.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:11.360
So it is, it's just like if you have to leave Bethel,

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.119
one of the things that someone has said before is

00:35:14.119 --> 00:35:16.239
the best way to leave Bethel is to take it with you

00:35:16.239 --> 00:35:20.239
when you go, take your memories with you,

00:35:20.239 --> 00:35:24.159
build enthusiasm and appreciation for others in Bethel.

00:35:24.159 --> 00:35:27.320
Take your friendships and never stop volunteering

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:30.840
for any assignment the organization needs.

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:34.360
They need us, they need you to do that work.

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:39.360
Finally, the third and last change we wanna talk about

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:43.360
has to do with changing circumstances personally

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:45.360
for many in our family.

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:49.360
Many of our older members of the family have served for decades.

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:53.360
They have witnessed an exciting growth in the history

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:55.360
of Jehovah's people.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:36:01.360
Maybe when Brooklyn was the only buildings at Bethel,

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.760
then kingdom farm, mountain farm, walk hill,

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:09.760
Patterson, tremendous expansion and now warwick.

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:13.280
Many of our older ones at Bethel have experienced all of that.

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:15.599
They have seen all of that come.

00:36:15.599 --> 00:36:17.880
What a beautiful privilege that they've had.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:23.519
But maybe and some have been told that they won't be going

00:36:23.519 --> 00:36:26.000
with their department to walk hill or even warwick

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.159
in some cases.

00:36:28.079 --> 00:36:30.360
So that can be pretty disappointing.

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:33.159
That can stir some pretty deep seated emotions.

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:37.199
They might feel as a psalmist did in Psalm 71.9

00:36:37.199 --> 00:36:40.559
where he said, do not cast me off in my old age,

00:36:40.559 --> 00:36:44.079
do not abandon me when my strength fails.

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:49.239
But we must remember that our changing circumstances

00:36:49.239 --> 00:36:52.199
whoever we are, wherever we serve,

00:36:52.199 --> 00:36:56.480
has nothing to do with how Jehovah views us.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:01.480
So it doesn't change our desire to be used by him as well.

00:37:02.679 --> 00:37:08.079
This last week, Brother Larson mentioned Isaiah the 46 chapter

00:37:08.079 --> 00:37:10.880
and it's an appropriate scripture for us to consider

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:13.880
when talking about this particular subject as well.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.880
Isaiah 46 in verse four.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.480
It says, until you grow old, I will be the same.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:24.880
Until your hair is gray, I will keep bearing you.

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:30.880
As I have done, I will carry you and bear you and rescue you.

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:35.679
Jehovah's always done that for us.

00:37:35.679 --> 00:37:38.000
And for you older members of the family

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.719
with many decades of faithful service,

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:45.840
you've shown us how to let Jehovah do that

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.280
so that you can get the work done.

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:51.280
It's that same unchangeable God

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:56.000
that helps us continue to be stabilized.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.599
It grounds us and it guards our heart

00:37:59.599 --> 00:38:02.960
so that we know that Jehovah loves us

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:05.079
and cherishes us personally.

00:38:06.559 --> 00:38:08.559
When our hair is gray, our strength is gone,

00:38:08.559 --> 00:38:10.039
Jehovah carries us.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.239
So we know you brothers and sisters did not come to Bethel

00:38:15.239 --> 00:38:17.719
with the idea that one day you would retire.

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.039
You have worked hard.

00:38:21.039 --> 00:38:22.320
You didn't plan for that day,

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:24.800
but Jehovah doesn't view it that way.

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:28.000
We think about Daniel in the 10th chapter.

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:33.239
Jehovah described Daniel as a very precious man.

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:37.760
He was likely around 100 years of age and yet

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:41.400
he was still very precious in Jehovah's eyes,

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:43.199
even as you are.

00:38:43.199 --> 00:38:45.559
So it's important to remember that just because we cannot do

00:38:45.559 --> 00:38:47.719
once what we once did does not mean

00:38:47.719 --> 00:38:49.559
we cannot do anything at all.

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:54.559
And we'd like to consider finally the example

00:38:54.559 --> 00:38:58.719
of the Apostle John to help us maybe get a perspective

00:38:58.719 --> 00:38:59.840
on this.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:03.079
Now of course, John was used mightily by Jehovah.

00:39:04.119 --> 00:39:07.480
He was a man of action of faith, Jesus called he

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:10.960
and his brother, the sons of thunder.

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:15.639
So they were people who were full of action.

00:39:15.639 --> 00:39:18.079
John 21 seven also says he was described

00:39:18.079 --> 00:39:20.719
as the disciple whom Jesus loved.

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:25.679
He sat directly next to Jesus at mealtimes.

00:39:26.599 --> 00:39:28.400
He was a very special friend.

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:31.320
Maybe even Jesus shared things with him

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:35.280
that he didn't with the other disciples around him.

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:40.239
He was one of the few to witness the transfiguration.

00:39:40.239 --> 00:39:42.159
He was one of the three that accompanied Jesus

00:39:42.159 --> 00:39:43.960
into the house of Jeris

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.159
to witness the resurrection of his daughter.

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:52.440
So he even had the honor of caring for Jesus' mother

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:53.519
after his death.

00:39:54.519 --> 00:39:57.000
Still after Jesus ascension to heaven,

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:00.159
when all of this activity was going on,

00:40:00.159 --> 00:40:02.840
what did John do?

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:06.000
Well, he preached.

00:40:07.199 --> 00:40:09.159
He was a faithful member of the congregation.

00:40:09.159 --> 00:40:13.280
He was with Peter when some of the most fiery speeches

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:16.599
were given, miracles were performed.

00:40:16.599 --> 00:40:18.039
When they stood up to say,

00:40:18.039 --> 00:40:20.639
we will obey God as ruler rather than men.

00:40:22.159 --> 00:40:25.119
All those things show that John was a man of faith

00:40:25.119 --> 00:40:28.320
and but a long time went by

00:40:29.719 --> 00:40:32.760
when we catch up with John later in life.

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:35.559
In the meantime, so much else had happened.

00:40:35.559 --> 00:40:37.599
Many had written their own gospels, right?

00:40:37.599 --> 00:40:41.920
Matthew had written it some eight years after Jesus' death.

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:45.599
15 to 17 years later, Luke wrote his,

00:40:45.599 --> 00:40:48.599
a few years after that, Mark wrote his, but not John,

00:40:48.599 --> 00:40:50.840
still hadn't written his.

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:54.480
63 years later, where do we find John?

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:56.960
Well, apparently where most Christians were back then,

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:59.559
preaching or in prison.

00:40:59.559 --> 00:41:04.090
So look at what it says, Revelation 1.9,

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:05.769
Revelation 1.9.

00:41:05.769 --> 00:41:08.010
Now imagine he's old.

00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:10.610
He's well into his nineties.

00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:14.730
He's the last of the apostles to be alive.

00:41:15.889 --> 00:41:17.210
Revelation 1.9 says,

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:18.449
I, John your brother,

00:41:18.449 --> 00:41:21.650
and I share with you in the tribulation and kingdom

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:25.130
and endurance in association with Jesus

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:29.090
was on the island called Patmos for speaking about God

00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:33.480
and bearing witness concerning Jesus.

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:37.039
John was old, but he was active.

00:41:37.039 --> 00:41:41.400
His faith was intact and he found himself

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:46.400
in prison, but that's not even fully the point.

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:50.400
You see, John was yet to receive,

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:53.079
was just about to receive or had just received,

00:41:53.079 --> 00:41:58.079
what was arguably the greatest privilege he would ever have.

00:41:58.599 --> 00:42:02.239
Yes, because Jehovah caused him to see a thrilling vision

00:42:02.239 --> 00:42:04.880
of the future and brings it all the way down

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:07.000
to the time of the end and the conclusion

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.440
of this system of things.

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:13.400
He got to pen the vision of Revelation.

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:18.039
And then after that, he got to write his gospel

00:42:18.039 --> 00:42:20.840
and three other books with his name.

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.320
Do you think he was worthless?

00:42:24.039 --> 00:42:26.199
No, he was at an all-time peak.

00:42:26.199 --> 00:42:31.199
His value was the best ever, but isn't it amazing?

00:42:31.559 --> 00:42:34.039
We think sometimes that maybe there's nothing left

00:42:34.039 --> 00:42:37.800
for us to do, but that's not how Jehovah sees it.

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:39.400
We've got a grand privilege for John

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:42.000
to cap some 70 years of faithful service.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:42.960
What's the lesson?

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:47.239
We never lose our value to Jehovah or his organization

00:42:47.239 --> 00:42:49.239
as long as we remain faithful.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.519
And it's true that for our older ones here at Bethel,

00:42:52.519 --> 00:42:57.280
you've taught us as young ones coming into Bethel.

00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:59.559
What it means to work for Jehovah,

00:42:59.559 --> 00:43:02.360
what it means to really put yourself out for that.

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:05.280
The example I always think of is when it snows outside

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.679
in Brooklyn, and we have a nice arrangement.

00:43:07.679 --> 00:43:10.000
The transportation office will go out.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.280
They'll actually see if the roads can be traveled.

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:13.920
They'll call the Bethel office.

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.920
Bethel office will call the branch committee.

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:17.440
We'll put an announcement together.

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.679
It's too snowy to go out.

00:43:18.679 --> 00:43:20.400
You know what we spend the most time on?

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.960
Trying to figure out how to tell the senior members

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:28.500
of the family, it's okay not to go to work.

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:33.980
You would think we're trying to make them renounce their faith.

00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:37.300
And don't let those sidewalks dry up before noon

00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:38.980
because they'll be out there.

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:40.980
They'll be going to work.

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:45.099
Yes, you have taught us how to be

00:43:45.099 --> 00:43:47.420
really devoted servants of Jehovah.

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:48.860
And you will continue to do that.

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:53.980
Your example is one that comes like a tree that has maturity.

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:57.340
It's so much more valuable than just a sapling

00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:59.179
that is waiting to produce fruitage.

00:44:00.219 --> 00:44:02.219
So it is that we know you're like big trees

00:44:02.219 --> 00:44:04.059
of righteousness to Jehovah.

00:44:05.659 --> 00:44:08.820
So these are areas that all of us face

00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:11.820
these we haven't covered them all.

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:14.820
It's just a few we've considered tonight.

00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:17.820
But we recognize that change is a fact of life

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:19.820
and we're all affected by it.

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:20.820
It's going to continue.

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:22.820
We expect it to.

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:25.820
But we've all learned that the one thing

00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:27.820
that doesn't change is Jehovah.

00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:29.820
He's the one who will keep us.

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:31.820
He's the one who will ground us

00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:33.820
and he is our refuge and our strength.

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:35.820
And our Bible examples today.

00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:37.820
Do we have one that can help us?

00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:40.820
Bezile and Esther in the Apostle John

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:42.820
and their faithful examples.

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:48.099
When we go back to our illustration of sailing,

00:44:48.099 --> 00:44:52.099
rarely is a boat able to get somewhere sailing

00:44:52.099 --> 00:44:53.099
in a direct line.

00:44:53.099 --> 00:44:55.099
Now sometimes you'll have great weather

00:44:55.099 --> 00:44:56.099
and that can happen.

00:44:56.099 --> 00:44:58.099
But when sailing into the wind,

00:44:58.099 --> 00:45:02.099
a sailor needs to employ what they call tacking.

00:45:02.099 --> 00:45:03.099
And the organization has used that

00:45:03.099 --> 00:45:06.099
in talking about maneuvering and changes.

00:45:06.099 --> 00:45:09.099
But in short, it means that they steer upwind

00:45:09.099 --> 00:45:11.099
in a zigzag fashion

00:45:11.099 --> 00:45:14.099
so that they get the wind hitting both sides of the sail

00:45:14.099 --> 00:45:15.099
and it pushes them forward

00:45:15.099 --> 00:45:20.099
in spite of riding into the wind.

00:45:20.099 --> 00:45:24.099
For us, we have the advantage Jesus is at the helm.

00:45:24.099 --> 00:45:28.099
He knows exactly where he wants us to be going.

00:45:28.099 --> 00:45:32.099
We're not alone in going through changes at Bethel either.

00:45:32.099 --> 00:45:35.099
First Corinthians 1225 tells us

00:45:35.099 --> 00:45:39.099
there should be no division in the body.

00:45:39.099 --> 00:45:42.099
But its members should have mutual concern for one another.

00:45:42.099 --> 00:45:45.099
So our concern for others should help us

00:45:45.099 --> 00:45:47.099
to not just think about ourselves.

00:45:47.099 --> 00:45:50.099
We have many who are changing assignments

00:45:50.099 --> 00:45:53.099
even now, temporary workers who are leaving.

00:45:53.099 --> 00:45:55.099
Bethel family members being reassigned

00:45:55.099 --> 00:45:58.099
and others who will be moving very soon.

00:45:58.099 --> 00:46:01.099
These are changes and they affect us.

00:46:01.099 --> 00:46:04.099
But Jehovah is that same person.

00:46:04.099 --> 00:46:07.099
Even as we read in the 46th Psalm,

00:46:07.099 --> 00:46:12.099
the one who can be with us no matter what.

00:46:12.099 --> 00:46:15.099
Bigger, more exciting changes.

00:46:15.099 --> 00:46:18.099
I appreciate Brother Let's saying that even

00:46:18.099 --> 00:46:21.099
in his watchtower study today,

00:46:21.099 --> 00:46:23.099
Armageddon is coming.

00:46:23.099 --> 00:46:26.409
Is it getting bigger than that?

00:46:26.409 --> 00:46:29.409
Wickedness will be a thing of the past.

00:46:29.409 --> 00:46:31.409
Paradise will be real.

00:46:32.409 --> 00:46:37.409
And here the resurrection will happen.

00:46:37.409 --> 00:46:40.409
An old age and death will be a thing of the past.

00:46:40.409 --> 00:46:45.409
These are changes we can believe in and we can look forward to.

00:46:45.409 --> 00:46:47.880
When we think about that,

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:49.880
whatever changes come our way,

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:53.880
we can be confident that we will not just go through them,

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.880
but we can actually embrace them.

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:58.880
We can even grow from them.

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:01.880
We can even make sure we're moving ahead with them.

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:06.880
We can be sure that our unchanging God Jehovah

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:11.880
will stick by us and he's our rewarder everlastingly.
