00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:24.739
My name is Mickey.

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:28.219
I moved here one year ago.

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:38.700
Everyone was so nice and friendly.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:57.640
Well, that's how I felt in the beginning.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:07.180
Not your babysitter.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:20.909
Didn't you see we were talking?

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.069
Come on!

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:25.480
This is not a park!

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.079
And the elders are always busy.

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:42.549
I'm not sure if they really want me here.

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:48.870
Yoko, a pioneer sister from my former congregation visited me.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.489
She asked me how I was doing.

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:57.769
I told her how I feel about my congregation.

00:01:57.769 --> 00:02:02.489
Then she told me that she had a similar experience.

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:07.590
And she shared with me a watchtower article that helped her.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.449
I made this my next personal study project.

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:18.090
What do you see when you look at others?

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.180
Do you have the tendency to view what they say or do as either black or white?

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.030
As if no other colors or shades existed?

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.909
Having that viewpoint would be like a photographer who ignores the large variety of brilliant

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:38.110
hues and shades in an autumn landscape.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:48.479
As if only black and white images existed.

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:54.000
Maybe I've been viewing the congregation as black and white.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.060
The article then turned my attention to Jesus' example.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:09.759
The spirit of course is eager, but the flesh is weak.

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:25.030
Why was Jesus able to say such kind words to his disciples?

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.150
Insight is the ability to put yourself in the others place.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.590
Jesus did that with his disciples.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.590
Okay, I need to do the same.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.909
She always looks after the children at home.

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:44.389
She also needs time to be refreshed by association with friends at the kingdom hall.

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:47.789
She probably didn't mean to be rude.

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:52.669
Since we looked like we were having an enjoyable conversation, she may have just wanted to

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:55.270
join us.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.430
The elders are so busy caring for the needs of the congregation.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.030
I know they're doing the best they can.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.189
I want to do what I can to make their job easier.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:36.220
You are such a beautiful Christian.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:45.980
We're so glad to have you in our congregation.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.620
The inside of a man certainly slows down his anger.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.819
And it is beauty on his part to overlook an offense.
