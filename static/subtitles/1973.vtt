00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:25.050
I always say that we should be grateful to those that have introduced us.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:32.770
In this case, Jehovah's Witnesses to bloodless surgery, because by means of the ongoing work

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:39.570
on patients that have refused transfusions over the past 30 years, we have gained truly

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.329
valuable information.

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:49.490
The first is that blood transfusions are associated with not altogether positive

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.200
outcome.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.840
The second is that, with a well thought out approach and with targeted strategies, it

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:15.379
is possible to perform even major surgeries without transfusing halogenic blood.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:23.579
Well, I've been a doctor for 25 years, so I have witnessed various forms of progress.

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:31.299
The first thing I can say is that the concept of non-pharmacological therapies has evolved.

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:37.099
For example, the use of machines to recycle intraoperative blood.

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:43.060
Techniques of preoperative normal valima chema dilution have been developed.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:50.980
There is medicine that reduces bleeding, but above all, surgery has evolved.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.659
I witnessed the birth, so to say, of laparoscopic surgery, which is an operative technique that

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:04.260
enables major surgeries with minimal, even zero blood loss.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:10.979
So we should thank surgical technologies and developments in anesthesiology.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:26.379
For the steady decrease in intraoperative bleeding, we have seen over the years.

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:32.020
I would say the doctor has the absolute duty to respect the patient's will.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.900
Also because the patient's rightful consent is the only act that authorizes the doctor

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:51.050
surgeon to operate on him, otherwise he would be guilty of an assault.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:57.210
According to my experience, and what is clear according to international literature,

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:05.210
at least 80% to 90% of all elective surgeries can safely be performed without halogenic blood.
