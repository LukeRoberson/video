00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:07.150
This morning, we're discussing this illustration that Jesus gave concerning the unrighteous

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.150
Jewel.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.390
Of course, it's founded in Luke chapter 16, verses 1 through 8.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.989
What is the real lesson behind this illustration that Jesus gave?

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:23.870
Well, it's interesting to note that many people get distracted even before they find out

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.870
what the lesson is.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:26.870
How is that so?

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:32.670
Well, when the reading the scriptures and read chapter 15 of Luke, they see what has

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:38.229
been described one of the most powerful illustrations Jesus ever gave, that of the so-called

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:41.469
Particle Son or the Wasteful Son.

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:46.390
And then, as they read on, they come to this illustration, which has been described

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.189
as one of the most puzzling illustrations Jesus gave.

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:55.750
Why are so many people concerned or puzzled by this illustration?

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:05.269
Well, some people feel that Jesus is supporting and condoning dishonest use of funds.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.670
But is that really the case?

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.950
Should we get distracted wondering why Jesus used this illustration?

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.909
Well, as Bible students, it's always good for us to see what the Bible says.

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.590
So let's take our Bibles and turn together to Luke chapter 16, and then rather than

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.150
having a preconceived idea, let's see what Jesus actually said as recorded here in Luke 16.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.590
Reading verse 1, it says, then he also said to the disciples,

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.310
a rich man had a steward who was accused of handling his goods wastefully.

00:01:42.989 --> 00:01:44.269
Now, here's the first question.

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:52.510
We notice this man, Jesus doesn't say he was found condemned or he was actually doing something

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.750
that had been proven to be wrong, but he mentions here he was accused.

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:05.150
The Watchtower made the interesting comment that this doesn't necessarily mean to say he did

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.110
something wrong, but he was accused of it.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.909
In fact, the Greek that was used here to record this illustration allows for the fact that perhaps

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:16.349
he could have been slandered.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.150
And what was he accused of?

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:26.590
Well, notice the last word there in verse 1 of handling his goods wastefully.

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:33.389
So he wasn't accused of stealing, but using things wastefully.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:41.310
It's interesting to note that the word used here for wastefully is the same word that's used

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:47.789
in the previous illustration of the Particle Sun in chapter 15, verse 13, where it speaks of

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:55.229
the Particle squandering the inheritance. Now, in that case, the Particle or the wasteful

00:02:55.229 --> 00:03:01.469
Sun didn't steal the money from his father, did he? He received it in a legal way,

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:03.870
but then the point was he squandered it.

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:12.669
So likewise here we see that this steward was accused of wastefully using what was the masters.

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:17.710
Well, let's consider what he was told in verse 2.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.229
So he called him and said, what is this I hear about you?

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.469
Hand in the account of your stewardship, for you can no longer manage the house.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:37.629
So what did the master say to the steward? Did he say to him, you're going to prison?

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:44.830
Are we going to have a court case? No. In fact, he didn't even immediately remove him from that

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:50.430
position of authority, but what did he say to him? You need to hand in the account.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.550
So in other words, the manager didn't really know what the steward was doing,

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.870
but he allowed him the opportunity now to hand in this account.

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:07.550
So when we look at the background of what actually was said here, and we think of it from

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:14.110
the viewpoint of those who listened to Jesus, it seems that what the steward had done and then

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:21.550
when proceeded to do was actually legitimate and legal. He was concerned about his future.

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:26.670
If he knew that he had to hand in an account that would result in him going to prison,

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.829
then certainly he probably wouldn't have acted the way that he did.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:39.629
But this raises some questions, doesn't it? Perhaps we might think, well, he went ahead and reduced

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:47.790
the debts of various ones. Wasn't that the wrong thing to do? Well, to get the true understanding of

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.550
this, it's good for us to take note of what the watchtower, the November watchtower this year,

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:00.509
and in the section that says, did you know, it tells us there what was involved with a steward's

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:09.149
responsibility. In biblical times, apparently a steward could be the manager or the one who ran a

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:18.509
household or an estate. Often times the owner would just leave everything completely to the steward

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:23.949
to care for. All he was interested in was the final results. Would he get a profit or not?

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.709
Now, it's interesting that in this watchtower article, it mentions the case of Joseph,

00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:35.389
and what do we remember from what Genesis 39 tells us? It says that,

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:42.829
Portofa let left everything in Joseph's control, and he had no thought of anything except the

00:05:42.829 --> 00:05:48.910
food that he was receiving. So here we have a situation where this steward is a manager of an estate,

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:54.910
the master really isn't concerned with all the details of what's happening, at least up to this

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:03.629
point, and he still has authority. So those that were listening to Jesus, what may they have

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:10.350
thought about? Well, we don't know for sure, but perhaps they may have thought of this steward

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:19.069
reducing the interest rate, or perhaps he reduced his personal commission that was originally

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:26.750
put on these loans, or perhaps originally in his enthusiasm, he overcharged them, and now he was

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:34.430
reducing it down to the normal price. Whatever the case, we know that a steward who is a manager,

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:40.750
like many managers today, have the right to write off certain debts completely, and even forgive

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:49.310
certain debts. So obviously, then, as the watchtower has pointed out, this steward still had full control,

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:56.110
and had the responsibility and the authority to be able to make whatever changes he saw fit.

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:05.629
So that begs the question, was he dishonest? Well, when we read a number of versions of the Bible

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:13.389
in English, they actually say the dishonest steward, and they use the term dishonest. But let's

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:18.990
have a look and see again what the Bible actually says. The New World Transition very accurately

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:26.430
translates it this way in verse 8, and his master commended the steward, though unrighteous,

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:32.269
you see, he doesn't say dishonest, doesn't say he was a thief, although unrighteous because

00:07:32.269 --> 00:07:41.310
he acted with practical wisdom. So when we think of this, the steward didn't do the right thing,

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:46.110
that's what unrighteous means, it's a very broad statement, and what would have been the right thing

00:07:46.829 --> 00:07:51.790
to do things for the master. But in this case, he was doing something for himself.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:58.189
Now, some Bible translators have tried to capture that thought. Let me read you one example.

00:07:59.149 --> 00:08:06.750
It says, his boss acknowledged that the business manager who had permitted the invoices to be changed

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:16.670
had acted cleverly in his own selfish interest. Do we know exactly all the details behind what Jesus

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:22.750
was saying? No. But what does this help us to see? Don't jump to conclusions. Read what the

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:28.350
Scripture says, and don't get distracted by details that could take away from the beautiful

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:33.870
lesson that we should gain. And what is the lesson? Jesus tells us, let's look in verse 9.

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:42.190
Also, I say to you, make friends for yourselves by means of the unrighteous riches, so that when such fail,

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:49.470
they may receive you into the everlasting dwelling places. What's the lesson? We need to use our

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:55.549
assets, our material assets, in a way that makes friends with Jehovah and Jesus that results in

00:08:55.549 --> 00:09:01.710
something good. And we notice there in verse 9, it says, when these fail, it doesn't say if,

00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:08.669
and we realize is Jehovah's servants that eventually the commercial systems of this world

00:09:08.669 --> 00:09:14.669
will fail. Whatever money we have, whatever assets we have, it's just like this to it. They don't

00:09:14.669 --> 00:09:20.269
really belong to us, and soon we're not going to have them to use. So surely, we would want to use

00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:26.830
them to Jehovah's praise and to make friends with Jehovah. So what assets do better lights have?

00:09:26.909 --> 00:09:33.549
Well, we have our own personal assets, few as they may be, but also we make use of the assets

00:09:33.549 --> 00:09:40.590
of the organization. Remember, we may not be tempted to be dishonest with those assets,

00:09:41.309 --> 00:09:48.750
but could we be wasteful with those assets? Well, that brings us to the final thought in verse 10,

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:54.909
where Jesus said, the person faithful in what is least, that is with regard to material things and

00:09:54.909 --> 00:10:02.269
assets, is faithful also in much. And the person unrighteous in what is least is unrighteous also

00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:10.990
in much. What's the lesson? Don't get distracted by details, step back and see what is the illustration

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:17.470
telling us. And in this case, a beautiful reminder that we should use whatever we have to Jehovah's glory.
