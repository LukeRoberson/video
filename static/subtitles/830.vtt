00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:12.679
In four of his letters, the Apostle Paul encouraged fellow Christians to greet one another with a holy kiss.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:19.679
Similarly, Peter used the expression, greet one another with a kiss of love.

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:23.679
Now, why was that encouragement given?

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:30.679
Because giving a kiss was a token of affection, honor or peace.

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:35.679
Well, in a similar vein, notice what Jehovah commands us to do.

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:38.679
In Psalm 2, please.

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:43.679
Go to the second Psalm and let's read verse 12.

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:50.679
Jehovah says, honor or, if you look at the footnote, literally, kiss.

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:58.679
Kiss the son or God will become indignant and you will perish from the way.

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:04.680
For his, Jehovah's anger flares up quickly.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.680
You notice, Jehovah doesn't present this as an option, does he?

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.680
He didn't say, I recommend, I suggest you kiss my son.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.680
It's actually presented as a decree, a powerful statement indeed.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.680
And Jehovah takes it very personal, whether we warmly, affectionately welcome his son,

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.680
or not, see.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:40.680
Those who do not do so, do not kiss the son warmly welcome him will perish as result of Jehovah's anger.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.680
Or put another way, such ones will meet God.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.680
Now, let's talk about this just for a little bit.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.680
The Israelites, because they were so disobedient, were warned by Jehovah through Amos,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:04.680
the prophet at Amos 4-12, get ready to meet your God.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.680
Now, that expression reminds me when I was a young teenager growing up in the southern part of the United States,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.680
along the highways we would often see religious billboards.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.680
And a common sign read, are you ready to meet God?

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.680
And it was supposed to be based on Amos 4-12.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.680
We ask, and it was explained to us, that the meaning was, are you ready to go to heaven,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.680
meet God face to face, and thereafter live in heaven.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.680
The word meet was being used with a favorable connotation.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.680
But as we indicated, that's not the meaning of Amos 4-12.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:53.680
Not to get ready to introduce yourself to God in a friendly way, far from it.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.680
Jehovah through Amos was warning those disobedient Israelites,

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.680
they were going to meet God by means of a head-on collision.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.680
It was going to be similar to a little ant walking in a train rail walking south,

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.680
being met by a locomotive coming north.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.680
That's what the Israelites would experience.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.680
And sure enough, as Jehovah warned, some years later,

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.680
the Israelites met God when they received His adverse judgment

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.680
when a Syria conquered and devastated them.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.680
But here's a question, what get ready to meet your God message

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.680
is being sounded by God's people today?

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.680
Well, it's true, we sound the good news of the kingdom.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.680
But we also sound a warning message, don't we?

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.680
We warn that all who do not take a stand with Jehovah and walk with Him

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.680
but continue to walk in opposition will meet Him in a head-on collision.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.680
But here's another question, what will happen in the near future

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.680
and we've learned during the Great Tribulation to the tone,

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.680
the tenor of our get ready to meet your God warning message?

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.680
Well, for the answer, let's go to Revelation chapter 16.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.680
Revelation chapter 16, and please, let's read verse 21,

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.930
then, great hailstones, each about the weight of a talent,

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.930
fell from heaven on the people and the people blaspheme God

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:45.930
because of the plague of hell for the plague was unusually great.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.930
Well, our publications have explained that, of course, right now,

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.930
we take the soft waters of truth to people encouraging them to turn to Jehovah.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:03.930
But soon, during the Great Tribulation, the tone, the tenor, will turn hard.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.930
It will announce the imminent end of Satan's entire wicked system.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:19.930
The soft waters of truth will congeal to become the hard-hitting hailstones of truth.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.930
And this message will be so powerful that, as indicated there in that scripture,

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.930
we read that the people will blaspheme God.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.930
They will be very upset, they will be very disturbed,

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:38.930
and it's likened to a great hailstone with every hailstone,

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:45.930
a great hailstorm, I should say, with every hailstone weighing about a talent.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:51.930
Now, the Revelation climax book said, if the Apostle John had in mind the Greek talent,

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.930
that would mean each hailstone would weigh about 45 pounds.

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:02.930
Some years ago, interestingly, there was a little article or a little account in the watchtower

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:12.930
about egg-sized hail, falling in China and killing 25 people and wounding 200 additional people.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.930
Now, think about it, if hailstones weighing only ounces could do that,

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.930
what about 45 pound hailstones?

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:29.930
And especially if you factor in how fast they fall, experts say a large hailstone

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:36.930
can fall at speeds faster than 100 miles an hour.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:42.930
And interestingly, not long ago, the watchtower made the comment that it could well be

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:50.930
that our hailstone message that we're commissioned to give will be what induces God of May,

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:58.930
to make his all-out attack against Jehovah's people with the intention of wiping them from the earth.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:05.930
And of course, we know the attack of God is the event that will enrage Jehovah

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:11.930
and move him to bring on the rescue operation of Armageddon.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:18.930
But right now, we're still in the Kiss God Sun invitation time period.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.930
We're happy about that, right?

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.930
But don't get too comfortable with that message either.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:35.930
But we entreat honest-hearted ones to honor God's Sun, to warmly welcome him as Earth's new ruler.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.930
And we do this urgently, don't we?

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:46.930
During the time before that hard-hitting get ready to meet your God time period arrives.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.930
But now, here's a very important question.

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:54.930
Are we motivated to kiss God's Sun only because we don't want to experience

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:58.930
the adverse consequences of not doing so?

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.930
No.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:04.930
Our main motivator is love, isn't it?

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:13.930
We love Jehovah, and we love his dear Son, and we long for him to be Earth's new ruler.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:19.930
That love is what mainly motivates us to do so, to kiss, welcome God's Sun.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:23.930
And of course, we want to help honest-hearted ones as we teach them,

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:29.930
to likewise kiss God's Sun because they are motivated by love.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.929
But Jesus is Jehovah's choice, isn't he?

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:39.929
Jehovah has selected him, has installed him as King of the Kingdom.

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:45.929
And he will be the absolute best ruler that humans could ever have.

00:08:45.929 --> 00:08:49.929
Why? What will make Jesus the very best ruler?

00:08:49.929 --> 00:08:54.929
Well, one thing, he will have superhuman abilities.

00:08:54.929 --> 00:08:58.929
And he will demonstrate, he will have these during his thousand year reign,

00:08:58.929 --> 00:09:03.929
it will make him a wonderful, very loving ruler.

00:09:03.929 --> 00:09:10.929
In fact, let's identify six superhuman abilities that Jesus will possess and demonstrate

00:09:10.929 --> 00:09:14.929
during his wonderful thousand year reign.

00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:18.929
And to identify each of these six superhuman abilities,

00:09:18.929 --> 00:09:23.929
we're going to use a miracle that Jesus performed here on the earth,

00:09:23.929 --> 00:09:29.929
because we know the earthly miracles, poor ten, foreshadow, even greater miracles

00:09:29.929 --> 00:09:33.929
during his time as Messianic King.

00:09:33.929 --> 00:09:37.929
Now, turn, please to Mark chapter four,

00:09:37.929 --> 00:09:42.929
and let's identify superhuman ability number one.

00:09:42.929 --> 00:09:47.929
Mark chapter four, verse 37,

00:09:47.929 --> 00:09:52.929
now a great, violent wind storm broke out,

00:09:52.929 --> 00:09:55.929
and the waves kept crashing into the boat,

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:59.929
so that the boat was close to being swapped.

00:09:59.929 --> 00:10:04.929
But he, Jesus, was in the stern, sleeping on the pillow.

00:10:04.929 --> 00:10:07.929
So they woke him up, and he said to him,

00:10:07.929 --> 00:10:12.929
teacher, do you not care that we're about to perish?

00:10:12.929 --> 00:10:16.929
With that, he got up and rebuked the wind,

00:10:16.929 --> 00:10:19.929
and said to this sea,

00:10:19.929 --> 00:10:24.929
hush, be quiet, and the wind abated,

00:10:24.929 --> 00:10:27.929
and a great calm set in.

00:10:27.929 --> 00:10:33.929
Now, you notice that wind storm is described with a double adjective,

00:10:33.929 --> 00:10:38.929
great, violent wind storm, indicating its ferocity.

00:10:38.929 --> 00:10:42.929
But with three simple words, hush, be quiet.

00:10:42.929 --> 00:10:47.929
Jesus completely calm both wind and sea.

00:10:47.929 --> 00:10:51.929
But now, what does that miracle portend for the future?

00:10:51.929 --> 00:10:53.929
Well, as Messianic King,

00:10:53.929 --> 00:10:58.929
Jesus will have the power to command and control the wind,

00:10:58.929 --> 00:11:03.929
the sea, actually all forces of nature,

00:11:03.929 --> 00:11:06.929
to mankind's benefit.

00:11:06.929 --> 00:11:10.929
Under Kingdom rule, there will be no destructive tsunamis,

00:11:10.929 --> 00:11:17.929
hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, et cetera, et cetera.

00:11:17.929 --> 00:11:22.929
But now, let's identify superhuman ability number two,

00:11:22.929 --> 00:11:26.929
and to do this, just think about the account, if you will,

00:11:26.929 --> 00:11:28.929
in Matthew chapter 14.

00:11:28.929 --> 00:11:32.929
If you recall, with just five loads of bread,

00:11:32.929 --> 00:11:37.929
two little fish, Jesus fed a crowd,

00:11:37.929 --> 00:11:40.929
likely of over 10,000 people,

00:11:40.929 --> 00:11:43.929
if you factor in the women and children,

00:11:43.929 --> 00:11:48.929
and every one of them ate to complete satisfaction,

00:11:48.929 --> 00:11:54.929
while they even gathered up 12 baskets full of fragments

00:11:54.929 --> 00:11:56.929
as leftovers.

00:11:56.929 --> 00:11:59.929
Well, what do we learn from this miracle?

00:11:59.929 --> 00:12:04.929
Jesus, as Messianic King, will exercise authority

00:12:04.929 --> 00:12:08.929
over the organic elements in food and vegetation,

00:12:08.929 --> 00:12:14.929
ensuring that no one under his rule ever goes hungry.

00:12:14.929 --> 00:12:18.929
It's estimated right now more than 800 million people

00:12:18.929 --> 00:12:21.929
go to bed at night hungry.

00:12:21.929 --> 00:12:27.929
That number will be reduced to zero under Kingdom rule.

00:12:27.929 --> 00:12:31.929
No one will have to go to bed hungry at night.

00:12:31.929 --> 00:12:36.929
Psalm 72, 16, there will be an abundance of grain on the earth.

00:12:36.929 --> 00:12:40.929
On the top of the mountains, it will overflow,

00:12:40.929 --> 00:12:42.929
and it won't be just basics.

00:12:42.929 --> 00:12:46.929
Isaiah 25, 6, Jehovah of Armies will make

00:12:46.929 --> 00:12:48.929
for all the peoples,

00:12:48.929 --> 00:12:50.929
that means that nobody left out,

00:12:50.929 --> 00:12:52.929
for all the peoples,

00:12:52.929 --> 00:12:56.929
a banquet of rich dishes,

00:12:56.929 --> 00:13:02.929
a banquet of fine wine, filtered wine.

00:13:02.929 --> 00:13:06.929
Now, we're not talking about ripple Thunderbird wine here.

00:13:06.929 --> 00:13:13.450
We're talking about fine wine,

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:19.450
like Jesus made at that wedding feast in Canaan.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:23.450
But now, let's identify superhuman ability number three.

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:26.450
Go please to Matthew chapter 15.

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:29.450
Matthew 15.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:33.450
And let's read, please, verse number 30.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:38.210
Then large crowds approached him,

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:42.210
bringing along people who were lame,

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:45.210
blamed, blind, speechless,

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:47.210
and many others,

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:49.210
and they laid them at his feet,

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:53.210
and he cured them.

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:55.210
Now, this was amazing, wasn't it?

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:58.210
But what did these healing miracles

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:02.210
portend for Jesus as Messianic king?

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:06.210
Well, he will have the power and the authority

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:11.210
to heal all sicknesses and maladies.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:16.210
See, any sickness, any malady he will heal

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:19.210
under Kingdom rule has promised that Isaiah 33, 24,

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:23.210
no resident, not one,

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:26.210
will say, I am sick.

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:28.210
In fact, Jesus will even have the power

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:31.210
to put the human aging process

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:37.210
into reverse with ones becoming young physically.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.210
Do you recall this video clip?

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:45.700
It was shown at a convention some years ago,

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:49.700
and we're not seeing in this portion

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:53.700
of this video a fantasy.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:57.700
We're looking at reality.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.700
In fact, one brother said,

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.700
can you imagine getting up in the morning,

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.700
put your glasses on,

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.700
you can't see anything.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.700
Everything's blurry.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.700
You take them off.

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:13.700
You can see beautifully, not fantasy.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:18.700
We're talking about reality in Jehovah's New World.

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:22.700
But now let's identify superhuman ability number four.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.700
And to do this, just think if you will,

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.700
of the account in Mark chapter five.

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:32.700
If you recall, very sadly, heart wrenchingly,

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:36.700
a little 12-year-old girl had died.

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.700
But what did Jesus do?

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.700
The account tells us he took her hand

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:46.700
and said, little girl, I say to you, get up.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.700
That girl had been dead, immediately rose,

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.700
and began walking.

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.700
Well, what future accomplishment is signified

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.700
by this miracle?

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:01.700
Well, Jesus and his 144,000 associate kings

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:06.700
will have the power to completely empty the grave,

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.700
the common grave of dead mankind,

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:12.700
by means of the resurrection.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.700
And then, according to Revelation chapter 20 verse 14,

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:21.700
the empty grave will be thrown into the symbolic lake of fire.

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:23.700
It will be abolished forever,

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:29.700
never again to receive another occupant.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:33.700
Well, as I salute superhuman ability number five,

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:37.700
Matthew chapter nine, please, turn there.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.700
Matthew chapter nine.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:44.659
And let's read beginning in verse number three.

00:16:44.659 --> 00:16:47.659
Matthew nine, verse three.

00:16:47.659 --> 00:16:51.659
Now, certain scribes said to themselves,

00:16:51.659 --> 00:16:54.659
this fellow is blaspheming.

00:16:54.659 --> 00:16:58.659
Jesus, knowing their thought said,

00:16:58.659 --> 00:17:03.659
why are you thinking wicked things in your hearts?

00:17:03.659 --> 00:17:08.660
So notice Jesus could read hearts there as a perfect human.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:12.660
What about his Messianic king, even more so?

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.660
He and 144,000 will be able to read hearts,

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.660
and that means what?

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:21.660
They will be able to perfectly judge mankind

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:27.660
with absolutely no mistakes, amazing indeed.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:29.660
Well, let's determine one more,

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:34.660
a six superhuman miraculous ability

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.660
that Jesus will possess and demonstrate.

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:38.660
And we're going to do this.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.660
Let's go to Matthew chapter eight.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.660
Just back a little bit from where you were there.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.660
Matthew eight.

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:47.660
And verse number 16.

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.660
But after it that came evening,

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:56.660
people brought him many demon possessed ones.

00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:00.660
And he expelled the demons with a word.

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:03.660
And he cured all who were suffering.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:07.660
So notice, rather than risk a decisive test of the power

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:09.660
that was back in Jesus,

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.660
the demons obeyed his command

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:16.660
to release these people that they were possessing.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.660
Well, what do we learn from this?

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.660
What is this prefigure?

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:25.660
Jesus and 144,000 will have the power

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:29.660
to act against Satan and his demons.

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:33.660
Because Jesus even granted on the earth his disciples

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.660
that same authority didn't he?

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.660
They were able to expel demons.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.660
So they will certainly have the power even more so

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:43.660
to take action against Satan and his demons.

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:45.660
At the end of the thousand year,

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.660
or the end of the great tribulation,

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.660
I should say first,

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:52.660
they will abyss them.

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:56.660
Then at the end of the final test at the end of the thousand years,

00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:02.660
Jesus joined by the secondary seed of Abraham

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.660
as promised at Genesis 3.15.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:12.660
Jesus will crush the ugliest head in the universe.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.660
Satan's head.

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:18.660
And he will crush the second ugliest heads in the universe,

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:20.660
the heads of the demons.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:24.660
What a tremendous accomplishment in vindication

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:28.660
of Jehovah's name and sovereignty that will be.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.660
Well, there we have six marvelous, miraculous,

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:35.660
superhuman abilities that Jesus will possess

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:39.660
and exercise during his reign.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.660
Human rulers, if we think about it,

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:45.660
couldn't even dream to ever possess

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:49.660
even one of those superhuman abilities.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.660
But Jesus will be able to one,

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:55.660
command and control the forces of nature

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:58.660
to the benefit of all humans.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:02.660
Two, exercise authority over food and vegetation,

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.660
ensuring that no one ever goes hungry.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:10.660
Three, possess the power to heal all sicknesses and maladies.

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:14.660
Four, have the capability to completely empty the grave

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:18.660
by means of the resurrection.

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:23.660
Five, possess the ability to perfectly judge humans

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:27.660
with absolutely no mistakes.

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:33.660
Number six, be empowered to act against Satan and his demons.

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.660
And if you think about it, the four going

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:40.660
are only a few examples of the superhuman royal power

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:44.660
that Jesus will possess as Messianic King.

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:47.660
No wonder he's Jehovah's choice.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:52.660
And no wonder Jehovah has issued the decree

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:56.660
that all, not optional, all must kiss,

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:59.660
warmly welcome his son.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:03.660
Now, it's true, a kiss can be hypocritical, can it?

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:08.660
You know, Absalom gave out many, probably better say,

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:11.660
gave off many hypocritical kisses.

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:14.660
He was kissing everybody, wasn't he?

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:16.660
Hypocritical.

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:19.660
We read the account Treacher's Joab.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:26.660
Hypocritically kissed Amesa just before he murdered him.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:31.660
And by means of a disgusting hypocritical quote,

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:37.660
tender kiss, Judas betrayed Jesus.

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:40.660
But brothers and sisters, our kiss of Jesus

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.660
is not hypocritical.

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:47.660
From the bottom of our heart, by our conduct, by our words,

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:51.660
we warmly welcome Jehovah's choice, don't we?

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.660
We're so happy.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:57.660
And we tell everybody about this that he is already installed

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:01.660
as King and he will soon be the ruler for all the earth.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:04.660
And we want to help honest hearted ones

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:09.660
to likewise, sincerely, affectionately kiss welcome God's son.

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:14.660
We do this urgently during the limited window of time,

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:18.660
during this kiss God's son invitation time period.

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:23.660
Before it's now too late, time period arrives

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:28.660
when ones will be told, get ready to meet your God.

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:33.660
Of course, sadly, as we know, the vast majority,

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:38.660
especially the rulers, will adamantly continue to do so.

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:42.660
But we are not like them because these ones,

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:47.660
the anger of Jehovah and Jesus, will blaze against them.

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:51.660
But made Jehovah richly bless you dear brothers and sisters,

00:22:51.660 --> 00:23:00.660
as you continue to affectionately, warmly welcome Jehovah's choice.

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:05.660
And as you work hard to help other honest hearted ones

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:07.660
to do the same.
