WEBVTT

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:05.759
I just don't get it.

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.759
Kevin knows we're in the great tribulation.

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.759
Why would he say he doesn't want anything to do with us anymore?

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.759
Darren, I thought you had heard by now.

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:17.760
I heard what?

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.760
When our message changed from good news to judgment,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.760
he was telling everyone that it would make problems for us

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.760
and that he was done.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.449
I can't believe it.

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.820
Darren, think about it.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.820
We have all tried to help Kevin.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.820
Yeah, I remember.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.820
Think back to Sunday afternoons when we preached

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.820
in the Northern Estates.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.820
We asked if he wanted to go.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.820
Did he give us a say?

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.820
Well, we're going to the Northern Estates and then,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.820
Hey, Kevin, do you want to join us?

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.820
He said he had a weekend shift.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.820
Again, but that the people there have their paradise

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.820
and they don't listen anyway.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.219
The cars are weird.

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:08.219
And when we do public witnessing, hey, Kevin,

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:11.219
we've been having great experiences out there at Turner Street.

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:12.219
Yeah, that sounds nice.

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:14.219
Yeah, that's by your job.

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:17.719
Do you get to talk to your co-workers about it?

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:23.950
He said it wasn't a good idea to make waves out of the store.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.950
For as much as we've all tried to help Kevin,

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.950
he let his fear of man go unresolved.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.950
Proverbs says,

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.950
Trambling at men is a snare.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.950
If Kevin couldn't preach with boldness during favorable times,

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.950
imagine how much harder it was for him

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.950
to clearly rely on Jehovah during this difficult time.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:02:16.530
Yeah, now, during the Great Tribulation.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.530
What is going on out there?

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.530
They're just north of town searching every house.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.530
Every house?

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.530
Yeah, the neighbor has an panic.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.530
Let's stay calm and lean on Jehovah.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.530
At some point, we can expect the final attack on God's people.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.530
But Jehovah is going to give us the courage we need.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.530
So let's pray together.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.530
We'll read the scriptures

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.530
and we'll keep sharing what's helped us remain loyal to God.
