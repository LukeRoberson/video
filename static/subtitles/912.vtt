Brother Jean-Marcocca is one of many of Jehovah's Witnesses in Angola who faced cruel persecution because of their faith.

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:26.120
And during the decades of the 1940s until the 1970s, Brother Marcocca endured prison, penal colonies, and much torture as well as separation from his family.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:34.689
Despite this, he never stopped strengthening himself and others.

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:40.689
My father, Adawa Gostinho, was arrested in the early 1970s.

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:43.689
And in prison, who did he find?

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:50.689
Brother Marcocca and other brothers who also had faced cruel persecution for a long time.

00:00:50.689 --> 00:01:00.689
Brother Marcocca was a mentor to my father, so every night he would go by Brother Marcocca's bed and ask him many questions about the Bible.

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:04.689
In his memoirs, my father wrote something very interesting.

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:12.689
He was very impatient with me. I took with me a wealth of knowledge that helped me in the trials that followed.

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:20.689
Today, I cannot imagine what my life would be like without this inheritance that was passed down by those loyal brothers.

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:29.689
My father, Silvesse Mal, in Brother Jean-Marcocca, saved together on the Angola branch committee, but that was not where they met.

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:37.689
When my father attended his first meeting as a Bible student, Brother Marcocca was conducting the Wajta study.

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:48.689
Suddenly, the meeting place was raided, and Brother Marcocca became concerned because a good number of those in attendance were Bible students, including my father.

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.689
Brother Marcocca asked that they release the students, but that did not happen.

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.689
They beat them up. They beat them up brutally, all the men that were there.

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:09.689
In fact, my dad said he thought that he was going to die on that day because the beating was so brutal and he lost a lot of blood.

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:17.689
In the face of this situation, Brother Marcocca was concerned. He said a sincere prayer for Jehovah to protect his sheep.

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:27.689
And that was what happened. Jehovah protected them. My dad could see that Brother Marcocca was more concerned with them than he was with himself.

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:32.689
Brother Marcocca also had the opportunity to help others to get to know the truth.

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:40.689
And one of them is my uncle, Philip Kunia. He was in that jail as a political prisoner, and he learned the truth.

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:47.689
And as a result, four generations of our family today are Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:56.689
The situation of Brother Marcocca and other brothers who faced persecution here in Angola proves that with Jehovah's help,

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:07.689
we can face persecution. When a person does not have patience, he cannot persevere because he is looking at the time when the trial will end.

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:16.689
On the other hand, patience helped the brothers to deal with trials, focusing on what they could do and on Jehovah's help.
