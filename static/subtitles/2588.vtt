WEBVTT

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:09.759
Well, we know that you, brothers and sisters of the 157th class are ready for your assignments.

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:16.920
We know that because every day for five months, you've been focusing on Jehovah.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.839
You've been learning about the meaning of his name, his qualities, his activities,

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:25.879
his word, his wonderful organization.

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:29.039
And these are things that make Jehovah glorious.

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.320
They fill us with awe, they impress us.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.780
And because you have focused on Jehovah's glory, your faith has been strengthened, you're

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:47.960
filled with power and determination, so you are ready for your assignments.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.460
But after you get to your assignment, your success will depend on your continuing to

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.340
see Jehovah's glory every day.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.539
How can you do that?

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:05.019
Well, let's see by turning in our Bibles to the very first mention of Jehovah's glory.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.140
It's found in Exodus 16 and verse 7.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.859
And you remember the account here, the Israelites were complaining about the apparent lack of food,

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:21.459
and the Moses was told to tell them this in verse 7.

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:27.459
This is in the morning, you will see Jehovah's glory, for he has heard your murmurings

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:30.219
against Jehovah.

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:36.459
Now in the verses that follow, God's glory is associated with his arrangement to provide

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:41.299
mana, and that they would see in the morning.

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:47.540
And consider two ways how that arrangement was evidence of Jehovah's glory.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.739
First how the mana was provided was miraculous.

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:56.819
It showed up every day, except the seventh day, and it didn't matter where in the wilderness

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:02.939
you were or what time of year it was, mana showed up right on time.

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.620
And while they had to gather it, clearly this wasn't food that they could produce on

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.419
their own.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:14.780
Second, what mana accomplished was miraculous.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.699
It fed the Israelites for 40 years, and it didn't matter what your activity was, or

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:25.139
your assignment was, they all got the same amount.

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:30.099
Whether you were marching in the wilderness, or you were just staying put in camp, whether

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:37.020
you are Aaron or Moses down to the least Israelite or Egyptian, each one got the same amount

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.900
just what they needed.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.939
So each morning that mana appeared, the Israelites were seeing impressive evidence of Jehovah's

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:47.659
glory.

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:54.340
But to benefit, they needed to always recognize that Jehovah knew how to feed them.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.979
He knew what to feed them, and above all that Jehovah was the one feeding them.

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:05.780
Sadly, many failed to make the connection between the mana that they ate every day and Jehovah's

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.620
glory.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.500
Now how Jehovah fed the Israelites teaches us lessons about how he feeds us spiritually

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.219
today, and the way that he is doing it is far more glorious than anything the Israelites

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:22.180
witnessed in the wilderness.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.819
Consider two ways.

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.139
How Jehovah provides spiritual food is evidence of his power.

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:34.780
I mean, just consider the Bible, it's very survival is evidence that Jehovah is behind

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:42.020
this book, and you have been convinced that it truthfully is the Word of God.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.740
The arrangement to provide spiritual food through the faithful slave shows Jehovah's power

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:47.740
and glory.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:54.099
Now, that slave isn't perfect, they're not inspired, but ever since 1919, that slave has

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.259
provided food and do measure at the right time.

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:03.379
Today, virtually all of Jehovah's people receive the same basic spiritual food at the same

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:10.060
time in their own language, all free of charge, and it may seem ordinary to us, but we don't

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.060
take it for granted because we make the connection between what's happening and Jehovah's

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.579
glory, his power.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:23.019
A second, what spiritual food accomplishes is evidence of Jehovah's glory.

00:04:23.019 --> 00:04:29.300
He's satisfying the needs of over nine million of your brothers and sisters in 240 lands.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:35.019
No matter our age or circumstances, our race or culture, our nationality or background,

00:04:35.019 --> 00:04:38.660
we're all receiving spiritual food at the right time.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:44.420
And as a result, we're gathered together in a united, loving brotherhood.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.939
We're supporting pure worship.

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:50.579
We're focused on the same thing, preaching the good news of God's kingdom.

00:04:50.579 --> 00:04:52.939
Now, what accounts for this?

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:57.180
I mean, after all, we're not the only people that believe that the Bible is God's Word,

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.100
who read it and study it.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.420
We're not the only people that produce and distribute religious literature or are very zealous

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.139
about what they believe.

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:12.620
But there is nothing that compares with our united brotherhood.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.100
It is the result, not of human effort.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.100
It's a miracle.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.660
It's evidence of Jehovah's power.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.100
And of course, you know all of these things.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.779
You're convinced of these things.

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:29.660
But the example of the Israelites and the manna reminds us of how important it is to

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:35.779
see Jehovah's glory every day in the way that he feeds us spiritually.

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:37.660
How can we do that?

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:44.100
Well, put simply, it's by recognizing what many of the Israelites failed to recognize.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.740
Recognize that Jehovah knows how to feed you spiritually.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.300
Regardless of the responsibilities that await you, do your best to keep the same basic routine

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.500
that Jehovah's people around the world follow.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.819
Daily Bible reading, family worship, the meetings, reading the watchtower, watching the

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:08.060
broadcast, you know, like manna, those very basic spiritual provisions are for all of

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.500
God's people, regardless of our assignment or our activity.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:18.980
And that basic routine will ensure that your spirituality keeps pace with your privileges

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.060
and responsibilities.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.860
Second, recognize that Jehovah knows what to feed you spiritually.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:31.819
Now, over time, it may be possible to underestimate the value of what we receive.

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:36.500
After all, maybe the meetings, the magazines, the broadcast covers topics that we're familiar

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.500
with.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.699
Maybe it's material that doesn't apply directly to us.

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:47.300
Or maybe the presentation is simple compared to the deeper studies that you're used to.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:52.459
Well, we need to be careful not to make the same fatal mistake the Israelites made to

00:06:52.459 --> 00:06:57.899
become dissatisfied or questioned whether or not what Jehovah was providing would sustain

00:06:57.899 --> 00:06:58.899
them.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:04.579
Remember, Jehovah knew what to feed the Israelites and he knows what to feed his people today.

00:07:04.579 --> 00:07:11.300
And all of those things that Jehovah provides are intended to put his word in our heart.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.660
And when that happens, something powerful happens.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:19.740
In fact, take a look at 1 John 2 verse 14.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:24.459
Now you remember here the Apostle John was writing different groups in the congregation

00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:30.100
verse 14. He writes, fathers, those who are mature, he writes young men, those who are less

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.100
experienced.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:35.300
Notice what he says to the young men at the end of verse 14.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.819
He says, I write you young men because you are strong.

00:07:38.819 --> 00:07:44.379
And the word of God remains in you and you have conquered the wicked one.

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:48.579
What an amazing statement they have conquered the wicked one.

00:07:48.579 --> 00:07:51.060
That wasn't the result of their willpower.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.180
That was the result of God's power.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.939
His word and their heart.

00:07:54.939 --> 00:07:58.540
And that's what Jehovah is doing for his people today.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:03.300
What Jehovah is feeding us is helping us to remain no part of the world and to maintain

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.939
our integrity.

00:08:04.939 --> 00:08:12.100
It's that routine that has prepared our brothers and sisters for prison to face natural disasters,

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.420
to cope with chronic illness.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:20.139
Jehovah knows what to feed his people and that feeding program will help you remain spiritually

00:08:20.139 --> 00:08:22.259
strong.

00:08:22.259 --> 00:08:27.379
And finally, always recognize that it's Jehovah who's feeding you.

00:08:27.379 --> 00:08:32.500
You know, keeping that in mind will help you to remain humble regardless of the assignment

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.100
or privileges that await you.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:39.980
And rather than draw attention to yourself or focus on other individuals in the organization,

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:45.460
it will move you to give Jehovah the credit that he deserves, do not make the same mistake

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:50.460
that the Israelites made, do not fail to see Jehovah behind the spiritual food, to see

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:54.179
his glory in the way that he's feeding you.

00:08:54.179 --> 00:08:59.179
Never let your words and actions cause you to take the miracle out of the miracle, to

00:08:59.179 --> 00:09:04.379
attribute to mere humans what only Jehovah is accomplishing.

00:09:04.379 --> 00:09:07.700
Well brothers and sisters, keep doing what you have been doing.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:13.500
See Jehovah's glory every day and always trust that he knows how to feed you.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:18.100
He knows what to feed you and always recognize who is feeding you.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.059
Your grand and glorious instructor, Jehovah God.
