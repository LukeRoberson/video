00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:06.360
A brother feels guilty because he did things before his baptism.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.359
A parent feels guilty because his children left the truth.

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:16.359
A sister feels guilty because she divorced her own faithful husband.

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:19.359
What do all these people have in common?

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:23.359
They suffer from inappropriate guilt.

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:29.359
Now, a comedian joked religion is basically guilt with different holidays.

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.359
Why is it that religious people carry so much guilt?

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:37.359
And can anything good come from it?

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:43.359
The Bible, of course, associates guilt with laws, sin, and transgression.

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:48.359
Open your Bibles with me to Galatians 3 and verse 19.

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:54.359
And notice the effect the mosaic law had on the Israelites.

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:58.359
Paul says, why then the law?

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:03.359
It was added to make transgressions manifest.

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.359
So the law reminded God's people every day that they were sinners.

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:11.359
Jehovah's law was perfect. No one could live up to it.

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:16.359
So for the Israelites, feeling guilty was inescapable.

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:22.359
Now, why would Jehovah do that? Why give them a law to make them feel guilty?

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:25.359
Well, there were at least three reasons.

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:29.359
First, we should feel guilty when we've done something wrong.

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:36.359
It reminds us of Jehovah's position as universal sovereign and his righteous standards.

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:40.359
And it confirms that our conscience is working.

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:48.359
Second, we can all admit that there are times when we may not have done something wrong yet,

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:52.359
but we may be wanting to.

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:55.359
And at that point, guilt is our friend.

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:58.359
In some ways, it's like physical pain.

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:02.359
Physical pain makes us aware of a potential health problem.

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:11.360
And the emotional pain of guilt alerts us to the fact that there may be potential moral or spiritual problems.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.360
And finally, third, when someone confesses his guilt,

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.360
it helps both the wrongdoer and the victim.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.360
The victim brings the guilty person relief through forgiveness.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:31.360
And it makes the victim feel better when he sees that the guilty one loves him enough to apologize.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:38.360
Unfortunately, we can feel guilty even without being guilty.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:47.360
And inappropriate guilt often leads people to emotional distress and sometimes even harsh self-criticism.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:55.360
Let's consider three situations where inappropriate guilt can paralyze us and also what we can do to get rid of it.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.360
The first situation is what we might call persistent guilt.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:10.360
This is guilt for something you did, repented over, even received forgiveness for, but you can't forgive yourself.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.360
So you continue to ruminate over the matter and it saps your joy and strength.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.360
What can you do?

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.360
Well, consider the apostle Paul.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.360
There were times when the things he did in the past upset him.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.360
How did he handle those feelings?

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:36.360
To answer, let's read together, 1 Corinthians 15 and verses 9 and 10.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.360
As we know, Paul, before he was baptized, persecuted Christ's brothers.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.360
He even supported the stoning of Stephen.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.360
How do you think those memories made him feel?

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.360
Well, notice what he says in verse 9.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:04:03.830
For I am the least of the apostles and I am not worthy of being called an apostle because I persecuted the congregation of God.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:13.830
Now, when you're in a position of responsibility like Paul was, feelings of unworthiness like this can be devastating.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:20.829
Satan tries to make you doubt yourself whether you still have God's approval in your life.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:30.829
And he often does this when you're most vulnerable, when you're already crushed under the weight of your own failures and disappointments.

00:04:30.829 --> 00:04:34.829
But Paul didn't let these feelings defeat him.

00:04:34.829 --> 00:04:36.829
He didn't give into the pressure.

00:04:36.829 --> 00:04:38.829
Notice what he says next in verse 10.

00:04:38.829 --> 00:04:45.079
But by God's undeserved kindness, I am what I am.

00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:52.079
And his undeserved kindness to me was not in vain, but I labored more than all of them.

00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:58.079
Yet it was not I, but the undeserved kindness of God that is with me.

00:04:58.079 --> 00:05:04.079
So Paul realized that Jehovah accepted him for what he was.

00:05:04.079 --> 00:05:10.079
And he knew that he couldn't change whatever happened in the past, no matter how much he might want to.

00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:17.079
He accepted God's undeserved kindness and he let Jehovah use him.

00:05:17.079 --> 00:05:21.079
Well, like Paul, we've repented over our past sins.

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:24.079
We've confessed them to the extent necessary.

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:29.079
So we can be sure too that Jehovah will be merciful with us.

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:30.079
Why?

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:35.079
Because Jehovah promises that he forgives in a large way.

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:40.079
So we can take him at his word and accept his forgiveness.

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:48.079
Now, we might refer to a second situation that makes people suffer as compassion guilt.

00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:55.079
This is feeling guilty because you didn't do enough to help someone.

00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:59.079
And caregivers often struggle with feelings like this.

00:05:59.079 --> 00:06:07.079
Even when they're doing all they can to help, they sometimes feel guilty about not being able to do more.

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:11.079
One sister who was caring for her elderly parents said,

00:06:12.079 --> 00:06:19.079
having to say, I can't take care of you anymore is extremely difficult.

00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:23.079
What can help those in this situation?

00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:31.740
Well, notice what Ecclesiastes 7 and verse 16 says we should all avoid.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:37.740
Do not be overly righteous nor show yourself excessively wise.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.740
Why should you bring ruin to yourself?

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:48.740
Another way we could put this is avoid becoming a perfectionist.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.740
Conscientiousness can easily deteriorate into perfectionism.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:59.740
If we're trying to do more than we want to, can do or even should do,

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:05.740
then we're only setting ourselves up for disappointment and failure.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:15.740
To illustrate some people see caregiving as a way to repay their parents for all they did while they were growing up.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:24.740
But if we see it that way, we're always going to feel guilty because we can never fully repay our parents.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:31.740
Acting out of guilt will only drain us over time and make us less effective as a caregiver.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.740
What can we do instead?

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.740
We can share the load.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:40.740
Family, friends, neighbors and professionals can be of help.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:49.740
But we have to ask for help and we have to ask directly for it, hence seldom work.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:59.740
It may surprise us who and how many are willing to pitch in if we make our needs known.

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:06.740
Finally, a third situation that's paralyzing for some is imagined guilt.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:11.740
This is guilt over something you think you did, but didn't.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.740
For example, Teresa's daughter died in a car accident and she says,

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:21.740
I felt guilty that I had sent her out that night on an errand.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:30.740
Another sister says that guilt that you feel during a divorce, even if you're not the guilty party, can be overwhelming.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.740
What can someone do in this situation?

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:41.740
Well, first, it's important not to bottle up those emotions, share your feelings with a friend who really listened to you.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:49.740
Allow them to reassure you that irrational feelings are common, especially when you're grieving.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:56.740
But second, no matter how much we love someone, we can't control his or her life.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:01.740
Remember what Ecclesiastes 9 and verse 11 says.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.740
This is true for all of us.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:20.309
I have seen something further under the sun that the swift do not always win the race, nor do the mighty win the battle, nor do the wise always have the food, nor do the intelligent always have the riches.

00:09:21.309 --> 00:09:31.309
Nor do those with knowledge always have success, because time and unexpected events overtake them all.

00:09:31.309 --> 00:09:36.309
So we are not to blame for things we cannot control.

00:09:36.309 --> 00:09:43.309
Before you accuse yourself of wrongdoing, make sure that wrongdoing actually took place.

00:09:43.309 --> 00:09:57.309
Talk it over with a trusted friend, and refocus your thoughts on the future, reflecting on all kinds of if only's won't change anything, and it may slow down your recovery.

00:09:57.309 --> 00:10:02.309
Don't let inappropriate guilt control your life.

00:10:02.309 --> 00:10:14.309
So in review, a guilty conscience can and should move us to confess our sins and to take positive action, but inappropriate guilt is dangerous.

00:10:14.309 --> 00:10:19.309
It can crush our spirit and keep us from giving our best to Jehovah.

00:10:19.309 --> 00:10:29.309
Don't let guilt paralyze you, concentrate all your energies on what you can do right now, and on what lies ahead.
