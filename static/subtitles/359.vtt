00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:09.199
In your ministry, have you ever met someone who strongly believes that we are still under the Ten Commandments?

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:18.199
That can happen at times, because many people, especially in the southern parts of this country, feel very strongly about the Ten Commandments.

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:28.199
There are even legal battles going on as to whether monuments displaying the Ten Commandments can be displayed on government property.

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:38.200
And, of course, many people feel that the Ten Commandments basically are what was used for the Constitution and for the laws of many countries.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:46.200
So, at one point, perhaps a person might say to us, do you believe that we are still under the Ten Commandments?

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:57.200
Perhaps you may diplomatically answer, well, I believe we're under the principles of the Ten Commandments and the Law of Love, the Law of the Christ.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.200
A person may push the point and say, but do you believe the Ten Commandments are binding today?

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.200
Well, when we give them an explanation from the Scriptures, perhaps they may feel disappointed.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:15.200
And maybe they realize that there's a verse in the Bible that they feel supports their belief.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:24.200
So, let's take our Bibles and turn to Matthew chapter 5, the sermon on the Mount, from which our text is taken this morning.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.200
And perhaps they may point to verses 17 and 18.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.200
Now, that reads, do not think I came to destroy the Law or the prophets.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.200
I came not to destroy, but to fulfill.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:51.200
Truly, I say to you that sooner would heaven and earth pass away than for one stroke of a letter to pass away from the Law until all things take place.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:02:01.200
Now, this person in presenting their explanation may show that they believe this expression fulfilled means established permanently.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.200
And even some Bible commentaries say that this involves total commitment.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.199
Well, how would you answer the person at that stage? How can we help them?

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:21.199
Perhaps you might take them through a series of Scriptures, such as Romans chapter 10 verse 4, where it says Christ is the end of the Law.

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:34.199
You might read Galatians chapter 4 verses 4 and 5, where it says those under the Law were released, or Ephesians 2 verse 15, where it speaks of the Law being abolished.

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:46.199
But if you've done that, perhaps you've had the same experience that I have, that a person may agree with those Scriptures, but say, that's not referring to the Ten Commandments.

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:54.199
That's referring to all the other laws in the Mosaic Law arrangement, but the Ten Commandments remain forever.

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:58.199
Well, how can you help someone to reason on that matter?

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:10.199
Well, let's look back again at Matthew chapter 5, and we noticed there in verses 17 and 18, it mentions Jesus came not to destroy, but to fulfill.

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:20.199
And we could ask the person how they understand the word fulfill, what they feel that means, and perhaps they might say, establish permanently.

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:27.199
Well, then we could point out that Jesus continues then to talk about various aspects of the Law.

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:36.199
If we look at verse 21, what do we notice? You heard that it was said to those of ancient times, you must not murder.

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:40.199
So yes, this is one of the Ten Commandments.

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:54.199
Interestingly, the study Bible, on a note on this verse says, this phrase, you heard that it was said, can refer both to the things stated in the inspired Hebrew Scriptures and to teachings of Jewish tradition.

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:57.199
And we'll see this as we go on.

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:02.199
If we go to verse 23, what does it talk about here?

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:09.199
If then you are bringing your gift to the altar, and there you remember your brother has something against you.

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:16.199
This is not part of the Ten Commandments, is it? It's talking about the arrangements for sacrifices.

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:24.199
Then if we look at verse 27, you heard that it was said, you must not commit adultery.

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.199
Well, again, we have the Ten Commandments.

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:38.199
But if we look at verse 31, Jesus here says, moreover, it was said, whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:42.199
That's not one of the Ten Commandments, is it?

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:51.199
Reading on further in verse 33, it says, again, you heard that it was said to those of ancient times, you must not swear without performing.

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.199
Again, not one of the Ten Commandments.

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:02.199
Verse 38, you heard that it was said, I for I and tooth for tooth.

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:05.199
Again, not one of the Ten Commandments.

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:10.199
And then we come to the scripture we've been considering this morning in verse 43.

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:17.199
You heard that it was said, you must love your neighbor and hate your enemy.

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:22.199
Now, when we consider this, we look at the study Bible notes on this verse.

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:25.199
It makes this comment about hate your enemy.

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:29.199
It says, the mosaic law contained no such command.

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:36.199
Some Jewish rabbis believe that the command to love their neighbor implied that they should hate their enemy.

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:41.199
So this wasn't really part of the law that Moses gave.

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:44.199
But what do we see from this?

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:55.199
Well, if a person argues very strongly that the word fulfilled when Jesus is talking about the law applies to the Ten Commandments only,

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:01.199
we look down here at Jesus when he's talking about the law doesn't just talk about the Ten Commandments, does he?

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:05.199
He talks about all these things, including even the oral tradition.

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:10.199
So if a person were to believe that Jesus' words when saying fulfilled,

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:15.199
referred to absolutely establishing something permanently,

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:22.199
would also feel or have to feel that he's referring to this law, I for I, tooth for tooth.

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:26.199
When, in fact, he showed something better than that, didn't he?

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:30.199
And the same too with the screenshot for today's text.

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:32.199
So what do we see here?

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:35.199
Well, we can't make that comment about Jesus' words.

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:41.199
So what does it mean when it says to fulfill and not to destroy?

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:50.199
Perhaps a simple illustration would help us if someone signs a contract as a builder to build a home for someone else.

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:54.199
What does it mean to destroy the contract?

00:06:54.199 --> 00:07:02.199
Well, perhaps it means ripping it up, burning it, getting rid of it, certainly not building the house.

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:08.199
But on the other hand, what does it mean to fulfill the contract to build the house?

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:11.199
Well, it means that the person builds a house.

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:18.199
But once the house is built, then the contract is completed or fulfilled.

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:24.199
This person is an under obligation to continue over and over again to keep building the same house.

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:30.199
So perhaps an illustration such as that may help someone of humble heart

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:35.199
to see that when Jesus said he came not to destroy but to fulfill,

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:41.199
that he wasn't there to eradicate the law in Galatians 4 mentions he was born under law.

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:45.199
So he had to fulfill or complete or do what the law stated.

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:54.199
But of course the other scriptures help us when they tell us that the law was completed, that the Christ was the end to the law.

00:07:54.199 --> 00:07:59.199
Now perhaps the person might still find this a little difficult to comprehend.

00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:03.199
But one final scripture we could share with them is in the book of Romans.

00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:08.199
Romans chapter 7 and verses 6 and 7.

00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:11.199
Romans 7, 6 and 7.

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:21.199
Verse 6 says, but now we have been released from the law because we have died to that which restrained us

00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:28.199
in order that we might be slaves in a new sense by the spirit and not in the old sense by the written code.

00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:32.200
Now if we pause there perhaps the person might jump in and say,

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.200
I guess that's the law that doesn't include the Ten Commandments.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.200
Those are all the other laws but the Ten Commandments remain forever.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.200
Well then we ask them just let's read on verse 7.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.200
What does it say?

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.200
What then are we to say?

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.200
Is the law sin?

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.200
Certainly not.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.200
Really I would not have come to know sin had it not been for the law.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.200
For example now what example is Paul going to use?

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:10.200
For example I would not have known covetousness if the law had not said you must not cover it.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:18.200
So obviously the apostle Paul and our Lord Jesus Christ did not separate the law into two parts,

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.200
the Ten Commandments and the other laws.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:30.200
So we can see clearly from here that we have a good answer to give persons when they adamantly state that the Ten Commandments are still binding.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:37.200
Hopefully we can go on then to help them to see that Jesus was teaching us the principles behind the laws

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:46.200
and that the law of the Christ involves loving Jehovah and loving our neighbors and then following what direction Jehovah has given us.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:54.200
So you may think this is quite a complicated subject to discuss early in the morning.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:10:00.200
But next time when someone does ask you do you believe the Ten Commandments are binding?

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.200
Hopefully you remember these comments.
