00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:08.910
But when you see someone in need, are you generous in providing that help or do you hold back?

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:13.070
What kind of a person does Jehovah want us to be?

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:18.030
Let's look at our scripture again, and this time, let's read two verses.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.230
That's Proverbs 3

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.190
27 and 28.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.829
Do not withhold good from those to whom you should give it.

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.429
If it is within your power to help, do not say to your neighbor, go away, come back later.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.149
I will give it to you tomorrow if you can give it now.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:50.990
Clearly, Jehovah wants us to be generous, but he also indicates he knows that sometimes we hold back.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.670
Why? Why would a person hold back from doing good to others or helping others?

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.229
If he sees someone that has a need.

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:05.150
Well, there can be various reasons. Certainly, all of us

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.310
have to fight against the inborn tendency to be selfish.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.709
But there could be other factors. For example, perhaps one grew up in a family

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:24.349
that had very little money and very few resources, and the parents were constantly concerned about

00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:29.870
making ends meet, and children could grow up with feelings of insecurity.

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:38.829
Well, if that is the case with us, how can we rid ourselves of a feeling of insecurity

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.750
that if we give to others, we won't have something for ourselves?

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.150
Well, it comes down to really knowing and trusting Jehovah God.

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:58.430
We know Jehovah God is a generous person. In fact, the most generous person in all the universe.

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:09.870
Creation tells us that. Psalm 145 verse 16 says that he opens his hand and satisfies

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:18.509
the desire of every living thing. James 117 says that he is a giver of every good gift

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.229
and perfect present. So we know Jehovah is generous and we want to be like him.

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:36.030
But also, we must trust Jehovah. How is that? Well, notice this promise in Proverbs a few pages

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:47.150
away in chapter 11 and verses 24 and 25. One gives generously and ends up with more.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:56.750
Another withholds what should be given. But he comes to poverty. The generous person will prosper

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:04.830
and whoever refreshes others will himself be refreshed. Yes, the generous person will prosper. That's

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:14.430
God's promise. Have you ever noticed how very often persons with very few resources are the most

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.830
generous? I was thinking about a situation that occurred here at Patterson some months ago.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.750
My brother in a Pioneer Service School class got the news that his father was near death

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:36.430
in a hospital many thousands of miles away. Well, when his classmates and his department learned

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:44.030
about this, they gathered together enough funds so that he could fly home and see his father before

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:52.830
he died. How generous. In another case, well, we have to say that the organization really is

00:03:52.909 --> 00:04:00.270
filled with people who know and trust Jehovah and they apply this direction to be generous.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:09.069
Recently, an elder related his experience. About three years ago, he and his wife really came into

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:18.829
need. Unexpectedly, she became pregnant and there were complications early on. And the doctor said,

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:27.230
you must stay in bed for the rest of your pregnancy. So she couldn't get up to cook or clean

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.589
or do part-time work as she had been doing. This was a difficult situation for them. They

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:41.069
prayed earnestly to Jehovah for help and guidance. The brothers and sisters in the congregation saw

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:48.029
their need for help. Many of them called them to give encouragement. Others came and sat with

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:58.430
his wife. But one dear sister called the brother at work and said, brother, so and so, I know this

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.750
is a rough time for you. So until your wife gets back on her feet, you will have a hot dinner twice

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:11.629
a week. And she did that faithfully for almost nine months every Tuesday and every Friday.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:22.829
But what was remarkable about this was that this sister had lupus and she often was very sick.

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:29.069
And once she was sick, the brother would tell her, you don't have to prepare a meal for us. I will

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:36.990
come home and I will cook. But she insisted to prepare the meal for both of them. And here's what

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:44.350
she told the brother. After all, the elders have to prepare spiritual food and shepherd the congregation

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:50.350
no matter what is going on in their lives. And when the elders are tired or not feeling well,

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:58.189
if one of their friends needs help, they would come and assist. So if the elders can do that, I can too.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:05.870
She also said, she loves Jehovah and she knows Jehovah loves her because at times when she is not

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:14.110
well, he still gives her the strength to keep going. So she is only showing the same love Jehovah

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:21.790
is showing her. Now how beautiful is that love? That is the key. When we feel Jehovah's love,

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:28.509
then our gratitude moves us to help others to show love in a very practical way.

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:36.990
But generosity takes many forms. It does not always involve giving others something materially.

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:49.949
Interestingly, in Luke 1141, Jesus told the Pharisees to give as gifts of mercy the things that are

00:06:49.949 --> 00:07:00.589
from within the things that are from within. So evidently, Jesus was referring to qualities of

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:10.430
the heart, such as love and compassion and empathy. So we do not want to be emotionally stingy.

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:16.990
We want to share positive emotions with others. So how can we do that?

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:25.149
Well, we can get into the habit of always thinking, how can we make others around us feel better?

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:33.790
Sharing positive emotions includes praising others sincerely, rewarding others,

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:43.230
recognizing the talents of others, showing signs of appreciation for what they are doing and what

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:49.550
they are. So don't hold back your love and your encouragement. Do it today.

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:59.389
Your heart is filled with a new supply of love every day. And whatever you don't give away is gone

00:07:59.389 --> 00:08:07.470
forever. If we give from the heart, we will not expect anything back in return, but the fact is,

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:14.910
we will be rewarded. Because as the Scripture said, we read earlier, the one refreshing others will

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:24.670
himself be refreshed. We will be happier. And the quality of generosity will grow in us. And it is

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:33.870
contagious with our realizing that our acts of generosity effectively plant little seeds of generosity

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:46.269
in others. And just as we imitate your hopeless generosity, they too will do so.
