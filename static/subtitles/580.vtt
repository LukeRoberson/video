00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:08.980
Our text and comments focus on how Jehovah makes clear to anointed Christians that they've been chosen for heavenly life.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.980
But when a Christian is anointed, does that mean that he or she automatically receives that reward?

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.980
Well, please look at the last sentence in the comments for today. It answers that question by stating,

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:30.980
so even though an anointed Christian has been called to go to heaven, he will get his reward only if he remains faithful.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:43.979
Only if he remains faithful. And that principle applies to those of us with the earthly hope. Jehovah will reward us with life in his promised new world only if we remain faithful.

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:55.979
So let's consider the theme Jehovah rewards his faithful servants. How do we know that Jehovah wants to reward his faithful servants? How did he do so in the past?

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:00.979
And what are some rewards that we receive from our loving heavenly Father?

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:07.980
As one expression of his tender love for us, Jehovah takes the initiative to reward his faithful servants.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:20.980
Let's read about that together. Hebrews chapter 11, please turn their Hebrews chapter 11, and notice the connection here between faith and Jehovah being a rewarder in verse 6.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:36.980
Moreover, without faith, it is impossible to please God well for whoever approaches God must believe that he is and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:53.980
So the more we love Jehovah, the stronger our faith becomes not only in the fact that he exists, but our faith is strengthened that Jehovah unfailingly rewards those whom he loves, those who are faithful, those who earnestly seek him.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.980
Being a rewarder is an integral part of who Jehovah is and what he does.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:07.980
Jesus highlighted that in a discussion with his disciples. Please turn with me to Matthew chapter 19. Let's read about it together.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:18.319
Matthew 19, and in verse 27, notice this question raised by Peter, Matthew 19, 27.

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:28.319
Then Peter said in reply, look, we have left all things and followed you. What then will there be for us?

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:36.319
Jesus knew that Peter, Andrew, James, and John had left behind the fishing business in order to follow him.

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:46.319
So instead of viewing Peter's question negatively and rebuking him, Jesus told his disciples that they would be rewarded for their faithfulness, for their sacrifices.

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.319
Notice what he said, verse 28, Jesus said to them,

00:02:50.319 --> 00:03:01.319
Truly I say to you in the recreation when a son of man sits down on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:15.319
And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for the sake of my name will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit everlasting life.

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:23.319
So notice Jesus said his disciples would be rewarded not only in the future, but there would be present rewards.

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:32.319
The spiritual fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, and children would be much more valuable than anything that the apostles had left behind.

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.319
What a reward.

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:41.319
Well, it's obvious from the scriptures that Jehovah wants to reward his faithful servants.

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.319
How did he do so in the past?

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.319
Well, one example we could think of is Joseph.

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.319
As we know, when he was just seventeen years old, his life turned completely upside down.

00:03:52.319 --> 00:04:02.319
Out of jealousy, his brothers sold him into slavery, and then as a result of the treachery of his master's wife, he found himself in the situation we see on our screens.

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.319
In an Egyptian prison, he endured years of unjust imprisonment.

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:14.319
During that time, would he feel cut off from his reward or would he remain faithful?

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.319
Let's read about it together.

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.319
Please turn with me to Genesis, chapter 39.

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:21.319
Genesis 39.

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:27.660
And notice what happened with Joseph in verses 21 through 23.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:36.660
But Jehovah continued with Joseph and kept showing loyal love to him and granting him favor in the eyes of the chief officer of the prison.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.660
So the chief officer of the prison put Joseph in charge of all the prisoners in the prison.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.660
And everything that they were doing there, he was the one having it done.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.660
The chief officer of the prison was looking after absolutely nothing that was in Joseph's care.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:58.660
For Jehovah was with Joseph and Jehovah made whatever he did successful.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.660
So evidently, Joseph didn't give into discouragement.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.660
He did his work the best he could and he focused on his relationship with Jehovah.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:13.660
As we see in this image, Jehovah rewarded him even in this difficult situation.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:21.660
Years later, Pharaoh released Joseph from prison and he made this humble slave, the second ruler in all of Egypt.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.660
Another reward for Joseph's faithfulness.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.660
Did Joseph recognize Jehovah as his rewarder?

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:35.899
Well, turned to chapter 41 and notice verses 51 and 52.

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:37.899
41, 51, 52.

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:40.899
Joseph named the first born Manasseh.

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:44.899
For he said, God has made me forget all my troubles and all the house of my father.

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:46.899
And he named the second one Ephraim.

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:50.899
For he said, God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:55.899
So yes, Joseph recognized it was Jehovah who rewarded him.

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:59.899
But Joseph's example can help us if we had a difficult childhood.

00:05:59.899 --> 00:06:04.899
If we're going through a difficult time right now, we too can remain faithful.

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:07.899
We can stay contented and we can persevere.

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:10.899
If we do, Jehovah will reward us now and in the future.

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:13.899
The key is to remain faithful.

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:17.149
Well, that brings us to our final point.

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:20.149
What are some rewards we receive from our loving God?

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:21.149
There are so many.

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:22.149
Let's mention just a few.

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:25.149
Perhaps we'll start with just a few present rewards.

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:30.149
I thought our book organized to do Jehovah's will describes beautifully one reward.

00:06:30.149 --> 00:06:32.149
Notice how it put it.

00:06:32.149 --> 00:06:40.149
All who are associated with the congregation of God today can rejoice in the rich spiritual estate that Jehovah's given to his people.

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:47.149
Our spiritual pastures are indeed lush and we have an abundance of refreshing waters of truth.

00:06:47.149 --> 00:06:51.149
Yes, we enjoy that spiritual estate, don't we?

00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:56.149
Jehovah also rewards us now by letting us be part of a loving brotherhood,

00:06:56.149 --> 00:07:00.149
spiritual fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, and children.

00:07:00.149 --> 00:07:04.149
That's similar to the reward that Jesus mentioned to his disciples.

00:07:04.149 --> 00:07:06.149
And one final present reward.

00:07:06.149 --> 00:07:13.149
Our faithfulness is rewarded with the incomparable blessings of peace of mind, contentment, and happiness.

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:15.149
One sister stated,

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:21.149
I cannot thank Jehovah enough for helping me with my worries and for being at my side each day.

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:24.149
The world out there is chaotic and bleak.

00:07:24.149 --> 00:07:28.149
But as I work closely with Jehovah, I feel secure in his arms.

00:07:28.149 --> 00:07:35.149
Whenever I make personal sacrifices for him, he gives me back a hundredfold in blessings.

00:07:35.149 --> 00:07:38.149
This sister could see her rewarder.

00:07:38.149 --> 00:07:40.149
And what about our future rewards?

00:07:40.149 --> 00:07:45.149
Well, if Spirit anointed Christians remained faithful, 2 Timothy 4, 7, and 8 mentions

00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:52.149
that they'll receive the crown of righteousness which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give as a reward.

00:07:52.149 --> 00:07:54.149
And what about those of us with an earthly hope?

00:07:54.149 --> 00:07:59.149
We eagerly anticipate the reward of everlasting life on a paradise earth

00:07:59.149 --> 00:08:04.149
when the words of Isaiah 32-17 will be fulfilled that speak about peace

00:08:04.149 --> 00:08:08.149
and lasting tranquility and security.

00:08:08.149 --> 00:08:10.149
The awake one stated,

00:08:10.149 --> 00:08:17.149
healthy people under perfect conditions will be able to produce whatever is needed to make life enjoyable.

00:08:17.149 --> 00:08:23.149
Yes, Jehovah delights to reward his faithful servants now, and he'll do so in the future.

00:08:23.149 --> 00:08:25.149
So what have we considered?

00:08:25.149 --> 00:08:29.149
How can we be sure that Jehovah wants to reward his faithful servants?

00:08:29.149 --> 00:08:35.149
Well, texts such as Hebrews 11-6 and Matthew 1927-29 confirm

00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:39.149
that Jehovah takes the initiative to reward his faithful servants.

00:08:39.149 --> 00:08:41.149
How did he do so in the past?

00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:45.149
As an example, we considered the example of Joseph.

00:08:45.149 --> 00:08:51.149
Jehovah rewarded his faith during his trial and afterwards.

00:08:51.149 --> 00:08:54.149
And what are some rewards we receive from our loving God?

00:08:54.149 --> 00:08:57.149
He's rewarding our rich spiritual estate.

00:08:57.149 --> 00:09:00.149
He allows us to be part of that international brotherhood

00:09:00.149 --> 00:09:04.149
and he provides us peace of mind, contentment, and happiness.

00:09:04.149 --> 00:09:07.149
And what future rewards we look forward to enjoying,

00:09:07.149 --> 00:09:09.149
life in the heavens for the anointed

00:09:09.149 --> 00:09:13.149
and everlasting life here on the earth for the other sheep.

00:09:13.149 --> 00:09:18.149
How grateful we are that Jehovah rewards his faithful servants.
