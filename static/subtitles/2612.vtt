I think sexual harassment is anything that makes you feel uncomfortable.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.940
Maybe somebody touching you a certain way when you didn't really give them any reason

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.940
why they should feel comfortable doing that.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.940
Putting yourself in their way constantly when that person has already expressed

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:40.210
that they don't want you doing that to them.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.210
Sexual harassment isn't just something that people can do to you,

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.210
but it's also what they can say.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:57.210
It's just something that makes you feel uncomfortable, insecure, or like they're in danger.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.210
Definitely I'll be uncomfortable when someone comes up to me and touches me

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.209
or even my hand if I don't know why you touch me.

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:15.379
You can invite sexual harassment without meaning to if you dress in a certain way

00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:20.379
or if you act a certain way.

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:23.379
If she says stop but she's smiling while she says it,

00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:26.379
he can not only have the impression that she's flirting but he can have the impression

00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:28.379
she's playing hard to get.

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:36.739
Her not telling him to leave her alone is conveying to him that she does enjoy

00:01:36.739 --> 00:01:40.739
the sexual harassment and he will push it further to means that she doesn't like

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:42.739
and means that she doesn't want.

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:47.739
If they constantly feel that they can touch you or speak to you in a certain way,

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:54.739
then you have no obligation to continue spending time with them.

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:58.739
You have to listen to yourself and as soon as you feel uncomfortable with something,

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:01.739
you have to let someone know sternly because maybe they're not even aware

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:03.739
that they're making you feel uncomfortable.
