00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:06.700
We can say that the theme of the Book of Romans is really about unity.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.939
It's a marvelous example of how to break down barriers, how to break down prejudice.

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:19.500
Now you'll recall that there was bad blood in the Christian congregation between the Jews

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.339
and the Romans.

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:25.859
Some of the Jews thought they were better than anyone else because of circumcision and

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.660
because of their religious background.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.659
And Paul doesn't just say to the Jews and the Romans, well you know you're all equal

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:34.619
in God's sight.

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:36.619
He goes further.

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:39.539
And his argument is masterful.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:48.740
Let's turn to Romans 2, 28 and 29, and see how Paul handles this very thorny problem.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:56.549
Romans chapter 2 verses 28 and 29.

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:03.390
For he is not a Jew who is one on the outside, nor is circumcision something on the outside

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.349
on the flesh, but he is a Jew who is one on the inside.

00:01:08.349 --> 00:01:15.549
And his circumcision is that of the heart by spirit and not by a written code.

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.870
That person's praise comes from God, not from people.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.790
Well now what's Paul's argument?

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.870
Paul is saying you're all of the anointed, so you are all Jews.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.709
You are all spiritual Israelites.

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:37.310
And what's more, you are all circumcised.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.310
And that includes you sisters, he says, because you're of the anointed and you have been

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.829
circumcised in the heart by Holy Spirit.

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:52.909
So then that gives a weight to what Paul had written to the Galatians when he said there

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:59.109
is neither male nor female, there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:00.109
Friedman.

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:06.709
So he is completely breaking down the barriers by saying you are all one in Jesus Christ.

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:11.909
Now some of the verses that we love to quote in the book of Romans actually promote the

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:17.469
idea of unity, the fact that there is no distinction between one race and another.

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:25.949
For example, Romans 3.23 all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:33.629
Romans 5.12 through one man, our common ancestor Adam, sin, anointed of the world and death

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.030
through sin.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.509
Well why was Paul so insistent on the need for unity?

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:46.270
Perhaps he didn't know at the time, but Jehovah knew.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.069
Paul wrote his letter in 56 CE.

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.629
Now what was the situation in Rome at the time?

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:59.469
The emperor Claudius, the one who had expelled all the Jews from Rome, had died, and a new

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:06.909
emperor, a very promising one, had taken the throne, Nero.

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:13.710
Now it may seem strange to say that Nero was a very promising emperor, but historians

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:19.430
tell us that during the first five years of his reign, Nero was a very good emperor.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.949
In fact, the Roman historian, contemporary historian, Gaeus Sutonius, had this to say,

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:30.870
Nero started off with a parade of virtue.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.909
He never missed an opportunity of being generous or merciful.

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:40.830
If he could not abolish some of the heavier taxes, he lowered them.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.430
They have asked to sign a death warrant for a convicted felon.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.110
He would sigh, ah, how I wish I had never learned to write.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:57.990
Once when the senate passed a vote of thanks to him, he answered, wait until I deserve them.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.789
And the fact is that Nero was popular with the poor right up to his death.

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:07.789
Now incidentally, it would have been during that five-year period that the Apostle Paul

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:13.949
told Philemon that he was optimistic of being released when he appeared before Nero.

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:17.750
It appears that Paul thought that Nero would have been fair.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.149
And Nero did have a background in law.

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:26.829
Nero had actually fought cases, argued cases before the courts in his youth.

00:04:26.829 --> 00:04:30.540
So what's the point?

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.620
Although in private, Nero was debauched in public, he was very good.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.579
He was a solid emperor.

00:04:36.579 --> 00:04:40.500
And the Christians may have thought that they were going to enter into a period of peace.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.019
Here is a man who was fair.

00:04:42.019 --> 00:04:43.379
Here is a man who was just.

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:46.980
Here is a man who doesn't like putting people to death.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.180
What a mistake that would have been.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:56.459
Now in his letter, Paul sends greetings to more than 26 men and women in Rome.

00:04:56.459 --> 00:05:08.980
And in one way, it makes us sad to read the list, Mary, Andronicus, Junius, Urbinaus,

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.019
Rufus.

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:17.500
Knowing as we do that eight years later, many of them would be dead, mulled to death by

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.300
wild dogs or burned alive in Nero's gardens.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:29.459
It makes Paul's words recorded at Romans 8, 17 almost chilling to read, where Paul says

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:37.100
provided that we suffer together so that we may be glorified together.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.459
Those Christians in Rome were going to suffer together.

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:46.699
And Paul, right along with them in Rome, about a year after the rest of them, and wouldn't

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:53.980
have been a pity if those Christians were united only in death but never in life.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.220
They needed to learn to love one another so that when faced with death, someone didn't

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:05.019
say, I really don't know if this is the truth because there's a lack of love in the congregation.

00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:08.819
Well who have applied Paul's counsel today?

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:11.220
The Catholic Church?

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:18.540
In World War II, in the city of Rome, there were Jews, and there were Romans.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.019
How did the Romans treat the Jews?

00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:31.860
The Vatican and Pius, Italian Catholics, looked silently by, while 7,500 Jews were hauled

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.620
off to the concentration camps in Auschwitz.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:40.500
They never said a word and few returned alive.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:46.500
Now what a contrast with Jehovah's people who have risked their lives on behalf of fellow

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:51.899
believers in many countries, no matter what their race, no matter what their nationality,

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:58.300
doesn't make you feel good to belong to an organization where there truly are no foreigners.
