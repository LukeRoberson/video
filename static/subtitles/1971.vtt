00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:23.940
If my patient does not accept transfusions, regardless of whether he is one of the always

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:30.179
witnesses or not, in fact that is not the point, I must think of an alternative method.

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.179
There is no uniform standard.

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:37.060
We can't say this patient does not accept transfusions, therefore it does not want to

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.060
be treated.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.299
It depends on the type of illness and on its condition.

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:56.219
It depends on when the patient comes to us and several factors a doctor needs to consider.

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:03.219
It is certainly possible to treat tumors such as lymphoma, acute as well as other types

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:10.260
of leukemias, a myeloma, a disease that is only increased in the Western world without

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:23.459
blood transfusions.

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:29.459
It is not possible to say that he died for that reason, rather we can say that the primary

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:34.280
cause was bleeding.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:43.370
The secondary cause may be that anemia affected the heart, its functionality.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:49.569
The third cause may be that not everything was done to implement and adequate treatment

00:01:49.569 --> 00:02:00.230
in such a situation.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.230
It depends.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.870
It's extremely verbal.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.189
Now we have hospitalized a young man who was in a globing value is four.

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.789
An old told at rest, he tolerates the condition well, but there might be another patient who,

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:18.150
for instance, has a heart condition that he tolerates with difficulty, so it isn't possible

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.110
to evaluate situations in the same way.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.150
There are therapeutic protocols that doctors usually follow, but in my view, these rules

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.229
could be rewritten.
