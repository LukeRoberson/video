00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:07.160
Welcome to JW Broadcasting. This month we look to fortify our desire for

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:13.679
spiritual food from Jehovah. Here are the highlights of what's ahead. What tools

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.600
do we have to discover spiritual treasures and how can we use them effectively?

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.960
We'll find the answers in this how-to video. Our congregations are places of

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.219
theocratic instruction where qualified men are needed to serve and

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:35.700
shepherd. How does this brother learn what it really means to reach out? And this

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.159
touching music video will highlight the joys experienced at the 2014

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:45.640
international conventions. But it will also cause us to look forward to the

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.560
spiritual feast at our next convention which will be here before we know it.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:01:15.959
This is the December edition of JW Broadcasting. Theocratic schools are

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:20.000
equipping more and more of our brothers and sisters with a strong spiritual

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.159
foundation. After graduation they're able to fill needed assignments in the

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.480
organization. For example the school for Kingdom evangelizers is training

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.959
ones who make themselves available to serve where the harvest is great often

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:39.920
within their own branch territory. That's the situation in the Democratic

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.359
Republic of Congo where over one million people attended last year's

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:49.840
memorial. That's more than five times the number of publishers because of this

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.319
tremendous need in the field and the lack of other facilities to conduct

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:59.079
theocratic schools and house the students. An exception was made to have a

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:04.359
dedicated school facility. Now things are different after a busy

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:11.509
renovation and an exciting dedication program. In the very heart of Africa lies

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:17.110
the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of Congo. Jehovah's

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.389
creation brings praise to him. However the greatest shout-out to praise to

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:25.389
Jehovah comes from the more than 200,000 Jehovah's Witnesses who are

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:30.949
zealously preaching and teaching the good news of the Kingdom. In our branch

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:38.270
territory over 40,000 were baptized in the last three years. This means the

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.469
formation of many new congregations. This accelerated growth produces a need

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:50.229
for more qualified brothers and sisters. We needed a school facility that could

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:55.310
satisfy this growing need. Due to economic reasons and a great number of

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.069
potential students in the Congo the governing body made a loving exception and

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.990
decided that we could have a school for Kingdom of Lunch Lodge with two

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.590
classrooms. We were so happy when we received the approval to go ahead and

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.430
renovate some buildings located near to Bethel. International and local

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.349
volunteers went very hard to renovate the buildings into a theocratic school

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:23.830
complex that would bring praise to Jehovah God. This school's complex is unique

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.669
because it's an oasis of order and cleanliness in an overcrowded city. One day a

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:33.870
passerby got a glimpse of the school because the gates were left open. He was so

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.870
impressed with the well-maintained buildings, the beautiful garden setting and the

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.629
sign Bible school's complex. He came right in and asked if he could enroll in

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:47.550
the school. On January the 17th, 2015, Brother Garrett Lodge of the

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.389
governing body dedicated the complex to Jehovah with the theme growth praises

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:57.270
Jehovah. I would never have thought this could happen 15 years ago that a

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.069
member of the governing body would come to dedicate this building that has been

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:08.069
used for many things but now the pinnacle of school. We are very happy Jehovah is

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:14.030
really the creator. 51 students were invited from all over Congo for the first and

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.949
second classes of the school for Kingdom Evangelises. For many of the students it

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:22.949
is the first time to see a theocratic school facility of Bethel for that

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:29.149
matter. I couldn't believe my eyes when Jehovah granted me one of the

00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:37.069
desires of my heart to attend the school for Kingdom Evangelises. In Isaiah 54

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:44.629
13 the Bible says every son will be taught by Jehovah. I felt very privileged to

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:49.389
have been chosen by the branch committee to learn more about Jehovah and his

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:55.069
organization. The students will never forget that they enjoyed three good

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:59.389
mules served to them graciously each day, that their clothes were washed and

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.990
well pressed, that they enjoyed a modern air-conditioned classroom in the

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.949
tropics with computers and printers freely available for their use, also that

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:14.269
they slept in safety at night in clean rooms. Do you have the spirit of an

00:05:14.269 --> 00:05:21.470
evangeliser? We believe that you do have it. In general, secular school education

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.430
can make people more proud. This divine education helps the students to be more

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:33.990
humble and thus more useful in Jehovah's hands. I understand Bethel now how much

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:41.589
Jehovah appreciates humble people but he opposes the proud. I am very small at

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:48.589
the bottom of dust. So there is no need for me to think I am better than someone else.

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:53.829
The training helped me to look at myself honestly. I discovered parts of my

00:05:53.829 --> 00:06:03.629
personality I needed to improve. I have the privilege to take care of this

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:10.389
school complex. I saw the quality of divine education with my own eyes. Now I am

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:15.069
motivated to try even harder to make the experience pleasant for any future

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:21.709
students and thus bring praise to Jehovah. It helped me to cherish my place in

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:26.110
Jehovah's organization to love Jehovah and my brothers and sisters even more.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:35.029
The school helps the students not just to help new ones but also to work along

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:42.949
with the other publishers so they also can progress and stabilize in the faith.

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:48.829
I make a new foot to show the training with others in the congregation. I like

00:06:48.829 --> 00:06:54.589
to encourage the young one to take up the pioneer service. With the training I

00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:59.269
received I found it easier to approach anyone. I'm conducting several

00:06:59.269 --> 00:07:06.149
Bible studies and some of them are attending meetings. The divine education that

00:07:06.149 --> 00:07:10.670
I received helped me to have a clearer understanding of the truth. I am also

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.269
much more effective in my ministry.

00:07:14.269 --> 00:07:20.389
Deborah and Kathy were assigned to a distant isolated territory 1,500

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:26.189
kilometers up the River Congo in northern Congo. In the congregation the

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:29.470
brothers was surprised because they know usually the school we sent out

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:35.790
brothers but it was two sisters but now they see that we help the congregation.

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:40.750
Yes, we were very happy when our second overseer informed us that two

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:45.470
sisters were coming to our congregation. We were very happy. They encourage

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:49.790
other sisters in the congregation. Also, they add enthusiasm to the

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:55.470
congregation especially in the ministry. The presence of these

00:07:55.470 --> 00:08:00.509
graduates in the various congregations has helped to improve the quality of

00:08:00.509 --> 00:08:06.670
teaching and energize the preaching activity. The benefits reached the far

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:12.589
corners of Congo so that a great shot of praise is given to your hope.

00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:17.470
Water blessing from Jehovah every year more than 200

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:21.389
brothers and sisters can receive divine education from Jehovah and then

00:08:21.389 --> 00:08:33.279
express this over the far reaching territory of the Congo branch.

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:38.559
How encouraging it is to see the school for kingdom evangelizers in Congo is now

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:44.240
able to move forward with Jehovah's blessing but you and I can benefit from

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:49.519
deep spiritual study even if we're not enrolled in a special school.

00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:53.360
That's because we all have something special that Jehovah gives to us on a

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:59.600
regular basis. Now let's discuss what that is and how we can use it.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.120
Did you notice the nutritious meals that were provided for the students

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.519
similar to the meals served at Bethel? In order to feed our hard working

00:09:07.519 --> 00:09:11.919
Bethel families throughout the world thousands of meals are prepared each day.

00:09:11.919 --> 00:09:16.799
Needless to say much work goes into this food preparation but this isn't the

00:09:16.799 --> 00:09:21.360
only food being prepared at Bethel. There is a banquet of rich

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:26.159
dishes and fine wine that we call spiritual food.

00:09:26.159 --> 00:09:30.960
The real source of such food is Jehovah because it is based solidly on his

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:36.879
inspired word. But how do we show our appreciation for this food?

00:09:36.879 --> 00:09:41.759
Let's find out. Let's open our Bibles now to Proverbs chapter 2 and we're going

00:09:41.759 --> 00:09:48.320
to read verses 1 through 4. Proverbs 2, 1 through 4.

00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:54.159
My son, if you accept my sayings and treasure up my commandments

00:09:54.159 --> 00:09:59.759
by making your ear attentive to wisdom and inclining your heart to discernment.

00:09:59.759 --> 00:10:05.919
Moreover, if you call out for understanding and raise your voice for discernment,

00:10:05.919 --> 00:10:10.879
if you keep seeking for it as for silver and you keep searching for it as for hidden

00:10:10.879 --> 00:10:17.840
treasures, notice that Jehovah does not force feed us spiritual food.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.039
But he appeals to our free will.

00:10:21.039 --> 00:10:25.120
If we showed Jehovah we are eager to receive his teachings,

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.840
if we put forth the effort, if we keep seeking and searching,

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:36.799
consider the reward we receive the key to unlock the hidden treasures and

00:10:36.799 --> 00:10:42.240
find the knowledge of God. But if we're to find the knowledge of

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.320
God and to grow spiritually and become mature Christians,

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:51.360
we must know how to study. Therefore, in this program,

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:57.120
we're going to share five ways to help us get the most out of our study.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:04.159
Now, the first point is in verse 1. Proverbs chapter 2 and verse 1.

00:11:04.159 --> 00:11:13.279
My son, if you accept my sayings. Now, the majority of our viewers agree with us when we say that

00:11:13.279 --> 00:11:18.159
the Bible is no ordinary book. We accept it as it is, the Word of God.

00:11:19.039 --> 00:11:26.000
Now, we may say we accept the Bible's teachings, but does our life show that we accept it?

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.279
Do we allow it to shape and mold our lives? Much depends on our attitude.

00:11:32.879 --> 00:11:36.799
Our attitude toward accepting and applying the Word of God is like a valve.

00:11:37.679 --> 00:11:42.480
It can either impede or increase the flow of Holy Spirit.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.799
During your study periods, open that valve wide, allow the Bible into your life.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:55.679
Then God's Word can affect you profoundly. You will see changes in your life that only the

00:11:55.679 --> 00:12:03.120
power of the Bible truth can bring about. Think about how accepting Jehovah's ways is

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:09.600
saving you from a bad course as stated at Proverbs chapter 2 and verse 11 and 12.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:15.360
Let's illustrate how this works when we do our Bible reading.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:21.360
Open your Bible to Deuteronomy chapter 17 and verse 16.

00:12:22.159 --> 00:12:27.200
Now, we're going to use this verse to make all five points come alive.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:35.200
Now, try to picture yourself in this verse. You are a king over the nation of Israel.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:45.289
You are surrounded by powerful nations. Let's read the verse, verse 16, Deuteronomy 17.

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:54.330
However, he, now that's you, should not acquire many horses for himself or make the people go

00:12:54.330 --> 00:13:02.090
back to Egypt in order to obtain more horses. Few horses for the king. That means no Calvary

00:13:02.169 --> 00:13:08.090
in the battlefield to a war strategist that might have sounded like terrible advice. Horses

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:12.889
were mighty weapons of war. This is where thinking ability comes in.

00:13:14.169 --> 00:13:21.370
How will obeying this command save the nation from a bad course? Would you accept this as the word

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:28.649
of God? You would if you applied our second point as mentioned in Proverbs chapter 2 1 B.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:39.610
Now, it says Proverbs chapter 2 1 B and treasure up my commandments. Now millions believe

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:46.409
the Bible is God's word, but they don't treasure it. What makes us different? We realize that every

00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:52.169
word from Jehovah is of value. We see the positive results when we apply what we learn.

00:13:53.129 --> 00:13:55.929
As Proverbs chapter 2 and verse 10 states,

00:13:56.809 --> 00:14:04.409
when wisdom enters your heart and knowledge becomes pleasant to your soul, wisdom enters our

00:14:04.409 --> 00:14:11.610
heart and motivates us when you treasure God's precious sayings and experience the beneficial effect

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:17.289
they have on you personally. Then you become more convinced of the rightness of Jehovah's way of

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:25.690
doing things. His sayings really are something to treasure. So what treasure can we glean from

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:35.370
Deuteronomy 1716? No horses, no Calvary? When they obeyed that command, Israel had no national chariot

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:42.570
force. But what did they have? They had victory after victory. They defeated 31 Canaanite nations

00:14:42.649 --> 00:14:47.610
greater than them. They took control of the promised land. They received the fulfillment of God's

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:56.090
promises without a chariot force. Do you see the treasure in that? The third point we want to discuss

00:14:56.090 --> 00:15:06.159
is in verse 2 which says, by making your ear attentive to wisdom, we want to make our ear

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:14.559
attentive to wisdom. How do we do that? After reading God's word, listen. Listen by looking for life

00:15:14.559 --> 00:15:22.000
application principles. Faith involves more than just reading a statement. It will result in action.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:30.559
So as you meditate on God's word, try to single out specific lessons and ask yourself, how can I apply

00:15:30.639 --> 00:15:44.110
this? Let's go back to our example of Deuteronomy 1716. Solomon read Deuteronomy 1716, but did he really

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:51.230
listen? No, he multiplied horses. In fact, he built whole cities to house and support his chariot

00:15:51.230 --> 00:16:00.269
forces. Now what about us? How are we doing? Are we just reading or are we listening? In other words,

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:07.149
we may ask ourselves, what action in my life would indicate to Jehovah that I am trusting him more

00:16:07.149 --> 00:16:15.070
fully? Is my ear attentive? Solomon was one of the wisest men who ever lived. He wrote the words

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:21.149
we've been discussing in Proverbs chapter 2. So why didn't he apply them? Why didn't he make his

00:16:21.149 --> 00:16:29.789
ear attentive to Jehovah's directive in Deuteronomy? Why did he accumulate horses? Because he did not

00:16:29.789 --> 00:16:42.590
apply .4. You recall Proverbs chapter 2, 2b, it says, and inclining your heart to discernment.

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:50.909
Later in life, the problem was not Solomon's reading ability. He was a smart man, but his heart

00:16:51.789 --> 00:16:59.549
deep down, it seems he thought his way was better as we make our ear attentive. We will find

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:06.029
things we need to change. Studying with the goal of making personal application will challenge us

00:17:06.029 --> 00:17:14.990
to our core. When we discover we are not doing things Jehovah's way, will our heart move us to

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:27.369
discern Jehovah's will? Before starting each study session, we must ask him to incline our heart

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:35.450
to see what is needed to give us the strength to do things his way. For example, ask yourself,

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:41.930
if I had been Solomon, would I have acted in harmony with what is stated at Deuteronomy 1716?

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:50.089
If you are not inclined to agree, would your heart or your feelings move you to discern if there

00:17:50.089 --> 00:17:58.490
was a deeper reason for Jehovah to set this regulation? Search your heart now. Do you honestly believe

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:04.890
Jehovah would require something that would put his people in danger? Will you incline your heart to

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:13.769
seek the lesson behind his requirement? For example, let's go back to the prohibition at Deuteronomy 1716.

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:21.849
Think of David Solomon's father when facing an ammonite and Syrian army of 32,000 chariots.

00:18:22.569 --> 00:18:29.769
Did it make any sense for David not to have a cavalry of his own? Imagine now that you are a

00:18:29.769 --> 00:18:36.650
foot soldier in the Israelite army. All you have is a sword and a shield. Would you have questioned

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:43.769
the king's decision? Would you discern that this really was best for the nation? Yes, because you

00:18:43.769 --> 00:18:49.450
accepted God's word. You treasured it up. You made your ear attentive. You incline your heart. You

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:55.609
follow through. That's why you're there. Imagine, as you draw up in the battle formation against such a

00:18:55.609 --> 00:19:02.410
formidable enemy. You see the horses, nostrils flaring. You can taste the dust kicked up by the 32,000

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:07.369
chariots. You hear the war cry of these mighty warriors. How do you feel? Nervous?

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:14.490
The account recorded at 1 Chronicles 19 says that against all odds, the enemies turned around

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:23.049
and fled. The lesson, despite any human tendency to doubt or rationalize, you clearly see that

00:19:23.049 --> 00:19:29.930
following Jehovah's way is always the best, the surest way for our protection and prosperity.

00:19:32.319 --> 00:19:39.279
When we experience Jehovah's saving hand in our lives and we see how he wants to benefit us,

00:19:39.279 --> 00:19:45.839
we're hooked. Our hearts are touched and we want more of that in our lives. We've seen the value

00:19:45.839 --> 00:19:52.480
of these precious truths that makes us look forward to our study. We can't wait to keep digging.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:20:04.220
Let's read verse 4 and highlight our fifth point. If you keep seeking for it as for silver and

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:12.700
you keep searching for it as for hidden treasures. When we seek and search for more details,

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:21.900
we find the key to unlock hidden treasures. For example, let us seek more details on Deuteronomy 1716.

00:20:22.859 --> 00:20:27.420
Was there any practical reason for the Israelites not to employ horses in battle?

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:35.500
Pull out our tools, look at our map and the good land brochure. Israel's largely a hilly country.

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:41.019
A cavalry is most effective in flat, open low planes, not on hills and mountains.

00:20:42.059 --> 00:20:47.980
Might that fact have led some to draw the wrong conclusions about Jehovah's ability to save

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:54.700
his people? Digging deeper, using our research publications gives us more details.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:21:02.059
Insight volume 1 under the heading chariot reveals that the enemies of Jehovah try to lure his

00:21:02.059 --> 00:21:08.779
people to fight on flat land. As first kings chapter 20 makes clear, they thought Jehovah's a God

00:21:08.779 --> 00:21:15.660
of mountains. Really, Jehovah can only fight in the mountains? The great defeat, those enemies

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:26.960
suffered proved that are Almighty God is also a God of planes. What was the main reason for victory

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:33.039
in the battle? Horses and cavalry, the terrain or Jehovah? The answer is obvious.

00:21:34.319 --> 00:21:39.920
Because of your seeking and searching, you have found a treasure most of the world doesn't even know

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:48.799
exists. You now understand what Proverbs 25 calls the fear of Jehovah. At the conclusion of a study

00:21:48.799 --> 00:21:55.839
session, thank Jehovah for the treasure of his word. Like a child eager to relate every detail to

00:21:55.839 --> 00:22:04.000
a parent, tell Jehovah what you learn from your Bible study. Ask him to help you apply his teachings

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:11.920
in your life. Use our five points from Proverbs 2 to help build an appetite for the banquet of

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:21.759
rich dishes and fine wine our Father has lovingly provided. Let's review one. First, we want to

00:22:21.759 --> 00:22:28.880
accept God's word. Adjust the valve of our attitude and allow Jehovah's precious thoughts to mold

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:37.759
and shape our life. Two, we treasure up Jehovah's sayings. We do this when we acknowledge the beneficial

00:22:37.759 --> 00:22:46.160
effect God sayings have on us personally. Three, we discuss the importance of making our year

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:53.119
attentive. This happens when we sing aloud specific lessons and act to apply them in our life.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:23:00.720
Our fourth point, emphasize the need to incline our hearts toward discernment. We do this

00:23:01.279 --> 00:23:07.519
by begging Jehovah to give us the strength to do things his way and to live in a way

00:23:07.519 --> 00:23:14.480
that makes his heart rejoice. Our fifth point encouraged us to keep seeking and searching by

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:22.160
digging deeper using our research publications to glean even more details. These are just a few

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:28.480
ways to enhance our appreciation for spiritual food. Now is the time to deepen our knowledge and

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:36.880
fortify our faith. May we heed Jesus' counsel to work for the food that is spiritual food that remains

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:44.750
forever lasting life. It's vital that each of us know how to find spiritual food, whether it's

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:51.470
through a library of books, a computer, or a handheld device. But the availability of spiritual food

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:58.670
is not enough. We must also learn how to make effective use of the tools we have. Pay close

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:06.190
attention and be reminded of how three of our research tools can be used when we need to find spiritual

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:27.240
treasures. As Jehovah's people, we often find ourselves in situations that may require us to do

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:37.069
research. For example, isn't that a lovely thought? But personally, I pray to the saints.

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:41.630
They really do help me. What do you think about praying to the saints?

00:24:42.829 --> 00:24:46.910
That's a really interesting question. I know we have some information on that.

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:50.829
Perhaps I could come back in a couple of days and we could discuss that together.

00:24:54.759 --> 00:25:05.079
Open up your textbooks, turn to page 26. And we all know that evolution is a trusted scientific theory.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:09.400
And it is well supported by the fossil records.

00:25:22.109 --> 00:25:26.589
How to identify the true religion? Where do I start?

00:25:27.549 --> 00:25:32.990
At times like these, what are some basic research techniques that can help us?

00:25:34.029 --> 00:25:36.990
Let's take a look at our available research tools.

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:44.109
Watchtower Library. Research Guide and Watchtower Online Library.

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:52.109
And the JW Library app. Each of these has unique features that can help us in a variety of ways.

00:25:55.079 --> 00:26:02.279
The Watchtower Library program is very easy to use. Simply type in a word in the search field.

00:26:03.559 --> 00:26:07.480
And you will see a vast amount of references listed for that subject.

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:13.799
If you wish to see the very latest information, simply click on the Year tab.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:22.279
Or for easier viewing, you can categorize all the references by clicking on the category tab at the bottom.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:27.960
A nice feature of this tool is that you don't need an internet connection to access it.

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:51.099
Have you had a chance to use our research guide?

00:26:53.769 --> 00:26:58.569
While this tool doesn't list every subject that has been discussed in our publications,

00:26:59.369 --> 00:27:03.529
the topics that are listed contain the most current references.

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:10.490
Each topic links you directly to the appropriate article on the Watchtower Online Library.

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:16.009
If you wanted to do an additional search using Watchtower Online Library,

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:22.890
simply click on the Watchtower symbol in the upper left hand corner and enter your desired topic.

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:40.509
A great mobile research tool is our JW Library app.

00:27:42.349 --> 00:27:47.710
Under the Publications tab, it has a growing number of publications and videos to choose from.

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:54.589
Each of these can be downloaded to your mobile device for quick offline access.

00:27:55.710 --> 00:28:00.589
But suppose you're thinking of a specific scripture and can't remember the exact verse.

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:09.549
No problem. The JW Library app can help again. Navigate to the search icon shown on the homepage

00:28:09.549 --> 00:28:16.750
and type in a keyword. To refine the search, multiple keywords can be entered.

00:28:19.049 --> 00:28:26.809
Yes, young and old can take advantage of these excellent research tools to help find satisfying

00:28:26.809 --> 00:28:33.289
answers. Improving our ability to do research strengthens our relationship with Jehovah,

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:39.529
so that we may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.

00:28:40.809 --> 00:28:44.009
So let's make good use of our research tools.

00:28:47.279 --> 00:28:50.799
Did you see something that could help you in your spiritual studies?

00:28:51.839 --> 00:28:57.839
As an example, why not use the research guide in the Watchtower Online Library for an answer

00:28:57.839 --> 00:29:03.519
to your question? As evidence of Jehovah's love, and ever increasing number of our brothers

00:29:03.519 --> 00:29:10.240
have these study tools in their own language, Watchtower Library on CD-ROM was first released

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:18.559
back in 1994, and it can be requested today in over 55 languages. Watchtower Online Library

00:29:18.559 --> 00:29:23.359
has been on the internet since 2012 and has grown to over 200 languages.

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:30.160
And JW Library, which was first announced for English at the 2013 annual meeting,

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:37.839
contains printed publications in more than 150 languages and audio video programs in over 590.

00:29:37.839 --> 00:29:46.400
Earlier, we discussed how to follow the steps in Proverbs chapter 2 to find the knowledge of God

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:52.480
so beneficial to us. The anointed brothers who make up the faithful and discrete slave

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:56.880
said a wonderful example of how to personally search through God's Word.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:03.359
In this Bethel morning worship, Brother David Spleen shares lessons that we can learn and apply

00:30:03.359 --> 00:30:11.680
for a study of the lives of Isaac and Rebecca. Let's open our Bibles and read the text directly

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:22.640
from the Bible because there's more to it. Genesis 24 and verse 67. And as we read this,

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:30.000
what we're looking for is a clue into Isaac's personality. Let's see what we can find out about Isaac

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:38.400
from verse 67. It says after that, Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah, his mother,

00:30:39.599 --> 00:30:49.599
thus he took Rebecca as his wife, and he fell in love with her, and Isaac found comfort

00:30:49.680 --> 00:31:01.200
after the loss of his mother. So what clue do we have into Isaac's personality? He's obviously a man

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:13.119
who has feelings. This is a man of sentiment. Now how long had Sarah been dead when Isaac got married?

00:31:14.079 --> 00:31:25.759
Do the math. Sarah was 90 when Isaac was born. She was 127 when she died. So how old was Isaac when

00:31:25.759 --> 00:31:38.160
Sarah died? 37. Now he's 40. Three years have passed, and his sorrow is so great that the Bible

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:47.359
makes special mention of the fact that he found comfort over the death of his mother. So Sarah's

00:31:47.359 --> 00:31:55.039
death obviously hit Isaac hard. And then it says that he fell in love with his wife. Now how would

00:31:55.039 --> 00:32:05.599
the writer of Genesis know all this? Obviously Isaac shared his feelings unlike some men. Now from what

00:32:05.599 --> 00:32:11.759
we know of Rebecca, we can easily understand why Isaac would fall in love with her. Brother

00:32:11.759 --> 00:32:18.559
Verges referred briefly to the situation that brought them together. Remember the oldest servant

00:32:18.559 --> 00:32:23.599
of Abraham? They think it was Ellie Yeezer, and for simplicity we'll call him Ellie Yeezer.

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:34.079
Abraham asks Ellie Yeezer to go to the city of Nehor to pick out a wife for Isaac. Now

00:32:34.079 --> 00:32:40.960
Ellie Yeezer doesn't lean on his own discernment, his own judgment. He prays to Jehovah and he asks

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:49.599
Jehovah for help. And he says now the woman who offers not only to give me a drink, but who is

00:32:49.599 --> 00:32:57.519
willing to water my ten camels, let her be the one whom you have chosen for Isaac. And so he makes

00:32:57.519 --> 00:33:11.680
the trip to the city of Nehor. Enter Rebecca. She has a water jar on her shoulder. And she not only

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:20.000
offers to give Ellie Yeezer a drink, but she also offers to water his ten camels. Now think about

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:32.220
what's involved. Let's turn to Genesis 24 and read verses 19 and 20. Genesis 24, 19 and 20.

00:33:34.519 --> 00:33:42.839
When she finished giving him a drink, she said, I will also draw water for your camels until they

00:33:42.839 --> 00:33:52.519
are done drinking. So she quickly emptied her jar into the drinking trough and ran again and

00:33:52.920 --> 00:34:00.599
again to the well to draw water. And she kept drawing water for all his camels. Easy to read.

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:09.239
Not so easy to do. Now researchers tell us that a camel can drink 25 gallons of water.

00:34:10.599 --> 00:34:18.199
Now let's be careful with our figures here. Does that mean that Rebecca drew 25 times 10 or

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:27.320
250 gallons for those camels? Not necessarily. A camel has good mileage. You can get 40 or 50 miles

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:34.840
of the gallon from a camel. And so it's possible that the camels made that 500 mile journey on

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:42.519
five or six gallons of water. But even if that was so, 50 or 60 gallons is still a lot of water.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.119
Now Al-Eezer had men with him. And as she could have said, well, I'll draw water for you,

00:34:48.119 --> 00:34:54.039
and your men can help themselves to the water after all their servants, I'm not. But she didn't.

00:34:54.840 --> 00:35:02.360
So what do we learn about her? She was a hard worker. Now you and I would have been ready for a nap

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:08.840
after drawing all that water. But now she's a hospitable woman. She offers straw for the camels

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:15.880
and a place for the men to spend the night. So what do we learn about her? We learn that she is

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:24.199
a hard worker and she is warm and hospitable. What do we learn about Isaac? He's a warm man of

00:35:24.199 --> 00:35:31.320
sentiment. What about the camels? Well, when we used to look for types and anti-types,

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:38.599
we thought that the 10 camels pictured the perfect word of God and just as the camels brought

00:35:38.599 --> 00:35:45.719
Rebecca to Isaac, so the word of God brings the bride to Christ. A couple of problems with that.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:51.880
First of all, the camel is an unclean animal. And you wouldn't think that Jehovah would select

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:58.599
an unclean animal to picture his perfect word. And then if the camels picture the perfect word of

00:35:58.599 --> 00:36:03.880
God, you'd think that it would be the camels that would bring water to Rebecca and not the other

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:12.539
way around. So it seems that the camels are just camels. Well, the day after Ali's are

00:36:12.539 --> 00:36:18.780
arrives, he asks Rebecca if she's willing to return to Bershiba. Now, as we mentioned, that's a

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:28.699
500 mile journey on a camel. How long would it take? These are not your speedy roadster camels.

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:33.900
There are speedy camels that can do about 100 miles a day, but these would be the slow,

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:43.820
burden-bearing Arabian camels, and they can do about 25 miles a day. So you're looking at a 20-day

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:50.059
journey on a camel. How would you like to meet your fiancée for the first time

00:36:50.059 --> 00:36:58.219
after you traveled 20 days on a camel? Well, Rebecca was no pushover. She was a strong woman.

00:36:59.099 --> 00:37:05.980
When Esau and Jacob were born, Jehovah had said that the older Esau was going to serve

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:12.699
the younger Jacob. But remember what happened when Isaac thought he was about to die? He wanted to

00:37:12.699 --> 00:37:20.219
bless the older Esau. And Rebecca took action so that Jacob got the blessing. Now whether she was

00:37:20.219 --> 00:37:26.940
fully aware of it or not, that fit into Jehovah's purpose. So we're thinking of warm

00:37:27.579 --> 00:37:35.739
sentimental Isaac and a strong, hard-working, smart, hospitable woman. What a wonderful

00:37:35.739 --> 00:37:42.860
combination that made. And it makes us think of how many Rebecca's we have in the organization today.

00:37:43.659 --> 00:37:49.659
Some of them were working in construction. Others are working in Bethel. Others in the field.

00:37:50.539 --> 00:37:56.059
They're willing to learn new languages and to serve with a need is great. They're hard workers.

00:37:56.059 --> 00:38:02.699
They're willing to do whatever is required and even go beyond the call of duty. They're hospitable,

00:38:02.699 --> 00:38:11.500
smart, attractive. Our sisters make an amazing contribution to Bethel. What would we do without them?

00:38:13.099 --> 00:38:18.380
By keeping our ear attentive to wisdom and account like that of Isaac and Rebecca,

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:23.340
it becomes so much more than a biblical history lesson. As you listen to Brother

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:29.659
explain, did you picture real people like us? Did you see their godly qualities that we can

00:38:29.659 --> 00:38:36.619
imitate like Rebecca's hospitality? Isaac and Rebecca face trials similar to ones you may be

00:38:36.619 --> 00:38:43.579
facing now. The death of a loved one or challenging assignment far from home. Meditating on their

00:38:43.579 --> 00:38:48.619
reliance on Jehovah can give us the confidence we need to keep trusting in God.

00:38:49.099 --> 00:38:57.179
Our study of spiritual truths is also life-saving. It sets us free from false religion and protects

00:38:57.179 --> 00:39:04.539
us from bad influences. Our team met Brother Boniface Kwamla in the Volta region of Ghana. From

00:39:04.539 --> 00:39:10.460
infancy, he was surrounded by superstitious beliefs and practices. What did he find that

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:19.710
transformed his life and caused him to take a courageous stand? At a tender age, I have a troubled

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:28.650
mind as to how I would be pleasing to God and also at the same time be pleasing in the rest of the

00:39:28.650 --> 00:39:40.349
voodoo. Two of my siblings died before I was born. So my mother or seeking protection

00:39:40.909 --> 00:39:52.480
or through her pregnancy with me, my mother was made to believe that when she goes to the

00:39:52.480 --> 00:40:00.960
voodoo shrine regularly, she will be protected from the witches. This means she has to walk

00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:11.679
about four miles to the shrine regularly bare-footed. After my bed, I was sent to the voodoo shrine to

00:40:11.679 --> 00:40:21.039
be protected from the attack of the witches. I was kept there. I got baptized into the Catholic

00:40:21.039 --> 00:40:29.280
church. There we were taught that those who worship idols, the voodoos, will be bent

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:38.760
in an everlasting hellfire. I was terrified. I knew that God's name is Jehovah.

00:40:40.199 --> 00:40:47.480
I had a name Jehovah's Witnesses and it appealed to me so it kept on ringing in my ears,

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:59.980
Jehovah's Witnesses, Jehovah's Witnesses. When the relatives were discussing religion and the

00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:12.570
scholars, but I said, if I join any church at all, it will be Jehovah's Witnesses. One day,

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:22.250
I asked my father, would the priest be angry if he knows that we, after going for the communion,

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:31.530
still going to the shrine. My father came back with the news that the priest said,

00:41:32.409 --> 00:41:39.289
I can still go ahead being an idol worshiper and at the same time being a Catholic.

00:41:40.489 --> 00:41:54.349
I became disturbed. I became confused. I came across Jehovah's Witnesses when I was of age and left

00:41:54.349 --> 00:42:05.530
the village. I bombarded them with questions. I became very furious. When they told me,

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:13.449
Easter, Christmas, New Year celebration, even the cross we used were of pagan origin. So I demanded

00:42:13.449 --> 00:42:23.960
a book. I read that book before they break. So that night, in my heart, I broke away from the voodoo

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:37.800
and also from the Catholic religion. I was afraid to confront my father over the issue. In our culture,

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:48.559
it's not easy for a young man to take such a crucial decision. Before I could be aware,

00:42:49.119 --> 00:42:56.079
there was the news in the village that now don't go has joined the new religion. So anytime I go

00:42:56.079 --> 00:43:03.360
home, relatives will knock on my door. I don't do advise me to retain my decision.

00:43:05.559 --> 00:43:24.679
My worry was how to inform my father. And one day, my father invited me and then inquire of me

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:40.000
of what was really happening. And it became a very strong confrontation. I told him, I was

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:48.320
worshiped Jehovah. Jehovah is the only God I worshiped. So he fled up, left me and then went into

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:55.199
this room. So I also entered my room and started singing. Once with confusion, our side has

00:43:55.199 --> 00:44:05.760
waived, drinking the Catholic religion distilled. I was singing so vigorously. I see somebody who has

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:17.929
been liberated because initially I was in prison. But now I am a freed man. So since then,

00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:35.099
I've been saving Jehovah. The fear of man has been overcome. I am no longer a captive of the fear

00:44:35.099 --> 00:44:45.019
of death or even the dead. I no longer engage myself in any practices that are contrary to Bible

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:58.559
standards. I feel liberated. It makes me happy when I see my children also serving the only true God

00:44:58.559 --> 00:45:28.730
Jehovah. And now I live a very happy, family life. Brother Kwomla had a desire to know God,

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:35.130
but as we saw, something was missing without help. How could he incline his heart to discernment?

00:45:35.929 --> 00:45:41.369
Only when he received the truth book, as a young man, did he have spiritual food to study God's

00:45:41.369 --> 00:45:48.010
work? At last, he was able to understand God's sayings instead of false religions. He was

00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:55.449
baptized in 1976. As a pioneer and elder, brother Kwomla directs people to the spiritual

00:45:55.449 --> 00:46:01.369
instruction we receive in the congregation. He is like many of our dear brothers who are

00:46:01.369 --> 00:46:08.889
desires of a fine work and reach out as ministerial servants and shepherds. But why do some who have

00:46:08.889 --> 00:46:15.769
the circumstances to serve hold back? Could it be that other matters take a higher priority?

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:23.369
Or do you feel unsure how you can qualify? No matter what the reason, you can make changes.

00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:29.849
Notice how this brother learns what it really means to reach out and the spiritual benefits

00:46:29.849 --> 00:46:39.690
it brings. They say that a healthy mind lives in a healthy body

00:46:42.409 --> 00:46:47.690
and I take good care of mine, not a day without exercising.

00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:53.929
And I do my best to stick to a spiritual routine too.

00:46:54.809 --> 00:47:03.449
Oh no, the meeting for field service. I've got to get going. By the way, my name is Ryan.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:13.360
I'm glad I could work with Andrew this morning. He's always so well prepared for the ministry.

00:47:14.559 --> 00:47:18.960
You see, I'm not so good at starting conversations with people I don't know.

00:47:20.079 --> 00:47:24.639
And then it's great to have Andrew on your team. He's really good at that.

00:47:26.559 --> 00:47:32.480
And once we're done here, I'm off into the woods for a long hike. It's like the only

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:39.840
place I can recharge my batteries. Andrew suggests that we first do some of my return visits.

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:56.090
Well, I'm afraid I don't have any. Sorry Andrew, maybe next weekend. I like our meetings,

00:47:56.889 --> 00:48:05.289
but I wish I'd prepared better. Now the study is over. And again, I couldn't comment.

00:48:07.659 --> 00:48:15.980
Man, I need to be at the cinema in 10 minutes. Oh yeah, thanks, Edgar. My field service report.

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:24.280
My group over there always has to remind me how come I always forget?

00:48:31.239 --> 00:48:37.960
Andrew and I are good friends. To be honest, he seems to be the only friend I've got in our

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:46.730
congregation. Last week, he was appointed as a ministerial servant. I'm not surprised at all.

00:48:47.769 --> 00:48:56.250
He is a great example, especially for me. I wonder why I haven't qualified to be a ministerial servant.

00:49:03.579 --> 00:49:10.460
Wow, Andrew's always busy for the congregation, helping the friends, taking care of our older

00:49:10.539 --> 00:49:21.840
brothers and sisters. He really cares for them. How come I never think of that? That evening,

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:28.159
Edgar and Martin, the assistant group overseer, came over. They've noticed how hard I train to

00:49:28.159 --> 00:49:33.679
stay in good shape physically, but am I working as hard to be in good shape spiritually?

00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:43.920
Martin reminded me of 1 Timothy 3-1. This statement is trustworthy. If a man is reaching out to be

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:54.489
an overseer, he is desirous of a fine work. This principle applies to me since an overseer qualifies

00:49:54.489 --> 00:50:01.929
first as a ministerial servant. The brothers ask me, how is the apostle Paul an example to someone

00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:09.639
whose desirous of a fine work? Paul strengthens the friends by giving encouraging talks.

00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:20.719
He showed personal interest for the elderly, for the fatherless boys, and had a good share in

00:50:20.719 --> 00:50:31.840
the ministry. The brothers were right. Having a good share in the ministry gives so much happiness.

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:36.559
Edgar commended me for how I handled that last return visit.

00:50:37.519 --> 00:50:46.170
Who knows, maybe I will conduct Bible studies soon. I didn't realise that we had so many

00:50:46.170 --> 00:50:51.210
nice friends in our congregation. Perhaps I just didn't give them a chance in the past.

00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:58.170
I guess I had a spiritual routine before, but I was too distracted by what I wanted to do,

00:50:58.809 --> 00:51:06.090
but there is so much I can do for others. With better preparation, I feel more comfortable giving

00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:12.329
comments, and I was able to stand in for a part during the midweek meeting. Martin gave me some

00:51:12.329 --> 00:51:20.489
greater vice afterwards. The apostle Paul worked hard, gave to others, and reached out.

00:51:22.090 --> 00:51:33.900
Following his example gives me so much joy in life. Now I realise what it really means to reach out.

00:51:34.539 --> 00:51:38.699
It's all about being a spiritual man.

00:51:45.739 --> 00:51:52.699
What did Ryan learn about reaching out? He saw that it involves building up his own spirituality,

00:51:52.699 --> 00:51:57.900
and then looking for opportunities to give of himself to serve those in the congregation.

00:51:59.179 --> 00:52:05.579
If you see the potential in your life to reach out, pray to Jehovah, seek advice from the elders,

00:52:05.579 --> 00:52:11.340
and start making changes. Make it the subject of your next personal study project,

00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:17.739
as you treasure up God's commandments. When you reach out, you'll find the happiness that Jesus

00:52:17.739 --> 00:52:24.539
says comes from giving. When we look around our congregation, we're sure to find brothers and

00:52:24.539 --> 00:52:31.099
sisters young and old who can use our help in a spiritual or a practical way. Sometimes when we

00:52:31.099 --> 00:52:37.820
look, we're amazed at what some with seemingly impossible limitations are already doing for themselves

00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:43.980
with the help of God's Spirit. Imagine wanting to study the Bible and preach the good news

00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:50.300
in spite of a severe handicap. We met a sister who, from birth, faced that very challenge.

00:52:56.559 --> 00:53:02.000
I'm Sabine Hernandez, and I'm from Panama. I have the honor of participating in theocratic

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:06.400
activities. I just have to do it a little differently, but I enjoy it just the same.

00:53:10.199 --> 00:53:17.880
Well, I was born handicapped. It was a C-section birth with a lot of complications.

00:53:19.559 --> 00:53:26.119
So I can't use my hands and feet as fully as most people can. I can't walk.

00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:31.320
We went to the doctors every week, and I would miss work just to take her.

00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:36.599
They helped her with her therapy, and I had to do a lot of things for her at home.

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:43.880
The doctors wanted to keep me for some medical experiments, but my mom flat out refused to accept

00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:51.710
that idea. But thankfully, my mind is normal. Although some of my friends tell me I have a few

00:53:51.710 --> 00:54:00.429
screws loose, but I don't think so. As far as growing up in the neighborhood in Turillo,

00:54:00.429 --> 00:54:05.469
everything was normal. I used to fight with my brothers all the time, and I played with all the

00:54:05.469 --> 00:54:11.789
kids in the neighborhood. Then one day, the brothers came preaching door to door.

00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:20.320
So we started the study, and things progressed. I used to ask myself,

00:54:21.119 --> 00:54:25.519
how am I going to teach her to handle the Bible if she can't use her hands?

00:54:26.719 --> 00:54:32.320
About what I didn't know was how well she could use her tongue. I would say to scripture,

00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:38.079
and she would look it up with her tongue. Many times she would find it before I did.

00:54:40.159 --> 00:54:46.000
It all happened gradually, but I knew that what I was learning was very valuable. I can't say it was

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:51.440
because of one particular scripture or anything like that. It was really just getting to know the

00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:57.519
very personality of Jehovah and the way the brothers and sisters treated me. In order to go to the

00:54:57.519 --> 00:55:03.199
kingdom hall or to the assemblies, the brothers have to carry me. And of course, as I kept growing,

00:55:03.199 --> 00:55:09.840
I got heavier and heavier. So that was an easy, you know. When I got baptized, I had affection for

00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:15.920
Jehovah, but as I kept growing spiritually and getting to know him better, I began to really

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:24.409
treasure the privilege of serving him. The idea of talking to others made me feel terrified,

00:55:24.409 --> 00:55:31.289
scared to death, and all panicky. But all the encouragement I got from the brothers,

00:55:31.289 --> 00:55:36.650
friends, traveling overseers, and all the assistants my mom has given me were a big help.

00:55:37.369 --> 00:55:44.250
Now I really love preaching door to door. I have a little list of phone numbers that I've

00:55:44.250 --> 00:55:50.090
put together from homes in our congregation's territory. The eagle that know me have come up to me

00:55:50.090 --> 00:55:54.969
and said, I got a phone call from your daughter the other day. And I was like, what? My daughter?

00:55:57.210 --> 00:56:03.530
The sisters are so kind and they support me by bringing some of their Bible studies to my house

00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:09.289
so that I can share with them in the study. What I can't do with my hands, I can do almost

00:56:09.289 --> 00:56:22.539
almost anything with my tongue. I type on the computer with a pencil or pen. And then when it's ready,

00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:32.329
I print it, fold it, and put it into an envelope. Then I take it to sisters at the kingdom hall.

00:56:32.329 --> 00:56:37.210
They're my secretaries and they leave it at night at homes where the householders are out working.

00:56:40.460 --> 00:56:44.780
It really makes you happy because you know it makes others happy.

00:56:46.539 --> 00:56:52.139
I left a letter that Sabina had written with an unmarried couple. They made arrangements right

00:56:52.139 --> 00:57:00.619
away to please Jehovah and were legally married. Jehovah has been so kind to me. You know,

00:57:02.139 --> 00:57:06.860
when your handicapped and someone helps you or you're an older person and you get the necessary

00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:15.260
help, that really changes your life in an incredible way. I would not put it some people think they

00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:20.300
have to go and encourage her. But when they get there, the opposite happens. She's the one that

00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:31.760
encourages them. Do not be afraid for I am with you. Do not gaze about for I am your God.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:44.320
I will fortify you. I will really help you. I will really keep fast hold of you with my right

00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:55.289
hand of righteousness. Sister Sabina Hernandez has been approved this month as an auxiliary pioneer.

00:58:01.019 --> 00:58:23.389
Because if Sabina can do it, all the rest of us can too. Sabina appreciates the loving

00:58:23.389 --> 00:58:29.230
assistance from her family and congregation. But as we saw, she's not content to let her

00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:35.869
limitations stop her from doing what she can. She's able to search for spiritual treasures and take

00:58:35.869 --> 00:58:42.030
what she learns to people in her ministry. After 30 years in the truth, her determined example

00:58:42.030 --> 00:58:48.909
motivated her own brother to study the Bible and get baptized. After receiving her motorized

00:58:48.909 --> 00:58:55.230
cart, one of Sabina's new joys was to approach brothers and sisters and greet them as assemblies

00:58:55.230 --> 00:59:00.510
and conventions. You and I can look forward to that same joy the next time we're able to attend

00:59:00.510 --> 00:59:07.869
a convention. But until then, we can take a look back through our music video Joy of Conventions.

00:59:07.949 --> 00:59:15.550
It's packed with beautiful scenes from our 2014 Keep Seeking First God's Kingdom International

00:59:15.550 --> 01:03:14.079
Conventions. What a beautiful video and song that shows the two-fold joy we experience at our

01:03:14.079 --> 01:03:20.000
conventions. We feel the unity and love of our worldwide brotherhood. And we're happy to be

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:27.280
feeding undistracted for several days at Jehovah's Spiritual Table. Thinking back to the 2014

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:32.400
conventions, many of you have been asking for access to the video clips that were shown during

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:38.239
that program. I am pleased to announce that they are now available on the video on the man's

01:03:38.239 --> 01:03:44.880
section of JW Broadcasting. You will find these listed under the programs and events category.

01:03:47.239 --> 01:03:52.519
We hope you've enjoyed this month's program and its focus on how to treasure the spiritual food

01:03:52.519 --> 01:03:59.079
that Jehovah provides so abundantly. We conclude our program by taking a visit to Madagascar.

01:03:59.639 --> 01:04:05.800
This large beautiful island off the east coast of Africa is home to thousands of plant and

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:11.639
animal species found nowhere else on earth. It's sometimes called the big red island because of

01:04:11.639 --> 01:04:18.599
its red soil. But our brothers and sisters there are cultivating Madagascar's spiritual soil

01:04:18.599 --> 01:04:25.480
and finding the fields ripe for harvesting. The nearly 30,000 publishers preach zealously and

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:34.360
enjoy a 7% increase in 2014. But this is not without challenges. In remote areas, many of our brothers

01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:41.159
walk long distances to the meetings and in the ministry. This dear sister paddles across a river

01:04:41.159 --> 01:04:47.800
to attend her meetings. Because of the steady growth in Madagascar, there's a need for more kingdom

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:54.599
halls. So our brothers cherish the dignified halls that they do have to gather and worship together.

01:04:55.639 --> 01:05:02.280
