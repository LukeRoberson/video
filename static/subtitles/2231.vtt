00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.580
Infectious diseases have been around for a long time.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.580
In the past, you may have just heard about outbreaks in other places.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.579
But what can you do when a disease spreads close to home?

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.579
So much is out of your control.

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:25.579
It can be scary.

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:30.579
But there's a lot you can do to protect yourself and stay healthy.

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.579
Some of the most effective steps are also the simplest.

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.579
Like washing your hands often.

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.579
If you wash for at least 20 seconds,

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.579
soap and water can break up the virus or bacteria and rinse it away.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.579
A strong alcohol-based hand sanitizer can work too.

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.579
Coffin sneeze into a tissue or the inside of your elbow.

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:03.579
And avoid touching your face, especially after you touch something else.

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.579
Follow instructions from the authorities that might mean staying home for a while,

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:17.579
wearing a mask when you go out or keeping the recommended safe distance from other people.

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:21.579
And if you do get sick, call a doctor right away.

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:25.579
Your emotional health is important too.

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:29.579
Too much bad news, unverified rumors,

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.579
even conflicting reports can cause anxiety.

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:39.579
Stay informed but set limits so you don't feel overwhelmed.

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:44.579
Keep yourself occupied and stay connected with friends and family.

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.579
You might cheer them up and feel a little better yourself.

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.579
There's another aspect of your health that's important.

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:00.579
In the Bible, Jesus sought time alone to pray and meditate.

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.579
Use some of your time to take care of your spiritual health.

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.579
If you focus on a hope for a better future,

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.580
it'll be easier to cope with challenges today.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.580
Jehovah's Witnesses keep their hope strong by sharing it with others in whatever ways are safe.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.580
They show people what the Bible teaches.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.580
They invite them to their meetings too.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.580
If possible, they meet in person.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.580
If not, they have video meetings.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.580
The Bible says at Isaiah 33-24,

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.580
that someday no one will say, I am sick.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.580
Until then, it says at Isaiah 30-15,

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.580
that your strength will be in keeping calm and showing trust.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.580
So when things like this happen, do your best to stay calm,

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.580
stay informed, and stay healthy.
