00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.009
Our family had been learning Chinese for over a year.

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:10.009
It wasn't easy.

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:13.009
God has many titles.

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.010
Did you know he has only one name?

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.009
I was ready, or at least I thought so.

00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:43.719
Yeah, I'll be right there.

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:45.719
We were making progress.

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.380
And we weren't giving up.

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:17.219
It seemed like most people just weren't interested.

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:28.450
We were not having a good morning.

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.569
Mom and Liz weren't having a good morning either.

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:39.569
Brother and sister Lynn joined us.

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:42.569
They've been a big help to us.

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:45.569
We told them about our morning.

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:49.569
We were finally able to converse a little and give presentations,

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:51.569
but everything seemed to fall flat.

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:55.909
You asked good questions at the door,

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.909
but not always the right one.

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.909
See, when you learn the language,

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.909
do not forget to learn about people.

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.770
He was right.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.770
Our questions started conversations in our old territory,

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.770
but not here.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.770
The pronunciation is very good.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:18.770
Thanks, Berlin.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.770
We needed a different approach,

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.770
where we didn't just learn the language,

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.770
but also how to reach the heart of someone who speaks it.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.020
In the July 2019 watch tower,

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.020
we read about reaching the hearts of non-religious people.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.020
It was in paragraph seven.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.020
How do you think that we could be more like the Apostle Paul?

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.020
Well, Paul was a Jew,

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.020
but when he was talking to other people,

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.020
he had to adapt his presentation.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.020
I like what First Corinthians 9, 20 through 23 says.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.020
To the Jews, I became as a Jew in order to gain Jews.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.020
To those under law, I became a Jew.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.020
Liz was right.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.020
When Paul spoke to fellow Jews and Athens,

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.020
he reasoned from the Scriptures.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.020
But when he spoke to the Greeks at the Aereopagus,

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.020
he adapted,

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.020
reasoning with them first without the Bible.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.020
He later wrote,

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.020
I have become all things to people of all sorts,

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.020
so that I might by all possible means save some.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.020
That's what we needed to do.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.020
We learned more about the people.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.419
We started to listen more

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:44.569
and talk about things that interested them.

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.569
We found different ways to start conversations.

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:58.319
And we kept learning more about the culture.

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.319
Part of a Chinese proverb, by found, says,

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.319
He who comes near ink is stained black.

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.319
It's been a great way to introduce Proverbs 13-20.

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.319
The one walking with the wise will become wise.

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:29.819
It all comes down to showing love.

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:47.639
The more we pay attention to how we were teaching,

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.639
the more we were able to show people the God who loves them.
