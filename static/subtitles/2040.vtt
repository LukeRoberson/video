00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:12.900
We are in the printer at the Canada branch, and what's behind me is our high-speed printing press.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.899
Since the printing press does not produce a finished product,

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:24.899
we need the finishing line in order to trim, stack, count, and pack Bible literature.

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:29.899
We need a new in-line finishing system because of the speed of the press,

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:35.899
the quantity that we produce, but also the variety of publications printed here in Canada.

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.899
Our brothers in the Britain branch are designing and manufacturing the new finishing line

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.899
because they have themselves a high-speed press and experience in designing and manufacturing equipment like that.

00:00:47.899 --> 00:01:07.859
We could go out and buy a finishing line like this.

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:12.859
But one of the advantages of this system is that we can actually construct it ourselves exactly to our needs

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:16.859
and because of the way it's built, we can actually install it in quite a short period of time.

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:23.859
We have to install the whole machine inside a week, so it splits into 26 sections, each of which is mounted on wheels.

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:28.859
It's on 400 wheels, so it can actually be wheeled into place, which makes the end insulation much easier.

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:33.909
So we have 69 different motors.

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:40.909
There are over 30,000 pieces. There's over 3,000 drawings. It weighs about 8 tons and is over 40 metres long.

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.700
It's a wonder on 400 wheels.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.700
Just now at this stage, we've been fitting in the region of a thousand parts a day.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.700
We'll then divide it into its sections, put it into four shipping containers and it will be shipped to our Canada branch.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:35.189
We had people from all over the world coming together to work on this project.

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:40.189
And the result is what you see behind me right now. We have a completed finishing line

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:45.189
and the quality that we're getting as a result of this line is better than anything we've had before.

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:49.189
It's been so wonderful to see how the organization and all this different branches work together

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:53.189
with the same common goal to produce Bible literature.

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:57.189
We're very happy to do it because of all the millions of people who will benefit.
