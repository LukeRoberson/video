WEBVTT

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:08.460
Continuing our excellent program, we will now get to enjoy our final talk.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.460
And the brother Anthony Morris of the governing body will be giving this talk to us,

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.460
and he has an interesting theme also.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.460
A blueprint for spiritual success.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.460
Brother Morris, please give us this valuable blueprint.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:39.439
To introduce the information, I thought I'd show you this here, and this is a blueprint.

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:46.060
Now this one happens to be, I got it from a friend of mine.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.060
This was part of the blueprint for building world headquarters.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:58.060
So this is connected with the offices, services, building, and that's the blueprint.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:07.060
Now what I did learn is that you also have, and I got it, in that business,

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.060
a lot of them are white background now.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.060
In Webster's dictionary, it did capture that fact very nicely.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.060
Here's what it says, defining a blueprint, that word,

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:31.060
a photographic print in white on a bright blue ground, or blue on a white ground.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:39.060
It used, especially for copying maps, mechanical drawings, and architect plans.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.060
Particularly thinking of the architect plans.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:53.060
And I couldn't help but think about Proverbs chapter 8, and we see there Jesus being referred to as the master worker.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.060
And Jehovah really, the architect, he's the creator.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:06.060
Now Jesus was a spiritual success with that, because he followed the architect's direction.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:15.060
So that's something I want you to keep in mind, and we'll get to the blueprint, as I'm calling it in a moment.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.060
The other definition in Webster's dictionary, I thought, was pertinent.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:29.060
Something resembling a blueprint, as in serving as a model, or providing guidance.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:40.060
And I love that one little expression that appeared after that, especially a detailed plan or program of action.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:49.060
So that's how I'm borrowing that word, a blueprint, with these following thoughts and Peter's second letter.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:57.060
So if you could, we're going to show you what I'm referring anyway to as a blueprint for spiritual success.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:09.060
So second Peter, chapter one, and there's nine things you'll notice here that we're going to emphasize in verses five through seven.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:26.060
So Peter writes, for this very reason, put forth all earnest effort to supply to your faith, virtue, to your virtue knowledge, to your knowledge self control,

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:41.060
to your self control endurance, to your endurance, godly devotion, to either godly devotion, brotherly affection, to your brotherly affection, love.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.060
So there's the blueprint.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.060
So there's nine thoughts that are expressed here.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:04:01.060
Obviously, there's a lot of other things that you'll have gave us the whole Bible, but this is just for a nice memory aid, a good blueprint for you to continue as spiritual successful people.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.060
Now, the first one there is earnest effort.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:26.060
Now, obviously, and we commend you for it, you've shown earnest effort just to come this far to be invited to Gilead and to qualify for that and during your class and going out in the ministry and the weekends earnest effort.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.060
So you have to continue that.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:42.060
That's not born with earnest effort. That's a decision you make. I have to make the same decision. We're going to put forth earnest effort starts there. No effort, no success.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:51.060
So each individual has to decide, I'm putting forth the earnest effort here and I'm going to be a success.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:59.060
You get the earnest effort and then this is what's involved here. I have the effort to have faith.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:08.060
Now, time doesn't allow to go to detail on each one of these, but faith obviously is essential.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:25.060
Now, notice in the Hebrew chapter 12 or excuse me 11, Hebrews 11 and absolute necessity of faith to be a spiritual success here in chapter 11 verse 1.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:33.060
Faith is the assured expectation of what is hope for the evident demonstration of realities that are not seen.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:42.060
So it goes down to emphasize the need for it. Now, essential it is in verse 6, same chapter.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:57.060
Moreover, without faith, it is impossible to please God. Well, for whoever approaches God must believe that he is and that he becomes the rewater of those earnestly seeking him.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.060
That's pretty clear.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:11.060
Not easy to misunderstand what's being said here. You have to keep your assured expectation of what you've been hoping for.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:22.060
That's part of being a spiritual success. It can't weaken. And how clear does it get? You can't please God and I can't please God without faith.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:32.060
That's serious business. And none of us want to go the remainder of the time, not pleasing our Heavenly Father, Jehovah God and appreciate that.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:45.060
In fact, right before he went into that in the previous, what we call chapter 10, notice verse 38 and verse 39 of chapter 10.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:53.060
But my righteous one will live by reason of faith and if he shrinks back, I have no pleasure in him.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:07:04.060
Now, we are not the sort who shrink back to destruction, but the sort who have faith for the preserving of our lives or they were applying it now.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:11.060
You're going to be a spiritual success in him, everlasting life, but to have to have faith.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.060
Crucial.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:23.060
Now, next, he mentions virtue. Now, that has to do with moral excellence.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:32.060
So all of you have that somewhere single. Others, if you're married, you have virtue that moral excellence.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:41.060
And when you're morally excellent, especially in these last days in this world, Bordia stand out.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:51.060
And what does that do? It's not that you're trying to stand out. Your moral excellence, your virtuous behavior, glorifies God.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:59.060
And Jehovah appreciates that. He wants us to succeed at glorifying him. Bring attention to it.

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:07.310
We don't joke about immorality.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:12.310
You know what I mean? The comedians are full of it. We're morally excellent.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:18.310
We don't have a thing to do with the spirit of the world with that.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:30.310
Now, next, he mentions here, knowledge, knowledge. Well, obviously, you appreciate knowledge.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:42.309
You had a lot of knowledge before you got to Gile, but how many people in this organization have a few months of studying like you have?

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:50.309
It is incredible, isn't it? I mean, very hard for you to explain to others. Then you are reading the Bible before you got here.

00:08:50.309 --> 00:08:57.309
Don't raise your hand if you didn't quite get there. God forgives you.

00:08:57.309 --> 00:09:07.309
Pins on circumstances. But once you were here, and we love our instructors here with the theocratic schools of teaching committee.

00:09:07.309 --> 00:09:17.309
You have a whole lot more knowledge than you did a few months ago. Don't you agree? It's just wonderful.

00:09:17.309 --> 00:09:26.309
Now, part of you succeeding is don't be satisfied with this downpour of all his knowledge.

00:09:26.309 --> 00:09:34.309
Just take it as valuable to keep going. You've got some new ideas on how to research some things and go with it.

00:09:34.309 --> 00:09:39.309
But if you're going to be a spiritual success, you've got to keep taking in the knowledge.

00:09:39.309 --> 00:09:48.309
It's very clear, very simple, and Jehovah will bless your intake of knowledge.

00:09:48.309 --> 00:09:56.309
There's no end to it. It's wonderful. It's always amazed.

00:09:56.309 --> 00:10:02.309
As I said, the more I learn, the more I realize how little I know.

00:10:03.309 --> 00:10:07.309
No, that's not just a statement. That's a fact.

00:10:07.309 --> 00:10:16.309
Imagine what Jehovah says, but isn't that great? It'll go on pre-turningly, taking in knowledge.

00:10:16.309 --> 00:10:24.309
If you do it now, you'll be able to do it forever. What a honor of our Heavenly Father.

00:10:24.309 --> 00:10:31.309
Again, he mentions here to your knowledge self-control.

00:10:31.309 --> 00:10:37.309
Now, that's an aspect of the footage of the Spirit that you're well aware of.

00:10:37.309 --> 00:10:46.309
You have to have, if you're going to succeed spiritually and gain everlasting life, you need self-control.

00:10:46.309 --> 00:10:51.309
And you have to pray about it, especially in these last days.

00:10:51.309 --> 00:10:58.309
Notice 1 Corinthians chapter 10, and we'll come back here to Peter right after him.

00:10:58.309 --> 00:11:14.909
So here in verse 12, 1 Corinthians 10, 12, so let the one who thinks he is standing beware that he does not fall.

00:11:15.909 --> 00:11:20.909
So our thinking, we need to pray for self-control with it.

00:11:20.909 --> 00:11:28.909
Because the devil and his wicked system, as well as he and his demons, are always trying to affect our thinking.

00:11:28.909 --> 00:11:35.909
So in this case here, you think you're standing? Guess what? You're about ready to fall.

00:11:36.909 --> 00:11:40.909
It's all by saying to your Holy Police, give me self-control.

00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:46.909
Or you see when the devil might try some sort of temptation or whatever thing you face.

00:11:46.909 --> 00:11:53.909
Give me self-control. I want to stand firm for you. Now you're okay.

00:11:53.909 --> 00:12:04.909
The Holy Spirit will do that. You'll have that self-control necessary to oppose the devil in his wicked effort.

00:12:05.909 --> 00:12:10.909
Make it so that we don't succeed. So it's just crucial.

00:12:10.909 --> 00:12:19.909
Now next, he mentions, with self-control, the blueprint goes on endurance.

00:12:19.909 --> 00:12:26.909
Why? We could spend considerable time just talking about endurance.

00:12:26.909 --> 00:12:42.909
It's absolutely essential. Some of the things you've endured already in your dedicated life and as I told the brothers and the coordinators committee office, you know, when we're facing these disasters and all these things.

00:12:42.909 --> 00:12:49.909
And I've been telling them, for some time now cheer up, it's going to get worse.

00:12:49.909 --> 00:12:54.909
And so we keep a sense of humor with it, but that's a fact.

00:12:54.909 --> 00:12:59.909
What we're experiencing right now in this global pandemic.

00:12:59.909 --> 00:13:04.909
I was telling the branch class yesterday, it doesn't bother me.

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:08.909
We've been waiting for this. We knew things like this were going to happen.

00:13:08.909 --> 00:13:13.909
Christ Jesus is preparedness. Where's the shock?

00:13:13.909 --> 00:13:21.909
Now you got to think in Jehovah directs us with how to deal with these things, but we endure.

00:13:21.909 --> 00:13:27.909
And that's why Jesus, you remember this in Matthew 24, and we'll come back here.

00:13:27.909 --> 00:13:30.909
Matthew chapter 24.

00:13:30.909 --> 00:13:37.350
And we've been so well equipped. It's all here.

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:43.350
So we can be a success. Verse 13, Matthew 24.

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:52.350
But the one who has endured to the end, who showed some endurance, no?

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:57.350
The one who has endured to the end will be saved.

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:02.350
So that's what we beg Jehovah help us. It's part of the blueprint.

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:07.350
We're going to endure to the end.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:14.350
Whatever we have to face with Jehovah's support, we're going to succeed.

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:21.350
Now, after endurance, he mentions godly devotion.

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:26.350
And I'll watch towers come in and this year's past.

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:30.350
And it's a beautiful thing to keep in mind.

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:41.350
And why this is so crucial to a spiritual success is, and it's captured nicely here in the revised translation, godly devotion.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:54.350
So the thinking there and to try to convey what was coming across here for all of us is, you're devoted or undevoted to Jehovah personally.

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:59.350
This attachment to him personally.

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:04.350
So some of you are married couples. Well, you're made.

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:11.350
You want your mate to be attached to your god that you worship together.

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:18.350
That's what is going to make a success. Godly devotion, personally attached to Jehovah.

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:22.350
It affects every aspect of our life.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:25.350
We're attached to him. It's personal.

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:34.350
It's just something special and everyone should have that feeling, not just devotion.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:38.350
No attachment to him. We love him. We're whole soul.

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:44.350
You get exclusive devotion. Right now I'm just thinking about thinking of him and how you can't see him.

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:52.350
But I got goosebumps on my back, thinking about the love for him, the attachment to him.

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:59.350
And how nice when if you are married, your mate has that boy, you're going to succeed.

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:07.350
Devotion to him personally for all that he has shown and will show.

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:11.350
It's just very personal.

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:21.350
Next, he attaches after godly devotion, brotherly affection.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:24.350
Brotherly affection.

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:31.350
So when you think about that now, and I appreciate it for the new mayor's comments.

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:34.350
And I saw this yesterday with you for a couple of lectures.

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:44.350
Then yesterday saw some of you after your last class and the new mayor mentioned how you enjoy Jehovah's company.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:49.350
Well, what he was describing was your brotherly affection for each other.

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:53.350
It's real. It's genuine. You have that brotherly affection.

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:57.350
That should be true in all the congregations.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:02.350
You've displayed it. Well, to succeed, you've got to continue to do that.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:05.349
Well, here's something for you to think about.

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:08.349
Because commendably, you've done well with that.

00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:11.349
Sure, you're going to take it back with you.

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:14.349
This need for godly devotion.

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:16.349
You're going to do that.

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:21.349
Counting on it. However, here's a thought for you from first, first,

00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:28.710
first, that salon is chapter four.

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:33.710
First, that salon is chapter four to something to consider.

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:39.710
You're soon to be graduates and take it with you to your assignments.

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:43.710
First, that salon is chapter four, verse nine.

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:47.710
And then here, the 10th verse is well.

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:54.710
However, concerning brotherly love, you do not need us to write to you.

00:17:54.710 --> 00:18:00.710
For you yourselves are taught by God to love one another.

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:06.710
In fact, you are doing so toward all the brothers and all of Macedonia.

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:10.710
Now notice this. This is a thought provoking point.

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:20.500
But we urge you, brothers, to go on doing so in fuller measure.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:25.500
Oh, so that applies to you too.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.500
You've shown it during your class.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:34.500
But I want you to think about it from time to time so you're a spiritual success.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.500
You've got to ask yourself individually, particularly.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.500
Maybe there's a couple of you wish.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:45.500
Are you doing it in fuller measure?

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.500
A lot to think about.

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:51.500
Seeing as things get more and more critical, good point.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:57.500
We need this godly expression here of our brotherly affection.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.500
We love our brothers.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.500
We forgive each other, but we have this.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.500
And it's got to get fuller.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.500
And we know you're going to do that.

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:09.500
You'll think about it.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:13.500
Just examine yourself from time to time with this blueprint.

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:17.500
Are you showing brotherly affection in fuller measure?

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:18.500
And you might get back.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.500
You know, we're all different.

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.500
I don't know your circumstances.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:29.500
Obviously, God doesn't Christ Jesus does, but some might say,

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:34.500
boy, she's just filled with brotherly affection.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.500
Amazing.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:40.500
I don't remember that about her before.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:45.500
Or him, no, so the sisters don't want to feel like I'm picking on you.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:52.500
The same applies to the brothers, but love brotherly affection, fuller measure.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.500
Something to think about from time to time.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:20:01.500
Now, back here in Peter's second letter,

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:08.779
this is the last thought that he puts into the blueprint

00:20:08.779 --> 00:20:11.779
to your godly devotion, brotherly affection,

00:20:11.779 --> 00:20:14.779
and then notice to your brotherly affection, love.

00:20:14.779 --> 00:20:17.779
So that has reference to agape.

00:20:17.779 --> 00:20:22.779
So brotherly affection is a unique expression on brothers

00:20:22.779 --> 00:20:23.779
that love for them.

00:20:23.779 --> 00:20:27.779
But this is a principled love, as you know.

00:20:27.779 --> 00:20:29.779
So it's governed by principle.

00:20:29.779 --> 00:20:33.779
And that's the kind of love we need to keep on preaching.

00:20:33.779 --> 00:20:38.779
Because people are going to get more and more distinct

00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:40.779
with their contempt for us.

00:20:40.779 --> 00:20:43.779
It's growing in most countries.

00:20:43.779 --> 00:20:47.779
Well, the agape's going to move us to keep on going.

00:20:47.779 --> 00:20:49.779
No matter how they mistreat us,

00:20:50.779 --> 00:20:54.779
and what they say or do, we're going to show love

00:20:54.779 --> 00:20:57.779
until Jehovah says that's it.

00:20:57.779 --> 00:20:59.779
No more preaching.

00:20:59.779 --> 00:21:01.779
And think about our time right now,

00:21:01.779 --> 00:21:04.779
because of this threat there in these national security problems

00:21:04.779 --> 00:21:08.779
in different countries, metropolitan preaching in many countries.

00:21:08.779 --> 00:21:10.779
It's not happening.

00:21:10.779 --> 00:21:14.130
Mm-hmm.

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:15.130
Door to doors.

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:17.130
And problems.

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:19.130
Memorial campaign.

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:22.130
Different things going on.

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:26.130
Jehovah has given a spirit to the governing body

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:29.130
to try to do the right thing, respect Caesar,

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:32.130
and obey him as our ruler.

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:36.130
He makes you think, what are they inactive?

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:40.130
Or others that have known about the tool, what are they thinking?

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:45.539
Well, we hope the best for them, but you better move.

00:21:45.539 --> 00:21:47.539
This is a serious business.

00:21:47.539 --> 00:21:52.539
We hope that God's going to help us to try to reach out to him.

00:21:52.539 --> 00:21:54.539
And that was the time for action,

00:21:54.539 --> 00:21:56.539
because the day's coming.

00:21:56.539 --> 00:21:58.539
That's it.

00:21:58.539 --> 00:21:59.539
It's over.

00:21:59.539 --> 00:22:03.539
Once a great tribulation breaks out, that's it.

00:22:03.539 --> 00:22:04.539
Can you help?

00:22:04.539 --> 00:22:05.539
Mm-hmm.

00:22:05.539 --> 00:22:06.539
It's over for him.

00:22:06.539 --> 00:22:14.539
So those are the nine parts of the blueprint for spiritual success.

00:22:15.539 --> 00:22:17.539
Notice the thought here.

00:22:17.539 --> 00:22:19.539
And that's what we want to conclude with.

00:22:19.539 --> 00:22:21.539
Verse eight.

00:22:21.539 --> 00:22:24.539
For if these things exist in you,

00:22:24.539 --> 00:22:28.539
now notice, and overflow,

00:22:28.539 --> 00:22:32.539
they will prevent you from being either inactive

00:22:32.539 --> 00:22:35.539
or unfruitful regarding the accurate knowledge

00:22:35.539 --> 00:22:37.539
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:22:37.539 --> 00:22:39.539
So there it is.

00:22:39.539 --> 00:22:41.539
So just exhorting you.

00:22:41.539 --> 00:22:43.539
Freshers once soon to graduate.

00:22:43.539 --> 00:22:46.539
Don't let it just exist.

00:22:46.539 --> 00:22:47.539
The blueprint.

00:22:47.539 --> 00:22:50.539
Let all of this overflow.

00:22:50.539 --> 00:22:55.539
And you are guaranteed to be a spiritual success.

00:22:55.539 --> 00:23:09.269
Well, we appreciate that very much, Brother Morris.

00:23:09.269 --> 00:23:11.269
Thank you for that blueprint,

00:23:11.269 --> 00:23:19.269
that guarantees success in building spirituality in ourselves and others.

00:23:19.269 --> 00:23:26.269
Now, you probably have noticed that we have some envelopes here on our table.

00:23:26.269 --> 00:23:29.269
Now, these are not ordinary envelopes.

00:23:29.269 --> 00:23:34.269
They're special envelopes containing some special items.

00:23:34.269 --> 00:23:38.269
Now, in these envelopes are your diplomas.

00:23:38.269 --> 00:23:41.269
There's a class picture in the envelopes.

00:23:41.269 --> 00:23:44.269
There's a letter from the teaching committee.

00:23:44.269 --> 00:23:48.269
And some of the envelopes contain additional letters

00:23:48.269 --> 00:23:51.269
regarding World Headquarters assignments.

00:23:51.269 --> 00:23:57.269
And there's a note indicating that you will receive a modest monetary gift

00:23:57.269 --> 00:24:01.269
deposited into your account on Monday.

00:24:01.269 --> 00:24:05.269
So some good things in these envelopes.

00:24:05.269 --> 00:24:10.269
We're confident that all of you will appreciate receiving these special envelopes.

00:24:10.269 --> 00:24:14.269
So one by one, and couple by couple,

00:24:14.269 --> 00:24:18.269
we're going to have you come up and receive your envelopes.

00:24:18.269 --> 00:24:22.269
Now, Brother David Schaeffer, a helper to the teaching committee,

00:24:22.269 --> 00:24:24.269
is going to help me here.

00:24:24.269 --> 00:24:26.269
And he's got the hard job.

00:24:26.269 --> 00:24:29.269
He has to pronounce all of these names.

00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:31.269
And the pressure that's on him,

00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:34.269
the parents and relatives are listening,

00:24:34.269 --> 00:24:37.269
and they'll know if he did it right.

00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:41.269
But all I have to do is hand the envelopes to them

00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:45.269
and give them an elbow bump.

00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:50.269
That's our modified handshake as recommended by the health department.

00:24:50.269 --> 00:24:54.269
So we're going to have you come up and please, Brother Schaeffer.

00:24:54.269 --> 00:24:57.269
So first we have Brother and Sister Akiyama,

00:24:57.269 --> 00:25:00.269
and they will be returning to Brazil.

00:25:00.269 --> 00:25:10.660
And next we have Brother and Sister Arthur,

and they will be returning to Ghana.

Next we have Brother and Sister Asenoff,

00:25:23.299 --> 00:25:36.380

Brother Metz will be returning to the Dominican Republic.

Brother McKeeze will be returning to South Africa.

00:28:21.579 --> 00:28:31.599
Brother Insister Moacile will be returning to Kenya.

00:28:31.599 --> 00:28:40.180
Brother Ngoy will be returning to Congo, Kinshasa.

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:52.599

Brother Parker will now be serving in the United States.

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:11.619
Brother Insister Potilantakis will be returning to Greece.

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:22.670
Brother Insister Rafaeli will now be serving in Angola.

00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:31.660
Sister Raj Kanu will be returning to India.

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:43.200
Brother Insister Sada Alp will be returning to Turkey.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:59.059
Brother Insister Susana will now be serving in Madagascar.

00:29:59.059 --> 00:30:07.980
Brother Vyutmula will be returning to Germany.

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:22.089
And finally, Brother Insister Zetaend will be returning to the Netherlands.

00:30:22.089 --> 00:30:26.289
I think we were really getting into that elbow, Bob, or way.

00:30:26.289 --> 00:30:32.890
Although that will wear you down after all of those bumps.

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:36.369
But we try to follow the good example

00:30:36.369 --> 00:30:40.170
and that they're recommending with the health department.

00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:44.289
And we're so happy to have been able to give those special envelopes

00:30:44.289 --> 00:30:46.450
to all these dear ones.

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:48.930
The governing body is very happy to give them.

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:53.650
And we know that you all are very happy to have received them

00:30:53.690 --> 00:31:00.170
and to have reached the spiritual milestone in your theocratic career.

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:04.450
In fact, now we're not going to call you Gilead students.

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:08.609
No longer students, we're going to call you Gilead graduates

00:31:08.609 --> 00:31:11.730
because you have now your diplomas.

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:19.049
But now let's raise our curtain and get a look at the entire 148th class

00:31:19.049 --> 00:31:44.769
of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.

00:31:44.769 --> 00:31:49.890
That was a nice applause you gave to yourself.

00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:52.529
I got to tease them a little bit.

00:31:52.529 --> 00:31:54.809
But what a nice-looking group.

00:31:54.809 --> 00:31:58.170
Those smiling faces, a handsome group.

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:01.970
And if you look very closely, they look quite a bit smarter

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:04.730
than they did five months ago.

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:07.450
They've learned a lot during this time.

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:10.609
But while you're looking at this beautiful group,

00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:15.410
permit me please to give a few statistics to give you an overview.

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:20.730
Now, so you don't try to quickly count, we have 55 students,

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:24.089
or 55 graduates.

00:32:24.089 --> 00:32:25.609
I can't say that anymore.

00:32:25.609 --> 00:32:30.769
55 graduates of this 148th class of Gilead.

00:32:30.769 --> 00:32:38.809
And that includes 20 couples, 11 single brothers, four single sisters.

00:32:38.849 --> 00:32:42.450
The average age is 40.1.

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:45.450
That sounds young to me.

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:48.690
It's amazing, everything changes.

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:54.890
But the youngest 30.7, the oldest 56.1.

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:59.130
The average year's baptized 24.6.

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:03.490
The average year's in the full-time service, 17.9.

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:07.329
The average year's in special full-time service, 13.1.

00:33:07.329 --> 00:33:08.529
And listen to this.

00:33:08.569 --> 00:33:14.049
Languages spoken by this class, 35.

00:33:14.049 --> 00:33:18.089
This is a multi-lingual class, for sure.

00:33:18.089 --> 00:33:20.329
And that makes us think of the great crowd,

00:33:20.329 --> 00:33:25.210
how they would be taken from all nations, tribes, peoples,

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:27.329
and tongues.

00:33:27.329 --> 00:33:30.609
35 languages represented here.

00:33:30.609 --> 00:33:35.369
And even though they're relatively young, as we said, average 40,

00:33:35.369 --> 00:33:37.089
but they're quite experienced.

00:33:37.089 --> 00:33:42.369
Because on average, they have spent 73% of the time

00:33:42.369 --> 00:33:46.890
since they've been baptized in the full-time service.

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:49.410
So just about three quarters of the time,

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:53.329
since they've been baptized, they've been in the full-time service.

00:33:53.329 --> 00:34:03.009
But now we're going to have our class letter, read by brother Musa Muassili.

00:34:03.009 --> 00:34:06.289
And you can see now why I had brother Shaffer pronounce all the names.

00:34:06.289 --> 00:34:09.969
But this is brother Musa Muassili.

00:34:09.969 --> 00:34:12.650
And he's going back to Kenya.

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:25.079
And he's going to read the letter from the class.

00:34:25.079 --> 00:34:30.159
To the governing body and the United States, the Bethel family,

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:35.960
dear brothers, from the moment we received the invitation to Giriad,

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:39.760
we eagerly anticipated what was to come.

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:44.079
Now, after five unforgettable months,

00:34:44.079 --> 00:34:47.360
we fully agree with the job whose words,

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:50.800
my ears have heard about you.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:56.800
But now, I do see you with my eyes.

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:59.960
By means of our deepest thought of God's word,

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:05.920
we have seen Jehovah's amazing qualities on fully display.

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:09.239
The way he shows love and care for his people

00:35:09.239 --> 00:35:14.199
has been embedded in our minds and hearts.

00:35:14.199 --> 00:35:20.840
We are determined to continue to imitate his example.

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:23.559
As soon as we came to school,

00:35:23.559 --> 00:35:27.719
the Bethel family quickly endeared themselves to us

00:35:27.719 --> 00:35:31.960
by their warmth, hospitality, and love.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:35.400
Their self-sacrificing example

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:40.119
is one we will all cherish and take with us

00:35:40.119 --> 00:35:43.599
when going to our assignments.

00:35:43.599 --> 00:35:48.760
We have come to dearly love our instructors.

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:52.679
Each day, they have put their heart and soul

00:35:52.679 --> 00:35:54.440
into their teaching.

00:35:54.440 --> 00:36:00.239
And we felt they are genuinely love and concern for us.

00:36:00.239 --> 00:36:03.119
By means of divine instruction,

00:36:03.119 --> 00:36:08.360
we have seen Jehovah, our grand instructor,

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:11.880
and his spirit directed the organization

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:16.239
in new and faithless, strengthening ways.

00:36:16.239 --> 00:36:22.440
We have been taught to dig into God's word like never before.

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:28.920
And we are deserved to apply what we have learned.

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:32.840
Observing the tireless work and unselfish spirit

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:36.599
that the members of the governing body display

00:36:36.599 --> 00:36:40.599
motivates us to imitate their faith.

00:36:40.599 --> 00:36:44.719
Our hearts are filled with a deeper gratitude

00:36:44.719 --> 00:36:48.599
when we think about to the manifestes,

00:36:48.599 --> 00:36:52.199
loving instruction, and personal attention

00:36:52.199 --> 00:36:55.679
that was generously provided.

00:36:55.679 --> 00:37:00.440
We have seen and felt that they are love and concern for us

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:04.840
and how they unitedly worked together.

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:08.960
They have instilled in us a greater desire

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:14.440
to imitate the head of the congregation, Jesus Christ.

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:19.760
They truly have approved to be gifted from Jehovah

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:26.159
and have become so beloved to us.

00:37:26.159 --> 00:37:29.199
Although there are a unique circumstances

00:37:29.199 --> 00:37:32.480
surrounding this graduation program,

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:35.599
we are not disheartened.

00:37:35.599 --> 00:37:39.920
Rather, we are confident.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:44.840
We feel strongly we are witnessing clear evidence

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:50.239
of you being faithful and discreet.

00:37:50.239 --> 00:37:53.760
We have the utmost confidence and respect

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:59.159
in the direction you provide during these momentous times.

00:38:00.159 --> 00:38:06.840
We praise our greatest God, Jehovah, for the gift of Bulgaria.

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:11.800
We express our sincere appreciation

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:16.800
and deep love to each one of you.

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:29.429
You are brothers and sisters, one forty-eighth the cross of Bulgaria.

00:38:29.429 --> 00:38:35.190
Sorry, brother Osily, I forgot to give you your elbow, Bob.

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:37.230
Sorry about that.

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:41.230
But I took the letter and I'll make sure the governing body

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:42.389
gets this beautiful letter.

00:38:42.389 --> 00:38:43.869
What a beautiful letter.

00:38:43.869 --> 00:38:49.670
It nicely expresses your feelings about being at Gilead.

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:51.550
And you say you enjoyed being here.

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:55.389
Well, we say we enjoyed having you.

00:38:55.389 --> 00:39:00.349
It was truly a mutual interchange of encouragement,

00:39:00.349 --> 00:39:04.309
as mentioned in Romans chapter 1 and verse number 12.

00:39:04.309 --> 00:39:08.269
And brother Musa did a beautiful job.

00:39:08.269 --> 00:39:12.869
That was actually his first speaking assignment as a Gilead graduate.

00:39:12.869 --> 00:39:15.190
But he really did a good job, didn't he?

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:15.909
It was really good.

00:39:15.909 --> 00:39:18.630
He's going to do wonderful things in the future,

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:21.630
with Jehovah's help, just like all of you.

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:24.590
But we've really had a good time having you.

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:29.909
But now I get to talk five more minutes to you, one more time here.

00:39:29.909 --> 00:39:36.710
And if you recall, in the opening discussion of our program,

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:42.429
we talked about four areas in which we can imitate Jesus' modesty.

00:39:42.429 --> 00:39:47.429
Well, briefly, let's talk about one more aspect of modesty

00:39:47.429 --> 00:39:53.630
that is closely related to being aware of our own limitations.

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:58.030
And that is, being aware of the limitations of others.

00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:01.630
And again, our role model Jesus set a perfect example

00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:04.550
in this aspect of modesty.

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:06.909
A ponder for a moment, if you will,

00:40:06.909 --> 00:40:10.869
what is stated at Matthew chapter 3 verse 16?

00:40:10.869 --> 00:40:15.030
It talks about how after Jesus was baptized,

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:17.230
he came up out of the water,

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:22.190
and then it says, the heavens were opened up.

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:23.750
What does that mean?

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:26.750
Well, the greatest man book makes this comment,

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:31.909
evidently it means that while he is being baptized,

00:40:31.909 --> 00:40:37.869
the memory of his pre-human life in heaven returns to him.

00:40:37.869 --> 00:40:44.550
Thus Jesus now fully recalls his life as a spirit son of Jehovah God,

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:49.469
including all the things that God spoke to him in heaven

00:40:49.469 --> 00:40:53.269
during his pre-human existence.

00:40:53.269 --> 00:40:55.190
Now that's an amazing comment, isn't it?

00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:59.989
Can you just imagine flooding into the perfect human brain

00:40:59.989 --> 00:41:05.070
of Jesus, the memory of billions of years

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:10.230
of pre-human existence, eons and eons of time,

00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:13.110
a countless, countless experiences

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:17.510
as he served as a master worker beside Jehovah,

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:21.789
as he served as the prince of Jehovah's Army,

00:41:21.789 --> 00:41:24.550
as he served as Jehovah's spokesman,

00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:27.909
as he served as Michael the Archangel.

00:41:27.909 --> 00:41:29.550
Now if you think about it,

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:34.349
that would have been the greatest download of information

00:41:34.349 --> 00:41:37.349
that has had ever happened, see.

00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:41.789
But here's the point, and like Jesus,

00:41:41.789 --> 00:41:44.309
you received download here at Gilead, right?

00:41:45.309 --> 00:41:46.869
Nothing like what Jesus got,

00:41:46.869 --> 00:41:50.909
but you had a tremendous five month download, didn't you?

00:41:50.909 --> 00:41:53.989
But the point is, how did Jesus use

00:41:53.989 --> 00:41:57.230
all of this newly acquired voluminous,

00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:01.750
tremendous knowledge that he received?

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:05.550
How did he use it in his dealings with others?

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:08.190
Well, he never overwhelmed them

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:11.309
with impressive displays of knowledge.

00:42:11.309 --> 00:42:13.070
Now he could have done that, couldn't he?

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:14.349
Never did that.

00:42:14.349 --> 00:42:19.510
He was always very aware of their limitations.

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:21.230
Very considered, very thoughtful.

00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:23.869
And remember what he said to his disciples,

00:42:23.869 --> 00:42:27.349
as recorded at John chapter 16, verse 12,

00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:29.349
he said to them,

00:42:29.349 --> 00:42:32.070
I still have many things to say to you,

00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:36.590
but you are not able to bear them now.

00:42:37.389 --> 00:42:39.590
Now it was very thoughtful one of their limitations,

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:43.070
even though he had all this tremendous knowledge.

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:46.190
So what a good example for us.

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:50.030
Additionally, even though he was perfect,

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:52.469
he was not a perfectionist.

00:42:52.469 --> 00:42:55.670
In other words, he didn't require perfection of others.

00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:59.150
He allowed for the mistakes, the shortcomings,

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:01.829
the weaknesses of others.

00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:04.750
And if you think about this, many other ways,

00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:07.070
he was sensitive, he was compassionate

00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:10.750
regarding the limitations of others.

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:14.309
Just one more example, he knew his disciples at times

00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:18.550
needed to get away from the crowds and rest.

00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:22.789
Well, how can you dear Gilead graduates

00:43:22.789 --> 00:43:25.429
imitate Jesus' modesty

00:43:25.429 --> 00:43:28.269
in being aware of the limitations of others?

00:43:28.269 --> 00:43:29.030
Well, as we've mentioned,

00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:32.429
you had a tremendous five-month download of information,

00:43:32.429 --> 00:43:36.630
but please use it modestly.

00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:41.389
Use it in a way that you never put more on others

00:43:41.389 --> 00:43:43.230
and they can bear.

00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:46.989
Use it in a way that you realize their limitations, see?

00:43:46.989 --> 00:43:49.909
Everyone has limitations, some more than others,

00:43:49.909 --> 00:43:52.590
but being aware of that.

00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:56.230
A little by little, share the good things you've learned

00:43:56.230 --> 00:44:01.190
with these ones and always never put,

00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:04.750
be aware to never put more on them than they can bear.

00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:08.789
There's a saying by the mile is a trial,

00:44:08.789 --> 00:44:13.590
by the yard is hard, but inch by inch is a cinch.

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:18.590
So just little by little, share and help the ones

00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:21.590
in your territory, your congregation, your Bethel family,

00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:23.469
help them to benefit from the good things

00:44:23.469 --> 00:44:25.590
you've learned these last five months.

00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:30.550
And please, by all means, allow for the imperfections

00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:32.710
and shortcomings of others.

00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:36.789
If the perfect one was not a perfectionist,

00:44:36.789 --> 00:44:39.989
then even more so, we as all imperfect ones,

00:44:39.989 --> 00:44:44.230
surely we can allow for imperfection of others.

00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:46.550
And we know you're gonna be determined to do that.

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:49.869
And please be sensitive and compassionate,

00:44:49.869 --> 00:44:54.869
concerning the physical, emotional limitations of others

00:44:54.869 --> 00:44:56.750
as Jesus was.

00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:02.110
But now, we've discussed all together five areas

00:45:02.110 --> 00:45:06.630
in which we can imitate Jesus modesty in quick review.

00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:10.190
We talk about, we need to always remember,

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:15.190
we have authority limitations and try hard to stay in balance.

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:21.510
Two, we have to remember our lesser importance,

00:45:21.869 --> 00:45:26.869
compared to Jehovah's vastly greater importance.

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:29.989
Three, we have to remember there's something

00:45:29.989 --> 00:45:33.829
we're simply not entitled to know, at least not now,

00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:35.510
and then some things may be never.

00:45:36.909 --> 00:45:40.949
Number four, we want to be aware of always

00:45:40.949 --> 00:45:45.949
fully relying on Jehovah and never ourselves.

00:45:46.789 --> 00:45:49.070
And the number five is we just discuss

00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:52.550
always being aware of the limitations of others.

00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:56.469
If we imitate Jesus modesty in these five areas,

00:45:56.469 --> 00:45:58.750
Jehovah will love us dearly.

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:04.230
As he dearly loves his modest son,

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:05.869
he'll love us the same way.

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:10.030
And wherever we go, whatever privileges we have,

00:46:10.989 --> 00:46:15.989
we will always be refreshing to others as Jesus was.

00:46:33.449 --> 00:46:38.449
But now, in imitation of what is done on the JW broadcast,

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:43.449
they have a postcard at the end, don't they?

00:46:43.449 --> 00:46:47.650
So we're going to have a postcard coming from the class,

00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:51.730
the 148th class of Gilead.

00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:54.210
Send them a postcard, send them, please,

00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:55.610
your love and affection.

00:46:56.969 --> 00:46:59.969
They send you warm love and affection

00:46:59.969 --> 00:47:04.050
from the 148th class of Gilead.

00:47:05.409 --> 00:47:08.090
So that's a lot of love that they sent.

00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:13.090
And we finished by saying from the 148th class

00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:16.610
of Gilead in the Patterson Auditorium,

00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:20.210
this is JW Broadcasting.
