00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.300
Okay kids, it's time to practice our Bible books.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.300
Are you ready to try the Greek Scriptures?

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.300
Great!

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.300
Matthew!

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.300
How Jesus came to earth and taught us all.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.300
Mark!

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.300
Miracles show Jesus is God's Son.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.579
We can learn from all the stories Jesus told.

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:30.579
John!

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.579
Like Lazarus, the dead can live again.

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:35.579
Ask!

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.579
How kingdom preaching spread throughout the world.

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:40.579
Romans!

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.579
Explaining how God's mercy reaches all.

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.579
Praise the Corinthians!

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.579
It teaches us what true love really is.

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.579
Second Corinthians!

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.579
God loves us when we're willing to forgive.

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.579
Galatians!

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.280
Do good to everyone and don't give up.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.280
It teaches us how family life should be.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.359
Focused on what's true and good and right.

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:09.359
Galatians!

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:13.359
Obedience brings joy as you'll see.

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:14.359
First as the low ends.

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:17.359
Any time, anywhere, we can pray.

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:23.180
No matter what Jehovah helps his friends.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.659
He knew the Holy Scriptures from his youth.

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.700
He bravely helped the congregation grow.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.700
The elders need to know how much we care.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.099
His former slave became his Christian friend.

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:46.900
Need our weekly meetings one and all.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.180
All good gifts and perfect presents come from God.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.180
First Peter!

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.180
Christ left a model we must imitate.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:16.020
Our Jehovah wants his people to be clean and hospitality.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.469
It's right.

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:22.469
Revelation!

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:26.469
Tells how the paradise will come to be.
