00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:13.519
I've been an insecure and reserved person since childhood.

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.399
When I finished school, my report said that I was unable to express myself and that I

00:00:18.399 --> 00:00:22.129
had a limited vocabulary.

00:00:22.129 --> 00:00:25.850
These words injured my already low self-esteem.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:33.140
So I started to wonder, what am I living for?

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.039
During my teenage years, I began to drink alcohol.

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:40.320
Life seemed meaningless to me.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:49.909
I felt depressed and started to have suicidal thoughts.

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:53.590
When I was around 20, I became obsessed with hard rock.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:00.100
This music really charged me with energy.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.899
I loved its roughness and rapidness.

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.670
It whipped me into a frenzy.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.269
In time, I became rude and aggressive.

00:01:11.269 --> 00:01:14.950
I often quarreled with those close to me.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.870
This of course did not bring me happiness.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.750
I started to have suicidal thoughts again, but serious ones this time.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.510
The only thing that stopped me was the thought that my mom would not survive it.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.709
I tried to take my mind off these thoughts and I began to want to do something for God.

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:40.709
For the first time in my life, I poured out my heart to God in prayer.

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:44.790
I asked Him to help me find my purpose in life.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.829
Just two hours later, Jehovah's Witnesses knocked on my door and offered a Bible study.

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:56.969
That's how my new, happy life began.

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.609
Although it wasn't easy for me, I got rid of everything that was related to hard rock

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:03.810
and alcohol.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.689
I thought that I would never be able to tell others about my faith.

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.650
At the same time, however, I understood that people needed to hear about it.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.650
To my surprise, my preaching gave me confidence.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.610
It also strengthened my faith.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.849
Now I have a good family.

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.090
I'm happy that I've been able to help people, including my sister and mom, to learn the

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.889
truth from the Bible.

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:36.530
Throughout my life as a Christian, Jehovah's words at Hebrews 13.5 have greatly supported

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.610
me.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.930
I will never leave you and I will never abandon you.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.409
But He didn't abandon me, even when I did not know Him.
