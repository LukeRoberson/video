00:00:06.219 --> 00:00:15.220
Growing up in the truth, I felt like I fit in more with my friends at school or people who weren't witnesses.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:24.219
I was living a double life and I knew it. I was not baptized. I had always tried to make the truth fit in with the world.

00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:28.219
And this time I decided I just want to give the world a shot and see what that's like.

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:33.219
I came right to my parents and I said I want to move to LA and pursue modeling.

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:36.219
I had my first job within the week.

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:55.570
It looks so glamorous. There's a lot of parties going to the coolest houses, getting to hang out with celebrities.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:02.570
There are new rules. You have the money to do whatever you want.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.569
That lifestyle was so far from what I was raised knowing I was right.

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:11.569
That I basically had no relationship with Jehovah.

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:16.569
Once all the smoke and mirrors are gone, you see these things for what they are.

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:19.569
I remember I called my mom and I told her it's like Sodom and Gomorrah.

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:21.569
I'm literally in the middle of it all.

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:25.569
And I thought like this is it. This is what everyone says is the best.

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:29.569
And I'm not happy and I just felt so dull, empty.

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:34.569
I actually thought to myself, I wish I was never raised a witness.

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:37.569
I wish I never even knew Jehovah existed.

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:41.569
There were certain nights where I needed him.

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:43.569
I was thinking just pray, just go to him.

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:54.519
And I couldn't. I thought I would never be able to come back to Jehovah.

00:01:54.519 --> 00:01:58.519
One of the jobs I got hired to do was work for this young fashion company.

00:01:58.519 --> 00:02:05.980
In between different outfits and shoots, you would just, you know, you talk with a photographer.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.980
What are you guys going to be for Halloween?

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.979
Bad doesn't celebrate Halloween.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.979
It's not a Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:12.979
So am I.

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:14.979
It's not a joke.

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:17.979
No, I'm not. I mean, I was raised as witness.

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:19.979
Yeah, I was raised as well.

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:21.979
Do you go to meetings?

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:23.979
No, I haven't been in forever.

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:24.979
What about you?

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:26.979
No, I haven't.

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:29.979
I got a last minute job to New York.

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:32.979
I decided to walk the Brooklyn Bridge.

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:35.979
I knew Bethel was there and I'd never been to Bethel.

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:39.979
The sister stopped me on my tour and she invited me up to her office.

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:42.979
There were different paintings of the resurrection.

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:44.979
She asked me, you know what?

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:48.979
The people are waiting on the balcony and I was like, I don't know why.

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:53.979
And she said, because they're waiting for their loved ones to be resurrected.

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:59.770
It was as if something just went straight to my heart.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.770
I've never felt something like that.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.770
I had for the first time actually seen the resurrection and believed it.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.770
It wasn't just the saying that might happen.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:09.770
It was for sure.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.770
I knew exactly what it was going to look like.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.770
I would be standing there pulling that balcony, looking for my loved ones to come back.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.099
I had to be there.

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.099
The resurrection.

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.099
It's so real to me.

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:29.099
The second I got out of Bethel, I...

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.099
I called my mom and I told her in slaves of law.

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.900
Mom was coming back.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.900
I know exactly what he needed to do.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.900
I've come back to Jehovah.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.750
I had made up my mind, you know, I'm going to give Jehovah a chance.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.750
But, you know, I'm coming back to truth.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.750
I'm going to do it right.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:58.750
There was an elder who was doing the watchtower and he just came off so kind that I thought, you know, when the speeding ends, I want to talk with him.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.750
And I'm going to explain to him why I'm here.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.750
I knew I had so many changes to make.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.750
Matthew 633 is so important to me.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.750
Seek first the kingdom.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.750
My entire life, I saw everything I was before Jehovah.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.750
I never put him first.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.750
And I, for the first time, was saying, okay, Jehovah, I'm going to put you first.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:27.750
The job I have right now isn't necessarily my dream job, but it allows me to do exactly what I want to do for Jehovah.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.750
And that's fine here.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.750
I used to walk down Hollywood Boulevard going from casting to casting with my portfolio in hand.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.750
And now I walk down Hollywood Boulevard with a car from my hand.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.750
Out in the ministry, I see models that I used to work with.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.750
And I love getting to show them this is my new life.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.750
And this has changed my life.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:46.750
I am so happy.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.750
I know what it's like to superficially feel good.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:56.750
But to literally have the joy, the happiness, I want to share that with everybody.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.470
Jehovah completely changed my life.
