00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.199
Do you know why all of us are alive today?

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:38.060
It is thanks to a faithful man who walked with God a long time ago.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.780
His name was Noah.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.359
The Bible in Genesis chapter 6 tells us that many years ago,

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.840
about 600 years after the first man Adam died,

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.920
some angels looked down from heaven upon the earth

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.920
and noticed the women.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:30.319
They saw that they were very pretty and those angels

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:38.459
began to have bad thoughts. They left heaven and became like men

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:45.260
so that they could marry the women. This was unnatural and very wrong.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.819
The women then had babies who grew up to be giant bullies

00:01:49.819 --> 00:02:02.530
called Nephilim. These bullies beat up people.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.010
Many men copied their bad example,

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:21.979
doubtless, even children became bullies.

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:32.000
People in that violent world ignored the suffering around them.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:43.840
They were enjoying life, marrying, eating and drinking.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:53.460
They were buying and selling and did not care about God.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:03:03.099
Violence was everywhere.

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:08.400
Innocent people were being attacked.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.759
Now, what did Jehovah God think about that wicked world?

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:18.939
He saw that the badness of men was everywhere

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:24.689
and that what they thought about was only bad all the time.

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:32.419
Jehovah felt hurt that men were wicked.

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:39.300
What did God decide to do about it? He said,

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:51.150
I am going to wipe mankind from the face of the earth.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.150
Did this mean that nobody would be left on the earth?

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.990
No.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.150
The Bible tells us that during this time of violence,

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.909
at least one man obeyed God.

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:14.139
Noah. This God-fearing man and his wife had three sons.

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.699
Probably the first born was Jehovah.

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:56.850
The next son was Shem and was the youngest.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.370
These obedient sons and their faithful wives

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.209
would be a great help to Noah in a special task

00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:25.629
that God would soon give him to do.

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:29.069
Why did Jehovah favor Noah?

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:34.430
What made him special?

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.910
Noah was a faithful man who walked with God

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:44.160
by serving him from day to day.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.680
He was different from the rest of mankind.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:06:01.980
He obeyed God. How would Jehovah destroy that wicked world?

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.379
He said,

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:09.980
I am going to cause a huge flood to cleanse the earth.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:23.339
The water will be so deep that everything will drown.

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:26.620
But what about the birds and the animals?

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.540
And what about faithful Noah and his family?

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.139
Jehovah gave Noah special instructions

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:38.660
on how to build a life-saving ark.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.699
What would it look like?

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:47.339
It would look like a huge oblong box.

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:49.339
It would be long and narrow

00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:51.980
with a flat bottom and square ends.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:07:00.240
They had to clear a large area

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:07.870
in order to measure out the ground plan for this huge ark.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:12.110
Can you imagine how big it would be?

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.550
It would be over 400 feet long,

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.589
much longer than a football field,

00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:21.310
about 70 feet wide,

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:29.009
and as high as a four-story house.

00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:31.730
Noah probably built it near a forest

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.199
where wood was easy to get.

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:37.680
But how would Noah and his family

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.920
only eight persons

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.199
build such a massive vessel?

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:45.920
It was something they had never done before.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:08:20.500
If God's help,

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:26.079
they were able to build the ark.

00:08:26.079 --> 00:08:28.079
Besides doing this work,

00:08:28.079 --> 00:08:32.080
they had another important task to do.

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:36.559
They had to warn their neighbors about the coming flood.

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:38.399
Can you imagine how those people

00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:41.039
might have reacted to their preaching?

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:46.750
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:48.590
They probably said,

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:52.529
you fools!

00:08:52.529 --> 00:08:57.100
Why are you building this huge box here?

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.740
You're wasting your time!

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.179
Our world is not going to end.

00:09:04.179 --> 00:09:06.500
They ignored Noah's warning

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:13.539
and just continued in their normal daily routine.

00:09:13.539 --> 00:09:16.259
But Noah listened to God,

00:09:16.259 --> 00:09:22.259
not to his neighbors.

00:09:22.259 --> 00:09:24.340
It took him and his family

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:28.019
a long time to build the ark.

00:09:28.019 --> 00:09:30.259
For over 40 years,

00:09:30.259 --> 00:09:32.980
they obediently worked hard at it.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:57.970
At long last,

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:00.769
the ark was completed.

00:10:00.769 --> 00:10:03.250
They had made it waterproof.

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:05.090
For light and fresh air,

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:08.850
they had put a window opening all around.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.570
They also made a large door in its side.

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:18.289
In preparation for their long stay in the ark,

00:10:18.289 --> 00:10:21.570
Noah and his family had to prepare fruits,

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:24.210
grains, and other foods.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:27.250
They had to store water to sustain themselves

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:32.350
and many kinds of animals and birds.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:36.179
But they were not yet finished.

00:10:36.179 --> 00:10:39.379
They now had to face another challenge,

00:10:39.379 --> 00:10:46.669
an urgent job.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:50.990
Genesis chapter 7 tells us that Noah and his family

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:57.120
started to lead all the different kinds of animals into the ark.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.600
They only had a short time to do it.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.279
Why?

00:11:01.279 --> 00:11:04.159
Because God said,

00:11:04.159 --> 00:11:06.399
in just seven days more,

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:08.879
I am making it rain upon the earth

00:11:08.879 --> 00:11:14.289
for 40 days and 40 nights.

00:11:14.289 --> 00:11:16.850
The whole earth will be flooded

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:23.580
and I will wipe out every breathing thing.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.019
Therefore,

00:11:25.019 --> 00:11:28.220
take into the ark seven each of the clean animals

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:35.070
to be used in my worship.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:36.830
Of the other kinds,

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:38.350
take to each.

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:47.789
Jehovah must have helped Noah

00:11:47.789 --> 00:11:48.509
to direct them,

00:11:48.509 --> 00:12:31.889
any kinds of animals that had to be led into the ark.

00:12:31.889 --> 00:12:35.360
Not even the little,

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:39.730
the creeping ones slow.

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:50.429
Or waste any time.

00:12:50.429 --> 00:12:51.629
Did he think,

00:12:51.629 --> 00:12:55.149
well, this can all wait until tomorrow?

00:12:55.149 --> 00:12:56.909
No.

00:12:56.909 --> 00:13:01.629
He did, according to all that Jehovah had commanded him.

00:13:01.629 --> 00:13:03.629
It wasn't easy.

00:13:03.629 --> 00:13:04.990
But once again,

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:08.029
he and his family showed that they were god-fearing

00:13:08.029 --> 00:13:10.429
and obedient.

00:13:10.429 --> 00:13:12.909
They did just so.

00:13:12.909 --> 00:13:27.889
All the animals were safely inside.

00:13:27.889 --> 00:13:51.919
Jehovah shut the door.

00:13:51.919 --> 00:13:55.840
Now Noah and his family had to wait.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.000
Would the flood come?

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.279
Or would they look foolish,

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:22.529
all lucked up inside the ark?

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:24.610
Just as God had said,

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:38.029
the heavens burst open.

00:14:38.029 --> 00:14:41.230
It rained and it rained without stopping.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:43.470
It was a deluge.

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:53.200
Poured down for 40 days and 40 nights.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.480
Yes,

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.720
Jehovah kept his word.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:07.309
Waters rose higher and higher.

00:15:07.309 --> 00:15:09.070
Imagine how all felt

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:23.679
when the ark started to float and rock.

00:15:23.679 --> 00:15:25.679
The animals were scared.

00:15:25.679 --> 00:15:27.679
They had no idea what was happening.

00:15:27.679 --> 00:15:44.580
The unturized slowly with the waters.

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:47.860
Eventually, even the highest mountains were covered.

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:55.620
The earth was flooded for 150 days.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:58.580
What happened to all the wicked, violent people

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:02.179
who had scoffed at Noah's warning?

00:16:02.179 --> 00:16:08.350
They drowned.

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:11.629
During all the months that the ark floated,

00:16:11.629 --> 00:16:14.669
Noah and his family were kept busy.

00:16:14.669 --> 00:16:17.389
They cared for their own needs.

00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:19.389
And for those of the animals.

00:16:19.389 --> 00:17:06.819
Only the animals in the ark and Noah and his family were saved.

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:11.380
Eight people survived because they listened to Jehovah

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:14.660
and did as he commanded.

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:22.400
They did just so.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.359
God caused a wind to pass over the earth

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:27.359
to dry it out.

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:29.519
The waters began to drop,

00:17:29.519 --> 00:17:35.839
forming oceans, seas, lakes and rivers.

00:17:35.839 --> 00:17:41.900
Imagine how Noah and his family must have felt

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:45.660
when the ark suddenly settled on the mountains of Adorant.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:18:06.190
Up and next.

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:10.430
Genesis chapter eight says that Noah sent out a raven

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:12.910
to see if there was any dry land nearby.

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:18.960
But it kept coming back.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:26.130
There was no place for it to land.

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:33.730
Later, Noah released a dove.

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:45.839
But no matter how far it searched, there were no trees.

00:18:45.839 --> 00:18:49.759
Like the raven, it also came back.

00:18:49.759 --> 00:18:54.079
Seven days later, Noah sent the dove out again.

00:18:54.079 --> 00:19:00.240
It came back with a freshly plucked olive leaf in its beak.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:04.240
Noah now knew that some trees were visible again.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:09.740
Eventually, the earth dried off.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:16.619
Noah now waited for Jehovah's next command.

00:19:16.619 --> 00:19:19.740
God said, go out of the ark,

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:31.519
you and all your family and all the birds and animals.

00:19:31.519 --> 00:19:36.000
How would you have felt after surviving the flood?

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:45.039
You would have been very thankful to God.

00:19:45.039 --> 00:19:48.240
And that's just how Noah and his family felt.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:20:14.480
They were so grateful that they built an altar to Jehovah.

00:20:14.559 --> 00:20:18.480
They offered sacrifices of thanksgiving upon it.

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:22.559
God was very pleased with Noah's thankful worship.

00:20:22.559 --> 00:20:39.740
Noah and his family were overjoyed because Jehovah had saved them.

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:52.079
Jehovah now blessed them and told them to have children

00:20:52.079 --> 00:20:54.880
and spread across the earth.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:21:06.210
In time, Noah's sons and their wives had families.

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:10.690
The animals also had their little ones.

00:21:10.769 --> 00:21:17.650
Thus, the human and animal population began to spread over all the earth.

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:43.869
Jehovah made a solemn promise to Noah and to the rest of mankind.

00:21:43.869 --> 00:21:49.490
Never again will I send a flood to ruin the whole earth.

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:55.490
He gave them something beautiful in the sky to help them remember his promise.

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:59.009
My rainbow, I do given the cloud,

00:21:59.009 --> 00:22:07.170
and it must serve as a sign of the agreement between me and the earth.

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:09.890
You too can be like Noah.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:11.170
How?

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:14.769
By learning from his good example.

00:22:14.769 --> 00:22:20.289
He had a strong spiritual family.

00:22:20.289 --> 00:22:29.230
Together, they had built the ark and had cared for the animals.

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:33.309
They had also preached to an unbelieving world.

00:22:33.309 --> 00:22:38.670
Yes, Noah was a preacher of righteousness.

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:45.039
Noah walked with God and now so must we.

00:22:45.039 --> 00:22:46.880
How?

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:53.119
We must preach the good news that God has promised to cleanse our world of the wicked.

00:22:53.119 --> 00:22:57.599
He will restore paradise on earth for all the good people who serve him

00:22:57.599 --> 00:23:00.880
and follow his son, Jesus.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:10.059
Then, Noah and his family will come back to life on earth.

00:23:10.059 --> 00:23:13.099
Will you and your family be there?

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.859
Will you be in paradise to talk to them?

00:23:16.859 --> 00:23:20.940
If you walk with God, you surely will.
