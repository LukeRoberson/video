00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.970
The blessings that I enjoy today are so numerous.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.489
I have a true inner sense of joy and happiness.

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:23.890
I can't help but be appreciative. So grateful for all that Jehovah does.

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.530
But it wasn't always this way for us.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:50.079
It was a dark world growing up. I never knew what being a child was like.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:03.039
I was afraid of who I would grow up to be. I felt like I had no choice.

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:10.500
I did at a very young age. I as well started to partake of what I saw going on around me.

00:01:12.019 --> 00:01:15.780
I learned quickly that it helps numb the feelings that I had.

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:22.099
Drugs were a way to escape that. I was in a lot of trouble with the law.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.260
I knew I needed change. So I joined the military at a young age.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:37.859
Around my teenage years, my life became difficult. I started to turn to drugs and alcohol and

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:41.780
self-destructive ways. But none of these things were making me happy.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.420
I was very lonely. No one knew me. No one cared to know me.

00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:57.060
I felt so lost. And I was trying to fill this big hole in my heart with so many things.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.739
And none of it worked. One of my many car accidents due to drugs and alcohol

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:17.580
ended me up in jail for 30 days straight. I felt like a hopeless mess.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.139
I just knew something's got to change.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.900
So I joined the military thinking it was going to be the positive great change that I needed.

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:32.620
But it was not.

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:40.699
I remember joining the military hoping that it would bring some sort of authority into my life.

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:48.139
But I again started to spiral into my anger, my alcohol, and drug abuse.

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:57.819
The military decided to let me out. But during deployment is where I met Holly.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.139
Holly also got out of the military and we started to live a life together.

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:10.060
But we were still searching for something to fill the emptiness that we both felt in our lives.

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:15.580
Jeremiah and I were both working in a steel factory in Montana.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.460
During this time I was being trained on a drill by one of Jova's witnesses, a sister named Molly.

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:29.099
Molly said, you're going to have downtime on this machine. Maybe a couple hours, so feel free to read

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:36.379
whatever I have in my toolbox. I opened it and immediately a little yellow book. What does it

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:42.539
Bible really teach? Cut my eye. I love the pictures, the scriptures, and the beginning of the book.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.740
They touched my heart immediately and I felt like these answer all the questions I've been

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:56.780
searching for my entire life. Another sister came over her name was Corey and she said, Molly and I

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.979
can come over and we can talk to you about the Bible tomorrow. If you have any questions, we'd love

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:09.180
to answer them using the Bible. I said, yes, come over. I was a little bit more apprehensive.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.939
I stayed just to make sure nothing got weird. But this was finally something very different

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:20.459
and I realized what they were saying came from the Bible. I've never seen that before.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:27.819
They invited us to the Kingdom Hall. We went in. Everybody had their Bible, had time to look the

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:34.300
scriptures up together and everybody was so warm and inviting. These were the people I've

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:40.779
been searching for my entire life. All of a sudden change was possible. We knew what changes we

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:46.939
needed to make in our life. What we were doing, our actions, we had to clear out things that Jehovah

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:51.259
hates. Like just going through our house and deciding what it is, do we need to get rid of?

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:56.860
By allowing the truth to transform our lives, Holly and I have received many blessings. And

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.740
eventually we were able to come here together and serve at Bethel. We got the truth in a

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:09.259
world shop and now I get to weld here in Jehovah's house for him. I perform maintenance on water

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:16.060
fountains, refrigerators, coolers. Being trained by the brothers and sisters I worked with just

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:23.899
helps me to refine my Christian personality. It's so nice to know that Jehovah is looking down on us

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:30.220
that he was able to see through all of the trash that was there in our life. He was able to find

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:37.500
something and decided to work with it. And I really think of a scripture Psalm 145 verse 19.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:46.699
He satisfies the desire of those who fear him. He hears their cries for help and rescues them.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.699
Jehovah did that for us. If you asked Jehovah to display his hand in your life,

00:05:53.339 --> 00:06:02.620
no doubt at all in my mind that will happen.
