00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:37.609

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.219

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.420

00:00:58.259 --> 00:01:07.299
No, thanks. We've really got you going next time for sure then. I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah, what was that all about?

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:10.219
It's nothing

00:01:11.019 --> 00:01:13.019
I hope not

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:29.260
Trust me. It's nothing. I can guess who that is

00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:35.750
Who's that?

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:44.069
Just a doctor from work. Wow, he's persistent. He's persistent. Wait, is he interested in you?

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:50.189
I guess when were you gonna tell me about this? There's nothing to tell you told them no, right?

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:54.069
I haven't I don't wait you haven't told him no

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.870
No

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.670
Not yet. I've taught you better than that. You know you have to be firm from the start

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:38.400
It's not that simple. It is that simple and you need to do it now. Hey, I'm sorry

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.870
I overreacted. I want you to know I do trust you

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.590
Never had a reason not to

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:52.789
I know

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.990
But I'm not a teenager anymore

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.210
You're not, but I'm always gonna be your dad

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:11.699
And dad's worry about their kids. It's just part of the job. I really need this job to pioneer

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:17.300
What if he doesn't take it well?

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:35.020
That could happen, but then you'll get to see what Jehovah will do. I'll talk with him tomorrow. Is there anything I can do to help?

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.620
Maybe say a prayer for me. I'd love to
