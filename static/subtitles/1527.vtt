00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.580
Jehovah's Witnesses love the Bible.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.580
Long before taking on the monumental task of Bible translation,

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.580
they acquired licenses to print already existing translations of the Bible.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.579
And then in the 1950s, the Watchtower Bible and Trek Society printed the first Bible

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:26.579
ever to be translated by Jehovah's Witnesses, the New World translation of the Holy Scriptures.

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:32.579
At least, we thought it was the first Bible ever to be translated by Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.579
Well, in the fall of 2017, the World Headquarters Museum, the Department received a Bible,

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.579
donated by a brother in Germany.

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:47.579
A company in the Bible was a letter referring to a rare Bible printed in 1934 at Macdeburg,

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.579
the location of the Watchtower Bible and Trek Society's Germany branch and printer at that time.

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.579
Little was known about this Bible.

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.579
And to those who didn't know of it, it was thought of as something unapproved

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.579
by the then president of the Society, J.F. Rutherford.

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:10.579
By 1934, Adolf Hitler's campaign against Jehovah's Witnesses was well underway.

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:13.579
Our religious activities were banned.

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:17.579
65 tons of literature had been seized and burned by Nazi authorities.

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:22.579
And the branch office and printer at Macdeburg had already been confiscated

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:24.579
and released several times.

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:32.920
And this may explain why the Macdeburg Bible doesn't have a typical publishes page listing

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.920
of who published it, who translated when and where it was printed.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.920
But on the bottom of one of the last pages, there is just one line in small letters

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.920
and it reads, printed, watched our Bible and Trek Society Macdeburg.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.920
Interestingly, on September 13th, 1934, the Ministry of the Interior of the German government

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.920
granted permission for the Macdeburg office to resume the printing and distribution of bubbles.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:12.289
However, everybody knew that the facilities could be shut down again, perhaps permanently at any time.

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:16.289
What really could be accomplished in the limited time they had?

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:22.289
The Macdeburg office informed Rutherford that they had possession of a new testament manuscript.

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:28.289
Ready for printing and additionally a translation of the old testament was nearly complete.

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:38.289
In October 1934, Rutherford approved the printing of 100,000 copies, but time was running out.

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:43.289
For the Rutherford received the following letter dated August 6, 1935,

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:49.289
and it says, in the afternoon of July 10th, a number of officials of the secret police

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:55.289
of Berlin and Macdeburg appeared and sealed the factory, rooms and offices at Macdeburg.

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:59.289
Close all factory rooms, attach the property and money of the society.

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:04.289
Several thousand bubbles were just being bound and the rest is printed.

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:09.289
Sadly, only a small number of those bubbles actually made it out of the printer.

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:18.289
In November 2017, after a careful surge, we were able to obtain three copies of the Macdeburg Bible.

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:28.289
Little did we know what a treasured place in our organization's history of Bible translation and printing this Bible deserves.

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:36.289
It's not a mere compilation of existing translations, but a fresh, a unique translation of the Bible.

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:44.289
Jehovah's name is used extensively in the text of the Hebrew scriptures, as well as in footnotes of the Christian Greek scriptures.

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:51.289
The Macdeburg Bible was also cited in German language editions of the Watchtower.

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:59.289
And nearly a century later, the text can still be easily understood by the German reader.

00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:03.289
This Bible translation truly has a remarkable story.

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:09.289
Its print run was small by normal Bible printing standards and its distribution was even smaller.

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:15.289
And although it was produced in record time and under highly dangerous circumstances,

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:19.290
it story lay forgotten for decades until it was rediscovered.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:30.290
The Macdeburg Bible is the first non-bible to be translated and published by Jehovah's Witnesses, predating the new world translation of the Holy Scriptures.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:38.290
It was able to survive in a time of Nazi government opposition and is now part of our Bible museum at Warwick.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:46.290
This Bible truly is a testimony to the words we find in Isaiah 40 verse 8.

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.290
But Jehovah's Word bliped evictly.
