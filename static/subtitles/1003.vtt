WEBVTT

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.800
This convention program will be translated into more than 450 languages.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.800
This work is supported by branch offices around the globe.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:34.799
Each of us has an opportunity to show appreciation for the spiritual blessings we have received in our own language.

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:41.799
One way we can do this is by making voluntary gifts in accord with our circumstances.

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:47.799
Donations can be made online at donate.jw.org.

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:54.939
Whether young or old, we face tests of faith.

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:58.939
Changing circumstances can bring new challenges.

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:02.939
How can we meet each test with unwavering faith?

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:11.939
We invite you to put yourself in the scene as you watch the drama, Daniel, a lifetime of faith, Part 1.

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:44.150
My King.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.150
General.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.150
We starve them out, but your Hayek can still live.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:54.939
Negotiations don't concern your general when competence does.

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:56.939
Finish it!

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.939
You'll not find me as forgiving as the gods.

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:18.770
Yes, my King.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:25.770
The whole of army says, because you did not obey my words, all this land will be reduced to ruins.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.770
And this land and its inhabitants will have to serve the King of Babylon for 70 years.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:44.500
Daniel, where have you been? It's on the sundown.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.500
Sorry, Jeremiah was speaking today and I stopped by the temple on the way home.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.500
Well, we're almost ready.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:09.280
We're at the temple again today.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.280
I was.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.280
To gaze upon the pleasantness of Jehovah.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.280
And to look with appreciation upon his temple.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.310
I have something for you.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:37.610
So you can always have Jehovah's words with you.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:46.710
Thank you, Papa.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.310
What's wrong? What's going to happen to us?

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:59.990
What always happens to Jehovah's faithful servants?

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.990
Have no fear.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:07.770
Jehovah is our shield.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:37.699
It's ready.

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:39.699
Let's sing.

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:42.699
Son, pick a song.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.699
Jehovah is my light in my salvation.

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.699
You always choose heaven.

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:52.439
Who's him?

00:04:52.439 --> 00:05:54.079
I know Zark.

00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:55.079
Sure.

00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:56.079
And who will you be?

00:05:56.079 --> 00:06:29.110
You're things.

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.110
We have to go.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:37.680
We don't live here anymore.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.389
Who's him?

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:43.389
Grab our bags.

00:06:43.389 --> 00:09:24.100
What's going on?

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.100
Daniel.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.100
Of the tribe of Judah.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:37.059
You will receive training in the house of the great king, Nebuchadnezzar.

00:09:37.059 --> 00:09:39.059
But this is my family.

00:09:39.059 --> 00:09:42.059
Prince's and Noble's belonging the pal.

00:09:42.059 --> 00:09:46.100
He's not a prince.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.100
He's just a boy.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:54.340
Please.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.340
I will go.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:56.340
If it's a servant, you see.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.340
No.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.340
I'm taking the boy.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:59.340
Daniel.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.340
Wait.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:07.659
Can we say goodbye?

00:10:07.659 --> 00:10:08.659
Make it quick.

00:10:08.659 --> 00:10:27.820
He's strong, my son.

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.820
Jehovah is with you.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:11:39.879
Michelle.

00:11:39.879 --> 00:11:40.879
Have you seen anyone else?

00:11:40.879 --> 00:11:42.879
You didn't think we'd let you come here alone, did you?

00:11:42.879 --> 00:11:44.879
That's right.

00:11:44.879 --> 00:11:45.879
Get an eye out.

00:11:45.879 --> 00:11:48.159
Is this kids' lawn on the high side?

00:11:48.159 --> 00:11:49.159
Nice to meet you.

00:11:49.159 --> 00:11:59.730
Have you seen Joseph?

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:00.730
Have you heard of his house?

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:02.730
No, like Joseph in the dungeon.

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:04.730
Doesn't seem so bad to me.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:09.730
Quick.

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:17.480
Kisla.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:13:31.539
Move.

00:13:31.539 --> 00:13:34.539
You have been chosen because you were wise.

00:13:34.539 --> 00:13:39.289
But you are lacking.

00:13:39.289 --> 00:13:43.210
You will learn our writing.

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:45.210
And our language.

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:50.830
You will be given new names.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:57.669
And at the end of three years,

00:13:57.669 --> 00:14:01.669
you will serve the great king, Nebuchadnezzar.

00:14:01.669 --> 00:14:08.580
Today, you are foreigners.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:15.179
Tomorrow?

00:14:15.179 --> 00:14:17.179
The God's willing.

00:14:17.179 --> 00:14:19.179
Avalonians.

00:14:19.179 --> 00:15:01.860
Meshach.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.860
You look like a Meshach.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:09.279
Our new names sound like their gods.

00:15:09.279 --> 00:15:11.279
New names, new language.

00:15:11.279 --> 00:15:13.279
Soon they want us to worship their gods.

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:15.279
Calm down.

00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:17.279
My father had idols.

00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:19.279
And he worshiped Jehovah.

00:15:19.279 --> 00:15:22.279
Did you see the same city I did?

00:15:22.279 --> 00:15:25.279
It's the center of the world.

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:27.279
We'll even eat from the king's table.

00:15:27.279 --> 00:15:31.460
But do Babylonians eat?

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:40.799
His servants are given only the best.

00:15:40.799 --> 00:16:02.259
Is there a problem?

00:16:02.259 --> 00:16:06.259
Our God doesn't allow us to eat such foods.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:13.090
Do you feel your God?

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.090
I do.

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:21.090
Well, I am afraid of my Lord the King.

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:25.850
Who has assigned your food and drink?

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:29.850
He insists on these selections

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:35.059
to maintain your strength and vitality.

00:16:35.059 --> 00:16:39.059
What if he should see you looking worse than appearance

00:16:39.059 --> 00:16:42.429
than the other youths?

00:16:42.429 --> 00:16:48.659
Who would make me guilty before the king?

00:16:48.659 --> 00:16:51.899
I must obey the king.

00:16:51.899 --> 00:16:57.070
So much to you.

00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:03.649
All of you.

00:17:03.649 --> 00:17:05.650
When dinner is served, I expect you to be hungry.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:33.250
You don't speak for us.

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:35.250
You're right.

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:37.250
You can make your own choice.

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.250
Didn't you hear him?

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:41.250
We don't have a choice.

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:45.039
He's a new land with new laws.

00:17:45.039 --> 00:17:48.039
So what if some of the food is unblood?

00:17:48.039 --> 00:17:50.039
It's just food.

00:17:50.039 --> 00:17:52.039
But Jehovah commanded us not to eat blood.

00:17:52.039 --> 00:17:56.309
It's your interpretation.

00:17:56.309 --> 00:17:58.309
You must not eat any blood at all.

00:17:58.309 --> 00:18:00.309
What's too interpret in that?

00:18:00.309 --> 00:18:03.309
Maybe we should all take a moment and pray.

00:18:03.309 --> 00:18:05.309
Pray.

00:18:05.309 --> 00:18:06.309
Here.

00:18:06.309 --> 00:18:09.819
What's the point?

00:18:09.819 --> 00:18:12.819
Jehovah's in Israel.

00:18:12.819 --> 00:18:14.819
We're in Babylon now.

00:18:14.819 --> 00:18:17.819
Don't you believe Jehovah's here too?

00:18:17.819 --> 00:18:24.980
Jehovah said that we're his witnesses.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.980
What will people say about Jehovah

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.980
if we give in and break his laws?

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:55.890
Your meal is ready.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:56.890
Did you hear me?

00:18:56.890 --> 00:19:01.640
Thank you.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:05.640
But if we eat those foods, we'll disobey our God.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.640
Is it a starve?

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:11.210
No, of course not.

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:16.210
He forbids us from eating blood and food that he calls unclean.

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:20.210
Please, test your servants for ten days.

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:23.210
And let us be given some vegetables to eat

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:25.210
and water to drink.

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:27.210
Vegetables.

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:35.460
Just give us ten days.

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.460
And then deal with your servants according to what you see.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:22:19.140
Ten days.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:40.859
Ashman has this something to do.

00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:42.859
Oh Lord, he's young men or woman.

00:22:42.859 --> 00:22:43.859
I know who they are.

00:22:56.910 --> 00:23:07.390
We've been watching you.

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:11.180
You don't bow to our idols.

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:16.680
You pray only to your God

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:20.680
and you are not eating our foods.

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.680
They insisted that their God would not eat them.

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:30.970
And somehow, you look healthier than the others.

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:39.700
Continue giving them the diet they've requested.

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:49.180
And built a chasar?

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:53.039
Your future is bright.

00:23:53.039 --> 00:23:54.039
Don't waste it.

00:23:54.039 --> 00:24:26.569
Bring in the next group.

00:24:26.569 --> 00:24:29.569
A little ration would be 15 kuru,

00:24:29.569 --> 00:24:31.569
2 Payna and 5 Suta.

00:24:31.569 --> 00:24:39.039
Correct.

00:24:39.039 --> 00:24:41.039
How much interest may emerge in charge on money

00:24:41.039 --> 00:24:46.619
and green?

00:24:46.619 --> 00:24:49.619
It would be 40% by Lord.

00:24:49.619 --> 00:24:51.619
40%?

00:24:51.619 --> 00:24:54.619
Have you learned going to be a thief in the past three years?

00:24:54.619 --> 00:24:58.130
And you, Mishak?

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:01.130
The rate is 20%.

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:02.130
Very good.

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:10.160
Which star of Enlil is brightest in the Urgola constellation?

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:24.930
Do you know?

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:26.930
It is the Lugow star.

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:29.930
Impressive.

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:31.930
There is a tower that is high.

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:34.930
But nonetheless has no shade.

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:35.930
What is it?

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:43.369
Your ziggurat?

00:25:43.369 --> 00:25:44.369
Hopeless.

00:25:44.369 --> 00:25:53.740
You can solve the riddle?

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:56.740
It is sunlight, my Lord.

00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:58.740
Correct.

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:03.740
My wisemen teach that the gods are responsible for everything.

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:08.740
If that's so, why do the good suffer

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:11.740
and the evil prosper?

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:24.720
As you say, O King,

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.720
the wise do not always have the food.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.720
Nor do the intelligent always have the riches.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:34.720
Nor do those with knowledge always have success

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:43.500
because time and unexpected events overtake them all.

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.500
Who wrote those words?

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:48.259
Solomon.

00:26:48.259 --> 00:26:50.259
Fame for his wisdom.

00:26:50.259 --> 00:26:54.259
But its source was his God,

00:26:55.259 --> 00:27:01.609
our God, Jehovah.

00:27:01.609 --> 00:27:02.609
Take them away.

00:27:05.779 --> 00:27:06.779
You went to your return.

00:27:06.779 --> 00:27:07.779
You won't.

00:27:07.779 --> 00:27:11.150
Go back to your families.

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:16.650
Prove them worth this.

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:18.650
Built the sheds are no.

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:22.759
Not the four of you.

00:27:22.759 --> 00:27:31.990
We have more to discuss.

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:33.990
I did not know you're gone.

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:35.990
But you've proven to be ten times better than any priest

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:37.990
or conjurer I've met.

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:43.349
Ashpinaz will arrange for you to serve in the palace

00:27:43.349 --> 00:27:46.890
with my wisemen.

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:48.890
Maybe your gifts are wasted in Jerusalem.

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:50.890
But here they'll be put to use.

00:27:50.890 --> 00:28:14.559
The victory in Jerusalem is complete.

00:28:14.559 --> 00:28:18.970
Our forces are not preparing to be seized higher.

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:22.630
They should remember what happened to Zedakaya.

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:27.160
The gods are with us.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:44.750
Jira, what is it?

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:46.750
It's about Jerusalem.

00:28:46.750 --> 00:29:13.460
Where are you going?

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:14.460
To see my family.

00:29:14.460 --> 00:30:29.220
It's wrong.

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:32.809
It's Jerusalem.

00:30:32.809 --> 00:30:40.769
They tore down the walls.

00:30:40.769 --> 00:30:42.769
They torched its towers.

00:30:42.769 --> 00:30:54.460
Many died.

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:59.509
And they burned down Jehovah's house.

00:30:59.509 --> 00:31:08.779
I didn't know people listened.

00:31:08.779 --> 00:31:13.019
Did they think Jehovah couldn't see what they were doing?

00:31:13.019 --> 00:31:16.019
As long as our temple existed,

00:31:16.019 --> 00:31:18.019
our people had hope.

00:31:18.019 --> 00:31:26.559
As long as Jehovah exists,

00:31:26.559 --> 00:31:28.559
we have hope.

00:31:28.559 --> 00:31:33.099
But he's rejected us.

00:31:33.099 --> 00:31:36.099
Because of our unrighteousness.

00:31:36.099 --> 00:31:42.180
He hasn't not everyone.

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:45.180
Jehovah told Ezekiel

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:48.180
that in his eyes,

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:50.180
you,

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:52.180
or his righteous,

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:54.180
his Noah,

00:31:54.180 --> 00:32:00.849
and Job,

00:32:00.849 --> 00:32:01.849
he said that.

00:32:01.849 --> 00:32:05.089
He did.

00:32:05.089 --> 00:32:16.119
If Jehovah cares so much,

00:32:16.119 --> 00:32:23.180
then why are we an exile?

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:26.680
Why can't we go home?

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.680
Why can't we be together?

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.680
You are home, son.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:54.480
Don't have all the answers.

00:32:54.480 --> 00:33:00.009
Stay close to Jehovah.

00:33:00.009 --> 00:33:02.009
You will be blessed.

00:33:02.009 --> 00:33:58.400
I've had a dream.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:03.980
And I'm agitated.

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:04.980
And I know what I dreamed.

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:05.980
Okay.

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:06.980
May you live on forever.

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:08.980
Relate the dream to your service.

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:09.980
We will tell the interpretation.

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:10.980
No.

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:12.980
If you don't make the dream known to me,

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:14.980
along with the interpretation,

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:16.980
you'll be dismembered.

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:19.980
And your houses will be turned to public latrines.

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:23.980
But if you do tell me the dream,

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:25.980
and the interpretation,

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:27.980
you'll receive gifts

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:30.980
and a reward and great honor.

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:52.219
You've agreed to tell me something false

00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:55.219
and deceitful to a situation changes.

00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:56.219
This deceitful?

00:34:56.219 --> 00:35:00.460
This deceitful!

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:04.460
There is not a man on earth who can do with the King demands.

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:06.460
What the King is asking is difficult.

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:09.460
No one exists and tell this to the King except...

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:10.460
except the gods.

00:35:22.909 --> 00:35:23.909
Ariac?

00:35:23.909 --> 00:35:40.659
Seize them.

00:35:40.659 --> 00:35:41.659
Jira.

00:35:41.659 --> 00:35:42.659
You're in danger.

00:35:42.659 --> 00:35:43.659
Why? What happened?

00:35:43.659 --> 00:35:44.659
I didn't hear anything.

00:35:44.659 --> 00:35:46.659
But the Weisman angered the King.

00:35:46.659 --> 00:35:48.659
Everyone's to be executed by dawn.

00:35:48.659 --> 00:35:51.659
Bring Hanania, Michelle, and Ezoraya here.

00:35:51.659 --> 00:35:57.730
I'll try to learn more.

00:35:57.730 --> 00:35:58.730
Yes.

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:00.730
Teldian, Egyptian, Jewish.

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:06.789
All the Weisman.

00:36:06.789 --> 00:36:07.789
Ariac.

00:36:07.789 --> 00:36:08.789
Of the Shazar.

00:36:08.789 --> 00:36:10.789
You shouldn't be here.

00:36:10.789 --> 00:36:13.789
Why is there such a harsh water from the King?

00:36:13.789 --> 00:36:15.789
He had a dream.

00:36:15.789 --> 00:36:18.789
And no one can tell him what it is.

00:36:18.789 --> 00:36:20.789
Flea now.

00:36:20.789 --> 00:36:23.789
If you speak before dawn, you might survive.

00:36:23.789 --> 00:37:19.329
Without wisdom!

00:37:19.329 --> 00:37:21.329
What are you doing here?

00:37:21.329 --> 00:37:23.329
I need to speak with the King.

00:37:23.329 --> 00:37:24.329
You need to go.

00:37:24.329 --> 00:37:26.329
Please let me speak with him.

00:37:26.329 --> 00:37:32.750
My Lord, this is Belta Shazar.

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:37.019
Okay.

00:37:37.019 --> 00:37:41.019
Interpretations belong to my God, Jehovah.

00:37:41.019 --> 00:37:46.199
He knows your dream and what it means.

00:37:46.199 --> 00:37:48.199
Where is your God? Where?

00:37:48.199 --> 00:37:52.380
I believe that he...

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:56.380
I know that he will reveal it to me.

00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:04.869
Please, give me time.

00:38:04.869 --> 00:38:06.869
We have until morning.

00:38:06.869 --> 00:38:08.869
To do what?

00:38:08.869 --> 00:38:10.869
To reveal the dream to the King.

00:38:10.869 --> 00:38:20.590
How much of the dream is Jehovah revealed to you?

00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:25.280
Well, nothing yet.

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:30.280
But Jehovah revealed that he would interpret it.

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.849
Right?

00:38:32.849 --> 00:38:33.849
Not exactly.

00:38:33.849 --> 00:38:36.849
Daniel, how do you know this is even going to happen?

00:38:36.849 --> 00:38:41.150
Well, I can't be sure.

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:44.150
You'd better be sure.

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:46.150
His name is at stake.

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:49.150
If he reveals the dream, it proves that he's the true God.

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:50.150
If?

00:38:50.150 --> 00:39:06.550
What can we do to help?

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:07.550
Pray.

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:09.550
Pray that Jehovah have mercy on us.

00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:22.980
Oh, Jehovah.

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:27.840
Surely you didn't bring us here just to die.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:32.239
What will people say?

00:39:32.239 --> 00:39:35.239
We told them that you are the God of the heavens,

00:39:35.239 --> 00:39:39.239
the only God who can reveal secrets.

00:39:39.239 --> 00:39:43.780
Please, vindicate yourself.

00:39:43.780 --> 00:40:47.630
Jira!

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:49.630
I found a man from the axiles of Judah

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:52.630
who could make no interpretation to the King.

00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:53.630
I know who he is.

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:58.710
Can you really make known to me the dream that I saw?

00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:13.320
And his interpretation.

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:16.320
There is a God in the heavens who is a revealer of secrets.

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:21.139
And he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar

00:41:21.139 --> 00:41:24.139
what is to happen in the final part of the days.

00:41:24.139 --> 00:41:30.059
This is your dream.

00:41:30.059 --> 00:41:51.030
You saw an immense image

00:41:51.030 --> 00:42:03.369
of standing in front of you.

00:42:03.369 --> 00:42:08.769
You yourself are the head of gold

00:42:08.769 --> 00:42:13.179
after you another kingdom will rise

00:42:13.179 --> 00:42:16.179
inferior to you.

00:42:16.179 --> 00:42:18.179
Then another kingdom,

00:42:18.179 --> 00:42:20.179
a third one of copper

00:42:20.179 --> 00:42:23.179
that will rule over the whole earth.

00:42:24.179 --> 00:42:26.179
As for the fourth kingdom,

00:42:26.179 --> 00:42:28.179
it will be strong like iron.

00:42:28.179 --> 00:42:33.260
The kingdom will be divided

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:35.260
and as the toes of the feet

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:38.260
were partly of iron and partly of clay,

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:41.260
so the kingdom will be partly strong

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:44.260
and partly fragile.

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:46.260
In the days of those kings,

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:50.260
the God of heaven will set up a kingdom

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:53.260
that will never be destroyed.

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:55.260
And this kingdom will not be passed

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:57.260
onto any other people

00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:13.699
and put an end to all these kingdoms.

00:43:13.699 --> 00:43:59.119
The dream is true

00:43:59.119 --> 00:44:03.590
and its interpretation is trustworthy.

00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:44.159
Quick, bring the fine robe

00:44:44.159 --> 00:44:47.159
and a necklace of gold

00:44:47.159 --> 00:45:12.389
earned an instance before him.

00:45:12.389 --> 00:45:15.389
Truly your God is a God of gods

00:45:15.389 --> 00:45:18.389
and a Lord of kings

00:45:18.389 --> 00:45:21.389
and a revealer of secrets.

00:45:21.389 --> 00:45:23.389
May your God be honored

00:45:23.389 --> 00:45:27.659
by the honor I give you.

00:45:27.659 --> 00:45:28.659
You are now ruler

00:45:28.659 --> 00:45:36.559
over all the province of Babylon.

00:45:36.559 --> 00:45:37.559
O King,

00:45:37.559 --> 00:45:41.559
these servants also worship the God in the heavens.

00:45:41.559 --> 00:45:43.559
May they too be appointed

00:45:43.559 --> 00:45:45.559
to administer the province.

00:45:45.559 --> 00:45:51.780
Make the necessary arrangements.

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:56.570
You have proven far superior

00:45:56.570 --> 00:46:01.360
and they so-called wise men.

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:05.250
I now appoint you

00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:14.030
their chief prefect.

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:16.030
Did you hear it in every caneser?

00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:17.030
When he said,

00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:19.030
your God is a God of gods

00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:21.030
and a Lord of kings,

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:24.030
Jehovah entered your prayer.

00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:26.030
Jehovah answered our prayers.

00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:43.460
What's going to happen next?

00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:46.699
Can we go back to Jerusalem?

00:46:46.699 --> 00:46:51.360
I don't know what happens next,

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:54.360
but as long as we stay close to Jehovah,

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:56.360
you will always be with us

00:46:56.360 --> 00:47:00.980
as long as we have faith in Him.

00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:08.230
There's nothing in the stars

00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:10.230
about kingdom's crushing kingdoms.

00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:18.090
Of course not.

00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:20.090
It's a trick.

00:47:20.090 --> 00:47:22.090
But how did he know the dream?

00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:24.780
I'm a root you wouldn't

00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:27.780
put a message from the gods.

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:29.780
I have examined a sheep's liver.

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:31.780
Your future is bright.

00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:32.780
Stars of Shabbatue,

00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:33.780
the giant,

00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:34.780
speak only of your grandeur.

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:36.780
And I'm the head of gold.

00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:37.780
Jehovah said so.

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:39.780
Your dream revealed many good things.

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:40.780
But...

00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:42.780
You spelled the Shazzar?

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:43.780
He's a Jew.

00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:45.780
It's a clever Jew to be sure,

00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:48.780
he couldn't interpret dreams before he came to Babylon.

00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:51.780
He first had to be educated here,

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:53.780
and given a Babylonian name,

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:59.130
a name that honors our great God, Bell.

00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:01.130
Bell used this young captive

00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:03.130
to reveal great things to you.

00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:07.690
Bell,

00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:09.690
not Jehovah who you defeated in Jerusalem.

00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:37.539
So the tree is my enemies.

00:48:37.539 --> 00:48:42.789
Who is it after the seven times Passover?

00:48:42.789 --> 00:48:49.130
Then it is you again, a great king.

00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:55.380
You are fools.

00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:57.380
At last,

00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:59.380
Belta Shazzar,

00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:02.380
Chief of the Magic Practicing Priests,

00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:04.380
all of the otherwise men are unable

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:06.380
to make the interpretation known to me.

00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:16.829
But you're able to do so.

00:49:16.829 --> 00:49:18.829
Explain to me the visions I've seen in my dreams.

00:49:18.829 --> 00:49:32.159
What did you dream?

00:49:32.159 --> 00:49:36.159
I saw a tree in the midst of the earth,

00:49:36.159 --> 00:49:38.159
and it's height.

00:49:38.159 --> 00:49:40.159
It was enormous.

00:49:40.159 --> 00:49:42.159
And the tree grew.

00:49:42.159 --> 00:49:44.159
And it became strong.

00:49:44.159 --> 00:49:46.159
And it's top.

00:49:46.159 --> 00:49:48.159
And it's top.

00:49:48.159 --> 00:49:58.699
And it's a hand.

00:49:58.699 --> 00:50:11.300
Iron, and of copper.

00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:38.510
So who's the tree?

00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:41.510
In the dream apply to those hating you,

00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:44.510
and its interpretation to your enemies.

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:46.510
The tree that you saw.

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:49.510
That grew great and became strong,

00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:51.510
and its top reached the heavens,

00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:53.510
and was visible to all the earth.

00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:55.510
Which had beautiful foliage,

00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:57.510
abundant fruit,

00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:59.510
and food for all.

00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:01.510
Beneath which the beasts of the field would dwell,

00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:03.510
and on whose branches,

00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:07.369
the birds of the heavens would reside.

00:51:07.369 --> 00:51:09.369
It is you,

00:51:09.369 --> 00:51:12.869
O King,

00:51:12.869 --> 00:51:14.869
and the King saw a watcher,

00:51:14.869 --> 00:51:16.869
a holy one,

00:51:16.869 --> 00:51:18.869
coming down from the heavens,

00:51:18.869 --> 00:51:20.869
who was saying,

00:51:21.869 --> 00:51:44.650
But leave the stump with its roots in the ground,

00:51:44.650 --> 00:51:48.650
with a banding of iron and of copper,

00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:50.650
and let the dew of the heavens make it wet,

00:51:50.650 --> 00:51:55.059
to portion thee with the beasts of the field,

00:51:55.059 --> 00:52:00.550
until seven times pass over it.

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:02.550
This is the interpretation, O King.

00:52:02.550 --> 00:52:05.550
It is the decree of the most high.

00:52:05.550 --> 00:52:08.550
You will be driven away from among men,

00:52:08.550 --> 00:52:12.550
and your dwelling will be with the beasts of the field.

00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:15.550
And you will be given vegetation to eat,

00:52:15.550 --> 00:52:17.550
just like bowls,

00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:20.550
and you will become wet with the dew of the heavens.

00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:23.550
And seven times will pass over you,

00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:25.550
until you know,

00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:29.550
that the most high is ruler in the kingdom of mankind,

00:52:29.550 --> 00:52:32.550
and that he grants it to whomever he wants.

00:52:32.550 --> 00:52:38.570
But because they said to leave the stump of the tree with its roots,

00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:40.570
your kingdom will be yours again.

00:52:41.570 --> 00:52:43.570
After you come to know,

00:52:43.570 --> 00:52:49.059
that the heavens are ruling,

00:52:49.059 --> 00:52:51.059
turn away from your sins,

00:52:51.059 --> 00:52:53.059
by doing what is right,

00:52:53.059 --> 00:52:56.059
and from your iniquity by showing mercy to the poor,

00:52:56.059 --> 00:53:16.469
it may be that your prosperity will be extended.

00:53:16.469 --> 00:53:18.469
Does Belta Shazzar know in this world?

00:53:18.469 --> 00:53:22.809
No.

00:53:22.809 --> 00:53:24.809
But your wise men,

00:53:24.809 --> 00:53:27.809
doubt that his interpretation can be trusted.

00:53:27.809 --> 00:53:30.809
Look at the facts.

00:53:30.809 --> 00:53:35.809
Egypt's gods told the Egyptians

00:53:35.809 --> 00:53:38.809
that they would defeat us,

00:53:38.809 --> 00:53:40.809
yet you destroyed them.

00:53:40.809 --> 00:53:51.860
So why should the god of the Jews be given any more credit?

00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:55.980
Look at what you've done.

00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:57.980
The gods are with you.

00:53:57.980 --> 00:54:02.980
You have made Babylon the greatest kingdom on earth.

00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:09.989
Belta Shazzar wants you to grovel like a slave.

00:54:09.989 --> 00:54:11.989
You.

00:54:11.989 --> 00:54:14.989
A strong king means a strong king.

00:54:14.989 --> 00:54:19.099
Let's continue with our discussion.

00:54:19.099 --> 00:54:20.099
The stars of Enville,

00:54:20.099 --> 00:54:22.099
now the Luke out star,

00:54:22.099 --> 00:54:25.099
is the brightest star in the Ergola constellation.

00:54:25.099 --> 00:54:27.099
Stars are reliable.

00:54:27.099 --> 00:54:31.860
Unlike the gods of defeated nations,

00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:33.860
go back to Jews.

00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:35.860
Oh, you could,

00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:54.539
if there was anything left of it.

00:54:54.539 --> 00:54:57.539
Jehovah revealed anything new.

00:54:57.539 --> 00:55:00.539
It's been ten months.

00:55:00.539 --> 00:55:02.539
Still no sign of this supposed insanity.

00:55:02.539 --> 00:55:04.539
I trust my god.

00:55:04.539 --> 00:55:06.539
Yes, as we do,

00:55:06.539 --> 00:55:08.539
when we read the stars.

00:55:08.539 --> 00:55:11.539
But we still shape the message.

00:55:11.539 --> 00:55:14.539
You will be held responsible for the words.

00:55:14.539 --> 00:55:21.659
And when a wise man speaks lies.

00:55:21.659 --> 00:55:23.659
I spoke only what Jehovah revealed.

00:55:23.659 --> 00:55:25.659
Have you forgotten?

00:55:25.659 --> 00:55:29.659
What happened when some couldn't interpret the dream image?

00:55:29.659 --> 00:55:30.659
A death sentence followed.

00:55:30.659 --> 00:55:33.659
And that was a flattering interpretation.

00:55:33.659 --> 00:55:36.659
That the king was ahead of gold.

00:55:36.659 --> 00:55:40.659
This time, you said he'll go mad.

00:55:40.659 --> 00:55:43.659
And nothing has happened.

00:55:43.659 --> 00:55:45.659
It will happen.

00:55:45.659 --> 00:55:48.659
Maybe. Maybe not.

00:55:48.659 --> 00:55:51.659
But your words are against the king.

00:55:51.659 --> 00:55:53.659
It's treason.

00:55:53.659 --> 00:56:21.750
And no one can protect you from that.

00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:23.750
Ten months.

00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:28.059
Nothing has happened.

00:56:28.059 --> 00:56:31.059
But your words are against the king.

00:56:31.059 --> 00:56:35.059
Still no sign of this supposed insanity.

00:56:35.059 --> 00:56:38.730
It's treason.

00:56:38.730 --> 00:57:24.179
And no one can protect you from that.

00:57:24.179 --> 00:57:25.179
Always words with you.

00:57:25.179 --> 00:57:33.739
Instruct me in your way,

00:57:33.739 --> 00:57:35.739
Oh, Jehovah.

00:57:35.739 --> 00:57:38.739
Do not hand me over to my adversaries.

00:57:38.739 --> 00:57:41.739
For false witnesses have risen up against me.

00:57:41.739 --> 00:57:46.280
And they threaten me with violence.

00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:50.280
Where would I be if I did not have faith?

00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:54.280
That I would see Jehovah's goodness in the land of the living?

00:57:54.280 --> 00:58:00.139
Please, test your servants for ten days.

00:58:00.139 --> 00:58:05.139
Somehow, you look healthier than the others.

00:58:05.139 --> 00:58:09.380
Continue giving them the diet they've requested.

00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:11.380
I did not know your God.

00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:15.380
But you've proven ten times better than any priest or conjurer I've met.

00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:18.789
He had a dream.

00:58:18.789 --> 00:58:20.789
And no one can tell him what it is.

00:58:20.789 --> 00:58:38.150
Jehovah, answer, Jehovah.

00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:41.150
Hope in Jehovah.

00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:44.150
The courageous and strong of heart.

00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:45.150
Yes.

00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:47.150
Hope in Jehovah.

00:58:47.150 --> 00:59:08.260
Persecify us to build.

00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:09.260
To the gods.

00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:15.099
To the gods.

00:59:15.099 --> 00:59:17.099
This city.

00:59:17.099 --> 00:59:19.099
It's the jewel of the world.

00:59:19.099 --> 00:59:20.099
The Ishtar Gate.

00:59:20.099 --> 00:59:21.099
The gardens.

00:59:21.099 --> 00:59:22.099
The Zigarots.

00:59:22.099 --> 00:59:23.099
So high.

00:59:23.099 --> 00:59:26.099
It reaches the gods themselves.

00:59:26.099 --> 00:59:30.980
No one would question that.

00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:33.980
It's odd that only twelve months ago, one of your servants,

00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:35.980
dared to suggest that you go and say...

00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:37.980
Is this not Babylon the Great?

00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:41.980
That I myself have built for the royal house.

00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:45.739
With my own strength and might.

00:59:45.739 --> 00:59:48.739
And for the glory of my majesty.

00:59:48.739 --> 00:59:52.909
To you, it is being said.

00:59:52.909 --> 00:59:54.909
Oh, King Nebuchadnezzar.

00:59:54.909 --> 00:59:57.909
The kingdom has gone away from you.

00:59:57.909 --> 01:00:00.909
And from mankind, you are being driven away.

01:00:00.909 --> 01:00:03.909
With the beasts of the field, your dwelling will be.

01:00:03.909 --> 01:00:06.909
And you will be given vegetation to eat.

01:00:06.909 --> 01:00:08.909
Just like bulls.

01:00:08.909 --> 01:00:11.909
And seven times will pass over you.

01:00:11.909 --> 01:00:13.909
Until you know.

01:00:13.909 --> 01:00:18.909
That the most high is ruler in the kingdom of mankind.

01:00:18.909 --> 01:00:22.909
And that he grants it to whoever he wants.

01:00:22.909 --> 01:01:00.679
Consistently.

01:01:00.679 --> 01:01:02.679
How can you claim Daniel to be a fraud?

01:01:02.679 --> 01:01:03.679
This was a trick.

01:01:03.679 --> 01:01:07.679
Daniel conspired against your father.

01:01:07.679 --> 01:01:08.679
A trick.

01:01:08.679 --> 01:01:10.679
Then how did he make it happen?

01:01:10.679 --> 01:01:16.010
Everything he has said has come true.

01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:18.010
Which is quite different from what he's written from you.

01:01:18.010 --> 01:02:12.869
My father was a brother.

01:02:12.869 --> 01:02:14.869
Who is this god in the heavens?

01:02:14.869 --> 01:02:15.869
Jehovah.

01:02:15.869 --> 01:02:45.460
What a thrilling drama.

01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:49.460
And there's much more to learn from the life of Daniel.

01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:54.460
We will enjoy part two during the final session of this convention.

01:02:54.460 --> 01:03:01.260
Like Daniel, we encounter some who oppose and misrepresent us.

01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:06.260
How can we prevent our faith from being undermined?

01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:12.260
Please pay close attention to brother David's explain to the governing body.

01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:17.260
As he delivers the talk, put up a hard fight for the faith.

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:28.719
Now those are the words of Jude, the half-brother of Jesus.

01:03:28.719 --> 01:03:32.719
And it's important to consider them in their context.

01:03:32.719 --> 01:03:33.719
So let's do that.

01:03:33.719 --> 01:03:35.719
Please turn to Jude, verse three.

01:03:35.719 --> 01:03:40.719
And then even Bibles open because we're going to consider another verse in Jude.

01:03:40.719 --> 01:03:44.719
And this will help us to get the point that Jude was making.

01:03:44.719 --> 01:03:53.429
Jude, verse three, he says beloved ones.

01:03:53.429 --> 01:03:58.429
Although I was making every effort to write you about the salvation we hold in common,

01:03:58.429 --> 01:04:07.429
I found it necessary to write you to urge you to put up a hard fight for the faith.

01:04:07.429 --> 01:04:13.429
Now Jude himself had been putting up a hard fight for the faith.

01:04:13.429 --> 01:04:20.429
Consider this, just three years earlier, his own fleshly brother James.

01:04:20.429 --> 01:04:27.429
His own fleshly brother James was stone to death at the order of high priest Ananias.

01:04:27.429 --> 01:04:30.429
That was an open attack on God's people.

01:04:30.429 --> 01:04:34.429
And it must have been very painful to Jude and to others.

01:04:34.429 --> 01:04:37.429
And here's something interesting.

01:04:37.429 --> 01:04:45.429
Jude is not warning his brothers about high priest Ananias or about persecution.

01:04:45.429 --> 01:04:48.429
He has something else in mind, a different type of attack.

01:04:48.429 --> 01:04:51.429
And this is a sneaky one. Let's look at verse four.

01:04:51.429 --> 01:04:54.429
And we'll see why he wrote his letter.

01:04:54.429 --> 01:04:56.429
Notice the very first words.

01:04:56.429 --> 01:05:02.429
My reason is, so this is what I have in mind when I'm writing you brothers.

01:05:02.429 --> 01:05:12.429
My reason is that certain men have slipped in among you who were long ago appointed to this judgment by the Scriptures.

01:05:13.429 --> 01:05:21.429
So Jude is talking about false brothers who are presenting a real danger to the congregations in some ways.

01:05:21.429 --> 01:05:25.429
A greater danger than outright persecution.

01:05:25.429 --> 01:05:29.429
And did you notice what Jude said about those false brothers?

01:05:29.429 --> 01:05:31.429
They had slipped in.

01:05:31.429 --> 01:05:33.429
They were sneaky.

01:05:33.429 --> 01:05:37.429
That was true back then and it's true today as we'll see.

01:05:37.429 --> 01:05:41.429
And brothers, this is a very serious matter that we're considering today.

01:05:41.429 --> 01:05:43.429
Think of this.

01:05:43.429 --> 01:05:49.429
Was the Christian congregation brought down by persecution in the second and third centuries?

01:05:49.429 --> 01:05:51.429
It wasn't.

01:05:51.429 --> 01:05:57.429
It was brought down by false brothers, apostate, teachings.

01:05:57.429 --> 01:06:00.429
And so the devil can use an outright attack.

01:06:00.429 --> 01:06:07.429
He can use persecution to try to better the structure of the Christian congregation.

01:06:07.429 --> 01:06:12.429
But sometimes he uses rot from within.

01:06:12.429 --> 01:06:15.429
A subtle means to attack us.

01:06:15.429 --> 01:06:18.429
But whatever method he uses, we have to fight.

01:06:18.429 --> 01:06:22.429
Our faith is involved and our faith is worth fighting for.

01:06:22.429 --> 01:06:24.429
It's a gift from Jehovah.

01:06:24.429 --> 01:06:25.429
We have to hold onto it.

01:06:25.429 --> 01:06:27.429
It's a product of his Holy Spirit.

01:06:27.429 --> 01:06:32.429
So we have to put up a hard fight for our faith.

01:06:32.429 --> 01:06:35.429
So in this talk, we're not going to discuss persecution.

01:06:35.429 --> 01:06:40.429
We're going to discuss two of the subtle means Satan uses to weaken our faith.

01:06:40.429 --> 01:06:47.429
Apostasy and negative reports about Jehovah's Witnesses in the media.

01:06:47.429 --> 01:06:50.429
So first, let's talk about apostasy.

01:06:50.429 --> 01:06:55.429
And we'll call it spiritual poison.

01:06:55.429 --> 01:06:57.429
Now think about poison.

01:06:57.429 --> 01:07:00.429
What's the best way to avoid being poisoned?

01:07:00.429 --> 01:07:05.429
Well, we have to recognize poison when we see it, and then avoid it.

01:07:05.429 --> 01:07:11.429
And the same principle applies to teachings that could destroy our faith.

01:07:11.429 --> 01:07:13.429
And that's not always easy.

01:07:13.429 --> 01:07:18.429
Now, not many of our brothers and sisters would deliberately get involved with apostates.

01:07:18.429 --> 01:07:21.429
But it could happen without realizing it.

01:07:21.429 --> 01:07:28.429
We receive letters at times from brothers and sisters who were troubled by something they saw on a web page.

01:07:28.429 --> 01:07:33.429
An accusation, a rumor about the society or about the organization.

01:07:33.429 --> 01:07:39.429
And the problem is they had no idea that apostates were behind it.

01:07:39.429 --> 01:07:45.429
It's tricky because the apostates don't advertise you are now on an apostate web page.

01:07:45.429 --> 01:07:51.429
They often pose as sincere witnesses who just have questions or concerns.

01:07:52.429 --> 01:08:00.429
And some who aren't really apostates can cause just as much trouble as the apostates do by their negative talk and criticism.

01:08:00.429 --> 01:08:03.429
Brothers, we need to be on the alert.

01:08:03.429 --> 01:08:05.429
This is serious.

01:08:05.429 --> 01:08:12.429
Suppose that out of curiosity, you get into a discussion forum with individuals who claim to meet Jehovah's Witnesses.

01:08:12.429 --> 01:08:15.429
Now maybe they are, maybe they are, you don't know.

01:08:15.429 --> 01:08:16.430
You've never met them.

01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:18.430
And someone starts asking questions.

01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:21.430
What did you think of last month's broadcast?

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:24.430
Did you really find it encouraging?

01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:28.430
Or do you think the brothers who write watched our articles are living in the real world?

01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:32.430
I wonder if they realize just how hard it is out here.

01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:36.430
And then a few others join in with their own negative comments.

01:08:36.430 --> 01:08:43.430
Now you don't know whether these individuals are apostates or just brothers and sisters who were in serious spiritual trouble.

01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:45.430
But does it matter?

01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:50.430
How does it make you feel when you leave the forum?

01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:52.430
Do you feel upbuilt?

01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:54.430
Determined to expand your ministry?

01:08:54.430 --> 01:09:03.430
More convinced than ever that Jehovah has an organization that you love and that you're delighted to be a part of you feel honored to be a part of that organization.

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:07.430
Or does the experience leave you sad?

01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:10.430
Uneasy, uncomfortable.

01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:17.779
Now someone might say, I need to get involved in that forum so I can help those people.

01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:19.779
They shouldn't be together.

01:09:19.779 --> 01:09:23.779
Even if they aren't apostates, they're not good for one another.

01:09:23.779 --> 01:09:33.779
Staying in that forum to help someone is like holding his hand while he drinks poison and then having some yourself so he doesn't have to drink alone.

01:09:33.779 --> 01:09:39.779
We need to follow the advice recorded at Romans chapter 16 and verse 17.

01:09:39.779 --> 01:09:47.779
Now think of this imaginary forum that we just described in the light of Romans chapter 16 and verse 17.

01:09:47.779 --> 01:09:52.779
Remember there's all kinds of negative top flying around in this forum.

01:09:52.779 --> 01:09:54.779
You don't know who's behind it.

01:09:54.779 --> 01:09:58.779
And here's what it says in Romans 16 verse 17.

01:09:59.779 --> 01:10:16.779
Now I urge you brothers to keep your eye on those who create divisions and causes for stumbling contrary to the teaching that you have learned and avoid them.

01:10:16.779 --> 01:10:19.779
Now think about that forum.

01:10:19.779 --> 01:10:22.779
Does it create divisions?

01:10:22.779 --> 01:10:23.779
Yes.

01:10:23.779 --> 01:10:25.779
Is it a cause for stumbling?

01:10:25.779 --> 01:10:26.779
Could be.

01:10:26.779 --> 01:10:29.779
Is it contrary to what we have learned?

01:10:29.779 --> 01:10:32.779
Do we even have to answer that question?

01:10:32.779 --> 01:10:37.779
Now whether it's intended or not, the effect will be to weaken our faith.

01:10:37.779 --> 01:10:38.779
So what do we do?

01:10:38.779 --> 01:10:41.779
What does Paul tell us to do here at the end of verse 17?

01:10:41.779 --> 01:10:43.779
He says, avoid them.

01:10:43.779 --> 01:10:52.279
No, I'd like to say a kind word to some who may be involved in discussion forums.

01:10:52.279 --> 01:10:56.279
You may like to use this medium to blow off steam, so to speak.

01:10:56.279 --> 01:11:04.279
Maybe there are little things in the congregation that are happening that you wonder about or decisions the elders have made that you wonder about.

01:11:04.279 --> 01:11:10.279
And so you get involved in the forum and you blow off steam and after that you feel better.

01:11:10.279 --> 01:11:13.279
But what about others in the forum?

01:11:13.279 --> 01:11:15.279
How do they feel?

01:11:15.279 --> 01:11:21.279
Wouldn't you feel awful if negative comments you made were responsible for someone leaving the truth?

01:11:21.279 --> 01:11:24.279
I know you wouldn't want that to happen.

01:11:24.279 --> 01:11:29.279
So please, please, be careful about what you say.

01:11:29.279 --> 01:11:35.279
Now another person might say, well, I can see where those warnings about apostates applied to so and so.

01:11:35.279 --> 01:11:37.279
He's weak, but don't worry about me.

01:11:37.279 --> 01:11:38.279
I'm spiritually strong.

01:11:38.279 --> 01:11:40.279
I can handle it.

01:11:40.279 --> 01:11:47.279
That's like a weightlifter, thinking that he can drink a vial of poison and it won't hurt him because he's so big and strong.

01:11:47.279 --> 01:11:56.279
We are not so strong, so spiritual, so intelligent, that we can't be affected by the poison of apostate ideas.

01:11:56.279 --> 01:12:04.659
Now, when might we feel pressured to read something that the apostates have written?

01:12:04.659 --> 01:12:06.659
Consider this scenario.

01:12:06.659 --> 01:12:13.659
The unbelieving husband of your Bible student sends his wife a link to an apostate web page and says,

01:12:13.659 --> 01:12:16.659
here, you better look at this and see what you're getting into.

01:12:16.659 --> 01:12:22.659
While your student is concerned, she wants you to take a look and tell her what you think.

01:12:22.659 --> 01:12:24.659
Well, that's not an option.

01:12:24.659 --> 01:12:27.659
Paul says, avoid them.

01:12:27.659 --> 01:12:34.659
That doesn't mean reading apostate literature or searching social media to see what they're saying about us.

01:12:34.659 --> 01:12:36.659
So what do you say to your student?

01:12:36.659 --> 01:12:40.189
You might say something like this.

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:44.189
I can imagine that this is very upsetting for you.

01:12:44.189 --> 01:12:47.189
And you certainly do need to know what you're getting into.

01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:49.189
I have a suggestion.

01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:51.189
We have nothing to hide.

01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:54.189
When you're at the meetings, listen carefully to what the brothers are saying.

01:12:54.189 --> 01:12:57.189
Watch how we interact with one another.

01:12:57.189 --> 01:13:00.189
That note of how the organization is financed.

01:13:00.189 --> 01:13:03.189
Get to know the elders, their wives.

01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:07.189
Introduce yourself to the circuit overseer and his wife when they come.

01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:09.189
Visit world headquarters of the branch.

01:13:09.189 --> 01:13:11.189
I'll come with you. I'll help you.

01:13:11.189 --> 01:13:14.189
And I want you to get really acquainted with the organization.

01:13:14.189 --> 01:13:22.189
And if you do, I'm sure you'll soon realize that what the people are saying about us isn't true.

01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:26.189
Well, maybe you can think of a better answer, but you get the idea.

01:13:26.189 --> 01:13:33.569
Just a few drops of poison in a drink are enough to cause serious harm.

01:13:33.569 --> 01:13:37.569
And apostate often makes a few truths with lies.

01:13:38.569 --> 01:13:42.569
Remember, LFS, one of Job's false comforters?

01:13:42.569 --> 01:13:44.569
Some of what he said was true.

01:13:44.569 --> 01:13:51.319
Let's turn to Job chapter 5 and verse 13.

01:13:51.319 --> 01:13:55.319
Job chapter 5, I'll give you a moment, and verse 13.

01:13:55.319 --> 01:14:01.689
See if what I read sounds familiar.

01:14:01.689 --> 01:14:05.689
He catches the wise in their own cunning,

01:14:05.689 --> 01:14:09.689
so that the plans of the should are thwarted.

01:14:09.689 --> 01:14:13.689
He catches the wise in their own coming, cunning.

01:14:13.689 --> 01:14:15.689
Does that sound familiar?

01:14:15.689 --> 01:14:16.689
Oh, yes.

01:14:16.689 --> 01:14:20.689
The Apostle Paul said the very same thing at first wrench in 319.

01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:23.689
In fact, in the marginal reference that we see in the little A,

01:14:23.689 --> 01:14:27.689
in the middle there, first Corinthians 319.

01:14:27.689 --> 01:14:32.689
Paul may even have been quoting LFS.

01:14:32.689 --> 01:14:34.689
So that was the truth.

01:14:35.689 --> 01:14:39.689
But how did Jehovah feel about LFS's argument overall?

01:14:39.689 --> 01:14:46.689
Let's turn to Job 42, verse 7, and see how Jehovah felt about it.

01:14:46.689 --> 01:14:49.689
Job 42, and verse 7.

01:14:49.689 --> 01:14:55.800
After Jehovah had spoken these words to Job,

01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:57.800
Jehovah said to Elephaz the team night,

01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:01.800
My anger burns against you and your true companions,

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:04.800
for you have not spoken the truth about me,

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:07.800
as my servant Job has.

01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:12.800
A few grains of truth were mixed in with falsehoods,

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:16.800
and at least some of what Elephaz said was inspired by the demons.

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.800
How do we know that?

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:21.800
He had mannered it, known as Job 4,

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:27.680
verses 15 through 17.

01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:29.680
I'll give you a moment, this is interesting.

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:32.680
Job 4, 15 to 17.

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:38.949
Elephaz says, a spirit passed over my face.

01:15:38.949 --> 01:15:41.949
The hair of my flesh bristled.

01:15:41.949 --> 01:15:43.949
It then stood still.

01:15:43.949 --> 01:15:46.949
But I did not recognize its appearance.

01:15:46.949 --> 01:15:48.949
Let's stop there for a second.

01:15:48.949 --> 01:15:51.949
I did not recognize its appearance,

01:15:51.949 --> 01:15:54.949
so he didn't know whom he was talking to,

01:15:54.949 --> 01:15:57.949
just like someone in a discussion forum may not know

01:15:57.949 --> 01:16:00.949
whom he is talking to.

01:16:00.949 --> 01:16:01.949
Let's continue.

01:16:01.949 --> 01:16:05.949
He says, a former was in front of my eyes.

01:16:05.949 --> 01:16:07.949
There was a calm,

01:16:07.949 --> 01:16:10.949
and then I heard a voice,

01:16:10.949 --> 01:16:13.949
kind of mortal man be more righteous than God,

01:16:13.949 --> 01:16:18.199
kind of man be cleaner than his own maker.

01:16:18.199 --> 01:16:20.199
Does it surprise you that a demon

01:16:20.199 --> 01:16:24.199
will get involved in the debate between Job and the false comforters?

01:16:24.199 --> 01:16:25.199
He shouldn't.

01:16:25.199 --> 01:16:27.199
This was no small debate.

01:16:27.199 --> 01:16:29.199
He was a big issue.

01:16:29.199 --> 01:16:33.199
Satan had challenged Jehovah in the presence of all the angels

01:16:33.199 --> 01:16:37.199
that no man would keep his integrity under test.

01:16:37.199 --> 01:16:41.199
That demon was using Elephaz to demoralize Job

01:16:41.199 --> 01:16:43.199
and weaken his faith.

01:16:43.199 --> 01:16:46.199
This was something that Job had to fight for,

01:16:46.199 --> 01:16:50.020
and Job fought back.

01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:54.020
Apostates are more active in some places than they are in others.

01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:57.020
So if there's a lot of apostate activity in your area,

01:16:57.020 --> 01:16:59.020
people in the territory may be listening,

01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:02.020
may challenge you when you meet them in the ministry.

01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:04.020
So how should you handle it?

01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:07.020
Don't try to argue with the apostates.

01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:10.020
Don't read their comments.

01:17:10.020 --> 01:17:13.020
Ask the elders or other experienced publishers for suggestions

01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:17.020
on how to answer the householders.

01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:22.020
Well, how poisonous are apostate teachings?

01:17:22.020 --> 01:17:26.020
Let's find out as we watch the following video.

01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:31.340
When I was in my 40s, I was divorced.

01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:34.340
I had three younger kids at home.

01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:36.340
I was working three jobs,

01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:40.340
and I had drifted away from the congregation.

01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:46.340
I had an acquaintance who was telling me that I was an occult

01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:52.340
and that I needed to look at some information that he had.

01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:55.340
When I was about 30 years old,

01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:58.340
a fellow employee saw that I was one of Jehovah's Witnesses

01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:00.340
and was trying to access JW.org.

01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:03.340
He told me about someone he knew in another country

01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:07.340
who could prove to me that Jehovah's Witnesses didn't have the truth.

01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:09.340
That made me curious.

01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:14.340
And little by little, I was persuaded to look in apostate material.

01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:17.340
So I was born and raised in the truth,

01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:21.340
chose to dedicate myself to Jehovah at the age of 16.

01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:27.340
But I began to associate with people who had either formerly been associated with the truth

01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:31.340
or were very loosely associated with Jehovah in his organization.

01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:36.340
And that's really where the apostasy began to take root.

01:18:36.340 --> 01:18:39.340
As I was reading this literature,

01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:42.340
I saw through it to an extent.

01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:44.340
But when you're drifting away,

01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:48.340
you're looking for a reason not to believe.

01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:54.340
I began to feed my mind with different philosophies, different ideas,

01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:57.340
even studied different religions.

01:18:57.340 --> 01:19:01.340
And you know, I told myself that I was doing that academically,

01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:06.340
but it started to influence the way that I thought and felt about things.

01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:09.340
Eventually, the elders reached out to me.

01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:12.340
I was very combative with those brothers.

01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:17.340
I even made the accusation that Noah's Ark was a fairy tale

01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:20.340
that that was part of mythology.

01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:26.340
Those apostate doubts that I was reading kept going deeper and deeper into my heart.

01:19:26.340 --> 01:19:28.340
I stopped reading the publications.

01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:30.340
I stopped going to the meetings.

01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:33.340
And as a result, my spiritual routine was dead.

01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:36.340
So I thought I'd try to find truth elsewhere.

01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:40.340
And I looked for something out there that was in accord with what I knew the Bible taught.

01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:44.579
But I couldn't find anything.

01:19:44.579 --> 01:19:47.579
Well, one Sunday morning, I rode by the Kingdom Hall,

01:19:47.579 --> 01:19:49.579
and I said to myself,

01:19:49.579 --> 01:19:52.579
oh, they're all in there waiting for Armageddon.

01:19:52.579 --> 01:19:56.579
Immediately, when I thought that thought, I said to myself,

01:19:56.579 --> 01:19:59.579
well, at least they feel good about themselves.

01:19:59.579 --> 01:20:01.579
How do you feel?

01:20:01.579 --> 01:20:05.579
And the answer was, I felt terrible.

01:20:05.579 --> 01:20:09.579
Eventually, skillful use of the scriptures and just reasoning with me,

01:20:09.579 --> 01:20:13.579
the elders got me to realize that I had been carried off

01:20:13.579 --> 01:20:16.579
or that I had been taken captive by human philosophy,

01:20:16.579 --> 01:20:22.579
by the deceptions and this empty reasoning of men.

01:20:22.579 --> 01:20:24.579
I actually said a prayer.

01:20:24.579 --> 01:20:29.579
I supplicated Jehovah that he would really show me the way to the truth.

01:20:29.579 --> 01:20:34.579
And he took away this feeling of emptiness, spiritually speaking.

01:20:34.579 --> 01:20:37.579
I realized that relationship with Jehovah,

01:20:37.579 --> 01:20:42.579
that's our most precious possession, I had to get back.

01:20:43.579 --> 01:20:46.579
I started to study the Bible with sincerity.

01:20:46.579 --> 01:20:49.579
I wanted it to affect my mind and my heart.

01:20:49.579 --> 01:20:52.579
And I wanted it to affect change in my behavior.

01:20:52.579 --> 01:20:56.579
Now, as I did that, I felt Jehovah blessing those efforts.

01:20:56.579 --> 01:21:01.579
He began to help me to rebuild that relationship with him.

01:21:01.579 --> 01:21:03.579
So I began to use Jehovah's name.

01:21:03.579 --> 01:21:08.579
Speaking about Jehovah became a wonderful joy and a great pleasure to me.

01:21:08.579 --> 01:21:11.579
And the result was that my ministry was very productive.

01:21:11.579 --> 01:21:17.579
And it's an amazing joy to be able to help someone come to love Jehovah.

01:21:17.579 --> 01:21:24.579
I was just so happy to be back under Jehovah's wings and have that peace of mind.

01:21:24.579 --> 01:21:27.579
How loving Jehovah is, he wants to help us.

01:21:27.579 --> 01:21:29.579
And what better help could we have?

01:21:29.579 --> 01:21:32.579
He's the best in the universe.

01:21:32.579 --> 01:21:36.579
Now, let's consider the second challenge we face.

01:21:36.579 --> 01:21:40.579
Negative reports about Jehovah's witnesses in the media.

01:21:40.579 --> 01:21:42.579
Now, here's a good principle to follow.

01:21:42.579 --> 01:21:46.579
Proverbs 14 and verse 15.

01:21:46.579 --> 01:21:48.579
I'll give you a moment.

01:21:48.579 --> 01:21:56.060
Proverbs 14 and verse 15.

01:21:56.060 --> 01:22:01.060
It says, the naive person believes every word,

01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:05.060
but the shrewd one ponders each step.

01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:11.300
Some people believe everything they read in the newspaper or see on TV.

01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:13.300
Do you?

01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:15.300
Should you?

01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:17.300
Consider this.

01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:19.300
Now, you're working from door to door.

01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:21.300
And you meet a householder who says,

01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:23.300
you and Jehovah's witnesses are terrible people.

01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:25.300
You let your children die.

01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:27.300
You don't accept medical treatment.

01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:29.300
Well, you asked the householder,

01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:31.300
do you know any of Jehovah's witnesses personally?

01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:32.300
No.

01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:36.300
Then, where did you get the idea that we let our children die?

01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:38.300
And don't accept medical treatment.

01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:40.300
The householder says,

01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:42.300
I have it on good authority.

01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:44.300
I read it in the newspaper.

01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:47.300
Well, if it's in the newspaper,

01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:49.300
it must be true, right?

01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:51.300
Not necessarily.

01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:53.300
Remember this.

01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:55.300
Reporters have a deadline to meet.

01:22:55.300 --> 01:23:00.300
And a reporter may not have the time or the inclination to check the facts.

01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:04.300
Or, the reporter may have written a balance article,

01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:06.300
but then the editor changes it.

01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:09.300
Maybe the editor doesn't like Jehovah's witnesses,

01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:12.300
or he's been misinformed about us.

01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:13.300
Now, it's bad enough.

01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:17.300
If people in the world believe everything they read in the newspaper,

01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:20.300
but brothers, let's not be among them.

01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:22.300
Let's not be naive.

01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:26.300
Let's consider things carefully.

01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:31.300
Similarly, sometimes there's a TV program about Jehovah's witnesses.

01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:35.300
Now, a few of these programs are balanced and fair.

01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:38.300
Many, or I dare say, most are not.

01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:42.300
And when they're not, you'll often find that the producers started out

01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:44.300
with a negative view of Jehovah's witnesses,

01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:48.300
and then they looked for information to support their prejudice.

01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:50.300
So whom did they turn to?

01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:52.300
Apostates and the clergy.

01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:56.300
From them, they got suggestions for people to interview.

01:23:56.300 --> 01:23:58.300
And we know what those people would say.

01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:00.300
At the very last minute,

01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:04.300
they may ask the brothers for comment just to give an appearance of fairness,

01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:07.300
but the program wasn't designed to be fair.

01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:09.300
It was designed to be unfair.

01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:14.300
It was slanted against Jehovah's witnesses.

01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:16.300
Now, let's be clear.

01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:20.300
Some news organizations are very conscientious about their reporting,

01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:23.300
and they want to present both sides of an issue.

01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:28.300
And when Jehovah's witnesses are concerned, they do so at their cost.

01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:31.300
If a newspaper publishes anything positive about us,

01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:33.300
the churches will push back.

01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:35.300
Our parishioners are upset.

01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:37.300
They subscribe to your newspaper,

01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:40.300
and they don't like reading favorable things about Jehovah's witnesses.

01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:43.300
The message, if it ever happens again,

01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:47.300
they're going to lose subscribers.

01:24:47.300 --> 01:24:53.300
Now, this matter of Jehovah's people being the subject of malicious reports

01:24:53.300 --> 01:24:55.300
isn't new.

01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:58.300
Think about the days of Queen Esther.

01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:03.300
Wicked Heyman brings a bad report to King Ahazuerus.

01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:05.300
The Jews don't obey our laws.

01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:08.300
They're a danger to society.

01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:11.300
Does Ahazuerus check the facts?

01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:13.300
Does he demand proof?

01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:14.300
No.

01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:16.300
Ahazuerus is naive.

01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:21.300
He allows himself to be taken in by Heyman.

01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:24.300
Well, there are a lot of modern day Heyman's today,

01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:27.300
and they use similar tactics.

01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:31.300
As a result, some government officials are taken in.

01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:35.300
They believe the slanderous accusations of the apostates.

01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:38.300
Now, if they just take the time to check the facts,

01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:40.300
they'd see that they're being lied to,

01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:42.300
but they don't check the facts.

01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:45.300
Now, again, it's bad enough, brothers,

01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:49.300
when government officials are taken in by false reports,

01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:51.300
don't you be taken in?

01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:58.609
Have you ever heard the expression trial by a media?

01:25:59.609 --> 01:26:02.609
It works like this, someone's charged with a crime,

01:26:02.609 --> 01:26:05.609
and the case is widely publicized in the media,

01:26:05.609 --> 01:26:08.609
and the media present the case in such a way

01:26:08.609 --> 01:26:12.609
that everyone who hears about it thinks the man is guilty.

01:26:12.609 --> 01:26:15.609
Of course, to avoid a lawsuit for slander or liable,

01:26:15.609 --> 01:26:19.609
these media reports are very carefully worded,

01:26:19.609 --> 01:26:21.609
and we need to understand what the wording means.

01:26:21.609 --> 01:26:23.609
Here's a good principle to keep in line.

01:26:23.609 --> 01:26:29.560
Job, chapter 12, and verse 11.

01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:32.560
It's amazing how many principles we can draw

01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:34.560
from the book of Job for this talk.

01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:38.560
Job, chapter 12, and verse 11.

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:42.560
This is Job speaking, and he says,

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:49.560
Does not the ear test out words as the tongue tastes food?

01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:52.560
Does not the ear test out words?

01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:54.560
What does that mean?

01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:56.560
Does it mean that if we learn that apostates

01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:58.560
are going to be featured on a TV program,

01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:02.560
we should watch it to see if what they say is true?

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:03.560
No.

01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:07.560
It basically means to consider the source of the words.

01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:10.560
If they are the words of apostates,

01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:12.560
why would we believe them?

01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:14.560
Now, think of it this way.

01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:17.560
You have a model on your self that's marked poison.

01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:19.560
Do you need to open it up?

01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:22.560
Take a swing to see if it really is poison?

01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:25.560
Believe what the label says.

01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:28.560
Now, for the purpose of this discussion,

01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:31.560
let's consider another way we can test out words.

01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:35.560
And that is to pay attention to what the words mean.

01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:37.560
Remember, we talked about media reports

01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:40.560
and how these are very often carefully worded

01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:43.560
to avoid a lawsuit.

01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:46.560
So suppose a report indicates that someone has been charged

01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:50.560
with a crime or that he's being investigated.

01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:52.560
All right, you have two words.

01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:55.560
Charged and investigated.

01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:58.560
It doesn't mean he's guilty.

01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:02.560
Or suppose that someone is convicted and put in jail.

01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:05.560
Well, that would apply to our young brothers in Korea, wouldn't it?

01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:07.560
They were convicted and jailed.

01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:09.560
And what was their crime?

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:12.560
They refused to kill someone?

01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:15.560
Did they do anything wrong?

01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:19.560
Or someone is found guilty by a man

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:23.560
as Jesus was and doesn't mean that he's guilty

01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:25.560
in the sight of God.

01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:28.560
So brothers, we really have to think about these things.

01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:32.560
We may read that a person or an organization was sued

01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:35.560
and then settled out of court.

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:39.560
Does settling out of court mean that they were guilty?

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:41.560
Not necessarily.

01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:43.560
Now, in this country and others,

01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:46.560
court cases are often handled by a jury.

01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:48.560
Now, who are on the jury?

01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:50.560
Ordinary citizens with no legal training.

01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:52.560
But not only that.

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:56.560
These ordinary citizens don't always have access to all the facts

01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:59.560
because the judge and lawyers decide which facts

01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:01.560
will be shared with the jury.

01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:05.560
So it's unlikely that the whole truth will ever come out in court.

01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:09.560
Actually, neither side probably wants the whole truth

01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:12.560
to come out in court.

01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:15.560
Now, sometimes attorneys deliberately withhold information

01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:18.560
that would be prejudicial to their clients.

01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:22.560
And in addition, centuries have prejudices like everyone else

01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:27.560
and some of them just can't set their prejudices aside.

01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:30.560
I'll tell you an actual experience.

01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:34.560
Some time ago, when lawyer told me about a case he had,

01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:39.560
that was a case of medical malpractice by a doctor.

01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:40.560
There was a jury.

01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:44.560
At that trial, their doctor was clearly shown to be in the wrong.

01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:48.560
But the jury didn't give the patient a penny.

01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:53.060
The lawyer was confused, so after the trial,

01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:55.060
he approached two of the jurors and asked,

01:29:55.060 --> 01:29:59.060
if you don't mind, tell me which part of the testimony you didn't believe.

01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:02.060
The jurors replied, oh, we didn't get that far.

01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:04.060
The doctor was cute.

01:30:04.060 --> 01:30:07.060
And we didn't want him to have to pay anything.

01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:09.060
With deep thinkers like that,

01:30:09.060 --> 01:30:12.060
no wonder many lawyers tried to settle their cases

01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:14.060
rather than bring them to a jury.

01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:19.600
But someone will say, no, I don't believe in settling out of court.

01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:21.600
I believe in justice and truth.

01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:23.600
So that brings up the question,

01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:28.600
is it wrong to settle a matter before it goes to trial?

01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:30.600
Or is it scriptural?

01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:32.600
Let's let Jesus answer that question.

01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:34.600
Turn to Matthew chapter 5,

01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:37.600
verses 25 and 26.

01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:45.659
Interesting that Jesus should mention this,

01:30:45.659 --> 01:30:50.659
with all the important things that Jesus taught.

01:30:50.659 --> 01:30:55.659
Matthew chapter 5, verses 25 and 26.

01:30:55.659 --> 01:31:00.659
Be quick to settle matters with your legal opponent

01:31:00.659 --> 01:31:04.659
while you are with him on the way there,

01:31:04.659 --> 01:31:07.659
so that somehow the opponent may not turn you over to the judge,

01:31:07.659 --> 01:31:10.659
and the judge to the court attendant,

01:31:10.659 --> 01:31:12.659
and you get thrown into prison.

01:31:12.659 --> 01:31:14.659
I say to you for a fact,

01:31:14.659 --> 01:31:16.659
you will certainly not come out of there

01:31:16.659 --> 01:31:20.659
until you have paid over your last small coin.

01:31:20.659 --> 01:31:24.199
Now this is interesting.

01:31:24.199 --> 01:31:26.199
Think about the Mosaic Law.

01:31:26.199 --> 01:31:28.199
Was there any provision in the Mosaic Law

01:31:28.199 --> 01:31:31.199
to throw someone in jail if he couldn't pay a debt?

01:31:31.199 --> 01:31:33.199
That wasn't the way.

01:31:33.199 --> 01:31:35.199
If he couldn't pay, he'd have to work it off.

01:31:35.199 --> 01:31:38.199
Or a family member would have to work it off.

01:31:38.199 --> 01:31:42.199
So when Jesus talks about prison and a judge,

01:31:42.199 --> 01:31:46.199
he's obviously referring to what a Gentile judge would do.

01:31:46.199 --> 01:31:50.199
And he couldn't necessarily expect justice from him.

01:31:50.199 --> 01:31:53.199
Why might he rule against our brother?

01:31:53.199 --> 01:31:57.199
Well, maybe he got paid under the table or the other party.

01:31:57.199 --> 01:32:00.199
Or maybe he was prejudiced against the race

01:32:00.199 --> 01:32:03.199
or the religion of the other party.

01:32:03.199 --> 01:32:06.199
Now notice, Jesus didn't say

01:32:06.199 --> 01:32:09.199
that the man should settle only if he was guilty.

01:32:10.199 --> 01:32:13.199
So brothers, let's not be nor leave.

01:32:13.199 --> 01:32:16.199
Don't believe everything you read.

01:32:16.199 --> 01:32:18.199
Just because an article is called a news report

01:32:18.199 --> 01:32:20.199
doesn't make it true.

01:32:20.199 --> 01:32:22.199
And an editorial that someone's opinion

01:32:22.199 --> 01:32:24.199
and that someone may be wrong.

01:32:24.199 --> 01:32:28.199
And TV producers may have their own agenda,

01:32:28.199 --> 01:32:32.199
prejudice, and viewpoint.

01:32:32.199 --> 01:32:36.199
So what do we say in revision?

01:32:36.199 --> 01:32:38.199
Inclusion.

01:32:38.199 --> 01:32:42.199
Our faith is under attack.

01:32:42.199 --> 01:32:44.199
And we have to fight.

01:32:44.199 --> 01:32:47.199
And Jehovah gives us what we need to fight with.

01:32:47.199 --> 01:32:50.199
One of the things he gives us, good associations.

01:32:50.199 --> 01:32:53.199
Satan will try to lure us away from good associations.

01:32:53.199 --> 01:32:56.199
He'll try to weaken our faith by getting us involved

01:32:56.199 --> 01:32:59.199
in bad association without our knowing.

01:32:59.199 --> 01:33:03.199
But Jehovah provides good association in the congregation.

01:33:03.199 --> 01:33:05.199
These are people we know.

01:33:05.199 --> 01:33:06.199
We love.

01:33:06.199 --> 01:33:10.199
These are people who have our best interests at heart.

01:33:10.199 --> 01:33:21.699
Keep in mind the principle we find at Proverbs 13 and verse 20.

01:33:21.699 --> 01:33:25.699
The one walking with the wise will become wise.

01:33:25.699 --> 01:33:30.699
But the one who has dealings with the stupid will fare badly.

01:33:30.699 --> 01:33:32.699
You know the members of your congregation.

01:33:32.699 --> 01:33:34.699
You know that they are wise.

01:33:34.699 --> 01:33:37.699
You know that they have your best interests at heart.

01:33:37.699 --> 01:33:40.699
But if you get involved in a forum,

01:33:40.699 --> 01:33:43.699
you might not know whether you're walking with wise persons or not.

01:33:43.699 --> 01:33:45.699
At least not at first.

01:33:45.699 --> 01:33:47.699
So be careful.

01:33:47.699 --> 01:33:52.699
If the conversation turns negative, get out.

01:33:52.699 --> 01:33:58.699
Satan is behind the twisted teachings of apostates.

01:33:58.699 --> 01:34:00.699
He's the father of the lie.

01:34:00.699 --> 01:34:05.699
And those who lie are doing exactly what their father does.

01:34:05.699 --> 01:34:08.699
The apostates have nothing to offer us, brothers.

01:34:08.699 --> 01:34:09.699
They offer us hate.

01:34:09.699 --> 01:34:13.699
All they have is to offer us criticism and negative talk.

01:34:13.699 --> 01:34:19.699
But oh, how upbuilt we feel when we're with those who love Jehovah.

01:34:19.699 --> 01:34:23.699
So Jehovah provides us with good, wholesome associations.

01:34:23.699 --> 01:34:26.699
He also provides us with his word of truth.

01:34:26.699 --> 01:34:31.699
Had an accurate knowledge of the truth is the best defense against apostasy.

01:34:31.699 --> 01:34:34.699
Read the Bible every day and meditate on it.

01:34:34.699 --> 01:34:35.699
Pay attention to the words.

01:34:35.699 --> 01:34:37.699
Pay attention to what they mean.

01:34:37.699 --> 01:34:42.699
Be like the Bereans, referred to at Acts chapter 17.

01:34:42.699 --> 01:34:44.699
And verses 10 and 11.

01:34:44.699 --> 01:34:46.699
Let's read that.

01:34:46.699 --> 01:34:51.699
Acts chapter 17, verses 10 and 11.

01:34:51.699 --> 01:34:58.329
Immediately by night, the brothers sent both Paul and Silas to Berea,

01:34:58.329 --> 01:35:01.329
on arriving the winner of the synagogue of the Jews.

01:35:01.329 --> 01:35:05.329
Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica.

01:35:05.329 --> 01:35:09.329
For they accepted the word with the greatest eagerness of mind,

01:35:09.329 --> 01:35:13.329
carefully examining the scriptures daily,

01:35:13.329 --> 01:35:16.329
carefully examining the scriptures daily,

01:35:16.329 --> 01:35:20.329
to see whether these things were so.

01:35:20.329 --> 01:35:25.329
Now Paul compares the Bereans with the Thessalonians.

01:35:25.329 --> 01:35:27.329
What do we know about the Thessalonians?

01:35:27.329 --> 01:35:30.329
Well, they didn't have YouTube in those days.

01:35:30.329 --> 01:35:33.329
But at one point, the Thessalonians apparently heard a rumor

01:35:33.329 --> 01:35:36.329
that the day of Jehovah had arrived.

01:35:36.329 --> 01:35:38.329
Who circulated the rumor?

01:35:38.329 --> 01:35:39.329
An apostate?

01:35:39.329 --> 01:35:40.329
Maybe.

01:35:40.329 --> 01:35:43.329
But maybe it was just someone who had heard the rumor

01:35:43.329 --> 01:35:46.329
and passed it on without checking it out.

01:35:46.329 --> 01:35:47.329
Have you ever done that?

01:35:47.329 --> 01:35:51.329
Passed on a report without checking the facts?

01:35:51.329 --> 01:35:55.329
I think all of us have to admit that we've been guilty of that

01:35:55.329 --> 01:35:56.329
at one time or another.

01:35:56.329 --> 01:35:59.329
But now how did the Thessalonians react?

01:35:59.329 --> 01:36:01.329
They were alarmed.

01:36:01.329 --> 01:36:04.329
They were quickly shaken from their reason.

01:36:04.329 --> 01:36:06.329
We mustn't let that happen to us.

01:36:06.329 --> 01:36:09.329
When you hear something, check it out.

01:36:09.329 --> 01:36:11.329
Don't just circulate it.

01:36:11.329 --> 01:36:12.329
Don't just believe it.

01:36:12.329 --> 01:36:14.329
Check it out.

01:36:14.329 --> 01:36:16.329
Colossians 2, 6 and 7.

01:36:16.329 --> 01:36:18.329
The last scripture we'll read during this talk.

01:36:18.329 --> 01:36:20.329
Now here, Paul,

01:36:20.329 --> 01:36:24.329
explains how we can avoid being quickly shaken from our reason.

01:36:24.329 --> 01:36:26.329
Let's read this final scripture.

01:36:26.329 --> 01:36:30.329
Colossians chapter 2, verses 6 and 7.

01:36:30.329 --> 01:36:33.829
Therefore,

01:36:33.829 --> 01:36:36.829
just as you have accepted Christ Jesus the Lord,

01:36:36.829 --> 01:36:39.829
go on walking in union with Him.

01:36:39.829 --> 01:36:42.829
You do that and you'll be walking with a wise one, certainly,

01:36:42.829 --> 01:36:47.829
being rooted and built up in Him and then notices

01:36:47.829 --> 01:36:53.829
and being stabilized in the faith just as you were taught.

01:36:53.829 --> 01:36:55.829
If we're stabilized in the faith,

01:36:55.829 --> 01:36:59.829
we won't be quickly shaken by unfounded accusations

01:36:59.829 --> 01:37:01.829
by apostates or the media.

01:37:01.829 --> 01:37:08.659
False rumors are often spread during wartime.

01:37:08.659 --> 01:37:11.659
Brothers, this is war.

01:37:11.659 --> 01:37:14.659
We need to put up a hard fight for the faith

01:37:14.659 --> 01:37:17.659
as if our life depended on it,

01:37:17.659 --> 01:37:19.659
because it does.

01:37:19.659 --> 01:37:22.479
Thank you, brothers,

01:37:22.479 --> 01:37:25.479
plain for that insightful talk.

01:37:25.479 --> 01:37:29.479
This session has helped us to safeguard our faith

01:37:29.479 --> 01:37:31.479
and to act in faith.

01:37:32.479 --> 01:37:36.479
What can we look forward to in the next two sessions?

01:37:36.479 --> 01:37:40.479
The scripture theme is Matthew 21, verse 21,

01:37:40.479 --> 01:37:42.479
which says in part,

01:37:42.479 --> 01:37:44.479
if you have faith,

01:37:44.479 --> 01:37:46.479
it will happen.

01:37:46.479 --> 01:37:49.479
The next session begins with the symposium highlighting

01:37:49.479 --> 01:37:52.479
women of strong faith,

01:37:52.479 --> 01:37:56.479
and we eagerly anticipate the public Bible discourse

01:37:56.479 --> 01:38:00.479
have faith in the good news.

01:38:00.479 --> 01:38:03.479
Now let's sing together song number 38,

01:38:03.479 --> 01:38:08.479
which draws attention to our source of power, Jehovah God.

01:38:08.479 --> 01:38:10.479
This song is entitled,

01:38:10.479 --> 01:38:12.479
He will make you strong.

01:38:12.479 --> 01:38:14.479
After the song,

01:38:14.479 --> 01:38:17.479
you may have your local concluding prayer.

01:38:17.479 --> 01:38:20.479
Again, that song number 38.
