WEBVTT

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.089
Brothers and sisters, welcome to this update.

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:11.890
No doubt we're all still thinking about the memorial of Christ's death and the great love

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.130
that Jehovah and Jesus have shown.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:21.050
And it was so good that many of us were able to be together in person for this most important

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.609
occasion of the year.

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:28.969
Were you excited when you heard that we would resume in-person meetings worldwide on April

00:00:28.969 --> 00:00:30.850
1st?

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.810
The governing body really felt Jehovah's direction when making that decision.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.210
And we were excited to share it, less than two hours after our meeting, the breaking

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.409
news was posted.

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:49.009
Luckily, you can identify with the feelings of our brothers and sisters in the following

00:00:49.009 --> 00:01:37.829
video.

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.150
Now going back to the kingdom hall, it's wonderful seeing the brothers and sisters, hugging them,

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.150
it's emotional.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:02:15.430
Clearly, Jehovah knows what we need.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.430
I'm very excited and happy to be here hearing everybody's comments.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.629
Well, my stomach was in marks this morning, but right now I'm really excited and happy

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.110
that we're all here.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:33.990
For Jehovah's people to get back to worship together at meetings, talk about a spiritual

00:02:33.990 --> 00:03:46.780
paradise.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:55.340
Seeing one another face to face, or more accurately, mask to mask, after so long, was wonderful.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:03.580
Bringing together, praying together, meeting new ones in person, all of this is so refreshing.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.900
One seven year old girl said, I have never been more patient in my life than waiting to go

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.419
back to the kingdom hall for two years.

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:20.980
I return to the kingdom hall has been possible because in many ways we're in another phase

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.540
of the pandemic.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.019
Now that there is a high rate of vaccination and new treatments are becoming available,

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:32.620
many governments have relaxed restrictions.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:38.579
In various parts of the world, life is somewhat returning to normal.

00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:40.500
What does it mean?

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:47.420
We're all learning to live with COVID-19 while still taking reasonable precautions.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:54.500
In time we look forward to being able to resume additional theoretic activities.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.139
Now for the rest of our update, we're going to talk about the situation in Ukraine and

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:02.139
Russia.

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.579
How are our brothers and sisters in those countries doing?

00:05:06.579 --> 00:05:12.899
How can we cope with any anxiety we may feel about the situation?

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:18.779
I'm sure we've all appreciated the timely updates on JW.org.

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:23.620
Our brothers and sisters in Eastern Europe have had a wonderful share in the ministry

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.939
despite war and the pandemic.

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:31.459
We are deeply touched by their godly devotion.

00:05:31.459 --> 00:05:37.139
The branch office in Ukraine is functioning and actively assisting tens of thousands

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:39.779
of refugees.

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:47.860
The branch reports that as of Monday April 18, over 42,000 of our brothers and sisters

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.379
in Ukraine have been displaced.

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:56.779
Most in 19,000 have chosen to flee to other countries.

00:05:56.779 --> 00:06:04.259
We are deeply saddened to report that 32 brothers and sisters have died.

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:08.579
How should we view this situation?

00:06:08.579 --> 00:06:13.779
Recall Jesus' words when he described the sign of his presence as recorded at Matthew

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:16.060
24-6.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:23.300
He said, You are going to hear of wars and reports of wars.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:29.620
Some Bible scholars say that this means wars that are nearby and wars that are in distant

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.579
places.

00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:37.939
One translation says, You are going to hear the noise of battles close by and the news

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:41.019
of battles far away.

00:06:41.019 --> 00:06:43.540
And that's true today.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:52.100
Some of us are hearing the sounds of war nearby, others are hearing of wars in distant lands.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:57.779
These news reports often involve graphic pictures of bloodshed.

00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:02.899
At times it seems like we are right there in the middle of the battle.

00:07:02.899 --> 00:07:09.139
Additionally, we see and hear reports of how our brothers are affected.

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:11.379
How do you feel?

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:18.379
We are overwhelmed, shocked, angry, traumatized.

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:21.939
We feel the pain of our brothers and sisters.

00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:28.620
At times we may even ask, Why does Jehovah allow this?

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:34.139
It's only natural to feel that way, but we need to be careful.

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:36.220
What did Jesus say?

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:42.980
The rest of Matthew 24-6 says, See that you are not alarmed.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:49.180
For these things must take place, but the end is not yet.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.579
Do not be alarmed.

00:07:51.579 --> 00:07:57.500
Or as another translation says, Take care not to be scared out of your wits.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:04.639
And another says, Be sure that you don't get upset.

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:07.959
What will help us not to be alarmed?

00:08:07.959 --> 00:08:11.120
Here are four points.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:17.920
First one, Remember why Jehovah permits our brothers to be affected by war.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.199
Think of Job's example.

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:25.560
At Job 1-10 Satan complained to Jehovah.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:32.840
Have you not put up a protective hedge around him and his house and everything he has?

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:41.240
Satan claimed that Job, and by extension all humans, served Jehovah only for selfish reasons.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.759
Jehovah allowed Job to lose everything.

00:08:44.759 --> 00:08:49.840
And yet Job kept his integrity and proved Satan a liar.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.320
The same is true today.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.320
Some of our dear brothers and sisters have lost everything.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:01.840
They are homes, their possessions, their jobs, and even their loved ones, as they have

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.360
fled the conflict.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:10.120
But as our brothers and sisters remain loyal to Jehovah, despite war and other hardships,

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:16.710
they give a loud reply to Satan's taunts about Jehovah's sovereignty.

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:22.870
Second, We need to be realistic in our expectations.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:27.950
Recall that in the first century, Stephen and James were executed.

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:33.470
Jesus disciples fled Jerusalem and lost their possessions.

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:38.429
These types of things have already happened since 1914.

00:09:38.429 --> 00:09:43.870
Some of us have been born in a generation where we have not witnessed firsthand the effects

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:45.470
of war.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:51.070
And yet many of our brothers and sisters have had to live through wars and civil unrest

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:53.070
of all sorts.

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:58.710
And some in various places are experiencing it now.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:05.029
But how encouraging to consider that so many have faithfully and successfully endured

00:10:05.029 --> 00:10:08.190
such challenging times.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:14.149
Of course, the fact that we see these events occurring is evidence that Jehovah will soon

00:10:14.149 --> 00:10:20.629
intervene and put an end to all these wicked things we see in the world today.

00:10:20.629 --> 00:10:26.269
As one brother said, the disciples weren't asking because they wanted to know when these

00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:29.110
things would get really bad.

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:33.190
They wanted to know when was the solution?

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:37.200
When was the fix going to come?

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:45.279
Third, we remember that this is an opportunity to show our trust in Jehovah.

00:10:45.279 --> 00:10:52.000
This reminds me of an experience of a couple in Japan who had lost everything in a flood.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.759
They said, we thought that we trusted in Jehovah before.

00:10:57.759 --> 00:11:02.240
But now we really know what it means.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:08.440
And as one missionary commented, it's not until your back is against the wall that you

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.440
see Jehovah's hand.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:17.440
So we keep in mind the words recorded at Isaiah 30 and verse 15.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:22.559
Your strength will be in keeping calm and showing trust.

00:11:22.559 --> 00:11:27.360
Yes, we remain calm and show our trust in Jehovah.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:33.879
We have absolute confidence that he knows our brothers needs and will care for them.

00:11:33.879 --> 00:11:44.960
As our 2022 year text Psalm 3410 reminds us, those seeking Jehovah will act nothing good.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:49.759
This we could illustrate this with a caregiving situation.

00:11:49.759 --> 00:11:56.720
When we are caring for a loved one who is suffering, it can be harder than if we were the one

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.480
suffering.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.600
Why is that?

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:07.200
Because when we are the one suffering a problem and we rely on Jehovah, we experience the

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.360
peace that only he can provide.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:16.279
So for the caregiver of observing it, it can be much harder.

00:12:16.279 --> 00:12:23.399
The caregiver's imagination can run wild with all the problems and worries and what ifs.

00:12:23.399 --> 00:12:25.639
Do we see the point?

00:12:25.639 --> 00:12:31.080
When it comes to our brothers and sisters who are affected by the war in Eastern Europe,

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.559
we are much like a caregiver.

00:12:33.559 --> 00:12:40.279
We can send about them, but that's different than actually being in the situation.

00:12:40.279 --> 00:12:45.679
Jehovah gives his Holy Spirit according to the actual need.

00:12:45.679 --> 00:12:51.039
So we're sure that Jehovah is providing just what our brothers and sisters in Eastern

00:12:51.039 --> 00:12:54.080
Europe need at this time.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:13:00.600
When we remember this, it can help us to cope with our anxiety.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.879
What's the fourth point that can help us?

00:13:03.879 --> 00:13:07.279
We must remain neutral.

00:13:07.279 --> 00:13:13.679
We realize that many news reports may be propaganda that's designed and slanted to motivate

00:13:13.679 --> 00:13:16.720
listeners to take sides.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.440
How do we respond when we hear such reports?

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:26.600
We safeguard our hearts and minds, realizing that all human governments will soon be replaced

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.919
by God's kingdom.

00:13:28.919 --> 00:13:34.480
We know that no human efforts can bring true peace and security to the earth.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.679
Only God's kingdom can and will do so.

00:13:38.679 --> 00:13:44.720
Therefore, our hearts and minds are devoted to that kingdom.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:49.679
We've discussed four things that can help us not to be terrified by the events in Eastern

00:13:49.679 --> 00:13:51.519
Europe.

00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:56.000
We remember why Jehovah allows these things?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.519
We keep realistic expectations.

00:13:59.519 --> 00:14:06.580
We show our trust in Jehovah and we remain neutral.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:11.779
Let us hope some of our brothers and sisters to deal successfully with hearing of wars

00:14:11.779 --> 00:14:14.580
and reports of wars.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:19.370
Let's watch the following video.

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:25.289
While reading the news about the horrific effects of the bombings, I felt cut to the heart.

00:14:25.289 --> 00:14:30.370
Feelings of powerlessness and helplessness overwhelmed me.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:35.049
When you feel overwhelmed by all the news reports on the war, you pretty much get pulled

00:14:35.049 --> 00:14:38.009
into everything that's happening.

00:14:38.009 --> 00:14:40.929
It definitely affects you and your thinking.

00:14:40.929 --> 00:14:44.929
In your neutrality can really be put to the test.

00:14:44.929 --> 00:14:51.370
My family lives in Ukraine, so from the beginning of the war, I was worried about their safety.

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:57.090
To keep up to date with what was happening with them, I tried to call them every day.

00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:01.889
What I learned from them affected me a lot and it didn't allow me to think calmly about

00:15:01.889 --> 00:15:04.409
the situation.

00:15:04.409 --> 00:15:08.730
I was moved by the stories of our brothers who had to flee their homes with their children

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:11.970
in order to save their lives.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:15.409
I have found that reading the Bible often works well for me.

00:15:15.409 --> 00:15:19.570
I read it in the morning, during the day, and before going to bed.

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:24.970
It removes negative images and emotions from my mind, and more importantly, it often

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:31.690
allows me, so to speak, to hear God's voice and regain my emotional balance.

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:36.330
I tried to reflect on how Jehovah had protected his servants in the past.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:41.850
I also imagined the times described in Psalm 46 verse 9, which says that Jehovah is bringing

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:44.970
an end to wars throughout the earth.

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:50.370
This verse reinforces my belief that soon Jehovah will destroy all weapons, and there

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:52.970
will be peace in all the earth.

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:55.409
I tried to pray about specific individuals.

00:15:55.409 --> 00:15:59.970
It helps me to be more effective in giving practical help.

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:05.590
I've made a real effort to follow less news on the war.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:11.509
What has really helped is following the news releases on our website, JW.org, about

00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:17.669
brothers and sisters from different countries, not just Ukraine and Russia.

00:16:17.669 --> 00:16:24.350
Their example of neutrality and loyalty has also helped me to keep my focus.

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:29.149
A lot of things convince me that the only solution is God's kingdom.

00:16:29.149 --> 00:16:34.230
First of all, the stark contrast between Jehovah's people and the people who do not believe

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:35.629
in him.

00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:38.629
There's no prejudice, no injustice.

00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:43.870
We're motivated by love for each other, and it's beautiful to see that in every country.

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:47.110
We don't get carried away with our own different backgrounds.

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:50.870
It's beautiful to see that it's possible even now.

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:56.830
I'm sure that Jehovah, by means of his kingdom, once and is able to undo all the harm that

00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:01.909
results from human rule, I'm convinced that only God's kingdom can provide a lasting

00:17:01.909 --> 00:17:04.190
solution to all problems.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:09.589
I fully believe in what Jehovah says, because it's always true.

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:17.890
Soon when God's kingdom rules over the whole earth, then we'll really enjoy peace.

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:22.410
Did you notice how they cope with the trauma of news reports?

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:25.890
They focus on God's kingdom as a solution.

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:31.690
They limit the amount of news they consume, meditate on how Jehovah has helped his servants

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:39.650
in the past, pray frequently, and focus on the time when there will be no more war,

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:43.650
but instead lasting peace.

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:48.259
No doubt these same things will help us too.

00:17:48.259 --> 00:17:55.460
Jehovah understands that we need not only physical support, but also emotional support.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:18:02.900
For example, think about the latest The Wake magazine entitled A World in Turmoil How

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.059
You Can Cope.

00:18:05.059 --> 00:18:12.339
It highlights how you can protect your health, livelihood, relationships, and your hope.

00:18:12.339 --> 00:18:16.900
And for each of these topics, it includes helpful tips.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:20.579
That is food at the proper time.

00:18:20.579 --> 00:18:26.180
In the midst of all this turmoil in Eastern Europe, it has been so encouraging to hear

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:31.140
of the generosity of our brothers and sisters in nearby lands.

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:36.660
Tens of thousands have offered accommodations to those who are displaced.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:41.980
Many are helping with relief efforts, whether it is assisting those who arrive at border

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:48.859
crossings, at relief centers, or providing food and other basic items.

00:18:48.859 --> 00:18:56.180
As of their proximity to Ukraine, our brothers in Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia,

00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:03.259
and other lands have been very busy in coordinating relief efforts in their branch territories.

00:19:03.259 --> 00:19:08.940
And many are working hard to help our refugee brothers and sisters to get settled and

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.539
back on their feet.

00:19:11.539 --> 00:19:18.380
We continue to keep all you dear brothers and sisters in our prayers.

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:24.299
As we have discussed, we do not need to be alarmed by wars and reports of wars.

00:19:24.299 --> 00:19:33.259
Rather, we have full confidence that Jehovah will continue to care for his precious sheep.

00:19:33.259 --> 00:19:38.339
