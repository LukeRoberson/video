00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.790
Courage isn't something that comes easy.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.589
I suddenly felt really insecure and afraid.

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:15.789
Everyone was against me.

00:00:17.469 --> 00:00:19.269
I knew that no matter what,

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.870
this was going to hurt my family.

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:24.469
Inside,

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.870
I just feel broken.

00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:31.070
It was like having a lie in front of me.

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:35.369
Jehovah said that,

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:37.770
they will certainly fight against you,

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.969
but they will not prevail against you.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.969
For I am with you.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.170
Be courageous,

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.170
and strong,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.369
and go to work.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.570
I will fortify you.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.969
Yes, I will help you.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.969
Take your position.

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:56.570
Stand still,

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.369
and see the salvation of Jehovah in your behalf.
