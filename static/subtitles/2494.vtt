00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:12.380
Oh, Caleb, do you remember where Samuel served?

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.380
Uh, the tabernacle.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.379
Good. That was like his house.

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:22.379
But it was also Jehovah's house.

00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:25.379
How do you think he treated it?

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:27.379
Oh, he kept the clean.

00:00:27.379 --> 00:00:30.379
That's right.

00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:33.380
The king know how it's like Jehovah's house too.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.100
How should we treat it?

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:58.039
Nice job, Caleb.

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.039
When we keep the kingdom hall clean,

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:03.039
we show Jehovah that we love him.
