00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:23.339
When I first started having some health problems, my biggest concern was my goals.

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:29.100
With health situations, it's easy to get overwhelmed.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:35.340
I had to find a part-time job that is agreeable to my pioneering schedule and to my energy

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.399
levels.

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.880
I was offered after high school the opportunity to attend a prestigious university for no

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.079
cost.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.320
But Jehovah invites you to rely on him, not to rely on yourself.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.880
Growing up, my family didn't have a lot materially.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:03.909
It caused me to have a tendency to want to rely on myself instead of Jehovah.

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:08.909
I realized that I needed to have more trust in Jehovah, and that was going to require

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.909
working on my feet.

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.189
These relights were given a wonderful provision from Jehovah when they were hungry and

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.629
need a food of mana.

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:25.349
And they had to show contentment throughout the whole 40 years of them being in the wilderness.

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:30.189
It's not ideal to have to cut back on things for financial reasons, but being okay with

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:35.750
it and adapting to it, that shows Jehovah that we're content with what he's given us,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.469
and it helps us to be able to enjoy life and enjoy our full-time ministry that way.

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:47.150
I appreciated David's example because he stuck to Jehovah through several trials, and

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.709
each time he saw Jehovah's hand, and I thought that must have impressed on him the importance

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:59.430
of relying on Jehovah, and it probably helped him to have faith that Jehovah was going

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.469
to be there again the next time.

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:06.469
We were pioneering in our hometown, we had everything we needed.

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:11.069
I was set up with a job where I could work three days a week, and it was the perfect

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.669
pioneer job, but we wanted something more, so we decided to move where the need was

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:17.909
greater in the Chinese field.

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:23.550
I decided to find a part-time job that provided the means necessary to pay for things like

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.669
food and clothing, but really it was going to provide me with an opportunity to focus

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:29.629
on that service to Jehovah.

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:36.389
After some time I realized that the job I'd originally taken was not providing what I needed

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.189
any more, a change was necessary.

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:45.550
So another opportunity came up to pursue higher education, while I was considering my options

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.110
a friend recommended a job that required a little bit of vocational training, but would

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.330
pay to cover my expenses.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.650
Psalm chapter 23 and verse 1 has absolutely been true for us.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.210
There's never been a moment where we went hungry, there's never been a moment where we didn't

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.770
have what we needed.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.210
And challenges have come up, he's always led us through those challenges and helped

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.449
us to overcome.

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:23.490
I was able to find a way to work remotely from home, so I could control my energy level,

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.449
and I could control my own schedule.

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:31.930
Ministry has been such a comfort, since it's far back as I can remember for any trials

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.689
we face, just going in service, we always come home smiling.

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:43.009
For us it was always, if you can do it, do it, because it will make you happy and will

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:45.689
make life more enjoyable.

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.650
Working at the assembly hall is an enormous privilege.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.689
It's great to work in Jehovah's organizations to see how it works, to receive training,

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:59.210
and at the same time, it's an opportunity to meet even more people who are all putting

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.289
Jehovah first.

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:06.050
Looking back on it, I realized that Jehovah gave us that time to work for him so that

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.250
he could show his power to us in a way that was undeniable.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.810
When this watchtower came out, I said, everything is true.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.649
Yeah, every single principle, tasty and see that Jehovah is good, and Jehovah is my

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:23.050
shepherd, I'll lack nothing.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.449
It's all true.

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:27.410
My experience, my life, has been a testimony to that.
