00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:27.609
Welcome to JW Broadcasting for December 2022. On September 10th, 24 students reached

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:33.929
a milestone and graduated from the 152nd Class of Gilead. Many of the students were initially

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:40.770
invited to attend the school, but patiently waited until COVID-19 restrictions eased.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.530
Now after five months of intensive study, how will they apply their training? How can they

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.689
succeed in their assignments? And how can they strengthen their brothers and sisters? These questions

00:00:52.689 --> 00:01:01.570
and more are answered in part one of this Gilead graduation program. Well, this day has arrived for

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:08.049
your students. I see you there smiling and looking forward to this program. I'm sure it's hard for

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:15.090
you to believe that we've actually got to graduation day. But we also know that you're very keen and

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.890
enthusiastic to get to your assignments, whether you're going back to where you came from or you're

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.329
going to a new assignment. Over the last few months, you've learned so much haven't you? You've

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:32.370
crammed those, that information into your mind and heart. And now you've got that ready to

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:40.530
implement when you go to your assignments. But we need to be careful not only to be enthusiastic,

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:48.609
keen and zealous, but also we need to be patient. So we'd like to talk to you for a few moments about

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:57.969
this theme. Be enthusiastic, but be patient as well. Why so? Well, when you go to your assignments

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.209
with all this that you've learned, you're going to be tempted to try and implement it everywhere.

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.289
But remember, you're not going to change the whole world in one day, or even the whole

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:19.650
branch. You see, it's so easy to become overwhelmed if we try to take on too much all at one time.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.889
So that's why it's important to be enthusiastic, but also patient.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.409
How Lord Jesus Christ was an excellent example of this. When Jesus came into the world,

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:39.569
the whole world needed to hear his message. And yet he had to wait some 30 years,

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.129
growing up, according to Jehovah's time table, before he started his ministry. So that took

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:54.689
patience on his part, didn't it? But what about when Jesus started his ministry? What was his focus?

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.289
You can imagine him looking around, seeing all the things that needed to be done in the world at

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:08.689
that point. But let's turn our Bibles. If you turn with me, please to Matthew 15, Matthew 15 and

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:20.129
verse 24. And here Jesus said to his apostles, I was not sent to anyone except the lost sheep of

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:28.930
the house of Israel. That's interesting. Jesus here mentions he had a specific limited assignment.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:36.050
What was the assignment? To go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Now if we turn back

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:43.409
just a couple of chapters in chapter 10 of Matthew, you notice in verses 5 and 6 when Jesus sent out

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:52.289
his apostles, what did he say to them? Do not go off into the road of the nations and do not enter

00:03:52.370 --> 00:04:00.689
any Samaritan city. But instead, go continually to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:08.849
So as Jesus sent out his apostles, in this particular instance, what was he reminding them of?

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:16.209
He was telling them that they likewise had a limited assignment, a specific assignment.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.730
They weren't supposed to try and do everything all at once, go to the Samaritans to the Gentiles.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.649
They were to focus just on the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:33.810
So when we think about this, what do we learn from these two verses? Well first of all,

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:41.250
yes, the whole world needed to hear the message. But what did Jesus do and what did he expect of

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:49.009
his apostles? That they would recognize that they had a specific assignment. They weren't to be

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:55.490
overwhelmed by trying to think of changing the whole world at that point. Jesus showed great

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:02.850
trust in Jehovah. He knew that Jehovah would gradually expand the message and the reach of the

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:10.689
message. And of course, we realize that there was an expansion, then in 36 CE, another expansion.

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:17.810
So what does that mean for you? You see, when you return to your assignment or you go to the new

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:24.610
one, there's going to be endless number of possibilities of where you could help others,

00:05:25.329 --> 00:05:30.529
to stabilize, strengthen everyone. But if you try to take everything on at once,

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:35.569
you're going to wear yourself out and probably wear out a whole lot of other people as well.

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:42.050
You know, the English idiom, don't bite off more than you can chew. You see,

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:49.009
gradually do the things that Jehovah has assigned you to do. If you try to be too broad in what

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:56.769
you do, you may end up not accomplishing much at all except just wearing yourself out. But be patient

00:05:56.769 --> 00:06:03.410
just as Jesus was and recognizing that each one of you will have a specific assignment and then

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:11.089
try to work at that, trusting that Jehovah will allow your good example to benefit others and

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:18.529
gradually the effects of your work will spread to others. Now, an example of this is the South

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:24.050
Pacific. If I could just tell you about that. Now, when missionaries arrive in the South Pacific,

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:32.209
let's take for example, you might end up in a country that has 100 inhabited islands. Now,

00:06:32.209 --> 00:06:39.649
you're a new missionary. I remember the feeling. And then you find out there's only 10 islands that

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:46.769
have Jehovah's Witnesses on. 10 islands that have publishers and congregations. So there's 90 that

00:06:46.769 --> 00:06:54.209
don't. So what do you think the normal enthusiastic responses? Let's get a boat. We have to get a boat.

00:06:54.209 --> 00:07:02.129
We must visit all the 90 islands. That needs to be done now immediately. Well, usually you're

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:10.050
assigned to one congregation in one area. Now, what's the point? What normally happens? Well,

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.290
you see, if you were to get a boat and there's nothing wrong with getting a boat or visiting out of

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:20.449
the Rollins, but if that becomes your focus in your neglect your assignment, how can you follow up

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:25.410
on all the interests that you may find on those 90 islands? It's not just enough to go and give

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:31.569
them some magazines, but you need to be there with them, build them up, and congregations are formed.

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:39.970
So normally what happens? Well, it's amazing to see missionaries and others who work in maybe

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:48.290
larger city areas. They work diligently at their assignments. But then maybe others from different

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:54.769
islands come to visit that city, the missionaries are in, and they get contacted. They show an interest.

00:07:54.769 --> 00:08:01.730
They start to study. They return to their home islands and what happens gradually the work spreads

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:08.850
out to all these islands. So what's the point? Don't feel that you have to take on everything.

00:08:10.129 --> 00:08:17.009
Focus as Jesus did on the limited assignment you have, but then along the way you may be surprised

00:08:17.009 --> 00:08:24.610
at what happens. Now that's exactly what happened to Jesus. Let's go back to Matthew

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:34.210
chapter 15. Remember what was the assignment that Jesus had? In verse 24 he mentioned Israel.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:42.850
Now looking at this map we see at that time there was actually a border around that area that we

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:50.929
could say was his territory assignment. But when Jesus said these words where was he? Do you remember?

00:08:50.929 --> 00:08:57.250
Let's look at verse 21. Jesus now went into the region of Tyre and Sidon.

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:05.889
So when you look at the map where was Tyre and Sidon? What do you notice? He said he wasn't in his

00:09:05.889 --> 00:09:14.929
territory. He was out among the Gentiles. Why? But when we look at the parallel account that's

00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:21.409
mentioned in Mark chapter 7 it tells us that Jesus wanted some time alone with his apostles,

00:09:21.409 --> 00:09:27.570
some downtime because there was so many crowds. I was so busy. Now I'm sure all of us can understand

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:35.649
that feeling Jesus had. So he took them out of that general area to this territory that was beyond

00:09:35.649 --> 00:09:40.850
what he would normally preach in to have some quiet time together. But what happened?

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:47.330
Well the account tells us there was a Sorrow Phoenician woman, perhaps as the study notes help us

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:54.690
to see from a Greek background as far as a nationality went but maybe she was a citizen or an

00:09:54.690 --> 00:10:02.289
inhabitant of that area, the Sorrow Phoenician area. So this woman approached Jesus, pleading with

00:10:02.289 --> 00:10:07.649
him. Now she didn't look like a Jewish person. She probably didn't even speak Hebrew.

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:13.570
She certainly wasn't in the category of the lost ones of the House of Israel.

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:21.409
So Jesus initially when she started to make these efforts to talk to him, he mentioned this to his

00:10:21.409 --> 00:10:29.809
apostles in verse 24. That's our assignment. But notice this was a little different in the sense that

00:10:29.889 --> 00:10:38.210
this woman showed an appreciation for who Jesus was. Notice in verse 22, she said,

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:47.409
have mercy on me, Lord, son of David. Now here's a Gentile woman. She really know who David was

00:10:48.129 --> 00:10:54.370
and by saying the son of David, as the study note indicates, perhaps she was showing face

00:10:54.450 --> 00:11:01.090
in the fact that Jesus is the Messiah. So she wasn't your average Sorrow Phoenician person.

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:09.330
What did Jesus do? Well, he tested her little. He did emphasize the fact in a household.

00:11:10.289 --> 00:11:16.129
You first of all feed the children, the family. And then the little dogs get fed afterwards.

00:11:16.129 --> 00:11:21.409
And perhaps he was playing on words there. It's interesting. We're not sure what language Jesus

00:11:21.409 --> 00:11:27.090
was speaking to her. The watchtower did say that Jesus perhaps did understand Greek and use it

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:32.210
at times. Why his apostles obviously understood some Greek. They wrote some of the books of the

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:39.970
Bible in Greek. But whatever the case, the record of this is written, the inspired record is in Greek.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:48.049
And it uses this term little dogs. Was that an offensive? No. As it's mentioned, it was an affectionate

00:11:48.529 --> 00:11:55.889
term like saying puppies or pets. So whatever the case, he must have looked very friendly,

00:11:55.889 --> 00:12:01.649
perhaps out of the smaller in his face, because she was not deterred. What was Jesus' reaction?

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:08.210
Well, he acknowledged his territory, his assignment. But then in verse 28, he said,

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:13.809
Oh woman, great is your faith. Let it happen to you as you wish.

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:20.210
Is this the only time that Jesus did something like this for a non-Jewish person?

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:26.610
Remember in John chapter 4? Not only do we have this case of the Sire of a Nation woman,

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:34.450
but John 4, we've told about the Samaritan woman. This non-Jewish person was witness to.

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:40.850
And then even members of her village accepted Jesus as the Messiah.

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:49.490
And then what about the Roman army officer that Jesus was able to help? And he mentioned that Jesus

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:56.370
hadn't even seen that type of faith in all of Israel. So what lesson do we learn from this?

00:12:57.649 --> 00:13:04.129
Well, Jesus focused on his assignment. He always acknowledged what he's assigned to do.

00:13:05.009 --> 00:13:12.450
But when opportunities came up along the way to help those who weren't necessarily in his assignment,

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:17.570
he still gave them some help, because they were genuine persons who needed help.

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:24.129
Yes, although Jesus realized it wasn't yet the time to expand the work, he was willing to

00:13:24.129 --> 00:13:30.049
reach out to these ones as well. So what's the lesson for all of us?

00:13:31.009 --> 00:13:34.529
Well, when you go to your assignments, you will have a specific assignment.

00:13:35.409 --> 00:13:40.610
Now, if it's in a Bethel or in the field, you'll know what your assignment is.

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:46.129
So don't start looking at all the other assignments that are around and how you can help them and

00:13:46.129 --> 00:13:52.049
what you need to do and why don't they change? You've changed a lot in the last few months,

00:13:52.049 --> 00:13:56.529
but remember, they haven't. And they survive without you.

00:13:56.610 --> 00:14:04.610
So what's the key focus on your assignment?

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:10.370
Be zealous, be enthusiastic, but also be patient.

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:16.690
Yes, have trust in Jehovah that if you focus on your assignment, you work hard,

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:21.649
you take out whatever opportunities come your way along the way, then you can be sure you will

00:14:21.809 --> 00:14:26.049
be blessed because you're enthusiastic, but also patient.

00:14:27.409 --> 00:14:37.340
Well, now with those thoughts in mind, you have a very interesting program ahead of us.

00:14:38.299 --> 00:14:41.980
First up, we have Brother Kenneth Cook, a member of the governing body,

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:48.620
and Brother Cook is going to talk to you on the theme, follow the steps that lead to blessings.

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:59.149
Brother Cook, please. To begin, I'd like to share a personal experience with you.

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:04.990
When I was told that I was appointed to be a member of the governing body,

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:10.509
one of the brothers who informed me said, with this assignment,

00:15:10.509 --> 00:15:13.549
you'll experience a great increase in responsibility,

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:19.710
but you'll also see a corresponding increase in Jehovah's spirit to help you.

00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:22.029
It will not be too much for you.

00:15:22.909 --> 00:15:27.950
Well, those words were very, very reassuring to me.

00:15:28.909 --> 00:15:34.669
And the fact is that all of us, no matter who we are serving Jehovah faithfully,

00:15:34.669 --> 00:15:38.990
we must rely on his help to succeed in serving him.

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:42.350
Now, how do we show this and receive his help?

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:47.549
There are a number of ways we're going to focus on three of them.

00:15:47.549 --> 00:15:53.710
They are follow direction, show faith, and use common sense,

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:57.549
or the thinking ability that Jehovah has given to us.

00:15:57.549 --> 00:15:59.070
So let's consider the first step.

00:16:00.669 --> 00:16:06.750
Sometimes, all that's required to receive Jehovah's blessing on our work is to follow a simple,

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:12.750
clear direction. Now, here's a Bible example of that. It's found in Mark chapter 14.

00:16:13.149 --> 00:16:21.070
Mark chapter 14. Now, you'll recall from this account that God's son directed two of his disciples

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:27.230
to go into Jerusalem and to prepare a large furnished upper room for the Passover.

00:16:28.269 --> 00:16:34.590
His directions were specific. For instance, Jesus said that they would meet a man carrying a large

00:16:35.309 --> 00:16:42.029
earthenware jar, and they were to follow him. And then starting in verse 14, Jesus added this,

00:16:43.549 --> 00:16:49.389
he said, wherever he goes inside, say to the master of the house, the teacher says,

00:16:49.389 --> 00:16:53.070
where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:58.509
And he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready prepared for us there.

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:04.109
So the disciples went out, and they entered the city and found it just as he said to

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:12.829
them, and they prepared for the Passover. So the directions were simple, right? They were told

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:18.670
where they should go, who they should follow, what they were to say, and what they were to do.

00:17:19.549 --> 00:17:24.670
And the two disciples promptly followed that direction. And of course, their obedience

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:30.829
brought many blessings, as we know. Well, what practical lesson can you draw from this?

00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:37.150
The lesson that sometimes all that is needed in serving Jehovah is to follow simple clear

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:44.589
direction. You'll have many opportunities to do so in your assignments. Follow clear direction,

00:17:44.589 --> 00:17:51.069
and look for Jehovah's blessing on it. But now in the other hand, you might be asked to care for

00:17:51.069 --> 00:17:57.950
something that's far more involved than that. For example, what if you're asked to assist someone

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:06.269
who's known to be difficult to deal with? Or you're asked to care for a work-related problem

00:18:06.269 --> 00:18:13.390
that others have not been able to solve? You're the one selected because you've had the training.

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:20.990
In such a case, what will help you? Your strong faith. The next step. The fact is that at times we

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:26.750
need to show added faith to fulfill our assignments. True? Consider the example of Ananias. Now,

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:32.750
he too was a man of faith, but he faced a challenge that required even more of him, and we read about

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:41.309
it in Acts chapter 9. We'll begin with verse 10. Acts chapter 9 verse 10. It says, there was a disciple

00:18:41.309 --> 00:18:48.029
named Ananias and Damascus, and the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias. He said, here I am, Lord.

00:18:48.829 --> 00:18:54.750
The Lord said to him, get up, go to the street, call straight, and look for a man named Saul from

00:18:54.750 --> 00:19:02.029
Tarsus at the house of Judas. For look, he is praying. And in a vision, he has seen a man named

00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:08.190
Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he may recover sight. But Ananias answered, Lord,

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:16.029
I've heard about many about this man, about all the harm he did to your holy ones in Jerusalem.

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:21.789
And here he has authority from the chief priest to arrest all those calling on your name.

00:19:22.589 --> 00:19:28.910
But the Lord said to him, go, because this man is a chosen vessel to me to bear my name to the

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:35.950
nations, as well as to kings and the sons of Israel. For I will show him plainly how many things

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:44.190
he must suffer for my name. Well, the direction was clear. Where should Ananias go to the street

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:51.230
called straight? Who was he looking for? A man named Saul. What house is he in? The house of Judas.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:59.549
Ananias was even told what Saul was doing. He is praying. Then Ananias was told what he should do.

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:05.390
He was to lay his hands on him so that he would recover sight. Simple, right?

00:20:06.109 --> 00:20:14.109
Jesus would do the rest. What a great example of giving clear direction. But here is where Ananias

00:20:14.109 --> 00:20:19.950
needed to stir up more faith. The man he was to visit had severely persecuted the holy ones in

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:26.190
Jerusalem. And speaking to the Lord, Ananias added that this man quote has authority from the chief

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:33.549
priest to arrest all those calling on your name. We'll talk about stating the obvious to Jesus.

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:40.349
The point is that Ananias had a moment where he was overwhelmed by the way to the assignment.

00:20:40.349 --> 00:20:46.910
That's just what happened. What would help him? More faith. And Jesus knew how to draw it up in

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:54.750
that dear man. Look again at Jesus reply. He simply restated his command, go. Then Jesus said that

00:20:54.750 --> 00:21:01.309
this man is a chosen vessel to me to bear my name to the nations as well as to kings and the

00:21:01.309 --> 00:21:09.630
sons of Israel. Now Jesus added something there, didn't he? He pointed to the future. What was he

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:18.430
doing? He was helping Ananias to look ahead. See, and doing this evidently prompted Ananias to show

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:23.950
even more faith, which is what he needed. How do we know this? Well, look at what he said to Saul.

00:21:24.589 --> 00:21:32.190
On meeting Saul, in verse 17 tells us that Ananias called him brother. His initial hesitation had

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:39.230
changed into putting his full faith and trust in Jesus direction. Well, like Ananias says,

00:21:39.309 --> 00:21:43.710
you face challenges in the future and they will come. They come upon all of us.

00:21:44.589 --> 00:21:51.789
Have strong faith that Jehovah sees what is needed and he and his dear son will help you. Keep

00:21:51.789 --> 00:21:58.910
the big picture in mind and look to the blessings ahead for your hard work. Jehovah will always

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:05.230
bless your strong faith in him. Well, so far we've looked at the need to follow clear direction

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:12.670
and to show strong faith. Now we're going to add another step. Use common sense or thinking ability.

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:21.309
Our Bible example, Elijah. In this account, Elijah has traveled to Zaratheth, a Phoenician coastal town.

00:22:22.109 --> 00:22:28.109
What was his business there? Well, the lamb was in the grip of a long drought and Jehovah would

00:22:28.109 --> 00:22:35.470
help his prophet by means of someone in that town. Elijah was told, look, I will command a widow

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:42.190
there to supply you with food. It appears that he gave no other details about the widow than that.

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:48.829
So how would Elijah find her? Would Elijah look for the wealthiest widow to care for his needs?

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:55.549
Or would he use common sense and thinking ability along with his faith? Let's see what Elijah does

00:22:55.630 --> 00:23:03.309
at first King's chapter 17 and we're going to read verse 10. First King's 1710, it says,

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:10.029
so he Elijah rose up and went to Zaratheth when he came to the entrance of the city.

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:16.990
There was a widow gathering pieces of wood. So he called to her and said, please bring me a

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:23.470
little water and a cup so that I may drink. So then what did Elijah do?

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:31.710
Evidently, he approached the very first widow he met and she was not a wealthy widow but a poor one.

00:23:32.589 --> 00:23:37.230
In fact, it says Elijah had not yet passed beyond the entrance of the city.

00:23:38.109 --> 00:23:44.750
What does this tell us about Elijah? First, he showed no prejudice and following through

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:52.829
on Jehovah's direction, did he? And second, he added thinking ability to his obedience and faith.

00:23:52.829 --> 00:23:59.549
How so? Well, common sense would tell him to show his faith and start looking with the very first

00:23:59.549 --> 00:24:08.750
widow he met. Elijah obviously had confidence that Jehovah would make his choice clear. His obedience

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:15.150
faith and good sense were rewarded because that widow was Jehovah's choice. Now, surely Holy

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:22.829
Spirit guided Elijah but we can't ignore the faith and clear thinking ability that Elijah developed

00:24:22.829 --> 00:24:29.470
as he obediently did God's will after all prior to that widow, Jehovah used birds to carry food

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:36.349
to his prophet. Surely, Jehovah could use a poor widow as well. What's the lesson for you and for

00:24:36.349 --> 00:24:43.789
all of us? Sometimes we're given much to go on when we receive an assignment. At other times,

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:52.109
frankly, maybe not so much. In such a case, our faith and clear thinking ability reminds us to trust

00:24:52.109 --> 00:25:00.349
in Jehovah and to look for his guidance as we go forward in doing his will. Jehovah will always

00:25:00.349 --> 00:25:08.269
help you dear friends at the right time. So then as our example show promptly obey, show strong faith

00:25:08.269 --> 00:25:15.390
and use common sense and thinking ability in our service to our dear Heavenly Father. Remembering

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:21.230
such lessons will help you as you support Jehovah's work in your respective branches.

00:25:22.269 --> 00:25:29.630
Jehovah gives power beyond what is normal to those who rely on him and who follow the steps that

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:34.589
lead to blessings. And we are confident that this will always be true of you.

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:51.500
Thank you very much Brother Crook. We hope to see the steps that are needed for us to gain blessings.

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:56.859
Well, now our next speaker on the program is Brother Jeffrey Winder who is a

00:25:56.859 --> 00:26:01.900
Hopet to the Personnel Committee and Brother Winder is going to discuss with us this very

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:10.740
interesting question. How close can you be? How would you students answer this question?

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:18.180
Do you feel closer to Jehovah now than you did before your Gilead training began?

00:26:20.099 --> 00:26:27.140
The answer is a resounding yes, isn't it? Maybe you can relate to these comments of

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:36.019
graduates of past classes of Gilead. One brother said, absolutely yes. I believe I now experience

00:26:36.019 --> 00:26:42.819
more fully what it means to walk with God and know and rely upon him as a close friend.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:51.140
Not merely someone I turn and look up to in prayer. As Sister said, Gilead definitely drew me

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:58.420
closer to Jehovah. The way we study the scriptures with intensity truly made me feel like the Bible

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:07.619
was a letter Jehovah wrote to me. Another brother said, Jehovah communicated with such clarity

00:27:07.619 --> 00:27:15.700
which made it real and personal. It made me feel closer to Jehovah than ever before and that

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:23.650
feeling will never be forgotten. Well, unquestionably your deep study of God's word during Gilead

00:27:24.049 --> 00:27:33.809
drew you closer to Jehovah. But here's the question. How close can you be? How close can your

00:27:33.809 --> 00:27:39.970
relationship with Jehovah get? You saw it leap forward in five months of deep Bible study but

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:46.930
is there a limit? Is there more will you ever get done? Consider two points that answer that question.

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:55.200
The first one is found in the book of James chapter four. And let's read together the first part

00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:02.880
of verse eight. And let's read it with that question in mind. Is there any limit to how close

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:13.119
our relationship with Jehovah could be? James four eight says draw close to God and he will draw

00:28:13.119 --> 00:28:22.880
close to you. So is there any limit indicated here? Well, it is true that in English this phrase

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:28.480
to draw close to someone could be applied in a physical sense actually standing next to someone.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:33.680
And in that case, there is a limit. You can only stand so close to someone. But that's not really

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:40.079
the sense of James four eight, isn't it? Rather, it's in this sense. When we talk about our close

00:28:40.079 --> 00:28:46.000
friends, we're not talking about those that are nearest in proximity. We're talking about the

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.640
depth of our relationship, the closeness of our friendship. And so then to draw close to God then

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:59.200
means to strengthen our relationship, strengthen our friendship with him. And then looking at the verse,

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:05.359
does it appear that there's any limit to how close that relationship can get? The implication is

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:10.640
as long as we keep drawing close to Jehovah, then he'll keep drawing close to us.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:18.400
And that takes us to our second point. And that is the real life example of God's Son.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:27.039
Because Jesus drew close to Jehovah clearly. He was taught by Jehovah. Remember Isaiah 54 regarding

00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:33.200
Jesus' pre-human existence where he said, he awakens me morning by morning. He awakens my

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:40.319
ear to listen like the top ones. Does that sound a bit like your Gilead training? Morning,

00:29:40.319 --> 00:29:48.000
by morning. Jehovah was awakening your ear. Yet Jesus wasn't instructed by Jehovah for five months.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:57.359
He was instructed for billions of years. And during all that time, his relationship with his father

00:29:57.359 --> 00:30:05.329
continued to grow and deepen. So then we put it all together. You saw your relationship with

00:30:05.329 --> 00:30:12.609
Jehovah grow significantly in five months of deep Bible study. James 4.8 encourages us to just

00:30:12.609 --> 00:30:18.769
keep drawing close to Jehovah. And Jesus did so for billions of years and look at how close his

00:30:18.769 --> 00:30:29.599
relationship with Jehovah is. So then what's the answer? How close can you be to Jehovah? The potential

00:30:30.079 --> 00:30:38.930
for your relationship with Jehovah to deepen is endless. Well, that's just wonderful to contemplate,

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:44.690
isn't it? But let's make some application because this really becomes a very important overall

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:51.009
lesson that you take with you from your Gilead experience. That is how your deep Bible study

00:30:51.009 --> 00:30:57.009
affected your relationship with Jehovah. And one of the reasons why this is such an important lesson

00:30:57.089 --> 00:31:04.289
is because your success in your assignment is directly connected to the depth of your relationship

00:31:04.289 --> 00:31:11.490
with Jehovah. Your success in your assignment is directly connected to the depth of your

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:19.329
relationship with Jehovah. Now, why can we say that? It's because of what takes place when we draw

00:31:19.329 --> 00:31:24.130
close to Jehovah through a study of his word. In turn, with me, please, to the book of Psalms.

00:31:25.009 --> 00:31:38.299
And we'll read the 25th Psalm in verse 4. Psalm 254. It says,

00:31:38.299 --> 00:31:48.539
make me know your ways, O Jehovah. Teach me your paths. This is what's happening when we study

00:31:48.539 --> 00:31:54.380
God's word, isn't it? We are coming to know Jehovah God's ways. The watchtower once said it this way.

00:31:55.019 --> 00:32:00.539
It said, as we get a deeper and deeper understanding of God's word, we become

00:32:00.539 --> 00:32:09.339
imbued with God's way of thinking. We become imbued with God's way of thinking. The dictionary

00:32:09.339 --> 00:32:17.819
said that the word imbu implies the introduction of a quality that fills and permeates the whole

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:26.380
being. So like dying a garment or leavening bread. But here, we're talking about being imbued with

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:33.660
God's thinking that maybe God's thinking would fill and permeate our whole being. Is that possible?

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:41.579
Think back to the example of Jesus. As we discuss, Jesus drew close to Jehovah. He was taught by

00:32:41.579 --> 00:32:49.180
Jehovah for billions of years and what was happening during that whole time. He was being imbued

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:56.859
with Jehovah God's thinking. And it so permeated him that when he was on earth, he could say it, John 14

00:32:56.859 --> 00:33:04.940
9, whoever has seen me has seen the Father also. So in other words, everything that Jesus said,

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:11.740
everything that he did while on earth in every situation, well, we could imagine Jehovah doing

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:21.420
and saying those very things. And that is why the success of your assignment is directly connected

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:28.460
to the depth of your relationship with Jehovah. The more you draw close to Jehovah through a study of

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:35.819
his word, the more you are imbued with his thinking and the more than you will do and act and say

00:33:35.819 --> 00:33:44.940
things as Jehovah would. And so how does this play out? Well, in your assignment, if you have the

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:51.579
privilege to contribute to significant decisions that will affect others in your department or at the

00:33:51.579 --> 00:33:58.220
branch or in the field, even. Well, you want to be guided by a Jehovah's thinking, don't you?

00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:04.220
You want to do things as he would do them. Well, the closer you are to Jehovah, the deeper that

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:13.630
relationship is, the more your decisions will mirror his. But of course, we know strengthening

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:18.510
and stabilizing others isn't always done in big grand gestures like that. Big decisions, new

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:25.150
organizational arrangements, quite often is the day-to-day interactions with others that really

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:31.150
encourages them. And isn't it true? We learn so much from those intimate conversations that Jesus

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:38.429
had with others or seemingly incidental interactions that he had with others that the Bible records.

00:34:39.309 --> 00:34:47.230
Well, you will strengthen others in similar ways. For example, when you are guided by Jehovah's

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:53.869
thinking in personal matters, such as in your choice of dress and grooming, well, others will

00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:59.469
certainly notice that and that will strengthen their resolve to make good decisions in these personal

00:34:59.469 --> 00:35:07.389
areas. When you are guided by Jehovah's thinking in the use of your time, as busy as you will be

00:35:07.389 --> 00:35:12.030
when the friends see you in the ministry at the meetings, working hard in your assignment,

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:17.550
they will take notice of that and that will strengthen their resolve to make good priorities

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:24.030
in their life. Every time you steer a negative conversation to the positive, every time you show

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:30.190
a willingness to do humble tasks, every time you take the time to get the other side of the story

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:36.349
before rendering judgment. It's in all these areas of your daily life, you give evidence that you

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:43.389
have drawn close to Jehovah, you have been imbued with his thinking and you are acting as Jehovah's

00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:55.969
and in that case, you absolutely will strengthen and stabilize your brothers. Well, we love you

00:35:55.969 --> 00:36:03.250
for your relationship with Jehovah and we encourage you to take this lesson of Gilead with you,

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:09.170
the effect that your deep Bible study had on your relationship with Jehovah and keep

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:15.409
drawing close to him. The potential is endless and this is what will ensure your success.

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:24.050
Well, may the rich blessing of Jehovah, your friend, be with you as you use your Gilead training

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:35.500
in the assignments he has given you. But I'm sure we'll all agree that was a beautiful

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:42.300
answer to the question, how close can you be in? All of us feel close to Jehovah, but what a

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:48.940
wonderful encouragement for us to draw ever closer to him. The next brother who's going to give you

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:57.260
some words of encouragement has a very intriguing theme, buy a field in Anathoth, a brother gauge

00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:05.820
legal whose helper to the service committee is going to develop this theme buy a field in Anathoth.

00:37:08.269 --> 00:37:16.829
The year was 608 BCE. The Prophet Jeremiah had already served nearly 40 years faithfully.

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:23.869
And now he was confined in the courtyard of the guard in Jerusalem. Jerusalem's walls were being

00:37:23.869 --> 00:37:30.989
battered by the Babylonians. In less than a year, the entire city would be completely destroyed.

00:37:31.949 --> 00:37:35.869
But Jeremiah had to weather this storm. There was no way out. There was no place for him to go. He

00:37:35.869 --> 00:37:43.920
was under lockdown. Well, have you ever felt like Jeremiah as if the world was caving in on you?

00:37:45.679 --> 00:37:52.079
Maybe it was a serious health scare. The health of a loved one. The death of a loved one.

00:37:54.820 --> 00:38:01.139
Maybe COVID-19 has made you feel boxed in. Some of our brothers just like Jeremiah have faced

00:38:01.139 --> 00:38:06.579
persecution or imprisonment. And that might be our lot before the end of the system of things.

00:38:07.139 --> 00:38:13.780
Well, what will help you students? In fact, all of us during these critical last days when we

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:18.900
face personal trials or adversity, I invite you to open to Jeremiah chapter 32.

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:23.860
Let's consider a dramatic illustration in the life of Jeremiah.

00:38:24.659 --> 00:38:30.900
Now, Jeremiah is under lockdown. Jeremiah 32, let's read verses 6 through 8.

00:38:33.059 --> 00:38:37.380
Jeremiah said, the word of Jehovah has come to me saying,

00:38:38.179 --> 00:38:41.539
here, Hannah Mel, the son of Shalom, your uncle will come to you and say,

00:38:42.179 --> 00:38:46.980
a buy for yourself, my field and anothoth, because you have the first right to repurchase it.

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:52.420
Verse 8, Hannah Mel, the son of my uncle came to me just as Jehovah had said,

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:55.059
into the courtyard of the guard, and he said to me,

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:59.780
please buy my field and anothoth, in the land of Benjamin, for you have the right to take

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:06.019
possession of it and to repurchase it. Buy it for yourself. At that, I knew that this was by the

00:39:06.019 --> 00:39:15.699
word of Jehovah. What was Jehovah's instruction to Jeremiah? Buy a field. Buy a field. Right now,

00:39:15.699 --> 00:39:21.619
with the Babylonians beating on the door, Jeremiah might have thought, I need an escape plan,

00:39:21.619 --> 00:39:29.940
not a field, of all places, anothoth. Where was anoth? Well, Jeremiah knew exactly where it was,

00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:36.659
just a few miles north northeast of Jerusalem. He was born there into a priestly family. Did he

00:39:36.659 --> 00:39:44.099
have pleasant memories of his past and anothoth as a youth? Very likely. But now that was a distant

00:39:44.099 --> 00:39:50.659
memory. More recently, men of anoth, possibly some of Jeremiah's own relatives, threatened to kill

00:39:50.659 --> 00:39:58.260
him because of his prophesy. Well, did Jeremiah obey in spite of any personal feelings he might have

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:06.420
had? Jeremiah always obeyed, even previously, when Jehovah told him not to take a wife or to have

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:13.699
children. Well, what did he do in this situation? Verses 9 and 10. So I bought the field and anothoth

00:40:13.699 --> 00:40:18.980
from Panama, the son of my uncle. I weighed out the money to him, seven shekels and 10 silver

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:25.219
pieces. Then I recorded it in a deed, affixed the seal, called in witnesses, and weighed the money

00:40:25.219 --> 00:40:33.780
in the scales. Jeremiah could have worked in the legal department. Well, he carried out the legal

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:39.699
transaction, the legal requirements of the transaction. He recorded the transaction in two deeds,

00:40:39.699 --> 00:40:44.820
one sealed, one unsealed, complete transparency in this situation.

00:40:46.099 --> 00:40:49.300
Why did Jehovah ask Jeremiah to buy a field and anothoth?

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:56.820
Jeremiah already had complete faith that yes, Jehovah's word would be restored. When 70 years had

00:40:56.820 --> 00:41:03.219
transpired, the Jews would return to their homeland. But now, Jehovah reinforced Jeremiah's faith

00:41:03.219 --> 00:41:08.659
by giving something specific to think about. Jeremiah could imagine the time when buying and

00:41:08.659 --> 00:41:17.300
selling would again occur in Israel. Well, was Jeremiah's faith well placed in Jehovah's promise?

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:25.860
Absolutely. Ezra, later documented that 128 men of anothoth were among the first group of those

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:36.099
returning from Babylonian exile. Jehovah's word always comes true. Well, how might we,

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:43.539
how might you buy a field and anothoth? Well, we're not expecting you to go out and purchase

00:41:44.179 --> 00:41:50.420
a piece of property and a place called anothoth. No, we find a clue, though, in Hebrews chapter 11.

00:41:51.380 --> 00:42:00.050
Hebrews chapter 11, verse 1, faith is the assured expectation of what is hoped for.

00:42:00.849 --> 00:42:08.510
The evident demonstration of realities that are not seen, the simple English Bible renders this

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:17.389
faith is the title deed to the things that we hope for. And on most of us in special full-time

00:42:17.389 --> 00:42:23.630
service, we don't own property. But we may have the title to a car. What does that mean? That means

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:31.710
that that car that vehicle belongs to us personally. Our faith is the title deed of good things to come.

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:38.750
A guarantee of future realities. Jeremiah had a title deed. We have a title deed of faith.

00:42:39.869 --> 00:42:46.030
So how do we buy a field and anothoth? It's not a type, anti-type situation. It's just an illustration.

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:53.230
In the context of our discussion, it means we exercise faith in Jehovah's promises.

00:42:54.349 --> 00:43:00.269
When facing a trial, we can search Jehovah's word for promises regarding the future.

00:43:01.389 --> 00:43:06.909
And that gives us strength to keep on enduring. For example, if we're facing a serious illness,

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:14.750
God's word promises no resident will say, I am sick. If we're grieving the death of a loved one,

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:23.150
the Bible assures us there is going to be a resurrection. The trial doesn't disappear yet,

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:27.710
but exercising faith in Jehovah's promises helps us to endure.

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:34.349
Now there's something else that we can learn from that dramatic illustration in the life of Jeremiah.

00:43:34.429 --> 00:43:38.829
Back in Jeremiah 32, notice please, verses 13 through 15.

00:43:40.429 --> 00:43:45.550
Jeremiah was inspired to write. He said, I now commanded barrack in their presence saying,

00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:53.710
this is what Jehovah of Armies, the God of Israel says, take these deeds, this deed of purchase,

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:58.909
the sealed one, and the other deed left unsealed and put them into an earthenware vessel so that

00:43:58.909 --> 00:44:05.550
they may be kept for a long time. For this is what Jehovah of Armies, the God of Israel says,

00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:14.579
houses and fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land. Jeremiah involved barrack

00:44:14.579 --> 00:44:22.019
in the legal proceedings when he bought the field in Anathoth. Jeremiah's faith influenced barrack

00:44:22.659 --> 00:44:26.900
for the good. We can almost hear the confidence and conviction in his voice.

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:32.900
This is what Jehovah of Armies, the God of Israel says. Jeremiah used that expression,

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:38.420
Jehovah of Armies more than any other Bible writer. It was like Jeremiah said, our God will certainly

00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:43.380
overturn the Babylonians. These promises are real. You can take them to the bank. They're not

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:52.500
counterfeit. They're completely true. What's the lesson for us? Our faith can strengthen fellow

00:44:52.500 --> 00:45:00.500
believers. A sister named Joyce, while she herself was fighting cancer, she made what she called

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:07.699
shot in the arm cards. They were collections of Bible verses, pictures from our publications,

00:45:07.699 --> 00:45:12.260
quotes from theocratic songs, or watched our articles, and she would give them to those in need

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:21.380
of encouragement. One of her favorites was Psalm 112, 7 and 8. And there it says, he will not fear

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:27.380
bad news. His heart is steadfast, trusting in Jehovah. His heart is unshakable. He is not afraid.

00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:35.219
In the end, he will look and triumph on his adversaries. Sister Joyce had a lot of bad news in her life.

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:43.940
But her faith in Jehovah's promises was powerful. Sadly, Joyce lost her fight with cancer a few

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:52.820
years back, but she bought a field in Anathoth, and she will witness the fulfillment of Jehovah's promises.

00:45:54.019 --> 00:45:58.739
Even now, she's given us a shot in the arm, encouragement from Jehovah's word strengthened

00:45:58.739 --> 00:46:05.860
us with her faith. And so dear Gilead students, what have we learned? Faith is like a title deed

00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:12.980
of things hoped for. Faith in Jehovah's word helps us to endure trials and adversity. Our faith

00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:19.300
can have a power effect on those around us. So when faced with persecution, by a field in Anathoth,

00:46:20.739 --> 00:46:25.860
when faced with a grievous health problem, by a field in Anathoth, when grieving the loss of

00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:32.659
loved one, by a field in Anathoth, in some days soon, your faith will be rewarded. You'll walk

00:46:32.659 --> 00:46:47.070
in that field when Jehovah's word comes true. What a beautiful talk. Not to be honest, I don't know

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:53.710
if you're like me. When I heard the theme by a field in Anathoth, I'm like, where on earth is he going

00:46:53.710 --> 00:47:01.550
to take us? I mean, to be quite honest, then. Well, Brother Flegal, you took us to a very good spot

00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:06.190
with the title deed and seen the connection there. In fact, that's going to be a little

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:12.349
password we might say by a field in Anathoth. And if we say to someone and they looked amazed,

00:47:12.429 --> 00:47:20.110
we'll say, oh, you weren't there for the graduation program. Well, thank you very much.

00:47:20.989 --> 00:47:27.389
Now, for your dear students over the last few months, you've drawn very close to the instructors.

00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:34.510
And you've heard them day in, day out. You've learned and experienced a lot of things from them.

00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:40.110
So the next two parts, the opportunities are two of these instructors that give you a few

00:47:40.110 --> 00:47:46.030
final words of encouragement. So first of all, we're going to have Brother Trent Lipold,

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:52.510
who's going to talk to you. And he has this interesting question, distinguished by what?

00:47:55.230 --> 00:48:04.750
He was a mighty man. He fell the heroes of the enemy. He slayed a giant. He even killed a lion.

00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:12.110
And his name was not David. Who was he? Open your Bibles with me, please, to the book of First

00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:24.190
Chronicles, chapter 11. First Chronicles, chapter 11, and verse 22. Beniah, the son of Jehoyada was a

00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:32.269
courageous man who performed many exploits in Kabzeh. He struck down the two sons of Ariel of Moab,

00:48:32.989 --> 00:48:36.750
and he descended into a water pit on a snowy day and killed a lion.

00:48:38.429 --> 00:48:43.789
He also struck down an Egyptian man of extraordinary size, five qubits tall.

00:48:45.070 --> 00:48:49.550
Though the Egyptian had a spear in his hand like the beam of loom workers,

00:48:50.269 --> 00:48:54.989
he went against him with a rod and snatched the spear away from the Egyptian's hand and

00:48:54.989 --> 00:49:05.360
killed him with his own spear. He is Beniah. Look at all we learn about him in these verses.

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:14.719
The qualities that Beniah displayed. It tells us in verse 22, he was a courageous man. He

00:49:14.719 --> 00:49:24.719
performed many exploits in Kabzeh. Kabzeh. Kabzeh is a small place on the very southern border of Judah.

00:49:24.719 --> 00:49:33.519
It borders Eden, the middle of nowhere. But Beniah worked there. He was happy to be there.

00:49:33.519 --> 00:49:38.719
It may be that that was his home or it may be that that was his assignment. No matter

00:49:39.679 --> 00:49:46.480
as obscure a place as Kabzeh is, that's where he worked. And the record says he performed many

00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:57.809
exploits courageously in Kabzeh. He killed a lion, courage. But you notice he descended into a

00:49:57.809 --> 00:50:06.050
water pit and killed a lion. Courage descended into a water pit with a lion. There's only one coming

00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:13.969
out and it was Beniah. He descended into a water pit on a snowy day. He didn't wait for the sun

00:50:13.969 --> 00:50:21.090
to shine. He knew that was the day. Adverse conditions, no matter. Beniah went in and he slayed the

00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:27.969
lion. Look at verse 23, some more amazing qualities. He struck down the giant in Egyptian of

00:50:27.969 --> 00:50:33.010
extraordinary size. But notice that though the Egyptian had a spear in his hand like the beam of

00:50:33.010 --> 00:50:40.050
loom workers, he Beniah went against him with a rod, a rod, a stick. He didn't have the right

00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:50.449
equipment. Courage, adaptability, commitment. And notice this, what does he do? It says he went

00:50:50.449 --> 00:50:55.010
against him with a rod and snatched the spear away from the Egyptian's hand and killed him with

00:50:55.010 --> 00:51:05.460
his own spear. Courage, commitment, adaptability, resourcefulness, admirable, beneficial qualities.

00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:15.699
Are those the qualities that distinguished Beniah? Not entirely. There was one quality that

00:51:15.699 --> 00:51:24.420
exceeded these. And that quality was loyalty. Tenacious adherence to the person of Jehovah.

00:51:25.699 --> 00:51:35.300
That's what the Bible record reveals about Beniah. Personal loyalty to Jehovah. There is a caution

00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:44.860
though with loyalty. The demarcation between loyalty to Jehovah and loyalty to self

00:51:46.539 --> 00:51:59.230
can often be blurry. It hides under the inertia of imperfection and selfishness. That line of

00:51:59.230 --> 00:52:07.469
loyalty to Jehovah versus loyalty to self can become very difficult to see. In fact, loyalty to

00:52:07.469 --> 00:52:16.429
self can lie dormant within us until the circumstances arise and change and then it can emerge.

00:52:17.869 --> 00:52:25.869
And Beniah and his contemporaries provide for us a beautiful contrast in loyalty to Jehovah and

00:52:25.869 --> 00:52:34.980
loyalty to self. Think of Beniah. He lived in a very tumultuous time. David was a fugitive with his

00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:41.139
mighty men. One of them likely was Beniah and others. These men were comrades in arms running

00:52:41.139 --> 00:52:48.739
with David. They were a band of brothers. They were fiercely loyal to David and to be sure they

00:52:48.739 --> 00:52:55.699
were loyal to Jehovah as well. For example, among these three mighty men were three brothers,

00:52:55.699 --> 00:53:03.699
fleshly brothers. They're mentioned in verses 20 and 26. Jehovah, Abashai, and Azahel.

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:15.519
Now consider when circumstances changed for the mighty men. When Saul died and David now became

00:53:15.519 --> 00:53:25.599
king. In these changing circumstances, what happened to the mighty men? Here's the contrast. Jehovah

00:53:26.239 --> 00:53:34.480
and Beniah. What happened to Joab? Joab saw opportunity in changing circumstances.

00:53:35.519 --> 00:53:44.079
And his loyalty to Jehovah was eclipsed by his loyalty to himself. For instance,

00:53:45.199 --> 00:53:53.360
it was Joab who took matters into his own hands and he killed Abner with whom David had already

00:53:53.360 --> 00:54:03.679
concluded a covenant. He took matters into his own hands. Why? He wanted Abner's job. His selfish

00:54:03.679 --> 00:54:11.199
ambitions got the better of him and they eclipsed his loyalty to Jehovah. Joab was a courageous man.

00:54:11.199 --> 00:54:19.199
He was resourceful. He was adaptable, admirable qualities, but in the absence of deep personal

00:54:19.199 --> 00:54:27.199
loyalty to Jehovah, they seem somehow tainted, don't they? But consider Beniah in the same

00:54:27.199 --> 00:54:33.840
circumstances. Beniah had no part in these kind of intrigues like Joab and his brothers. Beniah

00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:41.280
was loyal to Jehovah and he was a loyal man to Jehovah's anointed one. David, and look at what we find

00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:49.039
in verses 24 and 25. Verses 24 and 25. These things, Beniah, the son of Jehoyah did

00:54:49.679 --> 00:54:55.039
and he had a reputation like that of the three mighty warriors. Although he was distinguished

00:54:55.039 --> 00:55:04.639
even more than the 30, he did not attain to the rank of the three. However, David appointed him

00:55:04.639 --> 00:55:15.599
over his own bodyguard. You see in the same circumstances as Joab, Beniah's tenacious adherence

00:55:15.599 --> 00:55:23.280
to Jehovah, his deep personal loyalty to Jehovah, safeguarded him in these circumstances. What did David

00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:33.280
see in Beniah? David saw in Beniah what he himself exemplified and that was deep and strong personal

00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:39.039
loyalty to Jehovah. You can see that in this verse in verse 25, can't you? It says, however,

00:55:39.039 --> 00:55:47.519
David appointed him over his own bodyguard. David knew to assign someone to this very, very trusted

00:55:47.519 --> 00:55:55.679
position, head of his own bodyguard. The man in that position, if he was loyal to Jehovah,

00:55:55.679 --> 00:56:03.409
he would be loyal to him and that's what David saw in Beniah. Then came another time of change,

00:56:03.409 --> 00:56:12.530
decades later, when David died and Solomon became king, changed to circumstances another time

00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:22.769
of opportunity. How would Beniah react? The same way he always did, deep personal loyalty to Jehovah

00:56:23.730 --> 00:56:32.369
and it was Solomon when he became king who rewarded Beniah. The son of David, Solomon,

00:56:32.369 --> 00:56:40.050
Jehovah's anointed, rewarded Beniah for his loyalty. Turn with me, please, to Proverbs 19, verse 22.

00:56:41.250 --> 00:56:48.690
You see Solomon knew something about loyalty. He was the son of David and look at what he

00:56:48.690 --> 00:56:54.929
wrote about loyalty in Proverbs 19, verse 22. Solomon said, the desirable thing in man

00:56:55.489 --> 00:57:07.809
is his loyal love, his loyalty. That's what Jehovah looks for in us. So Beniah, he was indeed a mighty man

00:57:07.809 --> 00:57:18.130
and he had beautiful qualities. Did they distinguish him? Not entirely. It was his deep personal

00:57:18.369 --> 00:57:25.409
loyalty to Jehovah first and foremost that distinguished him. And because of that deep personal loyalty

00:57:25.409 --> 00:57:35.329
to Jehovah, those qualities of Beniahs, they were beautiful. So daily cultivate your loyalty to God

00:57:36.050 --> 00:57:43.650
through prayer and study. That's been your training here. Use your training to develop your

00:57:43.650 --> 00:57:50.849
close personal loyalty to Jehovah. That's what Beniah did. Think of Beniah's training. He was the

00:57:50.849 --> 00:57:59.489
son of Jehojada. Jehojada was one of the chief Levitical priests in Israel. Beniah was raised with

00:57:59.489 --> 00:58:09.170
scrolls, not with swords, growing up the son of a priest that was his training. So like Beniah,

00:58:09.969 --> 00:58:17.730
be willing to do the work without the rank. Remember loyalty is tested not when you are at ease,

00:58:18.849 --> 00:58:24.369
loyalty is tested under adversity. So be careful in changing circumstances.

00:58:25.329 --> 00:58:31.780
Guard your hearts. Dear students, you all have beautiful qualities. We've seen them over the

00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:39.619
last five months. But may loyalty, may your deep personal loyalty to Jehovah,

00:58:40.579 --> 00:58:53.920
distinguished you. Thank you very much brotherly, Paul, for that. We all felt like we were students

00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:59.679
in the Gilead classroom, didn't we? And certainly you helped us to see the importance of loyalty.

00:59:00.559 --> 00:59:06.079
Well, the next instructor is also a helper to the teaching committee by the Mark de Mer,

00:59:06.079 --> 00:59:15.920
is going to give this stirring encouragement. March on with Jehovah. The young man he received his

00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:23.679
assignment and it was not for the faint of heart. He would have to tell the desolation of cherished

00:59:23.679 --> 00:59:30.880
cities, the burning of Jehovah's temple, the captivity of his people. And for delivering these

00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:40.159
messages, which they were not easy, he would endure scathing and murderous attempts on his life.

00:59:42.159 --> 00:59:52.110
Now on top of that, he would experience moments of discouragement, isolation, self-doubt.

00:59:53.309 --> 01:00:00.989
When receiving his assignment, this young man said, Jehovah, I cannot do this. I'm just a boy.

01:00:02.590 --> 01:00:14.639
The boy was from Anathoth. And his name was Jeremiah. But what would help him be successful with

01:00:14.639 --> 01:00:20.639
this assignment? It would be following and taking to heart the very points that brother

01:00:20.639 --> 01:00:28.800
Flegal brought out about faith. He would need deep abiding faith and trust in Jehovah. And in

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:39.280
addition to that, he would need to learn how to march. Jeremiah was ready to enter the front lines

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:49.199
of the battle, the battle to defend pure worship against those who hated. And like any good soldier,

01:00:49.199 --> 01:00:57.900
one of the first things you learn is how to march. Now marching is more challenging than mere walking.

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:09.820
Marching requires determination. It requires stamina, endurance, and to keep moving forward

01:01:10.539 --> 01:01:20.380
in a regular steady step. And as Jeremiah entered this battle, he would need to learn how to march.

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:28.500
What would help him? Recalling what was written in God's word, centuries before his time,

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:33.780
words recorded at Deuteronomy chapter 31 and verse 6. I want to read these words to you.

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:43.139
These words were so important to Jeremiah. The context was when Moses was encouraging confidence

01:01:43.139 --> 01:01:48.579
in Jehovah that the nation of Israel was ready to enter into the Promised Land. They would face

01:01:48.579 --> 01:01:56.900
enemies. They would face a fight, a battle. But look what Moses says in verse 6 of Deuteronomy 31.

01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:05.699
Be courageous and strong. Do not be afraid or struck with terror before them. For Jehovah,

01:02:05.699 --> 01:02:15.219
your God is the one marching with you. He's marching with you. He will neither desert or abandon you.

01:02:17.619 --> 01:02:21.059
So how did Jehovah march alongside this boy?

01:02:21.139 --> 01:02:30.739
At Jeremiah chapter 1 and verse 8, Jehovah tells Jeremiah, do not be afraid because of their appearance.

01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:39.619
For I am with you to save you. Don't be afraid. In other words, when a person marches with Jehovah,

01:02:41.139 --> 01:02:48.980
you see Jehovah marches with him, boosting him along, making him strong. It's as if Jehovah told

01:02:49.059 --> 01:02:58.110
Jeremiah, don't worry. You just come and march with me. And for the next 67 years, that's exactly what

01:02:58.110 --> 01:03:03.949
Jeremiah did. In Jehovah's strength, think about what happened. In Jehovah's strength,

01:03:05.309 --> 01:03:11.389
Jeremiah preached to hard-hearted people, including wicked kings, corrupt priests, apostates. He did

01:03:11.389 --> 01:03:22.000
it. And as he marched, he saw Jehovah march with him. He was conscious of that fact. Jehovah saved

01:03:22.719 --> 01:03:29.039
him when imprisoned in a dungeon. Jehovah supplied him a daily ration of food during a famine.

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:37.599
Jehovah rescued him from a sister. You see, this is real. This was tangible. This was concrete.

01:03:37.599 --> 01:03:44.000
It wasn't made up. Jehovah was marching with him. And as Jeremiah saw Jehovah's support,

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:50.719
it strengthened him. It gave him more confidence. And Jehovah marched with him. And then,

01:03:50.719 --> 01:03:59.199
Jeremiah was ready then for the next trial. And why do we bring this up? Because your situation is

01:03:59.199 --> 01:04:07.760
very similar to Jeremiah's household, along with your Gilead training. You are being put on the

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:14.559
front lines. You're going to be asked to defend pure worship, maybe like you never have before.

01:04:14.559 --> 01:04:24.880
So we want you to stay in the battle. We want you to keep marching. For example, what if in your

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:32.239
assignment, opposition turns into outright persecution? Or what if in your branch territory,

01:04:32.239 --> 01:04:44.239
you face a political upheaval or war? What if you need to risk your lives to provide relief?

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:49.840
Like our brothers in, in and around Ukraine are doing. What if that happens?

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:58.079
Your brothers will be looking to you as an example. Will you be able to set that example? Can

01:04:58.079 --> 01:05:07.099
you maintain that example? Yes, you can. Because when you march with Jehovah, now listen carefully.

01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:15.739
When you march with Jehovah, he does something very special for you in moments of weakness.

01:05:16.539 --> 01:05:24.380
We'll consider what happened to Jeremiah. At one point it got so bad he wanted to quit. I'm quitting.

01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:29.340
Jeremiah, chapter 20, verse 9. I'm not going to mention Jehovah's name. I'm not going to talk about

01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:36.860
it anymore. I'm discouraged. I'm tired. I'm exhausted. I'm going to stop marching. He was losing

01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:44.300
his focus. So how does Jehovah help him? What did Jehovah do? Did he say, well, Jeremiah, that's it.

01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:50.699
If you're going to be exhausted, I'll find another prophet. No. Jehovah did not do that.

01:05:50.699 --> 01:05:55.980
What did Jehovah do? And this is a thought we want you to take to heart. Jeremiah, chapter 20

01:05:58.260 --> 01:06:06.690
and verse 11. How does Jehovah help him to keep marching? But Jehovah was with me

01:06:07.329 --> 01:06:18.289
like a what friend? Like a brother? No, no, no, like a fearsome warrior. So in what way did

01:06:18.289 --> 01:06:24.929
Jehovah prove to be a fearsome warrior, a mighty soldier standing right at Jeremiah's side?

01:06:27.090 --> 01:06:34.849
How did Jehovah do that? Well, what happens in battle? When a soldier sees a fellow soldiers

01:06:34.849 --> 01:06:40.210
stumble and fall? What does he do? He rushes to his side. He supports him. He grabs him. They

01:06:40.210 --> 01:06:45.889
go together, wraps his arm around him and they move to safety together. This is what Jehovah did

01:06:45.889 --> 01:06:55.460
for Jeremiah. In fact, Jeremiah tells us this in chapter 20 and in verse 7. What does Jeremiah say?

01:06:55.460 --> 01:07:04.420
He experienced this. He says, You used your strength against me and you prevail.

01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:13.760
You used your strength against me. What does that mean? Jehovah used his strength against Jeremiah's

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:22.639
weakness. Seeing Jehovah do this for him time and again, time and again, enabled Jeremiah to accomplish

01:07:22.639 --> 01:07:29.119
what he could have never accomplished on his own. This is the point we're making for you and all

01:07:29.119 --> 01:07:37.039
of these experience, strength, and it transformed his natural shyness, his feelings of inadequacy,

01:07:37.039 --> 01:07:44.079
his lack of confidence into iron-like boldness. Jehovah was with him like a fearsome warrior.

01:07:44.079 --> 01:07:50.639
Jehovah loved the commission he gave Jeremiah. He was working with Jeremiah to fulfill this commission.

01:07:50.719 --> 01:07:56.880
It was precious to Jehovah, just like your commission. It's precious to Jehovah.

01:07:59.010 --> 01:08:03.730
So you can be assured that Jehovah is going to do the same for you. We want you to have that

01:08:03.730 --> 01:08:14.210
confidence. In fact, one sister who not long ago graduated from Gilead experienced this first hand.

01:08:14.369 --> 01:08:23.170
Shortly after arriving in her assignment, she was arrested. Our sister was held captive in a

01:08:23.170 --> 01:08:30.770
dungeon-like prison. And during that time, she was given meager rations of food and was subjected

01:08:30.770 --> 01:08:37.729
to painful, prolonged punishment. How was she able to endure? How could she stay strong? How?

01:08:38.529 --> 01:08:44.930
By marching with Jehovah. And she never lost sight of the fact that she was part of an army

01:08:44.930 --> 01:08:50.449
of marchers. She was marching with the fearsome warrior. In fact, this is what she said,

01:08:53.310 --> 01:09:00.510
thinking about my Gilead classmates. And visualizing their faces gave me power.

01:09:01.949 --> 01:09:08.909
I kept their smiling faces in front of me. I imagine where each classmate sat, each row from

01:09:08.909 --> 01:09:16.029
left to right, front to back. I recalled where they were from. What work they did in their assignments?

01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:24.270
This made the time go by quickly and I felt no physical pain at all. I sang in my head,

01:09:24.270 --> 01:09:32.270
kingdom songs. The song I sang the most was Jehovah's Your Name. Another song that touched my

01:09:32.270 --> 01:09:40.510
heart deeply was song number 38. He will make you strong. I made that song more personal

01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:51.859
by replacing the pronoun you with me. This song helped me never to give up. I had no Bible.

01:09:52.899 --> 01:09:58.100
So each day I meditated on Bible teachings such as everlasting life and paradise and a resurrection

01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:05.939
hope. These meditations gave me deep inner joy and a calm that cannot be described.

01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:14.899
At times I thought about the possibility of facing death, but the fear of death did not consume me.

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:25.020
Yes, she thought about the possibility of facing death, but the fear of death did not consume me.

01:10:25.579 --> 01:10:32.939
The fear some warrior Jehovah was marching with her, no prison walls, no bars can block Jehovah from

01:10:32.939 --> 01:10:43.840
marching with her and our sister was recently released from prison. So whatever your trials,

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:51.039
we don't know what trials you're going to face, you don't know, we don't know, but reflect on how

01:10:51.039 --> 01:10:56.880
Jehovah supports you. Stay in the battle. And when you reflect on Jehovah, how Jehovah supports you,

01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:02.640
it's tangible, it's real, it's concrete. Think about that. Jehovah will never stop marching with you.

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:12.159
And remember, you are a part of a large army. You're not alone. Therefore, when you see a fellow

01:11:12.159 --> 01:11:21.439
worshipper struggling, don't ignore them. Help them not to fall behind. Help them. Help them. You're

01:11:21.439 --> 01:11:29.199
part of an army. You've been trained to do this. That's what school taught you. Not to be independent,

01:11:29.199 --> 01:11:36.000
but to be interdependent, not independent, interdependent with your brothers and sisters. That's your

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:45.119
job. Be quick to help them back up. Keep marching with Jehovah. And although you don't know what

01:11:45.119 --> 01:11:55.600
challenges lie ahead, you are prepared. So with your marching orders in hand, be courageous and strong,

01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:02.479
knowing that each trial you face, each trial you endure will make you stronger for the next one.

01:12:04.239 --> 01:12:11.920
Be confident. You'll always have the fearsome warrior, the mighty soldier marching by your side.

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:23.600
He's there, Jehovah. So now go. Wherever the battle may take you, go. And be determined to fulfill

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:42.859
your commission to support your brothers, as you march on with Jehovah. What a powerful encouragement,

01:12:42.859 --> 01:12:49.420
one that I'm sure you remember for many years to come. And students, maybe I need to apologize,

01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:55.899
I didn't realize Anathoth was going to be the buzzword. You see, if I'd realized that in the

01:12:55.899 --> 01:13:00.539
beginning, my introduction, I would have said we need to follow the example of Jesus, who,

01:13:00.539 --> 01:13:07.659
according to Matthew 16, 14, people thought was Jeremiah, who was from Anathoth. But anyway,

01:13:07.659 --> 01:13:14.699
you can take note of that. But thank you again, brother Nameh. That was a very encouraging and

01:13:14.699 --> 01:13:21.420
stimulating talk. Although these talks were directed to the Gilead graduates, they contain

01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:27.340
beneficial lessons for all of us. We hope you enjoyed part one. Parts two and three will be

01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:35.819
available on JW.org later this month. Our postcard is from the United States. It's a large

01:13:35.819 --> 01:13:42.859
territory encompassing a variety of landscapes. There are majestic mountains, twisting ravines,

01:13:43.579 --> 01:13:51.500
tropical islands, and vast deserts. Across this varied land resides an even greater

01:13:51.500 --> 01:14:00.859
diversity of people. To help all they can, over 1.2 million publishers preach in 114 languages.

01:14:01.819 --> 01:14:07.100
Whether native speakers or learners of a new language, publishers try to reach the heart.

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:13.819
One of the largest language groups in the United States is Haitian Creole. There are

01:14:13.819 --> 01:14:19.020
approximately one million people of Haitian descent in the branch territory with over 10,000

01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:25.579
publishers. Haitians are a vibrant people. As expressed in their energetic dances,

01:14:25.579 --> 01:14:32.859
their colorful clothing, and their delicious food. Just north of Miami, Florida, there's a

01:14:32.859 --> 01:14:39.819
community referred to as Little Haiti. It's here where the 80 publishers of the West Haitian

01:14:39.819 --> 01:14:46.539
Creole congregation search for lovers of truth. They've witnessed in parks and on street corners.

01:14:46.539 --> 01:14:50.460
They've written letters and focused on the family members of their Bible students.

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:56.060
The congregation now conducts on average 126 Bible studies.

01:14:57.340 --> 01:15:02.060
With love, the brothers and sisters of the West Haitian Creole congregation of Miami,

01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:05.899
Florida, send their greetings to the world-wide brotherhood.

01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:19.340
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
