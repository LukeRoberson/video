WEBVTT

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.399
Good day, brothers and sisters.

00:00:18.399 --> 00:00:23.239
Our next session will begin with a music video presentation.

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:29.079
This video shows the beauty of creation and the beauty of our worldwide brotherhood, both

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:31.679
of which bring glory to Jehovah.

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.719
Let's watch and listen.

00:00:33.719 --> 00:10:39.039
Our opening song is an opportunity for each of us to give praise to Jehovah.

00:10:39.039 --> 00:10:43.320
Let's sing song number two entitled Jehovah is Your Name.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:13:41.029
Again, that's song number two.

00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:47.470
When we examine the things Jehovah has made, we see his marvelous qualities.

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:49.870
But can we learn even more?

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:55.230
The following six-part symposium will show how meditating on creation can strengthen

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:58.470
our faith in Jehovah's promises.

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:01.230
Each speaker will introduce the next.

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:07.070
Brother Kenneth Flodin, a helper to the teaching committee, will present the first talk entitled,

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:17.850
whose creation to build your faith stars.

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:23.789
In each of the parts of this symposium, the speaker will help us to see not only the

00:14:23.789 --> 00:14:30.210
wonder of creation, but also the thunder of creation.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:36.210
We will hear Jehovah's words like thunder, loud and clear.

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:40.210
Please find Nehemiah 9.6 with me.

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:47.809
And notice the faith-strengthening effect that creation has on the angels above.

00:14:47.809 --> 00:14:53.850
Nehemiah 9.6, you alone are Jehovah.

00:14:53.850 --> 00:15:01.129
You made the heavens, yes, the heaven of the heavens and all their army, the earth and

00:15:01.129 --> 00:15:06.169
all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them.

00:15:06.169 --> 00:15:11.610
You preserve all of them alive and the army of the heavens are bowing down to you.

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:17.730
Well, that verse extolls Jehovah as the creator.

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:23.450
But did you notice the expression, the heaven of the heavens?

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:25.049
What is that?

00:15:25.049 --> 00:15:32.490
Well, that refers to the complete extent of the physical heavens, the atmospheric heavens,

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:37.330
the heavens of outer space and at the top of the heavens outer space, that rim, that

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:41.129
is the heaven of the heavens, the highest heavens.

00:15:41.129 --> 00:15:46.850
Now, when we look at the heavens, what do we see?

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:48.250
What do we feel?

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:56.649
Well, in that verse, did you notice it mentions first time the heavens and all their army.

00:15:56.649 --> 00:16:03.409
That's referring to the physical army of the heavens, the stars, the planets, the galaxies.

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:08.610
Did you notice in the last sentence, there's another army of the heavens.

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:13.250
And that refers to the holy angels of God.

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:21.210
And just contemplating the physical creation, the angels are moved to bow down or worship

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:29.039
Jehovah, contemplating the creation can have a similar effect on us.

00:16:29.039 --> 00:16:36.279
Now, each talk of this symposium will discuss how meditating on an aspect of creation

00:16:36.279 --> 00:16:42.039
will build our faith in Jehovah's promises.

00:16:42.039 --> 00:16:45.840
Let's watch a video about the stars.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:58.679
And then we will have a faith-strengthening application to our resurrection hope.

00:16:58.679 --> 00:17:12.539
Our sun is considered an average star, yet the energy from the sun that reaches the

00:17:12.539 --> 00:17:26.720
earth is thousands of times the world's total energy use.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:38.049
With our unated eyes, we might see about 3,000 stars on a dark night.

00:17:38.049 --> 00:17:49.779
Many in a fuzzy band, the Milky Way Galaxy, where our sun is just one of, perhaps, 200

00:17:49.779 --> 00:17:57.099
or 400 billion stars.

00:17:57.099 --> 00:18:06.099
Astronomers think the Milky Way Galaxy is clustered together with around 100,000 large galaxies

00:18:06.099 --> 00:18:11.220
in a massive structure called a supercluster.

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:24.779
That together with an estimated 2 trillion galaxies make up the known physical universe.

00:18:24.779 --> 00:18:32.700
Templar stars spread over unfathomable distances, releasing immense amounts of energy may be

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:39.099
impossible to grasp for us, but not for Jehovah.

00:18:39.099 --> 00:18:44.740
He counts the number of the stars, he calls all of them by name.

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:55.180
Our Lord is great and is mighty in power.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:19:02.660
In just a two-minute video about the stars, we see the awesome wonder.

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.980
But do we hear the thunder?

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:13.140
Do we hear the clear, undeniable application from Jehovah our Creator?

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:19.460
I invite you to turn with me to Isaiah 4026, please.

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:27.700
What can we come to appreciate about Jehovah by pondering the magnitude and the magnificence

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:28.700
of the stars?

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:34.420
Well, in Isaiah 4026, Jehovah says, look at the stars.

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:39.740
He says, lift up your eyes to heaven and see.

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.940
Who has created these things?

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.900
The wonder.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:47.700
It is the one who brings out their army by number.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.339
He calls them all by name.

00:19:50.339 --> 00:19:59.059
Because of his vast dynamic energy and his awe-inspiring power, not one of them is missing.

00:19:59.059 --> 00:20:07.099
On the video we saw, it estimated that there are 2 trillion galaxies in outer space, each

00:20:07.099 --> 00:20:10.220
with billions of stars.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.740
So do the math.

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:19.869
How many names of inanimate objects does Jehovah have in his memory?

00:20:19.869 --> 00:20:25.940
How many can he possibly contain?

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:33.220
But did you notice at the end of that verse, it says that not one of them are missing?

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:37.859
It is said that there's a billion trillion stars.

00:20:37.859 --> 00:20:46.140
So I have to ask you, would Jehovah remember your name, your loved one's name, not one

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:47.660
of them is missing?

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.099
Not one star goes missing to Jehovah?

00:20:50.099 --> 00:20:55.059
Well, how about our dead loved ones?

00:20:55.059 --> 00:20:58.259
Did they go missing?

00:20:58.259 --> 00:21:05.140
My favorite verse is when a faithful servant of Jehovah dies, our Romans 14, 7 through 9.

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:15.579
In verse 8, it says, if we live or if we die, we belong to Jehovah.

00:21:15.579 --> 00:21:19.019
The status with Jehovah does not change at death.

00:21:19.019 --> 00:21:23.380
That person did not go missing.

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:28.819
But what about those of us who have loved ones that at the time of their death, they had

00:21:28.819 --> 00:21:33.819
not come to learn about or put faith in Jehovah?

00:21:33.819 --> 00:21:34.819
What about that?

00:21:34.819 --> 00:21:36.619
Well, think about this.

00:21:36.619 --> 00:21:43.660
If Jehovah had the ability, the power to create those huge stars and galaxies, he can

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:50.380
recreate all, all those sleeping in the memorial tombs.

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:52.380
Find John 5, 28, and 29.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:59.140
Let's verify that so that all of us, whether the dead loved one was previously a faithful

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:05.140
witness or not, all of us can entertain the hope of the resurrection.

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:11.940
John 5, 28, and 29 did not be amazed at this.

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:18.019
For the hour is coming in which all, all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice

00:22:18.019 --> 00:22:20.380
and come out.

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:27.140
Those who did good things to a resurrection of life and those who practiced, you see even

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:31.579
vile things to a resurrection of judgment.

00:22:31.579 --> 00:22:37.859
Yes, they'll be restored to life and they'll have the opportunity to come to love the

00:22:37.859 --> 00:22:43.099
one who gifted them with a miracle of a resurrection.

00:22:43.099 --> 00:22:50.619
Now, in our video, right at the end, on screen, there was a quotation of Psalm 147, 4 and

00:22:50.619 --> 00:22:51.619
5.

00:22:51.619 --> 00:22:56.779
In verse 4, it says that Jehovah counts all the stars, the billion trillions or more of

00:22:56.779 --> 00:22:57.779
them.

00:22:57.779 --> 00:23:03.099
It says he named each one the billion or trillion of them.

00:23:03.099 --> 00:23:06.180
That is amazing indeed.

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:09.420
I would like to learn another lesson from the book of Job.

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:15.819
Joe 14, please, we're going to reverse 13 and 15.

00:23:15.819 --> 00:23:21.500
When a star burns out, it does not go missing to Jehovah.

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:28.460
No doubt he remembers its name, but he is not motivated to resurrect that star back to

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:35.140
light so that it can again twinkle in a dark night sky.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.579
But what about humans?

00:23:37.619 --> 00:23:46.660
We were created in the image of Jehovah God and his son, Christ Jesus, Joe 14, 13.

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:54.220
Job says, Oh, that in the grave, you would conceal me, that you would hide me until your

00:23:54.220 --> 00:24:01.500
anger passes by, that you would set a time limit for me and remember me.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:06.660
In verse 14, it's obviously talking about the resurrection, but would Job in effect

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:09.259
just become a burned out star?

00:24:09.259 --> 00:24:11.779
No.

00:24:11.779 --> 00:24:19.259
Unlike a burned out star, Jehovah yearns he longs to call back each human to life so that

00:24:19.259 --> 00:24:24.420
we can again see that star like twinkle in their eyes.

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:31.740
And now verse 15, you, that's Jehovah, we'll call and I will answer you.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:35.740
You see from the grave, I will answer you.

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:44.539
You belong for the work of your hands, but Jehovah has the memory to bring back people.

00:24:44.539 --> 00:24:53.740
He has the power to bring back people and he has the longing to bring back people to life.

00:24:53.740 --> 00:25:05.009
Friends, observe the stars, have faith that you will see your resurrected loved ones.

00:25:05.009 --> 00:25:09.650
And now brother Pat LaFranca, a helper to the personnel committee, will continue this

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:24.339
symposium with his talk, use creation to build your faith, oceans.

00:25:24.339 --> 00:25:30.420
Have you ever stood on the ocean shore, enjoying the salt spray, watching the breakers dash

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:36.099
against the rocks, or run up onto the sandy beach in them withdrawal?

00:25:36.099 --> 00:25:38.819
Many enjoy spending hours at the ocean.

00:25:38.819 --> 00:25:44.579
You never stop marveling at its beauty and its immense size.

00:25:44.579 --> 00:25:50.059
On the other hand, many fear the destructive power of the ocean.

00:25:50.059 --> 00:25:55.140
Like other natural forces, the ocean can act like a powerful giant that sometimes goes

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.259
on a rampage.

00:25:57.259 --> 00:26:04.740
What can man do to stop the wall of water of a tsunami from approaching the coastline?

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:08.859
The power of storm waves is almost unbelievable.

00:26:08.859 --> 00:26:16.940
They have been known to throw boulders weighing 7,000 pounds over a wall 20 feet high.

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:22.660
Can we trust that Jehovah in the future will bring the ocean and other natural forces

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:25.660
into perfect balance?

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:30.900
In the following video, note how the oceans give loud and clear evidence of Jehovah's

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:35.759
wisdom and power.

00:26:35.799 --> 00:27:05.309
Millions of cubic meters of water circulates continually around our planet.

00:27:05.309 --> 00:27:12.670
Near the poles, water that is colder, saltier, and denser sinks.

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:19.230
Creating a flow almost 100 times that of the Amazon River.

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:26.549
This drives a massive circulation of water that may take 1,000 years to complete.

00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:32.180
The global ocean conveyor belt.

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:49.269
This enormous system distributes heat, which helps to stabilize the weather and transports

00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:54.589
great quantities of nutrients around the world.

00:27:54.589 --> 00:28:16.750
So that life may flourish in abundance.

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:24.700
Jehovah set these mechanisms in motion and understands them perfectly.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:35.140
You rule over the raging of the sea when its waves surge you come.

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:41.420
As we saw in our video, the oceans are essential to sustain life on the earth.

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:47.420
Sadly, however, greedy men have trashed them with pollution.

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:53.700
Global warming has caused ocean levels to rise, threatening coastal areas.

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:59.220
Scientists are concerned that the natural forces are so out of balance that soon the planet

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:03.059
will no longer sustain life.

00:29:03.059 --> 00:29:09.700
Yet friends, if Jehovah had the wisdom and power to create the earth's oceans, when his

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:15.779
time comes to bring all natural forces back into perfect balance, he can certainly cause

00:29:15.779 --> 00:29:20.019
us to live in harmony with them.

00:29:20.019 --> 00:29:23.220
Though the oceans might appear to be uncontrollable,

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:27.980
we know that Jehovah is vastly more powerful.

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:34.180
Note how Psalm 93-4 describes his power.

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:36.819
Psalm 93-4.

00:29:36.819 --> 00:29:43.380
Above the sound of many waters, mightier than the breaking waves of the sea, Jehovah

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:46.019
is majestic in the heights.

00:29:46.019 --> 00:29:52.900
Yes, the great sea may lift up its powerful waves to heaven, but it is no match for

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:56.910
our majestic Almighty God.

00:29:56.910 --> 00:30:03.990
Jehovah's powerful ability to perfectly control the oceans gives us great confidence that

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:10.029
he is also perfectly capable of protecting us, his people.

00:30:10.029 --> 00:30:17.910
In Jeremiah 5.22, notice how Jehovah reminds his people of his power.

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:21.309
Jeremiah 5.22.

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:24.430
Do you not fear me, Declare's Jehovah?

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:27.190
Should you not tremble before me?

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:32.950
It is I who place the sand as the boundary for the sea.

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:40.950
A permanent regulation that it cannot pass over, although its waves toss, they cannot prevail,

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:46.109
although they roar, they still cannot pass beyond it.

00:30:46.509 --> 00:30:52.509
Yes, Almighty God placed the sand as the boundary for the sea.

00:30:52.509 --> 00:30:58.069
So when its furious waves pound against sand, the sand absorbs their impact and the

00:30:58.069 --> 00:31:01.390
force vanishes.

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:07.349
Since Jehovah controls the literal roaring sea from going beyond his boundaries, can he

00:31:07.349 --> 00:31:13.470
not also protect his people when the wicked sea of humanity threatens us with his violent

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:16.349
storms?

00:31:16.349 --> 00:31:24.029
Jehovah's control over vast waters was well demonstrated when he protected the Israelites by allowing

00:31:24.029 --> 00:31:27.910
them to cross the Red Sea on dry land.

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:33.829
Now the Red Sea has an average depth of over 1,600 feet.

00:31:33.829 --> 00:31:39.710
It is estimated that at the point where the Israelites crossed it, the depth of the sea

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:43.549
was as much as 50 feet.

00:31:43.549 --> 00:31:49.269
Imagine being in an Israelite, walking through this corridor with walls of water on each side

00:31:49.269 --> 00:31:53.390
of you, some 50 feet high.

00:31:53.390 --> 00:32:00.710
And then Jehovah used those same walls of water to collapse, drowning their enemies, the

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:01.710
Egyptians.

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:08.710
Yes, Jehovah controlled those vast waters to deliver an entire nation from a world power.

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:17.269
And do you recall the account in Mark chapter 4 verses 37 to 39 when God empowered his

00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:22.509
son Jesus to control the sea and the wind?

00:32:22.509 --> 00:32:28.470
When Jesus and the disciples were crossing the sea of Galilee in a boat, a great wind storm

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:33.430
caused the sea to rage and it threatened to fill up their boat.

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:35.430
But did Jesus do?

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:43.109
He commanded the wind and the sea with the words hush, be quiet and the raging wind and

00:32:43.109 --> 00:32:45.869
sea calm down.

00:32:45.869 --> 00:32:53.029
So on this occasion, Jesus showed what He will do as King of God's kingdom during the millennium.

00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:55.910
He will control forces of nature.

00:32:55.910 --> 00:33:00.589
There will be no need to fear the ocean.

00:33:00.589 --> 00:33:06.750
In recent years, disastrous storms are becoming more frequent and severe.

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:14.630
What used to be considered extreme, massive floods, killer droughts and monstrous snowstorms

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:17.269
is the new normal.

00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:24.190
Many experts now put the blame on human activity that has affected the oceans and the climate.

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:30.950
So yes, men continue to ruin their today, but here's the good news.

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:36.589
During the millennium, by means of his kingdom, our wise creator will undo all the damage

00:33:36.589 --> 00:33:38.990
done by humans.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:42.950
Everything will function in harmony with Jehovah's principles.

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:47.269
And we will learn how to properly care for this beautiful planet.

00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:54.029
And as we do, everything will be brought back into proper balance, including the climate

00:33:54.029 --> 00:33:56.910
and the oceans.

00:33:56.910 --> 00:34:01.950
While some men today fear that the earth will be destroyed due to man's abuse, Jehovah

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:08.989
gives us this comforting promise at Psalm 104 and verse 5.

00:34:08.989 --> 00:34:14.739
Psalm 104 and verse 5.

00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:18.699
He has established the earth on His foundations.

00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:23.940
It will not be moved from its place forever and ever.

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:30.219
Yes, the beautiful, deep and dark blue ocean will roll on forever.

00:34:30.219 --> 00:34:33.619
The creator will make sure of that.

00:34:33.619 --> 00:34:40.940
By observing the oceans, meditating on what we see, we can build our faith that soon

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:46.820
we will enjoy Jehovah's creation forever without fear.

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:52.099
Brother James Mance, a helper to the writing committee, will now present the next talk

00:34:52.099 --> 00:35:05.179
of this symposium, use creation to build your faith, forests.

00:35:05.179 --> 00:35:08.539
What would we do without forest?

00:35:08.539 --> 00:35:12.699
Forests help to sustain our supply of fresh water.

00:35:12.699 --> 00:35:19.980
They purify the air, and forests convert carbon dioxide into life-sustaining oxygen.

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:25.860
Yes, forests are vital to our existence.

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:31.420
It's scientists warn that we're in danger of losing this precious resource.

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:37.619
This causes some people to wonder whether God cares about what's happening to the forest.

00:35:37.619 --> 00:35:44.739
We may even ask, will the loss of forest affect God's ability to fulfill His promise to make

00:35:44.739 --> 00:35:47.980
the earth a paradise?

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:53.420
The simple answer to that question is absolutely not.

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:57.820
Jehovah has everything under control.

00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:00.099
Please watch the following video.

00:36:00.099 --> 00:36:09.949
It will strengthen your faith in the designer of the forest.

00:36:09.949 --> 00:36:22.730
Trees can grow very strong and withstand powerful forces.

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:28.610
But if they didn't decompose after they die, trees and leaves would pile up with their

00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:31.530
nutrients locked away inside.

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:34.369
Yet they do decompose.

00:36:34.369 --> 00:36:37.719
How?

00:36:37.719 --> 00:36:43.989
Most animals cannot eat fallen wood and leaves.

00:36:43.989 --> 00:36:47.869
But fungi can.

00:36:47.869 --> 00:36:54.059
They break down the dead plant tissues, making them softer.

00:36:54.059 --> 00:37:00.260
Beetles and termites bore through the wood exposing more surface area and spreading the

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:02.539
fungi inside.

00:37:02.539 --> 00:37:09.889
Which soften it further so that other insects can enjoy the feast.

00:37:09.889 --> 00:37:20.980
Earthworms aerate the soil and pull nutrients down where they can be used by other plants.

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:28.650
Decomposes have been called the unsung heroes of the natural world.

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:36.840
They recycle organic matter so that it is available to support new life.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:43.840
Through this process, Jehovah made it possible for us to enjoy Earth's lush beauty, generation

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:48.300
after generation.

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:52.019
Let the fields and everything in them rejoice.

00:37:52.019 --> 00:38:01.920
At the same time, let all the trees of the forest shout joyfully.

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:02.920
Amazing!

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:07.840
Will you ever look at a forest in the same way again?

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:13.920
Think about what the decomposition and recycling of organic matter means for us and our

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.880
future.

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:23.280
Those beetles, termites and earthworms, the unsung heroes of the natural world will keep

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:28.480
on doing their job throughout eternity.

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:30.400
Reflect for a moment.

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:38.119
If Jehovah had the wisdom to create forests that can replenish themselves, surely he knows

00:38:38.119 --> 00:38:44.159
how to undo the damage that man has done to the Earth.

00:38:44.159 --> 00:38:48.960
Jehovah hasn't revealed all the details of how he is going to restore the Earth, but

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:56.039
we can be confident that he will fulfill his promise to make all things new.

00:38:56.039 --> 00:39:02.000
Please open your Bibles to Psalm 37 verses 10, 11 and 29.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:08.599
The Scripture contains a promise regarding man and the Earth.

00:39:08.599 --> 00:39:15.199
Psalm 37 verses 10, 11 and 29 reads,

00:39:15.199 --> 00:39:19.320
Just a little while longer, and the wicked will be no more.

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:23.800
You will look at where they were, and they will not be there.

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:30.559
But the meek will possess the Earth, and they will find exquisite delight in the abundance

00:39:30.559 --> 00:39:32.599
of peace.

00:39:32.599 --> 00:39:39.519
The righteous will possess the Earth, and they will live forever on it.

00:39:39.519 --> 00:39:46.760
How reassuring people who are righteous and meek will be on the Earth forever, and that

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:49.920
Earth will be a paradise.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:57.320
But there are at least two requirements for Jehovah to accomplish this.

00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:02.920
As already taken care of the first requirement, we saw proof of that in the video.

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:09.280
Jehovah created the forest with an amazing rejuvenation system.

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:15.440
So in spite of man's prolonged misuse of the forest, Jehovah has already put in place

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:22.880
the mechanism to undo all the damage that man has done.

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:30.760
Note the marvelous design of the forest, build your faith in Jehovah's promise of a paradise.

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:36.760
The second requirement to make the Earth a paradise is described in verse 10 of Psalm

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:39.559
37 that we just read.

00:40:39.559 --> 00:40:41.360
There it says,

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:46.000
And the wicked will be no more.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.440
Not only will Jehovah undo the damage that men have done, but he will also remove the

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:54.239
source of the problem.

00:40:54.239 --> 00:41:00.440
Greedy men who exploit and misuse this precious resource will be gone.

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:06.800
Therefore, we have no reason to fear that humans will continue to ruin the Earth until

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:10.519
it reaches the point of no return.

00:41:10.519 --> 00:41:14.000
Jehovah knows what is going on.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:20.039
Please open your Bibles to Revelation chapter 11 and we'll read verse 18.

00:41:20.039 --> 00:41:26.880
The Scripture assures us that Jehovah cares about our planet because it is his planet.

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:34.400
And it confirms that he is going to hold men accountable for their actions.

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:37.679
Revelation chapter 11 verse 18 says,

00:41:37.679 --> 00:41:42.559
But the nations became wrathful and your own wrath came.

00:41:42.559 --> 00:41:47.079
And the appointed time came for the dead to be judged and to reward your slaves the

00:41:47.079 --> 00:41:53.599
prophets and the holy ones and those fearing your name, the small and the great.

00:41:53.599 --> 00:42:00.400
And to bring to ruin those ruining the Earth.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:08.199
Jehovah is not going to let wicked men ruin his beautiful creation.

00:42:08.199 --> 00:42:14.719
Nothing can stop Jehovah from carrying out his purpose for the Earth.

00:42:14.719 --> 00:42:20.599
Our examination of the forest has strengthened our faith that Jehovah will accomplish everything

00:42:20.599 --> 00:42:23.280
that he has in mind to do.

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:29.920
The words of faithful Job reflect our conviction that that promise will come true.

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:33.000
As recorded at Job chapter 42 verse 2,

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.519
Job was moved to declare regarding Jehovah.

00:42:36.519 --> 00:42:43.960
Now I know that you are able to do all things and that nothing you have in mind to do is

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:47.280
impossible for you.

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:50.239
What does Jehovah have in mind to do?

00:42:50.239 --> 00:42:58.440
One thing is to transform the Earth into a paradise with rich, abundant forest.

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:04.440
Forests that will continue to help sustain our supply of fresh water, to purify our air,

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:09.039
and to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen.

00:43:09.039 --> 00:43:15.519
The video that we just watched quoted Psalm 96 verse 12 which declares that the trees

00:43:15.519 --> 00:43:24.760
of the forest shout joyfully by their very existence, forest, praise their Creator.

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:30.559
And we can add our joyful shouts of praise to those of the forest.

00:43:30.559 --> 00:43:38.519
Therefore, may we continue to use creation to build our faith.

00:43:38.519 --> 00:43:44.920
Because if we do that, we will see the restored, life-sustaining forest bring happiness to

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:52.119
perfect humans and praise to their Creator, Jehovah, forever.

00:43:52.119 --> 00:43:56.760
Brother Len Myers, a helper to the writing committee, will now present the next talk of

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.800
this symposium.

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:11.210
Use creation to build your faith, wind, and water.

00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:16.530
And we think of events that will soon happen, such as the Great Tribulation in Armageddon.

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:20.570
Wouldn't you agree that we need to build our faith now?

00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:25.849
In fact, if you turn with me to Ezekiel, chapter 38, and you may want to put a marker there,

00:44:25.849 --> 00:44:31.650
verses 14 and 15 describe the time when God's people will experience and all out assault

00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:35.530
by those determined to destroy pure worship.

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:41.010
Verse 14 mentions that God, or as we know a coalition of nations, will come against God's

00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:42.690
people.

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:47.929
And though, verse 18 states that on that day, Jehovah's great rage will flare up against

00:44:47.929 --> 00:44:49.250
his enemies.

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:57.050
The question is, will you and I remain confident in Jehovah's promise to rescue his people?

00:44:57.050 --> 00:45:03.090
We can build our faith by considering another aspect of creation, the awesome power of wind

00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:05.090
and water.

00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:23.659
These allow the following video to strengthen your faith.

00:45:23.659 --> 00:45:36.429
Hale, though it is made of ice, it is very different from snow.

00:45:36.429 --> 00:45:44.110
Hale usually forms in warm weather, when turbulent air produces thunderstorms with powerful

00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:46.909
updrafts.

00:45:46.909 --> 00:45:53.429
Those updrafts can pull a piece of dust or ice high into the cloud where water freezes

00:45:53.429 --> 00:45:55.070
around it.

00:45:55.070 --> 00:46:01.750
Each trip up into the cloud adds a layer of ice and weight.

00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:13.300
Until it becomes a Hale stone that is heavy enough to fall, Hale storms can be powerfully

00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:18.989
destructive.

00:46:18.989 --> 00:46:27.690
One deadly storm dropped Hale stones weighing more than one kilogram each.

00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:34.489
Jehovah used Hale to demonstrate his power and defend his people, such as during the

00:46:34.489 --> 00:46:38.889
seventh plague against Egypt.

00:46:38.889 --> 00:46:45.329
When Joshua fought the Amorites, Jehovah caused a great Hale storm and more Amorites died

00:46:45.329 --> 00:46:51.150
from the Hale stones done in battle.

00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:57.309
Hale is also mentioned among the elements Jehovah will use in the future against those

00:46:57.309 --> 00:47:00.429
who attack his people.

00:47:00.429 --> 00:47:06.070
Have you seen the storehouses of the Hale, which I have reserved for the day of battle

00:47:06.070 --> 00:47:07.070
and war?

00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:15.940
As the video showed, wind and water in the form of Hale are powerful and can at times

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:18.300
be very destructive.

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:23.420
For example, a report in a Wake magazine some years ago reported that at times humans

00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:30.460
are hurt, even killed by Hale stones weighing as much as one and a half pounds and as big

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:34.059
as five inches in diameter.

00:47:34.059 --> 00:47:36.940
That's larger than this ball.

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:41.699
And there are scientific reports of even larger Hale stones.

00:47:41.699 --> 00:47:46.860
But as we know, Jehovah can use wind and water to fight for his people while he's the

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:52.420
source of these natural forces and he can control them perfectly.

00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:56.179
Please turn with me to Psalm 147 and let's notice that together.

00:47:56.179 --> 00:48:02.820
Psalm 147 will look at verses 17 and 18 for the assurance that Jehovah is the source

00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:05.539
of these natural forces.

00:48:05.539 --> 00:48:12.460
Psalm 147, 17, he hurls down his Hale stones like morsels of bread.

00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:14.699
Who can withstand his cold?

00:48:14.699 --> 00:48:17.539
He sends out his word and they melt.

00:48:17.539 --> 00:48:22.860
He makes his wind blow and the waters flow.

00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:25.980
Did you notice to whom these natural forces belong?

00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:29.739
Verse 17 speaks of his Hale stones.

00:48:29.739 --> 00:48:33.179
Verse 18 says he makes his wind blow.

00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:37.860
Yes, Jehovah is the source and he can control them.

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:39.860
He proved this in the past.

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:43.179
Do you remember the examples given in the video?

00:48:43.179 --> 00:48:48.539
One was the account in Joshua chapter 10 when the Israelites were fighting the Amorites.

00:48:48.539 --> 00:48:53.699
Verse 11 states that while the Amorites were fleeing from Israel, Jehovah hurled great

00:48:53.699 --> 00:48:57.820
Hale stones from the sky on them and they perished.

00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:04.420
In fact, more died from the Hale than from the sword of the Israelites.

00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:10.579
If Jehovah can create such powerful elements and control them, that should build our faith.

00:49:10.579 --> 00:49:15.059
It should convince us that he'll be able to use these powerful elements in the future

00:49:15.059 --> 00:49:19.139
when he defends his people at Armageddon.

00:49:19.139 --> 00:49:23.019
The video partially quoted a scripture that emphasizes that point.

00:49:23.019 --> 00:49:24.019
Let's read it together.

00:49:24.019 --> 00:49:35.500
Job chapter 38, and notice with me verses 22 and 23.

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:43.750
Job 38, 22, have you entered the storehouses of the snow or have you seen the storehouses

00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:51.110
of the Hale which I have reserved for the time of distress, for the day of battle and war?

00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:57.829
Did you notice that Jehovah says he has storehouses of Hale reserved for the day of battle?

00:49:57.829 --> 00:50:02.309
So on 135 verse 7 mentions storehouses of wind.

00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:10.190
In these verses, Jehovah speaks of things he's reserved under his control for special purposes.

00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:15.550
How can this knowledge of Jehovah's storehouses build our faith?

00:50:15.550 --> 00:50:20.030
When we're attacked during the Great Tribulation by God's enemies, no matter how powerful

00:50:20.110 --> 00:50:25.909
or threatening they may seem, they can't possibly survive Jehovah's anger.

00:50:25.909 --> 00:50:32.110
For example, if we go back to Ezekiel chapter 38 and glance at verse 22, we see things

00:50:32.110 --> 00:50:36.230
Jehovah will use against those enemies of pure worship.

00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:40.989
Besides pestilence, fire, and sulfur, notice what else Jehovah will use in the middle

00:50:40.989 --> 00:50:42.269
of the verse.

00:50:42.269 --> 00:50:49.869
It says, I will reign down a torrential downpour and Hale stones.

00:50:49.869 --> 00:50:55.909
As Jehovah will use water, he may use Hale stones of undisclosed size to destroy those

00:50:55.909 --> 00:50:58.710
wicked humans.

00:50:58.710 --> 00:51:03.230
Now during that time, will we need to fear the natural elements?

00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:04.869
Not at all.

00:51:04.869 --> 00:51:11.190
Second Peter chapter 2 verse 9 assures us, Jehovah knows how to rescue people of godly devotion

00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:13.190
out of trial.

00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:19.699
Jehovah will perfectly control the natural elements so his people are not harmed.

00:51:19.699 --> 00:51:26.300
This knowledge about the awesome power of wind and water should make us powerful by faith.

00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:30.860
It should build our faith not only in Jehovah's ability to protect us in the future, but

00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:33.659
also in his protection now.

00:51:33.659 --> 00:51:39.900
For instance, we have no reason to fear bands or threats from worldly governments.

00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:44.820
The one who controls the storehouses of the wind and Hale is our helper.

00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:50.900
According to Hebrews chapter 13 verse 6, we do not need to be afraid.

00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:55.500
That's true now, and it will be true in the future when Jehovah brings the natural

00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:59.780
elements at his disposal against our enemies.

00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:06.460
Notice his assurance at the end of Ezekiel chapter 38, notice verse 23.

00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:11.659
And I will certainly magnify myself and sanctify myself and make myself known before the

00:52:11.659 --> 00:52:18.739
eyes of many nations, and they will have to know that I am Jehovah.

00:52:18.739 --> 00:52:21.500
What a thrilling time that will be.

00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:26.860
As these enemies are defeated, they will know that it is Jehovah God who is bringing destruction

00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:29.300
upon them.

00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:34.579
May our anticipation of that happy outcome and our study of creation build our faith

00:52:34.579 --> 00:52:42.170
now as we confidently look forward to Jehovah's complete victory.

00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:45.769
For the Robert Lucioni, a helper to the publishing committee will now present the next

00:52:45.769 --> 00:52:58.539
talk of this symposium, use creation to build your faith, see creatures.

00:52:58.539 --> 00:53:03.340
Are you struggling to provide for yourself or your family?

00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:09.900
Many today lack the basic necessity such as food, clean water, adequate housing.

00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:15.460
And this causes some to question whether God really cares about humans.

00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:17.820
But as Jehovah's people, we are different.

00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:22.900
We know that Jehovah cares for all of his creation.

00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:29.099
But we all know that it is a test of our faith when things get difficult.

00:53:29.099 --> 00:53:34.260
So the question is how can we build our faith so that we are strong and it can help us

00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:38.019
get through difficult times?

00:53:38.019 --> 00:53:43.460
One way is by examining how Jehovah provides for his animal creation.

00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:45.460
Now why is that helpful?

00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:51.059
Well that examination gives us confidence that he will care for us as well.

00:53:51.059 --> 00:53:57.619
As an example in the following video, note how Jehovah provides food for a massive sea

00:53:57.619 --> 00:54:02.670
creature.

00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:14.119
The largest animal alive on earth today is also the largest that has ever lived.

00:54:14.119 --> 00:54:32.670
The blue whale, blue whales can grow to be over 30 meters long and weigh up to 180 tons.

00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:37.989
Its heart alone may weigh several hundred kilograms.

00:54:37.989 --> 00:54:44.820
How does such a large creature find enough to eat?

00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:55.079
The blue whale migrates great distances to find tiny crustaceans, known as krill.

00:54:55.079 --> 00:55:02.039
When a blue whale finds a school of krill, it accelerates towards the krill and opens its

00:55:02.039 --> 00:55:06.090
giant mouth.

00:55:06.090 --> 00:55:15.300
The main gulf hundreds of kilograms of krill with each lunge, amounting to several tons

00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:18.860
per day.

00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:44.090
The blue whales eat a lot, yet Jehovah provides for them and he will provide for us.

00:55:44.090 --> 00:55:52.889
There is the sea, so great and wide, teeming with countless living things, both small and

00:55:52.889 --> 00:55:58.139
great.

00:55:58.139 --> 00:56:03.380
Now we are amazed at the way Jehovah provides for all of his animal creation, including

00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:05.219
the sea creatures.

00:56:05.219 --> 00:56:12.380
The Bible describes this well if you look at Psalm 104, verses 27 and 28.

00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:21.219
All of them wait for you to give them their food in its season.

00:56:21.219 --> 00:56:23.980
What you give them, they gather.

00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:29.099
When you open your hand, they are satisfied with good things.

00:56:29.099 --> 00:56:34.500
Yes, meditating on this aspect of creation builds our faith.

00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:39.659
For example, from the video, do you remember the size of this creature?

00:56:39.659 --> 00:56:45.260
Now can you imagine if you have the assignment to feed just one blue whale?

00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:48.619
You just make sure that one whale has enough to eat every day.

00:56:48.619 --> 00:56:50.380
Can you imagine that?

00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:51.380
Where would we start?

00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:56.199
We'd have to hire teams of people, figure out how to get the food and how to move the

00:56:56.199 --> 00:56:58.860
food to where the blue whale is swimming.

00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:03.300
After we figure out where he's swimming, why it would be a full-time job?

00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:08.179
And that would be to feed just one whale and this thousand of them.

00:57:08.179 --> 00:57:14.420
And yet, Jehovah has it all arranged day after day, we don't even think about it.

00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:19.119
You notice in verse 27, it says that all of them wait for Jehovah to give them their

00:57:19.119 --> 00:57:20.119
food.

00:57:20.119 --> 00:57:23.699
Now, it doesn't mean that the whale just kind of floats on the top of the water and

00:57:23.699 --> 00:57:25.460
waits for food to jump in his mouth.

00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:31.460
Now, it swims, it looks for the food when it finds it, it goes after it, but Jehovah

00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:33.739
provides it.

00:57:33.739 --> 00:57:38.099
Verse 28, it says, what he gives them, they gather.

00:57:38.099 --> 00:57:44.539
Now, you cannot imagine that blue whale thinking, come on, really, I'm 180 tons and you're

00:57:44.539 --> 00:57:46.539
going to feed me with a little crustacean.

00:57:46.539 --> 00:57:51.099
Couldn't we have just worked out that I eat a couple big tuna every day?

00:57:51.099 --> 00:57:55.260
No, they gather what Jehovah gives them.

00:57:55.260 --> 00:58:01.179
And verse 28 goes on to say they are satisfied with Jehovah's provisions.

00:58:01.179 --> 00:58:02.300
So what's the point?

00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:05.940
Well, did you notice the comment in the video?

00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:12.179
It said, Jehovah provides for them and he will provide for us.

00:58:12.179 --> 00:58:18.340
See, meditating on creation can build our faith, strengthen our faith in Jehovah's

00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:20.019
support.

00:58:20.019 --> 00:58:26.179
Note the four lessons that we learn from how Jehovah cares for his creation.

00:58:26.179 --> 00:58:32.139
The first is is that if Jehovah has the desire to care for animals and

00:58:32.139 --> 00:58:38.420
provide for their needs, do you think that Jehovah has the desire to care for you and

00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:40.179
your family?

00:58:40.179 --> 00:58:46.059
Remember what Jesus expressed in Matthew, chapter 6, verse 26, where there he explained

00:58:46.059 --> 00:58:50.179
how Jehovah cares for his creation, even the small birds.

00:58:50.179 --> 00:58:53.980
And he said, are you not worth more than they are?

00:58:53.980 --> 00:59:00.019
Yes, if Jehovah feels compelled to care for his animal creation, we can be assured that

00:59:00.019 --> 00:59:04.980
he feels compelled to care for you and your family.

00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:10.659
A second lesson is that we do not need to be unduly anxious about tomorrow.

00:59:10.659 --> 00:59:15.260
Rather, we can confidently ask Jehovah for our daily needs.

00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:20.860
Look at Matthew, chapter 6, verse 31 and 32.

00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:24.019
Matthew 6, 31 and 32.

00:59:24.019 --> 00:59:31.659
This is so never be anxious and say, what are we to eat or what are we to drink or what

00:59:31.659 --> 00:59:33.900
are we to wear?

00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:38.179
For all these are the things the nations are eagerly pursuing.

00:59:38.179 --> 00:59:42.059
Your Heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.

00:59:42.059 --> 00:59:44.179
Yes, Jehovah knows we need them.

00:59:44.179 --> 00:59:49.699
He knows exactly what we need and he promises to provide it.

00:59:49.699 --> 00:59:57.059
And if Jehovah has the capacity to feed a 180 ton blue whale, do you think he has the

00:59:57.059 --> 01:00:01.139
capacity to feed you and me and our families?

01:00:01.139 --> 01:00:02.139
Absolutely.

01:00:02.139 --> 01:00:06.940
See, we do the best that we can and then we trust in Jehovah to do the rest.

01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:12.380
And like it mentioned there in Psalms with the animal creation, we wait on Jehovah and

01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:16.780
we are satisfied with what he provides.

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:22.340
Our third point is that Jehovah will not abandon us when we face trials.

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:27.500
Look at Hebrews chapter 13 and the latter part of verse 5.

01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:35.579
Hebrews 13 5, he says, I will never leave you and I will never abandon you.

01:00:35.579 --> 01:00:37.219
Jehovah will never abandon us.

01:00:37.219 --> 01:00:40.900
He will care for us even through our hard times.

01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:42.900
Now how can that help us?

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:47.539
All that can help us to make good decisions, good decisions regarding our employment,

01:00:47.539 --> 01:00:50.860
care for our family, worship of Jehovah.

01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:56.019
We will remember Jesus words in Matthew chapter 6, verse 33, where he says, seek first

01:00:56.019 --> 01:01:02.820
the kingdom and all these other things will be given to you.

01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:06.019
And finally, our fourth point.

01:01:06.019 --> 01:01:11.659
Jehovah promises that he will abundantly care for all of our needs in the future.

01:01:11.659 --> 01:01:17.179
We think of that beautiful promise in Isaiah chapter 65 and verse 22, where it says, for

01:01:17.179 --> 01:01:22.619
the days of my people will be like the days of a tree.

01:01:22.619 --> 01:01:27.420
Now the blue whale is thought to live 80 to 90 years.

01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:29.099
And Jehovah keeps providing for it.

01:01:29.099 --> 01:01:31.980
He does not have a limited supplier provision.

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:37.480
Well, that gives us confidence that it's not beyond Jehovah's ability to fulfill his

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:42.239
promise and care for us through all eternity.

01:01:42.239 --> 01:01:49.880
So yes, Jehovah's word and his creation give us irrefutable proof of his constant loving

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:50.880
care.

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:56.280
Proof that he cares for us today, that he will care for us through our difficult days

01:01:56.280 --> 01:02:00.719
and proof that he will care for us through all eternity.

01:02:00.719 --> 01:02:08.480
So may all of us continue to build our faith, fortify our trust in Jehovah, become powerful

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:10.360
by faith.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:17.719
We need that faith now and we most definitely will need it to face what is to come.

01:02:17.719 --> 01:02:22.440
Now brother Ron Kerzen, a helper to the teaching committee, will present the final talk of

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:35.690
this symposium, use creation to build your faith, our bodies.

01:02:35.690 --> 01:02:38.809
Are you tired of being tired?

01:02:38.809 --> 01:02:42.369
Are you sick of being sick?

01:02:42.369 --> 01:02:47.889
Many of us are feeling the impact of living in this old system of things, but what can we

01:02:47.889 --> 01:02:48.889
do?

01:02:48.889 --> 01:02:55.969
Well, we try to improve our health or find some relief by medical means or improving our

01:02:55.969 --> 01:02:59.849
diet, exercise and getting more rest.

01:02:59.849 --> 01:03:08.409
But the bottom line is, we are infected with sin and with sin comes sickness and the effects

01:03:08.409 --> 01:03:10.409
of aging.

01:03:10.409 --> 01:03:14.969
There's promise after promise, but are they really true?

01:03:14.969 --> 01:03:23.849
There is no pill, medicine, diet or exercise program that can give us complete relief, removal

01:03:23.849 --> 01:03:30.690
of sickness or what we really want and what we need, perfect health.

01:03:30.690 --> 01:03:36.449
But there is a promise recorded in God's word that does give us confidence.

01:03:36.449 --> 01:03:44.730
Let's read this together at Isaiah chapter 33, Isaiah 33, and notice the reassuring words

01:03:44.730 --> 01:03:49.409
from Jehovah through the prophet Isaiah in verse 24.

01:03:49.409 --> 01:03:56.130
And there it says, and no resident, no one will say, I am sick.

01:03:56.130 --> 01:03:59.889
The people dwelling in the land will be pardoned for their error.

01:03:59.889 --> 01:04:05.090
So sin will be removed in God's new world.

01:04:05.090 --> 01:04:07.210
Do you believe that?

01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:11.250
Can we really put faith in Jehovah's promise?

01:04:11.250 --> 01:04:16.730
Yes, this is not just another empty promise by a human.

01:04:16.730 --> 01:04:19.570
This comes from our creator, Jehovah.

01:04:19.570 --> 01:04:23.409
Yes, he can guarantee it.

01:04:23.409 --> 01:04:28.969
But what can we do today to build up our faith in those promises?

01:04:28.969 --> 01:04:35.570
Well, as highlighted in this symposium, we can take the time and stop to look at Jehovah's

01:04:35.570 --> 01:04:36.570
creation.

01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:39.130
So let's do that right now.

01:04:39.130 --> 01:04:45.369
Let's examine the human body and its amazing ability to repair itself.

01:04:45.369 --> 01:04:55.760
Please watch the following video.

01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:00.519
Our bones are amazing.

01:05:00.519 --> 01:05:12.309
They support our bodies, protect our organs, and store almost all of the bodies calcium,

01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:17.940
a mineral essential for our health.

01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:25.230
For their weight, bones are very strong.

01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:31.150
The feats of a track and field jumper may experience forces of several times his body

01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:35.889
weight.

01:05:35.889 --> 01:05:46.210
Bones can compress and bend, but sometimes they break.

01:05:46.210 --> 01:05:51.809
A fractured bone can heal well, if properly said.

01:05:51.809 --> 01:05:58.610
Inflination brings organic building blocks to the area, and soft tissue grows between

01:05:58.610 --> 01:06:02.679
the broken pieces.

01:06:02.679 --> 01:06:08.400
The soft tissue is replaced with harder tissue.

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:22.150
The body replaces the harder tissue with new bone, until the repair is complete.

01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:27.909
In children, the break may heal without leaving a trace.

01:06:27.909 --> 01:06:35.789
Jehovah gave every bone in our body this incredible ability to heal.

01:06:35.789 --> 01:06:43.510
I praise you because in an awe-inspiring way, I am wonderfully made.

01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:52.449
Well, that was an amazing video.

01:06:52.449 --> 01:06:55.690
We learned a lot about what happens on the inside.

01:06:55.690 --> 01:07:00.849
We take it for granted that when we get a cut, broken bone, that our body automatically

01:07:00.849 --> 01:07:02.809
heals itself.

01:07:02.809 --> 01:07:07.730
King David was very impressed with the way that he was made and the way the human body

01:07:07.730 --> 01:07:08.730
works.

01:07:08.730 --> 01:07:14.449
But he did not have the modern technology and knowledge that we have today, an X-ray

01:07:14.449 --> 01:07:19.409
machine, or a microscope, but he observed Jehovah's creation.

01:07:19.409 --> 01:07:24.570
And he knew that we were designed in an awe-inspiring way.

01:07:24.570 --> 01:07:31.340
Let's read what he says at Psalm 139, Psalm 139 and verse 14.

01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:34.739
I'm sure you feel the same way.

01:07:34.739 --> 01:07:42.420
He says, I praise you because in an awe-inspiring way, I am wonderfully made.

01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:44.659
Your works are wonderful.

01:07:44.659 --> 01:07:48.579
I know this very well.

01:07:48.579 --> 01:07:55.940
So what helped David to build a strong faith in Jehovah and his promises for the future?

01:07:55.940 --> 01:07:56.940
Well, did you read there?

01:07:56.940 --> 01:08:00.539
He says, I know this very well.

01:08:00.539 --> 01:08:06.219
David took the time to stop and observe Jehovah's creations.

01:08:06.219 --> 01:08:09.219
That's what helped him to put faith in Jehovah.

01:08:09.219 --> 01:08:15.539
Yes, he took the time, not to be distracted by other things going around him, but to observe

01:08:15.539 --> 01:08:17.340
Jehovah's creations.

01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:22.659
That's what inspired him, and that's what motivated him to give praise to Jehovah.

01:08:22.659 --> 01:08:24.260
And we need to do the same.

01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:30.300
Yes, we are far from the perfect health and life that Jehovah had intended for the future.

01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:34.380
But even so, we are made in an awe-inspiring way.

01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:38.420
Jehovah wants us to continue living, it's plain to see.

01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:43.939
And as we saw in the video, our bodies are amazing that they can continue to repair themselves

01:08:43.939 --> 01:08:47.180
even without a conscious thought.

01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:50.060
But they're in lies the problem.

01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:56.939
We could be so busy with our lives that we don't stop and take that time to have a thought.

01:08:56.939 --> 01:08:59.340
Why did Jehovah make this?

01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:01.699
Why did he create me the way he did?

01:09:01.699 --> 01:09:06.979
Yes, we're busy thinking about how we'll care for our families, pay the bills, or maybe

01:09:06.979 --> 01:09:09.020
take care of our health.

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:16.579
But like David, we need to stop, pause, think deeply about what Jehovah has made.

01:09:16.579 --> 01:09:22.939
People miss out on an opportunity to be inspired like David with all the inspiring creations

01:09:22.939 --> 01:09:25.060
around us.

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:30.220
And think about this, if Jehovah could create our bodies with the ability to repair themselves

01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:35.140
like we saw in the video, he can certainly heal all infirmities.

01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:42.300
He can reverse the aging process, and he can prevent sickness in his new world.

01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:47.819
While on earth, Jesus proved with the power he was given from Jehovah that he could cure

01:09:47.819 --> 01:09:52.699
every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity.

01:09:52.699 --> 01:10:00.859
Every sort meant everything from healing the blind, the lame, those with epilepsy, leprosy,

01:10:00.859 --> 01:10:04.619
to raising the dead to life.

01:10:04.619 --> 01:10:09.500
That truly is an amazing thing to ponder.

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:13.699
Now that must have been an amazing thing to see back then, but what Jesus did was just

01:10:13.699 --> 01:10:21.020
a preview on a small scale of what he will do in the future worldwide on a large scale

01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:25.500
under God's kingdom arrangement during the millennium.

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:31.500
We will finally see that promise we read in Isaiah that no resident will say, I am sick.

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:32.500
Why?

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:40.100
Jesus will use his kingly power to bring about perfect health, yes, lasting health.

01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:46.380
Jehovah's promises they fill us with hope, they fill us with confidence that every sort

01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:53.220
of disease and illness, anything that we're going through now, it's only temporary knowing

01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:58.020
that permanent, perfect health is soon to come.

01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:03.060
This symposium has considered examples ranging from the heavens all the way to the inner

01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:07.340
workings of our amazing bodies.

01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:11.300
Jehovah left his imprint on all of his creations.

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:15.300
The evidence is clearly seen, it's evident.

01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:22.100
What must we do today to build our faith and confidence in Jehovah's promises?

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:29.760
Notice what Romans chapter 1 and verse 20 has to say.

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:36.800
Here in verse 20, Romans 1 and verse 20, for his invisible qualities are clearly seen

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:40.760
from the world's creation onward, why?

01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:47.000
Because they are perceived by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship, so that

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.079
they are inexcusable.

01:11:50.079 --> 01:11:53.039
Let's focus in on the word perceived.

01:11:53.039 --> 01:11:57.520
It's interesting that the study note says that perceived means more than just seeing something

01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:59.720
with our literal eyes.

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:05.039
It means grasping or understanding with our mind.

01:12:05.039 --> 01:12:10.680
One Bible translation says, God's qualities are visible to the eye of reason.

01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:12.199
That's interesting.

01:12:12.199 --> 01:12:19.239
So when we see Jehovah's creations, take the time like David did to stop and think deeply,

01:12:19.239 --> 01:12:25.560
meditate on what we can learn from that creation, what it tells us about our creator, Jehovah.

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:33.520
It happens when we perceive Jehovah's wisdom, his power, his justice, his love and creations,

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:39.560
its strength is our faith and his promises now, as well as in the future.

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:45.800
May we always be inspired and stay inspired by Jehovah's all-inspiring creations, and

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:53.880
thus we will always be inspired by our Almighty God and Creator, Jehovah.

01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:57.960
Thank you, brothers, for helping us think deeply about the things Jehovah has made and

01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:59.760
the things he will do.

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:04.840
What wonderful blessings we have to look forward to!

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:11.840
We now invite you to sing song number 148 entitled Jehovah Provides Escape.

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:14.439
Again, that song number 148.
