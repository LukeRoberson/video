00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:29.100
Why should I fear the lion?

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:35.210
Why should I fear any foe?

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.109
With Jehovah by my side,

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:42.509
I will not run and hide.

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:48.509
My God is with me this, I know.

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:55.409
With eyes of faith, I see beyond the darkness.

00:00:55.509 --> 00:01:00.909
With eyes of faith, there's nothing more to fear.

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:06.459
With Jehovah I am strong,

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:11.349
Determined to go on,

00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:48.099
That my God is always me.

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:51.099
The future is assured,

00:01:51.099 --> 00:02:35.699
They'll stand again.

00:02:35.699 --> 00:03:09.860
With a hope is short.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:24.319
Till Jehovah claims his victory.
