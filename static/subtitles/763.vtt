00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:04.960
What do the following have in common?

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:13.460
Build an ark, choose 300 men, march around the city seven times,

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.460
follow this route to the Red Sea.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.460
Did you figure it out?

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.460
Jehovah was providing his people with direction.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.460
And in the case of these examples, sometimes that direction

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.460
could appear to be, let's say, a bit unusual.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.460
It's not too hard for us to imagine Noah responding,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.460
and you want me to build a massive ark, or Gideon asking,

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.460
just 300 men against an army of 135,000?

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.460
Are you sure?

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.460
Or Joshua replying, march around Jericho seven times,

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.460
and just blow our horns?

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.460
That's it?

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.459
O Moses saying, why are we headed to the Red Sea

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:10.459
when I believe there is a much more direct route

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:13.459
to the promised land?

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:18.459
They all could have responded in such ways.

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:20.459
But did they?

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:23.459
Let's allow the Bible to help us find the answer.

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:26.459
Genesis chapter 6.

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:30.459
In Genesis chapter 6, verse 22,

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:37.459
we find that Noah did according to all that God had commanded him.

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:41.459
He did just so.

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:49.459
In fact, in the examples we've mentioned, they all did just so.

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:53.459
The direction might not have been what they expected,

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:57.459
but they humbly made the mental turn, so to speak,

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:03.459
and they followed the divine guidance wherever it was taking them.

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:08.460
And because they did, they saved not only themselves,

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.460
but all those that were with them.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.460
Clearly, the one leading them was Jehovah,

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.699
and by their responsive actions,

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:24.699
they were in effect saying to him,

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:28.699
where you go, I will go.

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:33.699
Well, what about you dear graduates here before us today?

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:36.699
Like those faithful ones of old,

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:41.699
you are not alone in navigating your way.

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:45.699
Jehovah is where he has always been.

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:49.699
At the helm, guiding his people.

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:53.699
The only difference is today,

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:59.699
Jehovah is providing direction through his faithful and discreet slay.

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:02.699
And it is due to our limited understanding

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:09.699
that at times the direction may appear to be a bit unusual.

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:14.699
Nonetheless, you have followed that direction,

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:19.699
no matter what it was, no matter where it was taking you.

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:24.699
And for that, we want to say thank you.

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:28.699
In fact, we want to thank all of you in our listening audience

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:33.699
for being responsive toward the direction providing.

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:37.699
But we think especially you dear Gilead graduates

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:40.699
before us today, now why?

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:44.699
Because during the five months that we have spent with you,

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:46.699
we saw you.

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:51.699
We saw how you closely followed the direction of the faithful slave.

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:54.699
You did just so.

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:59.699
For example, when presenting your student assignments,

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:01.699
you did so in English,

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:06.699
even though for most of you, that was not your mother tongue.

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:09.699
And when COVID protocols were set in place,

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:12.699
we saw you follow all of them,

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:15.699
even though they might have been inconvenient,

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:19.699
in order to keep you and your classmates healthy.

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:21.699
And when you were given counsel,

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:23.699
not only from your instructors,

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.699
but from each other,

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.699
you expressed gratitude for it

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:34.110
and immediately went to work out applying it.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.110
We saw you growing your love for one another,

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.110
for God's organization, for Jehovah,

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.110
and for His Son Jesus.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:50.110
All of this was a direct result of your sensitivity

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.579
to the direction of the faithful slave.

00:04:54.579 --> 00:04:58.579
But what about after you leave this place?

00:04:58.579 --> 00:05:03.579
Even if you are assigned back to the country of origin,

00:05:03.579 --> 00:05:07.579
you won't be the same person that left.

00:05:07.579 --> 00:05:12.579
And things may not be the way you remember them either.

00:05:12.579 --> 00:05:15.579
However, we have full confidence

00:05:15.579 --> 00:05:20.579
that whatever future changes come your way.

00:05:20.579 --> 00:05:26.579
You will continue echoing the sentiments of the Moabitis Ruth.

00:05:26.579 --> 00:05:31.579
Recall when she was faced with numerous intimidating changes,

00:05:31.579 --> 00:05:34.579
what she said to Naomi.

00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:37.579
Her words are recorded for us in Ruth chapter 1,

00:05:37.579 --> 00:05:42.579
the book bearing her name, verse 16 and 17.

00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:45.579
Ruth said,

00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:48.579
Do not plead with me to abandon you,

00:05:48.579 --> 00:05:51.579
to turn back from accompanying you.

00:05:51.579 --> 00:05:54.579
For where you go,

00:05:54.579 --> 00:05:57.579
I will go.

00:05:57.579 --> 00:05:59.579
And where you spend the night,

00:05:59.579 --> 00:06:01.579
I will spend the night.

00:06:01.579 --> 00:06:03.579
Your people will be my people,

00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:06.579
and your God, my God.

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:09.579
Where you die, I will die.

00:06:09.579 --> 00:06:12.579
And there I will be buried.

00:06:12.579 --> 00:06:15.579
May Jehovah do so to me and add to it

00:06:15.579 --> 00:06:17.579
if anything but death

00:06:17.579 --> 00:06:23.060
should separate me from you.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.370
Now what did all of this actually mean for Ruth?

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.370
It meant leaving what was familiar to her.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:39.370
It meant adopting a people with beliefs different from hers.

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.370
It meant following customs

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.370
that could result in her becoming the wife of someone she did not choose

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.370
or did not even know for that matter.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:55.370
It meant never returning to what she had left behind.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.370
When Ruth said to Naomi,

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.370
Where you go, I will go.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.370
She met with no clauses,

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.370
no exceptions, no bargaining.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.370
It was without question.

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.370
For Ruth these were not just words.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.370
It was her mind set.

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.370
It was the same mindset that Noah,

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:22.370
Gideon, Joshua, and Moses had.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.370
And like them,

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:30.370
he endeavored to always see the one behind the direction.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:35.370
We will be able to move in heart harmony with the chariot.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.370
Not under it, not behind it,

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.370
right alongside it.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:47.370
In fact, this thought brings back to my mind a fond memory.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:50.370
I recall when my wife and I lived in South Africa,

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:54.370
I observed a flock of birds in motion.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:57.370
What species I do not know.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:01.370
But I'm sure they numbered into the thousands.

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:06.370
And as they swirled and turned as a group in unison,

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:11.370
it was a beautiful magnificent sight to behold.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:15.370
What's interesting is that scientists think

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:19.370
that each bird focuses not on the entire flock,

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:25.370
but on just a few of its most nearest neighbors in flight.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:30.370
When those near them turn, they turn.

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:37.779
Each one does this creating a sort of harmonious wave effect.

00:08:37.779 --> 00:08:39.779
Well, in a similar way,

00:08:39.779 --> 00:08:45.779
when we display by our speech in actions the mindset,

00:08:45.779 --> 00:08:51.779
Jehovah, where you and your slave go, I will go,

00:08:51.779 --> 00:08:56.779
we motivate others near us to do the same.

00:08:56.779 --> 00:09:00.779
When a change in theocratic direction comes,

00:09:00.779 --> 00:09:03.779
and we make the turn,

00:09:03.779 --> 00:09:09.779
then our spiritual brothers and sisters make the turn with us.

00:09:09.779 --> 00:09:14.779
And when Jehovah's people turn in sync in mid-flight, so to speak,

00:09:14.779 --> 00:09:19.779
it is a beautiful thing in the eyes of Jehovah.

00:09:19.779 --> 00:09:26.779
Just as Noah, Gideon, Joshua, Moses, and Ruth,

00:09:26.779 --> 00:09:30.779
set the pattern for all of us.

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:39.779
Now, dear graduates, it is your turn to set the pattern for others.

00:09:39.779 --> 00:09:43.779
As you continue to follow closely,

00:09:43.779 --> 00:09:49.779
the direction provided by Jehovah, through his faithful slave,

00:09:49.779 --> 00:09:52.779
others will see his blessing upon you.

00:09:52.779 --> 00:09:57.779
They will see how he is keeping you safe and secure.

00:09:57.779 --> 00:10:01.779
They will see your joy and contentment.

00:10:01.779 --> 00:10:05.779
And out of a keen desire to have that same experience,

00:10:05.779 --> 00:10:09.779
they too will be motivated to say,

00:10:09.779 --> 00:10:12.779
where you go, I will go.
