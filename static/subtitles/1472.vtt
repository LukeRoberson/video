00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:37.969
The allure of distant lands, mysterious, exotic, for centuries men have sought them for wealth, power, and adventure.

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:45.969
But others have sought distant lands for a noble purpose, as fields in which to proclaim the good news of God's kingdom.

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:47.969
Jesus told his disciples,

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.969
You will be witnesses of me to the most distant part of the earth.

00:00:51.969 --> 00:01:04.980
In imitation of the early apostles, a few courageous men and women early in the 20th century took the good news to remote corners of the world.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.349
Edwin Skinner preached in the subcontinent of India.

00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:16.659
W.R. Brown's work in West Africa earned him the nickname Bible Brown.

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:27.040
And Katie Paul, working alone, witnessed in mining camps, company towns, and sheep ranches throughout the Republic of Chile.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:35.379
Thus, by the early 1940s, a limited amount of missionary work was being done.

00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:41.329
But vast areas of the world had not yet received a witness.

00:01:41.329 --> 00:02:03.310
How could this good news be spread to the ends of the earth?

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:10.099
In September 1942, the world is at war.

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:19.099
In sharp contrast, peace-loving Christians attend the New World Theocratic Assembly held Earthwide in 85 cities.

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:28.099
At the main city, Cleveland, Ohio, USA, the president of the Watchtower Society, Nathan Nor, delivers the talk, Peace.

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:35.099
Can it last? He explains a startling Bible prophecy that was in the midst of fulfillment.

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:41.099
Many in attendance expect the then-raging war to climax in God's battle of Armageddon.

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:46.099
To them, the words of Nathan Nor come as a surprise.

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:53.099
This international war is not the battle of the great day of God Almighty.

00:02:53.099 --> 00:03:03.780
Before Armageddon comes, the scriptures show a peace must come.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.099
Plans are made to take advantage of the anticipated peace period.

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:16.099
I was Brother Nor's secretary, and the governing body was the board of directors in those days,

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:24.099
and the board of directors had the meeting, and they talked about the program of education that Brother Nor had in mind.

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.099
The result?

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:33.099
I was one of three that received a special invitation to see Brother Nor at his office.

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:45.099
Brother Keller and brother Maxwell Friend and myself giving astounding news that the governing body had decided to open up a missionary school.

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:51.099
This missionary school was given the biblical name, Gillian.

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.099
There was something to use, that building.

00:03:54.099 --> 00:04:04.099
It was a nice place to have studies, it's quiet, fresh air, very healthy surroundings, so they could concentrate on their studies.

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:12.099
Confidential invitations to the first class were extended by letter to 100 full-time ministers in the United States.

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:19.100
I was working with a group of sisters, special pioneering, five of us.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.100
We had one mailbox. We'd go and get our mail, of course, every day.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:31.100
And three of us got three long, beautiful envelopes from the White Star Bible and Track Society.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:37.100
We've immediately sat down and read our letters, and then we couldn't say another word to each other.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:46.100
Because in the letter we're instructions to discuss this invitation to this new school of Gillian, only with Jehovah.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.100
Mildred Simkins received such a letter.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.100
Please bring your birth certificate or equivalent with you.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.100
Do not plan on returning to your home after you complete the course.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.100
For no doubt you will go direct from Gillian to your new assignment.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:10.100
We filled out the application and sent it into the society.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.100
And once later we got our invitation for Gillian.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.100
Well, we still didn't feel we were worthy of it.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.100
But we sold the car and the trailer.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.100
Said goodbye to everybody because we never thought we'd get back to see them again.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.100
I just went home to see my mother.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.100
And all my clothes fit into an overnight bag.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:40.100
And I had a carton with all the society's books from my library that I put into a little cardboard suitcase

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.100
and took my overnight bag with an extra dress or two.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.100
And that was it. That's all the preparation there was.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.100
Brother Nart showed us around the farm.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:55.100
We realized that would be our home for five months.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:01.100
And there would be peace there in a war-torn world at that time.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:07.100
The dedication of the school took place on February 1, 1943.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:15.100
During the operation of the first class, several patterns were set for future classes.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.100
Very active and humorous.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:28.100
But at the same time, very serious and inquired of deeper things pertaining to Bible prophecies and the Bible itself.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.100
I didn't know what to do. I was awestricking.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:38.100
I thought, how little I know what am I going to do?

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:43.100
But they didn't mind. They helped us.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:48.100
And there were so kind all of our instructions were so loving.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:53.100
In fact, I'll tell you where the friend used to call us, his precious guinea pigs.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.100
They were working with us and we were working along with them.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:01.100
Whatever, you know, was presented to us to do. We were just willing.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.100
We just all 100 willing people. That's what it was.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:11.540
There were examinations and those who passed were granted a diploma.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:21.540
In its first 50 years, the school graduated 6,707 students sending them to 187 lands.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:29.540
One thing that sticks very clearly in my mind was a statement by brother Frederick Franz when he said that this is not an experiment.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:36.540
He said, we know that the good news has to be preached and that is the purpose of this school of Gillian.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:41.540
As long as this time, this peace period after the war would be going,

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:50.540
why we would be doing this work of missionaries and we would reach the world if possible.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.540
Gillian is still training missionaries.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:08:01.870
What was it like to be a member of the 95th class on the school's 50th anniversary?

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:08.430
We'd like to welcome your students of the 95th class.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:13.430
And today, we'd like to have what we would call an orientation session.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:18.430
The students come to the school between the ages of 21 and 40.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:22.430
They must have good physical health and stamina, speak English well,

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:26.430
and have been full-time ministers at least two years.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:32.429
They're going to leave their family, they're going to leave their friends, they're going to leave their home,

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:37.429
they're going to leave their language, their climate, the food, everything is all gone behind.

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:40.429
They don't even know what kind of they're going to get into.

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:44.429
They don't even think about that because they have a purpose, a goal.

00:08:44.429 --> 00:08:48.429
And that's why it's such a joy to be a teacher.

00:08:48.429 --> 00:08:53.429
You don't have to motivate these kids here. They're ready to go.

00:08:53.429 --> 00:09:02.429
The students tour the Gillian Library and learn where their 175 written tests and reports will be returned to them.

00:09:02.429 --> 00:09:09.429
In a classroom, they are greeted by stacks of books that will help them through the next five months.

00:09:09.429 --> 00:09:13.429
Brother Norther, this is Ionis President, one of the students to have an education in the Bible.

00:09:13.429 --> 00:09:21.429
And he wanted them to cover every book of the Bible and to put as much time on each book of the Bible as five months would allow.

00:09:21.429 --> 00:09:26.429
And as we go through, we assign certain verses or chapters for research,

00:09:26.429 --> 00:09:34.429
and then the students can go to the society's indexes, look up information, and present that in class.

00:09:34.429 --> 00:09:40.429
So that, truly, by the time they finish Gillian school, the Bible really has been their textbook.

00:09:40.429 --> 00:09:47.379
On the evening of their first official day enrolled in the school,

00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:50.379
the students will introduce themselves to the Bethel family.

00:09:50.379 --> 00:09:55.379
It's a time for reflection and even some humor.

00:09:55.379 --> 00:10:04.129
One of those many blessings I have to say is meeting my present life montage.

00:10:08.129 --> 00:10:11.129
I mean by that she'll always be my wife.

00:10:16.029 --> 00:10:19.029
I came to love Jehovah myself as I was a young child.

00:10:19.029 --> 00:10:24.029
My grandmother used to relate Bible stories to me as I was growing up.

00:10:24.029 --> 00:10:27.029
I asked the man, I said, do you honestly believe that?

00:10:27.029 --> 00:10:29.029
And he said, well, yes, all of Jehovah's Witnesses do.

00:10:29.029 --> 00:10:32.029
It's what the Bible says, and we take it as the word of God.

00:10:32.029 --> 00:10:36.029
I was immediately convinced that I wanted to study with him.

00:10:36.029 --> 00:10:40.029
He was the first one that I had ever met that really believed the Bible,

00:10:40.029 --> 00:10:42.029
and I wanted to be a part of that.

00:10:43.029 --> 00:10:48.029
Can you imagine that I have had long hair,

00:10:48.029 --> 00:10:56.320
big motorcycle, and leather jacket?

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.320
I was raised a good Catholic.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.320
He asked me a whole bunch of questions why.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.320
Why did I go to church? Why did I celebrate the holidays?

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.320
But of course I didn't know the answers.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:11.320
That made me start asking him about Jehovah's Witnesses and what he was being taught.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:15.320
I first came in contact with the truth from my two best friends.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.320
We three together were very keen surfers.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.320
Surfing was our entire lifestyle.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:25.320
Well, unknowns to me, they started studying the Bible,

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:29.320
and in time, one of them came to tell me about the beautiful new system

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.320
in terms that would capture my interest.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.320
Perfect surf every day, he promised.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.320
One of my favorite scriptures I know will come true,

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.320
which is Malachi 310, which says,

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:49.320
test me out, please, in this respect Jehovah's Witnesses has said,

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.320
whether I shall not open to you the floodgates of the heavens

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.320
and actually empty out upon you a blessing until there is no more want.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.320
Thank you for letting me be here.

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:05.870
The score starts in earnest.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.870
Using different styles and teaching aids,

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:13.870
principal instructors take the students on a virtual verse by verse discussion of the Bible.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:20.870
Jesus want people to identify him as the Christ.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.870
That it had ten horns.

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:30.870
Now, the ten horns seemed to picture all of the pieces

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:33.870
into which the Roman Empire was eventually divided.

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:41.870
Let's have two reasons why it is not admissible for a prophet to be destroyed outside Jerusalem.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:47.870
So here the Anglo-American world power would fight against the remnant,

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:49.870
see the holy ones.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.870
Well, we've enjoyed this session with you very much

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:55.870
and we appreciate all your comments or observations,

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:57.870
but that will end our session for today.

00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:59.870
Thank you, class dismissed.

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:07.600
It's like an accumulation of experience that's just bestowed upon you.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.600
If we were to add up all the years of experience that these brothers have,

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:18.190
and then they just give it to you, it's unbelievable.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:20.190
To benefit from the course,

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:24.190
Gilead student studied three hours every night.

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:30.190
Come morning, the student may find himself presenting a report.

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:36.190
Well, another aspect of the high-prese garment that we want to talk about is the blue sleeveless coat.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:43.190
What's interesting is that the bottom of this coat was a handsome fringe of bells and pomegranates,

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:51.190
and taken in its entirety, this woven garment pictured Jesus' trunus and faithfulness toward Jehovah.

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:58.210
They have a work assignment during a portion of every school day,

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:13.210
and they keep their preaching skills sharp with regular participation in the ministry.

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:18.210
A person who becomes a missionary should be one of those who just loves the field service,

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:20.210
because that's all they do.

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:24.210
140 hours a month, they spend preaching and teaching.

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:28.210
He's going to adjust to his new assignment, although it's very different,

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:32.210
because he loves the people there, although they're different.

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:36.210
And because he loves people, he'll be able to get along with his fellow missionaries

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:40.210
and peace and unity in the missionary home.

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:44.210
About midway through the course, a very special day comes for the 95th class.

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:50.740
The countries where the students will be sent have been selected.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:55.740
This is the day when we hand out the assignments to all of these students,

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.740
and they wonder, just, what is it going to be?

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.740
Morning, we knew that we were going to get our assignment.

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:04.740
We went down to morning worship, and then we had to line up,

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:08.740
and we were waiting to get our assignment, and my stomach was churning,

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:10.740
and I felt really sick.

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:15.740
Sick with excitement, as well as the fact that you knew that whatever brother Jaros said,

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:19.740
the next sentence that came out of his mouth would determine the rest of your life.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:23.740
Well, we're going to send him not too far away into the Caribbean area,

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:27.740
the Dominican Republic, and they're going to join another couple

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:31.740
that is being sent to Taiwan. It's to Chile.

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:36.429
We were just so excited about going.

00:15:36.429 --> 00:15:39.429
We were just when we came to Gillette, it was anywhere in the world,

00:15:39.429 --> 00:15:43.429
and we felt like no matter where we were sent, you know,

00:15:43.429 --> 00:15:46.429
we'd be happy to jump into it, and so since it is Chile,

00:15:46.429 --> 00:15:49.429
it's such a wonderful place, it's like better than our dream.

00:15:49.429 --> 00:15:52.429
Well, a good place is Estonia.

00:15:52.429 --> 00:16:02.809
To the Leeward Islands, Lasotho, Argentina, in Honduras, Cambodia.

00:16:02.809 --> 00:16:23.950
I have a little anxiety.

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:27.950
Will we stay healthy, and will everything works out good?

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:30.950
Will we have the opportunity to continue our service or not?

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:34.950
But we will turn to Jehovah and ask for him and his help

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:36.950
and support in this regard.

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:40.950
About this time, a class photograph is taken.

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:43.950
All right. So close your eyes.

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:47.950
One, two, three. Open. Smile.

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:50.950
Good.

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:57.710
And the classwork continues with offline.

00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:01.710
One of the great blessings of Gillette is to be able to listen to lectures

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:04.710
given by members of the governing body.

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:10.710
What is the proof of a good teacher, brother?

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:12.710
The things the student does.

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:15.710
You know, get results from your student, not for yourself,

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:18.710
but get good results from your student, so on.

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:24.710
That the effect of God's word on our mind can have the same effect

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.710
if we let it.

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:31.710
This is the point. If we get into its field of influence.

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:36.710
But we've got to do that, and it means effort in our part.

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:41.710
So we have to see the organization and our position and our place in it.

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:43.710
And then we are going to be able to explain it to other people.

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:46.710
If you don't see it, how can you explain it?

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:50.710
You can't teach someone else something that you don't understand.

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:55.710
Make the truth come alive in you, then you will come alive.

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:58.710
And you will find joy in your life.

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:03.710
And you will find joy because you will know that you're associating

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:05.710
with your God, Jehovah.

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:10.710
You will feel that you're walking hand in hand with Him.

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:16.710
Most of them seem to be impressed at the end of it all

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:20.710
with the humility of the members of the governing body.

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:25.710
Brothers are very warm and friendly, down to earth, very human.

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:30.710
And this makes a tremendous impression on the students as they leave here

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:36.710
that there is a loving, caring, kind organization that is backing them up.

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:42.890
As the course nears its conclusion, the students find time

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:45.890
for a bit of relaxation and reflection.

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:49.890
What I think I've gotten out of it is I've gotten a heritage,

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:51.890
a deeper heritage into the truth.

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:55.890
You get this feeling that these are the people that have worked hard.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:56.890
They've toiled.

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:57.890
And that's the family.

00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:59.890
But now they're handing the torch to you.

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:01.890
And they're saying run hard with it.

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:03.890
You can keep the work going.

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:08.890
You'll never ever get another opportunity to spend at least eight hours a day

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:12.890
without having to worry about anything else just to concentrate on building

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:15.890
yourself up spiritually and building your faith up.

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:20.890
You'll never ever get another chance to have the time or the opportunity to do that.

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:23.890
And I wouldn't have swapped it for the world.

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:29.410
Graduation day comes quickly.

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:34.980
The Jersey City Assembly Hall fills with Bethel family members,

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:40.289
close family of the students, and special guests.

00:19:40.289 --> 00:19:42.289
We say good morning.

00:19:42.289 --> 00:19:53.240
This is the happy day of graduation for the 95th class of the Gilead School.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.240
This is the final step.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:59.240
What awaits them are envelopes with their diplomas and later,

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.240
one way tickets to their assignments.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:09.240
You're going to 18 countries that has a total population of approximately 170 million people.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:13.240
Obviously, you will initially be learners.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.240
Who are the experts?

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.240
The brothers who are already there.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:23.240
Teach yourselves and others too to love Jehovah with all your hearts,

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:28.240
so mind and mind and your neighbor as yourself.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:32.240
Do this, and you'll find that your joy will be great,

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:37.240
and your reward of everlasting life will be made sure.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:41.900
After listening to a program of encouraging talks,

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:48.900
they make their way to the stage for their last moments as Gilead students.

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.900
Very soon, they will be Gilead graduates,

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:56.900
and the 95th class will be sent to the ends of the year.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.900
It's when they walk across the platform

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:04.900
and get their envelope with the diploma in it.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.900
And we know what that means, and this is it.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.900
They've got it, they've made it, they've got through.

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.900
The next stop now is their assignment,

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:15.900
and we know that isn't stop.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.900
Really, it's just a beginning for them,

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:22.900
and it's just like part of the family is leaving you.

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:25.900
You just can't escape that.

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:28.900
It's a remarkable testimony to faith,

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.900
and to confidence in the organization,

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:32.900
to see what young people are doing.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.900
They sacrifice everything that the world can offer.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.900
They've devoted themselves to this one purpose

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:41.900
of being able to qualify to be a Gilead.

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.900
Now, to study and to qualify to go out

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.900
and give themselves in further sacrifice.

00:21:47.900 --> 00:22:37.690
Yeah, you have to love them, but what they're doing.

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:46.960
What is life as a missionary like?

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.960
It's better just three countries

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:58.009
where missionaries have been active for many years.

00:22:58.009 --> 00:23:00.009
We didn't really know what to expect.

00:23:00.009 --> 00:23:02.009
At this point, we were ready and willing to go

00:23:02.009 --> 00:23:07.180
wherever Jehovah would send us.

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:11.180
It was a little strange, but we were really positive

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:14.180
and prepared because of the training of Gilead,

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:16.180
especially the part missionary service.

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:18.180
That's where it trains you to anything,

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:26.170
and you were full of fire, and you talk to anyone.

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:28.170
You come out with a view of a stress

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:30.170
when we were young at Gilead.

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:32.170
This is a one-way ticket.

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:33.170
And this is your assignment.

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:35.170
This is where you're going to be until

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:38.170
Jehovah brings a new system.

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:41.170
Missionaries around the world begin their day

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:43.170
with a discussion of a Bible text.

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:49.170
We want to give the beginning

00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:51.170
to our consideration of the text of the day

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:52.170
or this morning.

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:56.170
Today, we're going to start the discussion

00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:58.170
and start the discussion.

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:13.400
We're going to start the discussion today.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.400
By whatever means of transportation,

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:22.599
the entire day will be spent in preaching.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.200
One of the first challenges a missionary must overcome

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.200
is learning the local language.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.200
Can't first word is tone-e,

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.200
and it means to agree.

00:24:54.799 --> 00:24:55.799
After being a Gilead,

00:24:55.799 --> 00:24:57.799
we were taking in all this wonderful knowledge,

00:24:57.799 --> 00:24:59.799
and then they come to Taiwan

00:24:59.799 --> 00:25:01.799
and can't speak the language.

00:25:01.799 --> 00:25:03.799
Chinese is very difficult,

00:25:03.799 --> 00:25:05.799
and so I found it very frustrating.

00:25:05.799 --> 00:25:07.799
I know I couldn't express myself

00:25:07.799 --> 00:25:10.799
at least a year or more before I could really start

00:25:10.799 --> 00:25:12.799
to carry on a conversation with people.

00:25:12.799 --> 00:25:14.799
But then when you're limited with the language,

00:25:14.799 --> 00:25:15.799
it's just not possible.

00:25:15.799 --> 00:25:17.799
So then you have to work extra hard

00:25:17.799 --> 00:25:19.799
to know how to put it.

00:25:19.799 --> 00:25:21.799
In a simple way that you can understand what you're saying,

00:25:21.799 --> 00:25:23.799
and that the person can understand what you're saying,

00:25:23.799 --> 00:25:25.799
and you dread them to ask you any questions,

00:25:25.799 --> 00:25:27.799
because you have no idea what they ask you.

00:25:27.799 --> 00:25:29.799
I think I think that it does a lot of things.

00:25:29.799 --> 00:25:31.799
The whole world,

00:25:31.799 --> 00:25:34.799
I don't know if you're in Sweden.

00:25:34.799 --> 00:25:35.799
Yeah, yeah.

00:25:35.799 --> 00:25:36.799
I can't say I don't just believe it is.

00:25:36.799 --> 00:25:37.799
Yeah, okay.

00:25:37.799 --> 00:25:38.799
See.

00:25:38.799 --> 00:25:40.799
Okay, I said Yamato.

00:25:40.799 --> 00:25:41.799
Osama is pretty good,

00:25:41.799 --> 00:25:43.799
and her question is practical.

00:25:43.799 --> 00:25:48.779
Do you live in the conditions

00:25:48.779 --> 00:25:49.779
that we see here?

00:25:49.779 --> 00:25:51.779
Where is Madan?

00:25:51.779 --> 00:25:53.779
When it's here, it's going to pass out.

00:25:53.779 --> 00:25:55.779
Here, there's hardly any fortata

00:25:55.779 --> 00:25:57.779
where Lerence is going to pass out.

00:25:59.779 --> 00:26:04.950
Missionary life is truly rewarding,

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:08.950
but it brings its own special challenges.

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:11.950
Like we're in a country where malaria runs high,

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:15.950
and any sickness is a handicap to the world.

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:18.950
So when we get sick,

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:20.950
it doesn't make us feel good naturally,

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:23.950
and it can become discouraging.

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:24.950
But as a whole,

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:26.950
we see how Jova brings us through.

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:28.950
We get the needed medicine.

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:29.950
We have time.

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:31.950
We're back on the road again.

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:43.460
In order to be happy as a missionary,

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.460
one shouldn't be fussy,

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.460
one shouldn't be afraid of dirt,

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:49.460
of smells, of mosquitoes,

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.460
of all these little beasts,

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:55.460
and also the, let's say, rats and mice and all this.

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:57.460
I mean, you just can't avoid it

00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:03.529
because you're in the tropics.

00:27:03.529 --> 00:27:04.529
Taking turns.

00:27:04.529 --> 00:27:06.529
Some missionaries will be assigned

00:27:06.529 --> 00:27:08.529
to shop in local markets for food

00:27:08.529 --> 00:27:14.980
and other essentials needed at the missionary home.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:21.980
We have to wash our vegetables nicely in the kitchen

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:24.980
and put that in the bleach water

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:28.980
for 20 minutes to kill the amoeba.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.980
But after a while, you just get used to it.

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:40.930
The break at Midday finds missionaries

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:43.930
back at home for a family meal.

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.980
People are very friendly and practically at each door,

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:20.980
you can talk with somebody.

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:22.980
We sit down at nearly every door.

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:24.980
We meet very few people who say,

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:26.980
I do not believe in God.

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:28.980
They are a people who, as soon as you ask,

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:31.980
can we talk about God, reply, of course.

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:39.980
You see people responding to the message

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:41.980
and you're able to share the kingdom,

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:43.980
truths with them, study with them.

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:45.980
See them make changes.

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:49.980
And it's so, it's fulfilling when you see them

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:52.980
learning how to thank Jehovah.

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:56.980
How wonderful Jehovah God is when they learn that

00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:01.980
and that he is the center of all true worship and admiration.

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:04.980
It just swells your heart.

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:08.980
Most missionaries preach in cities and towns,

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.980
but sometimes they witness in more primitive territory.

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:14.980
They find good results.

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:19.980
The Ministry is good.

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:21.980
I wouldn't want to change with anybody.

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:23.980
It's really good.

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:24.980
People are friendly.

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:26.980
They are hospitable.

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:28.980
When you go from house to house,

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.980
you can sit down in general, they listen.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.980
And it's very easy to have studies.

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:36.980
I have more studies than I can take care of.

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:57.700
When we had our memorial,

00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:02.700
1,854 just for our congregation.

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:04.700
Besides that, in our territory,

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:08.700
we had something like 29 baptized just from our congregation

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:09.700
for one assembly.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:12.700
And in four visits of the circuit overseer,

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:15.700
the congregation divided three times.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:18.700
Thank you.

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:19.700
Hello.

00:30:34.329 --> 00:30:37.329
That is not to say that all Bible studies come into the truth,

00:30:37.329 --> 00:30:40.329
but at least in conducting several studies,

00:30:40.329 --> 00:30:42.329
you have the feeling of working thoroughly,

00:30:42.329 --> 00:30:45.329
of giving a thorough witness to all these people.

00:30:45.329 --> 00:30:48.329
And that makes us very happy.

00:30:48.329 --> 00:31:00.490
Chores around the home are part of the regular assignment.

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:02.490
The missionary life has got it all.

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:05.490
You feel that you're using your life to the full

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:07.490
in Jehovah's service.

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:10.490
You learn so much living the way we do.

00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:11.490
To be a missionary,

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:13.490
you can't be afraid of work.

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:15.490
Because there's a lot of physical work

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:17.490
in the missionary home to keep it clean.

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:19.490
And also, there's lots of work

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:22.490
in the congregation helping brothers and sisters.

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:25.490
And especially in the field,

00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:28.490
there's enormous changes that people have to make.

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:30.490
So you really have to work hard

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:32.490
in helping people to come in the truth.

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:35.490
Missionaries have the privilege of teaching

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:39.490
many people the truth it leads to everlasting life.

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:42.490
This is the grandest reward.

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:48.490
When you feel that love from your brothers and sisters

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:50.490
and from the interested people

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:53.490
that you have the privilege to study with them,

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:55.490
it's just wonderful feeling.

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:58.490
I studied with Segundo and his wife Margarita.

00:31:58.490 --> 00:32:01.490
They studied with sister Anito Joa

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:04.490
and she studied with Margarita.

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:07.490
So we have one, two, three, four

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:10.490
or a generation.

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:14.490
I believe that I do better than any

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:17.490
medical doctor here that saves the life

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:20.490
because he can save the life for about five, ten, twenty years.

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:23.490
But if I can help somebody to accept the truth,

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:26.490
I can help them to live forever.

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:29.490
What better thing can you do?

00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:31.490
A very full day of work

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:34.490
will likely conclude with spiritual meetings

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:37.490
or personal and family study.

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:40.490
You go to bed tired, but satisfied

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:44.490
because you feel you did what you were supposed to do.

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:48.490
Even though they come from distant lands,

00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:54.059
missionaries have found new places to call home.

00:32:54.059 --> 00:32:57.059
My family is here, my work is here,

00:32:57.059 --> 00:33:01.059
all my friends, all my children are here.

00:33:01.059 --> 00:33:06.059
Now I am determined to stay here.

00:33:06.059 --> 00:33:09.059
And it's our desire to remain as missionaries

00:33:09.059 --> 00:33:11.059
as long as Jehovah permits,

00:33:11.059 --> 00:33:13.059
our health permits,

00:33:13.059 --> 00:33:17.059
and the governments on foreign soil permits.

00:33:17.059 --> 00:33:19.059
It's a career,

00:33:19.059 --> 00:33:21.059
it's a way of life for us,

00:33:21.059 --> 00:33:24.059
and we like to remain forever.

00:33:24.059 --> 00:33:33.549
What has been the accomplishment of thousands of missionaries

00:33:33.549 --> 00:33:40.650
planting seeds of kingdom truth around the world?

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:42.650
Consider just two examples.

00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:44.650
First, Japan,

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:55.069
a country steeped in the Shinto and Buddhist religions,

00:33:55.069 --> 00:33:57.069
it did not seem at first to be a likely location

00:33:57.069 --> 00:34:00.069
for large harvests of Christians.

00:34:00.069 --> 00:34:04.069
In fact, prior to the arrival of missionaries in 1949,

00:34:04.069 --> 00:34:08.070
the good news of God's kingdom was almost unknown.

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:11.070
We looked at those people,

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:14.070
and we knew at the time that only a handful

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:17.070
maybe half a dozen kingdom publishers active in the country

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:18.070
we wondered,

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:21.070
well, will anything ever come out of this?

00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:23.070
In time,

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:26.070
more missionaries would come.

00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:27.070
Over the years,

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:30.070
some 168 would serve there.

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:33.070
Listen to Matsui Ishii,

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:36.070
one of the handful of Jehovah's Witnesses preaching in Japan

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:40.320
for the arrival of Gilead missionaries.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:48.320
Their influence was truly marvelous.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.320
Before the war in Japan,

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.320
there were no meetings or assemblies.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.320
We never got together.

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:58.320
We didn't study the Bible together.

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:01.320
So when the missionary brothers and sisters came,

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.320
meetings became regular.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.320
Conventions were started,

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:08.320
and all sorts of things got organized,

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:11.320
so that we, who'd been blind up until then,

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:14.320
were brought to life spiritually.

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.320
Those early missionaries found a zealous people,

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.320
enthusiastic to learn.

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:30.320
Japan was a fertile field, ready for harvesting.

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:34.320
In the first 10 years in Japan,

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:38.320
and we had up to 60 missionaries in the country by that time,

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.320
we got just 1,000 publishers.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:44.320
I remember when we reached that 1,000 mark

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:47.320
after 10 years of hard work.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:49.320
And now, in Japan,

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:54.320
they get 1,000 publishers increase every month.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:57.320
You talk about Jehovah's Speeding the Work Up.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:01.320
Well, that means it's been speeded up 120 times

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:08.219
since those early days of missionary work.

00:36:08.219 --> 00:36:14.530
Now consider what Kili Admissionaries have accomplished

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:18.530
in the vast country of Brazil.

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:21.530
Though long dominated by the Catholic religion,

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:24.530
Brazil, too, proved to be a receptive field

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:27.530
for seeds of kingdom truth.

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:29.530
A graduate of the first class,

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:32.530
remembers the daunting task of organizing the preaching work

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:35.530
in a land so vast.

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:39.530
The publishers were thinly spread all over the whole country,

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:42.530
even though there was less than 400.

00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:45.530
When I came with my partner, Harry Black,

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:52.530
there was 394 publishers a peak in the year of 1945.

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:55.530
The early missionary shared in a battle

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:58.530
to legalize the watchtower society.

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:01.530
Only after many years did their efforts triumph.

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:05.530
Nevertheless, the preaching work went on.

00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:09.420
The branch committee coordinator in Brazil

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:14.420
was taught the kingdom truth by a Kili Admissionary.

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:17.420
He explains why such missionaries produced good results

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:20.420
in his native land.

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:26.420
It's precisely the same nowadays in the congregation.

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:30.420
If a student has a study with a brother who is weak,

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.420
his progress is slower.

00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:36.420
On the other hand, if he happens to have a good teacher,

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:39.420
his progress will probably be faster.

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:42.420
The missionaries contribute to more rapid progress

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:45.420
without them that would certainly take much more time

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:47.420
in the training of the brothers

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:51.420
so that they could assume leadership of the work.

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:54.420
So, it's because of the good news

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:59.420
that the message of truth has continued to prosper and grow.

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:03.420
The result?

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:08.420
Today, more than 360,000 in Brazil witnessed to Jehovah's name.

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:11.420
And on the average, more than 60 new ones

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:18.190
are baptized every day.

00:38:26.079 --> 00:38:32.099
Similar success stories could be told in many other lands.

00:38:32.099 --> 00:38:36.099
For example, in Argentina, Mexico,

00:38:36.099 --> 00:38:40.099
Italy, and Nigeria.

00:38:40.099 --> 00:38:43.099
In 1993, the total number of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:38:43.099 --> 00:38:48.099
was 75 times what it had been in 1949.

00:38:48.099 --> 00:38:52.099
Worldwide, during the school's first 50 years,

00:38:52.099 --> 00:38:57.099
Jehovah's Witnesses grew from 129,000 to 4.7 million

00:38:57.099 --> 00:39:00.099
in 231 countries.

00:39:00.099 --> 00:39:05.110
Kili Admissionaries played a major part

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:09.110
in paving the way for that increase.

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:13.110
When Kili Ad was established more than 50 years ago,

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:17.110
vast areas of the earth had not been reached with the good news.

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:22.110
Today, millions still have not heard the message of salvation.

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:29.130
The missionary example encourages all young Christians

00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:32.130
to make the full-time preaching work their career.

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:38.719
It encourages those with family or other responsibilities

00:39:38.719 --> 00:39:42.719
to do their utmost, to reach out to others with the good news.

00:39:42.719 --> 00:39:48.510
In its new home in Patterson, New York,

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:53.510
Kili Ad will continue to fulfill its mandate to train new missionaries.

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:55.510
South Africa area.

00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:58.510
All dedicated Christians will continue to work

00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:00.510
with the missionary spirit.

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:03.510
To seek out the meek hearted until Jehovah says,

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:05.510
the work is done.

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:08.510
For more than 50 years,

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:13.510
Kili Ad has had an impact on the worldwide preaching work.

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:17.510
It continues to prepare young men and women for missionary service,

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:21.510
and it's wonderful to reflect on what they accomplish.

00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:25.510
Thanks to their efforts and with Jehovah's blessing,

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:29.510
great numbers in many lands continue to be helped

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:32.510
to gain the knowledge of the truth.

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:36.510
This is the legacy that Kili Ad is leaving behind.

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:40.510
It is something that will never be forgotten.
