WEBVTT

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.009
This symposium is about sharing the good news of peace.

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:11.730
What it privilege it is to help humble people find peace with Jehovah.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.730
At Ephesians 6.15, and describing our Christians' complete suit of arm,

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.769
it mentions our feet.

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:24.210
Now, back at that time, thinking of Roman soldiers, Paul knew that often they marched

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.050
for hundreds of miles on Roman highways, crisscrossing the empire.

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.770
So at Ephesians 6.15, he said this,

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:41.850
having your feet shod in readiness, in readiness to declare the good news of peace.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:50.240
Yes, ready to share the good news of peace on every suitable occasion.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:57.840
In this symposium, we'll discuss five ways to remain ready to preach and teach.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.960
We'd first like to discuss why it's important to maintain your zeal.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.560
Now, as an analogy, zeal has often been linked to fire.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.400
We even use expression, don't we?

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.239
He has a fiery zeal for his beliefs.

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:18.000
Well, what does a fiery zeal indicate?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.079
Please find Romans 1, 14, and 15, and here it does not actually use the word zeal,

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.879
but the sense of the word is evident.

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:29.599
You see, we're on fire, we're stoked up, we are ready.

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:30.560
Did you find it?

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.579
Romans 1, 14, and 15.

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.980
Both to Greeks and to foreigners, both to wise and to senseless ones,

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.659
I am a debtor.

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.659
So I am eager.

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:50.219
You see, ready with fiery zeal, eager to declare the good news.

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:53.739
Celicy evangelizers are eager to declare the good news.

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:55.019
They're on fire.

00:01:55.019 --> 00:02:00.719
They want others to find peace with Jehovah.

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.879
But is there something that can dampen that flame?

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:08.319
Something that could even extinguish the eager desire,

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:14.479
the readiness to find those who even unknowingly yearn for peace?

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:19.680
Yes, it can be difficult to remain eager with fiery zeal

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.520
when we face such problems as an unresponsive territory,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.520
criticism, or outright opposition to the work.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.000
And then there are the pressures of daily life.

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:37.360
Those issues can also be likened to a fire,

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.479
to destructive fires, like the wildfires that have

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:43.360
plagued the western part of the United States year after year.

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:49.199
Those problems can threaten our zeal and enthusiasm.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.490
So what can we do?

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.289
Well, there's an English expression that originates with firefighters.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.449
The expression is to fight fire with fire.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.330
In the path of a raging wildfire, one technique is to ignite a controlled fire.

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:12.169
That controlled fire consumes combustible materials.

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:15.370
So when the wildfire advances to that point,

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.129
there's no fuel left and the wildfire goes out.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.569
Fight fire with fire.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.370
Keep your zeal for the ministry burning brightly.

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:29.050
And now please find 1st November the 416.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:35.280
If our zeal fades, the flame smolders,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.439
we might miss out on opportunities to help others to gain life,

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:41.680
a life of peace with God.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.280
Look at 1st November the 416 with me.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.810
It says, pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.090
You see, the flame, the temperature, pay attention to your zeal and teaching.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.969
It says, persevere in these things.

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:03.610
For by doing this, you'll say both yourself and those who listen to you.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.849
Yes, share the good news of peace with zeal.

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:15.289
Now in the following video, note how a couple realized that the flame had gone out.

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:18.410
They still had some glowing embers left.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:24.970
But they now find a way to fan the coals and regain their fiery zeal.

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.759
I don't remember when our routine service day became so...

00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:09.579
Well, routine, our zeal wasn't what it used to be.

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:23.000
We're finally starting to notice.

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:28.439
Not everyone wants to listen.

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:31.560
We just didn't want to be the reason.

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:46.040
It didn't take much research to find great ideas and set a few simple goals.

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:51.870
Like working with those who encourage us,

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.850
with biota and ami, we're always talking about how we can reach the heart.

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:02.970
We got back to basics.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:04.730
Be friendly.

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:07.360
Listen.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.199
Let the conversation progress naturally.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:20.750
Try to share an appealing scriptural thought and keep trying.

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:27.000
Our zeal can attract an honest person to the truth.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:40.170
In the video, what wildfires or problems did the couple face that sucked the oxygen out of their

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:47.449
ministry? Well, the four we mentioned earlier, it seems the couple's zeal was waning because of

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.970
seemingly unresponsive territory.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.970
And as tired as the husband looked in that first scene, the pressures of daily life

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.810
might have been having a toll on him.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:05.129
So how did they come to realize they needed to fight fire with fire?

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:09.449
Do you remember their kitchen table talk?

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:14.250
The husband mused that not everyone wants to listen.

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:19.930
But then he added, we just didn't want to be the reason.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.089
You see, the reason for them not listening.

00:07:22.089 --> 00:07:24.569
They decided to fight fire with fire.

00:07:25.209 --> 00:07:31.370
They reignited their own controlled fire of zeal to counteract the problems they were succumbing to.

00:07:33.129 --> 00:07:35.129
Well, what were some of the techniques they used?

00:07:36.569 --> 00:07:38.810
The first was to pray to Jehovah.

00:07:40.329 --> 00:07:44.009
Could it be the husband borrowed the words of Romans 12-11 in this prayer?

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:50.730
Yes, he may have asked Jehovah to help him as a couple to be a glow with the spirit.

00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:58.730
Do you remember he said earlier, I don't remember when our routine service day became so,

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:06.970
well, routine, fight the wildfire by again becoming a glow with the spirit.

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:13.209
And sure that any lack of response is not due to our lack luster.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.959
Well, what else did you notice they did to rekindle their zeal?

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.480
They did some research, looking for suggestions to invigorate their ministry.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:31.519
Yes, and regular Bible study helps us to remember why we endure and the disciple making work.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.080
For example, review Jesus' attitude toward the ministry.

00:08:36.879 --> 00:08:40.320
The apostles bold witnessing despite fiery opposition.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:47.279
The disposition of Paul, Aquila and Priscilla, Stephen and other Bible characters.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.879
These can infuse us with similar zeal.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.139
Next, keep your ministry fresh.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:58.539
Well, what does that mean?

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:03.019
Instead of having a number of phone calls that go unanswered,

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.980
which is similar to having no one at home when in the door-to-door work,

00:09:09.019 --> 00:09:13.340
change the time of day for witnessing when more people are home.

00:09:15.549 --> 00:09:17.950
Participate in various forms with ministry.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:24.190
And you know, ironically, the pandemic, more or less for some of us who were staunch,

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:30.190
door-to-door witnesses, could branch out. We tried phone witnessing, letter writing.

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:36.110
And now we have a variety of preaching activities, and this can keep us more fully engaged and

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:42.220
enthused. And did you notice what the couple in the video said as a goal?

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:49.019
Periodically, they decided in advance to share in the ministry with someone specific.

00:09:50.139 --> 00:09:55.820
And then they determined to talk about encouraging subjects when in-between calls, whether in phone

00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:05.230
witnessing or in the public ministry. Jehovah values our work in the ministry, regardless of the

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:11.789
response we receive. He reached 610. You familiar with that? Of course you are.

00:10:12.669 --> 00:10:18.590
But it does not say Jehovah does not forget the number of return visits you make.

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:22.590
It does not say he does not forget how many Bible studies you conduct.

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:30.990
No, it says he does not forget your work, your effort, and the love you showed for his name.

00:10:33.549 --> 00:10:38.830
RZL for the ministry demonstrates that we have a deep love for Jehovah and Jesus.

00:10:40.509 --> 00:10:46.830
If like the couple in the video, you detect that your routine of service is becoming, well,

00:10:47.789 --> 00:10:57.230
very routine, then fight fire with fire. Maintain that fire is yield. Be ready to share the good news

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:04.759
of peace. Brother Robert Sarenko, a helper of the writing committee, will now present the next

00:11:04.759 --> 00:11:16.840
talk of the symposium. Be ready to share the good news of peace. Prepare well.
