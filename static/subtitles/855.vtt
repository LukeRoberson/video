WEBVTT

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:06.740
Well, we certainly have learned much during the past few years regarding Jehovah's mercy, haven't we?

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:10.179
In fact, even just today we've

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.100
highlighted how we now have a broader understanding of Jehovah's mercy during the Great Tribulation.

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:20.500
The May 2024 Watchtower stated this,

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.539
even after the Great Tribulation starts, it is possible that some who see the destruction of

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.179
Babylon the Great will recall that Jehovah's witnesses had long spoken of this event.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.859
Might some who see these events have a change of heart and of quote? Well, it could be.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:49.460
And if so, we'll be happy for them, won't we? Then there's Jehovah's mercy and welcoming

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.380
repentant ones back into the congregation. Again, we've been highlighting this and properly

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.979
saw what a beautiful thing. The August 2024 Watchtower stated,

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:09.140
Jehovah does not condone unrepentant wrongdoing. However, he does not turn his back on wrongdoers.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.219
He wants them to return. Jehovah's feelings toward unrepentant wrongdoers or pardon me,

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:22.500
repentant wrongdoers are expressed at Hosea 14 and verse 4. And he says towards such repentant ones

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.459
here, quoted in the article, I will heal their unfaithfulness, I will love them of my own free will

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.459
because my anger has turned away. The article continued, what a strong incentive for elders to

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:45.540
respond to any sign of repentance. And what a strong incentive for those who have left Jehovah

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:53.939
to return without delay. End of quote. Well, throughout the Scriptures, we see Jehovah's warm

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:01.700
appeal to wrongdoers urging them to repent. At Zechariah 1 and verse 3, we read that Jehovah told his

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:09.379
prophet, say to them, this is what Jehovah of Army says, return to me, declares Jehovah of

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:18.659
Army's and I will return to you. But does our increased understanding of Jehovah's mercy here

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:26.659
mean that his righteous and just standards have somehow been changed? Also in line with our theme,

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.219
what thing should we properly tear down and what thing should we desire to build up?

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:42.580
According to Ecclesiastes chapter 3 and verse 3, it's scriptural to do both as needed. Along with

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:49.939
the opening comment from verse 1, verse 3 reads in part, there is an appointed time for everything,

00:02:50.580 --> 00:03:00.500
a time to tear down and a time to build up. So then to answer our questions, let's examine

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:10.020
Jehovah's love of righteousness, justice, and mercy. At Psalm 33 and verse 5, the inspired writer

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:17.939
highlights that Jehovah loves righteousness and justice. Also, Jesus' words recorded at Matthew 9

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:27.379
in verse 13, highlight that Jehovah wants mercy, not sacrifice. Since Jehovah loves each of

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:34.659
these qualities, how does he balance what he righteously chooses to tear down with what he

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:43.460
mercifully chooses to build up? He does so by knowing how these qualities work together. Now,

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.460
some things just go together. Let's just make it every day real life,

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.979
illustrates for some people an ice cream sundae. It's not complete unless it includes chocolate

00:03:54.979 --> 00:04:05.699
sauce, whipped cream, sprinkles, and what else? The cherry on top, right? The combination is what defines

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:14.180
it. Well, far more importantly, on a spiritual level, our love of righteousness and our acts of

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:22.660
justice must include mercy whenever possible. Jehovah requires that we uphold all of his righteous

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:31.459
standards. So to answer a question from earlier, James 117 tells us that Jehovah does not vary or

00:04:31.459 --> 00:04:41.699
change. And quoting Jehovah himself, Malachi 3 and verse 6 says, I am Jehovah, I do not change.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:49.620
So then, Jehovah doesn't change, and his standards as to what is right and wrong have not changed.

00:04:50.579 --> 00:04:56.019
That is why recent adjustments to our view of God's mercy are just that.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:03.220
Adjustments to our view or understanding. Have you been able to adjust?

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.660
Jesus too loves righteousness, justice, and mercy, and like his father, he does not change.

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:20.100
Hebrews 138 says of Jesus that he is the same yesterday and today and forever.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:28.420
This means that what Jesus did while he was on earth teaches us about his thinking now, right now.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:36.819
For example, Jesus displayed intense love for righteousness and justice by driving out the money

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:43.459
changers from the temple area on two occasions. The money changers were extorting the people

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:50.259
and they were turning Jehovah's house into a house of commerce and Jesus hated that.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:06:00.019
He hated it. Jesus' zeal for what is right moved him to act. And in doing so, he also demonstrated

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:08.579
his merciful concern for the people. Above all, we see in such actions the love that Jesus has for

00:06:08.579 --> 00:06:16.339
the pure worship of his father. And because Jesus doesn't change, he still has the same desire

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:22.899
to drive out what is bad. As the wickedness of this world increases,

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:31.699
we know that Jehovah and his son will always do what is right, what is just, and what is merciful.

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:39.540
At Exodus 34, verses 6 and 7, we find a summary of Jehovah's balanced qualities.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:49.620
Now it reads in part, Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and compassionate, slow to anger,

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:55.300
and abundant in loyal love and truth, showing loyal love to thousands,

00:06:56.019 --> 00:07:04.420
pardoning error and transgression and sin, but he will by no means leave the guilty unpunished.

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:12.500
Well, knowing that Jehovah will by no means leave the guilty unpunished, what thing should we

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:21.300
then help to tear down or send away from the congregations? At the same time, knowing that

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:28.420
Jehovah is merciful and compassionate as stated there, what thing should we then help to build up

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:36.339
and welcome back into the congregation? We'll look at an interesting account in Zechariah chapter 5

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:43.139
as well as some other accounts and find some answers. As we do look for the lessons that we can

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:50.660
apply to our efforts to show righteousness, justice, and mercy. So then first of all,

00:07:51.540 --> 00:08:00.579
what should we tear down and send out? The concept of tearing down is not difficult to see when we

00:08:00.579 --> 00:08:08.579
think of it in terms of a building. Some houses are just beyond repair and for this reason they

00:08:08.579 --> 00:08:15.699
must be torn down. The house and disillustration makes that point, doesn't it? I don't think you're

00:08:15.699 --> 00:08:24.019
going to fix that one. Have that in mind as we consider what Zechariah saw. Now Zechariah was a

00:08:24.019 --> 00:08:30.819
prophet who was favored with seeing some amazing God-given visions. And what he said describes

00:08:31.459 --> 00:08:38.899
real conditions that existed in Israel at the time. At Zechariah 5 and verse 2, we read that an

00:08:38.899 --> 00:08:49.139
angel asks Zechariah, what do you see? Zechariah replies that he sees a very large flying scroll depicted

00:08:49.139 --> 00:08:57.460
here. The flying scroll was written on both sides and contains a curse that tears down the houses

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:06.419
of wickedness, leaving evil exposed. One side of the scroll targets those who steal. The other

00:09:06.419 --> 00:09:14.659
side targets those who lie or who make false oaths. After the house is consumed or torn down,

00:09:14.659 --> 00:09:21.139
he next sees an IFA container. It contains a figurative woman referred to as wickedness

00:09:21.139 --> 00:09:29.620
who is trying to escape. She is exposed. And the angel treats her appropriately by throwing her back

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:37.299
into the container and thrusting a heavy lead weight over it. The container with wickedness is

00:09:37.299 --> 00:09:46.740
then removed from the land. Expose, restrain, remove. The angel's actions leave no doubt about

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:54.580
how Jehovah views such things. What lessons can we take away from the vision? Well, first,

00:09:55.299 --> 00:10:03.139
we see that Jehovah does not tolerate wickedness such as lying and stealing. We find scriptural

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:10.740
examples of this and how Jehovah dealt with greedy aiken or what happened with Ananias and

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:17.940
Sapphira. We know there's accounts, don't we? God's word lists many things that Jehovah does not

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:28.659
tolerate. For instance, Proverbs 6 verses 16 through 19 speaks of Jehovah's hatred for a lying

00:10:28.659 --> 00:10:38.019
tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart plotting wicked schemes, or a false witness who

00:10:38.019 --> 00:10:46.419
lies with every breath and so forth. And Revelation 21-8 speaks of everlasting destruction

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:55.940
for those who unrepentantly practice what isn't moral. Well, next, we learn from Zechariah's

00:10:55.940 --> 00:11:04.820
vision that Jehovah uses his faithful angels to expose wickedness. The lesson? Treat wickedness

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:12.820
like Jehovah and his faithful angels do by tearing it down, exposing it, and removing it from the

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:21.139
congregation. Expose and remove. We do not want the conduct of unrepentant ones to take up residence

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:29.539
in our congregations. That is why, since sin is still on the earth, the elders will continue to

00:11:29.539 --> 00:11:37.460
remove unrepentant ones from the congregation. Nevertheless, while there are things that we must

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:45.299
send out from the congregation, what must we help to build it up and welcome back into the congregation?

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:55.779
When wrongdoing is removed from among Jehovah's people and they are united together and clean and

00:11:55.779 --> 00:12:06.340
pure worship, Jehovah sees this and his people are blessed. Malachi 3 and verse 16 tells us that he

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:14.179
is paying attention and he is listening. For those who properly fear him, he places their names in

00:12:14.179 --> 00:12:23.299
his book of remembrance. What a privilege. Even so, to keep his blessing, we must also imitate

00:12:23.299 --> 00:12:32.419
his mercy and remain ready to welcome back repentant ones. Like the concept of tearing down,

00:12:33.059 --> 00:12:38.899
the concept of building up is not difficult to picture when you think of it in terms of a building.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:45.620
Now, some houses are in bad shape, but they are not beyond repair, like the one we saw earlier,

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:53.460
they can be restored as illustrated on screen. It's in bad shape, but look at that. It can be fixed up.

00:12:54.899 --> 00:13:00.980
With that in mind, when it comes to welcoming back and building up repentant ones, we are

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:08.580
helped to do this when we imitate Jesus and the faithful angels. They have not only witnessed

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:15.139
Jehovah's mercy from the start, but they have developed this quality themselves. Here is what we

00:13:15.139 --> 00:13:24.580
mean. When humans were first created, mercy was not needed because humans were perfect. Only after

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:31.539
the rebellion, when the first imperfect child was born, did this aspect of Jehovah's love and

00:13:31.539 --> 00:13:38.980
compassion become evident. Jesus and the angels witnessed Jehovah's great love and action,

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:47.779
when he extended mercy to humans who were born in sin. In turn, these faithful angels

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:54.659
imitated their Heavenly Father and showed mercy in helping to build up repentant ones on earth.

00:13:54.659 --> 00:14:03.220
For example, Jesus showed mercy to Peter, didn't he, and also to the woman who poured perfumed oil on

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:11.779
his feet. Jesus used powerful illustrations to help us understand the depth of God's mercy,

00:14:11.779 --> 00:14:17.299
just reading the parable of the lost son who returned and Luke chapter 15 makes the point,

00:14:17.299 --> 00:14:24.659
doesn't it? So like Jesus and the faithful angels, we desire to imitate Jehovah's precious

00:14:24.659 --> 00:14:31.700
qualities. All of them. That is why we seek to welcome back and build up repentant ones.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:38.659
We do this in harmony with the direction that the congregations have received. Now, regarding this

00:14:38.659 --> 00:14:44.419
direction, one person who was removed from the congregation wrote to the governing body,

00:14:45.139 --> 00:14:54.100
and this is what he said. The fact that friends can now say a simple heartfelt greeting blows my mind.

00:14:55.059 --> 00:15:01.620
I have felt like a walking plague walking into the kingdom hall as many friends avoided eye contact

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:09.220
and would clear out of the way. But I get it. That was our understanding up until that time.

00:15:10.179 --> 00:15:18.340
Jehovah is an amazing one and only true God. His love is always being manifested as in this case,

00:15:19.059 --> 00:15:25.620
to direct you brothers to announce this new arrangement. I look forward to receiving a visit from

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:34.500
the elders. Well, what a fine expression that was. Things do change over time,

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:41.779
but like that repentant when he gets it and see, we get it. Jehovah is helping us to understand

00:15:41.779 --> 00:15:48.580
why these changes come and we comply and we love it. As we have considered, Jehovah's qualities of

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:54.740
love and mercy, though, have not changed, but our understanding of his marvelous qualities,

00:15:55.379 --> 00:16:02.500
well, this has improved. Each of us must work to learn the depth of his love and mercy and then show

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:09.940
the depth of these things ourselves. At the same time, Jehovah's standards of righteousness and

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:17.139
justice have not changed. Each of us must work to uphold his standards of right and wrong,

00:16:17.139 --> 00:16:23.620
like the angel and Zechariah's prophecy, elders today must protect Jehovah's people by exposing,

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:30.100
restraining and sending out what is bad from the congregation. So in summary,

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:37.940
while we do not hesitate to tear down wickedness and send it away, we desire to do all that we can

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:46.179
to bring back and build up those who return to Jehovah.
