00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:10.369
Welcome to the Always Rejoice Convention of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:18.609
We're so happy that you were able to arrange to attend all three days of this convention.

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:28.370
Why were the Apostle Paul's words at Philippians 4-4 chosen as the theme for this year's convention?

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:48.369
Well over the past four years, the governing body has used conventions to highlight qualities that endear us to Jehovah and help us to be victorious in our struggle against Satan and his world.

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:57.369
We've had convention themes that focused on the need for loyalty, endurance,

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:03.369
courage, and love.

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:09.370
This year, the convention theme highlights the need for joy.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:18.370
At Nehemiah 810, we're told the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:25.370
In the near future, our faith will be tested as never before.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:38.370
But if we acquire true joy with the help of God's Holy Spirit, we will be able to stand firm and weather all the storms that come our way.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.370
Godly joy is a deep-seated quality of the heart.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:52.370
It's a state of happiness that remains whether the conditions around us are pleasant or not.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:02:01.370
In fact, a person can be disturbed about something, but still have joy in his heart.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:19.370
For example, the apostles were flogged for speaking about the Christ, yet they went out from before the Sanadran rejoicing because they had been counted worthy to be dishonored in behalf of his name.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:34.370
Obviously, they weren't rejoicing over the flogging they had received, but as servants of God, they found true joy in keeping their integrity to Him.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:41.370
However, is it possible for a Christian always to be rejoicing?

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:50.370
Yes, because true joy is an aspect of the fruitage of God's Holy Spirit.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:03:03.370
As an inward quality, joy is not dependent on external things, not even on our brothers, but it does depend on God's Spirit.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:20.370
And as already noted, our joy comes from that deep inner satisfaction of knowing that we have the truth, that we're doing what pleases Jehovah, and that our Kingdom Hope is sure.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:30.370
So Godly joy is not the transient joy that people experience because they've secured a well-paying job.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:42.370
Gone on an exotic vacation, attain fame and prestige, or acquire some coveted material item or large sum of money.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:50.370
No. True joy has to be cultivated by means of Holy Spirit.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:58.370
To obtain Jehovah's Holy Spirit, we have to draw close to Him and give Him exclusive devotion.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:08.370
At Acts 532, we're told that God gives Holy Spirit to those obeying Him as ruler.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:19.370
During these three days, the convention program will help us to deepen our appreciation for Godly joy.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:34.370
We'll learn what true joy is, how to cultivate it, how to maintain it during difficult times, and how to display it as it wells up in our hearts.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:47.370
Such joy will clearly identify us as disciples of Jesus, and it will enable us to serve as beacons of light in this dark world,

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.370
and draw others to our happy God.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:05:00.370
You'll note that nearly the entire second day has been devoted to the joy of disciple making.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:06.370
Godly joy will help us to face challenges to our integrity.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:16.370
Remember that it was the joy that was set before Him that helped Jesus to face an excruciating death on a torture stake.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.370
So please pay rapt attention to the talks and videos.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.370
Look up the scriptures and read them along with the speakers.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:34.370
Thus allowing God's Word to exert its powerful force on your heart.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:45.370
May this convention become a milestone in your development as a joyful imitator of our happy God.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:56.370
How thankful we are that He made us in His image, giving us the capacity to feel and express Godly joy.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:05.370
And how thankful we are that He also gives us His Holy Spirit to help us cultivate that kind of joy.

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:19.370
We love you very much, and we pray that each one of you will forever respond to the words of the Psalmist at Psalm 100 verse 2.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.370
Serve Jehovah with rejoicing.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.370
Come into His presence with joyful shouting.
