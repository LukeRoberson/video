00:00:03.339 --> 00:00:21.399
First, we asked the branch for permission.

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:24.399
Once they gave us approval, we began to make preparations

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:27.399
for the assembly, though we had absolutely nothing.

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:31.399
So one brother lent us a property for the assembly set.

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.399
Our brothers have brought many different skills

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:35.399
to the project.

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.399
There are metal workers, cabinet makers, and brick layers.

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.399
Many brothers have given up their resources

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.399
and used their abilities so that this project could go ahead.

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.399
This is really made us stand out here.

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.399
People were asking each other, what is happening here?

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.399
And who paid for all of this?

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.399
They say people are surprised at how many workers are coming to help.

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.400
And I wonder, if this is getting attention now,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.400
what will the assembly be like?

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.900
A comfortable, practical, and secure assembly hall was constructed.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.900
Using materials acquired locally,

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.900
expectation grew as the special day drew closer.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.900
And when it finally arrived, those in attendance

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.870
experienced something truly moving.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.870
With Jehovah's help, many interested ones,

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.870
along with our brothers and sisters,

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.870
have come here today to celebrate our first assembly

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.870
in Brebury language.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:47.390
Friends, this is wonderful.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.739
When the program started in Brebury, I cried.

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:57.739
I'm so happy to have participated in the assembly,

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:03.170
especially because it's in my own language.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.170
It's what we wanted.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.169
We hope it continues just like this.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:13.169
We walked a long way to invite these people.

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:17.169
And to see them here, it makes me very happy.

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:28.280
The information presented in the local language touched many hearts.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.280
This was truly an historic event for our Indigenous brothers and Costa Rica.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.280
Jehovah has made it possible for more people in this isolated region

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.280
to enjoy his spiritual blessing.
