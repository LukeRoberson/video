WEBVTT

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:10.359
We would like to welcome all of you to this update on the situation facing our brothers

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:12.359
in Russia.

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:22.079
As you know, on April 20th, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation ruled against

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:29.559
Jehovah's Witnesses and decided to liquidate the administrative center of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:35.920
in Russia and all of our local religious organizations.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:45.880
We appealed this decision and the hearing for the appeal took place in Moscow on July 17th.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:57.039
Sadly, the three-judge panel upheld this unjust decision against us, which effectively

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:02.320
bans our religious activity in Russia.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:10.760
In a few moments, we will be speaking with Brother Mark Sanderson of the governing body

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.719
who was with our brothers during the appeal hearing in Moscow.

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:23.319
But before we talk to Brother Sanderson, let's first visit with a delegation that accompanied

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:28.719
him in attending the Supreme Court hearing.

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:37.879
The delegations resolved to help our brothers in Russia reassures us of the unity of our

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:49.189
organization and the need for all of us to face challenges with courage.

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.549
We are on route to Heathrow Airport to flying to Frankfurt to meet up with some brothers

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.829
who are heading off to Moscow together to go to the Supreme Court hearing on July 17th.

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:05.469
Our delegation is made up of 20 brothers from 18 different lands.

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:07.909
I truly love the brothers in Russia.

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.270
I've had association with them for many years.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.469
I was in a Russian congregation and so my heart is right with the brothers and sisters

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:16.469
in Russia.

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:21.830
I worked in the Russian language field for 13 years before I came to Bethel.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.310
So I feel like the Russian brothers and sisters are really my family.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.789
Everywhere I go, the brothers are always asking, how are the friends in Russia?

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:35.669
And they want me to reassure them that they have been praying for them.

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:40.189
And that's not just mature brothers in the congregation, young children ask the question

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:41.189
as well.

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:43.590
They've been taught to pray for the brothers in Russia.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.949
I could have filled up my language with many drawings from the children in Belgium for

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.389
the brothers, their little brothers in Russia.

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:59.590
And we also have heard some cases of inactive brothers and sisters who have been deeply

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.069
moved by the determination of our brothers in Russia.

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:12.110
And the brothers in Sweden were so impressed by the fine attitude, especially when the

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.270
police is raiding the kingdom halls.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:22.430
Sometimes they are threatened, but they are sitting in quiet and calm and they are not insulting

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.789
in return.

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:28.509
Do I fear going to Russia where our work is under ban?

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:30.030
Not at all.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.990
There is no reason to be afraid.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:38.509
I am ready to join my brothers and stand by their side in this historic moment.

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:44.189
I'm not afraid to go to Russia, not because I feel I'm so strong.

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:48.990
But because I feel that Jehovah is going to be with us and he is the one who is going

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.189
to be supporting us.

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:57.949
Our intent is to try to meet with as many of the high officials from the various embassies

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:00.229
in Moscow as possible.

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:07.669
And we have done those meetings in the spirit of first Peter 3, 15, where it says that

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:15.629
we should defend our fate and our hope, but do it with the mild timber and the prospect.

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:17.149
And that's what we have done.

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:21.870
We don't demand anything from the officials, but we tell them what's the situation with

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:22.870
our brothers.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:48.180
17th of January 2017, the National Federation of the Russian Federation of the Berlin

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.259
The decision was made by the Russian Federation of the 20th to the end of 2017,

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:55.060
remains without change.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.180
The official wish was to organize the current center of the Republic of Russia without

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.180
any change.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.139
During the hearing of the people who were here in this hall,

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.300
Jehovah could clearly see that the people of the Republic were not extremists.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.180
The purpose of the Russian Federation is to start a religious movement,

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:27.060
which is a very sad situation for our country, and in general for freedom.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:34.420
The court case against our brothers in Russia in some aspects resembles the court case against

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.819
Jesus Christ.

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:46.579
It looked 2267 when asked if he was the Christ, Jesus said to the Sanhedron,

00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:52.939
"'Even if I told you, you would not believe it at all.

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:59.740
Similarly, our brothers have been able to show striking evidence to prove that the charges

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.579
against us are completely unfounded.

00:06:04.579 --> 00:06:13.660
But despite such evidence, which is clear even to non-witnesses, it is as if we have said

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.980
nothing.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:24.699
Such treatment of God's people, though, is to be expected in these last days.

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:30.060
But now, we have Brother Mark Sanderson of the governing body tied in with us.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:35.939
And first, we'd like to say, Mark, thank you very much for joining us for this interview.

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:42.620
And especially, thank you very much for being with the brothers there in Russia.

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:45.990
Well, thank you so much, Steve.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:53.069
It really was a joy and really an honor to be with our brothers in the courtroom in Russia.

00:06:53.069 --> 00:07:00.550
But now, let me ask you this, what impact will this decision have on our brothers and

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:05.370
sisters in Russia?

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:10.529
Well, perhaps it's too early to know exactly what will take place.

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:16.689
But certainly, when we met with various officials at the embassies in Moscow, their feeling

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:24.889
is that this is going to give open license for individuals who are prejudiced to really

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:28.970
just take out their feelings on all of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.850
Already, we've seen incidences of witnesses having their homes burned.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.569
We've had kingdom halls be vandalized.

00:07:36.649 --> 00:07:40.930
We've had children harassed at school by their teachers.

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:44.290
We've had brothers threatened with loss of employment.

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:52.939
So we can expect that we will see greater persecution in that land.

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:57.500
Well, we're sorry to hear that, but we know that's reality.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:04.759
But let me ask you, are there options for appeal available at this point?

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:10.199
Well, within the country of Russia, we've exhausted all of the available appeals.

00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:15.600
But of course, we are going to take this matter to the European Court of Human Rights.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:22.319
In fact, within the next day or two, we will be applying for what is called interim measures

00:08:22.319 --> 00:08:31.959
where the European Court, if they choose, can step in and even attempt to block the carrying

00:08:31.959 --> 00:08:34.279
out of a major decision.

00:08:34.279 --> 00:08:40.320
Of course, really, it's very uncertain as to whether Russia will actually respect the

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.440
actions of the European Court.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:46.230
We'll have to wait and see.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:54.919
Mark, do you see any scriptural parallels to the events you witnessed in the Supreme Court?

00:08:54.919 --> 00:09:00.259
You know, Steve, I couldn't help but continually think of what Jesus had said in the Matthew

00:09:00.259 --> 00:09:09.080
chapter 5 and verse 11 when he said that they would lyingly say every sort of wicked thing

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.539
against you.

00:09:10.539 --> 00:09:16.220
And that is just exactly what we heard again this time during the appeal hearing.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:22.259
These officials were just repeating these ridiculous accusations against Jehovah's Witnesses

00:09:22.259 --> 00:09:27.779
attempting to even equate us with terrorist groups.

00:09:27.779 --> 00:09:33.419
Now already, the authorities of the world are speaking out about this.

00:09:33.419 --> 00:09:39.179
The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom on Monday already issued

00:09:39.179 --> 00:09:40.539
a statement.

00:09:40.539 --> 00:09:45.460
And maybe I can just read you the first paragraph of this statement that was released.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:52.059
They said the US Commission on International Religious Freedom denounces the Russian Supreme

00:09:52.059 --> 00:09:57.620
Court ruling on Monday rejecting an appeal by the Jehovah's Witnesses against an

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.259
April decision declaring them as extremist.

00:10:01.259 --> 00:10:10.419
USCIRF Chairman Daniel Mark commented that quote, the Supreme Court's decision sadly reflects

00:10:10.419 --> 00:10:18.100
the government's continued equating of peaceful religious freedom practice to extremism.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:24.779
The witnesses are not an extremist group and should be able to practice their faith openly

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:29.980
and freely and without government repression, end of quote.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:35.100
So these government officials of the world, they recognize the truth.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:40.379
They understand that these charges that have been laid against us are truly ridiculous

00:10:40.379 --> 00:10:42.460
and absurd.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.940
What a powerful statement you read there.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:53.100
Now we learned in the segment, we just watched that the brothers in the delegation had

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:57.659
an opportunity to speak to embassy representatives in Moscow.

00:10:57.659 --> 00:11:04.899
Let me ask you, Mark, what were the results of those meetings?

00:11:04.899 --> 00:11:10.580
Well, just to begin, Steve, I'd like to just comment about the courage of these men who

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.139
accepted this assignment to go to Moscow.

00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:19.659
You know, when they were invited to come on this assignment, not one of these men, even

00:11:19.659 --> 00:11:24.779
for a moment, even asked a question like, is this safe?

00:11:24.779 --> 00:11:29.059
Will my, will I be in danger in going on this assignment?

00:11:29.059 --> 00:11:33.100
Immediately they said yes and began making their plans.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:40.220
And then once in Moscow, we divided into five different groups so that we could visit

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:45.100
the embassies of the countries that we belong to.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:50.779
And so myself, I was assigned to go with a group that met with four different embassies.

00:11:50.779 --> 00:11:58.139
We visited the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and Canada.

00:11:58.139 --> 00:12:03.379
And at each of these four embassies, we were given a beautiful reception.

00:12:03.379 --> 00:12:08.019
In one case, we met with an ambassador, in two cases, we met with deputy ambassadors

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:12.419
and in the final one, we met with one of the secretaries.

00:12:12.419 --> 00:12:17.980
But I have to say, as these people listened to what we had to say, of course, they're already

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.299
very informed about our issue.

00:12:20.299 --> 00:12:26.179
But the question that kept coming over and over again was, why Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:12:26.179 --> 00:12:31.059
Why isn't Jehovah's Witnesses are receiving this kind of attention from the government?

00:12:31.059 --> 00:12:38.179
Well, we were able to give a very, very fine witness and include many scriptural thoughts.

00:12:38.179 --> 00:12:44.340
And particularly to one ambassador who's a real gentleman and really listened to us patiently,

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:50.179
we were able to say that we, Jehovah's Witnesses have come through the concentration camps

00:12:50.179 --> 00:12:52.019
in the Nazi times.

00:12:52.019 --> 00:12:55.059
We've survived being exiled to Siberia.

00:12:55.059 --> 00:12:57.860
We survived the work camps in the Gulag.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:02.460
And all of this because of the protection of our God Jehovah.

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:04.379
That's why we're still here.

00:13:04.379 --> 00:13:09.059
And we continue to look to our God, Jehovah, for His protection.

00:13:09.059 --> 00:13:15.820
And so the reason that we had come to see these officials was because we are reasonable people.

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:21.340
And we wanted to talk to other reasonable people to see what might be done to help our brothers

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.940
and sisters.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:29.460
And these officials were so extremely receptive to this type of approach and what an honor

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:34.059
it was to be able to praise the name of Jehovah before them.

00:13:34.059 --> 00:13:37.179
Very encouraging mark.

00:13:37.179 --> 00:13:45.110
How did the brothers though react when they heard the negative decision?

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:51.990
Well, Steve, there's always been a joyful presence in the courtroom on these different

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.789
occasions when I've been president in Russia.

00:13:54.789 --> 00:14:01.309
But this time with the reading of this decision, there is certainly a soberness among our brothers.

00:14:01.309 --> 00:14:05.269
And they recognize the seriousness of this matter.

00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:11.269
But I have to say, I think the Apostle Paul really sums up the way our brothers feel in

00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:12.590
Russia.

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:20.669
In 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and verse 8, where he said, we are hard pressed in every way,

00:14:20.669 --> 00:14:23.350
but not cramped beyond movement.

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:27.990
We are perplexed, but not absolutely with no way out.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:31.710
We are persecuted, but not abandoned.

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:35.909
We are knocked down, but not destroyed.

00:14:35.909 --> 00:14:43.629
And I think just even in a small way, where it says that we are persecuted, but not abandoned,

00:14:43.629 --> 00:14:50.509
I think that just having this international delegation in the courtroom to see that brothers

00:14:50.509 --> 00:14:55.070
were willing to come, risking their own safety to support the brothers, to be there with

00:14:55.070 --> 00:15:01.070
them in the courtroom at this difficult time, just was a reassurance that Jehovah himself

00:15:01.149 --> 00:15:02.750
was with them.

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:09.070
And that these representatives, in some small way, represented to them, Jehovah's love,

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:15.470
Jehovah's care, and that certainly we were not going to abandon our dear brothers in

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:19.750
Russia no matter what situation may come.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:27.429
I like that thought too, Mark, that we're not down, but we're not destroyed.

00:15:27.429 --> 00:15:31.590
We could say we're not down, but not knocked out.

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:34.830
With Jehovah's help, we get back up again.

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:40.590
But now, how have our brothers and sisters in Russia been faring since the first Supreme

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:41.950
Court ruling in April?

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:49.669
Well, you know, Steve, as I mentioned earlier, there have been many incidents across the

00:15:49.669 --> 00:15:52.750
country of vandalism, of attacks.

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:59.750
Of course, we've been reporting on JW.org about our dear brother, Dennis Christensen, who

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:08.429
was arrested and has been held now for two months basically in the prison there in Russia.

00:16:08.429 --> 00:16:13.190
He has not been allowed to communicate with his wife during this time.

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:18.110
And now we learned when we were present in Russia that the officials only allow him to

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:19.590
shower twice a week.

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:25.029
Can you imagine treating him as though he was a very, very serious criminal when all he

00:16:25.029 --> 00:16:31.509
did was attend a meeting to read God's word and worship Jehovah.

00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:32.830
What a horrible thing.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:38.389
And of course, the officials from all the countries of the world recognized the terrible, terrible

00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:40.830
injustice that's being done here.

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:47.230
But having said that, in spite of these attacks that we have seen across the country, what

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:53.230
we also see is that our brothers and sisters are continuing in their worship for Jehovah.

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:57.710
They're continuing to have their meetings.

00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:01.789
One of the brothers commented to me, he said, some who used to never comment at the meetings,

00:17:01.789 --> 00:17:05.789
now they love to comment and comment and express themselves.

00:17:05.789 --> 00:17:10.190
Some who have been inactive have begun to attend the meetings again.

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:15.789
And one brother told me that when they held a small mini convention, you know, watching

00:17:15.789 --> 00:17:22.549
some of the replays that have been made available, that just in their small group, they had five

00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:23.549
baptized.

00:17:23.549 --> 00:17:24.549
Can you imagine?

00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:31.789
So we can say with confidence that all of these efforts that are being made to try to

00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:38.069
stop our worship of Jehovah, to wipe it out, are not going to have any success.

00:17:38.069 --> 00:17:42.390
It really reminds me, would it be okay if I just shared this scriptural thought?

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:45.069
Absolutely, please.

00:17:45.069 --> 00:17:50.750
It just makes me think of this thought in Psalm 124.

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:54.150
And this really has to be the confidence of our brothers in Russia, but it needs to be

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:56.869
the confidence really of God's people all around the world.

00:17:56.869 --> 00:18:00.470
We have to put our faith in these words.

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:07.349
It says, if Jehovah had not been with us, this verse two, if Jehovah had not been with us,

00:18:07.349 --> 00:18:13.430
when men rose up to attack us, then they would have swallowed us up alive.

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:16.630
And their anger was burning against us.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:19.630
Then the waters would have washed us away.

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:22.029
The torrent would have swept over us.

00:18:22.029 --> 00:18:25.430
The raging waters would have overwhelmed us.

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:31.509
May Jehovah be praised, for he has not given us as prey to their teeth.

00:18:31.509 --> 00:18:34.950
We are like a bird that escaped from the hunter's trap.

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:38.670
The trap was broken and we escaped.

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:44.630
Our help is in the name of Jehovah, the maker of heaven and earth.

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:50.950
Well, so many times our enemies have thought that they had us locked in that trap and that

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:56.549
there was no way to escape, but how Jehovah has proven them wrong and how he has come

00:18:56.549 --> 00:18:58.829
to the aid of his people.

00:18:58.829 --> 00:19:01.990
And that is the same confidence that we have today.

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:04.109
And it's the same confidence our brothers will have.

00:19:04.109 --> 00:19:08.230
It's the same confidence we'll have no matter where we are in the world as the scene

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:11.390
of this world continues to change.

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:19.589
We wholeheartedly agree with you and it definitely warms our heart to hear the strengthening

00:19:19.589 --> 00:19:20.829
comments.

00:19:20.829 --> 00:19:24.630
Thank you very much, Mark, and thank you again too.

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:31.509
And the rest of the delegation for traveling to Russia to be with our dear brothers and

00:19:31.509 --> 00:19:33.150
sisters.

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:39.630
And we're confident that your presence assured them of Jehovah's love and Jehovah's

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:41.470
care for them.

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:42.869
Thank you so much, Steve.

00:19:42.869 --> 00:19:45.910
As I said, it was a great, great honor and privilege.

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:51.160
I truly love our dear brothers in Russia.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:20:00.319
Although the appeal decision was not in our favor, we are not disheartened.

00:20:00.319 --> 00:20:09.240
This is our regional convention theme for this year emphasizes, we do not give up.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:18.680
Brothers and sisters in Russia, we encourage you to stay close to Jehovah and his organization.

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:25.440
Continue to pray to Jehovah for strength to face this persecution with boldness.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:33.440
Knowing he will provide you with a strength needed, along with a guidance and wisdom that

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.079
you need.

00:20:35.079 --> 00:20:44.240
And please know that you are excellent examples for the rest of us to follow when we face

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.359
persecution.

00:20:46.359 --> 00:20:55.519
We wholeheartedly agree with the Bible writer's expressions in a back at 3 verse 18.

00:20:55.519 --> 00:20:56.519
He said,

00:20:56.519 --> 00:21:04.480
Yet as for me, I will exalt in Jehovah.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:09.759
I will be joyful in the God of my salvation.

00:21:09.759 --> 00:21:16.200
Yes, whatever the world does to us, we maintain our faith in Jehovah's

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:26.839
saving power and will do our utmost to remain in Jehovah's protective care.

00:21:26.839 --> 00:21:35.480
