00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.480
Our family and friends are precious to us.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.689
They show us love.

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:15.730
They are there when we need them.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.879
So when we lose a loved one in death,

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:25.980
we want comfort from someone who understands.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.609
God and His Son, Jesus, understand.

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:33.210
While on Earth,

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.609
Jesus experienced the pain of losing family and friends.

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:41.609
After the death of a close friend named Lazarus,

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.210
Jesus' grief was intense.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.710
He felt what others felt.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.960
The pain was crushing,

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.859
yet His empathy moved Him to comfort others.

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:00.859
Still, He wanted to do more.

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:02.859
Jesus spoke with His Father

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:07.359
and brought His friend back to life.

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:11.760
Jehovah God and Jesus have not changed.

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:15.359
They feel pain when people die.

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:17.359
They feel your pain

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:21.359
and have promised to eliminate death.

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:24.159
God will swallow up death forever.

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.340
Jehovah will wipe away the tears from all faces.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.040
Jesus also gave this beautiful promise for the future.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.239
Do not be amazed at this.

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:37.640
For the hour is coming

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.239
in which all those in the memorial tombs

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:44.140
will hear His voice and come out.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.439

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.239
