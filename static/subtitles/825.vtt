WEBVTT

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:09.410
Are you there? Is your name there? Is your name written in the book of life?

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:19.010
What book of life? Well, in Malachi, chapter 3, we notice that it refers to a book of remembrance

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:26.929
and this book has a record of all those who feared Jehovah and treasure his name.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:35.649
Yes, this book of remembrance is a record of all those who are in line to receive everlasting life.

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.890
So all of us want to have our names written in that book, don't we?

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:49.329
But if we do have our book named in that book, does that mean automatically that we will receive

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:56.850
everlasting life? No. We remember what Jehovah said to Moses as recorded in Exodus 30,

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:03.409
there he said, anyone who sins against me, I will wipe out from my book.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:13.090
So names can be erased from this book of life. It's as if our names are written in this book of

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:21.890
life in pencil. So all of us surely want to make sure that our names remain in this book of life,

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.810
right through to the time that they are written permanently in the book in pen as it were.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:37.090
But whose names are in this book of life? We're going to consider together five different

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.329
groups of persons, some of whom have their names in the book of life and others don't.

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:58.879
So let's watch this presentation that discusses these five groups. The first group,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.920
those who have been selected to rule with Jesus in heaven, are their names written in this book

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:15.360
of life? According to Philippians 4-3, the answer is yes. But even though they have been anointed

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.360
with Holy Spirit, they still need to remain faithful in order to have their names written

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:28.479
permanently in this book. The second group, the great crowd of Armageddon survivors,

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.719
are the names of these faithful ones now written in the book of life? Yes.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.639
What about after they survive Armageddon? Will their names still be in the book of life? Yes.

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:53.599
How do we know? At Matthew 25-46, Jesus says that these sheep like ones depart into everlasting life.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.080
But does that mean they are granted everlasting life at the beginning of the thousand year reign?

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:09.680
No. Revelation 7-17 tells us that Jesus will guide them to springs of waters of life.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:17.039
So they don't immediately receive everlasting life. However, their names are written in the book of

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:24.960
life in pencil as it were. The third group, the goats who will be destroyed at Armageddon,

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:32.719
their names are not in the book of life. Second, Thessalonians 1-9 tells us,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:40.000
these very ones will undergo the judicial punishment of everlasting destruction.

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:46.240
The same could be said of those who have deliberately sinned against the Holy Spirit.

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:52.800
They too receive everlasting destruction, not everlasting life.

00:03:53.599 --> 00:04:02.639
So the first three groups are, the anointed, the great crowd, and the goats. Of these three,

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:11.199
only two are found in the book of life. Now let's talk about two more groups, those who will

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:18.480
be resurrected in the new world. First though, let's read together Acts 24-15.

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:26.800
There the Apostle Paul says, I have hoped toward God, which hope these men also look forward to,

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:33.759
that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:41.759
So the fourth group are the righteous who have died. These include some of our loved ones.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.160
Are their names written in the book of life? Yes.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:54.240
Revelation 17-8 tells us that this book has been in existence since the founding of the world.

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:02.000
Jesus referred to Abel as living from the founding of the world. So we can assume that his name

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.040
was the first name written in that book. Since that time, millions of other righteous ones

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.560
have had their names added to this book. Now here's an important question.

00:05:15.519 --> 00:05:21.040
When these righteous ones died, were their names taken out of the book of life?

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:29.920
No. They're still living in Jehovah's memory. Remember Jesus said that Jehovah is a God not

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:37.040
of the dead, but of the living, for they are all living to him. The righteous will be restored

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:44.160
to life here on earth with their names still written in the book of life. They did good things

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:51.279
before they died. So that is why they will be part of the resurrection of the righteous ones.

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:58.240
No doubt some of them will receive privileges, such as serving as princes in all the earth.

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:06.560
Finally, let's talk about the resurrection of the unrighteous. For the most part,

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.279
the unrighteous didn't have an opportunity to develop a relationship with Jehovah.

00:06:12.079 --> 00:06:17.680
They did not live righteous lives, so that's why they are called unrighteous.

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:24.399
When these unrighteous ones are resurrected, are their names written in the book of life?

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:31.439
No, but they're being resurrected gives them an opportunity to have their names

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:39.120
eventually written in the book of life. These unrighteous ones will need a lot of help.

00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:46.959
In their former life, some of them practiced horrible, vile things. So they'll need to learn

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:55.279
to live by Jehovah's standards. To accomplish this, God's kingdom will sponsor the greatest

00:06:55.279 --> 00:07:03.490
education program in all human history. Who will teach these unrighteous persons?

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.730
Those who have their names written in pencil in the book of life, the great crowd and the

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:17.329
resurrected righteous ones. How can these unrighteous ones have their names written in the book of

00:07:17.329 --> 00:07:24.209
life? They will need to develop a relationship with Jehovah and dedicate their lives to him.

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:34.290
But will all the unrighteous accept that opportunity? No. Remember, all these unrighteous ones

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:42.290
will be under the careful watch of Jesus and His fellow judges. Isaiah 65-20 tells us

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:49.569
that those who refuse to accept this help will be removed. No one will be allowed to cause any

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:56.930
ruin in the new world. So any who display a wicked attitude during the thousand years will be

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:06.850
removed. With all these facts in mind then, let's now read together John 5, 28 and 29.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:15.329
Jesus said, do not be amazed at this for the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial

00:08:15.329 --> 00:08:23.009
tombs will hear His voice and come out. Those who did good things to a resurrection of life

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:33.039
and those who practice vile things to a resurrection of judgment. Now, for a few moments,

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:42.879
let's think about those verses in John 5, 28 and 29. Up to now, we have understood Jesus' words

00:08:42.879 --> 00:08:51.759
to mean that the resurrected ones will do good things and some will do vile things after their

00:08:51.759 --> 00:09:00.960
resurrection. But not as there in verse 29, Jesus didn't say they will do these good things or

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:08.080
they will practice vile things. He used the past tense, didn't he? Because he said they did

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:17.039
good things and they practiced vile things. So this would indicate to us that these deeds or actions

00:09:17.039 --> 00:09:24.480
were committed by these ones prior to their death and before they would be resurrected.

00:09:25.679 --> 00:09:31.440
So that makes sense, doesn't because no one is going to be allowed to practice vile things in

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:40.639
a new world. So what did Jesus mean when He mentioned these two factors? Well, for a start,

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:48.399
we could say the righteous ones still, when they're resurrected, have their names written

00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:55.519
in the book of life. It's true, Romans chapter 6 verse 7 says that when someone dies,

00:09:55.519 --> 00:10:03.360
His sins are canceled. But take note of this, not their record of faithfulness. That's not canceled.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:11.759
So the righteous ones are resurrected into the new world and their names are still in the book

00:10:11.759 --> 00:10:18.159
of life. Of course, they need to remain faithful during the thousand years to keep their names

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:24.799
in their book of life. But what about the unrighteous ones? Well, these are the ones who did vile

00:10:24.799 --> 00:10:33.039
things before they died. So when they're resurrected, they don't have their names in the book of life.

00:10:33.039 --> 00:10:41.360
It's not a resurrection to life. It's a resurrection to judgment. Now, why do we say that?

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:49.759
Because there we could say the word judgment is not referring to a condemnation.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:57.279
It's not referring to something that is totally negative. It's true at times the word judgment

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:04.399
can have that meaning. But in the context of these verses, it seems that Jesus is using the word

00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:13.759
judgment in a more neutral sense. So it means more in evaluation or a probation period.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:22.799
So the unrighteous ones will have an opportunity to accept this wonderful education work that's

00:11:22.799 --> 00:11:30.559
going to be done in the new world. And during that time, they will be evaluated. And if they

00:11:30.559 --> 00:11:36.960
dedicate their lives to Jehovah, then their names will be written into the book of life.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:44.000
Now, at this point, you're probably thinking, hmm, is this an adjustment to our understanding?

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:50.799
Yes, it is. So now you think, now, can you just run that past me again?

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:56.029
Well, let's look at this little summary that will help us.

00:11:57.789 --> 00:12:04.669
When Jesus spoke in John 529 of those who would receive a resurrection of life,

00:12:05.629 --> 00:12:13.230
he was referring to those who did good things before they died, those whose names are written

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:22.029
in the book of life. The resurrection of judgment at John 529 involves the resurrection of those

00:12:22.029 --> 00:12:29.870
who practice vile things before they died and whose names are not yet written in the book of life.

00:12:31.549 --> 00:12:38.029
But where the previously righteous or unrighteous, all these resurrected ones will need to obey

00:12:38.029 --> 00:12:44.350
the laws and the new scrolls referred to in Revelation 20 verse 12. There it says,

00:12:45.309 --> 00:12:51.710
I saw the dead, the great and the small standing before the throne, and scrolls were opened.

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:59.629
But another scroll was opened. It is the scroll of life. The dead were judged out of those things

00:12:59.629 --> 00:13:07.789
written in the scrolls, according to their deeds. Yes, they will be judged individually,

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:16.429
according to their deeds. But what deeds? Will it be their deeds committed before they died?

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:22.909
No, otherwise the resurrection of the unrighteous would have been a pointless waste.

00:13:24.029 --> 00:13:28.110
Here then, their deeds cannot be deeds from their former life.

00:13:29.149 --> 00:13:36.029
Rather, this verse must refer to their deeds in response to their training in the new world.

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:43.789
Even such faithful men as Noah, Samuel, David, and Daniel will have to learn about the sacrifice

00:13:43.789 --> 00:13:53.870
of Christ and exercise faith in it. All of this also helps us to understand an amazing prophecy

00:13:53.870 --> 00:14:00.429
in the book of Daniel. Let's turn there. It's Daniel 12 verses 1 through 3.

00:14:01.309 --> 00:14:10.110
There it says, during that time, Michael, who is Jesus Christ, will stand up. That is at

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:18.750
Armageddon. The great prince who is standing since 1914 in behalf of your people.

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:24.269
And there will occur a time of distress. That is the great tribulation,

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:29.870
such as has not occurred since there came to be a nation until that time.

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:37.309
And during that time, your people will escape. Everyone who has found written down

00:14:37.309 --> 00:14:43.950
in the book, and this refers to the great crowd. But notice what follows.

00:14:45.149 --> 00:14:49.070
And many of those asleep in the dust of the earth will wake up,

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:56.669
some to everlasting life, and others to reproach and to everlasting contempt.

00:14:58.879 --> 00:15:05.519
So looking at Daniel 12 and verse 2, it seems appropriate to that we are just

00:15:05.519 --> 00:15:12.720
our understanding of this verse. Notice that it speaks about people waking up in the form of

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:19.039
a resurrection. And this occurs after what's mentioned in verse 1, after the great crowd

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:26.399
survived the great tribulation. So this obviously is talking about a literal resurrection

00:15:26.399 --> 00:15:34.559
of the righteous and unrighteous. But what does it mean when it mentions there in verse 2 that some

00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:43.440
will be raised to everlasting life and others to everlasting contempt? What does that really mean?

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:50.000
Well, when we notice that, we notice there's a little different from what Jesus said in John

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.639
chapter 5. He spoke about life and judgment. But now here it's talking about everlasting life

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:05.679
and everlasting contempt. So that term everlasting helps us to realize that this is talking about the

00:16:05.679 --> 00:16:15.360
final outcome after these ones have had an opportunity to accept the education. So those who are

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:23.200
resurrected who make good use of this education, well, they will continue on and ultimately receive

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:30.320
everlasting life. But then on the other hand, any who refuse to accept the benefits of that

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:37.840
education, they will be judged as worthy of eternal destruction. Now let's finally read

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:46.590
verse 3. And those having insight will shine as brightly as the expansive heaven

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:52.509
and those bringing the many to righteousness like the stars forever and ever.

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:59.789
This is speaking about the massive education work that will be done in the new world.

00:17:00.669 --> 00:17:06.349
The glorified andointed ones will shine brightly as they work closely with Jesus

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:10.750
to direct the education work that will bring them many to righteousness.

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:18.190
What a joy it will be for them to take part in this amazing work in their role as priests.

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:25.869
They will assist with the healing of the nations. And what a privilege it will be to see obedient

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:39.220
humans become free from the burden of sin and death and gain perfection. Of course, we have to

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:45.859
realize that at that time on earth there won't be just resurrected ones, will they? There'll be the

00:17:45.859 --> 00:17:53.059
survivors of Armageddon and any children that are born in the new world. These ones will ultimately

00:17:53.059 --> 00:18:00.819
attain to perfection. So is that when they get their names written as it were in ink in the book?

00:18:01.619 --> 00:18:10.420
Not quite yet. Why not? Well, because perfection doesn't automatically mean that someone would

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:16.420
get everlasting life. Remember the case of Adam and Eve? They were perfect. But before they could

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:24.339
attain to everlasting life, they had to prove their obedience to Jehovah. Yes. So we realize then

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:31.140
that in the case of Adam and Eve, they failed. So a question is raised with regard to all

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:36.980
these perfect ones on the earth at that time. The resurrected ones, the survivors of the great

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:44.500
tribulation as well as any children that will have been born. Will they stand faithful? Will they

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:52.019
continue to support Jehovah's sovereignty? Or will some of them be like Adam and Eve? Be perfect,

00:18:52.019 --> 00:18:59.859
but then unfaithful? Well, the book of Revelation helps us to understand that to answer that question,

00:18:59.859 --> 00:19:06.740
Satan is released from the symbolic prison and he has an opportunity to test the integrity of

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:15.460
Jehovah's servants. So each person on earth will have a personal opportunity to show where they

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:22.339
stand on the issue of universal sovereignty. And their individual response will show whether or

00:19:22.339 --> 00:19:30.900
not their names should be written permanently in the book of life. Some an unspecified number

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:36.420
will turn their backs on Jehovah and will not support his sovereignty. What will happen to those?

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:43.460
Well, Revelation 20 verse 15 tells us, doesn't it? Anyone who isn't found written in the book of

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:52.099
life will receive everlasting destruction. But this is the good news. The majority of perfect

00:19:52.099 --> 00:20:00.019
mankind will find themselves passing the final test. Yes, and their names will be written

00:20:00.019 --> 00:20:06.900
permanently in the book of life. Isn't that exciting to think about what's going to happen

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:14.180
in the future? Yes, now is the time Jehovah is preparing his people for this massive education

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:20.740
work that is going to take place in the new world. So now's the time for each one of us to think

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:30.019
about that question. Are you there? Is your name in the book of life? Yes, may your name be found

00:20:30.019 --> 00:20:37.619
written in Jehovah's book of life and may it remain there forever.
