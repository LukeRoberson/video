Faith depends on Jehovah's Word, all the things he has said.

00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:35.630
We must live not on bread or loan, live by his word instead.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:47.490
Even though we have peace and joy, future blessings are true.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:01:43.659
We must live not on bread or loan, live depends on Jehovah's Word, all the things he has said.

00:01:43.659 --> 00:02:41.750
When he gives wisdom to call, he treasures with it on top.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:03:58.669
Glad to leave that old Jehovah.

00:03:58.669 --> 00:07:33.990
Like the camp to succeed, so he provides every lane.

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:43.069
There's a need for reaching God.
