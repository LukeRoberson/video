00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:08.539
Welcome. This is my friend Alex RheinmÃ¼ller. Alex is going to help me host our

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:16.539
program which focuses on family. Alex what do we have to look forward to? Thank

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:22.219
you Gerard. I'm delighted to be here with you. For nearly a decade children have

00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:27.300
enjoyed our animated series Become Jehovah's Friend. How have they in their

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.539
parents benefited? As teens, Tanera and Alex developed a strong identity as

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:39.619
servants of Jehovah. We'll learn how this helped them resist temptations. Are

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:44.299
you married or contemplating marriage? You'll enjoy a new series we're

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:49.380
introducing in our program. It's designed to help Christian couples achieve a

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:56.579
happy marriage. I'm eager to get started. This is JW Broadcasting for April

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:24.040
2022. Today we will talk about those who are close to all of our hearts, our

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.760
children. I'm sure that you dear parents greatly love and appreciate your

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:37.719
children. What a privilege it is to have them. Think about it. There are millions

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:44.239
of angels. However, angels were not given the privilege to produce children.

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:50.200
When Jesus was on earth, He was not married, so He did not have the privilege of

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:58.879
having children. But you parents have that privilege. What a treasure. What does the

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:06.640
governing body want to tell you children? That we love you. We are so happy to have

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.919
you with us and we would like to help you to become and remain worshippers of

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:20.080
Jehovah. You are like a beautiful gift, a special gift from Jehovah. Christian

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.360
parents value and appreciate you children more than a million dollars. How do we

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:36.199
know? Because Psalm 127 verse 3 says that children are an inheritance from

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:44.479
Jehovah. What does that mean? An inheritance is a very valuable gift that has been given

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:52.800
to someone. Often the gift is from an older family relative. Jehovah views you children

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:00.360
as a very valuable gift that he has given to your parents. He expects parents to take

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:10.520
good care of this gift. He entrusts parents with welfare and happiness of their children.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:18.479
And when parents do the best for you, it especially makes us happy when you children do your

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:25.479
best to please and serve Jehovah. There are so many children earth-wide who are

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:33.960
fine examples for others by means of their love for Jehovah and the truth. Parents will

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:41.240
your children become good examples for other young ones in the truth? One father of seven

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:47.800
children all of whom grew up as lovers of Jehovah would always tell new parents that there are

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.919
no guarantees with children. They each have their own personality and are exposed to various

00:03:54.919 --> 00:04:01.639
outside influences. But he would always urge new parents to do the best they can to teach

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:08.840
their children and reach their hearts. Your conscientious effort increases the possibility of them

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:17.879
becoming a success in Jehovah's service. So parents, how are you caring for your inheritance?

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:23.800
What are some vital steps to teach and reach the heart of your child?

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:34.569
First, please locate judges 13 verse 8. The parents of Samson

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:43.689
likely prayed often for Jehovah's help to properly raise their son. Verse 8 says,

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:51.930
Manoa pleaded with Jehovah and said, pardon me, Jehovah, please, let the man of the true God whom

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:59.610
you just sent come again to instruct us about what we should do with the child who will be born.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.889
If you parents do the same, Jehovah will answer your prayers through the scriptures,

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:11.129
Bible literature, or possibly by means of a congregation meeting.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:19.529
Additionally, being consistent with family worship is vital to reach the heart of one's child.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.689
It is true that it takes some planning and absorbs some of your time each week.

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:34.490
But remember that in 2008, the governing body gave us all the extra time each week for family

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:41.610
worship by adjusting the weekly meeting schedule. A brother from Portugal wrote,

00:05:42.329 --> 00:05:48.089
aside from family worship, my father had a separate Bible study on a different day with each

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:55.769
of us three children. I'm sure that these studies were very important for us to resist all of the

00:05:55.769 --> 00:06:02.810
pressures at school. It is no surprise that all three children have been in special full-time

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:10.089
service for a number of years now. Similarly, a brother from Northern Italy wrote,

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:17.689
we studied with each one of our children personally in harmony with their age and gender.

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:26.009
Each family head must decide what is best for his family. However, a well-prepared family

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:34.459
worship program is essential. Another excellent way to teach your children is by example.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:42.699
Children often pick up mannerisms from their parents. They often walk and talk like one of the

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:51.100
parents, but they also pick up on godly personality traits and attitudes. So be the kind of

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:58.779
person that you want your child to be. Even though Jesus was the only perfect child ever born on

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:06.060
earth, it appears that his mother Mary and adoptive father Joseph were good examples for him.

00:07:07.019 --> 00:07:15.660
Luke 2.41 and 42 tells us that Jesus' parents were accustomed to go from year to year to Jerusalem

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:23.899
for the Passover. Joseph could have viewed the trip as inconvenient and even too expensive,

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:29.660
but as parents he and Mary said a good example for the young boy Jesus.

00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:39.480
Most young ones can quote 1 Corinthians 1533 by heart. Maybe it is because their parents have

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:50.730
reminded them of the principle so often. Bad associations spoil useful habits. Do you remember

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:57.370
in Luke chapter 8 that Jesus spoke about the different kinds of soil that the word of god might

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:06.649
fall on? The soil represents your child's heart. It is our hope and prayer that your child's heart

00:08:06.649 --> 00:08:17.930
is like good or fine soil. In verse 15 Jesus applied the illustration of the fine soil,

00:08:18.649 --> 00:08:26.250
saying, These are the ones who, after hearing the word, with a fine and good heart retain it

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:33.769
and bear fruit with endurance. But what can happen if after responding to your training from god's

00:08:33.769 --> 00:08:41.690
word your child is somehow exposed to bad association? When young ones spend considerable time

00:08:41.769 --> 00:08:48.730
with other young ones who have not been trained by Bible principles, it can counteract your training

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:57.450
from god's word. Such association is like a severe rainstorm that erodes the fine soil that

00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:02.649
you have built up. It can quickly wash away the good training that you have given.

00:09:03.529 --> 00:09:14.490
1 verse 1 says that we can be happy if we do not walk with, stand with or sit with those who do

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:23.049
what is bad. And we could add to that and to not text or email others who do not think

00:09:23.049 --> 00:09:28.889
hold some thoughts. Help your children to choose good associates.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:37.450
So many young ones around the world have responded to their parents fine instruction and express

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:43.450
themselves from the heart. Let me share a few experiences that demonstrate this.

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:54.570
1 young person from the United States wrote in saying, I am 11 years old and I am an unbaptized

00:09:54.570 --> 00:10:01.289
publisher. I can't thank you enough for all that you do. I especially appreciate all the time

00:10:01.289 --> 00:10:09.929
and effort you put into the Caleb and Sophia videos. I love these videos. They help me to show

00:10:09.929 --> 00:10:18.009
good conduct at school. I am grateful that you encourage family worship. You see, I used to

00:10:18.009 --> 00:10:25.210
have doubts about Jehovah. If it were not for the time at family worship, I probably would have

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:33.610
drifted more and more. I love Jehovah and want to serve him but I still have lots to work on.

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:40.889
I hope you will make more videos to help me and other young ones to serve Jehovah with our

00:10:40.889 --> 00:10:52.389
whole heart and whole soul. We received this message. Hi, I'm 10 years old. I just wanted to say

00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:59.750
thank you. When I grow up, I want to work in Bethel because I love Jehovah and want to make him

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:09.750
happy. In paradise, I want to open a zoo without cages, sending all my love. I recall I once

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:15.830
met an eight-year-old girl in Denver, Colorado, who was baptized at eight years of age.

00:11:16.549 --> 00:11:24.549
By that time, she had read the entire Bible through twice. Of course, each child is unique.

00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:29.669
Not all children become mature at the same rate or at the same point in life.

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:38.629
You may recall that we read Psalm 127 verse three earlier, which said that children are an

00:11:38.629 --> 00:11:48.470
inheritance from Jehovah. Let's read the next verse number four. Like arrows in the hand of a mighty

00:11:48.549 --> 00:11:57.110
man, so are the sons of one's youth. Children are likened to arrows that should be aimed at a target.

00:11:58.149 --> 00:12:05.750
An archer cannot recall an arrow once it leaves his bow. Parents have arrows. They have their

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:14.870
children to aim at the target for a relatively brief time. And what is the target? What is the goal?

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:22.629
For your children to become whole, some dedicated and baptized servants of Jehovah.

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:29.750
However, arrows can be made from different materials, and they can vary in size.

00:12:30.789 --> 00:12:35.590
Parents must remember that no two children are precisely alike.

00:12:37.029 --> 00:12:42.549
Some have a good measure of mental and emotional maturity at a young age,

00:12:42.549 --> 00:12:50.230
and express a desire to get baptized. Others may not be ready for baptism until they are a bit older.

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:59.990
Thus, discerning parents do not pressure their children to get baptized. Rather, they assist each

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:08.070
child in keeping with his or her own growth and spiritual progress. But it is also true that

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:15.350
some parents underestimate their children. Some hold them back from dedicating their life to

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:21.350
Jehovah, even though they have developed a close relationship with him as a youngster.

00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:25.990
We received this comment from a sister in Russia.

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:34.070
Thank you very much for taking care of younger ones. A particularly appreciate your support.

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:43.110
Your loving words inspired me. I am 17. I am invigorated by articles and videos which are

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:51.509
prepared by you. Your work and love bring me to tears. Thank you very much.

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:59.909
I am touched by your affectionate care of us here in Russia. Your warm words and prayers are

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:06.870
the best comfort for us. I am grateful to you. Thanks to you taking care of me,

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:16.870
I was able to begin pioneering two years ago. It's the best life ever. I am happy. I can't be silent.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:24.470
I am filled with gratitude. The Watchtower once commented, it has been said that raising children

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:33.269
is a 20-year project, but parents never really stop being parents. Among the very best things

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:42.230
you can give to your children are love, time, and Bible-based training. Yes, endeavouring to

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:49.029
reach their hearts. Admittedly, each child will respond differently to the training.

00:14:49.669 --> 00:14:57.509
However, many who have been raised by parents that love Jehovah feel like do I know my sister in

00:14:57.509 --> 00:15:05.269
Asia, she says. Looking back on the training I received from my parents, I am so thankful

00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:12.149
that they disciplined me and taught me to love Jehovah. They did not just give me life,

00:15:12.149 --> 00:15:20.389
they gave me a meaningful life. And there are millions of adult Christians who would express

00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:29.539
similar sentiments of appreciation. Parents, take care of your inheritance, your precious children

00:15:29.539 --> 00:15:36.820
by training them and reaching their heart. Thank you for those encouraging comments,

00:15:36.899 --> 00:15:41.139
Garrett. I especially appreciated all the comments from the young ones.

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:48.820
One in particular expressed appreciation for the Caleb and Sophia videos. We've grown quite

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:54.500
attached to these characters, haven't we? In our next segment, Brother Anthony Morris of the

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:59.620
governing body discusses how this series has helped children and their parents.

00:16:13.799 --> 00:16:21.720
It's hard to believe it's been almost a decade since that first release in 2012.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:31.159
In that time, the Become Jehovah's Friends series has proved to be a real gift from Jehovah.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:39.960
Through these Bible lessons, children can learn to be kind, to be honest, to be respectful,

00:16:40.759 --> 00:16:48.600
and to develop other godly qualities that help them see and obey the one who is invisible.

00:16:49.799 --> 00:16:57.240
How can we begin to understand the far-reaching impact this series has had on Christian families?

00:16:58.759 --> 00:17:05.880
We're going to let Christian parents tell how these videos have helped their children to become

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:15.019
Jehovah's Friends. Katie Ann had a really hard time working together with the older brothers and

00:17:15.019 --> 00:17:24.019
sisters in the congregation. I had a really hard time because they're kind of slow,

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:31.619
but lessons 25 making friends was just what I needed.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:37.380
We spent a few weeks discussing the videos during our family worship evening.

00:17:37.539 --> 00:17:45.859
The videos helped her to be more open-minded, be more respectful to the elderly brothers and sisters

00:17:45.859 --> 00:17:53.210
and want to work with them in field service. So feel like chatting with sister Elsa,

00:17:53.849 --> 00:18:02.890
even though she's so old, so I can do that too. These videos strengthened my relationship with Jehovah.

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:11.369
I know that he hasn't forgotten me as a single parent. It can be so hard for single parents

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:21.480
because they're trying to take on the role of both parents. I got baptized because I loved Jehovah

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:30.039
with my whole heart. Jehovah still loves me even though I made from dust and I'm so little.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:45.299
It took some of the way off my shoulders. Laura, our middle child, was perfectly healthy

00:18:46.019 --> 00:18:50.660
until she turned four years old. That's when she was diagnosed with a rare tumor

00:18:51.539 --> 00:18:57.380
in her central nervous system. Unfortunately, when the treatment was over, Laura passed away.

00:19:01.819 --> 00:19:08.700
Even while she was sick, she just loved watching the videos. Her favorite one was let's go in service.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:15.660
This video really made her want to talk about Jehovah. During the time that she was receiving

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:21.500
chemotherapy treatments, we lowered her immunity. We couldn't even leave the house with her,

00:19:24.579 --> 00:19:27.539
but sometimes we'd bring her to get a checkup or get an exam done.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:33.539
And the doctor would say that everything was fine for now that her immunity was okay,

00:19:33.539 --> 00:19:38.579
and the very first thing that she'd say to the doctor was, so I can go with the ministry, right?

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:45.140
And the doctor would laugh and say, sure, you can. And our family would take advantage of those

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:51.700
times to go and feel service together as a family, all together that made Laura so happy.

00:19:55.829 --> 00:20:02.309
It does us good to remember why the become Jehovah's friend series was created.

00:20:03.269 --> 00:20:12.869
These videos were not designed as mere entertainment to simply pacify children for a short period

00:20:12.869 --> 00:20:21.750
of time. These lessons were designed to help children build a relationship with Jehovah so they can

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:33.190
live and serve him forever. Jehovah loves children. That love was evident in how his son Jesus

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:45.029
Christ treated children. The governing body shares that love as well. Also, Jehovah loves Christian

00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:52.150
parents. He sees how hard you work to impress a love for God deep in your child's heart.

00:20:54.380 --> 00:21:01.660
No doubt, you look forward to sharing every new video with your child to help them learn to love

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:11.900
and respect Jehovah, Jesus, and God's Word. But more important, how do you think Jehovah feels?

00:21:12.859 --> 00:21:20.700
Knowing that a young child can come to know him through this animated series and grow up to become

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:33.180
his dedicated servant, that is truly special. We will continue to pray that this series

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:41.500
reaches the hearts of our young ones and draws them closer to Jehovah, their friend now and forever.

00:21:46.779 --> 00:21:52.700
As we heard, become Jehovah's friend is much more than an enjoyable animated series.

00:21:53.579 --> 00:21:59.660
These videos are powerful teaching tools that help young ones develop a personal relationship with

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:05.819
Jehovah. Parents, continue to use them wisely as part of your family worship.

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:12.380
Of course, at some point in their lives, children must make the truth their own.

00:22:13.339 --> 00:22:18.779
What steps can they take to establish their identity as a servant of Jehovah?

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:24.299
That's the topic of the next episode of My Teen Life.

00:22:34.859 --> 00:22:40.619
Me and my mom started attending meetings and studying the Bible when I was five years old.

00:22:40.619 --> 00:22:43.500
When I was 13, I decided to get baptized.

00:22:45.339 --> 00:22:48.700
I decided to dedicate my life to Jehovah when I was 14.

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:56.700
To me, Jehovah is a wonderful God. He's not just a friend who can count home but also a father.

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:03.339
I don't have a spiritual father here on earth, but I have Jehovah as my father.

00:23:05.619 --> 00:23:10.980
It was always something that I had in mind to let the truth convince me that not to serve

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:16.740
Jehovah just because my family does. To serve Jehovah because of the love I feel for him,

00:23:16.819 --> 00:23:22.420
having that clearly in mind is very important and will make all the difference when a problem arises

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:28.019
or we have to deal with something in the future. Some of the truths that convinced me that

00:23:28.019 --> 00:23:37.059
Jehovah was really my God were mainly basic truths. I believe that they're like the foundation of a house

00:23:38.019 --> 00:23:43.380
without a good base, good foundation, a house will not remain standing.

00:23:43.779 --> 00:23:52.180
For example, I wanted to understand better from a more scientific standpoint that Jehovah really

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:59.140
created all things. So I read a lesson from the brochure origin of life. From that I saw how

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:06.420
Jehovah really made everything in a very complex way and that there was no other explanation.

00:24:07.059 --> 00:24:13.859
It was doubts like that that moved me to study the Bible more and helped me to build a better

00:24:13.859 --> 00:24:18.819
friendship with Jehovah and to be more convinced that he was the true God.

00:24:20.019 --> 00:24:25.140
I always enjoyed and made a great effort to feed myself in a spiritual sense in the morning.

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:29.539
When I was a teenager I went through some problems that were pretty tough.

00:24:30.819 --> 00:24:36.339
I felt better in the morning. It was a time of day when my problems didn't seem so big

00:24:36.339 --> 00:24:44.339
in my mind. It's very important to have spiritual goals because if we don't have goals it's like

00:24:44.339 --> 00:24:51.619
going on a journey with no direction, no destination. If you've got a purpose before leaving we know

00:24:51.619 --> 00:24:56.819
where we're going and how we can get there safely. I always think in terms of setting short range

00:24:56.819 --> 00:25:02.740
goals, medium range goals and long range goals. So some goals that I was able to reach were

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:08.259
getting baptized and becoming a regular pioneer. I also had the privilege of serving in construction

00:25:08.259 --> 00:25:14.339
groups no matter the choices I had to make. I always thought about how they would affect my goals

00:25:14.339 --> 00:25:22.900
in the future. When I was 17 I found out that my mum had cancer. It was a heartbreaking situation.

00:25:24.259 --> 00:25:32.259
Suddenly my life was turned upside down. I had to learn how to care for a home, how to cook,

00:25:32.259 --> 00:25:36.660
how to care for someone sick and how to give emotional support to that person.

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:45.140
The biggest challenge I faced when I was a teenager was when my parents got divorced and then

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:53.539
my mum stopped serving Jehovah. At that time in my life I was 15, 16 years old. At that age you

00:25:53.539 --> 00:25:59.299
need a lot of support and guidance from your parents. It was a time when I didn't get that guidance,

00:25:59.299 --> 00:26:08.569
that support. My mum was my best friend and I lost her. She was always so loving.

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:18.650
She always helped me. She always read the publications with me. We love to study the Bible together.

00:26:22.059 --> 00:26:29.500
We don't know when problems will suddenly come up. So it's important that we take Jehovah's

00:26:29.579 --> 00:26:38.869
side before the challenges, before problems arise. A text that really helped me was Romans 8,

00:26:38.869 --> 00:26:46.549
verse 37 to 39. There it says that neither death nor life nor height nor death,

00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:52.869
not anything else can separate us from Jehovah's love. So that really helped me face those

00:26:52.869 --> 00:27:01.750
challenges. Having a strong Christian identity means having values and principles that are the same

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:09.670
as Jehovah's. You clearly make up your mind to please Jehovah, even with what's happening all

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:15.509
around you. It's very important to make the choice to serve Jehovah no matter the situation we face,

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:23.750
no matter if our family serves Jehovah or not, because it's when we face challenging situations

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:29.750
that we'll see if we can continue to be loyal to Jehovah or not. No doubt about it. I'm very

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:37.349
proud to be one of Jehovah's witnesses. Jehovah can help us in an amazing way. He's our friend,

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:44.630
our father, our comforter, and it's really good to be friends with a God that is so powerful.

00:27:45.670 --> 00:28:14.779
And have the chance to defend his name. Establishing your identity as a Christian isn't a single

00:28:14.779 --> 00:28:24.299
decision or a moment in time. As Tainara and Alex shared, it's a process that leads to wonderful

00:28:24.299 --> 00:28:33.180
blessings. In many respects, marriages like that, a wedding is a special day, but marriage is

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:42.059
something that wives and husbands need to strengthen every day. To help Christian couples,

00:28:42.059 --> 00:28:50.539
the governing body has approved the development of a new series. It's called for a happy marriage.

00:28:52.140 --> 00:29:01.019
Each segment features dramatizations of real marital challenges and how Bible principles can help us

00:29:01.019 --> 00:29:29.579
build healthy, loving relationships. Here's our first episode. As married couples,

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:50.759
most of us have been there. The day-to-day pace of life, work, distractions can cause us to draw

00:29:50.759 --> 00:30:18.279
away from our mate emotionally. We begin to talk less, distance ourselves, we may feel unappreciated

00:30:28.099 --> 00:30:35.849
and even become cold or unkind. Even our desire for intimacy and affection may cool.

00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:49.509
We may go from loving and passionate to platonic roommates. What can we do to avoid this?

00:30:52.569 --> 00:30:57.450
An excellent principle we can apply is found at Acts 2035.

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:09.609
There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving, but how can we know what to give?

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:23.299
What actions to take so our mate feels our love and affection? The best way to know is simply to ask,

00:31:25.589 --> 00:31:41.420
what does our mate need? Some feel loved when they are actively listened to or hear warm

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:50.339
expressions of appreciation. For others its expressions of love shown through touch or simply

00:31:50.339 --> 00:31:58.059
quality time. Others find that helping them with chores and sharing the workload at home

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:04.410
makes them feel cherished. But whatever the discussion reveals

00:32:05.609 --> 00:32:17.740
and regardless of our mate's imperfections, we want to do what we can to make them feel loved

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:35.990
and cared for. Through the actions they appreciate. Yes, if we each do all we can to show on

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:52.539
selfish love, genuine affection will follow. And this is just one of many secrets

00:32:54.059 --> 00:33:07.480
to a happy marriage. So now why not just take a moment, pause the video and ask each other

00:33:07.559 --> 00:33:15.559
these three questions. Remember, share your honest feelings and when listening don't be defensive.

00:33:16.839 --> 00:33:20.359
This is simply a chance to openly express how each of you feels.

00:33:22.119 --> 00:33:34.170
So pause your video now and really talk. As we see this series is designed to encourage couples to

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:39.930
have open and honest discussions with each other. His videos will be so helpful for

00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:45.930
husbands and wives and for those who are thinking about getting married. We are thankful to the

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:53.690
governing body for this series and we look forward to future episodes. Whether we're married or single,

00:33:53.690 --> 00:34:00.410
have children or not, all of us are part of Jehovah's family. We love each other and help one

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:08.250
another, especially during times of distress. In our next segment we'll see how Jehovah's spiritual

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:18.699
family helped brother Bastion Nurenda endure years of intense hardship. In the mid-1960s,

00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:25.659
when I was pioneering, the political system was changing rapidly in the country, making it

00:34:25.659 --> 00:34:34.469
difficult for brothers to maintain their neutral stand. Brothers were beaten, their bibles and literature

00:34:34.469 --> 00:34:42.150
bent for refusing to buy political party cards. They bent down the brothers' homes and kingdom

00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:50.389
in my area. I was stopped because of not having a political party card. They tied my hands

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:59.349
and started beating me severely. When they went to have supper, one stayed behind to guard me.

00:35:00.309 --> 00:35:08.150
He felt very sorry for me and said they will kill you when they return. So he suggested that

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:15.829
if I can be able to at least crawl, they knew the entire me and allow me to escape. It was

00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:22.230
dark outside and I dragged myself along until I reached the brothers' home who kindly assisted me.

00:35:23.269 --> 00:35:32.150
Jehovah made a way out so that I could enjoy. An official announcement was made that the wake of

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:43.130
the over-switnesses was banned. Our meetings were done at night from about 9 p.m. to about 1 a.m.

00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:51.530
in the morning. That is to avoid detection. We are not able to clap hands when things go well

00:35:51.530 --> 00:36:01.769
or sing songs because for that we would be found. But to show appreciation, we just had to rub hands

00:36:01.769 --> 00:36:09.929
together. At my workplace, it became known that I was one of the over-switnesses and was arrested.

00:36:09.929 --> 00:36:17.130
I was taken to Chile prison and later transferred to Zomba prison where they kept condemned criminals.

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:25.130
I was kept in a cell next to the execution gallows. I thought I was also going to be executed as well.

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:34.650
Jehovah came to me and remembering Romans 8.8. I was convinced that even this would not separate me

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:43.929
from God's love. When I was raised, I was so happy to be with my wife and the children. But because

00:36:43.929 --> 00:36:50.889
it was extremely dangerous to stay in Malawi at that time, we had to go to Mozambique in Nulangani

00:36:50.969 --> 00:36:57.050
camp where we spent three years as refugees. We were permitted to have bibles,

00:36:57.050 --> 00:37:02.969
songbooks and other publications. When we looked back at what happened at Malangani camp,

00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:11.849
we see that it was Jehovah helping us to prepare for the things I hate. We had to memorize

00:37:11.849 --> 00:37:19.610
scriptures and also think them songs. For the scriptures, for example in 1974, the Eatex was

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:27.289
taken at Hebekuk 3, 1718. And we say it in say that the Eatex for me, I will exhort in Jehovah.

00:37:27.289 --> 00:37:35.050
I will be joyful in the code of my salvation. We didn't know how helpful this text would be in the

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:44.090
future. Because of civil war in Mozambique, we were forced back to Malawi in 1975. I was arrested

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:51.449
and sent to the Reka prison. We had to work from morning to evening without food or rest.

00:37:51.449 --> 00:37:57.929
Cell blocks were overcrowded with most of us sleeping on the floor. The scriptures and songs that we

00:37:57.929 --> 00:38:04.969
had memorized were where we were at Malangani refugee camp in Mozambique. We are really

00:38:04.969 --> 00:38:12.650
very strengthening to us when we are in the Reka prison. And this for the time when that

00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:20.889
Eatex that we received in Mozambique helped us. The brother would say, have backook and then the

00:38:20.889 --> 00:38:29.849
other one would reply 3, 1718. And then the others had to recite the weights of these verses.

00:38:30.489 --> 00:38:38.250
With that, our faith was strengthened. Spiritual food was smuggled into the country by

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:46.010
bicycle couriers who were traveling hundreds of kilometers. The magazines were printed on Bible

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:53.369
paper, which is much lighter than the regular paper so that the couriers could carry double the

00:38:53.369 --> 00:39:01.929
amount. We also were supplied with the mini magazines that could be folded and be put into

00:39:01.929 --> 00:39:10.090
a pocket. One day we received the smuggled copy of the Eatex which used to also contain the daily

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:21.690
text. So what we did was that we copied all the text on the 20th tissues and then we sent some of

00:39:21.769 --> 00:39:30.170
these to our sisters who were on the other prison blocks. All these were wonderful provisions from

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:42.969
the over that helped us quite a lot to be kept spiritually strong. In 2002, I was sent back to

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:54.980
Mozambique prison. But this time, not as a prisoner, but as a district overseer to care for

00:39:56.019 --> 00:40:05.940
a mini sect assembly. When I entered, my mind quickly went back to 33 years when I was in the same

00:40:06.019 --> 00:40:18.309
prison next to the extrusioned glass. Through the weights that I was at 54, the 17 came true,

00:40:18.309 --> 00:40:26.550
which says no weapon formed against you will have any success. As a family,

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:33.909
violated the eye, how injured government persecutions, refugee camps, prisons,

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:44.230
meetings, like a food and shelter, the days of loved ones, and at times thinking would die

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:52.630
ourselves. Yet, we were never beyond the reach of those living on. Through all of these challenges,

00:40:52.630 --> 00:41:04.789
we were under continued to be fully convinced that nothing can separate us from God's love.

00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:15.750
How faith strengthening to see how the brotherhood was a powerful source of encouragement for brother

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:23.269
Nirenda. Of course, persecution continues to affect many of our brothers today. Jehovah's

00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:28.869
spiritual family steadfastly praise for and helps each one of them endure.

00:41:30.469 --> 00:41:37.590
Next, we'll enjoy a recent morning worship presented by brother William Mallonfont. He describes

00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:47.750
the power of parental training. I think all of us have had very interesting experiences with

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:55.190
young ones and we could go on quite a while speaking about them. But there is a story about a child

00:41:55.190 --> 00:42:06.070
psychologist who began his practice with four theories and no children. Some years later,

00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:15.860
he found that he had four children and no theories. He learned that there was quite a bit to do.

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:22.500
It was a lot to do to raise a child. It was far more than just a few theories. And this was a

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:28.500
comment that was reported by psychologist Bruce Neuromor and published in the awake of April

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:37.940
the 8th, 1981. So theories about child raising come and go. And the best counsel on raising a child,

00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:43.300
of course, is found in the Bible. We know that because it's been there for thousands of years

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:51.219
and it's consistent. It's consistently successful. There's another interesting point that there

00:42:51.219 --> 00:42:58.179
is four times as much counsel given to children in the book of Proverbs as given to adults.

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:02.500
That might surprise you, but that's what I read. So I believe it.

00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:13.380
Proverbs 226 is a familiar scripture for all of us. Proverbs 226. And here it says,

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:24.059
a boy in the way he should go, even when he grows old, he will not depart from it. Is that true?

00:43:25.179 --> 00:43:31.739
Yes, it's true. Does it mean that in every case a boy that's well-trained by his parents won't

00:43:31.739 --> 00:43:39.739
depart from it? No, does not mean that. It's giving a general overall view of what will take place

00:43:39.739 --> 00:43:46.860
if a child is trained properly by his parents. And what it is, this is an interesting brief statement,

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:54.219
excuse me, from the watchtower of 2008, April 1st. If a child is trained according to the

00:43:54.219 --> 00:44:02.300
Bible's counsel, the parent or parents are creating the most favorable circumstances to bring about

00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:09.260
a marvelous result. That marvelous result is a faithful servant of Jehovah God.

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:18.699
And we can turn to Proverbs 23-24 where reference is made to that. Proverbs 23-24 and how many

00:44:18.699 --> 00:44:24.860
parents are so delighted with their children, especially in the case of so many who are serving at

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:32.219
Bethel. There at Proverbs 23-24, it says, the Father of a righteous one will surely be joyful.

00:44:33.659 --> 00:44:40.219
Whoever fathers a wise son will rejoice in him. And it does. It brings great pleasure to parents

00:44:40.219 --> 00:44:46.380
when that happens. But there's another side to the coin. Despite the most earnest efforts of

00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:56.889
parents, some children do become unfaithful. Think about Solomon. He wasn't a child, but it actually,

00:44:56.889 --> 00:45:02.409
it's very difficult to understand how that man turned away from Jehovah in his old age, but he did.

00:45:03.289 --> 00:45:09.610
And then even Jehovah had sons who proved unfaithful. That's what the June 1st 2007 watchtower

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:14.010
showed clearly and were all familiar with it, the angels who turned away from their Father,

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:20.570
their Creator. And it's something to keep in mind for parents particularly who have really tried

00:45:20.570 --> 00:45:27.610
hard to raise their children properly. We don't want to see them beat themselves, figuratively speaking,

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:33.690
on and on for years and years because they feel like they're failures. They should not do that.

00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:38.570
How do you account if it seems to some parents that know somehow they fail,

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:43.929
but then how do you account for children who receive no help whatsoever from their parents?

00:45:43.929 --> 00:45:50.170
And they love Jehovah and they come into the truth. It's heart, heart condition.

00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:57.050
So parents would be wise to focus on the future and what they can do not to look back and

00:45:57.050 --> 00:46:04.090
beat themselves over problems of the past. And even when children do turn aside from serving Jehovah,

00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:10.010
parents who have conscientiously trained their children in the way to walk,

00:46:10.889 --> 00:46:16.969
they can still entertain the hope that those young ones will come back someday. We never give up

00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:23.690
on our kids. We don't give up on our close friends or siblings who may have walked away from

00:46:23.769 --> 00:46:29.610
the truth. We always hope that they'll come back. Psalm 19.7 is interesting.

00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:38.329
Psalm 19.7, speaking of the reminders of Jehovah,

00:46:39.769 --> 00:46:45.289
if there it reads, the law of Jehovah is perfect, restoring strength. And then it says,

00:46:45.289 --> 00:46:51.369
the reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy, making the inexperienced one wise.

00:46:52.329 --> 00:46:58.170
Well, those who leave the truth, many times it's reminders that come back to them,

00:46:58.170 --> 00:47:04.409
the way it was at home, the counsel they receive from their parents, the loving congregation

00:47:04.409 --> 00:47:10.809
that they attended. And who comes to mind when you think about the reminders coming to mind

00:47:11.449 --> 00:47:18.889
after living a life of debauchery, the prodigal son? He was at his lowest and then who did he

00:47:18.889 --> 00:47:26.489
remember? His father, his father who undoubtedly had shown kindness and love to him. So we don't want

00:47:26.489 --> 00:47:32.730
to overlook the power there is in parental training. Even though they may not respond,

00:47:33.289 --> 00:47:39.530
children may not respond immediately. They do many times later on. And they go through experiences

00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:46.489
in life sometimes that wakes them up to the facts of life and reality. The truth is there are

00:47:46.489 --> 00:47:51.849
thousands upon thousands of children of Jehovah's Witnesses who are being raised in the truth and

00:47:51.849 --> 00:47:57.530
whose way is pure and right. It really is thrilling to see young ones who they're able to think.

00:47:57.530 --> 00:48:01.610
They don't just parrot what their parents tell them. They're not just memorizing things.

00:48:02.090 --> 00:48:07.289
They've learned to have thinking ability and they can speak about the truth. They defend the truth

00:48:07.289 --> 00:48:15.050
in a very interesting way. In Britain, Tim and Sam, both 11 years old and unbaptized publishers were

00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:20.650
engaging in field service with Tim's mother. The boys needed new bags to carry their

00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:28.010
bibles in literature, but money was a problem. Earlier, before starting in the field service that day,

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:34.889
the mothers of the two publishers made this a subject of prayer. At the last house to be visited

00:48:34.889 --> 00:48:41.050
that morning, Tim spoke to the householder and read a Bible verse to her. She interrupted him to

00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:47.690
ask what his religion was. When Tim replied that he was one of Jehovah's Witnesses, the woman

00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:53.289
scolded him and said to his mother that she could not understand why Jehovah's Witnesses let their

00:48:53.289 --> 00:48:59.769
children die rather than allow them to accept blood transfusions. That would be a difficult thing

00:48:59.769 --> 00:49:05.610
to have thrown in your face, a young man there at the door with his mother. Tim's mother suggested

00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:13.530
that the woman asked the boys how they felt about this. She did. Tim explained that he would

00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:19.929
always choose alternative treatment rather than go against his Bible-trained conscience. This was

00:49:19.929 --> 00:49:28.090
from this young boy himself. Sam then said, the other young boy, that his own sister had received

00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:36.489
alternative treatment and had fared better than patients who had received blood. Then the householder

00:49:36.570 --> 00:49:42.570
again turned to Tim's mother. In this time, she expressed disapproval of taking young children

00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:49.289
from door to door. We've heard that many times, I'm sure. Both of the boys responded to the woman

00:49:49.289 --> 00:49:55.130
on this occasion that they enjoyed preaching, adding that they preferred this to roaming the streets

00:49:55.130 --> 00:50:01.530
like others of their age. Well, they slowed the householder down a bit. She was impressed by their

00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:06.090
reply. The householder asked the boys to wait a moment while she went into her house.

00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:13.449
What a surprise they had when she returned and presented each of them with a smart new leather

00:50:13.449 --> 00:50:21.050
bag ideal for their ministry. She sold these items for a living. Her changed attitude also allowed

00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:28.090
the boys to arrange for a return visit. And as they were leaving, the householder's 94-year-old

00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:34.809
mother, who had been listening, came to the door and asked Tim's mother to visit her at her home.

00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:42.409
Truly, we are proud of our young ones. And it's a delight when you hear them make comments

00:50:42.409 --> 00:50:48.570
at the meetings in their own words and you out in the field ministry with them and you see them

00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:55.690
make expressions of faith. We have thousands upon thousands of good children who really are

00:50:55.690 --> 00:51:03.289
showing that they're mature and they loved Jehovah God. In our program, we have been reminded

00:51:03.289 --> 00:51:12.570
that each of us belongs to a loving, global family, Jehovah's family. And as our new music video

00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:17.210
shows, each of us can help others become part of our spiritual family.

00:51:17.289 --> 00:55:35.030
What an encouraging video and an appropriate one for this month's broadcast, which has been

00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:40.389
all about family. Alex, thank you for being my co-host.

00:55:40.389 --> 00:55:47.349
You're welcome, Garrett. In our program, we were reminded that our animated series,

00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:53.510
Become Jehovah's Friend, is a very effective teaching tool that continues to delight

00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:59.670
in health children and parents. We learned how teens can develop a strong identity as a servant of

00:55:59.670 --> 00:56:07.110
Jehovah and how this helps them stand firm for their convictions. And we introduced an encouraging

00:56:07.110 --> 00:56:13.590
new series for a happy marriage and we were reminded of the importance of showing our marriage

00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:20.869
made affection. Now it's time for our video postcard, which comes to us from Zambia.

00:56:22.550 --> 00:56:30.230
Situated in South Central Africa, Zambia is a land of vast open spaces, abundant wildlife

00:56:31.349 --> 00:56:39.349
and spectacular waterways. It takes its name from the Zambizi River, which flows into Victoria Falls.

00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:46.550
Particularly at flood stage, Victoria Falls is considered the largest sheet of falling water on

00:56:46.550 --> 00:56:57.510
earth, with up to 144 million gallons or 545 million liters plunging over the falls every minute.

00:56:58.789 --> 00:57:04.869
In the past, Jehovah's Witnesses in Zambia faced strong opposition fueled by nationalism.

00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:11.750
During the 1960s, thousands of children of Jehovah's Witnesses were expelled from school

00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:18.070
for refusing to salute the flag, door to door preaching was bad. But with Jehovah's help,

00:57:18.789 --> 00:57:26.630
the brothers persevered and many have embraced the truth. Today, Zambia is home to more than

00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:34.309
225,000 Jehovah's Witnesses. To serve publishers and areas with poor network service,

00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:39.829
the circuit overseer pre-records his talks, transfers the files onto a flash drive,

00:57:40.469 --> 00:57:44.550
and delivers the files to the elders who then distribute the talks.

00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:48.949
Let's visit the Lusaka Rockfield congregation.

00:57:50.550 --> 00:57:55.989
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the brothers showed great zeal in the ministry.

00:57:56.869 --> 00:58:02.630
The congregation grew to the point that a new congregation was formed to support the territory.

00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:07.429
Attendance at meetings and assemblies during the pandemic was strong.

00:58:08.389 --> 00:58:12.070
Young ones in the congregation helped translate kingdom songs.

00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:18.869
Our brothers and sisters in the Lusaka Rockfield congregation in Zambia

00:58:18.949 --> 00:58:21.510
send you their love and greetings.

00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:26.630
And we send our love to all of you as well.

00:58:27.909 --> 00:58:33.750
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
