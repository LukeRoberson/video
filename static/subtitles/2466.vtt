00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:17.800
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:25.519
I want to sing to Jehovah just like Deborah did.

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.519
What inspired her to sing?

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.519
Come on, let's have her tell us.

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.520
It's a great story.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.520
Hi everyone, it's me, Deborah.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.520
During my time, the Israelites were very afraid.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:46.340
Some even left their villages to hide.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.340
Who were they afraid of?

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.340
This guy, Cicera.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.340
He was chief of the Canaanite Army.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.340
They were all big bullies.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.739
But was I afraid?

00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:09.739
Now with Jehovah on my side.

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:11.739
Look, there I am.

00:01:11.739 --> 00:01:13.739
I was a prophetess.

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:18.739
And Jehovah gave me good news to tell Israel's new leader,

00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:20.739
Beirak.

00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:26.739
I reassured him when you face Cicera, Jehovah will help you win.

00:01:26.739 --> 00:01:34.280
I received courage from Jehovah.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:44.180
And that gave Beirak and the Israelites courage as well.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:53.430
Jehovah defeated Cicera just like he promised.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.430
And that's why I was singing.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.430
Listen you kings to Jehovah, I will sing.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.319
Jehovah's friends show courage.

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:12.319
Why not read the whole story and let Deborah's example encourage you?

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.319
Make time every day to learn from Jehovah's friends.

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.319
What do you think?

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.319
How did Deborah show that she was Jehovah's friend?

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.319
When is it hard for you to be courageous?

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.319
How can you help a friend be courageous?
