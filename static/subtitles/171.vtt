00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:09.779
The theme for this month's program is appreciating our gifts and men.

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:16.280
Who of us does not enjoy being given a fine, well-chosen gift?

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.280
For example, you brothers.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:27.280
Do you not take pleasure in receiving a colorful, but tasteful, 100% silk tie?

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:34.280
Are you sisters? Do you not delight in being given an exquisite, charming silk scarf?

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:43.280
But what if you took that silk tie or silk scarf and used it to polish your shoes?

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:51.280
How do you think the giver of your gift would feel if he saw you using his gift in that way?

00:00:51.780 --> 00:01:00.280
Obviously, it would be misused and disrespect for the gift and would insult the giver.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.280
What is the point of our illustration?

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:12.780
Will Jehovah and Jesus have given us a fine, well-chosen gift in the form of the elders?

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:24.780
But as we will discuss, all of us must make sure that we always show appreciation and respect for this divine provision.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.780
Please turn to Ephesians chapter 4 and verse 8.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.780
And let's read about this gift that Jehovah and Jesus have given us.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:47.780
It reads, for it says, when he ascended on high, he carried away captives.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.780
He gave gifts in men.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:00.780
You notice, by means of Jesus' perfect integrity, Jesus conquered Satan and his world.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:11.780
As a world conqueror, figuratively, he has plundered captives and has given them his gifts to the congregations.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.780
How useful are these gifts in men?

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.780
Well, please look at verses 11 and 12 for the answer.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:29.780
And he gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelizers, some as shepherds and teachers.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:40.780
And the view to the re-adjustment of the holy ones for ministerial work to build up the body of the Christ.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:50.780
Notice, they would be evangelizers taking the lead in the all-important preaching and disciple-making work.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.780
They do not simply say to the publishers, go in the preaching work.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.780
They come, come with us.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.780
Let's work together in this never-to-be-repeated work.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:14.780
They are also shepherds, protecting the flock from Satan, the murderer, serpent, dragon, and lion.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:22.780
Additionally, they are teachers, feeding the flock with nourishing spiritual food.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:30.780
Now we ask, how does Jehovah tell us that we should feel about these hard-working gifts in men?

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:37.780
Let's go to 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 and let's get the answer.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.780
1 Thessalonians 5, beginning in verse number 12.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.780
Notice what Jehovah says.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:04:07.780
We request you, brothers, to show respect for those who are working hard among you and presiding over you in the Lord and it monitoring you and to give them extraordinary consideration in love because of their work.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.780
Be peaceable with one another.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:18.779
Notice, we're told to show respect for these dear brothers.

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:22.779
But now let's move to a vital question.

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:31.779
How can we show, demonstrate, that we do deeply respect and appreciate these dear brothers?

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:37.779
The first way, by wholeheartedly cooperating with them.

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:43.779
Please turn to Hebrews chapter 13 and verse number 17.

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:50.779
In this scripture describes how deep our cooperation should be.

00:04:50.779 --> 00:05:00.779
Verse 17, be obedient to those who are taking the lead among you and be submissive

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:10.779
for they are keeping watch over you as those who will render an account so that they may do this with joy and not with sign.

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:16.029
For this would be damaging to you.

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:20.029
Notice, we are told to be obedient.

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:26.029
Clearly, this means that we're supposed to comply with or obey what they tell us.

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:32.029
Of course, that would be with a proviso unless they tell us to do something that is unscriptual.

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:36.029
And of course, that would be extremely rare.

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:40.029
We're also told to be submissive.

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:51.029
This includes the attitude with which we're to be obedient, doing so with a yielding, positive attitude.

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:56.029
Would it be possible to be obedient, but not submissive?

00:05:56.029 --> 00:06:03.029
Well, what if we said, okay, I'll do what the elders suggest.

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:08.029
I don't want to do it, but I'll do it.

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:12.029
We would be obedient, but not submissive.

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:18.029
However, Jehovah tells us to display both of these qualities.

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:29.029
We should be obedient and submissive, even if what the elders are asking us to do is not the best, most efficient way to do something.

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:32.029
Permit me to illustrate this point.

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:40.029
Admittedly, the illustration is somewhat exaggerated, but hopefully it will make the point.

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:48.029
Please imagine that the elders decide that the outside of the kingdom hall needs to be painted,

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:56.029
and that all the publishers will be given a small two-inch paintbrush with which to paint.

00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:58.029
Now, what could happen?

00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:05.029
The publishers could get all upset concerning this request of the elders saying,

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:11.029
it is ridiculous that the elders want us to paint with a small two-inch paintbrush.

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:20.029
Consequently, some could start campaigning for the right for everyone to use a six-inch paintbrush.

00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:28.029
Others might campaign for using paint rollers to roll the paint on the kingdom hall.

00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:39.029
Still others might start trying to build support for renting and using a paint sprayer to spray the paint on the kingdom hall.

00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:48.029
In another camp, once might champion the idea of hiring out to a contractor, the painting of the kingdom hall.

00:07:48.029 --> 00:07:56.029
While another group is promoting the idea that the kingdom hall doesn't even need to be painted.

00:07:56.029 --> 00:07:59.029
Now, what would be the outcome?

00:07:59.029 --> 00:08:02.029
The congregation would be divided.

00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:05.029
The kingdom hall would never get painted.

00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:09.029
Publishers could end up stumbled right out of the truth.

00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:12.029
The elders would be very discouraged.

00:08:12.029 --> 00:08:19.029
Jehovah would be sad, and Satan would be made very happy.

00:08:20.029 --> 00:08:25.029
On the other hand, what if everyone humbly supported the elders?

00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:32.029
Perhaps thinking there's no scripture that says we can't paint with a two-inch paintbrush?

00:08:32.029 --> 00:08:40.029
In fact, Hebrews 13, 17 tells us to be obedient and submissive to the elders.

00:08:40.029 --> 00:08:44.029
So why don't we go ahead and support the elders?

00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:47.029
Now, what would be the outcome?

00:08:47.029 --> 00:08:50.029
The kingdom hall we get painted.

00:08:50.029 --> 00:08:59.029
The publishers would get to enjoy a lot of good association because they'd be working together for a long time.

00:08:59.029 --> 00:09:02.029
The elders would be very encouraged.

00:09:02.029 --> 00:09:10.029
Satan would be sad, and Jehovah's heart would be made glad.

00:09:10.029 --> 00:09:15.029
Well, what is the point of this hyperbole illustration?

00:09:16.029 --> 00:09:24.029
Being obedient and submissive to those taking the lead is much more important than how something is done.

00:09:24.029 --> 00:09:30.029
That is the attitude that Jehovah will richly bless.

00:09:30.029 --> 00:09:40.029
But now, a second way we can demonstrate that we deeply appreciate these dear brothers is to pray for that.

00:09:40.029 --> 00:09:51.029
Please note what the elder Paul urged the brothers to do for him at Romans chapter 15, verse number 30.

00:09:51.029 --> 00:09:53.029
Here Paul said,

00:09:53.029 --> 00:10:10.029
Now, I urge you brothers through our Lord Jesus Christ and through the love of the Spirit that you exert yourselves with me in prayers to God for me.

00:10:10.029 --> 00:10:19.029
Paul recognized the power that he would derive as a result of others praying for him.

00:10:19.029 --> 00:10:23.029
And your local elders feel the same way.

00:10:23.029 --> 00:10:38.029
But the question is, in your personal private prayers, do you regularly thank Jehovah for your gifts and men and entreat Jehovah to richly supply them with his powerful Holy Spirit?

00:10:38.029 --> 00:10:48.029
Our answer to that question can reveal much about our appreciation for these hardworking elders.

00:10:48.029 --> 00:10:55.029
Now, let's move to a third way that we can demonstrate deep appreciation.

00:10:55.029 --> 00:11:00.029
We can do so by commending the elders.

00:11:00.029 --> 00:11:03.029
Here is a soul searching question.

00:11:03.029 --> 00:11:08.029
Do you periodically go up to various elders and say something like,

00:11:09.029 --> 00:11:14.029
Brother Elder, we just want to thank you for your hard work.

00:11:14.029 --> 00:11:18.029
Please be assured that we appreciate it.

00:11:18.029 --> 00:11:28.029
However, it seems that some publishers never ever commend the elders or express appreciation.

00:11:28.029 --> 00:11:34.029
Might this not indicate that we are taking them in their hard work for granted?

00:11:35.029 --> 00:11:39.029
Of course, they will not quit if you do not give them commendation.

00:11:39.029 --> 00:11:43.029
They primarily do their work for Jehovah.

00:11:43.029 --> 00:11:51.029
But if you do express appreciation, believe me, it will be most encouraging to them.

00:11:51.029 --> 00:12:03.029
And even though it may really surprise the elder the very first time you do this, please do not hold back this good from those to whom it is owing.

00:12:04.029 --> 00:12:19.029
Appropriately, Jehovah tells us that Proverbs 327 do not withhold good from those to whom you should give it if it is within your power to help.

00:12:19.029 --> 00:12:27.029
And one thing that will move us to be more aware of commending the elders is to remember all the good work they are doing.

00:12:27.029 --> 00:12:34.029
Many elders are family men who must work securely to provide for their families.

00:12:34.029 --> 00:12:41.029
If he has children, these young ones need time and attention from their father.

00:12:41.029 --> 00:12:50.029
He may need to help them with their schoolwork, as well as schedule time for them to enjoy wholesome recreation.

00:12:50.029 --> 00:12:55.029
Most important, he cares for the spiritual needs of his family.

00:12:55.029 --> 00:13:03.029
Regularly conducting family worship, working with them in the ministry and taking them to meetings.

00:13:03.029 --> 00:13:14.029
But in addition to these numerous responsibilities common to many of us, they have voluminous additional responsibilities as elders.

00:13:14.029 --> 00:13:21.029
And much of the elders' hard work in our behalf is not seen by the congregation.

00:13:21.029 --> 00:13:25.029
For example, you may see an elder giving a part on the meeting.

00:13:25.029 --> 00:13:31.029
What you didn't see are the hours he spent preparing that part.

00:13:31.029 --> 00:13:39.029
How long does it take you to prepare a student assignment on the midweek meeting?

00:13:39.029 --> 00:13:44.029
Some elders have a part every week, sometimes more than one.

00:13:45.029 --> 00:13:56.029
While gaining experience and speaking is certainly helpful, the fact remains that good talks require hard work.

00:13:56.029 --> 00:14:05.029
But that is not all the elders do. They have shepherding costs to make, and judicial cases to handle.

00:14:05.029 --> 00:14:17.029
Some elders are also busy helping to build kingdom halls and branch facilities serving on hospital liaison committees, volunteering at assemblies and conventions.

00:14:17.029 --> 00:14:24.029
And elders do many other things that are too numerous to recount.

00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:35.029
What we see is often only the tip of the iceberg. 90% of an iceberg is unseen underwater.

00:14:35.029 --> 00:14:47.029
At 2 Timothy 4-6, the Apostle Paul referred to himself as being poured out like a drink offering.

00:14:47.029 --> 00:14:53.029
A drink offering was poured on the altar and went up in smoke.

00:14:53.029 --> 00:15:00.029
That well describes how the elders likewise expend themselves.

00:15:00.029 --> 00:15:11.029
Remembering all of this should move us to regularly offer sincere commendation to our hardworking elders.

00:15:11.029 --> 00:15:20.029
Now, we have discussed ways that we can demonstrate that we deeply appreciate our gifts and men.

00:15:20.029 --> 00:15:26.029
We should, number one, wholeheartedly cooperate with them.

00:15:26.029 --> 00:15:29.029
Number two, pray for them.

00:15:29.029 --> 00:15:32.029
Number three, commend them.

00:15:32.029 --> 00:15:47.029
Thereby, we will prove that we are not even slightly like an unappreciative recipient of a silk tie or a silk scarf who uses that gift to polish his shoes.

00:15:47.029 --> 00:16:05.029
To the contrary, we will prove to Jehovah and Jesus that we love respect and appreciate the divine gifts or gifts and men that they have so generously given to us.
