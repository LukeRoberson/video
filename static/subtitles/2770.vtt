00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:08.349
So, as Christians, what is our position where political matters are concerned?

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:11.230
We are neutral.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.550
Sometimes people misunderstand this viewpoint.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.510
Some have concluded that because we don't promote one human government, that we must be

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.629
promoting another human government.

00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:26.870
In the 1950s, in what is now the Republic of Congo, authorities falsely accused Jehovah's

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.589
witnesses of being communists.

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:35.189
But during the 1970s, when Congo adopted a communist form of government, the new authorities

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:38.990
found fault with us for not being communists.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.149
Today, however, and for nearly three decades, Jehovah's Witnesses have enjoyed legal status

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.030
in the Republic of Congo.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.030
And whereas some have perceived our Christian neutrality as sheer apathy, others can

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.390
screw our position as a threat.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.909
Let's address both of these viewpoints.

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:04.750
First, there is a big difference between Christian neutrality and apathy.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.870
Apathy is defined as a lack of interest, enthusiasm or concern.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.469
We certainly don't lack interest in people, nor are we insensitive to their feelings.

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:19.870
Like Jesus, we strive to alleviate people's suffering by helping them in practical ways,

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.030
while teaching them about the only kingdom that can eliminate injustice.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.829
By teaching people from God's word, we endeavor to change hearts, not political institutions.

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.629
We feel this approach is realistic because mankind's main problems are not political, but

00:01:38.629 --> 00:01:41.069
moral.

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:46.909
But why can it be said that Jehovah's Witnesses are not a threat, but rather an asset?

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.790
We conscientiously obey the laws.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.549
We support our communities through volunteer service or compulsory civilian service where

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.750
that exists, and we pay our taxes.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.030
It's true we don't vote for political parties or candidates, but neither do we disrupt

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.549
elections or interfere with those who choose to vote.

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.870
It's true we don't lobby, campaign or run for government office, but neither do we criticize

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.909
those in power, undermine their policies, or demonstrate for political change.

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:24.110
It's true we won't salute a flag, but neither will we burn a flag, spit on a flag, or

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.469
disparage the nation that a flag represents, even in lands where these are considered protected

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:33.550
expressions of freedom.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.590
It's true we don't sing national anthems, but neither do we discourage others from singing,

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.990
nor do we make a public spectacle of not singing.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.469
We simply don't participate.

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:48.030
It's true we wouldn't kill people in war.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.990
But neither would we attack people at home.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.830
So while we don't promote any political position, neither do we condemn any political position.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.550
Even in our heart, that is what neutrality means.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.750
We don't take sides.
