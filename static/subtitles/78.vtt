00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:08.259
Welcome. This is JW Broadcasting for January 2021.

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:37.950
On Saturday, October 3rd, the Watchtower Bible and Track Society of Pennsylvania held its annual business meeting via video conferencing.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:46.950
In normal times, after we care for that necessary business, we share spiritual encouragement in a larger meeting.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.950
However, we're not living in normal times.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.950
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we had to readjust our plans.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:05.950
However, the good news is we did not cancel the spiritual portion of the program.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.950
You likely already enjoyed Brother Heard's talk in October about the 2021 year text.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.950
If not, we encourage you to do so.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.950
In addition, the governing body assigned me to be the chairman for the 2020 annual meeting.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:31.950
And I'll also be the anchor for this month's and next month's JW Broadcasting programs.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:39.950
We're happy that in this month's broadcast, you'll see the first part of that spiritual portion of the annual meeting.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.950
It begins with a special musical prelude. Please enjoy.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:12:41.740
The annual meetings of the Watchtower Bible and Track Society of Pennsylvania have been held for many years, in fact, since January 1885.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:48.740
They have been held in different states in the US and in 1983 in Britain.

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:55.740
This year, 2020, the corporate meeting is being held by video conference.

00:12:55.740 --> 00:13:00.740
The spiritual program has been recorded for the benefit of the brothers all over the earth.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:06.019
This is a historic annual meeting.

00:13:06.019 --> 00:13:12.019
In the past, we have had some historic annual meetings, for example.

00:13:12.019 --> 00:13:24.019
At the annual meeting held on October 2, 1944 in Pittsburgh, the members of the Pennsylvania Corporation adopted six resolutions amending its charter.

00:13:24.019 --> 00:13:36.019
The charter had provided that voting shares be issued to contributors of funds to the society's work, but the third amendment eliminated that provision.

00:13:36.019 --> 00:13:53.019
Thereafter, directors of the society were to be voted into office by individuals who were fully devoted to Jehovah, irrespective of the amount of money that they contributed to advance the Kingdom work.

00:13:53.019 --> 00:14:00.019
After the historic annual meeting in 1944, a vital question remained.

00:14:00.019 --> 00:14:09.019
Since the governing body was then closely identified with the Pennsylvania Corporation's seven member board of directors,

00:14:09.019 --> 00:14:23.019
did this mean that the governing body could never be made up of more than seven anointed Christians? Moreover, since the directors are elected by the members of the corporation,

00:14:24.019 --> 00:14:32.019
were the corporation members electing members of the governing body at the annual meeting each year?

00:14:32.019 --> 00:14:42.019
Are the directors and officers of the Watchtower Bible and Track Society of Pennsylvania and the members of the governing body one and the same?

00:14:42.019 --> 00:14:48.019
Or are they different? These questions were answered years later.

00:14:48.019 --> 00:14:58.019
They were answered at the annual meeting held on October 1, 1971, another historic annual meeting.

00:14:58.019 --> 00:15:11.019
On that occasion, one of the speakers pointed out that the governing body preceded the Watchtower Bible and Track Society of Pennsylvania by hundreds of years.

00:15:12.019 --> 00:15:21.019
Now, contract to some who opposed Jehovah and the earthly part of his organization and claim there was no governing body in the first century,

00:15:21.019 --> 00:15:36.019
and hence they see no need for a governing body today. A governing body was formed at Pentecost of 33 CE, more than 18 centuries before the Pennsylvania Corporation came into existence.

00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:49.019
At first, the governing body consisted of 12 apostles. Its number was enlarged later for the apostles and older men in Jerusalem were taking the lead.

00:15:49.019 --> 00:15:58.019
Now notice what happened later here in the Bible book of Acts and chapter 15.

00:15:58.019 --> 00:16:09.019
So other issues had been handled by the 12 apostles, but now with this circumcision issue that came up amongst the congregations.

00:16:09.019 --> 00:16:19.019
Notice what we read here in verse 2 of Acts 15. But after quite a bit of dissension and disputing by Paul and Barnabas with them,

00:16:19.019 --> 00:16:31.019
it was arranged for Paul, Barnabas, and some of the others to go up to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem regarding this issue.

00:16:31.019 --> 00:16:45.019
So the issue was going to be settled by the first century governing body, and now it's larger than the apostles, it included the elders and the apostles in Jerusalem.

00:16:45.019 --> 00:16:52.019
Now what is the benefit of following the direction from the governing body in the first century?

00:16:52.019 --> 00:17:04.019
By extension today, notice in Acts 16, verse 4 and 5, they're carrying the decree there, and it mentions as they traveled on through the cities,

00:17:04.019 --> 00:17:15.019
they would deliver to them for observation, observance, excuse me, the decrees that had been decided on by the apostles and the elders who were in Jerusalem.

00:17:15.019 --> 00:17:27.019
Now notice then indeed the congregations continued to be made firm in the faith and to increase in number day by day.

00:17:27.019 --> 00:17:43.019
Not beautiful, there was a governing body, they didn't have a need for legal entities to advance the kingdom work in the first century, but they did indeed need a governing body.

00:17:43.019 --> 00:17:50.019
As long as conditions in this world permit, the governing body will make use of legal entities.

00:17:50.019 --> 00:17:58.019
If a legal entity is dissolved by a government decree, the preaching work will still go on.

00:17:58.019 --> 00:18:13.019
Even now, in lands where restrictions are in effect and no legal entities are used, the kingdom message is being proclaimed, disciples are being made, and theocracy's increase continues.

00:18:13.019 --> 00:18:21.019
In the midst of this pandemic, the preaching continues, many experiences are happening globally.

00:18:21.019 --> 00:18:40.019
Now one I received and confirmed from two elders serving at Warwick Bethel, I think you'll appreciate so much going on and so many nice experiences with a health care system that operates dozens of hospitals across the United States, and many of them were COVID hot spots.

00:18:40.019 --> 00:18:48.019
They wanted to publish a video interview featuring two frontline health care workers in one of the hospitals.

00:18:48.019 --> 00:18:54.019
Well it happened that the two nurses they chose were the interviews, were our brothers.

00:18:54.019 --> 00:19:04.019
They were asked to supply pictures of the family. One of the pictures had been taken before the pandemic in front of a paradise scene in one of our assembly halls.

00:19:04.019 --> 00:19:11.019
Now the woman coordinating the video interviews told the brother that she recognized that scene.

00:19:11.019 --> 00:19:21.019
So he asked her if she was a witness. She replied, no, but I studied with the witnesses and I know it's the truth.

00:19:21.019 --> 00:19:25.019
I can see how close we are to the end.

00:19:25.019 --> 00:19:35.019
The brother then told her that be happy to know that the second nurse whom she had interviewed the day before was also a witness.

00:19:35.019 --> 00:19:39.019
Then the woman burst into tears.

00:19:39.019 --> 00:19:47.019
She said it made sense that the two nurses selected for this interview would both be witnesses.

00:19:47.019 --> 00:19:53.019
I can see it in your approach and the belief in something bigger than this.

00:19:53.019 --> 00:19:57.019
And she said she planned to resume her Bible studies.

00:19:57.019 --> 00:20:05.019
We pray for this woman and all the wonderful experiences happening as the preaching goes on during this pandemic.

00:20:05.019 --> 00:20:14.019
So this is all happening because Jehovah's Witnesses plant and water and God keeps making it grow.

00:20:14.019 --> 00:20:19.019
All glory goes to Jehovah.

00:20:19.019 --> 00:20:25.019
At this meeting, as was pointed out last year with the announcement about the Ramapo project,

00:20:25.019 --> 00:20:30.019
you will learn that the faithful slave is not slowing down.

00:20:30.019 --> 00:20:37.019
We have more work to do until Jehovah says the preaching work is finished.

00:20:37.019 --> 00:20:44.019
As we look to the future, we are confident that Jehovah will care for the spiritual and material needs of his people.

00:20:44.019 --> 00:20:53.019
He and his son Jesus Christ will continue to provide the heavenly direction and support needed to complete the kingdom preaching work.

00:20:53.019 --> 00:21:02.609
We therefore begged Jehovah for his spirit to finish the work he has given us.

00:21:02.609 --> 00:21:10.609
While Jehovah's organization here on earth is legally established and it bides by governmental requirements for its business meetings,

00:21:10.609 --> 00:21:15.609
this organization is bound by a higher power.

00:21:15.609 --> 00:21:23.609
Before he left the earth, Jesus told his followers, go make disciples teaching them.

00:21:23.609 --> 00:21:25.609
But he did even more.

00:21:25.609 --> 00:21:34.609
Jesus promised that during the time of the end, we would also receive food at the proper time to help us fulfill that commission.

00:21:34.609 --> 00:21:37.609
Has Jesus kept his promise?

00:21:37.609 --> 00:21:50.750
Please watch the following video. It is entitled Go Teaching Them.

00:21:50.750 --> 00:22:01.750
Everyone who remains to be a Christian, and I have dedicated himself to Jehovah God, must not only preach, but he must be able to teach.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:08.750
We must go into the homes of the people and teach them what the Bible says.

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:20.690
We needed a book that could be used effectively in conducting Bible studies, one that would cover the basic doctrines and truths.

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:33.130
Many years ago, in the Bethel dining room, after the noon meal, Brother Norr read off a list of 15 to 20 brothers' names, who were to report it as office immediately.

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:41.130
And they were told to write a new study book using simple, everyday language, just as they would present basic Bible truths to someone at the door.

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:48.130
Well, within months, that book was written, printed, and released, as let God be true.

00:22:48.130 --> 00:23:00.380
That book made even a new publisher feel confident. It was like having a bombshell in our hands, capable of blowing to bits all of the false doctrines.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:13.380
At one house, I conducted studies in that book for 15 years with different people, first a woman, next a family, then some young people.

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:22.380
Finally, another woman, six people in all got baptized using that book.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:30.380
Still, some struggled to finish this, and the even more detailed impossible to lie book, and to make progress.

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:37.809
By the late 1960s, a book was needed that got right to the point.

00:23:37.809 --> 00:23:54.119
They called it the blue bomb, and it was a game changer. It was written in a simple, clear, and appointed way so that any sincere reader could understand it.

00:23:54.119 --> 00:24:03.119
I used to deal drugs. I wanted to change, but I didn't know how. Then, my manager gave me the truth book.

00:24:03.119 --> 00:24:14.119
I was immediately convinced I had found the truth and the real meaning of life. From then on, everyone who came looking for drugs got a truth book instead.

00:24:14.119 --> 00:24:20.710
By the early 1980s, the field needed something new.

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:27.710
Could a book be produced at the same level as the Bible stories book, but with the information presented in the truth book?

00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:41.769
I had no Bible studies at all. Now, I have three, and a fourth one ready to start. Thank you.

00:24:41.769 --> 00:24:50.769
I was studying with a man who had been smoking for 17 years. Then he started to read the live forever book. That did it.

00:24:50.769 --> 00:24:56.339
Any book that powerful shouldn't go to waste sitting on the shelf.

00:24:56.339 --> 00:25:05.339
Only a decade later, the world had changed. In some lands, so many wanted to study that they were put on a waiting list.

00:25:05.339 --> 00:25:07.339
Other lands faced a different problem.

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:30.890
The liver ever book helped me to love Jehovah, but the knowledge book helped me to make the decision to serve him.

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:43.740
My husband studied the knowledge book while he was working in Poland. He loved it so much that he translated it into Mongolian and sent it to us.

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:50.740
Soon, we were all baptized. My husband then joined the real Mongolian translation team.

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:58.630
Still, we needed a book that not only sped up disciples making, but also touched the heart.

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:14.339
This book has an instant appeal that quickly draws households into a conversation. Some are calling it the gold nugget.

00:26:14.339 --> 00:26:20.619
I was searching for something to fill the emptiness that we both felt in our lives.

00:26:20.619 --> 00:26:27.619
I was being trained by one of Jehovah's Witnesses, and she said, feel free to read whatever I have in my toolbox.

00:26:27.619 --> 00:26:33.619
I opened it and immediately a little yellow book. What does the Bible really teach caught my eye?

00:26:33.619 --> 00:26:45.619
The scriptures and the beginning of the book. They touched my heart immediately, and I felt like these answer all the questions I've been searching for my entire life.

00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:57.289
Publication in Thailand. What can the Bible teach us?

00:26:57.289 --> 00:27:08.259
It was like having a bombshell in our hands.

00:27:08.259 --> 00:27:14.259
It really touched the heart, and it helped bring many into the truth.

00:27:14.259 --> 00:27:24.259
I found answers to all my questions in just one book. This book was sent from God.

00:27:24.259 --> 00:27:28.259
The best teaching tool I have ever been privileged to use.

00:27:28.259 --> 00:27:37.119
We thought this was the book, and the only book, and that there never could be another.

00:27:37.119 --> 00:27:46.289
Many of you have used every one of those publications over the years.

00:27:46.289 --> 00:27:51.289
Like me, you have felt that each one was a great instrument for its time.

00:27:51.289 --> 00:27:57.289
But we're not stuck in the past. We look to the future.

00:27:57.289 --> 00:28:01.289
What is the future of discipl making?

00:28:01.289 --> 00:28:09.940
Listen, as Brother David explained, delivers the talk, wouldn't it be great?

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:18.940
The year text for 2020 was about the preaching work. Go! Make disciples baptizing them.

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:32.940
Now, in harmony with that theme, the governing body directed that a number of study articles should be prepared for the study edition of the Watchtower on the ministry, and particularly about conducting Bible studies.

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:41.940
Then, at the regional convention this summer, why almost the entirety of Saturday was dedicated to the discipl making work? Why?

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:55.940
We don't just want to report Bible studies. We want to make disciples. That's what Jesus told us to do. Go! Make disciples baptizing them.

00:28:55.940 --> 00:29:07.220
Now, when it comes to reporting Bible studies, we're doing very well. Worldwide, we're reporting about 10 million Bible studies.

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:19.220
And when you think of it, in many cases, more than one person is sitting in on that study. So it could be that between 12 and 15 million people are studying the Bible with us.

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:30.220
But now, what about the make disciples part of it? Well, every year between 200 and 300,000 people are baptized.

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:38.220
So you can see that the make disciples part is lagging behind the reporting Bible studies part.

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:43.220
Now, this trend has been a concern of the governing bodies for a number of years.

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:51.220
And we wondered, why is it that so many people are not taking a stand for the truth?

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:59.220
You can probably think of a number of reasons yourself. Some people, for example, are quite happy to learn what the Bible teaches.

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:08.220
But they're not willing to act on what the Bible teaches. They're not willing to make drastic changes in their life.

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:20.220
Some may have studied through a whole book or maybe two, but they haven't been to a single meeting. Maybe one. Maybe the memorial once.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:34.220
Well, they make us think of something that Jehovah told the Israelites back in the days of Ezekiel. I'd like you to turn to Ezekiel chapter 33.

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:40.220
And we're going to read verse 32. Now, this was a description of the Israelites in Ezekiel's day.

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:49.220
But I think you'll find that the description fits pretty well a few of our Bible students. Ezekiel 33, I'll give you a moment.

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.220
And we're going to read verse 32.

00:30:52.220 --> 00:31:05.980
Look, you are to them like a romantic love song sung with a beautiful voice and skillfully played on a stringed instrument. But then notice this.

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:12.980
They will hear your words, but no one will act on them.

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:27.980
Doesn't that describe some of our Bible students? Or maybe the Sunday isn't regular. Maybe it isn't consistent. Maybe the student often cancels or maybe the publisher often cancels.

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:33.980
Well, if a study isn't regular, it's pretty hard for the person to make progress, isn't it?

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:43.980
And in many cases, kindhearted publishers just can't bring themselves to stop the study when no progress is being made.

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:51.980
Or they may say, if I stop the study, I won't have a study. I like having a Bible study.

00:31:53.420 --> 00:32:05.420
Well, we're talking about progressive Bible studies, and that's a challenge. It's not easy to conduct a progressive Bible study. There are so many factors to consider.

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:09.420
For example, how early do I bring in prayer?

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:21.420
How do I direct interest to the organization? How early should I mention the meetings? And what do I do if my Bible student doesn't show up at the meeting?

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:32.420
What about opposition? That can be tricky. Bring it up too soon, and you might scare them off. Wait too long, and it may be too late.

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:50.420
And what about the ministry? How do I encourage my Bible student to share what he is learning with others? These are a lot of challenges, and don't even mention helping my Bible student to break a bad habit like smoking.

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:57.420
Wouldn't it be great if we could get some help with some of these things? Here's more food for thought.

00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:02.420
How do I make sure that the material is really touching the student's heart?

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:17.420
I want that student to love Jehovah, to get to know Jehovah. I want him to have a warm personal relationship with Jehovah, so that no one, neither the boss, nor his relatives, nor his mate, nor his neighbor,

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:32.420
will be allowed to come between my student and Jehovah God. Here's another thing. We're conducting a Bible study, and we want to focus on the scriptures. Jesus said the seed is the word of God.

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:45.420
So now, how do I draw my student out as to his feelings about this scripture? Maybe he understands what the scripture says, but how does he feel about what he is learning?

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:51.420
Wouldn't it be great if some of those questions were prepared for us?

00:33:51.420 --> 00:34:01.420
Bible students also have challenges in their personal life. Wouldn't it be great if we could bring someone on our study who has gone through a similar situation to the students?

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:07.420
Who understands what the student is going through? That would really take the pressure off, wouldn't it?

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:20.420
And how can you evaluate the progress of the student? How do I know if the student is steadily working toward becoming an unbaptized publisher and then getting baptized?

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:31.420
Here's another thing. One of the reasons why it takes so long for some to make progress is that there are two books and a brochure to go through. That's a lot of reading.

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:51.420
And when you think of it, a lot of our students have never opened a book since they left school. So for them, this is a big change. Some get baptized before they've covered the second book, and that's a pity, because they're losing out on practical information on Christian living that they really need to have.

00:34:51.420 --> 00:35:04.420
And then some of our brothers and sisters are not even using the Jehovah's will brochure to direct interest to the organization that Jehovah's will brochure, what's that? Exactly.

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:20.420
Wouldn't it be great if in just one book we could cover all the basic doctrinal matters, all of the matters about Christian living and direct people's interest in the organization in just one book?

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:33.420
That truly would be great. Well, maybe right now you're saying, all right, I understand we do need some help with this, but what are you doing about it? I'll tell you.

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:44.420
In April 2018, the service committee of the governing body surveyed the branches to find out what teaching methods were really effective in bringing people along to baptism.

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:57.420
We have to admit that some of the study material and teaching methods that were used 30 years ago, they were great for the time, but they don't necessarily meet the needs of people today.

00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:13.420
Well, they got some good answers in, and based on the answers, early in 2019, a team of brothers, there were writers, there were designers and consultants, they got together to investigate whether we could improve on the tools that we're using.

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:19.420
And they came up with a new method for conducting studies.

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:30.420
Now let's stop here and be very clear. We deeply appreciate all of the study material that we've had over the years. It's always been great for the times.

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:44.420
Now maybe like me, you cut your teeth on, let God be true. This means everlasting life. The truth shall make you free. Those books were just perfect for the period just after World War II.

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:59.420
And then we know that the live forever book was a real favorite with many. How it wasn't the study forever book, it was the live forever book, but some took on not a long time to complete their study in that book.

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:14.420
And of course, we've all appreciated the Teach Us book and remain in God's love. All of this material has been very, very good, but times change, and people's needs change as well.

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:25.420
We're living in a visual society, and people learn less by reading than by observing, by watching, and by discussion.

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:45.929
So, what are we saying? Are you ready? Today, the governing body is happy to announce that a brand new publication for conducting Bible studies will soon be made available in printed form and in electronic form.

00:37:45.929 --> 00:37:48.929
Would you like to know the title? It's a good one.

00:37:48.929 --> 00:38:12.619
Enjoy life forever and interactive Bible course. The title is taken from Psalm 2226. Those seeking Jehovah will praise him. You may you enjoy life forever.

00:38:12.619 --> 00:38:23.619
Isn't that nice? Isn't that a nice text? Now, how was the course put together? Well, the branches sent in all of their comments, and they were good comments.

00:38:23.619 --> 00:38:37.619
And then the writers got busy, and they analyzed the comments that were sent in by the branches. And on the basis of those comments, three sample lessons were prepared.

00:38:37.619 --> 00:38:49.619
Now, the lessons looked good on paper, but when they work in the field, to find out, those lessons were sent to 97 different countries for field testing.

00:38:49.619 --> 00:39:02.619
And the results were very encouraging. So, all 60 lessons in the book were sent to the field for testing.

00:39:03.619 --> 00:39:14.619
Now, the question may come up, were the testers? Did you get all the circuit overseers, the missionaries, the special pioneers together, and have them test the material?

00:39:14.619 --> 00:39:31.619
Well, there were some of those, but not all circuit overseers were not all missionaries or special pioneers. So, a wide variety of brothers and sisters were used in this test. Some were quite new in the truth, and others had been in the truth for quite some time.

00:39:32.619 --> 00:39:49.619
The result is the publication that will soon be made available. Now, what's different about this course? I'm not going to go into much detail because Brother Jackson is going to handle that, but here are a couple of points. First of all, very important.

00:39:50.619 --> 00:40:00.619
All of the information that's required to answer the 60 questions for baptismal candidates is covered thoroughly in this book.

00:40:00.619 --> 00:40:15.619
All of the information needed, that's Bible topics, Christian living topics, directing interest to the organization, it's all thoroughly covered in just one book.

00:40:15.619 --> 00:40:22.619
You do not repeat, you do not have to study a second book.

00:40:22.619 --> 00:40:36.619
What's the format like? Well, it's somewhat similar to the midweek workbook, and you'll see that it's organized in a way that there can be a free discussion between the student and the conductor.

00:40:36.619 --> 00:40:53.619
In each lesson, there are just a few introductory paragraphs that the student is invited to read ahead of time, but most of the lesson will be handled between the conductor and the student. It will be a discussion.

00:40:53.619 --> 00:41:03.619
The material will focus on the scriptures. A typical sentence might read this scripture, then answer these questions.

00:41:03.619 --> 00:41:14.619
And the questions are provided. The electronic copy of the book has links to some 200 different videos that you can read you can have you during the study.

00:41:14.619 --> 00:41:24.619
Remember the problem of having somebody along on the study who has gone through the same problems as the student has problem solved.

00:41:24.619 --> 00:41:34.619
You just look up a video interview and play that for the student, and no doubt he will glean a great deal of benefit from it.

00:41:34.619 --> 00:41:46.619
At regular intervals, taxful reference is made to sharing the truth with others. A typical question, how would you explain what you just learned to a friend?

00:41:46.619 --> 00:41:55.619
At the end of every lesson, the student is given a goal that he can work toward, and that way will help him to evaluate his progress.

00:41:55.619 --> 00:42:11.619
And Jehovah's qualities are a showcase throughout the book. We want the student to realize that Jehovah loves him very much, and that Jehovah's feelings are influenced, affected by the decisions that the student makes.

00:42:11.619 --> 00:42:18.619
And that way, he will cultivate a warm personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:42:18.619 --> 00:42:28.619
Well, we humans are creatures of habit, aren't we? We've used the simple question and answer method for many, many years in conducting Bible studies.

00:42:28.619 --> 00:42:37.619
And it has met the needs in the past. But in our communication with the branches, it has become obvious that something else is needed.

00:42:37.619 --> 00:42:44.619
So ask Jehovah to help you to get used to this new method, and use it. You'll be glad you did.

00:42:44.619 --> 00:42:56.619
We pray that Jehovah will bless our efforts to use this tool. And wouldn't it be great if, when you use it, you're not only studying with people, but make disciples of them?

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:07.050
Thank you, Brother Splain. What an exciting announcement.

00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:16.050
Brother Splain asked, wouldn't it be great if you could make a disciple? That is a great thought.

00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:30.460
How do you feel though about learning this new way of conducting Bible studies? Are you excited? Are you eager to start? Or are you a little uneasy?

00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:43.460
Brother Jeffrey Jackson is going to help you see how you can confidently use our new book on Bible studies. His talk is entitled, yes, it would be great, but...

00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:54.789
Wouldn't it be great? Yes, it would be great, but we have a lot of questions, don't we?

00:43:54.789 --> 00:44:08.789
The first question is, do we hear that correctly? That not only are we receiving a new publication, but we're also starting a new method of conducting Bible studies?

00:44:08.789 --> 00:44:21.789
The answer is yes. But why is that necessary? Well, to answer that question, let's think of a few things that have changed in recent years.

00:44:21.789 --> 00:44:35.789
For example, think about the New World Translation and the revision of the New World Translation. Was that revised because the reference Bible was no longer any good? No.

00:44:35.789 --> 00:44:50.789
We remember the explanation given that reading skills of people have changed. No longer do people enjoy reading and taking that slow journey to eventually get to a destination.

00:44:50.789 --> 00:45:03.789
But rather, this modern age, we find that people are wanting to get to the destination very quickly. They want clear, simple explanations that give them the meaning quickly.

00:45:03.789 --> 00:45:19.789
But what if the governing body, when they were considering whether or not to revise the New World Translation, had said, but we can't do this because the brothers and sisters would have to learn a whole lot of new vocabulary.

00:45:19.789 --> 00:45:28.789
And all their favorite scriptures, they'd have to memorize again, and they probably wouldn't be able to find those verses on the right page in the Bible.

00:45:28.789 --> 00:45:40.789
But the governing body didn't decide that, not to have the revision. But rather, we saw how Jehovah blessed the revision of the New World Translation.

00:45:40.789 --> 00:45:53.789
And haven't we been happy using this and getting the benefits from it? But not only have reading skills changed, but also learning skills.

00:45:53.789 --> 00:46:09.789
And that's shown by some of the adjustments that have been made to our midweek meeting. Now we see our midweek meeting is fast moving, it's interesting, and it seems so much easier to learn things about the Bible.

00:46:09.789 --> 00:46:28.789
Recently I was talking to a sister who has been in the truth for about 65 years, and she said concerning the midweek meeting, I have learned more about the Bible in the last few years than in the previous 60 years. And isn't that true?

00:46:28.789 --> 00:46:40.789
But what if the governing body when they were considering this change had said, well, we can't make that change because the older brothers and sisters won't be able to adapt to it?

00:46:40.789 --> 00:46:50.789
Aren't we happy that the change was made? Of course we are, because we can see the beautiful benefits that have come from that change.

00:46:50.789 --> 00:47:04.679
When we think about all these changes that have occurred, we can see that it fulfills what Jehovah promised, and if you turn with me please to the book of Isaiah.

00:47:04.679 --> 00:47:12.679
Isaiah chapter 60, and let's remind ourselves of what is said in the beginning of verse 17.

00:47:12.679 --> 00:47:28.679
Here Jehovah promises, instead of the copper, I will bring in gold, and instead of the iron, I will bring in silver, instead of the wood, copper, and instead of the stones, iron.

00:47:28.679 --> 00:47:42.679
Doesn't this describe nicely the promised Jehovah has made to help us to keep improving the various things that we are doing with preaching the good news, and also our spiritual feeding programs?

00:47:42.679 --> 00:47:56.679
Yes, things continue to improve, but let's also remember how verse 16 in the same chapter starts. It says, and you will actually drink the milk of nations.

00:47:56.679 --> 00:48:08.679
We probably remember that the Watchtowers helped us to understand that this milk of the nations involves all the things that are being developed, including modern technology.

00:48:08.679 --> 00:48:18.679
And Jehovah's people with Jehovah's blessing have used many of these modern things to help us with teaching and preaching.

00:48:18.679 --> 00:48:28.679
Yes, as Brother Splain said very accurately, times change, and people's needs change, and that's very true.

00:48:28.679 --> 00:48:34.679
As we've seen, reading skills have changed, and learning skills have too.

00:48:34.679 --> 00:48:42.679
So for that reason, over the last few years, our Bible study tools have changed slightly.

00:48:42.679 --> 00:48:52.679
We've seen how they've become simpler, easier to use, and many of us are using videos along with these publications.

00:48:52.679 --> 00:48:59.679
But of course, sometimes it gets a little complicated because we're not quite sure what video to show when.

00:49:00.679 --> 00:49:08.679
How refreshing it was when we saw that the digital version of the Good News brochure had videos embedded in it.

00:49:08.679 --> 00:49:14.679
So you're able to tap on the video and have the right video at the right time when you're conducting a study.

00:49:14.679 --> 00:49:27.679
Well, this new publication takes all of this experience that we've gained from trying to enhance our Bible study tools, and now we have something that will be very easy to use.

00:49:28.679 --> 00:49:32.679
But what does the publication look like?

00:49:32.679 --> 00:49:42.679
And Brother Splain mentioned it had been field tested, so those who have already used it, what did they say about this new publication?

00:49:42.679 --> 00:49:46.679
And how does the governing body feel about this new publication?

00:49:46.679 --> 00:49:50.679
All those questions are answered in this video.

00:49:50.679 --> 00:49:59.110
Jehovah has always given us the right tool at the right time to teach others.

00:50:01.489 --> 00:50:13.150
And this new book is no exception. How is this book organized?

00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:20.150
Each lesson is divided into three parts. How do you use it to conduct a Bible study?

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:30.150
You might encourage your student to read the first part of a lesson in advance and to note the questions in bold and the key scriptures.

00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:35.150
Begin each study by reading and discussing the first part together.

00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:40.150
Next, consider together the dig deeper section.

00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:50.150
Begin by reading the introductory statement, which explains what follows and take note of the subheadings that outline the main points.

00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:53.150
Read the scriptures.

00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:56.150
Watch the provided videos together.

00:50:56.150 --> 00:51:02.150
And then discuss how the scriptures and videos answer the related questions.

00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:06.150
Discuss the artwork with the student.

00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:10.150
Then follow with the questions found in the some people say section.

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:18.039
Then read the summary and discuss the review questions.

00:51:18.039 --> 00:51:23.039
Your student can enter the date the lesson was completed.

00:51:23.039 --> 00:51:27.039
Each lesson provides a goal for the student.

00:51:27.039 --> 00:51:34.039
And the explore section offers additional content that may be useful depending on your student's needs and interests.

00:51:34.039 --> 00:51:40.039
Yes, this tool is very different. Why was it designed this way?

00:51:40.039 --> 00:51:46.039
It's a lot like the teaching used in artheocratic schools. It is very interactive.

00:51:46.039 --> 00:51:54.039
On one hand, the lessons are written in such a way to really make the student think about what he is learning.

00:51:54.039 --> 00:51:59.039
This tool has the ability to involve the Bible student.

00:51:59.039 --> 00:52:04.039
It shows them with video and then they have references they can look at.

00:52:04.039 --> 00:52:12.039
But the way that it's designed involves them. And it really is going to give them a good foundation.

00:52:12.039 --> 00:52:23.039
On the other hand, the teacher can use the viewpoint questions to draw out how the student really feels about what he's learning from God's word.

00:52:23.039 --> 00:52:35.039
This is the most thoroughly field-tested publication that we have ever produced from writing the text to simplifying the text, polishing it, getting it ready.

00:52:35.039 --> 00:52:43.039
It has been produced so that it can be translated into many languages so as to help people everywhere.

00:52:43.039 --> 00:52:49.039
Yes, this tool is very different. But is it effective?

00:52:49.039 --> 00:52:56.039
Hundreds of publishers in almost 100 lands tested the lessons. What do they say about it?

00:52:56.039 --> 00:53:07.039
I love the new layout. It's current and it's intuitive. And the way the Bible truths are presented, it's very logical and easy to understand.

00:53:07.039 --> 00:53:10.039
I think it's going to be a game changer.

00:53:10.039 --> 00:53:17.039
The dig deeper section is amazing. It ensures that the teaching comes directly from the Bible.

00:53:17.039 --> 00:53:28.039
Because this part of the study becomes a conversation, the students answer right from their hearts, which allows me to learn a lot more about how they think and feel.

00:53:28.039 --> 00:53:33.039
The new method really helps us to convince the mind and reach the heart.

00:53:33.039 --> 00:53:40.039
Most of all, it helps both the teacher and the student to focus on the scriptures rather than on the study.

00:53:40.039 --> 00:53:50.039
I've never heard anybody say the paragraph says, because when they did answer the question, they were expressing what they really believed.

00:53:50.039 --> 00:53:57.039
The lessons are both logical and concise. The method is highly interactive.

00:53:57.039 --> 00:54:06.039
The students not only respond in their own words, but are also able to come to the correct conclusions all by themselves.

00:54:06.039 --> 00:54:13.039
It helps me as the teacher to talk less, and it helps the student to express himself and to think.

00:54:13.039 --> 00:54:21.039
And the videos elicited comment sometimes that even a personal nature that probably never were to come out, had it not been for the videos.

00:54:21.039 --> 00:54:31.039
The aim is to get an Ocehova, to love Jehova, to learn what his will is for us and to do that will, and also to draw close to his organization.

00:54:32.039 --> 00:54:39.039
I've been in full-time service for over 50 years. I conduct several Bible studies.

00:54:39.039 --> 00:54:46.039
These lessons cannot be compared with others. They're more effective and just what we need for our times.

00:54:49.039 --> 00:54:54.039
It equips them to explain to others what they have learned.

00:54:54.039 --> 00:55:04.039
And as a teacher, that fills me with so much joy that I am motivated to be zealous and find more new Bible studies.

00:55:04.039 --> 00:55:08.039
We are so excited about this new approach to teaching Bible truths.

00:55:08.039 --> 00:55:13.039
The main point stand out, the application is clear and it's easy to remember.

00:55:13.039 --> 00:55:19.039
And everybody can benefit from it, from those with little or no education to those who are highly educated.

00:55:19.039 --> 00:55:22.039
Our students are going to love this new publication.

00:55:22.039 --> 00:55:30.039
And we will too, is this will make us better teachers of God's word so as to make more disciples before the end comes.

00:55:30.039 --> 00:55:35.039
And how do members of the governing body feel about this innovative approach?

00:55:35.039 --> 00:55:47.039
This book has the potential to draw many honest-hearted ones into Jehova's organization, to serve alongside us in pure worship and dedicate their lives to Jehova.

00:55:47.039 --> 00:55:53.039
Compared to all the Bible study tools we've used in the past, this is gold.

00:55:53.039 --> 00:56:01.039
And that's what it's all about. Helping that student build a close relationship with Jehova and unquestionably.

00:56:01.039 --> 00:56:10.039
This new publication, this marvelous gift from Jehova, will help us accomplish this worthy goal.

00:56:10.039 --> 00:56:17.039
We recognize humbly that whatever tool we use, only Jehova can make it grow.

00:56:17.039 --> 00:56:27.039
So we're praying that Jehova will grant success to this new tool to build and make disciples of Christ.

00:56:27.039 --> 00:56:35.039
We are not just preachers. We are teachers. We are disciple-makers.

00:56:35.039 --> 00:56:51.019
This new book gives us what we need to help others love Jehova, follow Christ, get baptized, and enjoy life forever.

00:56:51.019 --> 00:56:58.019
What a fantastic new publication. I'm sure all of us are looking forward to using it.

00:56:58.019 --> 00:57:12.019
But you may be thinking, how big is it? How many pages are there? Well, there are 256 pages. And there are 60 lessons.

00:57:12.019 --> 00:57:21.019
Well, you may be thinking, will that be overwhelming to many people when we show them this new publication?

00:57:22.019 --> 00:57:30.019
Many of our Bible studies that we start do lesson one, two, and then by three, perhaps they stop studying.

00:57:30.019 --> 00:57:40.019
So if we're using a large publication, could it be that it would be a waste of a publication if someone isn't going to continue to study?

00:57:40.019 --> 00:57:47.019
Wouldn't it be great if we also had something else that would introduce this new study system?

00:57:47.019 --> 00:57:59.019
And that's exactly what we're happy to announce. The release of a new brochure entitled, Enjoy Life Forever, Introductory Bible Lessons.

00:57:59.019 --> 00:58:08.019
Now this new brochure contains within it the first three lessons of the new publication.

00:58:08.019 --> 00:58:16.019
When you look at the back of this brochure, you'll notice that it's designed similarly to the design of our tracks.

00:58:16.019 --> 00:58:26.019
It has a question, is it possible to enjoy Life Forever? Would you say yes, no, maybe?

00:58:26.019 --> 00:58:35.019
The explanation that's given below, along with the scriptures, help us then to direct the attention to the first lesson in the brochure.

00:58:35.019 --> 00:58:40.019
And this first lesson is entitled, How Can The Bible Help You?

00:58:40.019 --> 00:58:49.019
The second lesson is The Bible Gives Hope, and the third lesson, Can You Trust The Bible?

00:58:49.019 --> 00:58:54.019
What a wonderful way to introduce this new publication.

00:58:54.019 --> 00:59:02.019
So once we've gone through the brochure, finish the three lessons. If someone shows that they really want to continue in a Bible study,

00:59:02.019 --> 00:59:08.019
then we introduce them to the larger publication and start at lesson number four.

00:59:08.019 --> 00:59:20.019
Well, that's so exciting, isn't it? It will be very easy to use this and also to use the electronic version, which has been developed the same time as the printed version.

00:59:20.019 --> 00:59:31.019
With the electronic version in JW Library, you'll be able to just tap the link and it will take you to the videos or to the verses or to the reference material.

00:59:31.019 --> 00:59:34.019
Isn't that exciting?

00:59:34.019 --> 00:59:43.019
I'm sure all of us are looking forward to being able to use this new brochure and the new publication to start Bible studies.

00:59:43.019 --> 00:59:46.019
But there's still one question left.

00:59:46.019 --> 00:59:56.019
Wouldn't it be great if we can use these publications to help other persons to become disciples, yes, and to enjoy life forever?

00:59:56.019 --> 01:00:04.480
Yes, that will be great, Brother Jackson. Thank you.

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:10.480
It is exciting to have such an innovative new tool to conduct Bible studies.

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:16.480
And that first exposure to the introductory study brochure was very helpful.

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:23.480
But you might be thinking, the video was presented so fast, it's a blur in my mind.

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:30.480
I am not sure if I understand all of the features or how the study has to progress.

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:32.480
Well, take heart.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:39.480
For one thing, you can watch that video over and over again if you like.

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:49.480
But also, please know that more information will be coming to help you assimilate these new teaching techniques in the future.

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:53.980
What is next on our program?

01:00:54.980 --> 01:01:04.980
For the past few years, our annual meeting program has presented a longer than usual animated edition of Become Jehovah's Friend.

01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:07.980
It is always special.

01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:10.980
This year is no exception.

01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:15.980
We are pleased to present to you young ones and all of you who are still young at heart.

01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:23.980
The new epic edition entitled Jehovah forgives. Please enjoy the presentation.

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:41.300
It was Jesus last night with his apostles.

01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:44.300
You were the ones who have stuck with me in my trials.

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:48.610
Soon, Jesus would be arrested.

01:01:48.610 --> 01:01:52.610
It was going to be very hard for them.

01:01:52.610 --> 01:01:56.610
All of you will be stumbled in connection with me on this night.

01:01:57.610 --> 01:02:03.610
For it is written, I will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered about.

01:02:03.610 --> 01:02:07.610
They were going to run away and abandon Jesus.

01:02:07.610 --> 01:02:09.610
But Peter said,

01:02:09.610 --> 01:02:15.610
Although all the others are stumbled in connection with you, I will never be stumbled.

01:02:15.610 --> 01:02:17.610
Very good Caleb.

01:02:17.610 --> 01:02:24.239
Peter thought he was strong and would never make Jehovah sad.

01:02:24.239 --> 01:02:32.239
I tell you, Peter, a rooster will not crow today until you have denied knowing me three times.

01:02:32.239 --> 01:02:34.239
Cuckoo!

01:02:34.239 --> 01:02:36.239
No, it's cuckoo-do-do-do!

01:02:36.239 --> 01:02:38.239
No, that's not a rooster.

01:02:38.239 --> 01:02:43.239
If he kids, it's not important color rooster sounds.

01:02:43.239 --> 01:02:45.239
I'll never make Jehovah sad.

01:02:45.239 --> 01:02:47.239
Me neither.

01:02:47.239 --> 01:02:49.239
We know you never want to.

01:02:49.239 --> 01:02:52.239
But Jesus knew Peter would be afraid.

01:02:52.239 --> 01:02:54.239
And when you are afraid?

01:02:54.239 --> 01:02:57.650
Oh no, you're late!

01:02:57.650 --> 01:03:01.469
Hurry, grab your bags.

01:03:01.469 --> 01:03:05.289
Be careful.

01:03:05.289 --> 01:03:06.289
Love you kids.

01:03:06.289 --> 01:03:08.289
See you later.

01:03:08.289 --> 01:03:51.530
Be good.

01:03:51.530 --> 01:04:11.659
Anybody?

01:04:11.659 --> 01:04:14.659
What if Jehovah doesn't want to be my friend anymore?

01:04:14.659 --> 01:04:22.340
Jehovah wants to be your friend.

01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:29.150
But if he did something bad, he wants you to tell.

01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:35.150
Okay, so today at school, I was outside on the playground.

01:04:35.150 --> 01:05:21.110
It was just...

01:05:21.110 --> 01:05:24.900
Wait!

01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:26.900
I thought he can't have it!

01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:28.900
Yeah, which is it?

01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:43.250
Come on, what did you say?

01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:46.250
But you came to my house together to talk about the Bible.

01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:49.250
Don't you remember?

01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:53.250
Yeah, maybe that wasn't me.

01:05:53.250 --> 01:06:05.110
That was you, but you're scared.

01:06:05.110 --> 01:06:26.699
That was a rough day.

01:06:26.699 --> 01:06:34.980
Do you remember when Peter said he would never stumble?

01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:37.980
Later that night, Jesus was arrested.

01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:55.579
Peter loved him and wanted to help.

01:06:55.579 --> 01:07:21.619
In the right thing, isn't always easy.

01:07:21.619 --> 01:07:24.619
You two were with Jesus the Galilean.

01:07:24.619 --> 01:07:29.280
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:38.900
Wait!

01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:44.510
This is one of them.

01:07:44.510 --> 01:08:02.539
I do not know the man.

01:08:02.539 --> 01:08:04.539
Hey, you follow Jesus.

01:08:04.539 --> 01:08:06.539
I saw you in the garden with him.

01:08:06.539 --> 01:08:09.400
Did I not?

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:55.310
I swear, I do not know the man!

01:08:55.310 --> 01:08:57.310
You're the right thing to do.

01:08:57.310 --> 01:09:07.930
But he was afraid and did the wrong thing.

01:09:07.930 --> 01:09:08.930
Just like a school?

01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:14.640
Yes.

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:20.239
Peter didn't want to make that mistake ever again.

01:09:20.239 --> 01:09:24.239
But he wondered if Jesus and Jehovah would still be his friends.

01:09:24.239 --> 01:09:47.180
After Jesus was resurrected, he talked to Peter.

01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:50.180
Simon, son of John, do you love me?

01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:53.180
Yes.

01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:57.460
Lord, you know I have affection for you.

01:09:57.460 --> 01:09:59.460
Jesus forgave him.

01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:02.460
And so did Jehovah.

01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:05.460
But Peter had to talk to Jesus.

01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:10.460
If you upset Jehovah, what do you think you have to do?

01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:12.460
Talk to Jehovah.

01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:14.460
That's right.

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:18.460
You need to pray to ask for forgiveness.

01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:23.460
And Jesus showed Peter that he was forgiven by giving him more work to do.

01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:26.460
Shepherd my little sheep.

01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:38.270
So why didn't Peter give up when he made a mistake?

01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:41.270
Because Jehovah forgives.

01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:43.270
Hey, guys.

01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:54.289
Oh, wait.

01:10:54.289 --> 01:10:55.289
Explain birthdays.

01:10:55.289 --> 01:10:57.289
Can you help me?

01:10:57.289 --> 01:11:01.109
Of course.

01:11:01.109 --> 01:11:07.109
That was a masterful application of a Bible example about Jehovah's forgiveness.

01:11:08.109 --> 01:11:13.109
Caleb got the point and so did all of us.

01:11:13.109 --> 01:11:22.109
Did you notice at the very end, Caleb asked his father to help him explain our stand on birthdays?

01:11:22.109 --> 01:11:30.109
Please look forward to an upcoming video on demand segment where his father does just that.

01:11:30.109 --> 01:11:35.109
And by the way, we are making a poster available online.

01:11:35.109 --> 01:11:51.649
And you'll be happy to know that posters will be made available for the other epic animation videos of the Become Jehovah's Friend series.

01:11:51.649 --> 01:11:59.569
The pandemic in 2020 changed the way we carried out true worship.

01:11:59.569 --> 01:12:03.569
The memorial last year was experienced in private homes.

01:12:03.569 --> 01:12:05.569
Our preaching methods were changed.

01:12:05.569 --> 01:12:11.569
And our regional conventions were transformed into pre-recorded sessions.

01:12:11.569 --> 01:12:16.569
But we were all cared for spiritually.

01:12:16.569 --> 01:12:21.569
What was involved in making this all happen so quickly and effectively?

01:12:21.569 --> 01:12:31.840
Please watch our next video.

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:35.840
2020 was a year of unprecedented change.

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:40.840
The coronavirus pandemic has taken a grim toll around the world.

01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:49.970
In some parts of the world, the coronavirus is beginning to spread more quickly.

01:12:49.970 --> 01:12:55.970
This global pandemic has thrown the world into a state of uncertainty.

01:12:55.970 --> 01:13:07.260
On a global scale, it was unlike anything Jehovah's people had yet experienced in the 21st century.

01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:17.260
Every day life from many of us has been disrupted in ways we might never have imagined.

01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:23.260
We've made dramatic adjustments to our activities all over the world.

01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:28.260
Learn how to use new apps like Skype and Zoom. What's that?

01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:35.260
It changed how we attended meetings, engaged in the ministry, and visited with friends.

01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:42.260
For some of us, this may have been the very first time we ever held a memorial in our home.

01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:49.260
And although attending in smaller groups may have been even closer to how the memorial was observed in earlier times,

01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:59.899
for most modern-day servants of Jehovah, this was likely a unique experience.

01:13:59.899 --> 01:14:08.899
Then, during the summer, we enjoyed a full convention program with talks delivered directly from governing body members and their helpers.

01:14:08.899 --> 01:14:19.800
And in most cases, again, streamed right into our homes.

01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:24.800
Yes, despite the various challenges and difficulties experienced in 2020,

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:31.800
Jehovah's organization continued undaunted, providing the right food at the right time.

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:37.800
But why was this convention unlike any other in our organization's history?

01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:42.800
What were the challenges? And most important, what have been the benefits?

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:57.380
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization made the assessment that COVID-19 could be characterized as a pandemic.

01:14:57.380 --> 01:15:02.380
At that point, we had no idea as to what governments were going to do worldwide.

01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:10.380
Would they allow our brothers to meet in kingdom halls? Would they allow our brothers to meet in large venues?

01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:12.380
We had no idea whatsoever.

01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:20.380
The governing body approved a letter to all branches, canceling all live conventions worldwide.

01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:33.380
And the idea was for us to pre-record a program that could be used in any location around the world so that they would at least have the program of the regional convention.

01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:39.380
We wanted to ensure that this spiritual food got out there to all of our dear brothers and sisters.

01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:49.380
More important, we wanted to make certain that this program went forward because it honors Jehovah, he's the source of the joy that we have.

01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:53.380
So very quickly, speakers were each assigned two convention ports.

01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:59.380
They had to prepare them, and it was scheduled to have all of these talks recorded during the last two weeks of April.

01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:08.380
Giving a talk at an open arena or at a large event, you have the opportunity of getting feedback from the audience.

01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:21.380
If you say something that impresses the audience or makes them happy, seeing the smiling faces there, somehow that really stirs up our presentation and helps us to make it more lively and meaningful.

01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:35.380
But being in the basement of the office building, looking at a camera with nobody else in the room, knowing that it's just a couple of persons recording it in another room,

01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:39.380
certainly is a very different way to present a talk.

01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:54.380
And Jehovah has allowed us to endure this time of pandemic, but he also had to know, and we're convinced he knew that we could still make this always rejoice program happen

01:16:54.380 --> 01:17:00.380
because we would use the tools available to us, and he would help us, and that's exactly what we did.

01:17:05.949 --> 01:17:11.949
Next, let's take a closer look at some additional challenges faced once the talks were recorded.

01:17:11.949 --> 01:17:16.949
We had the opportunity to hear from some of the departments involved.

01:17:16.949 --> 01:17:22.949
Brothers, how did the team adapt to the challenges?

01:17:22.949 --> 01:17:30.949
Well, the reaction initially was, we were very excited. We love to try new things, and this was a huge opportunity to do just that.

01:17:30.949 --> 01:17:34.949
But then as we had more meetings about it, we found out what all was going to be involved.

01:17:34.949 --> 01:17:40.949
We suddenly got very nervous because we found out about all the translation and how soon everything had to be finished.

01:17:40.949 --> 01:17:43.949
What impact did that have?

01:17:43.949 --> 01:17:48.949
Audio video services had never produced an online program of this size before.

01:17:48.949 --> 01:17:54.949
You're talking an 18-hour online regional convention that had to be produced in a very short time.

01:17:54.949 --> 01:18:02.949
In most years, we just translate the outlines, which are relatively easy, and then we translate all the convention videos and dramas.

01:18:02.949 --> 01:18:15.949
But this year, the translators not only had to do that work of translating the videos, but they had to translate the scripts for each talk and then arrange for recording all of those talks.

01:18:15.949 --> 01:18:18.949
It was a tremendous amount of work.

01:18:18.949 --> 01:18:26.949
Some of us were saying, can we postpone it? Can we ask for to write back and say, brothers, please, can we do it later?

01:18:26.949 --> 01:18:30.949
Because we just thought it is impossible to do.

01:18:30.949 --> 01:18:35.949
The government in India had announced a complete lockdown.

01:18:35.949 --> 01:18:45.949
So overnight, where without our offices, our computer equipment, our recording studios, the level of connectivity we would enjoy,

01:18:45.949 --> 01:18:57.949
we felt like a carpenter was also produced furniture, but has no access to his toolbox or his workshop.

01:18:57.949 --> 01:19:00.949
That is a lot to contend with.

01:19:00.949 --> 01:19:07.949
What are some unique solutions that the teams came up with to meet those various challenges?

01:19:07.949 --> 01:19:21.550
Well, there were amazing solutions. One of the things that impressed me was the recording studios that were made.

01:19:21.550 --> 01:19:31.550
Normally, the translators go into the RTO or the branch to do the recording, but now they had to make hundreds of makeshift studios in their homes.

01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:37.550
I would translate to the accomplished work outside the branch with the power coming in and out.

01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:44.550
Well, the brothers would wait and as soon as the power comes, they would start working.

01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:47.550
No matter what time it was, what time was it in the day.

01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:52.550
Our brothers were well-soddedicated that they accomplished the work.

01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:53.550
Very touching.

01:19:53.550 --> 01:19:59.550
But our brothers who do sign language recordings have to record in front of a camera.

01:19:59.550 --> 01:20:13.550
But they also needed to have ideally behind them a background that was bright green or bright blue so that their signing could be superimposed onto another video.

01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:16.550
And so some brothers were able to get a cloth.

01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:22.550
Many of our brothers painted a wall in their house, this bright chartreuse color.

01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:24.550
Admirable ingenuity, thank you.

01:20:24.550 --> 01:20:40.550
One of the most interesting solutions was that many of the translators around the world in different branches would go into their car late at night when all the noise had subsided in the neighborhood and they would do the recording inside the car.

01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:45.550
Thank you and everyone working with you for being so willing to adapt.

01:20:45.550 --> 01:20:50.550
In your opinion, what made all of this possible?

01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:57.550
Despite a global pandemic, despite a lockdown, none of those things matter to Jehovah's organization.

01:20:57.550 --> 01:21:06.550
What has shut down various other things throughout the world proved to be no obstacle for Jehovah in his earthly organization.

01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:13.550
And what a beautiful thing it is to see this program be something that's enjoyed by everyone worldwide.

01:21:13.550 --> 01:21:19.550
Here, despite the conditions going on in the world around us, Jehovah's people are moving forward.

01:21:19.550 --> 01:21:29.550
And you really see the fulfillment of Malachi 318 where it says that you will see a distinction between those serving Jehovah and those who don't.

01:21:29.550 --> 01:21:39.550
Everyone who had a part in this, the thousands of brothers and sisters around the world, who had a part in bringing these convention programs for brothers and sisters.

01:21:39.550 --> 01:21:42.550
They're just normal people, like you and I.

01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:48.550
But Jehovah uses normal people to accomplish incredible things.

01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:55.550
This convention has been a landmark convention because of the content and the beautiful theme.

01:21:55.550 --> 01:22:06.550
But we'll also remember it for the way Jehovah helped us to produce it in so many languages for brothers and sisters in the country and around the world.

01:22:06.550 --> 01:22:14.550
Well, in translation, we like verbs. And in Jehovah's name, there's a verb. It causes to become.

01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:26.550
This 2020 convention was approved that Jehovah causes whatever he wants to become to accomplish his purpose.

01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:33.550
Because if there's a convention that Jehovah used to give glory to his name, this is it.

01:22:33.550 --> 01:22:38.550
What? Beautiful conviction. Thank you, brothers.

01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:45.550
Yes, Jehovah's Spirit helped ensure that the work was accomplished in spite of many challenges.

01:22:45.550 --> 01:22:49.550
But what were some of the blessings experienced once the work was done?

01:22:49.550 --> 01:23:00.539
Because the convention is being presented by means of video, it's possible to pause at any time when necessary.

01:23:00.539 --> 01:23:07.539
Just to go back a little bit to watch something that maybe we didn't quite get. And maybe even because sometimes our minds drift.

01:23:07.539 --> 01:23:13.539
It's good because we can go back and rewatch it. And in this way, we get even more benefit from the program.

01:23:13.539 --> 01:23:23.340
I cannot imagine a convention more international than this one.

01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:29.340
We saw how the brothers were able to make a difficult situation turn out well. That is, we're together.

01:23:29.340 --> 01:23:35.340
Even if we're physically apart from each other, we are united at this convention.

01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:52.420
Volunteers were sent by the elders to travel and obtain the videos due to lack of internet in our village.

01:23:52.420 --> 01:23:58.380
We traveled about 46 kilometers on foot.

01:23:58.380 --> 01:24:09.800
Sometimes we would leave early in the morning or late in the evening, even traveling at night in order to obtain the videos.

01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:14.800
But with Jehovah's blessing, we overcame all of these challenges.

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:30.899
I lost my dearest wife about two months before the convention started. It was cancer.

01:24:30.899 --> 01:24:35.899
We have been married for 14 years and she was only 47.

01:24:35.899 --> 01:24:44.779
She was my greatest partner in Jehovah's service. So this left me with a gaping hole.

01:24:44.779 --> 01:24:59.229
The theme of the convention, to always rejoice, came just at the right time for me.

01:24:59.229 --> 01:25:03.229
I know it was Jehovah's wonderful gift to me.

01:25:03.229 --> 01:25:11.229
Through the convention, I could see that Jehovah had sent all the members of the governing body and its helpers to me personally.

01:25:11.229 --> 01:25:14.229
I can't think of a better gift.

01:25:14.229 --> 01:25:27.909
I really enjoyed the audio description because I am someone who is legally blind.

01:25:27.909 --> 01:25:31.909
And the audio description just opened up a whole new world for me.

01:25:31.909 --> 01:25:35.909
Ben walks out of the room as his coworkers shape their heads.

01:25:35.909 --> 01:25:44.020
So it was really amazing to have the videos being described.

01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:51.020
And for me, I felt like I can now see what was happening.

01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:58.020
A lot of what the audio description described are things that I normally would have been curious about.

01:25:58.020 --> 01:26:02.020
And I would have been asking somebody to help me understand.

01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:12.090
I had tears in my eyes knowing that the governing body loves us this much.

01:26:12.090 --> 01:26:14.090
I speak Korean.

01:26:14.090 --> 01:26:17.090
I speak Japanese.

01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:24.090
We made a Japanese section and a Korean section, like what we would have at international conventions.

01:26:24.090 --> 01:26:31.090
In order to watch the convention simultaneously, we would count 1, 2, 3 and start playing our videos at the same time.

01:26:31.090 --> 01:26:34.090
This way we were able to watch and sing together.

01:26:34.090 --> 01:26:38.090
It really felt like an international convention.

01:26:38.090 --> 01:26:41.090
Something that I thought I would miss a lot were the Kingdom melodies.

01:26:41.090 --> 01:26:44.090
So then I wondered, how is this going to work at home?

01:26:44.090 --> 01:26:47.090
There won't be a crowd, everyone singing together.

01:26:47.090 --> 01:26:49.090
How is it going to be?

01:26:49.090 --> 01:26:51.090
I thought I would really miss it.

01:26:51.090 --> 01:26:54.090
But then my family and I agreed to sing the Kingdom melodies loudly.

01:26:54.090 --> 01:26:59.090
And it worked. I have never seen my family sing so loudly.

01:26:59.090 --> 01:27:10.300
We have three children.

01:27:10.300 --> 01:27:13.300
And all five of us here at home, we all got COVID-19.

01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:18.300
And all during the time that the convention was being shown, we were all exhibiting symptoms.

01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:20.300
It was a really hard time.

01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:24.300
Our family was so encouraged by the convention program this year.

01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:37.300
My wife, Marisa, even said that to her, it was as if the talks the brothers gave were like hearing advice from a close friend who was sitting right next to you, like they were right in the same room with us.

01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:49.039
The convention is very positive. It's contagious. It has really touched our hearts.

01:27:49.039 --> 01:27:53.039
I truly feel the convention has touched my heart deeply.

01:27:53.039 --> 01:28:08.039
Both my mom and my dad, who are right now struggling with very serious illnesses, were able to join myself, my brother, and my sister-in-law, and we were together as a family in our living room.

01:28:08.039 --> 01:28:16.039
We got to sing together and watch the assembly together, which otherwise just would not have been possible.

01:28:16.039 --> 01:28:32.039
Despite the struggles, despite the limitations that we may be facing, none of that has stopped Jehovah from reaching out and even being in our own living rooms during this convention.

01:28:32.039 --> 01:28:41.579
Jehovah transforms something that Satan is using right now to take away our joy to something that gives us joy.

01:28:41.579 --> 01:28:50.579
Think about it. We're watching the same spiritual program at the same time with the same speakers, brothers from the governing body.

01:28:50.579 --> 01:28:53.579
We never imagine that we would have this opportunity.

01:28:53.579 --> 01:29:08.180
Okay. Are we all set? Ready whenever you are if you want to go ahead?

01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:22.380
We are delighted that you could join us for this opening session of the Always Rejoice Convention of Jehovah's Witnesses.

01:29:22.380 --> 01:29:29.380
And when everything around you is chaotic, the one thing you have is your relationship with Jehovah.

01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:39.960
I will walk in your truth, unifying my heart to fear your name.

01:29:39.960 --> 01:30:11.890
But we discover something we have lost.

01:30:13.890 --> 01:30:28.109
Joy, no matter what terror, no matter what trial may come upon us now or in the future,

01:30:28.109 --> 01:30:35.109
we will be able to continue to rejoice in Jehovah's Acts of Salvation.

01:30:35.109 --> 01:30:51.699
While 2020 seemed to be anything but a time for rejoicing, this year's convention proved that no matter what the circumstance we are in,

01:30:51.699 --> 01:30:56.699
Jehovah will continue to feed us and we will continue to worship Him.

01:30:56.699 --> 01:31:05.340
Thanks to Jehovah, we experienced the truthfulness of Philippians 4-4.

01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:12.340
But no matter the trial or difficulty, we will always rejoice in the Lord.

01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:31.500
Despite changing circumstances, what can we say?

01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:37.500
Jehovah lived up to the meaning of his name. He causes to become.

01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:43.500
Things happened in quick succession with the support of his will and Holy Spirit.

01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:46.500
Now, back to our studio.

01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:51.260
How encouraging.

01:31:51.260 --> 01:32:01.260
The second part of the program will be released on January 18th in the video on Demand Section of JW Broadcasting.

01:32:02.260 --> 01:32:11.579
Then, I'll be back in the studio next month to introduce the last part of the program.

01:32:11.579 --> 01:32:21.579
To conclude our January monthly program, we'll get to know brothers in the Central African Republic during our video postcard.

01:32:21.579 --> 01:32:31.579
As its name suggests, the Central African Republic is near the exact center of the African continent, landlocked.

01:32:31.579 --> 01:32:37.579
It shares its border with six neighboring countries and is comparable in size to France.

01:32:37.579 --> 01:32:45.579
While it has two official languages, French and Sango, there are also several other tribal languages spoken.

01:32:45.579 --> 01:32:59.579
The Central African Republic is rich in natural resources, such as diamonds, gold and timber, not to mention beautiful wildlife, such as analogue, elephants,

01:32:59.579 --> 01:33:05.579
baboons, leopards and many others that roam freely.

01:33:05.579 --> 01:33:16.579
Sadly, this country has endured many years of armed conflicts and civil unrest, which has resulted in severe hardship for the people living there.

01:33:16.579 --> 01:33:23.579
Despite these hardships, our brothers are working tirelessly to provide spiritual relief.

01:33:23.579 --> 01:33:30.579
For example, in the Bozoom congregation, there are 70 publishers and several pioneers.

01:33:30.579 --> 01:33:35.579
Together, they're conducting about 150 Bible studies.

01:33:35.579 --> 01:33:44.579
Besides caring for their local territory, the branch office has assigned the congregation the care of three isolated groups.

01:33:44.579 --> 01:33:50.579
These groups are up to 125 kilometers or 78 miles away from Bozoom.

01:33:50.579 --> 01:34:01.579
Reaching these groups is challenging for our brothers since there is no public transportation, and only 3% of the roads in the country are paved.

01:34:01.579 --> 01:34:15.579
Nevertheless, the Bozoom congregation regularly sends elders to give public talks and conduct the Watchtower study in Boko Ranga, since there are no appointed brothers in that group of 10 publishers.

01:34:15.579 --> 01:34:22.579
Although there is civil unrest in Boko Ranga, the group is conducting some 30 Bible studies.

01:34:22.579 --> 01:34:36.579
The Boko Ranga brothers and sisters in the Bozoom congregation send their greetings to all of you fellow witnesses worldwide, and we send our greetings back to all of our brothers in the Central African Republic.

01:34:36.579 --> 01:34:43.579
From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is J.W. Broadcasting.
