00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:19.829
Life is kind of lonely right now, all of my friends got married and seems so happy.

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:40.070
What if I never find someone, Taylor invites me for a gathering?

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.020
That's nice.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.020
Actually, I don't feel comfortable at gatherings.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.579
All those people, maybe another time.

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.939
I just love my job.

00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:07.609
Mark has given me lots of attention lately.

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:10.609
He really appreciates me.

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:14.609
And actually, he's kind of cute.

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:19.430
But he's not a brother.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.680
I really want to be obedient to Jehovah.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.329
But it's hard.

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:34.780
Mary only in the Lord.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.780
That sounds nice.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.780
I just don't know any brother I really connect with.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.659
Taylor met her husband on the internet.

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.659
They seem to be very happy.

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.480
So what's the harm in finding a brother that way?

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.480
Would it really be bad to have a quick look at one of those JW dating sites?

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:11.659
It's Julia.

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:14.659
How thoughtful of her to invite me for family worship.

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.979
Should I join them?

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:21.509
Oh well, why not?

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:34.330
Julia used to be in the same position as I'm in.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.330
She understands me.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:44.479
I love the story of Jeff Thin's daughter.

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:53.300
Because her father made a promise to Jehovah.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.300
She served at Jehovah's Tabernacle for the rest of her life.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:06.479
She was single too.

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:09.479
And sad for a little while.

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:13.479
But she learned to be content and found joy in her service to Jehovah.

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:18.340
Every year her friends visited her.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.340
And were a real encouragement.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.870
And so am I.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.870
That family study really had an impact on me.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.870
If Jeff Thin's daughter could do that, so can I.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.870
Jehovah promises that.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.870
Jehovah will not hold back anything good from those walking in integrity.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.340
I cannot believe it even crossed my mind to date a non-witness.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.340
Or even look at those JW dating sites and put my integrity at stake.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.340
Imagine what I could have gotten myself into.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.990
I'm so happy Julia invited me.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:08.849
Jehovah will definitely be there for me to turn my singleness into a success.

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.849
It's been a while now since I've started pioneering.

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:18.800
That decision strengthened my relationship with Jehovah.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.269
I feel much closer to the congregation.

00:04:23.269 --> 00:04:28.269
I finally understand what Jesus meant at Matthew 19, verse 12.

00:04:28.269 --> 00:04:33.269
He said, let the one who can make room for it, make room for it.

00:04:33.269 --> 00:04:39.970
My singleness indeed allows me to serve Jehovah without distraction.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.970
I just love my life.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:54.060
An invitation to the school for Kingdom Evangelises.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:00.060
Yes, Jehovah really did not hold back anything good from me.
