00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.929
Where do we come from?

00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:08.429
Is one of life's most basic questions?

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.429
And how we answer that question could, to a large extent,

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.230
determine where we are going.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.230
Some people believe that life came about by evolution

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.429
and that no one deserves credit for it.

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:24.829
Others believe in creation,

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:28.530
but no little or nothing about the Creator.

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:30.829
Still, others may not give the question,

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:32.630
where do we come from?

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.130
Any thought at all.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.329
In this video series,

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.329
you will meet a variety of people

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.829
who at one time believed in the evolution of life

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.429
or had unclear ideas about how life came to be.

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:51.329
Most of them had scientific or cultural backgrounds

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.229
that formed the basis for their beliefs.

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:58.630
Jehovah's Witnesses agree with the Bible verse

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.729
at Romans 120,

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:04.230
which says that God's invisible qualities

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.430
are clearly seen from the world's creation onward

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.730
because they are perceived by the things made,

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.829
even his eternal power and Godship.

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:17.430
In each video,

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.129
you'll hear how someone came to agree

00:01:20.129 --> 00:01:22.829
with the existence of a Creator.

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:25.829
And you'll learn something about what they observed

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:28.829
that changed their thinking.

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.629
The video series is entitled

00:01:31.629 --> 00:01:35.129
View Points on the Origin of Life.
