00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.519
An introduction to the Book of Philippians.

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:09.929
The Apostle Paul wrote this inspired letter from Rome,

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.929
where he was under house arrest.

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:18.039
He wrote the letter about 60 or 61 CE.

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:24.280
Some years earlier, during his second missionary tour,

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.280
Paul had received a vision while he was in Troas.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.280
A Macedonian man entreated him,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.280
step over into Macedonia and help us.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.280
So in about 50 CE,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.280
Paul and his companions began to preach the good news

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.329
in the Macedonian city of Philippi.

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.329
Paul established a congregation there,

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.329
but not without opposition.

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:56.829
He and Silas were beaten with rods and thrown into prison,

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.420
where their feet were fastened in stocks.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.420
Paul returned to Philippi during his third missionary tour.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.420
His letter to the congregation

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.420
reveals the special bond of love

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.420
that he and the Philippian brothers had for each other.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.819
The letter to the Philippians has four chapters.

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:24.819
In chapter 1, Paul writes that his current imprisonment in Rome

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:28.819
has led to the advancement of the good news.

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:31.819
The Apostle's courage in the face of opposition

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:34.819
has strengthened the brothers to keep speaking

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:37.819
the word of God fearlessly.

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:41.819
In chapter 2, Paul encourages the Philippians

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:48.159
to keep imitating the mental attitude of Christ.

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.159
The Philippians are then commended

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.140
for shining as illuminators in the world.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.140
Did you know?

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.140
Sometime earlier, the Philippians had sent

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.140
a paparaditis to Rome with the gift for Paul.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.140
Paul later sent a paparaditis back to Philippi

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.139
entrusting him with his inspired letter to the congregation.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.990
In chapter 3, Paul warns against those

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.990
who have confidence in the flesh, evidently

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.990
because of their Jewish background.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.990
Paul considers any advantages that he once enjoyed as a Pharisee

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.990
to be refused compared with the privilege of knowing Christ

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.990
and being in union with him.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.530
In chapter 4, the Philippians are reminded

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.530
not to be anxious over anything,

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.530
but to find the peace of God through prayer,

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.530
supplication, and thanksgiving.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.530
Paul also thanks the congregation

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.530
for its generosity in providing for his material needs.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.530
As you read the letter to the Philippians,

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.530
note how our beings steadfast under trial

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.530
can encourage others to stand firm.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.530
How God's word and spirit can help us

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.530
to keep imitating the mental attitude of Christ.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.530
And how true peace comes to those

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.530
who turn to God in heartfelt prayer

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.530
as they await his kingdom rule.
