00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.549
The theme of this month's program is, make wise decisions.

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:11.550
Now, discussion is based on Job 34 verse 11.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.550
Let's read that together.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.550
For he, Jehovah, will reward a man according to what he does

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.550
and bring upon him the consequences of his ways.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.989
As highlighted in the scripture, our actions are very important.

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:35.990
And our actions are usually the result of decisions we make.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.990
Some decisions are made after a lot of serious thought.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.990
Others though are made very quickly.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.990
But no matter how much thought goes into making a decision,

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.990
we need to recognize this basic fact.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.990
Wise decisions bring positive rewards.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:03.990
And wrong decisions can result in very negative consequences.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.989
Of course, all of us want to make wise decisions,

00:01:06.989 --> 00:01:10.989
but what are wise decisions?

00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:16.989
Wise decisions are those that please our Heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:20.989
Most of us have already made some very good decisions.

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:23.989
These include the big decisions in life such as

00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:27.989
dedicating ourselves to Jehovah and getting baptized

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:30.989
and deciding not to become involved in the religious

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:34.989
and political disputes of this world.

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:37.989
No doubt before we made those major decisions,

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:43.989
we spend a lot of time praying about them and seeking Jehovah's direction.

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:49.989
And we have seen his blessing in our lives because of these right decisions.

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:55.989
In this program though, we won't be discussing such major decisions.

00:01:55.989 --> 00:02:01.989
Rather, we'll focus on decisions that may be viewed by some as minor.

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:08.990
However, some of these can lead to very serious consequences.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.990
First we'll consider a Bible example of a person who served Jehovah

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.990
and yet made some wrong decisions along the way.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.990
We'll analyze what caused this faithful servant to make these wrong decisions.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.990
Then we'll consider what we need to do in order to make wise decisions.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:37.990
Finally, we'll consider what we need to do if we realize we've already made an unwise decision.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.990
So to start, let's discuss a faithful servant of Jehovah

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.990
who made some unwise decisions.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.990
The example we have in mind is that of King Jehosephat.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.990
What was Jehovah's view of King Jehosephat?

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:03.990
Let's see the answer at 2 Chronicles chapter 17 and verses 3 and 4.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:11.990
Jehovah continued with Jehosephat because he walked in the former ways of his forefather David

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.990
and did not search for the bails.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.990
But he searched for the God of his father and followed his commandment

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.689
and not the practices of Israel.

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:27.689
That sounds like a wonderful commendation, doesn't it?

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:31.689
Yes, Jehosephat was a faithful King.

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:35.689
He made the wise decision to worship Jehovah.

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:42.689
But even so, he still made some very unwise decisions.

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:52.060
Let's read about one of those unwise decisions at 2 Chronicles chapter 18 and verse 1.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.060
Jehosephat had riches and glory and abundance.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.060
But he made a marriage alliance with Ahab.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.060
Yes, he made his son marry Ahab's daughter, Atholah.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.060
Now that was a very unwise decision.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.060
Why?

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:19.060
Because Ahab had built a temple for bale and had even employed 850 false prophets.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.060
Ahab was also married to wicked Queen Jezebel.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.060
Who would want the child to marry into such a bad family?

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.060
What was Jehosephat thinking?

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.060
Why did he arrange for this marriage?

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:43.060
Perhaps he wanted to reunite the 12 tribes or he may have had some political and commercial motives

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.060
for wanting to have Ahab as an ally.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:54.060
Even though we don't know for sure the reason, we do know there were consequences.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:03.060
Because of this close relationship with Ahab, Jehosephat felt obligated to support Ahab in a war against the Sunians.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.060
However, this led to yet another unwise decision.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:17.060
As they were preparing for this battle, Jehosephat asked for direction from one of Jehovah's prophets.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:26.060
Ahab though expressed his hatred for the prophet and after hearing the prophet's message had him thrown into prison.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:32.060
At that point, it was decision time for Jehosephat.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.060
What did he decide to do?

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:42.060
Although he initially disagreed with Ahab, he eventually joined him in the battle.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.060
Jehosephat disregarded the warning from Jehovah.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:55.060
But then this led him to still another unwise decision, this time an incredibly foolish decision.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.060
What happened?

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:03.060
Jehovah's prophet had foretold that the Israelites would lose their shepherd or king in battle.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:11.060
So Ahab said that he would disguise himself and not enter the battle dressed as a king.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.060
He then said that Jehosephat should still dress like a king.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.060
Now just think about that for a moment.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.060
Ahab was basically saying,

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:28.060
you go out into the battle with a target on your back and all hide in disguise.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.060
Really?

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:36.060
Jehosephat's decision to agree to do that was not only unwise but also foolish.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.060
It nearly cost him his life.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.060
So why would he do that?

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:51.060
Inside on the scripture says that perhaps Jehosephat didn't want to go back on his original promise to accompany Ahab.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:57.060
So maybe he would have lost face if he backed out of the agreement at that point.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:08.060
Although Jehosephat did survive the battle, Jehovah sent another prophet to him to say what's recorded at 2 Chronicles 19 verse 2.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:15.060
Is it the wicked you should be helping and is it those who hate Jehovah you should love?

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:22.060
Because of this, the indignation of Jehovah is against you.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:29.060
Although Jehovah acknowledged the good things that Jehosephat had accomplished in other aspects of his life,

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:34.060
Jehosephat clearly made some very unwise decisions.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:38.060
What lessons do we learn from Jehosephat's wrong decisions?

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:49.060
Lesson 1. Just because we've done many good things in Jehosephat's service doesn't mean that we'll always make wise decisions.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:59.060
Lesson 2. Making friendships with those who hate Jehosephat can put us under pressure to make other unwise decisions.

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:05.060
Lesson 3. Even though we may seek Jehosephat's direction,

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:10.060
we must follow it if we want to make wise decisions.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:22.060
Lesson 4. If we realize that we've made an unwise decision, don't keep going in the same course. Stop and change direction.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:30.060
These lessons can be summarized in the words of Proverbs 22 verse 3. There we told,

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:35.059
the shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself,

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:42.059
but the inexperience keeps right on going and suffer the consequences.

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:50.059
Yes, we need to see the possible consequences of wrong decisions and then take action to avoid them.

00:08:50.059 --> 00:08:56.059
What were some of the consequences of Jehosephat's unwise decisions?

00:08:56.059 --> 00:09:01.059
It nearly cost him his life. His oldest son died in apostate,

00:09:01.059 --> 00:09:13.059
and later his daughter-in-law, Atholaya, killed all the heirs to the throne except one baby and set herself up as queen of Judah.

00:09:13.059 --> 00:09:21.059
But you might be thinking, still Jehosephat viewed Jehosephat as a good king. Yes, he did.

00:09:21.059 --> 00:09:27.059
And it's encouraging for us to know that even if we have made some unwise decisions,

00:09:27.059 --> 00:09:33.059
it's possible that Jehosephat may still view us as his faithful servants.

00:09:33.059 --> 00:09:39.059
Does that mean, then, that our decisions are not so important?

00:09:39.059 --> 00:09:44.059
The Watchtower back in 1980 made this interesting comparison.

00:09:44.059 --> 00:09:48.059
It used an illustration of two ship captains.

00:09:48.059 --> 00:09:55.059
One skillfully maneuvered his ship through a storm, bringing the vessel and his crew safely to shore,

00:09:55.059 --> 00:09:59.059
but the other captain made unwise decisions.

00:09:59.059 --> 00:10:07.059
And because of that, he experienced shipwreck during the same storm, saving only his life.

00:10:07.059 --> 00:10:19.059
While both captains escaped with their lives, the one whose ship remained intact would certainly enjoy greater happiness and honour, wouldn't he?

00:10:19.059 --> 00:10:23.059
It's obvious which captain Jehosephat was like.

00:10:23.059 --> 00:10:33.059
Unlike Jehosephat, surely we'd prefer to be like the successful captain, the one whose ship remained intact.

00:10:33.059 --> 00:10:38.059
How can we make sure that we are like the successful captain?

00:10:38.059 --> 00:10:48.059
Back in 2011, the April Watchtower had a special chart entitled Steps to Making Good Decisions.

00:10:48.059 --> 00:10:54.059
It listed these steps in making wise decisions.

00:10:54.059 --> 00:10:58.059
One, avoid being presumptuous.

00:10:58.059 --> 00:11:02.059
Two, do research.

00:11:02.059 --> 00:11:05.059
Three, pray for wisdom.

00:11:05.059 --> 00:11:08.059
Four, make the decision.

00:11:08.059 --> 00:11:11.059
Five, implement the decision.

00:11:11.059 --> 00:11:14.059
But then there was an additional step.

00:11:14.059 --> 00:11:18.059
Six, review and adjust.

00:11:18.059 --> 00:11:20.059
Why is Step 6 listed?

00:11:20.059 --> 00:11:27.059
Well, from time to time, we need to review decisions we've already made.

00:11:27.059 --> 00:11:35.059
As we do so, perhaps we'll come to realise that some of them were not the best decisions.

00:11:35.059 --> 00:11:38.059
Can you still be like the successful captain?

00:11:38.059 --> 00:11:40.059
Yes, you can.

00:11:40.059 --> 00:11:41.059
How?

00:11:41.059 --> 00:11:45.059
If you courageously make the needed adjustments.

00:11:45.059 --> 00:11:51.059
We must acknowledge that not all decisions work out exactly as we had planned.

00:11:51.059 --> 00:11:59.059
As Ecclesiastes 9-11 reminds us, time and unexpected events overtake us all.

00:11:59.059 --> 00:12:03.059
So what should we do if that's the case?

00:12:03.059 --> 00:12:09.059
The same Watchtower in 2011 answers that question for us.

00:12:09.059 --> 00:12:17.059
After saying that Jehovah expects us to live up to such decisions as our dedication and our marriage vows,

00:12:17.059 --> 00:12:19.059
it went on to say,

00:12:19.059 --> 00:12:23.059
most decisions, though, are less waiting.

00:12:23.059 --> 00:12:29.059
A wise person will, from time to time, review the decisions he has made.

00:12:29.059 --> 00:12:36.059
He will not let pride or stubbornness prevent him from adjusting or even reversing a decision.

00:12:37.059 --> 00:12:45.059
His prime concern is to make sure that his life course continues to honor God.

00:12:45.059 --> 00:12:54.059
Thinking back to the illustration of the two captains, at times they may need to reverse a former unwise decision.

00:12:54.059 --> 00:13:00.059
That happened during a hurricane back in 1889.

00:13:00.059 --> 00:13:11.059
The captain of the British ship Caliope was anchored in the harbor in Apia, Western Samoa, when a hurricane started blowing.

00:13:11.059 --> 00:13:18.059
Initially, he decided like all the other captains in the harbor to weather the storm where he was.

00:13:18.059 --> 00:13:27.059
But as the waves grew in height and the dangers increased, the captain realized he had made the wrong decision.

00:13:27.059 --> 00:13:29.059
What did he do?

00:13:29.059 --> 00:13:35.059
He courageously reversed his decision and headed out to open sea.

00:13:35.059 --> 00:13:45.059
It was difficult, but ultimately he saved himself, his ship, and the 250 sailors on board.

00:13:45.059 --> 00:13:50.059
This bold act of courage ended him into the annals of naval history.

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:59.340
To be like that courageous captain, at times we need to prayerfully reexamine our past decisions.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:07.340
These could be decisions about our employment, entertainment, education, or even where we live.

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:13.340
When we made the original decisions, they may have seemed wise to us.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:17.340
But do they still seem that way now?

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:24.340
If we see the dangerous winds of bad consequences and the frightening waves of disaster approaching,

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:30.340
because our decisions were not completely in harmony with Jehovah's will, what should we do?

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.340
Be like the wise captain.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:41.340
Don't worry about losing face, be courageous, pray for Jehovah's help, and then take bold action.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:46.340
Make the changes you need to make in order to continue to please Jehovah.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:50.340
In this way, you'll make the wise decision.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:55.340
The one that leads to success, the one that Jehovah will bless.
