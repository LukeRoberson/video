00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:13.630
My name is Anje Santa Liestra Fierro.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:23.039
I studied medicine and surgery at the Central University and the Hasbro Clinic of Barcelona.

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.239
Childbirth is awe-inspiring.

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:34.479
For example, when a mother's efforts culminate in childbirth, that intimate bond formed between

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:39.320
a mother and its baby is something I will never get tired of seeing.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.039
Even though I've witnessed it, dozens of times.

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:50.259
I was born into a devout Catholic family.

00:00:50.259 --> 00:01:01.909
From the moment I started studying at the university, everything I learned was in favor of evolution.

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:08.590
These studies impacted me, even though I didn't have a strong foundation and evolution.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.500
But deep inside me, I believed in evolution.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:21.340
But I didn't have much of an alternative.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.260
Perhaps my own selfishness was also to blame because I didn't have to answer to God for

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.340
my conduct.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.269
I could do things that I had been told as a boy were forbidden.

00:01:34.269 --> 00:01:39.989
And so the figure of God slowly began to crumble in my mind.

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:43.189
I read a book entitled Life.

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:44.469
How did it get here?

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:46.790
By evolution or by creation?

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.870
Well, I read through the whole book that very same day.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.230
And I saw so much evidence that I immediately wanted to show the book to my colleagues

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.030
at the hospital.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.950
At the time, I was still finishing my specialized training in pediatrics.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.180
Some of them called me a heretic.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:16.949
For me, that book marked the beginning of my belief in an alternative to the theory of evolution.

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:24.229
We all started, both you and I, every single human being as a single cell.

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:28.870
But this single cell did not just produce a human.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.430
It also produced the placenta.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.949
For a mother, it's foreign tissue, and yet it allows her to transfer all the life and

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:40.509
potential she has to her unborn child.

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:42.830
This is truly amazing.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:49.659
It must have required a lot for somebody to have designed something like this.

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:53.659
This encourages me to believe that a creator exists.

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:59.099
I can only conclude that it is worth the effort to spend time getting to know the person

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.099
who designed it.
