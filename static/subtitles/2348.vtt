00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.060
Why should we speak with conviction?

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.059
Because our conviction can convey more powerfully than words alone

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:22.059
how we really feel about our message.

00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:26.059
At first, that's only in 1.5, the Apostle Paul wrote,

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:30.059
the good news we preached did not come to you with speech alone,

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:33.060
but with strong conviction.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.060
So how do we show that we're convinced

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:43.060
that the good news of God's kingdom is the most valuable message we could share?

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.060
First, we prepare thoroughly.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:53.060
In other words, we convince ourselves of the value of our message.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.060
Second, we choose words that convey our conviction.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:06.060
And finally, we express ourselves earnestly and sincerely.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.060
For instance, how would you express yourself if you were giving a talk about the resurrection?

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.060
Let's watch an example.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.060
Jesus resurrected Lazarus.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.060
How can that Bible account help us?

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:29.060
Well, if we have lost loved ones in death, we can put our trust in the resurrection.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.060
The speaker is correct.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.060
But did he express firm conviction?

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.060
Not really.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:45.060
We learn how to express ourselves with conviction from Jesus and Martha in this very Bible account.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.060
John 11, 23 records Jesus' words.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.060
Your brother will rise.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.060
With these words, Jesus expressed complete conviction.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.060
Also, verse 24 records Martha's reply.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.060
I know he will rise in the resurrection on the last day.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.060
Martha too expressed her firm conviction.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.060
Let's now give our brother another chance.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.060
Jesus resurrected Lazarus.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.060
How does this Bible account help us?

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.060
Well, when loved ones fall asleep in death, we know we'll see them again.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.060
The fulfillment of Jehovah's promises is as sure as the sun rising each day.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.060
Jehovah will awaken our dear loved ones to life and paradise.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.060
What a difference.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:49.060
Not only did the speaker express himself earnestly, but he chose words that showed his firm belief in the resurrection hope.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.889
Can we express similar conviction in the ministry?

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:56.889
Yes.

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:01.889
And this is especially important when our faith is challenged.

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:11.889
Imagine, for instance, that a schoolmate, a teacher, or a workmate express a surprise that you don't join in a certain celebration.

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:14.889
How will you respond?

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:18.889
So you're coming to the Christmas party next week, right?

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:20.889
I don't think I can make it.

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.889
What do you mean?

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:24.889
Everybody's going to be there?

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:26.889
I'm kind of busy.

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:32.889
Plus, I'd fill out a place I don't celebrate Christmas.

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:39.889
Our sister wasn't prepared to address a common situation during the holiday season.

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:45.889
With more preparation, she could have responded with conviction.

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:47.889
Let's watch.

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.889
So you're coming to the Christmas party next week, right?

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:53.889
I appreciate the invitation. I won't be going.

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:57.889
You won't be going. Everybody's going to be there.

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:01.889
I've made a personal decision not to celebrate Christmas.

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:03.889
Really? Why?

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:11.889
I'm one of Jehovah's Witnesses, and I've learned through a study of the Bible that Jesus wasn't really born in December.

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:17.889
And that Christmas is based on unscriptural customs and ideas.

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:24.889
If you have just a moment, I'd like to show you a web article that discusses the origin of some Christmas customs.

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.889
Sure.

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:32.889
Because our sister spoke with conviction, she actually peaked the interest of her coworker.

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:43.810
Of course, expressing ourselves with conviction should not be confused with being tactless, opinionated, or pushy.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.810
By appealing to our listeners in a loving manner, expressed with conviction,

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.810
we will draw still others to the glorious good news found in God's Word.
