00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:07.570
How do you feel about doing things that you do well?

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.289
Have you ever noticed that people who are experts at what they do seem to enjoy the job,

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:16.690
whatever it is, and they delight in training others?

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.289
This is because the more people there are who understand how to support a project, make

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:27.170
music, or play a game, the more enjoyable it is when we combine forces as a group, a

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.969
team, an orchestra.

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:35.490
There's a direct correlation between skill and joy.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:40.009
So how do you feel about the work of making disciples?

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:43.530
Turn with me please to Luke chapter 10.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.929
Jesus loved making disciples.

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:55.609
Psalm 40 and verse 8 says prophetically concerning Jesus to do your will, oh my God, is my delight.

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:01.530
And notice here that Luke 10 21 tells us that when Jesus was contemplating the results

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:11.329
of a particular preaching campaign, he became overjoyed, overjoyed in the Holy Spirit.

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:16.409
Jesus was a masterful teacher, but as this chapter of the Bible shows, he helped his

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.450
disciples to become skillful as well.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:27.530
And thus as pointed out at Luke 10 17, they also found joy in this work.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.969
Our joy grows as we work to improve our skills.

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:38.569
So this symposium will discuss six essential skills that can help us to become not just

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:44.689
more effective preachers, but effective disciple makers.

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.930
What skills are required?

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.930
To see them listed on your program, asking questions, unleashing the power of God's

00:01:52.930 --> 00:02:00.170
word, illustrating key points, teaching with enthusiasm, showing empathy, and reaching

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.290
the heart.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:08.610
This symposium includes a series of dramatizations that follow the progress of one Bible student.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.729
After each video we'll discuss the skill that was featured and how we can use it.

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:19.449
This will help us to experience more joy in our disciple making work.

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:20.969
Are you ready?

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:23.729
Let's discuss our first skill.

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:28.289
Asking questions, why should we ask questions?

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:30.770
Questions serve a number of purposes.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.569
Sometimes we pose them just to stimulate interest and to get the conversation rolling.

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.930
At other times we're interested in hearing how a person thinks so that we can know better

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.050
how to direct the conversation.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.129
Return with me, please, to Matthew chapter 22.

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.530
Jesus knew what was in man.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.090
He could read hearts, so he didn't need people to tell him where they stood on certain

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.090
issues.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:03.370
Still, he used questions to encourage his listeners to reason things out for themselves.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:12.250
Notice how he did that here in Matthew chapter 22 verses 41 through 45.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.889
Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them.

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.409
What do you think about the Christ?

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.050
Whose son is he?

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.650
They said to him, David's.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:32.449
He asked them, how is it then that David under inspiration calls him Lord, saying, Jehovah

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:38.930
said to my Lord, sit at my right hand until I put your enemies beneath your feet.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.330
If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.330
Four questions.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:53.650
Now, wouldn't it have been easier, quicker, just to tell people the answers?

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.650
Possibly.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.770
But those questions led honest-hearted ones to draw accurate conclusions for themselves,

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:06.210
while at the same time revealing the true motives of opposers.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.409
Are powerful.

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:15.689
But when we use them, we should keep in mind the words of James 119.

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:19.810
Notice what this says, James 119.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.009
Know this, my beloved brothers.

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:26.370
Everyone must be quick to listen.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.370
Slow to speak.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.089
Slow to anger.

00:04:31.089 --> 00:04:35.730
To ask a question without waiting for the answer would be like making an appointment to

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.689
meet a friend, but then leaving before he arrived.

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:46.050
It was our question, so we should wait for the answer, wait for it, not in a way that

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.649
makes people feel uncomfortable, but by listening kindly.

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:57.850
By listening, we, in effect, say, you are important to me.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.129
Now, unlike Jesus, we don't already know what's going on inside of people, so it's not

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:08.290
until they answer our question that we can tailor our comments to fit their situation.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:06:53.310
In the following dramatization, notice how a disciple-maker uses questions skillfully.

00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:14.589
No, like I'm jaded.

00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:19.769
Are you going to share something or what?

00:07:19.769 --> 00:07:21.769
Um, yeah.

00:07:21.769 --> 00:07:24.769
Did you know the Bible says you can live forever?

00:07:24.769 --> 00:07:27.769
Heaven, that's what you're sharing.

00:07:27.769 --> 00:07:29.769
That's not exactly new, is it?

00:07:29.769 --> 00:07:33.769
No, I mean, did you know the Bible says you can live forever on earth?

00:07:33.769 --> 00:07:35.769
But why would I want that?

00:07:35.769 --> 00:07:36.769
This place is a mess.

00:07:36.769 --> 00:07:38.769
But it won't be in the future.

00:07:38.769 --> 00:07:43.769
Revelation 21 verse 4 promises.

00:07:43.769 --> 00:07:49.769
And tea will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more.

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:53.769
Neither will morning nor outcry, nor pain be any more.

00:07:53.769 --> 00:07:56.769
The former things have passed away.

00:07:56.769 --> 00:08:01.769
Since there's no death or pain in heaven, where would this promise apply?

00:08:01.769 --> 00:08:11.509
I didn't know the Bible said that.

00:08:11.509 --> 00:08:14.399
Wicked.

00:08:14.399 --> 00:08:15.399
I mean, that's cool.

00:08:15.399 --> 00:08:16.399
Oh, okay.

00:08:16.399 --> 00:08:20.399
Would you like to learn how to be part of that future?

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:21.399
Uh, yeah.

00:08:21.399 --> 00:08:22.399
Um, thanks.

00:08:22.399 --> 00:08:25.399
I'm not really the chatty type.

00:08:25.399 --> 00:08:28.399
And I'm late, so see you later.

00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:38.679
Did you notice how Nita prefaced some of her questions?

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:40.679
Did you know?

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:43.679
Did you know the Bible says you can live forever?

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:48.679
No, I mean, did you know the Bible says you can live forever on earth?

00:08:48.679 --> 00:08:53.679
A thought-provoking question to get the conversation started.

00:08:53.679 --> 00:08:57.679
Now, maybe it's been a little while since you were able to stand in a public place with a

00:08:57.679 --> 00:09:00.679
witnessing card as we saw Nita doing here.

00:09:00.679 --> 00:09:06.679
But we can have conversations on the phone, perhaps in stores, in the park.

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:09.679
Questions also work well in letters.

00:09:09.679 --> 00:09:13.679
Of course, it's easy for us to think of questions on topics that interest us.

00:09:13.679 --> 00:09:20.679
But what is needed is to think of questions that others will enjoy answering.

00:09:20.679 --> 00:09:28.679
Such questions as, did you know that the Bible describes a time when sickness will be no more?

00:09:28.679 --> 00:09:32.679
Do you think we'll ever see true economic security?

00:09:32.679 --> 00:09:35.679
It would be nice to be able to plan.

00:09:35.679 --> 00:09:40.679
What do you think is a reliable source of information about the future?

00:09:40.679 --> 00:09:45.679
Do you think we could be living in what the Bible calls the last days?

00:09:45.679 --> 00:09:50.679
I've noticed that many people still pray, especially when they have problems.

00:09:50.679 --> 00:09:54.679
Do you think anyone listens to prayers?

00:09:54.679 --> 00:09:57.679
Does God listen to all prayers?

00:09:57.679 --> 00:09:59.679
Viewpoint questions.

00:09:59.679 --> 00:10:03.679
Viewpoint questions invite people to express their thoughts.

00:10:03.679 --> 00:10:08.679
Often, Jesus would pause, ask people what they thought,

00:10:08.679 --> 00:10:11.679
and then listen to their response.

00:10:11.679 --> 00:10:18.679
For example, after the death of Martha's brother Lazarus, Jesus told her as recorded in John chapter 11 verses 25 and 26.

00:10:18.679 --> 00:10:23.679
Everyone who was living and exercises faith in me will never die at all.

00:10:23.679 --> 00:10:26.679
But then he asked her,

00:10:26.679 --> 00:10:30.679
Do you believe this?

00:10:30.679 --> 00:10:34.679
Do you believe this?

00:10:34.679 --> 00:10:38.679
And then he listened, as she expressed her faith.

00:10:38.679 --> 00:10:43.679
This type of question can be very effective in our disciple-making work.

00:10:43.679 --> 00:10:48.679
Or, like Jesus, we can use a series of questions to help people reason.

00:10:48.679 --> 00:10:52.679
In the video, did you notice how after reading Revelation 214,

00:10:52.679 --> 00:10:54.679
Nita asked Jade,

00:10:54.679 --> 00:10:59.679
Since there's no death or pain in heaven, where would this promise apply?

00:10:59.679 --> 00:11:01.679
And then she asked,

00:11:01.679 --> 00:11:05.679
Would you like to learn how to be a part of that future?

00:11:05.679 --> 00:11:10.679
We improve our skills by imitating Jesus.

00:11:10.679 --> 00:11:14.679
And as our skill improves, our joy increases.

00:11:14.679 --> 00:11:18.679
Jesus delighted to make disciples and we can too.

00:11:18.679 --> 00:11:22.679
By asking questions and then listening to people's answers,

00:11:22.679 --> 00:11:25.679
we may help some of them to accept the good news.

00:11:25.679 --> 00:11:32.679
And we will definitely experience first hand the joy of disciple-making.

00:11:32.679 --> 00:11:35.679
Brother Patrick LaFranca, a helper to the personnel committee,

00:11:35.679 --> 00:11:38.679
will now present the next part of this symposium,

00:11:38.679 --> 00:11:42.679
Experience the joy of disciple-making, improve your skills,

00:11:42.679 --> 00:11:46.679
Unleashing the power of God's Word.
