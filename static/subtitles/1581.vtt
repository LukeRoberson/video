00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Everything happened so fast.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Everyone thought that because so much blood was lost, my life was in danger, and I would need a blood transfusion.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.550
The medical professionals were describing treatments that I wasn't familiar with.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:27.339
I was in my mind trying to think, have I heard of this? Do I know what this is? Have I read about it?

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:36.340
She explained it was a complicated surgery, and that because I didn't take blood, it would be obviously more serious.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:43.340
We love life, and in any medical situation, we want treatments that preserve or restore our health.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.340
But more important, we want to respect the creator of life and his law on blood.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.200
God first spoke that law to Noah's family.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.200
After the flood, God told them the animals could serve as food, but he added,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.200
only flesh with its life. It's blood you must not eat.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.200
Blood represents the life of a creature and should not be misused.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.200
God repeated this law to ancient Israel with clear instructions.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.200
You must not eat it. You should pour it out on the ground like water.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.200
It was the same for early Christians. They received written direction to keep abstaining from blood.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:35.200
Jehovah's Witnesses still obey that command today, even though it can be a challenge to understand how that command should be applied to the numerous medical treatments now available.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:44.200
Donated whole blood is often separated into its four main components, red cells, white cells, platelets, and plasma.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:52.200
We abstain from blood by refusing to accept the transfusion of whole blood or of any of those four main components.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.200
How did one brother demonstrate the strength necessary to abstain from blood during an emergency?

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.200
When it comes to blood, we have to be prepared.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:11.199
So that's what I did. I researched it and I prayed to Jehovah so that I could understand his thoughts and follow them.

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:16.199
And then I wrote down my wishes.

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:20.199
I never thought that I would have such an accident.

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:27.199
I'm very thankful to Jehovah that he helped me understand all of these things.

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:35.539
And because of that, I was able to make and stick to a decision that pleases him.

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:40.539
Blood fractions are things that are extracted from any one of the four main blood components.

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:49.539
But the Bible does not provide specific direction about using these fractions, so to accept them or not is a personal decision.

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:53.539
Some believe that a small isolated fraction is no longer blood.

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:56.539
Others feel they can't use anything that came from blood.

00:02:56.539 --> 00:03:02.539
How did one sister make an informed decision about which medications containing blood fractions to accept?

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:09.539
When it came to fractions, for me the challenge was figuring out what I really felt about it.

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:15.539
And deciding for myself what I would or wouldn't accept and why.

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:19.539
At stake is our relationship with Jehovah and having a clean conscience before him.

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:24.539
So it's something that no one else could have done for me.

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:31.539
I had to make clear to my doctor that I absolutely would not accept blood or any of the four main components.

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:38.539
And I also explained to him what medications and other treatments that I was willing to accept.

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:44.539
What questions should Christians ask themselves about medical procedures involving their own blood?

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:53.539
What if during the course of a therapy or procedure some of my blood will be diverted outside my body and the flow might be interrupted for a time?

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:57.539
Does my conscience allow me to view this blood as still part of me?

00:03:57.539 --> 00:04:00.539
Thus not requiring that it be poured out on the ground.

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:09.819
What if during a medical procedure some of my own blood will be withdrawn, modified and directed back into or onto my body?

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.819
Does it trouble my Bible train conscience or could I accept such a procedure?

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:22.819
Am I aware that refusing all medical procedures involving the use of my own blood means that I would not accept a blood test,

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:27.819
hemodialysis or the use of a heart lung bypass machine?

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:32.819
What did one sister do to ensure she made a decision that would not disturb her conscience?

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:36.819
So my doctor presented me with an effective alternative procedure.

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:44.819
It was something that I knew about but I asked her to clarify the details to make sure that what she was talking about was okay with my conscience.

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:53.259
So I made it a personal study project and I also asked a mature friend to help me go through all the information.

00:04:53.259 --> 00:05:00.259
I made my decision with a clean conscience and I knew it would make Jehovah's Heart glad.

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:04.259
How can you make informed decisions about the medical use of blood?

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:08.259
Pray for God's wisdom and Holy Spirit.

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:14.259
Meditate on what the Bible teaches and learn about the medical treatments that may be offered to you.

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:18.259
If needed, ask for help to understand the options.

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:22.259
And finally, put your decisions in writing.

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:29.259
Jehovah God knows what is best for us and when I resolve to obey him as tested he doesn't want us to feel alone.

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:32.259
He wants to help us.

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:40.259
When we accept his help and show respect for life that comes from him, we can look forward to a paradise with perfect health and everlasting life.
