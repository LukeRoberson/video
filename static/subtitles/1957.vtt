00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:11.419
Is marriage a source of happiness or heartbreak?

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:20.030
So many married couples just endure unhappily.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:28.839
Other couples separate and large numbers end in divorce.

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:34.840
And yet, some have found great happiness and contentment in marriage.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.840
How? What makes the difference?

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.840
They have learned God's view of marriage, found in the Bible.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.840
After all, God originated marriage and He wants married couples to be happy.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.840
So how does God view marriage?

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.840
The Bible says that God made them male and female.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.840
What God has yoke together, let no man put apart.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.840
God views marriage as a permanent bond between a man and a woman.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.840
He wants them to be faithful to each other.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.840
By following the Bible's advice to legalize their marriage,

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.840
a couple show that they recognize the importance of their union

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.840
and they enjoy greater security.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.340
When they view their marriage as permanent,

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.340
they're more likely to work together to solve their problems.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.340
While the Bible realistically acknowledges that couples will face challenges,

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.340
it also provides advice from God that helps to work through disagreements.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.340
For example, the Bible says,

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.340
each one of you must love his wife as he does himself.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.340
On the other hand, the wife should have deep respect for her husband.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:09.340
Through the Bible, God teaches couples to display qualities that build a happy marriage,

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.340
like being kind, patient, and forgiving.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.340
The Bible also emphasizes the value of being a good listener.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.340
Regardless of how long two people have been married,

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.340
they can find happiness when they share God's view of marriage.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.340
Do you need help in your marriage with regard to money problems,

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.340
health issues, relatives,

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.479
or raising children?

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:48.479
