00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:11.720
When we read the text for today, it gives us another reason to praise our Heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:21.719
Because when we think about how Jehovah keeps us well informed, especially in regards to what to expect for the future,

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:25.719
is a truly wonderful blessing.

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:30.719
And Jehovah not only reveals the future.

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:33.719
He makes it happen.

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.719
Notice what is stated in Isaiah chapter 44 in verse 26.

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.719
Isaiah 44, 26,

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:53.719
The one making the Word of his servant come true,

00:00:53.719 --> 00:01:04.719
and completely fulfilling the predictions of his messengers, tremendous blessing we have with Jehovah.

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:08.719
And as we analyze the interpretation of Daniel of the image,

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:20.719
we see that the interpretation deals with specific world kingdoms that did rise up in the world scene.

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:23.719
Those kingdoms did exist.

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:29.719
Well, we see the golden head, Babylon in verse 28 to chapter 2.

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:34.719
The second kingdom, the silver chest and arms in verse 39.

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:36.719
Middle Persia.

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:43.719
In the same verse 39, the third kingdom, the copper of diamond and thyshe, Greece.

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:48.719
In verse 40, the kingdom, the iron legs, Rome.

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:55.719
So there is no question that this kingdom did exist.

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:03.719
But we note that there is no mention of a fifth kingdom.

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:12.030
So how do we know that the feet represent a different world power?

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.030
How can we explain that the feet represent the Anglo-American power?

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.030
Well, let's analyze a few scriptural points that will help us.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:35.030
We note that the description of the feet conveys the idea that what is represented by the feet would emerge from Rome,

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:44.030
rather than conquer Rome, as it was the case with the other kingdoms that were previously mentioned.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:58.030
Because we notice in the image Daniel sees the same metal, the iron and the legs, extending down through the feet and toes.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:09.030
So we could say that this fourth kingdom in Daniel chapter 2 represents two world powers.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:18.030
Now, on this point, Daniel chapter 7 provides a very interesting detail, a key detail.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:31.030
In Daniel's prophecy in Daniel chapter 7, he outlines the same four kingdoms that were mentioned in Daniel chapter 2, but describe as beasts.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:43.030
In the description of the four beasts corresponds with what we read in Daniel chapter 2 for the fourth kingdom.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:55.030
But in Daniel chapter 7, the fourth beast, which is Rome, reveals a key element of this particular beast.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:02.030
Let's read it together. Daniel chapter 7 and let's read the verse 8.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:08.919
Well, I consider the horns, the horns of the beast.

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:19.920
Look, another horn, a small one came up among them, and three of the first horns were plucked up from before it.

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:33.259
So we note that a particular horn grows out of the beast, Rome, in the horn and limb in these three other horns.

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:43.259
Now, history shows that at some point Britain became a part of the Roman Empire.

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:56.259
Then in the late 1700s, Britain, a former part of the Roman Empire, began rising to prominence.

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:06.259
And as the small horn, Britain eliminated three other horns, France, Spain, and the Netherlands.

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:19.259
By 1870, Britain had become the largest empire on earth, and had the most powerful military force.

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:23.259
So really, it was an empire.

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:41.259
But then this symbolic horn, originally imperial Britain, developed into the Anglo-American world power when Britain and the United States forged a special partnership during World War I.

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:44.259
And there is an additional point.

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:56.259
Revelation 1710 shows that after Rome, one more world power was due to come, another head, seven heads.

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:11.259
And the further reason that the fourth kingdom in Daniel chapter 2 represents not only the Roman Empire, is revealed by the words of our text for today, Daniel 228.

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:24.259
Because here, Daniel, in the interpretation to Naviconessor, includes what was going to happen in the final part of the days.

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:33.259
And the Anglo-American power has come into existence in the final part of the days.

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:45.259
What will distinguish the Anglo-American power from the previous kingdoms mentioned in Daniel chapter 2 is the mixture of clay and iron.

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:55.259
So the Anglo-American power will be a little weaker than the power from which it emerged Rome.

00:06:55.259 --> 00:07:00.259
But here is the question, what does all this means for us?

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:10.120
Daniel told Naviconessor, the interpretation is trustworthy.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.120
So it's not just a story.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.120
We know the interpretation is accurate.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:23.120
We know that there was a Babylonian empire.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:32.120
There was a Middle Persian empire, there was a Greek empire, there was a Roman empire, and there is an Anglo-American world power.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:37.120
These were real powers, governments.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:46.120
So history bears out the opposite of the description that Daniel shows in chapter 2 and the order of appearance in the world scene.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:52.120
But here is the question, we know those were powers were real.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:08:02.120
But are we convinced that the stone, God's kingdom, God's government is also real?

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.120
Is that how we feel about it?

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:11.120
Are we convinced that the stone will destroy all the other kingdoms?

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:18.120
And if so, are we supporting God's kingdom?

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:27.120
Well, the path fulfillment of the portions of Daniel chapter 2 reveals that the remaining portion will soon be fulfilled.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:34.120
But the stone is coming, it's going to hit the feet just a matter of time.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:40.120
But here is another point of meditation as we read this information.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:47.120
It took courage for Daniel to tell Naviconessor your kingdom is going to go.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.120
It's going to be destroyed, it's going to be conquered.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.120
Now that was not easy.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:09:03.120
Daniel didn't know what reaction was going to come up from Naviconessor because Naviconessor was not in a good mood when that interpretation was provided.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:10.120
He was going to kill all the wise men, including Daniel, if they could not tell him the dream.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:21.370
So what is our position in regards to what Jehovah has revealed to us in Daniel 244?

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:35.370
Do we personally have the courage, like Daniel, to preach that message, especially perhaps, that in a more direct way is going to take place in the future?

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:38.370
Something to think about, isn't it?

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:53.370
So May our faith in what Jehovah has revealed to us for the future, move us to prove that we believe in God's kingdom, that we support God's kingdom,

00:09:53.370 --> 00:10:01.370
and that we will have and continue to have the courage to preach it is a real government.
