00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.040
I'm pleased to find Galatians 5 with me.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:14.839
Our text is verse 26, but we would first like to read Galatians 5, 16, says, but I say,

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:24.000
keep walking by spirit and you will carry out no fleshly desire at all, walking by spirit.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.960
What does that mean?

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.760
What has nothing to do with how we put our feet on the floor, walking in this case is

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.420
talking about a course of life, our conduct, our behavior.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.979
So Paul saying, if we behave by the spirit, we will carry out no fleshly desire at all.

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:46.759
Now he did not say we would not have fleshly desires.

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:50.799
We may still be battling some fleshly desire.

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:55.719
But he did say if we follow the lead of the spirit, we will not succumb, we will not

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:57.240
give into it.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.359
He said, you will carry out no fleshly desire at all.

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.159
But now let's turn to verses 19 to 21 of Galatians 5.

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:12.200
There are 15 specific wrong actions or attitudes enumerated.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.799
Let's review these sorted players of Satan.

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:25.799
Now the English word sorted means characterized by filth or marked by grossness, which seems

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.079
to be a good fit for Satan and his influences.

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.200
So let's read 19 to 21.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.000
Now the works of the flesh are plainly seen, so they're that obvious.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:46.439
And they are sexual immorality, uncleanness, brazen conduct, idolatry, spiritism, hostility,

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:55.719
life, jealousy, fits of anger, dissentions, division, sex, envy, drunkenness, wild parties,

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:59.000
and things like these.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:09.080
15 specific, negative, offensive, dirty, inappropriate actions or attitudes that are disapproved by

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.560
our clean, pure, and holy God, Jehovah.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.479
Now the works of the flesh, they all play for Satan's side of the issue.

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:17.680
It's like he has his own soccer team.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.039
Of course, in soccer, there is usually per team, 11 on the field at any given time.

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:28.800
But here we have 15 issues, specifically mentioned, and they all wear the uniform of Satan.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.719
He hand picked them.

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:40.240
So did you notice at the end of verse 21, generic grouping, it said, and things like these.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.439
So there's actually more than just 15 works of the flesh.

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:51.280
These answers are more like a substitute player sitting on the bench, waiting for Satan

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.680
to call them onto the playing field, so that they can bring their dastardly tricks to

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.439
play against us.

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:04.719
Our text for today mentions one of the things like these.

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:09.680
So look at verse 26, it's like the works of the flesh mentioned earlier.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.680
It says, let us not become egotistical.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.639
That's a work of the flesh that's sitting on the bench, and Satan will try to capitalize

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.520
on it if we have that tendency.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.000
And what is a egotistical person's behavior?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.960
Look at the rest of verse 26.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.800
Playing up competition with one another, and being one another.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.919
So like a soccer team, these individual works of the flesh play off of each other.

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:49.319
In fact, you may have noticed in our text 26, it gave an example of this egotistical

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.240
playing off another work of the flesh, and being.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.000
Well, what does the word egotistical mean?

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:04.360
Well, the study note, on the verse 26, it says, the Greek word rendered egotistical,

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.759
literally conveys the idea of empty glory, vain glory.

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:19.000
One lexicon defines it as having exaggerated self-conceptions, conceited, boastful, empty

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.199
glory.

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:29.160
So an egotistical person is nothing more than a bag of wind, empty glory.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.959
And since we're right here in Galatians, look at chapter 6, verse 3, it describes such

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:41.120
a person, well, 6-3 says, if anyone thinks he's something egotistical, when he is nothing,

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:47.529
he's empty, he's deceiving himself.

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:53.610
So the egotistical person stirs up competition, trying to prove that he's better than someone

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.449
else.

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.290
He's nothing but a bag of hot air.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:05.689
I looked up the word competition in an English dictionary, and this is what it said.

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:14.370
A common struggle for the same object, especially among individuals of relatively equal standing.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.329
And that seems to hold true.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:23.410
Let's say a ministerial servant who has a tendency to be egotistical, he doesn't stir

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.730
up competition with the elders, he usually, wittingly run, wittingly, stirs up competition

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.170
with fellow ministerial servants.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.850
And the elders don't compete with the circuit over here, the circuit over here doesn't stir

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.050
up competition with the branch committee and so forth.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:45.930
So the place to analyze if we have this tendency is among our peers.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.490
And let's be frank about the seriousness of this.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:57.529
Satan's works of the flesh team is not a soccer team playing on a field.

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:03.610
No, that was just an illustration of them cooperating together to beat us as we try to walk

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.209
by the spirit.

00:06:05.209 --> 00:06:10.250
In reality, Satan's temptations, his fleshly desires and so forth, they might be better

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:17.649
like into, instead of a sports field, a battlefield, because Satan's at war with our Christian

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:19.490
personality.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:26.089
And that's why in Ephesians 6, the Apostle Paul used the illustration, not of a uniform,

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:30.370
but of a suit of armor that Christians must maintain.

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:37.610
However, in our text for today, the context of Galatians 5, what else could we use to counteract

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:42.490
the works of the flesh, including the element, digitistical?

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.689
Well you guessed it, it's the fruities of the spirit.

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:52.930
As outlined in verses 22 and 23, if we could look at that, 22 and 23, on the other hand,

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.730
the fruities of the spirit is love.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:59.769
And you know that one quality love pretty much counteracts every one of the works of the

00:06:59.769 --> 00:07:00.769
flesh.

00:07:00.769 --> 00:07:07.410
But then you add to that joy piece, that's our convention theme for 2022, patience, kindness,

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:14.170
goodness, faith, mildness, self-control, against such things, against such things, there

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.170
is no law, such things.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:21.730
So similar to the works of the flesh, the list of these aspects of the fruities of the

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.649
spirit is not all-inclusive.

00:07:25.649 --> 00:07:31.529
Joe's spirit can produce other qualities that become additional aspects of his Holy

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:33.129
Spirit.

00:07:33.129 --> 00:07:38.089
So in our discussion thus far, we have learned that digitistical is the work of the flesh

00:07:38.089 --> 00:07:40.209
that we should strive to avoid.

00:07:40.209 --> 00:07:46.810
And you remember the 1st Scripture read, Galatians 5, 16, walked by spirit and you will carry

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:49.810
out no flesh to desire at all?

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:54.610
Well in March 15, 2010 issue, the watchtower had a good illustration.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:59.730
It explained that it's like a farmer who's producing a crop.

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:03.329
He has to work hard to cultivate the soil.

00:08:03.329 --> 00:08:09.250
Individually we need to work hard to cultivate the fruities of the spirit in our life.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:13.370
But more is needed than us personally working hard to be good.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:17.889
If the farmer does not have sunlight, all of his work is for naught.

00:08:17.889 --> 00:08:22.209
The article explained that the Holy Spirit is like sunshine.

00:08:22.209 --> 00:08:26.209
The warm ray shine on our backs as we try to avoid the works of the flesh.

00:08:26.209 --> 00:08:30.370
The ray shine on the soil in which we toil.

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:35.970
The fruities of the spirit germinate and sprouts and even additional aspects to those mentioned

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:40.809
in Galatians 5 grow within us.

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:44.330
We become more and more Christ-like.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:48.889
And no, we do not accept Satan's taunt to play his game.

00:08:48.889 --> 00:08:52.450
In fact, we stay off the playing field.

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:59.009
And even though we're still imperfect and we may have wrong desires and tendencies,

00:08:59.009 --> 00:09:03.370
even though that's true, we don't give in to them.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:09.049
We do not carry them out, including a tendency to be egotistical.
