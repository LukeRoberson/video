00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:05.330
Welcome to JW Broadcasting.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.009
In this month's program, we'll learn how even as imperfect people, we can imitate

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:14.009
Jehovah's way of thinking.

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.850
Jim McCabe went from cross-examining the teachings of Jehovah's Witnesses to becoming one.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.890
In a new episode of Where Are They Now, Jim shares how he is legally defending Jehovah's

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.890
Name.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:36.329
Years ago, hundreds of young brothers in South Africa were imprisoned for their neutrality.

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.090
What risks did they take to feed themselves spiritually?

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.689
And our music video portrays the higher kind of love that we express through our brotherhood.

00:00:47.689 --> 00:01:09.739
This is JW Broadcasting.

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:11.700
What do you think?

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.859
Is it possible for an imperfect human to elevate his or her thinking to agree with God?

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:19.739
God's thinking?

00:01:19.739 --> 00:01:23.579
And if so, how can we do this?

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:29.980
To answer those questions, let's consider several verses in the Bible book of Isaiah.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:38.700
First, let's read Isaiah chapter 40 verses 12 through 14.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.739
Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand?

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:49.379
And taken the measurements of the heavens with the span of his hand?

00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:52.579
Who has gathered and a measure the dust of the earth?

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.060
Or weighed the mountains in the balances?

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.780
And the hills in the scale?

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.219
Who has taken the measurements of the spirit of Jehovah?

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:12.259
And who can instruct him as his advisor, with whom did he consult to gain understanding?

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:16.620
Or who teaches him in the path of justice?

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:23.460
Or teaches him knowledge, or shows him the way of true understanding?

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.300
What do we learn from these verses?

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:35.939
That Jehovah's thinking, his wisdom, his understanding of the earth's physical makeup and processes,

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:42.979
and his intimate knowledge of each one of us imperfect humans is elevated.

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:48.379
So much so that it may seem far beyond our reach.

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:55.939
But the good news is that Jehovah is not inaccessible, and neither is his thinking.

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:57.860
How do we know?

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.780
We know because of a beautiful Bible prophecy found in Isaiah.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.819
In fulfillment of this prophecy, Jehovah is drawing millions of imperfect humans to himself,

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.900
and in the process he's elevating us and our thinking.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:24.139
Please follow along as I read Isaiah chapter 2, verses 2 and 3.

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:31.340
As we read and discuss the verses, you'll see that Isaiah paints a simple but vivid prophetic

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.139
picture.

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:40.500
In the final part of the day, or as the footnote helps us to appreciate, in the last days,

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.780
that is, in these days, the time in which you and I are living.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.099
In the final part of the days, the mountain of the house of Jehovah will become firmly

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:57.699
established above the top of the mountains, and it will be raised up above the hills,

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:02.650
and to it all the nations will stream.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.930
What does the mountain of the house of Jehovah represent?

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.650
Pure worship.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:15.569
In other words, in the last days, pure worship would become prominent, plainly evident, and

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.689
available for all who are seeking the truth.

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:25.370
The prophecy indicates that honest-hearted people from all of the nations would climb

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.089
the mountain of pure worship.

00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:30.129
Why would they do so?

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:33.689
Verse 3 continues.

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:40.569
Many people will go and say, come, let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah to the house

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:42.610
of the God of Jacob.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:50.850
He will instruct us about his ways, and we will walk in his paths.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:59.129
For law, or as the footnote helps us to appreciate, instruction for law or instruction will go

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:04.410
out of Zion and the word of Jehovah out of Jerusalem.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:11.529
So, in the last days, we are told that people from all of the nations would go to the mountain

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:18.250
of pure worship in order to be instructed by Jehovah.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.170
Did you notice the expression of determination made by these ones?

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.449
We will walk in his paths.

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:29.689
What a beautiful prophecy.

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:32.370
But how does this relate to our question?

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.569
What does it have to do with elevating our thinking to agree with God's thinking?

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:41.730
Well, what happens when you climb a mountain?

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:48.449
It takes effort, it can be tiring, you may stumble, you may even suffer some injury while

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:56.850
you claw at, but if you persevere, what's the situation when you get to the top?

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:01.970
Or elevated, you have a view that you would never have experienced if you hadn't made

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.569
the claw hunt.

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:08.050
The reward makes it worth the effort.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:13.449
In a spiritual sense, that's true of Jehovah's elevated worship.

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:19.170
If we're willing to put forth the effort to make the claw hunt, that is, to learn Jehovah's

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:25.050
standards and apply them in our lives, pure worship elevates us.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.529
Why?

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:30.730
Because Jehovah's laws and principles are elevated.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:36.930
If we cultivate a love for Jehovah's standards, our thinking becomes elevated.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:42.410
We begin to think more in harmony with Jehovah's thoughts.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:47.209
Typical is the experience of one young person who wrote,

00:06:47.209 --> 00:06:51.569
I lived a life of immorality and drunkenness.

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:54.009
I had sexual diseases.

00:06:54.009 --> 00:07:02.050
I also sold drugs and just didn't care about anything.

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:06.689
As this young person studied the Bible, climbed the mountain.

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:11.170
She made changes in order to conform to God's standards.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:15.970
As a result, she was elevated by pure worship.

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:26.250
Now she says, I enjoy peace of mind, self-respect, a hope for the future, a real family, and best

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:31.769
of all a relationship with our father, Jehovah.

00:07:31.769 --> 00:07:38.689
Yes, by climbing the mountain of pure worship, she elevated her thinking to agree with God's

00:07:38.689 --> 00:07:45.290
thinking, and in the process, she has been elevated by pure worship.

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.970
What have we learned so far?

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:53.490
That it is possible to elevate our thinking to agree with God's thinking.

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:57.649
We do that by climbing the mountain of pure worship.

00:07:57.649 --> 00:08:03.089
Of course, the mountain of pure worship is what elevates us.

00:08:03.089 --> 00:08:06.569
We're not elevated on our own merit.

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:10.129
Jehovah blesses our effort to make the client.

00:08:10.129 --> 00:08:16.769
Remembering that helps us to be humble as we lovingly assist others who are also climbing

00:08:16.769 --> 00:08:19.170
the mountain.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.649
One more reminder.

00:08:21.649 --> 00:08:29.089
If we abandon Jehovah's standards, we quickly lose our elevated standing and perspective,

00:08:29.089 --> 00:08:35.610
so it's important to hold tightly to Jehovah's elevated way of doing things, even when

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:39.529
it's not easy to do so.

00:08:39.529 --> 00:08:46.090
But what if we do make a serious mistake or become involved in serious wrongdoing?

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:47.929
We lose altitude.

00:08:47.929 --> 00:08:52.129
It's like a free fall at the time.

00:08:52.129 --> 00:08:57.009
Perhaps when you first heard the theme of this discussion, another verse in Isaiah came

00:08:57.009 --> 00:08:58.850
to your maud.

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:04.169
Let's read Isaiah chapter 55, verse 9.

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:22.500
So Jehovah tells us forth rightly that his thoughts are higher than our thoughts.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:26.460
What's the context of Jehovah's words?

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:33.179
Please notice the verses that proceed, verse 9, beginning in verse 7.

00:09:33.179 --> 00:09:38.980
Let the wicked man leave his way and the evil man his thoughts.

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:46.059
Let him return to Jehovah who will have mercy on him to our God, for he will forgive

00:09:46.059 --> 00:09:48.460
in a large way.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:56.820
For my thoughts are not your thoughts and your ways are not my ways to clear Jehovah.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:02.340
For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so my ways are higher than your ways and

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:06.299
my thoughts than your thoughts.

00:10:06.299 --> 00:10:14.100
When Jehovah says that his thoughts are higher than our thoughts, he is talking about forgiveness.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:18.580
He forgives repentant wrongdoers in a large way.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:24.899
Truly, Jehovah's mercy is on a level that's challenging for us to comprehend.

00:10:24.899 --> 00:10:31.539
After all, when we forgive a fellow human, it's a case of one sinner for giving another.

00:10:31.539 --> 00:10:38.740
All of us realize that sooner or later we will need to have a fellow human forgive us.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:46.139
But Jehovah, even though he never needs to be forgiven, forgives in a large way.

00:10:46.139 --> 00:10:52.220
And in his mercy, Jehovah opens the floodgates of the heavens, showering down blessings

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:56.659
on those who return to him with all their heart.

00:10:56.659 --> 00:11:01.779
That's the elevated view that you and I strive to imitate.

00:11:01.779 --> 00:11:08.179
The August 2024 study edition of The Watchtower helped us to better appreciate Jehovah's

00:11:08.179 --> 00:11:16.379
elevated thinking as reflected in his mercy and his willingness to forgive repentant wrongdoers,

00:11:16.379 --> 00:11:20.460
even those who have committed serious sins.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:26.419
For example, we discussed the case of the unrepentant wrongdoer in the congregation and

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:28.179
Carth.

00:11:28.179 --> 00:11:35.259
His sinful course was so shocking that Paul said it was not even found among the nations.

00:11:35.259 --> 00:11:41.299
Truly, this Christian man had abandoned Jehovah's elevated standards.

00:11:41.299 --> 00:11:48.299
Because he was unrepentant, Paul instructed the elders to remove the man from the congregation.

00:11:48.299 --> 00:11:55.259
And yet, perhaps only months later, Paul instructed the elders to kindly forgive and

00:11:55.259 --> 00:11:59.580
comfort the man to confirm their love for him.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.460
Why?

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:07.580
The discipline had yielded positive results, the man repented, and was welcomed back into

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:12.220
the congregation as a brother.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:18.179
What good news, what a beautiful example of Jehovah's elevated thinking, and it serves

00:12:18.179 --> 00:12:24.419
to assure any Christian who's fallen into serious wrongdoing, that it is possible

00:12:24.419 --> 00:12:30.860
with Jehovah's help to get up, dust yourself off, and continue climbing the mountain of pure

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:33.500
worship.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:40.779
And yet, the watchtower, frankly, acknowledged that some in the congregation may have been

00:12:40.779 --> 00:12:44.259
reluctant to display a welcoming spirit.

00:12:44.259 --> 00:12:46.659
Why?

00:12:46.659 --> 00:12:52.179
Just like the older brother in Jesus' illustration of the lost son at Luke chapter 15,

00:12:52.179 --> 00:12:59.139
verses 28 through 30, some faithful ones in the congregation may have felt resentment

00:12:59.139 --> 00:13:01.659
toward the wrongdoer.

00:13:01.659 --> 00:13:04.059
It's no different today.

00:13:04.059 --> 00:13:09.659
When the elders determine that a repentant wrongdoer is allowed to remain in the congregation,

00:13:09.659 --> 00:13:16.379
or one is reinstated back into the congregation, we might find it challenging to display a

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:19.019
welcoming spirit.

00:13:19.019 --> 00:13:26.500
Especially if we were personally affected in some way by the wrongdoing.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:32.019
In such a case, we could feel that we've been forgotten, that our personal feelings

00:13:32.019 --> 00:13:38.620
are being ignored, or that Jehovah doesn't care about the damage inflicted by the repentant

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.700
wrongdoer.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:45.700
We could even feel that Jehovah has failed us.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:50.500
Luke can help us to have Jehovah's elevated view.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.259
Consider a Bible example.

00:13:53.259 --> 00:13:59.899
King David committed a serious sin when he took Bathsheba, the wife of Euryah.

00:13:59.899 --> 00:14:06.059
Not only did he commit adultery, stealing the wife of another man, but he compounded

00:14:06.059 --> 00:14:14.700
his sin by arranging for the death of Euryah, adultery, and murder.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:19.580
Of course, Jehovah saw the whole ugly scene unfold.

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.259
How would he deal with David?

00:14:22.259 --> 00:14:25.220
He arranged for Nathan to confront David.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:30.220
Nathan used a powerful illustration that touched David's heart.

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.980
As a result, David repented.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.899
How did Jehovah respond?

00:14:36.899 --> 00:14:41.539
Rather than imposing the death penalty called for by the Mosaic Law.

00:14:41.539 --> 00:14:48.919
This is what said at 2 Samuel 12, verse 13.

00:14:48.919 --> 00:14:55.679
David then said to Nathan, I have sinned against Jehovah.

00:14:55.679 --> 00:15:01.679
Nathan replied to David, Jehovah in turn forgives your sin.

00:15:01.679 --> 00:15:05.490
You will not die.

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:09.129
Jehovah mercifully allowed David to live.

00:15:09.129 --> 00:15:12.769
David continued to rule as king.

00:15:12.769 --> 00:15:15.169
What about the victim?

00:15:15.169 --> 00:15:17.809
What about Euryah?

00:15:17.809 --> 00:15:20.730
Did Jehovah forget Euryah?

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:24.049
Please follow along as I read two verses.

00:15:24.049 --> 00:15:29.889
The first is 1 Kings 15, verse 5.

00:15:29.889 --> 00:15:37.049
For David did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, and he did not turn aside from anything

00:15:37.049 --> 00:15:42.090
that he had commanded him all the days of his life.

00:15:43.049 --> 00:15:48.049
In the matter of Euryah, the Hittite.

00:15:48.049 --> 00:15:53.409
The second verse is Matthew 1, verse 6.

00:15:53.409 --> 00:15:56.570
Jesse became father to David the king.

00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:03.409
David became father to Solomon by the wife of Euryah.

00:16:03.409 --> 00:16:05.649
What's the point?

00:16:05.649 --> 00:16:08.250
Did Jehovah forgive David?

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:09.850
Yes.

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:14.289
But Jehovah has never forgotten Euryah.

00:16:14.289 --> 00:16:21.049
In the new world, Jehovah will execute perfect justice when he resurrects Euryah.

00:16:21.049 --> 00:16:27.129
And how we all look forward to being there to welcome him.

00:16:27.129 --> 00:16:30.450
What do we learn from this example?

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:35.090
We need to elevate our thinking to agree with God's.

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:41.049
Like Jehovah, we can experience the joy of giving by forgiving.

00:16:41.049 --> 00:16:46.250
It's one of the most beautiful forms of giving there is.

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:53.690
We're confident that Jehovah and his infinite wisdom will undo any damage, physical, emotional

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:55.970
and spiritual.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:17:03.250
We believe the wonderful promise at Isaiah chapter 65, verse 17.

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:08.289
For look, I am creating new heavens and a new earth.

00:17:08.289 --> 00:17:15.490
And the former things will not be called to my heart nor will they come up into the heart.

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:22.769
That day is fast approaching when any pain, including painful memories that we've experienced,

00:17:22.769 --> 00:17:26.569
will be completely undone.

00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:30.849
Such experiences will not even be called to my heart.

00:17:30.849 --> 00:17:35.049
What a blessed day that will be.

00:17:35.049 --> 00:17:36.930
Can you see it?

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:38.450
Keep climbing.

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:39.930
Don't give up.

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:43.569
Remember, we have eternity in Vuhu.

00:17:43.569 --> 00:17:52.450
And it's a view we will never experience if we don't climb the mountain of pure worship.

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:59.529
Jim McCabe's search for pure worship was unfulfilled until he accepted a Bible study

00:17:59.529 --> 00:18:02.130
and came into the truth.

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:09.569
Today, his work in defending Jehovah's name proves to him that Jehovah will always support

00:18:09.569 --> 00:18:10.569
his people.

00:18:10.569 --> 00:18:17.779
Well, from the very beginning, when we started studying together, we were putting Jehovah

00:18:17.779 --> 00:18:18.859
to the test.

00:18:18.859 --> 00:18:23.180
But in reality, I think as we look back, we see Jehovah's testing us.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.500
How much did we love Him?

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:26.940
How much did we want to serve Him?

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:31.500
If I hadn't put King Dementia's first, if I hadn't looked at Jehovah to take care of

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.579
us, I wouldn't have had any of these experiences.

00:18:34.579 --> 00:18:37.299
Jehovah's hand is with his people.

00:18:37.299 --> 00:18:40.220
In the legal field, we see it every day of our lives.

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:51.220
Well, I grew up in a big family of eight children.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:53.220
My parents really valued education.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:57.259
So I moved to San Diego and started attending law school.

00:18:57.259 --> 00:19:02.140
That's the year that I met Melinda and we started dating.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:06.539
By that time, we weren't really practicing Catholics.

00:19:06.539 --> 00:19:09.339
We hadn't been given any reason to have faith.

00:19:10.339 --> 00:19:14.140
That was one thing that really attracted us about the truth is we could see reasons

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:17.980
and see facts and evidence that built up a faith.

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:22.259
Jesus said, if you put the King Dementia's first, everything else will be taken care of.

00:19:22.259 --> 00:19:24.019
Jehovah will take care of what you need.

00:19:24.019 --> 00:19:28.019
I basically became a part-time lawyer and a full-time preacher.

00:19:28.019 --> 00:19:35.450
We believed the promise and our lives became very much happier as a result.

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:40.930
We go out to ministry first and do other things later and even as our family grew.

00:19:41.369 --> 00:19:44.849
That was kind of the way we raised them.

00:19:44.849 --> 00:19:49.849
We worked with people who were fun people who really took an interest in our children.

00:19:49.849 --> 00:19:54.769
We feel like we had several pioneer couple of friends who helped raise our children.

00:19:54.769 --> 00:20:00.089
So our friends became their friends.

00:20:00.089 --> 00:20:05.450
During the 1984-85, a letter went out to all congregations in the United States

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:07.849
asking if you could come to Bethel.

00:20:07.849 --> 00:20:11.170
So we were so happy Jim got accepted to do construction.

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:15.130
But then of course the washier broke, everything seemed to happen at the same time.

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:20.170
Somehow again, Matthew 633 put the kingdom first.

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:23.089
Jehovah really, really took care of us.

00:20:23.089 --> 00:20:25.170
I went to go out a two-week assignment.

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:30.490
The third day I was given a call from the brother who was the overseer for construction.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:35.690
He'll Nazarov and he said, you've been reassigned to the legal department.

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:39.730
After Jim had done a number of temporary stints at Bethel,

00:20:39.769 --> 00:20:42.170
we were invited to go for two weeks.

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:43.970
So we went with the boys.

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:45.849
We had such a good time.

00:20:45.849 --> 00:20:48.930
After that, they started talking to me seriously.

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:55.089
Do you think you and your family could move to New York to live at Bethel and to work full time for us?

00:20:55.089 --> 00:21:00.529
Shortly after arriving at Bethel, I was assigned to do some work overseas.

00:21:00.529 --> 00:21:04.369
And Melinda was home with three boys.

00:21:04.369 --> 00:21:07.369
It was something that was very difficult for me.

00:21:07.369 --> 00:21:13.569
It was a challenge because in those days Brooklyn was really a third world country to us, Southern California residents.

00:21:13.569 --> 00:21:19.569
But the blessings that have come as a result far outweigh any of the sacrifice.

00:21:19.569 --> 00:21:26.369
Our oldest son was assigned to the factory at 16 and Jesse and Ryan, our other two sons,

00:21:26.369 --> 00:21:29.930
worked with me in the laundry in the morning and then went to school.

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:33.089
And I think that's how to profound influence on our sons.

00:21:33.089 --> 00:21:42.019
Bethelites, 19, 20-year-old Bethelites that associated with them and I think they've really enjoyed the blessings.

00:21:42.019 --> 00:21:48.220
Eventually, we moved back to California, but I still work closely with the legal department.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:52.019
One of the countries I worked with overseas was France.

00:21:52.019 --> 00:22:03.539
In 1998, the government there decided to impose a 60% tax on all the donations the branch received between the years 1993 to 1996.

00:22:03.539 --> 00:22:11.059
Soon after, they added a penalty to the tax making the entire amount 108% of the donations received.

00:22:11.059 --> 00:22:13.180
No organization could pay that.

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.299
So we began litigating them.

00:22:15.299 --> 00:22:22.299
At this point in time, our expert did not want to put Bible scriptures and tell the story of Jehovah's Witnesses who we are.

00:22:22.299 --> 00:22:23.619
And that's why we litigate.

00:22:23.619 --> 00:22:30.859
We don't litigate just to win cases, but we litigate as Jesus said in Matthew 10, 18 to make it turn out to be a witness.

00:22:30.859 --> 00:22:33.619
So we had to put this in the brief.

00:22:33.619 --> 00:22:40.740
He consented to put it in in 2011 when we won the case before the European Court of Human Rights.

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:46.059
The victory was on a violation of Jehovah's Witnesses' freedom of religion.

00:22:46.059 --> 00:22:49.660
Jehovah won on the exact point he wanted, freedom of religion.

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:55.240
We knew it was Jehovah's Victory. It wasn't our victory.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:23:00.039
Putting King Dimitris first has changed everything about our lives.

00:23:00.039 --> 00:23:08.000
But I think to me, as a mother, the most important thing is that our sons, their wonderful wives and their children are all serving Jehovah.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.440
And it's because they too put the kingdom first.

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.440
We're not a perfect family by any means.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:23.319
But the blessings have been too numerous to even comprehend for us.

00:23:23.319 --> 00:23:38.849
Jehovah has kept all his promises.

00:23:38.849 --> 00:23:49.730
If you want to do more for Jehovah, but are unsure how, consider reading Jim's life story in the February 8, 1987 issue of awake.

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:57.329
In it, you'll learn how putting Jehovah to the test often leads to blessings.

00:23:57.329 --> 00:24:01.089
One blessing we all experience is our Christian meetings.

00:24:01.089 --> 00:24:03.809
They are essential.

00:24:03.809 --> 00:24:13.170
But for hundreds of young South African brothers in the 1970s and 1980s, this lifeline was taken away.

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:14.650
Or was it?

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:21.009
What risk did they take to fill their spiritual needs?

00:24:21.009 --> 00:24:27.970
In the 1960s, South Africa started to become increasingly involved in military conflicts in neighboring countries.

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:31.650
As a result, many of our young brothers were drafted for military service,

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:36.329
but because of their neutrality, the brothers were sent to prison.

00:24:36.329 --> 00:24:43.009
Initially, when the brothers were sentenced to military prison, they were required to wear the army uniform,

00:24:43.009 --> 00:24:45.210
which, of course, they refused to do.

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:52.849
The brothers felt that dressing in those clothes would identify them with the military prisoners and they took a stand on that.

00:24:52.849 --> 00:24:57.609
They wore blue overalls and hence became known as the blue boys.

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:01.890
Everyone knew the blue boys were Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:06.890
In the early days, the brothers served their entire sentence, locked up in individual cells,

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:11.009
and that meant it very difficult for them to be able to meet together for worship.

00:25:11.009 --> 00:25:14.289
One of the brothers who served during those days was David Caracas.

00:25:14.289 --> 00:25:19.410
Just recently, David and I got together and we talked about some of our experiences in prison.

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:23.529
When I got into prison, we were not allowed to communicate at all.

00:25:23.529 --> 00:25:26.769
We were strictly speaking in solitary confinement.

00:25:26.809 --> 00:25:30.250
Their aim was to break the witnesses they said as much.

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:38.730
There were 64 cells, 32 on each side, and we used to purchase cells up on the bars above the door.

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:44.490
They made little mini hammock, as it were, and when everything was locked up and quiet,

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:47.289
then we would have the meetings.

00:25:47.289 --> 00:25:49.730
We had a whole spiritual program.

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:53.329
We had a public talk, the Theocratic Ministry School,

00:25:53.369 --> 00:25:58.210
and we had to contact the meeting just audibly enough to hear each other.

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:03.769
The brothers who went to prison in the 10 years or so before I went in had a big impact.

00:26:03.769 --> 00:26:06.130
They laid the track as it were.

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:09.130
These brothers came out of prison with their faith strong,

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:13.289
they had a joyful countenance, and that was really inspiring.

00:26:13.289 --> 00:26:17.450
As younger brothers like myself, we're preparing for our time in prison.

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:21.009
Things were a little different when I was in there.

00:26:21.009 --> 00:26:26.049
We were in the prison blocks, but on the weekends, we were not locked up.

00:26:26.049 --> 00:26:32.490
They left us alone, and so we'd bring our chairs or upturned buckets and sit in groups,

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:36.569
and we could have, most of our meetings that way, including the songs.

00:26:36.569 --> 00:26:40.049
Some of the brothers had made their own musical instruments,

00:26:40.049 --> 00:26:43.690
so the army was used to the idea of us singing various songs,

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:46.289
and so it didn't create as much attention.

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:52.809
Jeep of the足, run, he's my shepherd.

00:26:53.930 --> 00:27:02.339
Also, if we were careful enough on a weekend,

00:27:02.339 --> 00:27:07.539
we could bring in the materials for circuit assemblies and district conventions.

00:27:07.539 --> 00:27:09.819
And have our conventions.

00:27:09.819 --> 00:27:15.579
One of these pictures shows the brothers' costumes for dramas.

00:27:15.579 --> 00:27:18.059
We'd have those at 6 o'clock in the morning

00:27:18.059 --> 00:27:21.900
so that there was much less opportunity of being discovered.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:26.700
The brothers loved that because they were able to really get into the spirit of the dramas.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:30.259
That especially, we didn't want the corporals to see.

00:27:30.259 --> 00:27:37.740
Amazing idea over kept a flow of spiritual food even going in behind prison walls.

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:42.779
Our meetings were very important, whether they were approved by the authorities or not.

00:27:42.779 --> 00:27:45.299
This is one thing we would not let go.

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:49.539
The source of our strength was the spiritual food we had,

00:27:49.539 --> 00:27:53.299
and the brotherly love that existed in the encouragement,

00:27:53.299 --> 00:27:57.099
so the brothers made every effort to keep the meetings going.

00:27:57.099 --> 00:28:01.059
And a good example of that was the memorial.

00:28:01.059 --> 00:28:04.339
When I got into prison, we were asking the authorities,

00:28:04.339 --> 00:28:06.900
please let us have the memorial.

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:10.980
And the answer was a definite no.

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:14.660
So we were ready to do it on our own, but we kept asking.

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:18.579
And eventually on the memorial day, that Tuesday afternoon,

00:28:18.579 --> 00:28:22.259
suddenly they let us all out of ourselves, let us go and shower.

00:28:22.259 --> 00:28:25.380
We weren't allowed to use the showers normally.

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:28.619
And they said, get dressed for your service tonight.

00:28:28.619 --> 00:28:29.619
Ready.

00:28:29.619 --> 00:28:33.940
And about seven o'clock we had the memorial in the little chapel there.

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:39.859
When we started singing the song in that little chapel, about 125 of us,

00:28:39.859 --> 00:28:42.500
the volume was deafening.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.140
And there was hardly a dry eye in the audience.

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:47.019
After the memorial, we got out.

00:28:47.019 --> 00:28:50.380
I still remember the full moon rising in the East,

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:53.900
the over the military headquarters of South Africa.

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:58.059
And it was like a victory if it's Jehovah's will for us to have the memorial.

00:28:58.059 --> 00:29:00.220
Nobody's going to stop it.

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:04.099
But it was the most memorable memorial of my life.

00:29:04.099 --> 00:29:05.940
I can just imagine.

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:09.940
Meeting together in prison, as we did, made me realize that

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:15.660
the privilege of meeting together is not our gift to Jehovah as much as his gift to us.

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:16.660
Yes, yes.

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:19.500
And it really binds you together in a very special way.

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:20.779
It does.

00:29:20.779 --> 00:29:22.980
We really need the meetings.

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:25.380
We need that spiritual strength.

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:30.700
Meeting attendants, I think especially since their time has become a treasured gift.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:35.779
We don't easily want to miss our meetings and certainly to be there in person if we can.

00:29:35.819 --> 00:29:39.980
Hearing other brothers express their faith and giving you an opportunity

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:46.619
to express your faith is a great source of encouragement, vital source.

00:29:46.619 --> 00:29:50.099
It's not just a group of people who are learning the same thing.

00:29:50.099 --> 00:29:51.619
This is a spiritual family.

00:29:51.619 --> 00:29:55.859
And Jehovah knows that we need to draw together and encourage one another personally,

00:29:55.859 --> 00:30:04.940
particularly, as Paul said, as the day draws near.

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:10.740
Let's take Brother Martin's advice and fully embrace our Christian meetings.

00:30:10.779 --> 00:30:16.180
They really do encourage us as the day draws near.

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:18.940
But meetings do even more.

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:26.299
They prepare us for persecution by elevating our thinking to agree with God's.

00:30:26.299 --> 00:30:34.660
If the thought of persecution makes you anxious, rest assured, you can stay faithful.

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:44.109
You'll have Jehovah's Holy Spirit and loving care just as Leo liangued it.

00:30:44.109 --> 00:30:48.109
In 1958, there was pounding on the door.

00:30:48.109 --> 00:30:51.710
So I opened up the place where pistols came in.

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:55.900
They put the cups on me right away.

00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:09.420
Because of the opposition from the government, the preaching work became harder and harder.

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:13.460
We prepared our minds and hearts to be arrested.

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.220
How did the person recall scripture as well?

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:19.420
If you copy and copy it's more in your brain.

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:26.460
So with the help of the Holy Spirit, you could recall what you learned.

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:30.059
So the very day I was arrested, I printed Jehovah gone.

00:31:30.059 --> 00:31:33.539
I will die faithful to you until death.

00:31:33.539 --> 00:31:40.710
I knew that if I am in for the truth, Jehovah will protect me.

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:43.990
My case never went to trial.

00:31:44.029 --> 00:31:47.869
I never got a caught caring.

00:31:47.869 --> 00:31:50.630
We had the worst kind of food in prison.

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:56.109
They fed us ransom rice, 50% rice, 50% water.

00:31:56.109 --> 00:31:59.230
First of all, days in prison, you can't eat it.

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:05.180
It was terrible, but after sometime you're hungry, you can eat it.

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:08.299
We had a sleep like sardines in the cell.

00:32:08.299 --> 00:32:12.680
And five people had a sleep in it.

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:16.920
I was transferred to the art department.

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:20.880
It's freer than locked up in the cell the whole day.

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:24.849
And it helped me to survive.

00:32:24.849 --> 00:32:27.609
I compiled my own daily texts in jail.

00:32:27.609 --> 00:32:33.609
Every day I'll concentrate on one text, not to lose out on my spirituality.

00:32:33.609 --> 00:32:39.170
I had about 20 scriptures that I went over and over again,

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:40.569
but I needed more scriptures.

00:32:40.569 --> 00:32:42.329
So I printed Jehovah God.

00:32:42.329 --> 00:32:47.170
I said, please give me more scriptures if possible.

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:54.210
In the center of the jail, there was a huge pile of books, magazines, photos.

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:56.809
I looked, wow, a Chinese book.

00:32:56.809 --> 00:32:58.690
That's answering my prayer.

00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:01.609
I need that.

00:33:01.609 --> 00:33:03.849
But there were four policemen on God there.

00:33:03.849 --> 00:33:09.410
I printed Jehovah God and let them go to lunch and leave this place alone.

00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:11.410
The 1215 I went back.

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:14.730
I looked around, no more policemen, they went to lunch.

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:19.009
Make sure that nobody's hiding in the windows.

00:33:19.009 --> 00:33:21.089
So I took the big risks.

00:33:21.089 --> 00:33:27.450
I grabbed what I could, stuffed my shirt, and thanked Jehovah God.

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:30.490
They took more scriptures.

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:34.650
I took it out, wow, the complete works of Paul.

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:36.569
Jehovah God blessed me with that.

00:33:36.569 --> 00:33:38.769
So I prayed to Jehovah God again.

00:33:38.769 --> 00:33:40.970
Hi, am I going to keep it?

00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:43.930
In jail, since there's nobody to talk to,

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:48.490
you've talked to Jehovah God all the time, and you get closer and closer to Him.

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:51.809
He gives you an answer in time.

00:33:51.809 --> 00:33:58.069
So the answer was write it down on cloth.

00:33:58.069 --> 00:34:01.829
I cut the white sheets into a size of a letter paper.

00:34:01.829 --> 00:34:08.750
And when the four of the people in my cell saw sleeping, I was just copying it.

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:14.429
The God was making his rounds, and he stopped at my door.

00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:18.269
I kept on copying right under his nose.

00:34:18.269 --> 00:34:22.869
On the outside of the cell has all the five people's names there.

00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:27.829
So he looked, oh, Leo Lang, he's the supervisor of the God Department.

00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:29.829
He must be working overtime.

00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:32.349
Oh, very good, very good.

00:34:32.349 --> 00:34:37.619
I just copied right in front of him.

00:34:37.619 --> 00:34:44.500
In prison, this one scripture helped me a lot, first Peter by seven, while you throw

00:34:44.539 --> 00:34:51.980
all your anxiety on him that's on Jehovah, because he cares for you.

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:55.539
At first, I still have anxiety.

00:34:55.539 --> 00:34:59.340
I'm 40% gone, but I still have 60%.

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:01.780
Okay, I pray again.

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:05.019
Next month is 50%.

00:35:05.019 --> 00:35:08.860
Next month, 40%, 30%.

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:16.539
Then I knew when it's 0%, I stopped worrying over anything.

00:35:16.539 --> 00:35:22.900
Took me one whole year to digest this, and I didn't have any anxiety.

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:30.980
But if you make an effort to do so, it could be accomplished.

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:34.539
I reached to this artist who just sat across me.

00:35:34.539 --> 00:35:38.900
He said, when he goes out up 20 years, he's going to kill this one, kill that one, kill

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:39.900
this one.

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:42.139
I said, do you know what the Bible says?

00:35:42.139 --> 00:35:47.980
If Bible says, you've got to pray for those that persecute you.

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:51.139
But in the end, he saw me out.

00:35:51.139 --> 00:35:55.820
The policeman asked him, you sitting across Leo, what are you talking about?

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.059
Oh, he's preaching to me.

00:35:58.059 --> 00:36:01.619
But he came back after saying that and bowed down to me.

00:36:01.619 --> 00:36:05.980
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Leo, forgive me, forgive me.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:07.780
The chief of prison called me there.

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:09.820
He said, you broke the rules.

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:15.099
I said, yes, but if you knew what I preached to, you'd be happy.

00:36:15.099 --> 00:36:17.500
You want to know what I preached to him?

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:20.980
Yes, so I told him, you're preaching to me now.

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:22.699
No, no, no, no, I'm not preaching to you.

00:36:22.699 --> 00:36:26.820
I'm confessing to you what I preached to him, but the same thing, right?

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:28.739
I'm confessing to you.

00:36:28.739 --> 00:36:43.139
And then I said, I'm preaching Christian love to them, not to hate you.

00:36:43.139 --> 00:36:47.980
Since I did such a good work in prison to Captain Tomi,

00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:53.940
it would be better for me to be transferred to the labor camp

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:56.460
than to be released in the city.

00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:03.300
They could kill me anytime, because I was declared an enemy of the state.

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:05.340
So we arrived in the camp.

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:09.019
Besides this tea, we planted wheat, we planted rice.

00:37:09.019 --> 00:37:13.099
I have to bend down 16 hours to cut the thing,

00:37:13.099 --> 00:37:16.659
and then I have to bind it with a box.

00:37:16.659 --> 00:37:19.820
After one day, my hands are all bloody.

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:26.539
The next day, it's worse because it hurts now.

00:37:26.539 --> 00:37:29.460
Everyday I'll pray in the camp.

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:35.460
You can see millions of stars, wow, beautiful there.

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:41.300
I prayed all the time to Jehovah, to give me the wisdom,

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:45.260
the courage, and the strength to carry on.

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:48.420
So after six years, I prayed to Jehovah God.

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:52.940
I said, next seventh year, I will not be able to make it.

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:59.980
Remember me in a new system.

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:05.539
I was released after 21 and a half years, 15 years in prison,

00:38:05.539 --> 00:38:14.260
six and a half years in the camp, all thanks to Jehovah God.

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:17.099
We served Jehovah in good times.

00:38:17.099 --> 00:38:20.260
We served Jehovah in hard times.

00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:26.019
And we were served Jehovah in very difficult times.

00:38:26.019 --> 00:38:31.659
Jehovah God prepares us in advance for the Great Tribulation.

00:38:31.659 --> 00:38:33.460
I never possible that.

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:35.699
So it'll be a hot for me also.

00:38:35.699 --> 00:38:39.579
But I know what Jehovah's help, what Jehovah's Holy Spirit.

00:38:39.579 --> 00:38:42.579
I will be able to make it you, be able to make it everybody.

00:38:42.579 --> 00:38:49.690
It will make it if we depend on Jehovah 100%.

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:53.610
Wouldn't you agree that Brother Liang was not diminished?

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:56.409
Rather, he was elevated.

00:38:56.409 --> 00:39:02.130
Leo's experience stresses the importance of relying on Jehovah now

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:07.530
so that we can fully trust him in more difficult times.

00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:11.969
The prophet Amos was an excellent example of someone

00:39:11.969 --> 00:39:15.050
who fully relied on Jehovah.

00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:18.409
As we dig for treasures in the book of Amos,

00:39:18.409 --> 00:39:22.929
consider how he boldly proclaimed Jehovah's message of judgment

00:39:22.929 --> 00:39:31.869
against those who mistreated others.

00:39:31.869 --> 00:39:35.829
There's so much to explore for family worship in the book of Amos, isn't there?

00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:37.190
Yes, there is.

00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:42.190
To see Jehovah discern the potential in such a humble, hardworking shepherd

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:45.789
and then entrust him to boldly preach a vital message,

00:39:45.789 --> 00:39:48.110
it's such a fascinating account.

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:50.230
But there's so much more to the book of Amos.

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:53.469
It's filled to the brim with treasures about Jehovah.

00:39:53.469 --> 00:39:55.389
Yeah, I can't wait to dive in.

00:39:55.389 --> 00:39:56.710
Where should we start?

00:39:56.710 --> 00:40:00.710
I came across a 2019 watchtower that has a great framework

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:02.869
for digging into the prophets.

00:40:02.869 --> 00:40:04.110
Great tip.

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:06.110
Yes, it talked about developing our interests

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:07.750
in what the prophet wrote.

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:10.829
He gave a number of great questions to ask.

00:40:10.829 --> 00:40:14.550
And then it also mentioned looking for what attitude or practices

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:16.030
Jehovah was looking to correct.

00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:17.510
That's right.

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:18.550
So let's think about it.

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:21.869
Jehovah sends Amos to the northern 10 tribe kingdom,

00:40:21.869 --> 00:40:24.190
and he begins by pronouncing judgment

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:27.110
against surrounding enemy nations like Syria,

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:30.269
Felicia, Edom, and others.

00:40:30.269 --> 00:40:32.590
Looking at the map, I would imagine at first

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:35.429
the Israelites really liked where the message was headed.

00:40:35.429 --> 00:40:38.429
But I wonder at what point they began

00:40:38.429 --> 00:40:41.789
to realize that message was getting closer to home.

00:40:41.789 --> 00:40:44.389
And not just close, bullseye.

00:40:44.389 --> 00:40:47.389
Amos' message was meant for them the whole time,

00:40:47.429 --> 00:40:49.989
but it's the why that's so outstanding.

00:40:49.989 --> 00:40:51.670
Because of their false worship

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:54.869
and because they were mistreating people.

00:40:54.869 --> 00:40:57.269
You know, there was a word that kept coming up

00:40:57.269 --> 00:40:59.469
in those two opening chapters.

00:40:59.469 --> 00:41:01.510
The word because.

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:04.909
So to help me keep track, I took a brief note.

00:41:04.909 --> 00:41:07.510
Yeah, you know, I like taking some notes by hand too.

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:10.469
Yeah, and even though I usually take them electronically,

00:41:10.469 --> 00:41:13.309
I find taking some notes by hand

00:41:13.309 --> 00:41:15.349
makes a deeper mental impression

00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:16.710
and helps me remember.

00:41:16.789 --> 00:41:17.789
Yes.

00:41:17.789 --> 00:41:20.949
So in this case, Jehovah was going to crush

00:41:20.949 --> 00:41:23.469
all these surrounding nations, including Israel.

00:41:23.469 --> 00:41:27.710
Because, among other things, they handed over exiles,

00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:29.750
didn't remember the covenant of brothers,

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:31.469
pursued their brother with the sword,

00:41:31.469 --> 00:41:34.989
refused to show mercy, ripped open pregnant women,

00:41:34.989 --> 00:41:38.349
sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for sandals.

00:41:38.349 --> 00:41:41.469
In other words, they were mistreating people.

00:41:41.469 --> 00:41:43.550
So there's an attitude in practice

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:45.510
that Jehovah wanted to correct.

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:47.670
Mistreatment of people.

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:51.269
Doesn't that say so much about who Jehovah is?

00:41:51.269 --> 00:41:53.989
He sent Amos to prophesy

00:41:53.989 --> 00:41:57.429
because he deeply cares how people are treated.

00:41:57.429 --> 00:41:58.710
Isn't that something?

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:00.550
And there's another layer to that.

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:02.909
It says something about Jehovah's sovereignty.

00:42:02.909 --> 00:42:06.670
He's not a distant aloof on feeling God.

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:10.710
He noticed how individual people were being treated.

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:12.789
Oh, I thought about that too.

00:42:12.829 --> 00:42:14.670
So as I was reading,

00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:17.710
I kept looking for indications about Jehovah's feelings

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:18.590
about that.

00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:22.349
I came across chapter five, verses 21 to 23.

00:42:22.349 --> 00:42:24.989
Jehovah says, I hate.

00:42:24.989 --> 00:42:27.070
I despise your festivals.

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:29.510
Even if you offer me whole-burn offerings

00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:32.989
and gift offerings, I will find no pleasure in them.

00:42:32.989 --> 00:42:34.909
Spare me the din of your songs

00:42:34.909 --> 00:42:38.510
and let me not hear the melodies of your string instruments.

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:40.309
Those are powerful words.

00:42:40.349 --> 00:42:42.510
It's as if Jehovah was saying,

00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:46.269
even your attempts at worshiping me makes me sick.

00:42:46.269 --> 00:42:50.630
Jehovah didn't just observe how people were treated.

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:53.349
It affected him emotionally.

00:42:53.349 --> 00:42:57.750
So Jehovah noticed he felt, but then he acted.

00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:00.190
He gave mistreated ones hope.

00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:02.510
The introduction video mentioned Jehovah's promise

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:04.510
to raise up the booth of David.

00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:08.349
Jehovah was reassuring people that the Messiah was coming

00:43:08.349 --> 00:43:11.510
and that there would be no more mistreatment.

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:14.670
What a beautiful glimpse into Jehovah's personality.

00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:16.670
But how does that affect us?

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:20.190
Since Jehovah cares so deeply about how people are treated,

00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:23.829
I ask myself, what does Jehovah see when he looks at me?

00:43:23.829 --> 00:43:25.989
What is my reputation with him?

00:43:25.989 --> 00:43:29.389
Am I known for being kind, patient, merciful?

00:43:29.389 --> 00:43:30.630
Or something else?

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:33.190
And how we treat people really stems

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:35.190
from how we feel about them.

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:37.670
Those nations severely mistreated people

00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:40.630
because they did not love their fellow man.

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:44.030
So my feelings about people matter.

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:46.349
So what about when someone offends me

00:43:46.349 --> 00:43:48.030
or does something unjust?

00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:49.829
Even though I don't harm them physically,

00:43:49.829 --> 00:43:51.710
how do I feel inside?

00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:53.309
Do I harbor animosity?

00:43:53.309 --> 00:43:56.710
Hold a grudge or put a ball between us?

00:43:56.710 --> 00:44:01.150
Jehovah sees not just what I do, but how I feel.

00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:02.550
That's a great point.

00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:03.989
That also makes me think,

00:44:03.989 --> 00:44:05.670
do I notice the disadvantage

00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:08.550
or those who seem discouraged at the meetings?

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:11.269
They may be sitting in the corner by themselves.

00:44:11.269 --> 00:44:15.349
Do I take the initiative to show compassion like Jehovah?

00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:16.670
Nice application.

00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:20.230
Jehovah also sees my reaction to suffering in general.

00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:22.750
So I ask myself, am I indifferent?

00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:26.349
Do I simply say, well, it's just the system we live in.

00:44:26.349 --> 00:44:28.590
Jehovah doesn't see it that way.

00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:31.469
He is highly sensitive to the suffering of others.

00:44:31.469 --> 00:44:32.510
Am I?

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:35.269
I'm amazed at what a few steps can yield.

00:44:35.269 --> 00:44:37.309
Using that 2019 watchtower,

00:44:37.309 --> 00:44:40.070
looking for the attitude or practices Jehovah

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:43.030
was trying to correct, taking brief notes,

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:46.590
and especially looking for how Jehovah feels about matters.

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:49.389
There's still so much more.

00:44:49.389 --> 00:44:51.469
How about this repeated phrase?

00:44:51.469 --> 00:44:53.710
But you did not come back.

00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:55.869
What does that teach us about Jehovah?

00:44:55.869 --> 00:44:57.230
What can we learn from Amos

00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:59.230
about being courageous when we're threatened?

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:01.190
And Howard Jehovah's perfect standards

00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:04.869
highlighted by Amos vision of Jehovah standing on a wall.

00:45:05.429 --> 00:45:06.989
Please, let's keep going.

00:45:06.989 --> 00:45:13.909
We haven't even scratched the surface of the book of Amos.

00:45:13.909 --> 00:45:17.630
How grateful we are that Jehovah in his wisdom

00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:21.389
created an arrangement to end all suffer.

00:45:22.829 --> 00:45:26.230
How can we show gratitude for Jehovah's wisdom?

00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:28.670
Brother Harold Korkin will explain

00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:30.389
in the following morning worship.

00:45:31.989 --> 00:45:34.230
How do we define true wisdom?

00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:37.469
It reflects sound judgment.

00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:40.510
It's the ability to use knowledge

00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:43.269
and understanding to make decisions,

00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:49.309
to achieve a goal, to provide counsel, to avoid danger.

00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:56.030
And related expressions are sensible, discrete, practical.

00:45:57.869 --> 00:46:00.789
And when we think about Godly wisdom,

00:46:00.789 --> 00:46:04.269
those are all attributes that Jehovah displays

00:46:04.269 --> 00:46:08.380
in the absolute sense.

00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:11.380
But now we have to be careful

00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:14.659
that we stay close to the wisdom from above,

00:46:14.659 --> 00:46:17.579
Jehovah's wisdom, and not be fooled

00:46:17.579 --> 00:46:20.179
by the so-called wisdom of this world.

00:46:21.219 --> 00:46:24.739
Now we can tell if something is foolish or wise,

00:46:24.739 --> 00:46:26.380
by the way it all turns out.

00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:29.300
Did it work or not work?

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:32.659
Did things get better or things get worse?

00:46:32.659 --> 00:46:35.500
So what are some of the traits of wisdom from above?

00:46:35.539 --> 00:46:39.500
Let's open our Bibles to James chapter three.

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:42.099
James chapter three, and we're gonna see

00:46:42.099 --> 00:46:47.099
what true wisdom from above produces as works or results.

00:46:48.139 --> 00:46:53.139
Verse 17, but the wisdom from above is first of all,

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:59.300
pure, then peaceable, reasonable, ready to obey

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:03.780
full of mercy and good fruits, impartial,

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:05.739
not hypocritical.

00:47:06.739 --> 00:47:09.179
So we see some very good things come

00:47:09.179 --> 00:47:12.340
when wisdom from above is used,

00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:16.300
the results are peace and success.

00:47:17.539 --> 00:47:20.900
So what we want to talk about for a few moments

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:25.820
is the need to be careful of how we use the right type

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:28.699
of wisdom in our day to day activities

00:47:28.699 --> 00:47:31.579
and our various assignments in this branch territory.

00:47:32.579 --> 00:47:36.579
And we want to be able to be sure not to put on due,

00:47:37.579 --> 00:47:42.219
on due, focus, and importance on secular skills

00:47:42.219 --> 00:47:45.699
compared to Jehovah's wisdom from above.

00:47:46.659 --> 00:47:49.619
Notice how the insight book comments on this point

00:47:49.619 --> 00:47:51.739
under the subject wisdom.

00:47:51.739 --> 00:47:56.059
It says this, hence no matter how much of the world's

00:47:56.059 --> 00:47:59.940
wisdom one might have by virtue of skill and trades,

00:48:00.019 --> 00:48:03.739
shrewdness and commerce, administrative ability,

00:48:03.739 --> 00:48:06.699
or scientific or philosophic learning,

00:48:06.699 --> 00:48:10.500
the rule was, if anyone among you thinks he is wise

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:13.900
in this system of things, let him become a fool

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:15.940
that he may become wise.

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:18.780
And that ends that quote from the insight book

00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:21.739
and the quote of 1 Corinthians 318.

00:48:23.019 --> 00:48:25.539
So what do we learn from that?

00:48:25.539 --> 00:48:28.059
Among our fellow workers in the Bethel family

00:48:28.059 --> 00:48:29.539
and throughout this territory,

00:48:29.579 --> 00:48:32.179
there are many who have excellent skills,

00:48:32.179 --> 00:48:35.179
specialized skills, and we value that.

00:48:35.179 --> 00:48:38.619
Jehovah is using them, but that should never become

00:48:38.619 --> 00:48:41.539
the focal point for the key to success.

00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:44.659
Now just illustrate that point.

00:48:44.659 --> 00:48:48.579
Let's look at a Bible account that illustrates,

00:48:48.579 --> 00:48:51.860
what does the wisdom from above point two

00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:55.619
as the qualifications for someone to care for an assignment?

00:48:55.619 --> 00:48:57.420
What are most important qualities?

00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:01.179
Let's open our Bibles this time to the book of Acts,

00:49:01.179 --> 00:49:04.860
Acts chapter six, and we're going to find

00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:07.460
this problem has arisen.

00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:10.219
The Greek speaking Jews, they are in Acts chapter six

00:49:10.219 --> 00:49:13.179
are saying that their widows are being overlooked

00:49:13.179 --> 00:49:14.699
in the food distribution.

00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:18.900
So how do the 12 handle this?

00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:20.900
What kind of wisdom did they use?

00:49:22.179 --> 00:49:24.380
Well, you'll notice in the six eating verses

00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:27.460
they didn't say we need to get someone

00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:31.659
that really has a lot of secular experience in food

00:49:31.659 --> 00:49:36.659
or distribution or getting product from point A to point B.

00:49:38.179 --> 00:49:41.420
No, what did they focus on?

00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:42.699
Notice verse three.

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:47.860
So brothers, select for yourselves seven reputable men

00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:51.900
from among you, full of spirit, God spirit,

00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:55.940
and wisdom, godly wisdom, that we may appoint them

00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:58.219
over this necessary matter.

00:49:58.219 --> 00:50:01.619
They focused on the spiritual qualities, didn't they?

00:50:01.619 --> 00:50:04.820
And after praying and appointing these men,

00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:07.460
the matter was handled successfully,

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:11.980
not based on secular experience, but on godly qualities.

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:17.579
Now let's take the same concept of not giving undo attention

00:50:17.579 --> 00:50:20.179
to secular ways of doing things.

00:50:20.219 --> 00:50:22.420
This time we're going to look at the contrast

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:26.260
between methods at work and methods that don't work.

00:50:27.659 --> 00:50:30.300
This time we invite you to open your Bibles

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:32.980
to second Chronicles chapter 16.

00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:36.659
And here we're going to be looking at an event

00:50:36.659 --> 00:50:39.940
in King Asa of Judah's reign.

00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:42.980
Now overall, King Asa was a very good king.

00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:48.340
And earlier, one million Ethiopians had come against Asa

00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:53.260
in Judah, and Asa and the people went to Jehovah

00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:55.420
and said, we rely on you.

00:50:56.619 --> 00:50:59.420
We lean on you, not on people.

00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:04.539
Well, later in chapter 16 of second Chronicles,

00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:08.900
Bayesha, the King of Israel, the Northern Kingdom,

00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:12.340
starts building up the fortified city of Rema.

00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:16.059
And this is a threat to Asa and to Judah.

00:51:16.059 --> 00:51:17.820
So what does he do?

00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:20.139
Is he wise or is he foolish?

00:51:21.139 --> 00:51:24.179
Well, this time, according to verses two and three,

00:51:24.179 --> 00:51:28.780
he goes to King Benadad of Syria and says,

00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:30.820
I want to make a tree with you,

00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:33.300
and I'm going to pay you a lot of gold and silver,

00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:36.900
and I want you to attack Bayesha and Northern Israel

00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:38.260
and to stop this threat.

00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:42.380
Benadad takes him up on the offer

00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:46.039
and verses four through six.

00:51:46.039 --> 00:51:48.079
King Bayesha of Israel,

00:51:48.079 --> 00:51:51.829
he stops building Rema.

00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:53.429
Ah, success, correct?

00:51:54.550 --> 00:51:56.150
Not so.

00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:58.670
In the succeeding verses, beginning in verse seven,

00:51:59.909 --> 00:52:02.110
seer by the name of Hanei,

00:52:02.110 --> 00:52:06.190
comes to King Asa and basically says, what are you doing?

00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:10.630
When the Ethiopians came, you relied on Jehovah.

00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:13.030
And now with this threat from Bayesha,

00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:17.829
you go to Benadad and notice how King Asa

00:52:17.869 --> 00:52:22.469
is described in the latter part of Second Chronicles 169.

00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:28.110
You have acted foolishly in this matter.

00:52:28.110 --> 00:52:31.110
From now on, there will be wars against you.

00:52:32.269 --> 00:52:34.230
Now, what do we learn from this account?

00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:38.829
Taking a secular approach, a human approach

00:52:38.829 --> 00:52:43.829
to problems or threats might work a little while.

00:52:44.110 --> 00:52:49.110
Bayesha stopped building Rema, so, ah, that's better.

00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:55.070
But the end result was there was more trouble from Asa

00:52:55.070 --> 00:52:59.949
than before because he failed to exercise godly wisdom

00:52:59.949 --> 00:53:03.619
and trust in Jehovah.

00:53:03.619 --> 00:53:06.139
Well, let's take another aspect of this contrast

00:53:06.139 --> 00:53:10.019
between worldy wisdom and the wisdom from above,

00:53:10.019 --> 00:53:11.260
Jehovah's wisdom.

00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:17.260
Now, the Bible says in the book of Proverbs 11 and verse 2

00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:22.260
that wisdom is with the modest ones.

00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:25.260
Those who recognize their limitations,

00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:28.260
they don't think they have all the answers.

00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:30.260
They're willing to work with other people.

00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:33.260
They especially look to Jehovah.

00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:37.260
But how does the world view a modest person?

00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:41.260
It's summed up among other ways by a quote

00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:46.260
from a Mr. William Haslet, a 19th century English writer,

00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:49.260
and notice how he described modesty.

00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:51.260
It is the lowest of the virtues

00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:55.260
and is a confession of the deficiency it indicates.

00:53:55.260 --> 00:54:01.260
He who undervalues himself is justly undervalued by others.

00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:04.260
So the world says, don't be modest.

00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:05.260
You've got to be strong.

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:06.260
You have all the answers.

00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:08.260
Don't let other people make you think

00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:11.769
that you don't know what you're doing.

00:54:11.769 --> 00:54:15.769
But in contrast, notice this nice quote

00:54:15.769 --> 00:54:20.769
from the 99 watched hour, December 1st, it said this.

00:54:20.769 --> 00:54:23.769
Ability would also become a weakness.

00:54:23.769 --> 00:54:27.769
If through it we developed an inflated opinion of ourselves

00:54:27.769 --> 00:54:29.769
revealing a lack of modesty.

00:54:29.769 --> 00:54:33.769
A gifted person and any who adulate him

00:54:33.769 --> 00:54:37.769
may forget that Jehovah does not regard any who are wise

00:54:37.769 --> 00:54:42.769
in their own heart, gifted, though they may be.

00:54:42.769 --> 00:54:45.769
Wisdom is with the modest ones.

00:54:45.769 --> 00:54:48.769
And that certainly proves, too, doesn't it?

00:54:48.769 --> 00:54:52.769
Because a person who is modest, he's going to be reasonable.

00:54:52.769 --> 00:54:54.769
He's going to create peace.

00:54:54.769 --> 00:54:56.769
He's going to be ready to obey.

00:54:56.769 --> 00:54:58.769
He's going to communicate with fellow workers.

00:54:58.769 --> 00:55:00.769
They're going to enjoy working with him.

00:55:00.769 --> 00:55:04.769
And he will have a pleasant time himself.

00:55:04.769 --> 00:55:09.769
Wisdom from Jehovah is always better.

00:55:09.769 --> 00:55:13.769
When you see good results from applying godly wisdom,

00:55:13.769 --> 00:55:16.769
remember to thank Jehovah for his guidance.

00:55:16.769 --> 00:55:22.769
It warms his heart to hear your gratitude.

00:55:22.769 --> 00:55:25.769
Jehovah also appreciates it when we express love

00:55:25.769 --> 00:55:27.769
for our brothers and sisters.

00:55:27.769 --> 00:55:30.769
As shown in this month's music video,

00:55:30.769 --> 00:55:33.769
entitled A High Her Kind of Love.

00:55:33.769 --> 00:55:43.940
There was something that was said

00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:45.940
that really did stick with me

00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:47.940
that no matter where I am from,

00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:50.940
I can be your family.

00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:53.940
We are worldwide household

00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:55.940
under the law of love

00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:58.940
in the comfort of the caring arms

00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:01.940
of Jehovah God above.

00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:06.940
No sweeter place could I ever find myself in

00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:11.179
than here with you all now.

00:56:11.179 --> 00:56:13.179
I'm singing you are my sister,

00:56:13.179 --> 00:56:14.179
you are my brother,

00:56:14.179 --> 00:56:15.179
you are my father,

00:56:15.179 --> 00:56:16.179
you are my mother,

00:56:16.179 --> 00:56:19.179
and it is not by blood.

00:56:19.179 --> 00:56:22.179
It's a higher kind of love.

00:56:22.179 --> 00:56:23.179
You are my sister,

00:56:23.179 --> 00:56:24.179
you are my brother,

00:56:24.179 --> 00:56:26.179
you are my family,

00:56:26.179 --> 00:56:29.880
and it is not by blood.

00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:38.059
No, it's a higher kind of love.

00:56:38.059 --> 00:56:50.719
It's a certain as the sunrise.

00:56:50.719 --> 00:56:53.719
It's a written guarantee.

00:56:53.719 --> 00:56:55.719
It's the promise of God's own son

00:56:55.719 --> 00:56:58.719
that you will have a family.

00:56:58.719 --> 00:57:01.719
Coming from all walks of life

00:57:01.719 --> 00:57:03.719
praises to God we sing.

00:57:03.719 --> 00:57:06.719
It doesn't matter where we are from,

00:57:06.719 --> 00:57:14.329
it's doing his will at the key.

00:57:14.329 --> 00:57:17.329
So we help each other out.

00:57:17.329 --> 00:57:20.610
Oh, I'm a sister,

00:57:20.610 --> 00:57:21.610
you are my brother,

00:57:21.610 --> 00:57:23.610
you are my father,

00:57:23.610 --> 00:57:24.610
you are my mother,

00:57:24.610 --> 00:57:26.610
and it is not by blood.

00:57:26.610 --> 00:57:29.610
No, it's a higher kind of love.

00:57:29.610 --> 00:57:31.610
You are my sister,

00:57:31.610 --> 00:57:32.610
you are my brother,

00:57:32.610 --> 00:57:33.610
you are my family,

00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:34.610
like no other,

00:57:34.610 --> 00:57:36.610
and it is not by blood.

00:57:36.610 --> 00:57:39.610
No, it's a higher kind of love.

00:57:39.610 --> 00:58:06.409
Just the right time.

00:58:06.409 --> 00:58:09.409
There was something that was said

00:58:09.409 --> 00:58:12.409
that I have really seen

00:58:12.409 --> 00:58:17.130
that no matter your family,

00:58:17.130 --> 00:58:52.780
you are my father,

00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:55.579
and it is not by

00:58:55.579 --> 00:58:59.139
it's a higher kind of love.

00:58:59.139 --> 00:59:00.139
You are my sister,

00:59:00.139 --> 00:59:01.139
you are my brother,

00:59:01.139 --> 00:59:03.139
you are my family,

00:59:03.139 --> 00:59:04.139
like no other,

00:59:04.139 --> 00:59:06.139
and it is not by blood.

00:59:06.139 --> 00:59:10.139
No, it's a higher kind of love.

00:59:10.139 --> 00:59:15.699
In this month's program,

00:59:15.699 --> 00:59:17.699
we've learned that our thinking

00:59:17.699 --> 00:59:18.699
can be elevated

00:59:18.699 --> 00:59:21.699
if we test out Jehovah's support,

00:59:21.699 --> 00:59:25.699
take full advantage of Christian meetings,

00:59:25.699 --> 00:59:27.699
and lean on Jehovah

00:59:27.699 --> 00:59:29.699
in times of trial.

00:59:29.699 --> 00:59:31.699
In this month's postcard,

00:59:31.699 --> 00:59:33.699
we're traveling to a country

00:59:33.699 --> 00:59:35.699
beautifully situated

00:59:35.699 --> 00:59:37.699
between the Pacific Ocean

00:59:37.699 --> 00:59:39.699
and the Caribbean Sea.

00:59:39.699 --> 00:59:41.699
Nicaragua.

00:59:41.699 --> 00:59:44.699
Nicaragua boasts 68 types of ecosystems

00:59:44.699 --> 00:59:48.699
that plants and animals live in.

00:59:48.699 --> 00:59:50.699
Some believe the country's name

00:59:50.699 --> 00:59:52.699
can be traced back to Nicaragua,

00:59:52.699 --> 00:59:54.699
a late 15th-century chief

00:59:54.699 --> 00:59:56.699
who lived on the shore

00:59:56.699 --> 00:59:58.699
of present-day Lake Nicaragua

00:59:58.699 --> 01:00:00.699
and the Spanish conquerors

01:00:00.699 --> 01:00:01.699
arrived.

01:00:01.699 --> 01:00:03.699
Lake Nicaragua is significant

01:00:03.699 --> 01:00:05.699
for another reason.

01:00:05.699 --> 01:00:07.699
It's believed it was originally

01:00:07.699 --> 01:00:10.699
an open bay on the Pacific Ocean.

01:00:10.699 --> 01:00:12.699
After a volcanic eruption,

01:00:12.699 --> 01:00:14.699
a barrier formed,

01:00:14.699 --> 01:00:16.699
turning the bay into two lakes.

01:00:16.699 --> 01:00:18.699
The ocean fish trapped

01:00:18.699 --> 01:00:20.699
in the larger of the two lakes

01:00:20.699 --> 01:00:22.699
adapted as the salt water

01:00:22.699 --> 01:00:25.699
slowly turned fresh.

01:00:25.699 --> 01:00:26.699
For this reason,

01:00:26.699 --> 01:00:28.699
the only fresh water lake

01:00:28.699 --> 01:00:30.699
in the world that contains

01:00:30.699 --> 01:00:32.699
oceanic animal life,

01:00:32.699 --> 01:00:34.699
including sharks,

01:00:34.699 --> 01:00:35.699
swordfish,

01:00:35.699 --> 01:00:37.699
and tarpon.

01:00:37.699 --> 01:00:38.699
Above water,

01:00:38.699 --> 01:00:40.699
there's a chain of volcanoes

01:00:40.699 --> 01:00:42.699
running through the country

01:00:42.699 --> 01:00:44.699
from north to south.

01:00:44.699 --> 01:00:45.699
Set on Negro,

01:00:45.699 --> 01:00:47.699
a frequently visited volcano

01:00:47.699 --> 01:00:49.699
is over 700 meters high

01:00:49.699 --> 01:00:51.699
and takes about an hour

01:00:51.699 --> 01:00:52.699
to climb.

01:00:52.699 --> 01:00:53.699
Going down,

01:00:53.699 --> 01:00:55.699
much faster if you

01:00:55.699 --> 01:00:57.699
have a volcano board.

01:00:57.699 --> 01:00:59.699
The truth arrived in Nicaragua

01:00:59.699 --> 01:01:01.699
in 1934,

01:01:01.699 --> 01:01:03.699
but spiritual momentum

01:01:03.699 --> 01:01:05.699
built in 1945

01:01:05.699 --> 01:01:07.699
when Francis and William Wallace,

01:01:07.699 --> 01:01:09.699
fleshly brothers,

01:01:09.699 --> 01:01:11.699
and graduates from the first

01:01:11.699 --> 01:01:13.699
class of Gilead,

01:01:13.699 --> 01:01:15.699
arrived.

01:01:15.699 --> 01:01:17.699
They used a portable photograph

01:01:17.699 --> 01:01:19.699
to play Bible-based recordings

01:01:19.699 --> 01:01:21.699
to more than 700 people

01:01:21.699 --> 01:01:23.699
in their first month.

01:01:23.699 --> 01:01:25.699
Later that same here,

01:01:25.699 --> 01:01:27.699
four more missionaries

01:01:27.699 --> 01:01:29.699
came to advertise the kingdom.

01:01:29.699 --> 01:01:31.699
Today, people in Nicaragua

01:01:31.699 --> 01:01:33.699
continue to learn the truths

01:01:33.699 --> 01:01:35.699
from the Bible.

01:01:35.699 --> 01:01:37.699
In rural areas,

01:01:37.699 --> 01:01:39.699
people are often hospitable,

01:01:39.699 --> 01:01:41.699
accepting Bible-based publications

01:01:41.699 --> 01:01:43.699
and willing to have

01:01:43.699 --> 01:01:45.699
follow-up discussions.

01:01:45.699 --> 01:01:47.699
Secular employment

01:01:47.699 --> 01:01:49.699
often requires political

01:01:49.699 --> 01:01:50.699
affiliation,

01:01:50.699 --> 01:01:51.699
which our brothers

01:01:51.699 --> 01:01:53.699
turned out.

01:01:53.699 --> 01:01:55.699
To maintain a clear conscience,

01:01:55.699 --> 01:01:57.699
they often choose jobs

01:01:57.699 --> 01:01:59.699
that pay less,

01:01:59.699 --> 01:02:01.699
but allow them to remain

01:02:01.699 --> 01:02:03.699
neutral and united.

01:02:03.699 --> 01:02:05.699
Despite this challenging

01:02:05.699 --> 01:02:07.699
situation,

01:02:07.699 --> 01:02:09.699
there is zeal for true worship

01:02:09.699 --> 01:02:11.699
remains strong.

01:02:11.699 --> 01:02:12.699
For example,

01:02:12.699 --> 01:02:14.699
out of nearly 29,000 publishers,

01:02:14.699 --> 01:02:16.699
there was an all-time

01:02:16.699 --> 01:02:19.699
peak of 5,458

01:02:19.699 --> 01:02:21.699
regular pioneers

01:02:21.699 --> 01:02:23.699
in October, 2024.

01:02:23.699 --> 01:02:25.699
Jehovah is certainly

01:02:25.699 --> 01:02:27.699
blessing the loyalty,

01:02:27.699 --> 01:02:29.699
self-sacrifice,

01:02:29.699 --> 01:02:31.699
and simple lifestyle

01:02:31.699 --> 01:02:33.699
of the friends in Nicaragua.

01:02:33.699 --> 01:02:35.699
Truly, Jehovah's people

01:02:35.699 --> 01:02:37.699
are elevated by pure worship.

01:02:37.699 --> 01:02:39.699
The 39 publishers

01:02:39.699 --> 01:02:41.699
in the Brig-Bay

01:02:41.699 --> 01:02:43.699
mosquito congregation

01:02:43.699 --> 01:02:45.699
send their warm love

01:02:45.699 --> 01:02:50.860
to you.

01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:52.860
From the World Headquarters

01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:54.860
of Jehovah's Witnesses,

01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:56.860
this is JW Broadcasting.
