00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.699
Do you see anything?

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:10.699
Do you see any witnesses?

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:13.699
What are they?

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:18.699
Psalm 27 is really going to help us.

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.699
Jehovah is my light and my salvation.

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:23.699
Whom should I fear?

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.699
Jehovah is the stronghold of my life.

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.699
Whom should I dread?

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.699
When evil then attack me to devour my flesh.

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.700
My adversaries and my enemies were the ones who stumbled and fell.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.700
Though an army should set up camp against me,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.700
my heart will not fear.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.700
The war should break out against me,

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.700
even then I will remain confident.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.700
One thing I have asked of Jehovah.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.700
Where would I be if I did not have faith

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.700
that I would see Jehovah's goodness in the land of the living?

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.700
Hope in Jehovah.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.700
Be courageous and strong of heart.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.700
Yes.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.700
Hope in Jehovah.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.700
Thank you, Brother Brown.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.700
That Psalm is very faith-strengthening.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.700
It is, Chris.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.700
Especially the question at verse 13.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.700
Where would I be if I did not have faith?

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.700
I think all of us can identify with that question.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.700
Absolutely.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.700
Without faith, none of us would be here.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.700
All of us here.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.700
And all of our brothers everywhere.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.700
At this hour,

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.700
we can all feel good that we've worked hard

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.700
to build faith in Jehovah's promises.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.700
We've all resisted temptations.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.700
To serve God half-heartedly

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.700
with a date in mind or for some selfish reason.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:55.299
Instead of just going through the motions of being a disciple,

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.299
our faith is real, it's genuine.

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.299
Paul called that faith faith without hypocrisy.

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.300
And to have seen you build that kind of faith,

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.300
just warms my heart.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.300
You studied God's Word to better understand His ways

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.300
and His promises.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.300
That has made your faith strong today.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.300
You reasoned on Jehovah's past dealings with you

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.300
and that has given you strength

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.300
to remain loyal under test.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.300
And your faith has led you here

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.300
as loyal servants of Jehovah.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:51.300
Confident that Psalm 97 verse 10 applies to you personally.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.300
Jehovah is guarding the lives of His loyal ones.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:17.259
Shut the basement.

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:18.259
Shut back.
