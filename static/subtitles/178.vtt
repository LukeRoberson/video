00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.980
Do you sometimes feel completely overwhelmed when life's problems cause you anxiety?

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.980
Just trying to provide the necessities for one's family can lead to anxiety.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.980
At the same time, you might be dealing with a chronic or life-threatening illness,

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:26.980
caring for a sick or elderly relative, grieving the death of a loved one, loneliness,

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:36.979
a natural disaster, or maybe you're struggling with the devastating effects of past or present abuse.

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:43.979
Now, you firmly believe that God's kingdom will fix these problems, but that's in the future.

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:46.979
What about today?

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:51.979
Perhaps you feel like David, who prayed at Psalm 13 and verse 2,

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:58.979
how long will I have anxious concern with grief in my heart each day?

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:04.980
A sister who has struggled with anxiety for many years wrote this.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:14.980
Anxiety robs me of sleep, impacts my health, affects the way I treat others, and makes me want to give up.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.980
She added,

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:23.980
anxiety is like a monster that lives in my body somewhere between my heart and my belly.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.980
I cannot wait for Jehovah to kill that monster in the new world.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:35.980
But until then, the monster snarls and tears at my insides and tries to take over my life.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.260
Can you identify with her feelings?

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:48.260
We often hear a person say concerning anxiety, I'm just trying to take it one day at a time.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
But one brother put it this way.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.260
I try to take it one day at a time, but sometimes several days attack me at once.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:04.260
For so many of us, anxiety is a daily struggle.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.259
If you battle with anxiety, please know this.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.259
You are not alone. Do not give up the fight.

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:21.259
Jehovah and Jesus are aware of the anxieties that weigh on your mind and that are deep in your heart.

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:28.259
The governing body knows that living in this system of things is especially hard to deal with.

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:36.259
So the theme chosen for this program is, deal with anxiety one day at a time.

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:41.539
First, what is anxiety?

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:47.539
In the Christian Greek scriptures, the word anxious occurs 19 times.

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:51.539
The first occurrence is in Jesus' sermon on the Mount.

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:55.539
Now Jesus knew that people worried about how to provide for their family.

00:02:55.539 --> 00:03:02.539
So at Matthew, chapter 6, and verse 25, he gave this wise counsel.

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:11.539
On this account, I say to you, stop being anxious about your life as to what you eat or what you will drink.

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:14.539
Or about your body as to what you will wear.

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:21.099
Does not life mean more than food and the body than clothing?

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:33.099
The study Bible, note for verse 25, says the degree term for anxious can refer to worry that divides a person's mind and distracts him, robbing him of joy.

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:43.099
At Luke 12, verse 29, Jesus says to stop being an anxious suspense or to stop worrying.

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:52.099
The study note here says that the Greek word for anxious suspense was used to refer to ships being tossed at sea.

00:03:53.099 --> 00:04:05.099
It says that Jesus used it figuratively for being anxious or unsettled as if tossed about or wavering because of doubt and anxiety.

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:13.099
By saying, stop being anxious, Jesus recognizes that anxiety is already in progress.

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:17.100
He is very aware of our imperfect nature.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:31.100
He knows that we tend to bring our worries from yesterday, the wood haves, could haves, and should haves, and our imagined worries about tomorrow, the what ifs, to today.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:44.100
But ask yourself, how often have I word myself sick about what might happen tomorrow only to find that tomorrow wasn't nearly as bad as I feared it would be?

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:51.100
Jesus also knows that anxiety can have real, sometimes painful consequences.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.100
It can stop us from making spiritual progress.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:02.100
Overthinking and over analyzing our problems can literally shut us down.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:08.100
How though can we stop being anxious? What's the antidote?

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.100
Let's consider four practical things we can do.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:19.100
First, rely on Jehovah and take one day at a time.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:28.100
This is exactly what Jesus prescribed for us at Matthew chapter 6 verses 33 and 34.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:36.100
Keep on then seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:44.100
So, never be anxious about the next day for the next day will have its own anxieties.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.100
Each day has enough of its own troubles.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:06:05.100
Verse 34 has a study note telling us that undue anxiety about what may happen in the future can adversely affect a person's relationship with God, causing him to rely on his own wisdom rather than on God's.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:14.100
So what's the lesson? Instead of relying on ourselves, rely on Jehovah and take one day at a time.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:21.100
Across reference to Matthew 634 takes us to Exodus 16 verse 4.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:29.100
In this account, Jehovah provided the Israelites with enough mana for every day of their 40-year trek.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.100
Could Jehovah have provided a week's worth of mana?

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:38.100
A month's worth, a year's worth, of course.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:44.100
So why did he only provide enough for each day? Well, think about it.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:56.100
When they stepped out of their tents each morning, there was no question whether there would be mana on the ground or not, and there was no question where it came from.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:03.100
Jehovah never failed to provide for their needs, not even for one day.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:10.100
They also knew from the past that Jehovah always provided for those who were loyal to him.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.100
We too can look back at how Jehovah provided for his servants.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:26.100
We can have complete confidence that Jehovah knows exactly what we need when we need it, for today, tomorrow, and for all eternity.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:33.100
Even if we have such confidence, why do we sometimes continue to feel anxious?

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:41.100
The simple answer, we're imperfect people trying our best to serve Jehovah in Satan's wicked world.

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:48.100
Daily challenges cause anxiety that can make us forget to rely on Jehovah and take one day to time.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:53.100
So we need to add our second way to deal with anxiety.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:58.100
Pour your heart out to Jehovah in earnest prayer.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:04.100
Read with me the reassuring words at Philippians 4, verses 6 and 7.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:17.100
Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication, along with Thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:28.100
And the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:33.100
Paul doesn't simply tell us not to be anxious, but he tells us how.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:42.100
He said by prayer and supplication, which is earnest and specific prayer.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:49.100
With what benefit the peace of God will guard your hearts.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:55.100
Guard was a military expression referring to troops assigned to protect a city.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:09:02.100
The inhabitants could sleep soundly knowing that soldiers were guarding them at night.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:09.100
In a similar way, when we have the peace of God, our hearts and minds can rest.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:14.100
This can prevent us from being overwhelmed by anxiety or discouragement.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:21.100
How reassuring are the words of the Psalmist at Psalm 4 and verse 8.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:30.100
I will lie down and sleep in peace for you alone, O Jehovah, make me dwell in security.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:42.100
So when we feel trapped, like there's no way out of our worries, the peace from God gives us hope that there's light at the end of the tunnel.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:45.100
What though must you do?

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:50.100
Turn your worries into deep, heartfelt prayers.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:59.100
In fact, at 1 Peter 5 and verse 7, Jehovah invites you to throw all your anxiety on him and leave it with him.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.100
Because he cares for you.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:07.100
Jehovah is the one person who truly understands how you feel.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:13.100
He knows every moment of your life, why you feel or react a certain way.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:23.100
He loves and values you personally, despite your imperfections, your anxieties, your cares and worries.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:29.100
He not only has the power to help you, he wants to.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:42.100
Knowing this should move you to pray specifically, expressing your deepest emotions, and plead that he grant you peace of mind and heart.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:50.100
To the extent you do so, 1 Peter 5-10 promises that he will make you firm.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:56.100
He will make you strong. He will firmly ground you.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:00.100
Never underestimate the power of prayer.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:05.100
Jehovah is always ready to help you one day at a time.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:13.450
Our third way to deal with anxiety is to read and meditate on God's Word.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:20.450
Let Jehovah speak to you. Allow Jehovah's thoughts to become your thoughts.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:27.450
At Psalm 94-19, notice how this psalmist admitted his own anxiety.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:36.950
When anxieties overwhelm me, you comforted and soothed me.

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:45.950
Yes, even servants of God can feel overwhelmed by anxieties, or as one translation says, burden with worries.

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:52.950
That in itself is comforting, that an inspired Bible writer struggled with anxieties.

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:59.950
But Jehovah comforted and soothed him, calming his troubled heart.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:04.950
God can do the same for us through his inspired Word of the Bible.

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:09.950
Remember, the Bible is how Jehovah speaks to us.

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:17.950
Rather than allowing our emotions to run wild, we can learn to focus our mind on upbuilding things,

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:23.950
such as what the Apostle Paul listed at Philippians 4 and verse 8.

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:30.950
Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are of serious concern,

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:36.950
whatever things are righteous, whatever things are chased, whatever things are lovable,

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:41.950
whatever things are well spoken of, whatever things are virtuous,

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:48.950
and whatever things are praiseworthy, continue considering these things.

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:56.950
The footnote to verse 8 shows that considering involves thinking about or meditating on.

00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:05.950
We can and should meditate on positive things from the Bible, replacing negative things that may enter our mind

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:08.950
and cause anxiety.

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:15.950
Ask Jehovah to help you to find passages in his Word that will soothe your heart.

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:20.950
Ask others what scriptures have calmed their heart during anxious moments.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:29.950
Make your own personal list, then set aside time to read and meditate on those passages.

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:33.950
Meditation is the doorway to your heart.

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:39.950
Meditation lets God's thoughts affect you on the deepest possible level.

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:45.950
Imagine that Jehovah is speaking directly to you because he is.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:52.950
Never underestimate the power of God's Word, of letting Jehovah speak to you.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:59.950
Our fourth way to deal with anxiety is to share your feelings with a trusted friend.

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:08.230
Proverbs 12, 25, says, anxiety in a man's heart weighs it down,

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:11.230
or as a footnote says, depresses him.

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:14.230
But a good word cheers it up.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:22.230
A good word can come from a fellow believer who is motivated by God's Spirit and guided by his Word.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:27.230
When the Apostle Paul was alone in prison, he prayed for encouragement,

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:31.230
and Jehovah provided what he needed to cheer him up.

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:36.230
With a heart full of appreciation, he said at Colossians 4-11,

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:44.230
that my fellow workers had become a source of great comfort to me, or a strengthening aid.

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:50.230
What can you do if you feel weighed down or imprisoned by anxiety?

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:53.230
Like Paul, pray for encouragement.

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:56.230
Pray for someone you can talk to.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:59.230
Someone you can trust with your feelings.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:06.230
The answer to your prayer may be an elder or a mature Christian brother or sister.

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:12.230
But what if it's difficult for you to open up to others and confide in them?

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:17.230
Try the advice in the March 1st, 1997 Watchtower article,

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:20.230
are you afraid to trust others?

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:26.230
When confiding in someone, it says, reveal your concerns gradually.

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:32.230
If he or she responds in an appropriate sympathetic and discrete way,

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:36.230
you might then try disclosing more.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:42.230
Even if it takes some effort, never underestimate the power of our brotherhood.

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:48.230
Jehovah can use a fellow worshiper to ease your mind of anxious concern.

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:54.230
Even at times when there's no one to talk to, we can let the experiences,

00:15:54.230 --> 00:16:02.230
upbuilding music, and talks on JW broadcasting be like an encouraging hug from a trusted friend.

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:08.230
Yes, when we make the effort, we give Jehovah something to bless.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:13.230
Jehovah can help us conquer the seemingly incomparable.

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:17.230
That may not mean that we'll completely eliminate anxiety,

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:21.230
but we can learn to take control.

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:25.230
How? Remember our four ways.

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:31.230
First, rely on Jehovah and take one day at a time.

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:37.230
Second, pour out your heart to Jehovah in earnest specific prayer.

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:41.230
Third, read and meditate on God's word.

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.230
Let Jehovah speak to you.

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:48.230
Fourth, share your feelings with a trusted friend.

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:54.230
With Jehovah's help, you can deal with anxiety one day at a time.
