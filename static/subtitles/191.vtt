00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:07.360
My comments this month are drawn from First Corinthians 310,

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.359
let each one keep watching how he is building.

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:13.359
Building?

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:17.359
Are we talking about the upcoming construction of a facility

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.359
for headquarters departments in Ramapo, New York?

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.359
Or are we referring to the building of new kingdom halls

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.359
in your country?

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.359
Well, as important as those building projects are,

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:37.359
my comments are directed to an even more important building work.

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:46.570
Let's look at the context in First Corinthians 3 and verse 5.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.570
A pause and Paul are mentioned by name

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.570
and what was their specific role identified to be?

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.570
Verse 5 says,

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.570
Ministers through whom you became believers.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.569
A pause and Paul had taught the Scriptures to many in Corinth.

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:07.569
In verses 6 through 9,

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:12.569
Paul likens this teaching activity to the planting of a field.

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:16.569
Seeds of truth are planted in the heart of a person.

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:19.569
By means of return visits and Bible studies,

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:22.569
the seeds are watered.

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:25.569
But if the person is receptive,

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:28.569
then with Jehovah's spirit and blessing,

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:36.569
the truth will blossom and grow to the point of dedication and baptism.

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:39.569
Did you notice in verse 9,

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:45.569
Bible teachers are described as God's fellow workers?

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:49.569
What an awesome privilege we have to assist Jehovah

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:54.569
in gathering the precious things of all the nations.

00:01:54.569 --> 00:02:02.010
So we now know the topic of these verses in First Corinthians 3.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:08.009
It's discussing Bible teachers who help others to become believers.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.009
But did you also notice that in verse 9,

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:15.009
Paul changes illustrations.

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:16.009
He said,

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:20.009
You are God's field under cultivation.

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:23.009
That's agricultural.

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:28.009
But then he changes the analogy saying God's building.

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:30.009
That's architectural.

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:33.009
That's construction.

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:37.009
Why the change in illustrations?

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:42.009
The building analogy highlights a specific point.

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:50.009
The illustration of the farmer doesn't focus on the farmer's impact on the growth of a plant.

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:54.009
In that illustration, the farmer waters the seedling.

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:59.009
But it's God that makes the plant grow.

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:07.009
However, the illustration of building or construction focuses on the builder's involvement

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:10.009
or the Bible teachers involvement.

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:17.009
The one constructing a building has considerable influence or the quality of the end product.

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:21.009
What kind of materials does he select?

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:24.009
Is he thorough in his work?

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:28.009
Or does he cut corners to get the job done faster?

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:31.009
Or with less effort?

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:37.009
Now let's read the 10th verse of First Corinthians chapter 3.

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:42.610
According to the undeserved kindness of God that was given to me,

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:49.610
I laid a foundation as a skilled master builder, but someone else is building on it.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:55.610
But let each one keep watching how he is building on it.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:03.610
There in Corinth, Paul as a master builder had initially acquainted many with the truth.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.610
In effect, he laid a foundation for others to build on.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.610
But what was that foundation?

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.610
Verse 11 says,

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:23.610
For no one can lay any other foundation than what is laid which is Jesus Christ.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:30.610
Paul had helped establish the congregation there in Corinth based on the teachings of Jesus,

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.610
the foundation of the truth.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:43.610
Building on that foundation, others would become Bible teachers and help still others to progress toward baptism.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:50.610
That is why Paul cautioned in verse 10 to keep watching how we build.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.610
We can affect the outcome.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:00.610
So to all of us Bible teachers, including parents, we ask the question,

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.949
how are we building on the foundation?

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.949
Why does it really matter?

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:12.949
Let's read verses 12 and 13.

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:21.949
Now if anyone builds on the foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay or straw,

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:24.949
each one's work will be shown for what it is.

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:30.949
For the day will show it up because it will be revealed by means of fire

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:36.949
and the fire itself will prove what sort of work each one has built.

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:43.949
Do we understand how important it is to analyze our teaching techniques?

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:51.949
Will we use the best techniques possible to reach our student or our child's heart?

00:05:51.949 --> 00:06:03.949
Or do we just try to get by with the bare essentials and affect a half-hearted effort using hay or straw as a word?

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:08.949
Some years ago, in one developing country during an economic boom,

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:14.949
it became a priority to build more and more schools.

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:21.949
Unfortunately, building requirements and materials were substandard.

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:29.949
Well, what happened when a 7.9 magnitude earthquake hit one of the areas?

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:38.949
Many schools in the earthquake zone crumbled while buildings around them remained standing.

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:45.949
An official report indicated that over 5,000 students died.

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:48.949
Think about it.

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:54.949
Prior to the earthquake, schools were in session and everything seemed fine.

00:06:54.949 --> 00:07:00.949
Students and faculty were coming and going on a daily basis.

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:14.230
But the unforeseen earthquake proved that the building methods used were not of the quality needed to prevent collapse and terrible carnage.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:29.230
First Corinthians 313 makes clear that how we build spiritually when teaching Bible students or our children is just as important.

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:38.230
Now, notice the sobering point made in verses 14 and 15.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:46.800
If anyone's work that he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.800
If anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:58.800
But he himself will be saved, yet if so, it will be as through fire.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:06.800
The point in verse 14 is that if we're conscientious and reach the heart of our Bible students,

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:13.800
that may be what gives them the needed fortitude to withstand an unexpected trial.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.800
In that case, our diligent work remains.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:27.800
Then verse 15 makes the point that if our teaching techniques were inconsistent or were in some way slip-shod,

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:35.799
a student may not successfully weather a fire or stormy trial in his life.

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:42.799
We personally may survive, but we might suffer the loss of the one we studied with,

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:48.179
whether a Bible student or our own child.

00:08:48.179 --> 00:08:57.179
That's why Paul is highlighting the need to be the best Bible teacher we personally can be.

00:08:57.179 --> 00:09:08.179
However, we should mention that if a person who progresses to dedication and baptism later leaves the truth,

00:09:08.179 --> 00:09:13.179
it's not necessarily the responsibility of the Bible teacher.

00:09:13.179 --> 00:09:21.179
The teacher may have been very diligent and use the best of spiritual building materials.

00:09:21.179 --> 00:09:26.179
But the student or child may not have responded from his heart,

00:09:26.179 --> 00:09:35.179
or possibly he allowed human imperfection or temptation to cause him to deviate from the way.

00:09:35.179 --> 00:09:48.179
But the takeaway point from 1 Corinthians chapter 3 is to do our best to build in our students or children fire resistant materials.

00:09:48.179 --> 00:09:56.620
We want them to remain, to endure the tests that are sure to come their way.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:03.620
What might be likened to building with inferior materials when studying the Bible with someone?

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:11.620
Possibly, we initially arouse a person's interest by telling him about the hope of everlasting life and paradise.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.620
That's indeed scriptural.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:23.620
But is that in itself building in such a way that the person will survive a fiery trial of faith in the future?

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:28.990
What if our teaching consisted solely of saying,

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:37.990
if you want to live forever in paradise, you must study, go to the meetings, and share in the preaching work.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:51.990
If so, we are not building in a way to ensure that the student or child will resist the fire of trials or stand the test of time.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:59.429
In effect, we're using wood, hay, or straw.

00:10:59.429 --> 00:11:04.429
Do you remember that Paul said we are to build on the foundation?

00:11:04.429 --> 00:11:11.429
He said the foundation is Jesus Christ. That is solid.

00:11:11.429 --> 00:11:26.429
Ephesians chapter 3, 16 and 17, helps us to understand what it means to build with quality materials such as gold, silver, and precious stones.

00:11:26.429 --> 00:11:37.429
In verse 16, it makes clear that there's a way that we can be made mighty in the person we are inside.

00:11:37.429 --> 00:11:40.429
Let's read verse 17,

00:11:40.429 --> 00:11:46.429
and that through your faith you may have the Christ dwell in your hearts with love.

00:11:46.429 --> 00:11:51.429
May you be rooted and established on the foundation.

00:11:52.429 --> 00:11:59.429
How can we help our child or Bible student become strong or mighty spiritually?

00:11:59.429 --> 00:12:06.429
Interestingly, verse 17 said that it's by having the Christ dwell in your hearts.

00:12:06.429 --> 00:12:17.429
Not just knowing Jesus in the head, but sounding His teachings and personality down into our student's heart.

00:12:17.429 --> 00:12:29.429
It means to know Jesus so well that it's as if He lives or dwells inside of us and motivates us as Christians.

00:12:29.429 --> 00:12:39.429
The result, verse 17 concluded by saying that the student would become rooted and established on the foundation.

00:12:39.429 --> 00:12:45.429
Yes, solidly grounded on Jesus Christ.

00:12:45.429 --> 00:12:55.429
And Hebrews 1 3 says that Jesus is the reflection of God's glory and the exact representation of His very being.

00:12:55.429 --> 00:12:58.429
Jesus Himself said,

00:12:58.429 --> 00:13:02.429
No one comes to the Father except through me.

00:13:02.429 --> 00:13:09.429
So building with fire-resistant materials means helping the student to love Jesus, yes.

00:13:09.429 --> 00:13:15.429
But also having a close, loving relationship with Jehovah God Himself.

00:13:15.429 --> 00:13:20.000
But why are we considering the theme?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Keep watching how you are building now.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.570
Why is this more urgent than ever before?

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:42.570
It's because all indications scripturally and circumstantially point to Satan's evil system of things coming to an abrupt end.

00:13:42.570 --> 00:14:01.070
The physical indications of Matthew chapter 24 and the bizarre temperament described in 2 Timothy 3 1 through 5 become more and more precise as we watch the scene of this world unfold.

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:13.070
We can expect even more opposition and persecution from those who are opposed to our resolve to stand on the side of Jehovah.

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:19.070
Our brothers in Russia and other lands are experiencing this now.

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:24.070
Some have been beaten and brutalized in other ways.

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:30.070
As we've heard, others have been sentenced to years in prison.

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:40.669
In recent years, the organization has reminded us of what we can expect as the great tribulation begins.

00:14:40.669 --> 00:14:51.669
Do you remember this video clip from the pursue what builds loyalty video series shown at the 2016 regional convention?

00:14:52.669 --> 00:15:07.669
In your faith has led you here as loyal servants of Jehovah, confident that Psalm 97 verse 10 applies to you personally.

00:15:07.669 --> 00:15:29.139
Jehovah is guarding the lives of his loyal ones.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:16:22.779
That video series has been affectionately called the basement video.

00:16:22.779 --> 00:16:32.779
It was depicting one possible scenario that could be considered a fire according to 1 Corinthians 313.

00:16:32.779 --> 00:16:44.779
The serious question we want to ask ourselves is, would my Bible student or child be in the basement with those other faithful brothers and sisters?

00:16:44.779 --> 00:17:01.779
If not, would the reason be because of his own lack of faith or might it at least in part be because we did not take our responsibility as a teacher seriously enough?

00:17:02.779 --> 00:17:09.779
Did we build with fire resistant materials or in effect with hay or straw?

00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:17.119
The same verse said, for the day we'll show it up.

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:22.119
The fire itself will prove what sort of work each one has built.

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:26.119
It's a sobering thought, isn't it?

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:33.119
If you recall in the May 2020 JW broadcasting monthly program,

00:17:33.119 --> 00:17:43.119
further let address the concern a few parents have expressed about some of our videos that depict biblical or modern day situations.

00:17:43.119 --> 00:17:51.119
In these times true worshipers are depicted as having their faith tested as if by fire.

00:17:51.119 --> 00:18:09.119
The concern expressed as it some scenes could have an effect on children who've been protected from all negative circumstances on TV, including daily news reports of catastrophes being faced by real people.

00:18:09.119 --> 00:18:17.119
The basement scene we just reviewed was one of our videos that produced such a reaction.

00:18:17.119 --> 00:18:26.119
Another one was the reenactment of the Bible account depicting Jehovah's Saving Acts in the time of King Hezekiah.

00:18:26.119 --> 00:18:35.119
It was shown at the 2016 regional convention and the video was entitled, oh Jehovah, I trust in you.

00:18:35.119 --> 00:19:00.220
Let's look again at that portrayal of Jehovah's Saving Acts.

00:19:06.599 --> 00:19:16.599
If a parent has shielded his child from viewing all scenes on the news or other visual images depicting negative realities,

00:19:16.599 --> 00:19:21.599
it's understandable that there may be a concern.

00:19:21.599 --> 00:19:34.599
However, as Brother Let's stated, parents need to give their children a realistic idea of what we will face in the near future.

00:19:34.599 --> 00:19:49.599
Many parents choose to help their children appreciate the graphic visual imagery of a Bible based account while at the same time building trust in Jehovah who will be with them in times of distress.

00:19:49.599 --> 00:19:58.599
The point is friends, the Bible warns us young and old alike that a time of fiery testing looms on the horizon.

00:19:58.599 --> 00:20:05.599
We want to be realistic and face these events with faith and courage.

00:20:05.599 --> 00:20:19.039
Our videos depict such circumstances in a tasteful and sanitized way, not showing any actual acts of bloodshed or violence.

00:20:19.039 --> 00:20:26.039
Be assured that the governing body is not trying to scare anyone.

00:20:26.039 --> 00:20:31.039
Instead, we are trying to prepare everyone.

00:20:31.039 --> 00:20:42.039
We feel responsible to fortify the brotherhood by using fire-resistant building materials in the spirit of 1 Corinthians chapter 3.

00:20:42.039 --> 00:20:56.039
As teachers of the Word of God, may we all give prayerful thought to the methods, techniques, and the diligence we display when conducting Bible studies.

00:20:56.039 --> 00:21:05.289
We're motivated by the very spirit of Jehovah God, the words at 2 Peter 3.9 come to mind.

00:21:05.289 --> 00:21:17.289
After Jehovah it says, he does not desire anyone to be destroyed, but desires all to attain to repentance.

00:21:17.289 --> 00:21:28.289
May that be our resolve, as we take to heart the inspired words of 1 Corinthians 3.10, let each one keep watching how he is building.
