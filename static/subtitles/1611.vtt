00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:20.199
Friends give me help when I need them the most. They make me laugh, they give me

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:26.359
practical assistance whenever I need them. They're just a real source of joy in my life.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:32.799
When I see my dear friends going through difficult times but still serving

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:39.359
Jehovah, that really encourages me with my trials. Friendship, it just enhances

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:46.640
and enriches a person's life. I don't think that friendship is something that I

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.640
find unnatural. I'm shy by nature, I'm hesitant by nature, I feel inadequate by nature.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.880
In my mind, Barric was simply Jeremiah's secretary. I'd never considered that

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.680
after spending so much time together it would have allowed them to go closer as

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.719
friends. When I studied the article about Jeremiah and Barric, it made me

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:17.959
reflect on friendships that I have but when you work together for Jehovah, it takes

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:23.079
your friendship to another level. Jehovah's people will have a depth and a

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:28.400
dimension to their friendships which will not be shared by those who are not serving

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.489
Jehovah. In the article I really loved at the point about communication, being

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:41.370
open with others, it allows them to be welcome with you and that just allows

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:50.849
a friendship to flourish. I can have a very bad view of myself. I appreciated the

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:57.109
reminder that you will see the bad side of any friend. That's just normal but

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:02.709
good friends remind you of your good side that is like Jehovah talking and

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:09.800
reminding me how much I'm loved by him. I'd heard that Keith and older brother

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.680
was returning to Britain for some medical treatment. He was much loved deeply

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.479
respected. You try and picture and imagine what's going through his mind, his

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:27.759
fears, anxieties. I felt very inadequate but I realised it would be the loving

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:33.199
and kind thing to do to speak to him. So we spent some time together we talked

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:39.319
I felt honored just to say a prayer with someone like that. I was really touched

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:45.360
by Keith's response. He clearly deeply appreciated that and I felt thrilled to have

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:52.770
done just a little something that helped that supported him. I've worked with

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:59.969
someone that I never expected to become very close to. Charlotte, she's the

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:06.610
opposite to me but I came to realise quite early on she's an amazing listener.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:17.159
Charlotte is more than a friend. She's now a family. I love my family very very

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:22.560
much. At the moment I am the only one in my family who is one of Jehovah's

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.740
witnesses but I've never felt I was truly alone. Jehovah always provided

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.460
brothers, sisters, mothers you know uncles aren't easy. He's always given me

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:41.500
everyone I needed. I feel I've had a lesson powerfully reinforced of the blessings

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.139
of genuine friendship. When we make an effort just to give Jehovah a little

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:53.300
something that you can add is blessing. In my experience the person you don't

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:59.419
expect actually turns out to be a very special friend. When you work with

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:04.099
different brothers and sisters I really appreciate they are gifts from Jehovah.

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:12.340
And so give all of you into one. Working hard for Jehovah and being genuine

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.139
that will attract other brothers and sisters. We will never forget the

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:23.220
friendships that we make right now. Jehovah will use those friendships to help

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.100
us through the great tribulation.
