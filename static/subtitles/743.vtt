WEBVTT

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.980
All of you are humble people.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.019
If you weren't, you'd never have been invited to Gilead.

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:19.539
Have you ever noticed, though, that where humility is concerned, we do well in some situations,

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.019
not so well in others?

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:27.780
For example, if someone commends us for a good job on a talk on the midweek meeting or

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:34.979
perhaps a comment on the watchtower study, we give all credit to Jehovah and to the training

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:38.380
we've received, and that's good.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.579
But in other situations, we might get into trouble.

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.340
In other situations, our humility might be put to the test.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:57.259
Now at Bethel, as has been mentioned on this program already, we all work with people.

00:00:57.259 --> 00:01:03.219
We all work closely with others, as some of you sisters work on a team.

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:08.579
You work with others, and you brothers, you all have responsibilities in the congregation

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:12.019
or at Bethel or perhaps both.

00:01:12.019 --> 00:01:16.819
But in all situations, humility is needed.

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:23.099
So I thought that this morning we might consider what we can learn about humility from Jehovah

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:29.019
and from the apostles of Jesus Christ.

00:01:29.019 --> 00:01:32.340
Now, humility is a broad term.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.340
So let's narrow it down a little bit.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.900
Let's consider a couple of aspects of humility.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.019
And the first one I'm going to mention might surprise you.

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:48.739
A insight on the Scriptures tells us that humility includes the ability to show mercy

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:52.540
and compassion to others.

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:59.859
The ability to show mercy and compassion to others.

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:04.900
The ability to make exceptions where that is warranted.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.099
Well, that's Jehovah, isn't it?

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.979
Jehovah isn't rigid.

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:17.740
Jehovah knows when to make exceptions.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.259
How often did you read in the Bible as you went through?

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:23.819
Jehovah reconsidered.

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.060
Jehovah makes perfect rules.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.819
And yet at times he reconsideres.

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.939
Now let's illustrate.

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:36.419
These lights are getting ready to conquer the promised land.

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:40.020
And the first up is the city of Jericho.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.979
Now there's a rule, a rule of engagement, and it's very clear.

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:51.020
Jehovah says, you must not make any covenant with them

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.419
or show them any favor.

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:59.780
No covenant, no favor, that's the rule.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.659
It's a perfect rule because it's Jehovah's rule.

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:08.020
Joshua sent two spies into the city,

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.860
and they went to the home of a prostitute named Rahab.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.020
Now wait a minute.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.219
Let's think about that.

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:20.340
Pretty easy to say, isn't it?

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.580
Joshua sent two spies into the city.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.659
They went into a house of a prostitute named Rahab.

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.580
Now we often think about the faith of Rahab.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.379
But what about the faith of those two spies?

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.620
Can you imagine the faith that it took for those men?

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:46.419
The Bible says they were young men to go into that city.

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.819
Now if they were under 40 years of age,

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:54.500
they were born in the wilderness.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.680
How many cities had they ever seen?

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.439
Had they ever seen a city before?

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:06.800
How many actual houses had they entered?

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.479
How many foreigners had they ever met?

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:12.479
Maybe not very many.

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:14.800
Maybe a couple on the other side of the Jordan,

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.399
but not very many.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:21.639
So now, as soon as they enter the city, what happens?

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.160
Someone calls the police.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.519
They're recognized right away.

00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:28.879
And no wonder, first of all, they

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:31.360
weren't dressed like canonites.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.800
You couldn't order your clothes from Amazon.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.360
And those days, you know, they were dressed like Israelites.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.920
They probably had on 40-year-old hand-me-downs

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.389
from their fathers who had died in the desert.

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.550
So they didn't look like canonites.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.949
They didn't blend in.

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.910
And as soon as they opened their mouth,

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.670
people would say, you're not from around here, are you?

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.550
You don't speak the canonite language.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.470
So no wonder they were discovered.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.790
They had to get off the street.

00:05:07.829 --> 00:05:10.709
They had to get out of sight.

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:14.389
And you wonder if Jehovah directed them to rehab.

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:18.149
You wonder if Jehovah saw something in rehab, something

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:21.189
in her heart that he could work with.

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:24.790
Or do you believe that it was a coincidence

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.790
that the spies were led to the only family in Jericho

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.230
that was worth saving?

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.230
It could be that Jehovah was involved with that.

00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:39.589
Well, rehab decides that she's going to hide the spies,

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:41.269
but she has a condition.

00:05:41.269 --> 00:05:43.949
And if you'd like to turn to judges,

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:47.939
or Joshua, or rather, chapter two,

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:50.379
we'll see what that condition was.

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:52.540
I'll give you a moment.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:58.250
We're going to read that Joshua, chapter two, and verse 13.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.050
This is rehab.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.449
No, we don't know how she communicated with them.

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:04.889
Must have been a lot of sign language.

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:06.930
We heard about sign language a minute ago.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.649
Must have been a lot of sign language going on

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:12.610
because the Canaanite language wasn't quite like Hebrew,

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.050
you know, but anyway, somehow they got the point across.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.529
And here's what she says in verse 13.

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:22.529
You must spare the lives of my father and mother,

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:28.290
my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.290
And you must save us from death.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:32.649
What's she asking for?

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:37.649
She's asking for an exception.

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:39.649
There's a rule.

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:43.649
You must not make any covenant with them.

00:06:43.649 --> 00:06:47.649
You must not show them any favor.

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:49.649
And she's asking for an exception,

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:51.649
and quite a broad exception.

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:53.649
She's asking not just for her own life,

00:06:53.649 --> 00:06:58.649
but for the lives of all of her family members, as well some,

00:06:58.649 --> 00:07:01.649
might have thought that she was pushing it.

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:03.970
But she asked for that.

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.649
And the spies showed favor to Rahab.

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:10.290
They made an exception.

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:12.730
And they promised that when the time came,

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:16.129
a Rahab and her family would be spared.

00:07:17.649 --> 00:07:20.370
The Bible doesn't criticize the spies

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.449
for making that exception.

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:24.889
So it may be that Jehovah had something to do with it.

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:27.730
Maybe Jehovah moved the spies in that direction.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.930
Maybe Jehovah saw something in Rahab

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.490
that he wanted to save.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:36.689
Now later on, Joshua and the elders,

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:38.889
they didn't follow instructions,

00:07:38.889 --> 00:07:40.970
and they made a covenant with the Ghiblianites.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:42.810
And the Bible does mention that,

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:46.170
but it doesn't mention this when it comes to the spies here.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:47.370
They made the exception,

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:51.089
and we do know that Jehovah agreed with that exception.

00:07:51.089 --> 00:07:52.889
How do we know that?

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:57.170
Because when he made the walls of Jericho fall,

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:59.689
he preserved the section of the wall

00:07:59.689 --> 00:08:03.490
where Rahab's family lived.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:08.490
Jehovah agreed to an exception to his perfect rule.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.449
Now you know where I'm going with this.

00:08:14.449 --> 00:08:15.529
We need rules.

00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:20.610
And most of the time a rule will satisfy our needs.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:23.889
But in a few cases, it only makes sense

00:08:23.889 --> 00:08:27.410
to make an exception to the rule.

00:08:27.449 --> 00:08:29.970
I'm reminded of the time not too long ago

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:32.649
when the Bethel family moved out of Brooklyn.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:35.049
Now there were a lot of Bethelites

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:37.169
in the congregations who were elders

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:38.649
and ministerial servants,

00:08:38.649 --> 00:08:42.529
and so a massive reorganization of congregations

00:08:42.529 --> 00:08:45.370
was necessary in New York City.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:48.210
And the elders and the circuit overseers

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:50.169
had to make sure that each congregation

00:08:50.169 --> 00:08:52.929
had a balanced number of elders, ministerial servants

00:08:52.929 --> 00:08:56.690
and publishers, and so publishers were assigned

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:57.970
to various congregations.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.649
Can you imagine hundreds of thousands of assignments

00:09:01.649 --> 00:09:02.490
that had to be made?

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.490
And so there was a rule,

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:06.250
and it was a pretty good rule,

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:10.250
and the rule was, go where you're assigned.

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:14.450
We don't have time to consider the personal feelings

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.850
about every publisher in New York City,

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:19.649
so please go where you're assigned.

00:09:19.649 --> 00:09:20.610
That was the rule.

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:25.730
Now there were two sisters, single sisters,

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:27.490
who were assigned to a congregation.

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:30.769
They didn't have a car,

00:09:30.769 --> 00:09:32.809
and you couldn't reach the congregation

00:09:32.809 --> 00:09:36.129
they were assigned to by public transportation.

00:09:36.129 --> 00:09:40.529
And so they were going to have to walk to the kingdom hall,

00:09:40.529 --> 00:09:43.210
and the area where the kingdom hall was located

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:45.409
was very dangerous.

00:09:46.529 --> 00:09:48.970
Their safety would have been involved.

00:09:49.929 --> 00:09:54.330
Well, you had a rule, go where you're assigned,

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:58.889
but the circuit overseer lovingly made an exception.

00:09:58.889 --> 00:10:01.929
So the point is, we do need rules.

00:10:03.009 --> 00:10:06.769
And most of the time, our rules, even our imperfect rules,

00:10:06.769 --> 00:10:11.769
will serve most of the brothers, but let's use common sense.

00:10:11.769 --> 00:10:15.690
And there are times when we have to consider an exception.

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:19.210
Now can you think of anyone who was grateful

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:22.169
that Jehovah made an exception for Rahab,

00:10:22.169 --> 00:10:24.490
and she didn't die a Jericho?

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:25.889
Can you think of someone?

00:10:25.889 --> 00:10:30.889
He was mentioned in this program, Boaz, the husband of Ruth.

00:10:32.049 --> 00:10:34.090
Rahab was his mother.

00:10:35.809 --> 00:10:40.809
And think of this, if Rahab had died in Jericho,

00:10:41.049 --> 00:10:44.250
would there ever have been a David?

00:10:45.409 --> 00:10:46.250
Let's go on.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.850
Jehovah directed that seven nations in Canaan

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.809
were to be eliminated.

00:10:52.809 --> 00:10:55.850
And the Ghiblianites were among them, but they had a plan.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:58.889
They pretended to be from a far off nation

00:10:58.889 --> 00:11:01.649
that wasn't slated for destruction.

00:11:01.649 --> 00:11:04.210
And so the elders, not consulting Jehovah,

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:08.850
they made a vow that the Ghiblianites would be spared.

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:10.850
They made a covenant with the Ghiblianites.

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:14.049
Well, it wasn't long, but what the Israelites realized

00:11:14.049 --> 00:11:15.809
they'd been tricked.

00:11:15.809 --> 00:11:18.129
But even though their oath had been obtained

00:11:18.129 --> 00:11:20.129
under false pretenses,

00:11:20.169 --> 00:11:21.730
they agreed to keep their word.

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.210
But it's what happens next that's interesting.

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:29.649
Five kings of the Amorites find out that the Israelites

00:11:29.649 --> 00:11:31.529
and the Ghiblianites have made a covenant,

00:11:31.529 --> 00:11:33.610
and they are furious.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:38.649
And so they are determined to kill all the Ghiblianites,

00:11:38.649 --> 00:11:43.169
which was really what Jehovah had intended in the first place.

00:11:44.169 --> 00:11:46.009
What did Jehovah do?

00:11:46.009 --> 00:11:48.769
He could have said, well, that solves your problem.

00:11:48.809 --> 00:11:50.809
You promised the Ghiblianites that you

00:11:50.809 --> 00:11:51.850
wouldn't put them to death,

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:54.570
so you can sit back and let the Amorites through the job.

00:11:55.809 --> 00:11:58.289
But what did Jehovah do?

00:11:58.289 --> 00:12:04.100
Joshua chapter 10 and verse eight.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.899
Now remember, he had had a rule.

00:12:07.259 --> 00:12:10.139
It had a rule that everyone was to be destroyed.

00:12:10.139 --> 00:12:16.529
Joshua chapter 10 and verse eight.

00:12:16.529 --> 00:12:19.250
Jehovah then said to Joshua,

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:21.250
do not be afraid of them.

00:12:21.289 --> 00:12:24.169
For I have handed them over to you.

00:12:24.169 --> 00:12:28.929
Not one of them will be able to stand against you.

00:12:30.049 --> 00:12:31.649
Imagine this humility.

00:12:32.769 --> 00:12:37.210
Jehovah helps the Israelites to keep a promise

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:40.129
they had no business making.

00:12:40.129 --> 00:12:42.250
That is humility.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:44.169
Well, let's talk about Jesus apostles.

00:12:44.169 --> 00:12:47.649
We can really learn humility from them as well.

00:12:47.649 --> 00:12:50.289
Now we often talk about the disputes they had,

00:12:50.289 --> 00:12:53.009
but mostly that was before Pentecost.

00:12:53.009 --> 00:12:54.850
When you think about it, after Pentecost,

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:56.850
it was a different story.

00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:00.330
What do we find about the apostles after Pentecost?

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:03.330
Well, they weren't interested in taking credit for things

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.330
and they weren't searching for the limelight.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:10.330
They were really a very self-effacing the apostles.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:14.250
Matthew wrote the first inspired book,

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:17.490
the first inspired history of Jesus Christ.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:21.169
Do we see Matthew's picture on every other page?

00:13:21.169 --> 00:13:23.009
Matthew giving a public talk.

00:13:23.009 --> 00:13:24.970
Matthew performing a miracle.

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:26.769
Matthew shepherding.

00:13:26.769 --> 00:13:28.090
No.

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:31.289
His name is only mentioned twice in the whole gospel.

00:13:31.289 --> 00:13:36.129
And both times, he describes himself as a tax collector,

00:13:36.129 --> 00:13:39.129
not a very flattering portrayal.

00:13:39.129 --> 00:13:41.490
And what about the apostle John?

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:45.970
The name John appears 23 times in his gospel,

00:13:46.769 --> 00:13:51.610
but it never refers to the apostle John.

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:55.409
It almost always refers to John the Baptist.

00:13:55.409 --> 00:13:57.210
When the apostles and older men met

00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:59.009
to consider the matter of circumcision,

00:13:59.009 --> 00:14:00.929
was that an important meeting?

00:14:00.929 --> 00:14:04.250
Would you agree that that was a landmark meeting?

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:08.649
The apostles and older men are there who presided.

00:14:08.649 --> 00:14:12.370
Which of the twelve was jockeying for position?

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:13.970
James, the brother of Jesus,

00:14:14.049 --> 00:14:15.450
not he wasn't even an apostle.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:17.009
He's the one who presided.

00:14:18.009 --> 00:14:22.169
And then later on when the decision was made,

00:14:22.169 --> 00:14:24.370
who announced the decision?

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:27.649
Again, James, you don't find Peter or John saying,

00:14:27.649 --> 00:14:29.570
well, you know, this is a pretty important decision.

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:32.610
We think that one of us should announce it.

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:36.809
The apostles had learned their lesson.

00:14:38.009 --> 00:14:41.169
Well, remember that when the circuit overseer visits.

00:14:41.169 --> 00:14:44.610
Now you may have heavy responsibilities at Bethel.

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.009
But when he visits the congregation,

00:14:47.009 --> 00:14:48.730
he's in charge that week.

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:51.409
Follow his direction.

00:14:51.409 --> 00:14:54.210
Don't be critical of the circuit overseer.

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:55.690
And don't be afraid to let him know

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:58.009
how much you appreciate his service.

00:14:58.009 --> 00:15:00.649
And you know, our Bethel families here in the United States

00:15:00.649 --> 00:15:02.690
are such a wonderful example of that.

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:05.809
When the circuit overseers first visit a Bethel congregation,

00:15:05.809 --> 00:15:09.090
they're a little bit nervous for about 10 minutes.

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:14.850
But the Bethel family shows that they appreciate so much

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:16.090
the council.

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:19.490
And sometimes they talk about the circuit overseer's council

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:21.570
for weeks after his visit.

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:26.090
They really, deeply appreciate the visit of the circuit overseer

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:28.090
and they respect that man.

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:30.490
And we know that you're going to do the same.

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:35.169
Humble people are happy to contribute to the kingdom work

00:15:35.169 --> 00:15:38.009
any way they can, just so they can contribute.

00:15:38.009 --> 00:15:40.090
They're not hung up on privileges.

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:44.250
They're not hung up on prestige or on position.

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.929
They don't seek the limelight.

00:15:46.929 --> 00:15:48.730
And in this regard, we're going to talk a little bit

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:50.690
about the Apostle Paul.

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:53.850
Now, Brother Lippold mentioned in his talk that Paul

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:55.889
was not a man to boast.

00:15:55.889 --> 00:15:57.289
And that's quite true.

00:15:57.289 --> 00:16:00.889
Actually, Paul was a very humble man.

00:16:00.889 --> 00:16:02.330
Now think about this.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:07.009
At the time, Paul was converted about 34 CE.

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.889
Jesus told Ananias that Paul was going to have

00:16:11.889 --> 00:16:13.850
a wonderful privilege.

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:15.250
Let's read about it.

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:22.620
Acts chapter 9, Acts chapter 9 and verse 15, Acts 9 and 15.

00:16:32.539 --> 00:16:36.860
And this is Jesus to Ananias, but the Lord said to him,

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:41.860
go, because this man is a chosen vessel to me,

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.860
to bear my name to the nations, as well as to kings

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:51.779
and to the sons of Israel, a chosen vessel.

00:16:51.779 --> 00:16:53.860
How about that?

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:55.980
How did Paul react?

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.299
Did he let that go to his head?

00:16:58.299 --> 00:17:01.059
Did he immediately go up to Jerusalem and volunteer

00:17:01.059 --> 00:17:03.220
to be on the governing body, saying, well, now that I'm

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:06.579
anointed, I can be on the governing body?

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:07.380
No.

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:10.019
He stayed where he was in Damascus,

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.900
and he kept preaching the good news.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:18.059
Now in 36 CE, he did go up to world headquarters in Jerusalem.

00:17:18.059 --> 00:17:20.220
And how did he react?

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:23.180
Did he say, here I am, the chosen vessel.

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:26.869
I'm here to help you run the place.

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:29.230
He stayed with the Apostle Peter for a couple of weeks.

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:34.869
Apparently, Peter had moved to Jerusalem, but he kept preaching.

00:17:34.869 --> 00:17:38.990
He just put his head to the ground and he kept preaching

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:44.029
the good news until one day Jesus appeared to him

00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:46.470
when Paul was in the temple.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:51.309
And he told Paul that he had to leave Jerusalem immediately

00:17:51.309 --> 00:17:54.829
because the Jews were out to kill him.

00:17:54.829 --> 00:17:56.710
How did Paul react?

00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:01.190
Did he say, but the governing body is going to meet me?

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:04.910
If I leave, how will they manage without me?

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:07.349
They need my wisdom.

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:11.150
Paul obeyed theocratic direction.

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:12.910
And he left.

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:16.029
He accepted a new assignment.

00:18:16.029 --> 00:18:19.140
Tarsus.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.900
Tarsus.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:25.019
What kind of assignment is that for a chosen vessel?

00:18:25.019 --> 00:18:27.420
It was out in the boondocks.

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:32.539
It was 500 miles from the governing body in Jerusalem.

00:18:32.539 --> 00:18:36.539
How would the governing body get to know his wonderful qualities

00:18:36.539 --> 00:18:40.140
if he was 500 miles from Jerusalem?

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:44.900
Paul went to Tarsus and he kept preaching.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.299
We don't even know if there was a congregation of Tarsus

00:18:47.299 --> 00:18:51.500
when Paul got there, but Paul kept preaching.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:55.019
I was thinking of the lovely interview we just heard

00:18:55.019 --> 00:18:57.660
where the brother talked about how he eventually ended up

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.019
in the circuit work.

00:18:59.019 --> 00:19:04.259
But before that time, Jehovah gave him a little training.

00:19:04.299 --> 00:19:07.220
And perhaps that's what happened to the Apostle Paul.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:11.980
Do you know that Paul may have remained in Tarsus

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:16.460
for eight years preaching?

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:20.900
And then Barnabas came along.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.619
11 years after Paul's conversion,

00:19:23.619 --> 00:19:27.660
Barnabas came along and invited him to Antioch.

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:31.779
And for that time, Paul started to have privileges.

00:19:31.779 --> 00:19:37.460
And five years after that, Paul wrote his first inspired letter

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:40.420
that we cherish to this day.

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:42.619
Paul worked hard all his life.

00:19:42.619 --> 00:19:45.819
He did more than any of the twelve apostles,

00:19:45.819 --> 00:19:49.619
but he was never upset that he wasn't counted among them.

00:19:49.619 --> 00:19:54.339
Paul appreciated the privileges he had.

00:19:54.339 --> 00:19:56.660
He viewed them as undeserved kindness,

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.420
and we know that your brothers and sisters

00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:59.900
are going to do the same.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:03.579
Are you invited to conduct a meeting for Field Service?

00:20:03.579 --> 00:20:05.259
Treasure the privilege.

00:20:05.259 --> 00:20:07.339
Any privilege that you receive,

00:20:07.339 --> 00:20:12.539
treasure it, has an expression of love from Jehovah.

00:20:12.539 --> 00:20:15.220
Well, when you go to your assignments,

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:19.220
many situations are going to test your humility.

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.460
And I know that your brothers and sisters

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.059
are going to pass the test.

00:20:24.059 --> 00:20:26.940
The branch asks you to work on a project.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:30.019
And deep down, you don't quite agree with it.

00:20:30.019 --> 00:20:32.819
Deep down, you really wonder if it's going to work.

00:20:32.819 --> 00:20:36.380
And you wonder if it's not going to be a waste of your time.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.859
But you're not going to put it on the back burner

00:20:38.859 --> 00:20:41.740
and say, well, I'll get to it someday if I get time.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.380
You're not going to do that.

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.539
You're going to put heart and soul into the project.

00:20:46.539 --> 00:20:50.740
You're going to pray to Jehovah to bless the project,

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:56.019
the project that you didn't quite agree with.

00:20:56.099 --> 00:20:59.019
Or if you're asked to make a recommendation,

00:20:59.019 --> 00:21:04.380
and you favor one option over another, humility

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:07.619
is going to move you to present all of the options,

00:21:07.619 --> 00:21:10.339
all of the pros and cons equally.

00:21:10.339 --> 00:21:13.500
You're not going to slant things, thinking, well, you know,

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.259
I'm going to have to help these brothers

00:21:15.259 --> 00:21:16.380
to make this decision.

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:19.420
So I'll put a really heavy weight on the pros,

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.539
and I'm going to make it really light on the cons.

00:21:21.539 --> 00:21:22.980
Don't do that.

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:25.579
I know that you're going to present everything, honestly.

00:21:25.579 --> 00:21:27.019
And you're going to recognize that it's

00:21:27.019 --> 00:21:32.140
the Holy Spirit that helps brothers to make decisions.

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:34.859
Trust the Spirit to move the brothers,

00:21:34.859 --> 00:21:37.019
to do the right thing.

00:21:37.019 --> 00:21:39.980
Suppose you sisters are working on a team,

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:43.380
or you brothers are working on a body of elders.

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:46.940
I know that not even in your heart of hearts,

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:49.140
you're going to think that you have the best judgment

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:53.019
on the team, and that, well, you can listen politely

00:21:53.019 --> 00:21:54.579
to the expressions of others.

00:21:54.579 --> 00:21:57.900
But really, yours is the only sensible conclusion.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.819
And we hope that the brothers and sisters

00:21:59.819 --> 00:22:02.220
are going to go along with us.

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:05.380
You're not going to think that because nobody's right

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.539
all the time.

00:22:07.539 --> 00:22:12.099
Jehovah's Spirit can work on any member of the team.

00:22:12.099 --> 00:22:13.619
Don't get discouraged.

00:22:13.619 --> 00:22:16.940
If every suggestion you make in a meeting,

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:18.779
get shot down.

00:22:18.779 --> 00:22:21.140
It happens to the best of us.

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:22.859
And there will be other meetings.

00:22:23.019 --> 00:22:26.460
And hopefully, some of them will go better for you.

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:27.819
Don't get discouraged.

00:22:27.819 --> 00:22:30.220
And don't decide, well, I'm not going to say anything anymore.

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.460
I'm not going to contribute anymore.

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:33.819
Be humble.

00:22:33.819 --> 00:22:37.940
And recognize that at times, we may make suggestions

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:41.140
that don't make very much sense.

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:44.059
I certainly appreciate the kind way

00:22:44.059 --> 00:22:45.619
the governing body deals with me

00:22:45.619 --> 00:22:49.740
with some of my lame brain suggestions.

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.420
In your comments and your assignments

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.859
on the midweek meeting, use the knowledge

00:22:53.859 --> 00:22:57.019
you've gained at Gellied to build up.

00:22:57.019 --> 00:23:00.619
And I know you won't proofread the meetings.

00:23:00.619 --> 00:23:03.259
I don't think that was a good illustration.

00:23:03.259 --> 00:23:05.579
That scripture wasn't applied right.

00:23:05.579 --> 00:23:07.140
That isn't the right word.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:08.660
You won't do that.

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:12.299
Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the meetings.

00:23:12.299 --> 00:23:14.380
Take in the spiritual food.

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:17.299
Rejoice in whatever the brothers and sisters

00:23:17.299 --> 00:23:21.000
have prepared for you.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.240
Well, I haven't told you anything.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:26.960
You don't already know you're all humble people.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:31.039
These are just reminders that all of us need.

00:23:31.039 --> 00:23:35.359
All of us are humble most of the time.

00:23:35.359 --> 00:23:39.359
We pray for the day when we'll be humble all of the time.

00:23:39.359 --> 00:23:43.960
And in the meantime, let's work on it, you and I.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.240
Let's work on it together.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.039
Let's follow the course of humility.

00:23:49.039 --> 00:23:55.160
If we do, we'll continue to be used by Jehovah.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.079
We love you.

00:23:57.079 --> 00:23:59.279
May Jehovah bless you richly.
