00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:04.030
So what do you think?

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.450
What are the steps of love?

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:09.390
There are three

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.550
step one love of God

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:14.669
step two love of

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:20.989
neighbor and step three love of self now of course

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:24.750
We're not talking about the selfish self-centered attitude that people have today

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.989
We all need a measure of self-worth

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.670
Self-respect if we're to take a picture of these steps they would look something like

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.270
this

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:38.950
Make sense that the highest step and the first love of God and

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.270
The lowest and the third step love of self because according to the love of the Christ

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.350
We ought to love our neighbor more than self because we ought to be willing to die for a neighbor

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:54.070
For the sake of this talk will focus on step three

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.310
reason being

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.310
though the lowest

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.030
for some

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.030
It may be the hardest to climb

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:04.590
Because of lack of self-esteem

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.150
The question to use this

00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:09.349
How can we help others

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.030
build or boost their self-esteem? What do you think?

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:21.670
By imitating Christ what did he do? He gave love to others in three ways by being encouraging

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.909
by

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.909
caring and by trusting

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:30.230
One example of Jesus being encouraging is found at Luke chapter 10

00:01:30.629 --> 00:01:36.870
So please follow with me look chapter 10 and there as we glance down to verse 27

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:44.109
We have a man verse in the law and there he clearly identified the three steps according to the law of

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.870
Moses

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.709
the mosaic love but note the encouragement Jesus gave him in verse 28

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.430
Verse 28 Luke 10 28

00:01:56.269 --> 00:01:58.269
Jesus he said to him

00:01:58.269 --> 00:02:00.269
You answered correctly

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:05.989
Keep doing this or keep giving love keep showing love and you will get life

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.030
What's the lesson for us?

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:11.669
We want to be quick

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:13.669
To give yes commendation

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:16.189
But also motivation

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.909
One watchtower said this is said watchtower said at this point in the wasteful life

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:25.310
Our brothers, they don't need critics. There's enough critics in the world

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:33.990
But they need friends to help them reach the finish line at Luke chapter 18

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.629
We have an example of Jesus being

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.870
caring showing tender loving care so look 18 and the context looks at look 18

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:53.150
Well, it's close to spring 33 Jesus is on his way is on a mission going to Jerusalem to observe his last Passover and

00:02:53.469 --> 00:03:03.389
They're in verse 35 look 18. I'm sure you remember that the context look 18 is near Jericho and Jericho to Jerusalem is a day's journey

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:09.389
And there look 18 35 near Jericho does a blind man

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:12.229
Sitting beside the road begging

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:15.909
What did Jesus do for this man?

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:19.069
Please scroll down to verse 40

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:21.629
Verse 40 look 18 verse 40

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.710
Jesus cared enough to stop is on a mission, but he

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.590
stopped

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:30.789
Verse 41

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:38.469
He cared enough to show personal interest. You know this is a question. Just ask the man. What do you want me to do for you?

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:45.030
And you we can try to picture imagine the tone of voice of Jesus. What do you want me to do for you?

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:49.590
Let's think about this love it. Is that possible? Jesus could see the man was blind

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:57.030
Probably so why the question probably is to take in consideration his feelings

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.229
What do you need? What do you want and interestingly in verse 39

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.789
Verse 39 the crowd was trying to keep this man quiet

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.310
But now in verse 41

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:12.189
Jesus speak to me

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:14.389
What do you want? What do you mean? How can I help you?

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.589
personal interest and

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:23.310
To drive home the lesson of this account. Here's a verified experience a

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:33.430
Brother took his nephew 13 year old to visit Bethel and at the time the nephew was going through family turmoil to the point that

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.790
It caused him to lack motivation

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:38.029
So as it ring Bethel a Bethel light

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:46.160
Stop and take a few minutes to show personal interest

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.920
the result

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.360
At the very next assembly the 13 year old got baptized

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.360
Two years later at 15 he started regular pioneer

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.839
At 17 was appointed the mr.al servant

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:03.680
Now as 19 you put in his application for Bethel

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:06.839
All of this because someone

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.560
stopped and

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:11.959
personal interest

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:18.629
Can you think of an example Jesus shunned trust to others?

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.269
Well, let's go to look this time look

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.350
30 not 32 22 look 22 and

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.990
As we look at verse 34 look 22 verse 34

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:38.629
It's when Jesus we mind it or we for war and not we mind it for Warren Peter

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.629
That he would

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:48.269
Deny him three times now. Let's pause there at that moment when Peter denied his master three times

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:51.430
What do you think was his level of self worth?

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:58.790
Yeah, at an all-time low would have been so easy for Peter to just give up never get back up

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.750
But what helped him to climb back on to step three

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.509
Probably what Jesus told him in the verse 32

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:13.990
Look at the latter part of verse thirty thirty two will focus on four words. You notice

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.750
once you have returned

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:19.589
once you have returned

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:25.509
And probably with these words may I get bringing in Peter's ears as he was down and out

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:30.829
Slowly getting back up once you have returned because Jesus is expressing what fear?

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.550
Expressing confidence

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:38.709
Yes, you will fall, but you will get back to step three, but not only that

00:06:38.709 --> 00:06:42.790
Hey, don't forget step two because you notice the latter part of verse thirty thirty two

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.110
once you have returned what's a mission?

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.910
strengthen and

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:52.230
The Greek word little mean make firm your brothers

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:58.100
love

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.060
Is eager to believe the best in others?

00:07:02.579 --> 00:07:03.740
love

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.329
It's trusting so what could be the result?

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:13.689
As we help others to boost their self-esteem. Well, let's go back to our image

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:18.490
What could be the result? Well as you climb up to step three you agree?

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.449
It makes it a little bit easier to go on to step two love of others

00:07:22.089 --> 00:07:23.689
or love of neighbor

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:31.050
Which is a prerequisite for love of God step one. What did a possible John said?

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.209
What did he say? Well, we cannot say we love God if we don't love our

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:39.560
Our neighbor

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:45.160
Having attended Gilead so you heard the fine talk about it gently. What is expected of you?

00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:49.589
To strengthen and stabilize

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.300
The organization

00:07:53.459 --> 00:07:57.220
It has been said this can be done one publisher at a time

00:07:57.939 --> 00:08:01.300
And that reminds me about ten years ago actually ten years ago

00:08:01.459 --> 00:08:03.779
My wife and I were transferred from Canada to Congo

00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:09.459
And I'll never forget what a friend told me said you know what the friends in Congo. They don't need another messiah

00:08:10.339 --> 00:08:15.939
Trust me. They don't all they need

00:08:17.779 --> 00:08:19.779
Is love

00:08:20.019 --> 00:08:21.779
So

00:08:21.779 --> 00:08:23.779
Keep on loving

00:08:24.339 --> 00:08:27.939
As Jesus taught us by being encouraging

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.980
By caring

00:08:31.139 --> 00:08:33.139
By trusting

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.620
And the friends

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:41.940
Will give you love back in return make your hover help you to do just that. Yes, we love you
