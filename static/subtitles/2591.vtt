00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:10.529
Oh, most definitely I felt awkward.

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:13.410
I didn't wear my clothes a certain way,

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.330
or I didn't hide my hair,

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.170
kept a certain way.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.570
I didn't wear this latest shoes.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.210
It can be really easy to get cut up on social media

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.129
and trying to see what the new trends were,

00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:26.289
trying to see how others look.

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:27.969
Should I look like that?

00:00:27.969 --> 00:00:29.089
Why don't I look like that?

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:30.370
What can I do to look like that?

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.170
And I paid such a high price for the body I was going after.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.810
I was going after unrealistic beauty standards.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.729
It led me to being diagnosed with an eating disorder.

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:47.729
I'm focusing on my parents too much affected me spiritually,

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:49.729
even though I was in service,

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:51.969
even though I was in meeting,

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.049
even though I was present for family worship.

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:56.210
I wasn't focused.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.009
I was thinking more of what I'm going to wear tomorrow.

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:01.649
My parents were a great help.

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.769
They took time to actually listen to my feelings

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:07.090
and what I was going through.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.890
It was not necessarily any formal setting.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.370
It was actually in informal settings

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.090
where we can be in the car and we're just talking

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.650
or we're sitting on the couch watching TV

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.810
and my dad would just talk to me

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.049
and kind of see how I was doing, how my day went.

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.609
My father, he kind of sat me down

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:28.370
and he shared two really important scriptures with me

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.010
in first piece of three, three and four,

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.969
which says, do not let your abdomen be external.

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.890
And you don't want to focus too much on

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.689
how you look on the outer parents.

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:42.209
And the reason being,

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:45.090
is found in Proverbs 31-30 where it says,

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.769
beauty may be fleeting.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.370
So even though we may put so much effort

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.010
into how we look on the outer parents,

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.930
eventually that's going to go away.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.530
Something that has really helped me

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.969
is giving myself time and the day to get off of social media,

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:05.569
get off the internet,

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:08.370
and giving time, dedicate time to Jehovah.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.090
I own followed models and influencers

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.330
that made me feel more insecure by myself

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.930
and I would study Bible characters of the past

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.810
such as Abigail, Sarah, Ruth,

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.090
letting myself be influenced by them

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.449
was a game changer for me.

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:31.889
What made them more beautiful to the eyes of Jehovah

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:33.169
were their qualities,

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:36.050
how they treated others, their personality,

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.050
how they search Jehovah with loyalty.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.050
As I examine those scriptures,

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.370
I feel like something clicked in my hair

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.090
being attractive physically,

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.129
it just didn't really make much of a difference to me anymore.

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.610
Making sure I prayed before my day started,

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.610
I learned to really let Jehovah in

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.849
and make my prayers meaningful.

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:00.370
There were a few elders,

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.370
some even became almost as close as best friends to me.

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:08.930
The elders really helped me when it came to

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.770
how I could take more attention off of me,

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.009
how I could focus on helping others.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.090
Knowing that I'm making Jehovah happy

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.409
by helping others get to know him

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:25.090
and making disciples is what makes me happy now.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.129
And as a pioneer, I finally was able to attend

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.650
my first Pioneer School in March of 2021,

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.289
which was an amazing blessing from Jehovah.

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:37.569
I work on being more open to people,

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.330
being more present, being more available.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.870
And trust me, it paid off for me because eventually,

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.629
I received much more privileges in the congregation.

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:57.469
I was able to serve in different capacities

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:00.590
in Jehovah's organization and above all,

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:03.469
I was more up here.
