00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.100
Good morning.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.100
Good morning.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.099
My name is Ted and this is Dan.

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:10.060
We've been talking briefly to people in the neighborhood about Jesus.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.419
Something he was just a good man.

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:14.699
Others feel he was the Messiah.

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:17.660
Still others believe that he never existed.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.940
What's your opinion regarding Jesus?

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.100
Actually my wife and I are getting ready to go visit our daughter in the hospital.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.379
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:00:27.379 --> 00:00:28.739
May we help with anything?

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:31.260
I can't think of anything but thanks.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.100
She had surgery last week.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:40.060
She has been recovering well, but the family has been with her each day since then.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.740
The householder is going to visit his daughter in the hospital.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.460
I want to read him something from God's word before I go.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.780
Which verse should I read?

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.179
I could read Matthew 16-16 to make a point about Jesus.

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:59.140
It says, you are the Christ, the Son of the living God.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.459
Or I could read Acts 24-15 that talks about the resurrection.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:08.900
I have hoped toward God that there is going to be a resurrection.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:16.219
Or I could share Isaiah 33-24 about the end to all sickness and no resident will say, I

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:18.180
am sick.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.140
Which verse would be appropriate in this situation?

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.019
Once you're on your way out, I don't want to keep you out the door.

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:31.060
But before I go, I'd like to share with you an encouraging promise from God's word.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.060
Okay.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.859
It's here at Isaiah 33-24.

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:43.180
It says, and no resident will say, I am sick.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.219
Wouldn't it be nice to live at a time when there's no more sickness and no need for hospitals?

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:51.019
Yeah, that would be nice.

00:01:51.019 --> 00:01:52.019
See you and we see you again.

00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:53.019
We can discuss that.

00:01:53.019 --> 00:01:54.019
Sure.

00:01:54.019 --> 00:01:54.420
Sounds good.
