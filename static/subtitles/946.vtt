00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:08.939
I prayed to Jehovah, if it is your will, I would be happy to enter Pioneer Service.

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:15.570
But I had to work really hard to provide for the needs of my family, because my father

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.219
had died when he was 45 years old.

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:25.480
The elder I talked to gave me advice not to be picky on what kind of job I would have.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:32.240
He reminded me of Matthew 633 and told me not to be overly anxious.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.920
Because of our good communication within the family, we were able to find solutions.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.240
My of the siblings realized that they also shared responsibility in providing for the needs

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.920
of the family.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.520
After one year of pioneering, I was encouraged to apply for Bethel Service.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.640
And now I am in Bethel.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:03.359
I feel that Jehovah really cares for me, loves me, and appreciates all my efforts.

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:10.439
Because they love me, my cousins pressured me to choose a secular career.

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.120
If I went against their wishes, it would hurt them and put a strain on our relationship.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.799
I was really anxious.

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:25.000
I wanted to show my trust in Jehovah by pioneering and give him an opportunity to show me that I

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.810
can be happy in his service.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:41.659
I tried to express my appreciation for my cousins by what I said and did, and showed them love.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.540
They realized that I have changed for the better.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.579
I show more concern for others now.

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:54.060
Now they understand that we have been learning good things, and that we have a happier and

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.650
more meaningful life.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.969
I wanted to try serving where the need was great.

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:06.329
When I first arrived, I thought it was so cool being there.

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.930
I had expected the poverty, but when I saw it, it hit home more than when I had expected.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.650
So then I started to feel really homesick.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.129
But my brothers and sisters, I'd go to the Kingdom Hall, and they were able to cope with

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.849
the challenges that they were facing because they had Jehovah in their life.

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:29.050
So that, their example really helped me to see that my circumstances don't need to change

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.409
from my attitude to change.

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:38.210
Proverbs 15, 15 stood out to me, but having a cheerful heart and being able to have a

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:45.930
continual feast, no matter what my circumstances are, and I found an article about that scripture.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.650
And so from there I decided to ask myself, how can I use my situation and what I'm learning

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.490
to help others, and got to start helping with foreign language group there?

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:03.490
That whole experience just made my love for people grow so much and definitely changed

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.009
my life.
