00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:12.619
A road for racing, bicycle racing against my rivals down a road.

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:17.620
A road I traveled just for myself.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:23.820
That was my life course.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:31.579
I started road bicycle racing when I was a university student.

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.579
I won practically every race in Japan.

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.579
I won the Japan National Championship twice.

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.579
And even participated in the Asian Games and the 1988 Soul Olympics.

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:57.670
Of course I was always happy when I won, but that happiness didn't last very long.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.670
Every time I won a race, I would be expected to win the next one.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.670
And I was overwhelmed with tremendous pressure.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.670
That frightened me, so I immersed myself in training.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.980
Train, race, train, race.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:29.129
I was racing down a road with no end in sight.

00:01:29.129 --> 00:01:35.939
After the Soul Olympics, I was devoted to practice.

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.939
It was then that my younger sister, Rie, who had become one of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.939
gave me the happiness book.

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:50.219
I really agreed with what that book said.

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:57.239
In 1989, I started to study the Bible seriously.

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:02.239
Even so, I just wasn't able to believe in the existence of a creator,

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:06.239
so I studied the creation book.

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:11.240
When I read about the structure of bird's wings, my eyes were opened.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.710
I thought, there is a creator.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.710
The creator made this.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:27.020
When I was convinced of the existence of the creator, I was able to understand the purpose of life.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.020
It's just as Ecclesiastes 12 says.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:39.539
The purpose of life is to know the creator and live for him.

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:42.539
I was so relieved.

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:49.539
In 1991, I dedicated my life to Jehovah and started on the creator's road.

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:54.659
The following year, I started pioneering.

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:58.659
And my sister and I moved to a congregation where the need was greater.

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:04.770
But later, I was found to have kidney cancer.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.770
And in 2005, I had to quit pioneering after 13 wonderful years.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.460
I was really discouraged.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.460
I could no longer do the things I had always done,

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.460
and it was difficult to keep myself respect.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:31.099
However, at that time, timely publications and encouragement from the elders gave me good support,

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:38.340
so I tried to find joy in what I could do.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.340
Later, I got my strength back to some extent,

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.340
and I started pioneering again in 2012.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.340
I was overjoyed to attend Pioneer Service School again.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.219
Jehovah really helped me to continue on this road.

00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:03.580
In this system, we think we have a lot of time in our lives,

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.580
but in reality, we don't.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:16.600
People should live thinking about what is really important in life in the time they have.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.600
Of course, we can learn from the things we experience.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.600
But the wise course is to learn from the truth and from our relationship with our creator.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.600
I really want young people to learn that lesson.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:41.339
The road with real value is not the one we take for ourselves.

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:45.339
It is the road we take for the creator.
