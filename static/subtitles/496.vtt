00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:08.689
Number 12-3, Moses was by far the meekest of all men.

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:12.689
Now, when we analyze our own personality,

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:16.690
how many of us zero in on meekness?

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.690
That might not be the first quality that comes to mind.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.690
We may think that it's a rather benign, innocent,

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.690
maybe even inconsequential.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:32.689
We think, you know, I have other bigger issues I need to deal with first.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.689
I need to work on being more courageous and partial,

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:38.689
loving, forgiving, discerning,

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:42.689
and a whole list of other qualities might come to mind.

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:48.689
Well, meekness might sound benign and inconsequential.

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:54.689
In reality, it is a very complex quality and quite diverse.

00:00:54.689 --> 00:01:05.120
A police find Exodus chapter 2 was Moses born meek, sweet, and complete?

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:12.400
No, there's no indication that meekness is an innate quality.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.400
Now, it's true at Exodus 2.2, it does say that when he was born, Moses was beautiful.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.400
But it does not say he was meek.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.400
And when you think about it, Moses was raised in the arrogant,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.400
haughty family of Pharaoh, the world renowned leader at that time.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.400
He was not taught to be meek during his adolescent years.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.400
So what do we learn thus far?

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.400
It's actually encouraging.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.400
We do not have to be born with meek genes or a predisposition to meekness

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.400
in order to attain that quality.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.400
And we don't have to have the perfect upbringing to cultivate meekness

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.400
with time and patience all of us can attain that quality.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.400
Now, Moses came described as by far, by far, the meekest of all men.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.400
He was in a category all by himself.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.400
Well, how did that happen?

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.400
Well, he was actually coached and trained personally by Jehovah.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.400
And Jehovah obviously saw the potential in Moses and some of those qualities

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.400
he might have developed in his upbringing in Pharaoh's house,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.400
dignity, confidence, sometimes overconfidence, poise.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.400
But all those acquired gifts Jehovah could not use him to his maximum potential

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.400
until until he cultivated meekness.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.400
And this was not a 40-day curriculum.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:53.400
It was a 40-year lesson of contemplation and cultivating humility.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.400
He was just a shepherd and not even of his own sheep.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.400
It was his father and my sheep.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.400
But with his changed situation and having some time on his hands,

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.400
he was now able to contemplate the type of man he was and the type of God he served.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.400
And he changed.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.400
He developed this quality of meekness.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.400
Now, the inside book describes meekness this way.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.400
And you'll see it is a complex quality.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.400
It says it's a madness of temper without hotiness or vanity.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.400
The mental disposition that enables one to endure injury with patience

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:40.400
and without irritation, resentment, or vindictive retaliation.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.400
Now, that's a tall order, isn't it?

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:52.400
You know, one watchtower described meekness as a piece of artwork painted by a skilled artist.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.400
Now, you look at the artwork there.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.400
It's beautiful.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:05.400
Moses' development of meekness was so beautiful to Jehovah that he was make sure it was put under the spotlight

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.400
by far the meekest of all men.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.400
Well, what's the point of similarity between a piece of artwork and meekness?

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.399
Well, the artist has to blend colors together, definitely skillfully,

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:24.399
a variety of colors come together.

00:04:24.399 --> 00:04:31.399
For example, of those three primary colors on a color where it's red, yellow, and blue.

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:37.399
Well, by mixing these colors together, an artist can paint a beautiful, tranquil painting.

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:43.399
And as you see in the image of the secondary colors, if you mix red and yellow together,

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:45.399
what color do you see between them?

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:46.399
It's orange.

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:49.399
If you mix yellow and blue together, what color do you see then?

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:51.399
You see green.

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:56.399
And if you mix red and blue together, it produces violet or purple.

00:04:56.399 --> 00:05:03.399
Well, the artist further mixes colors together and he can get all the hues necessary

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:07.399
to paint a beautiful, tranquil scene.

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:11.399
Well, what's the point of similarity?

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:13.399
Meekness is not one color.

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:15.399
It's not just one quality.

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:20.399
It's blending many different qualities together in a skilled fashion.

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:29.399
To achieve meekness, it requires we mix together various virtues like humility,

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:37.399
loneliness of mind, gentleness, patience, a mildness of temper, long suffering.

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:41.399
And like an artist, if we work on all those qualities simultaneously,

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:46.399
the result is this beautiful masterpiece that we call meekness.

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:49.399
Please turn out to Numbers 12.

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:53.399
We're going to reason on verse 3 from a different aspect.

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:55.399
And so there it is, verse 3 again.

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:59.399
The man Moses was by far the meekest of all men on the face of the earth.

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:03.870
So leave your Bible open there for a moment.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.870
Question, who wrote those words?

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.870
Well, those were Moses' own words.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:18.870
And so some commentators have criticized this saying that this was unjustified self-praise.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:24.870
Someone like a person who says of himself, I'm humble and I'm proud of it.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.870
Well, let's look at the context first here.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:34.339
Situation is described in Numbers 12, 1 and 2.

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:41.339
Moses's sister and brother challenged his authority as the official spokesman for Jehovah.

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:44.339
And Miriam was listed first in this mutiny.

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:48.339
She was the oldest of the three siblings. Moses was the youngest.

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:53.339
And it's apparent that Miriam was the instigator,

00:06:53.339 --> 00:07:00.339
because if he glanced down there in verse 10 of the two, she was the only one struck with leprosy.

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:10.339
And remember, meekness, the definition, part of it was, endure injury with patience without irritation, resentment, or retaliation.

00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:18.339
So Moses absorbed this withering, blistering, provocation, meekly.

00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:20.339
And now look at the end of verse 2.

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:23.339
But Jehovah was listening.

00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:25.339
So Jehovah was right there.

00:07:25.339 --> 00:07:30.339
He saw and heard the level of vehemence.

00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:35.339
Well, what was Moses' relationship with Jehovah, verse 8?

00:07:35.339 --> 00:07:39.339
Face to face, I speak to him openly, not by riddles.

00:07:39.339 --> 00:07:42.339
And the appearance of Jehovah is what he sees.

00:07:42.339 --> 00:07:46.339
Well, we understand, of course, that this was through an angel.

00:07:46.339 --> 00:07:52.339
But Moses had this two-way communication directly with Jehovah.

00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:55.339
In fact, inside had a significant statement, I thought, it said,

00:07:55.339 --> 00:08:05.339
that Moses had a more direct, constant, and intimate relationship with Jehovah than did any other prophet prior to Jesus Christ.

00:08:05.339 --> 00:08:09.339
Now that's quite a statement, isn't it? And think about it.

00:08:09.339 --> 00:08:14.339
When Jesus came, he superseded Moses' status.

00:08:14.339 --> 00:08:22.339
Because at that point, Jesus became by far the meekest man that ever walked the earth.

00:08:22.339 --> 00:08:27.339
But what did Jesus say about himself at Matthew 1129?

00:08:27.339 --> 00:08:32.340
He said, I'm mild-tempered and lowly of heart, meekness.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:37.340
Well, was that unjustified self-praise on his part?

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:41.340
No, it was unvarnished truth.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:45.340
And it's similar with Moses the way he described himself.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:51.340
It's true he penned the words, but we must never forget those were not his words.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:56.340
He was inspired by God. He was the meekest of all men.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:00.340
Was he perfect in this quality? No.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:06.340
We all recall the rash action on his part when he struck the rock to bring forth water

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:11.340
and the credit for the miracle he took away from Jehovah, applied to himself.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:16.340
Well, that was a huge mistake that Moses regretted for the rest of his life.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:22.340
And Jehovah took the insult seriously, did not allow him to enter the promised plan.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:26.340
But how did Jehovah view Moses after that?

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:32.799
I find Deuteronomy 3410.

00:09:32.799 --> 00:09:37.799
Moses was still viewed by Jehovah as the finest example of all men.

00:09:37.799 --> 00:09:42.799
And 3410 says, but there has never, again, arisen a prophet in Israel like Moses

00:09:42.799 --> 00:09:47.799
whom Jehovah knew face to face, complimentary lying about Moses.

00:09:47.799 --> 00:09:52.799
Who wrote Deuteronomy? Moses.

00:09:52.799 --> 00:09:56.799
But in this case, these were not his words pinned down.

00:09:56.799 --> 00:09:59.799
He had already died, you see, in verse 5 there.

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:05.799
And so, insight attributes these final inspired words of the book to Joshua,

00:10:05.799 --> 00:10:08.799
the writer of the next book of the Bible.

00:10:08.799 --> 00:10:17.799
So, meekness is a complex and beautiful quality that we can strive to more fully achieve.
