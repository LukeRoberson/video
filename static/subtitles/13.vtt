00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:07.599
Thank you for joining us for this JW Broadcasting special update on the situation of our brothers and Nepal.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.179
We have a video report to share on the disaster relief effort organized to provide for those affected by the recent

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:42.829
Devastating earthquake. The earthquake in Nepal on April 25th 2015 caused massive devastation in Kathmandu

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.750
the capital city and surrounding areas.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.670
Severe aftershocks brought on additional suffering.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.710
Our initial report to you was posted in the newsroom of JW.org.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.549
There we were saddened to tell you that one sister and her two children were killed in the disaster.

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:05.590
Also many of our brothers' homes were either destroyed or damaged.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.549
Note that you've been wondering how are they doing and what has happened since then.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:20.870
As always, Johova has provided the needed help spiritually, emotionally and physically by means of the organization and his Holy Spirit.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.469
It was my privilege to visit our brothers there just a few days after the initial earthquake.

00:01:27.269 --> 00:01:33.430
It was heartwarming to see how the practical relief assistance given to our brothers and sisters and others

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.870
has affected their lives during this stressful time.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.349
And most importantly, to observe how our brothers are experiencing in a special way,

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.670
the truth of God's promise at Isaiah 41-13.

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:55.269
For I, Johova your God, and grasping your right hand, the one saying to you,

00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:57.750
do not be afraid, I will help you.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.590
As you watch what has been done for our brothers and hear their heartfelt personal

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:10.789
expressions in the following report, we are confident that Johova's mighty hand helping his people.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:24.490
Home to the tallest peak in the world, Mount Everest. Located in the Himalayas, it is

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:32.969
bordered by China and India. As of today, Nepal is home to over 2,200 of our brothers and sisters

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:38.009
who zealously preach the Kingdom Good News to its more than 27 million residents.

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:45.930
Tragically, on April 25th, every day life for the people of Nepal changed.

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.129
A 7.8 magnitude earthquake shook the region of Nepal's capital, Kathmandu.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.099
Nepal's residents were now suffering the effects of the most powerful earthquake to hit that

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:22.789
region in over 80 years. We are caught by surprise by this event. We will not prepare for destruction

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:28.550
of this scale, but I am happy to say that our dear brothers and sisters are hoping this

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:37.270
situation will come in spirit and with Khunfei, Johova. 163 homes of our brothers were damaged,

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:45.479
91 of which were completely destroyed. As a result of the devastation, there was an acute

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:56.330
shortage of food, water and sanitary shelter. Within 24 hours, local brothers in less affected

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:02.969
areas and neighboring branch offices coordinated and began the distribution of relief supplies.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:31.610
A local disaster relief committee was formed and a medical team was dispatched to care for the

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:40.279
physical and emotional needs of those affected. Simultaneously, attention was given to providing

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.079
much needed spiritual comfort and encouragement. Immediately after the first

00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:50.439
tremor, elders of each congregation started to contact with each member of their congregation.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.439
Although there were frequent aftershocks, elders and other brothers personally went to the

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:59.879
house of each members who could not be reached over the phone.

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:07.319
Since the first tremor hit us and sat at the afternoons, we are staying in the tents.

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:14.120
The very next day elders visited us, they spoke with us, inquired about our situation.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.720
We are very encouraged. But we are not worried about losing and food,

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.480
a sister helped us. Within an hour, elders came to help and encouraged us.

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:31.240
They are visiting us daily. It's beautiful. We are happy. Thank you.

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:39.319
On May 1st, Brother Gary Broke, a representative of World Headquarters, arrived to build up those

00:05:39.319 --> 00:06:07.930
who had suffered losses. A highlight of the visit was a special meeting held on May 4th,

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.050
which was streamed via the internet from a kingdom halved to other congregations around the

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:22.779
country. All of this only nine days after the earthquake. It is very clear that Jehovah has provided

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:29.899
the needed help spiritually, mentally and physically through his organization and through his

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:37.019
Holy Spirit.
