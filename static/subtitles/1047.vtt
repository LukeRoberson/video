00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.519
There is no other organization that compares to Jehovah's organization.

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:11.519
Everything the organization provides and helps with is free of charge.

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:19.519
But Jehovah invites all of us to give to him or contribute our material resources according to what we personally decide.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.519
Now, why is this giving a matter of faith?

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.519
Could it be that we hold back because one,

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:33.520
we might fear that if we are generous, we might not have enough for our own needs.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.520
To think this way is understandable.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:43.520
Life is unpredictable and nobody knows what the future holds and what our material needs might be tomorrow.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.520
Or could it be that we hold back too?

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.520
Because we feel that our personal contribution is so small and therefore insignificant.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.520
Maybe we have very little material because we live in a poor country.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.520
Or we struggle to cover our expenses for other reasons.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.519
So we see that our giving really depends on how we connect this with Jehovah.

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:19.519
Our view of Jehovah, our friendship with Jehovah needs to influence our actions and this requires faith.

00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:28.519
Therefore, let us briefly look at these two concerns that might impact our generosity and how faith can help us.

00:01:28.519 --> 00:01:32.519
Now, the first concern was the uncertainty of our own future needs.

00:01:32.519 --> 00:01:37.519
Please let us open our Bible to 1 Corinthians 16.

00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:45.519
Here in our theme scripture, the Apostle Paul, provides a principle to follow when we consider donations.

00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:50.519
This is 1 Corinthians 16 and we read verse 2.

00:01:50.519 --> 00:02:01.519
On the first day of every week, each of you should set something aside according to his own means so that collections will not take place when I arrive.

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:06.519
So the Apostle Paul encouraged Christians to plan ahead to give.

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:14.520
In other words, Paul wanted them to consider their circumstances and to decide on a certain contribution amount.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.520
Paul was convinced but this would not result in their lacking material necessities.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:26.520
He himself had experienced the help from Jehovah and he knew that God would care for them.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.520
Generous giving would further allow Jehovah to care for them in a generous way.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.930
Do we now see how planning ahead is an expression of our faith?

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.930
When we do this, we are putting Jehovah to the test in a good way.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:53.930
We want to experience how it feels when Jehovah sees us setting the right priorities and in turn becomes our protector and our rewarder.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.930
Dear brothers and sisters, you are displaying this kind of faith.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.930
Many of you set something aside so that you can contribute when you come to the Kingdom Hall.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.930
Others consider their expenses and their financial means and they decide to regularly donate electronically.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.930
Even when circumstances have not allowed you to donate the way you've done in the past,

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.930
you still find a way to give your contribution to Jehovah.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.930
Jehovah promised to care for our needs.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.930
Do we really believe that?

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.930
If we do, our faith will help us to give generously.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.930
There was a second concern that might hold us back from giving generously.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:49.930
We might consider our circumstances and feel that the contribution we can make is so small that it makes no difference.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.930
Do you still have 1 Corinthians 16 verse 2 open?

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.930
What did we read there? Let us read it again.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.930
1 Corinthians 16 verse 2.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:10.210
On the first day of every week, each of you should set something aside according to his own means.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.209
Did you notice Paul did not specify a certain minimum amount?

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:26.209
And later, he mentioned that Macedonian Christians, they were in the poverty yet they backed for the privilege of giving.

00:04:26.209 --> 00:04:35.209
They were happy to give even beyond their means because they were giving to Jehovah.

00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:47.209
Being poor meant that they individually could not give much and yet they understood that giving materially is an expression of our worship.

00:04:47.209 --> 00:04:51.209
Many of you brothers and sisters are like those in Macedonia.

00:04:51.209 --> 00:05:00.209
You have very little and yet we see your faith by contributing generously according to your circumstances.

00:05:00.209 --> 00:05:04.209
No matter how small the amount might be.

00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:09.209
You imitate our generous God, Jehovah.

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:13.209
And you experience what one sister described in a letter.

00:05:13.209 --> 00:05:15.209
She wrote,

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:22.209
All these years I have been unable to give but small amounts of money at the kingdom hall.

00:05:22.209 --> 00:05:24.209
Yet she continued,

00:05:24.209 --> 00:05:34.980
Jehovah God has given me back much more than I have given.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:40.980
Even our young children can learn to set something aside and give to Jehovah.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:47.980
Here at Warwick, we occasionally receive notes and letters from these young ones who want to give to Jehovah.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:54.980
And they tell us how they appreciate what the organization is doing, especially the videos.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:01.980
This really touches our heart and we can only imagine how happy it must make Jehovah.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:08.389
Jehovah loves us for giving the best that we have.

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:12.389
He values even our small contributions.

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:18.389
Even smaller nations do make a difference and are noticed by Jehovah.

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:22.389
He sees our faith in action.

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:27.389
In the following video, note what moved one couple to greater acts of generosity.

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:42.389
When a disaster struck in the north of the country, we immediately answered the call for help.

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:47.389
Seeing our brothers and sisters in need was heartbreaking.

00:06:47.389 --> 00:07:06.029
But what really touched our heart was the spirit of the local brothers and sisters.

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:13.029
They were like the Macedonians. They didn't have much, but they gave generously from the heart.

00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:38.779
When we got home, Madeline and I resolved to show the same kind of spirit.

00:07:38.779 --> 00:07:49.100
First, our appreciation led us to review our contribution to the worldwide work.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:59.120
I've come up with this figure. Is this right?

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.120
Yes.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:10.029
That's just like Jehovah.

00:08:10.029 --> 00:08:24.910
We looked for ways to be generous to those around us.

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:29.910
We discovered that we had the means to give more, so we didn't hold back.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:09:02.750
And then our congregation was invited to help with a special preaching campaign.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:06.750
I think we could do a bit more. Could we push ourselves a bit further?

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:07.750
I'd really like to.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:10.750
It was within our power to help.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:13.750
And that's exactly what we did.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:19.659
I'm bringing too much.

00:09:20.659 --> 00:09:39.700
Did you notice what role faith played in this couple's giving?

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:45.700
For example, they put their faith in Jehovah's promise to care for them in times of need.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:51.700
And so, they set down and reconsider their ability to generously give.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:55.700
Pray, hopefully, they decided on their contribution.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:00.700
In line with our theme, they set something aside.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:08.700
Additionally, they shared materially with their brothers and sisters, food items, and a nice meal.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:18.110
They realized what a blessing it is to be used by Jehovah in caring for others, brothers and sisters.

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:26.110
We live in the most exciting time in history with never to be repeated opportunities to demonstrate our faith.

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:32.110
The Apostle Paul compared this with a large door that opened up.

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:35.110
Please think for a moment.

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:40.110
Has the door to activity opened for you to learn a new language?

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:46.110
Or does it look more like the door leads you to move to where the need is greater?

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:55.110
Did this symposium remind you of the door that is open for you to receive training at the school for Kingdom Evangelizers?

00:10:55.110 --> 00:11:01.110
Or did it direct you to the door for assisting with a theoretical building project?

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:10.110
And maybe this concluding part has reminded all of us of our privilege of generously supporting the Kingdom work by making donations.

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:14.740
Even if they are small.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:20.740
What door is open to you so that you are able to expand your ministry?

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:24.740
Don't feel bad if you hesitate to end up this is normal.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:29.740
And yet please, do not delay entering unnecessarily.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.740
Don't think you can always reach out later.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.740
We all do not know what our life will be like tomorrow.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:43.740
In other words, the door to wonderful blessings that is open today might be close tomorrow.

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:49.740
So be courageous and enter the door to activity in faith.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:56.740
And like many of your brothers and sisters who already made these steps in the past, you will have no regrets.

00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:03.740
Let us all demonstrate our faith by doing all that we can for our friend and God, Jehovah.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:12.740
And we will enjoy a rich life now and will be blessed with an ending life in the future.
