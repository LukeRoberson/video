00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:25.559
Then he said, a certain man had two sons,

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:28.399
and the younger of them said to his father.

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:30.920
Father, give me the part of the property that

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.399
falls to my share.

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.840
Then he divided his means of living to them.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.079
Later, after not many days, the younger son

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.079
gathered all things together and traveled abroad

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.079
into a distant country, their squandered his property

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.640
by living a debauched life.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.399
Then he said to him, child, you have always been with me

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.679
and all the things that our mind are yours.

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:02.159
But we just had to enjoy ourselves and rejoice.

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.280
Because this, your brother was dead and came to life.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:17.530
And he was lost and was found.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.810
I see that, David.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:53.010
I need you to do it.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.290
We live yet.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.090
Who wants to know?

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.129
Come on, little brother.

00:01:57.129 --> 00:01:59.769
Get him move on.

00:01:59.769 --> 00:02:04.250
I need some help moving the extension ladder before we eat.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:46.250
Not today, big brother.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.370
Hey, James, hold on.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.449
That's a two-man job.

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:53.360
OK, let me give you a hand.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.639
You know it's a two-man job.

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.919
You have the mansion and down here by now to help.

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:01.879
Your brother's going for a job interview in the city.

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:03.719
Job interview for what?

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:05.520
Where did this come from?

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.840
You told me and your mother about it last night.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.599
That'll work out really well with the schedule.

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.479
Uh-huh.

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:22.710
OK, yes.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.189
And 50% at the end of the month.

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:31.580
That's right.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.810
And I'll make sure John gets back to you on that.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.490
You're welcome.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.849
Bye-bye.

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.129
Mom, I got to go.

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:41.610
Honey, you're not staying for breakfast?

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:42.569
No, I can't.

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.210
Here, John, the Crawfords accepted your bid.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.729
OK.

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:47.610
Hey, Dad, hey, David, you're not eating with us.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:48.810
No, I got to go.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.210
But breakfast is almost ready.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.729
David, I'd sure like to talk with you before you go.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.370
Yeah, why don't you join us for a while?

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.930
We can talk about things like, you know, the weather.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.889
And how you never told your older brother

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:01.729
that you were looking for another job.

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:02.810
I'm sorry.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.889
I didn't know I needed your permission.

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:06.770
Have you forgotten that you have a job?

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.569
Barker, family, construction?

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.050
You know, the small company that you're 25% of?

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.169
The one that finally has workbook for six months?

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.250
John, can you stir that for me, please?

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.209
OK, first, it's just an interview.

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.610
I haven't actually gotten a job.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.610
And second, maybe I don't want to swing a hammer

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.370
for the rest of my life.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.250
And what's wrong with that?

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.529
Nothing.

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:29.250
I just want to get out of my own, maybe have more responsibility.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.009
David, I told you, you're almost at a point

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:32.810
when I can give you some jobs of your own.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.009
You do good work, and you're only getting better.

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:39.370
So what is this dream job that you're after anyway?

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.449
It's a web marketing company in the city.

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:42.769
Web marketing?

00:04:42.769 --> 00:04:44.649
What experience are you have with that?

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:45.209
None.

00:04:45.209 --> 00:04:48.370
But they're hiring for some big project in Al recommended me.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.850
I'm meeting him first to get some tips before the interview.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.810
Tips from L. I mean, L Phillips.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.610
Please don't tell me you've revived your friendship

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:56.490
with L loser.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.370
He's not a loser.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.129
He's been with the company for two years,

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:01.649
and he's already a project manager.

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:03.129
I'm sorry, I'll rephrase that.

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:04.370
He's a spiritual loser.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.129
You know, James, it's amazing to me that you have time

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:09.370
to be both a carpenter and a judge.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.050
OK, OK, it's time to eat, honey.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.050
Let's do our daily texts and then feed these monkeys.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.490
I think that's a good idea.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.689
Mom, Dad, I'm sorry.

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:22.610
But I'm going to have to do it later.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.810
I'm a little nervous, and I want to get there early.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.689
All right, then, you better get going.

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:29.850
But please, before you agree to anything,

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.370
let's talk about it first, OK?

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.449
Absolutely, Dad.

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:33.889
It's just an interview.

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:34.810
All right.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.810
Well, you need something to eat.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.810
And remember, tonight, I'm making your favorite roast beef.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:40.689
Sounds great.

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:42.129
Thanks, Mom.

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:42.810
Love you.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:43.889
Love you too, honey.

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:45.410
Love you, son.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.009
They remember you have a talk tonight.

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:50.720
Yep, I'm all set.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.079
So what if he actually gets this job?

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:54.160
Are you really going to let him just

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.600
quit in the middle of all this work?

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.120
Well, I guess there's no sense in worrying about what

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.759
hasn't happened yet.

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:02.079
Besides, it's not like I can force him or you

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:04.000
for that matter to work for me.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.199
Dad, I want to work with you.

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:09.519
I appreciate that, son.

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:11.879
Well, let's do our daily texts.

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:13.000
No, don't get me wrong.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.120
I'm definitely so excited about this opportunity.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.120
It's just my family, isn't it?

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.439
Brother is such a control freak, man.

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:20.639
He's just a mellow out.

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:22.360
He's going to have a stroke or something.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.279
Oh, yeah, right.

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:24.920
My main concern is my parents.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.800
I don't think they want me to leave the family business.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.560
And my dad wonders if this is the best move for me.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.480
Classic case of parents not wanting to let go.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.199
But look, years from now, when their old and feeble

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:37.959
and barker family construction is going to under,

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:40.560
they are going to be so grateful that their son

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.519
is a rock solid job with a Fortune 500 company.

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:44.240
He might as well.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.480
I'm right.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.519
Here we are.

00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:47.720
Wow.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.040
Is it the whole building?

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.319
No, it's just two floors.

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:52.319
You think I stand a chance?

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:59.540
Of course.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:00.899
He's with me.

00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:02.779
They don't let you stay here.

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:04.459
All right, let's go over this one more time.

00:07:04.459 --> 00:07:06.019
You got to sell them on your strengths.

00:07:06.019 --> 00:07:07.220
You're a good worker.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.660
Excellent communicator.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:09.420
Quick learner.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.500
Can do, can a guy.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.500
Got it.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.180
You got to sell like a company, man.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:13.980
Yes, sir.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.939
Do whatever it takes or whatever you need.

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:16.699
Stuff like that.

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:17.540
It's very important.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:27.439
Right, right.

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:29.560
So let me be frank.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.399
You don't have any experience in web marketing

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:34.399
or with any marketing for that matter.

00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:41.180
Yes, sir, but I learned very quickly.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.300
This is tough.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.379
I like you.

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:45.819
I like your attitude.

00:07:45.819 --> 00:07:47.740
And I'm impressed with the way you speak.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:48.540
Thank you, sir.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.939
I appreciate that.

00:07:50.939 --> 00:07:52.779
Tell me in your construction job,

00:07:52.779 --> 00:07:55.379
how many hours a day did you work?

00:07:55.379 --> 00:08:01.519
Mostly eight, sometimes less.

00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:06.310
How would you do working a professional week?

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:07.029
Fine.

00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:08.670
How would be no problem?

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:50.360
I'll do whatever it takes, whatever you need.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:09:07.879
David, David, won't you come on back?

00:09:07.879 --> 00:09:09.600
Got something to tell you.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.960
Let me guess.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.960
I don't have enough experience.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.879
That's right.

00:09:13.879 --> 00:09:15.759
You don't.

00:09:15.759 --> 00:09:17.919
But it doesn't matter.

00:09:17.919 --> 00:09:19.159
He really likes you.

00:09:19.159 --> 00:09:20.200
He's going to offer you the job.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:20.720
No way.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.240
Really?

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.320
Oh, and it gets better since you're such a rookie.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.519
He wants you on my team so I get to train you.

00:09:25.519 --> 00:09:26.440
Seriously?

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.519
Yeah, so you don't feel free to refer to me as, sir, from now on.

00:09:30.519 --> 00:09:31.440
Let's go, he's waiting.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.399
Right.

00:09:33.399 --> 00:09:34.360
Actually, wait.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.200
What's wrong?

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.360
You think I can tell Mike that I'll give him an answer tomorrow?

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.879
That would be a very bad idea.

00:09:40.879 --> 00:09:42.840
I know, but my dad wanted me to talk with him

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.919
before I committed to anything.

00:09:43.919 --> 00:09:44.919
What's there to talk about?

00:09:44.919 --> 00:09:47.519
You have 100 other people out there that want this job.

00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:48.639
I know, I want this.

00:09:48.639 --> 00:09:51.279
Then stop letting them mess with your head.

00:09:51.279 --> 00:09:54.759
This guilt, it's not healthy, bro.

00:09:54.759 --> 00:09:57.360
You're just going to do it yourself to a life of working

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.379
on other people's gutters and roofs.

00:10:01.379 --> 00:10:02.220
You're probably right.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:03.100
I know I'm right.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.299
It's a gift of mine.

00:10:04.299 --> 00:10:09.600
What are you super-getting at before he changes his mind?

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.879
All right, let's do it.

00:10:10.879 --> 00:10:14.440
Now you're talking.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.039
So what I can offer you as a position

00:10:16.039 --> 00:10:18.240
as a project assistant.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.519
Once you sign the company confidentiality agreement,

00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:22.120
you'll get more details.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:26.000
For now, this will tell you about our company.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.559
Thank you for the opportunity, Mr. Benson.

00:10:28.559 --> 00:10:31.000
I really, really appreciate it.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.240
I won't disappoint you.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:32.960
Beautiful.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.639
Any questions?

00:10:34.639 --> 00:10:35.759
Just one.

00:10:35.759 --> 00:10:37.279
Every week, I have meetings.

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:39.159
Excuse me.

00:10:39.159 --> 00:10:39.919
Yes?

00:10:39.919 --> 00:10:41.360
Gene Weber is online, too.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.200
Thank you.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.639
Listen, I got to take this.

00:10:44.639 --> 00:10:46.840
Did you want to tell me something?

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.759
No, nothing.

00:10:47.759 --> 00:10:49.039
It can wait.

00:10:49.039 --> 00:10:50.200
Very good.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.080
Al, why don't you take David, show him around,

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.480
and then take him down to HR to make it official.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.799
David Barker, welcome to True North.

00:10:57.799 --> 00:11:02.740
Thank you, Mr. Benson.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:07.620
My friend, let me introduce you to a new home away from home.

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:09.019
I give you the lay of the lands.

00:11:09.019 --> 00:11:11.500
We get the manager's offices over there.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.139
That includes me.

00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:15.179
This is what we call the pod village.

00:11:15.179 --> 00:11:16.980
It's where the worker bees reside.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.259
They take care of the search engine management,

00:11:19.259 --> 00:11:23.179
analytics, graphics, sales, things like that.

00:11:23.179 --> 00:11:24.179
It will.

00:11:24.179 --> 00:11:25.500
My computer to run slowly.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.700
I need you to stop by this morning.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.700
Check it out for me.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.379
First off, Al, you're not my boss.

00:11:31.379 --> 00:11:34.100
Second, I'll get to it when I can.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:37.500
And third, maybe your computer wouldn't be running so slow

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.740
if you'd stop downloading things you shouldn't be, OK?

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:44.340
OK, we'll get to it when you can.

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:45.179
You said tea, guys.

00:11:45.179 --> 00:11:47.779
They forget who they're working for.

00:11:47.779 --> 00:11:50.620
And this is our break room here.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:53.779
Over here, this belongs to a good friend of mine.

00:11:53.779 --> 00:11:56.100
And who would that be?

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.539
Come on, man, take a seat.

00:11:57.539 --> 00:11:59.179
I've really got hired.

00:11:59.179 --> 00:12:00.899
I mean, this is all mine.

00:12:00.899 --> 00:12:01.659
You did?

00:12:01.659 --> 00:12:02.980
And yes, it is.

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.740
The only problem is I have no idea what I'm doing.

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:06.299
Oh, don't worry.

00:12:06.299 --> 00:12:07.820
I'll cover for you.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:08.899
Just one question.

00:12:08.899 --> 00:12:10.940
What is a professional week?

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.980
That's a nice way of saying we work overtime.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.419
Don't get paid for it.

00:12:14.419 --> 00:12:15.460
Does that happen a lot?

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.059
And it depends on what the deadline is.

00:12:17.059 --> 00:12:19.299
Come on, there's a couple of people I want you to meet.

00:12:19.299 --> 00:12:23.480
Well, that's a completely unrealistic date.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:30.250
Why don't they ask the people that actually do the work?

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:34.220
I know, of course.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.460
Thank you.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.299
Vivian Love, do you have a moment

00:12:38.299 --> 00:12:39.980
to the someone I would like to introduce you to?

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:40.779
Sure.

00:12:40.779 --> 00:12:42.980
Dave, this is Vivian Chen, our project coordinator.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:44.419
And Dave, this.

00:12:44.419 --> 00:12:47.659
Let me guess, David Barker, old friend of ours,

00:12:47.659 --> 00:12:49.179
our new project assistant.

00:12:49.179 --> 00:12:50.299
You start next week.

00:12:50.299 --> 00:12:51.700
Great to finally meet you.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.740
Oh, and these are on your travels fast.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:57.299
Well, Al here has been singing your praises for two weeks.

00:12:57.299 --> 00:12:59.740
I have expected you to have a halo.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.100
Well, it's very nice to meet you, Vivian.

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:02.980
I admit the part about walking on water

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.740
was a bit of an exaggeration.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.460
Hey, Viv, oh, I'm sorry to interrupt.

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:07.860
Hear the sketches?

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:08.860
Hey, Al.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.419
David, back from your long weekend at the shore, I see.

00:13:11.419 --> 00:13:11.940
Yes.

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.100
How things work out?

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:14.299
Don't ask.

00:13:14.299 --> 00:13:16.779
Are all men shallow or only the ones that I've dated?

00:13:16.779 --> 00:13:18.580
I don't know, I've never dated one.

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.220
Taylor, I like to meet David Barker,

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:21.539
our new project assistant.

00:13:21.539 --> 00:13:23.940
And one of the most unshallowed men I know.

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.340
Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you, David.

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:26.500
Nice to meet you, two-tailor.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.019
I was washing earlier.

00:13:28.019 --> 00:13:29.899
I mean, I saw you earlier in the lobby.

00:13:29.899 --> 00:13:31.340
I was waiting for you to interview.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:31.860
Of course.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.059
I guess you forgot to mention that he's also a stalker.

00:13:34.059 --> 00:13:35.620
An unshallowed stalker?

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.059
I can't say I've ever met one.

00:13:37.059 --> 00:13:39.179
Well, you two will make a great team.

00:13:39.179 --> 00:13:42.100
Stalker and professional flirt.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.419
Taylor is in creative.

00:13:43.419 --> 00:13:45.899
Seriously, though, congratulations on getting the job.

00:13:45.899 --> 00:13:53.039
I'm looking forward to working with you.

00:13:53.039 --> 00:13:54.600
I thought you said we were going to talk

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.120
before you agreed to anything.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.879
Now you're telling me you're going to start next week?

00:13:59.879 --> 00:14:04.080
Dad, I didn't expect to be offered the job on this spot.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.600
I didn't expect to be offered the job at all.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.279
But couldn't you wait just another day or two?

00:14:09.279 --> 00:14:11.120
Well, I mentioned that to Al, but he thought

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.600
I needed to jump on this right away.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.679
Now it makes sense.

00:14:13.679 --> 00:14:14.639
Al Phillips.

00:14:14.639 --> 00:14:15.480
Of course.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.960
It does make sense.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:21.480
I was offered a job for which I have no experience.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.799
And they were interviewing people with lots of it.

00:14:23.799 --> 00:14:25.480
Why would I wait?

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.720
How about this?

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.960
Dad asked you to.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.519
You know, the man who put a roof over his head.

00:14:29.519 --> 00:14:32.960
James, please.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.600
You know we would really love you to stay

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.600
on with the family business.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.360
And I don't want to lose you.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.000
Now, if you want to do something else to make a living,

00:14:42.039 --> 00:14:44.519
I can accept that.

00:14:44.519 --> 00:14:47.480
But have you really counted the cost?

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.879
What impact will this have on your spiritual routine?

00:14:50.879 --> 00:14:53.240
I don't think any at all, Dad.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.039
OK, well, have you considered the extra time each week

00:14:56.039 --> 00:14:57.879
to commute?

00:14:57.879 --> 00:15:00.080
Rush hour, two, and from the city each day

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.799
can be pretty brutal.

00:15:01.799 --> 00:15:05.360
But there are other brothers who do that.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.799
What about the hours they expect you to work?

00:15:07.799 --> 00:15:12.399
Will it interfere with your meetings, your auxiliary pioneering?

00:15:12.399 --> 00:15:13.919
Well, I may have to put that on hold.

00:15:13.919 --> 00:15:16.120
But it's an interview with my meetings.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.840
What do you mean it shouldn't?

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.559
You did talk about our meetings, didn't you?

00:15:19.559 --> 00:15:23.600
Do you mind having a conversation with mom and dad?

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.200
Dad.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.559
It'll have very little impact on my spiritual routine.

00:15:28.559 --> 00:15:31.480
OK, fair enough.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.159
But what about your goal to regular pioneer?

00:15:34.159 --> 00:15:38.080
We set up savings accounts to help you boys do that.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.000
I appreciate that you're concerned about me.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.840
I do, but I'm 21 years old.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:47.000
I've just seen how some jobs can consume a brother,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.399
where there's very little time or energy left for Jehovah.

00:15:51.399 --> 00:15:53.399
I just want to make sure you're thinking

00:15:53.399 --> 00:15:56.639
this whole thing through, David.

00:15:56.639 --> 00:15:59.559
Remember, honey, what your dad always says?

00:15:59.559 --> 00:16:01.960
Measure twice, cut once.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:02.240
Cut once.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.000
I know, mom.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.519
I know.

00:16:05.519 --> 00:16:07.679
I am thinking this through.

00:16:07.679 --> 00:16:10.679
And I'm really, really excited about this job.

00:16:10.679 --> 00:16:17.090
Please, everyone stop worrying about me.

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:19.929
It's not like I'm falling out of the truth.

00:16:19.929 --> 00:16:23.289
Of course you're not.

00:16:23.289 --> 00:16:25.490
Wouldn't you like something else to eat?

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:27.690
Actually, I'm going to go over my talk one more time

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:28.929
before me.

00:16:28.929 --> 00:16:37.679
All right, then.

00:16:37.679 --> 00:16:39.519
So now what are we going to do?

00:16:39.519 --> 00:16:41.879
We'll make the best out of it.

00:16:41.879 --> 00:16:46.480
I'm sure we can find a brother that's looking for some work.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.720
Ed Brewster's a really good carpenter.

00:16:48.759 --> 00:16:49.360
That's right.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.559
I'll give him a call.

00:16:51.559 --> 00:16:56.039
I'm very uncomfortable about David taking on this job.

00:16:56.039 --> 00:16:59.519
Sooner or later, everyone has to make their own decisions.

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:08.190
I think the best thing right now is to show David some support.

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:18.769
I feel like I've been supporting him for years.

00:17:18.769 --> 00:17:21.970
I am really worried about those boys.

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:24.650
They are two very different personalities.

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:26.250
That's for sure.

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.410
But they're both hard workers.

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:30.450
They have good hearts.

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:33.529
And I know they loved you a whole lot.

00:17:33.529 --> 00:17:35.849
They'll work it out.

00:17:35.849 --> 00:17:38.529
Let's give them some time.

00:17:38.529 --> 00:17:40.529
Why don't we say a prayer about it?

00:17:40.529 --> 00:17:53.650
We're already in the quinoa, OK?

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:55.410
Saturday would be perfect.

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:57.849
In fact, I have a couple of return visits we could do.

00:17:57.849 --> 00:18:00.089
Great comment on the Bible highlights tonight.

00:18:00.089 --> 00:18:01.089
Thanks, Brother Barker.

00:18:01.089 --> 00:18:02.170
Hey, how's school going for it?

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:03.569
Well, that sounds really cool.

00:18:03.569 --> 00:18:04.650
And you start next week?

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:06.049
Yeah, I'm really excited.

00:18:06.049 --> 00:18:07.569
This company is huge.

00:18:07.569 --> 00:18:09.049
And it's getting even bigger.

00:18:09.049 --> 00:18:12.490
And the fact that I get hired, it's pretty amazing.

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:15.650
David, I wanted to tell you I really enjoyed your talk.

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:16.730
Very nice job.

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:17.809
Thanks, Brother Barker.

00:18:17.809 --> 00:18:18.410
I don't think so.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.210
I have my foot in the door, with all sorts

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:21.970
of potential for advancement.

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:23.529
Aren't you going to miss the family business?

00:18:23.529 --> 00:18:24.289
Let me think.

00:18:24.289 --> 00:18:25.410
No more splinters.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.210
No more bruise thumbs.

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:29.970
No more older brother, micro-managing by work.

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:31.730
Let me get back to you on that.

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:41.279
But the people I'll be working with are super cool.

00:18:41.279 --> 00:18:44.400
So I wonder if your friend Al was at his meeting tonight.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.759
My guess would be not.

00:18:47.759 --> 00:18:48.599
What?

00:18:48.599 --> 00:18:50.279
Where did that come from?

00:18:50.279 --> 00:18:53.519
Look, I know you're excited about your new job.

00:18:53.519 --> 00:18:55.119
Just can't wait to get away from us

00:18:55.119 --> 00:18:58.119
micro-managing blue counterworkers.

00:18:58.119 --> 00:18:59.160
Yeah, that's right.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.599
I heard what you said.

00:19:00.599 --> 00:19:03.880
If you're not happy working for our company, so be it.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.920
I just wish that was what someone else.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.799
Listen.

00:19:07.799 --> 00:19:10.400
Al may not live up to your perfect standards,

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.640
but he's a baptized brother and a good friend

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.039
who stuck his neck out for me.

00:19:15.559 --> 00:19:17.119
He got to stop all this worrying.

00:19:17.119 --> 00:19:18.400
It isn't healthy.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.200
Give yourself a stroke or something.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:27.569
Now, if you don't mind, I have to learn about my new company.

00:19:27.569 --> 00:19:29.009
Please.

00:19:29.009 --> 00:19:31.849
Just watch yourself, OK?

00:19:31.849 --> 00:19:32.650
OK.

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:34.250
Thanks for the advice.

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:41.740
Went shutting the door on your way out.

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:45.940
OK, so moving on, I'm sure you've heard.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:48.700
But in case you were in a coma and just woke up,

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.099
our sales team hit a big home run last week

00:19:51.099 --> 00:19:52.259
with Global Prop.

00:19:52.259 --> 00:19:54.779
And we won the contract for their next online marketing

00:19:54.779 --> 00:20:01.880
campaign.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.720
Big time praise goes out to the teams

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.279
that worked on deck on this one.

00:20:05.279 --> 00:20:08.720
Sales says the presentation was triple A standard.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.759
Fantastic work, guys.

00:20:11.759 --> 00:20:16.799
Of course, now comes a really fun part.

00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:20.799
Our client wants to have creative comps, two weeks.

00:20:20.799 --> 00:20:26.720
And to launch four months.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:33.359
I know, I know people, I'm not happy about this either.

00:20:33.359 --> 00:20:35.559
This is big.

00:20:35.559 --> 00:20:38.079
Corporate is investing heavily in this project,

00:20:38.079 --> 00:20:40.680
and we need to shine on this one.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:44.279
That means this takes priority.

00:20:44.279 --> 00:20:48.000
Look, you're all top performers.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.880
You can do this.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.160
So what do you say?

00:20:51.519 --> 00:20:54.319
Let's make it happen.

00:20:54.319 --> 00:21:36.440
Can I play some ball?

00:21:36.440 --> 00:22:13.640
Come on, let's go.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:14.279
Wake up.

00:22:14.279 --> 00:23:43.319
Take this.

00:23:43.319 --> 00:23:46.279
James, you're up late.

00:23:46.279 --> 00:23:48.680
Yeah, we need this thing for tomorrow.

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.640
Oh, God, it's still jamming up, huh?

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.039
Just the third time this one.

00:23:52.039 --> 00:23:53.559
I know it well.

00:23:53.559 --> 00:23:55.920
I must have repaired that thing 100 times.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.880
Why doesn't dad just get a new one?

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:00.599
I think, yes, some sort of sentimental attachment to it.

00:24:00.599 --> 00:24:02.079
It's probably the first one he ever owned.

00:24:02.079 --> 00:24:04.200
Probably.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.319
How about you?

00:24:05.319 --> 00:24:06.839
Devi working late again?

00:24:06.839 --> 00:24:08.839
Yeah, yeah.

00:24:08.839 --> 00:24:11.960
This project we're working on, it's for a huge client.

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.960
We're burning the candle at both ends,

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.799
trying to meet some unrealistic deadline

00:24:15.799 --> 00:24:18.640
to make account services happy.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.359
Sounds intense.

00:24:21.359 --> 00:24:24.759
So this is job everything you thought would be?

00:24:24.759 --> 00:24:27.240
To be honest, I didn't know what it would be.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:29.720
I like the corporate vibe and the challenge

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.160
of doing something different.

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:34.119
It's awesome collaborating on a project.

00:24:34.119 --> 00:24:35.599
Maybe someday I'll get sick of it?

00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:36.960
I don't know, like anything else.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.279
But for now, I like it.

00:24:39.279 --> 00:24:40.960
It's kind of exciting.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.559
Well, you'll do well, then.

00:24:43.559 --> 00:24:45.400
I'm sure you're one of the best workers that they have.

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.319
Thanks.

00:24:46.319 --> 00:24:48.240
Say, if you ever need a recommendation.

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.519
No, thanks.

00:24:49.519 --> 00:24:50.920
There's one shark infested ocean.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:56.390
I have no desire to swim in.

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:58.670
Well, I better get to bed.

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:01.470
Rushed hour is only a few hours away.

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:05.369
I'll see you in the morning.

00:25:05.369 --> 00:25:09.130
Hey, David, can I ask you something?

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:16.230
Yeah.

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:19.250
What's going on, man?

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:21.569
You mean other than what we just talked about?

00:25:21.569 --> 00:25:24.049
All this overtime for some corporate monster

00:25:24.049 --> 00:25:28.930
that could care less about you, the association, it's not good.

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:30.130
It's starting to affect you.

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:33.170
You know, for a minute, I actually

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:36.289
thought that you were interested in what I'm doing.

00:25:36.289 --> 00:25:39.170
I am interested in what you're doing.

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:40.009
And that's why I'm worried.

00:25:40.009 --> 00:25:41.170
Well, stop.

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:42.650
You've got nothing to worry about.

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:44.170
I'm doing fine.

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:45.809
You're doing fine.

00:25:45.809 --> 00:25:47.609
In less than two months, you've missed six meetings

00:25:47.609 --> 00:25:49.049
and three weekends of field service.

00:25:49.049 --> 00:25:51.250
Are you keeping track?

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:53.089
Anything else, Detective Barker?

00:25:53.089 --> 00:25:54.730
Actually, yeah.

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:56.210
Your watchtower is never studied.

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:58.009
You'll hardly answer at the meetings.

00:25:58.009 --> 00:26:00.130
All you ever talk about is work.

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:01.009
That's not fine.

00:26:01.009 --> 00:26:01.849
You know it.

00:26:01.849 --> 00:26:04.410
It's like you're becoming a carbon copy of L Phillips.

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:06.329
You really need to get some new material.

00:26:06.329 --> 00:26:08.329
I warned you about him.

00:26:08.329 --> 00:26:09.410
And it's all coming true.

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:11.690
Well, then I guess you're not a prophet to your many roles, then.

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:13.690
How about brother who cares?

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:15.930
Who's something that's neck out for you's entire life?

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:17.410
Who doesn't want to see his brother get hurt?

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:18.410
Oh, save your two.

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:20.009
Don't go and mock me.

00:26:20.009 --> 00:26:23.650
It's just my body that she anything redeeming in that guy.

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:25.890
You're just jealous, aren't you?

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:27.569
Jellice of L. Are you crazy?

00:26:27.569 --> 00:26:30.170
No, jealous right to the bone, because Al, unlike you,

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:31.849
he enjoys life.

00:26:31.849 --> 00:26:33.250
He makes friends with everyone.

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:34.049
He's happy.

00:26:34.049 --> 00:26:35.329
He's successful.

00:26:35.329 --> 00:26:37.410
People in the congregation liked him.

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:39.690
That is until people like you started bad mouthing.

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:40.529
People like me.

00:26:40.529 --> 00:26:42.130
Boring up tight, self-righteous.

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:43.009
I could go on.

00:26:43.009 --> 00:26:45.569
Why I'm struggling to stand the cramp road of life.

00:26:45.569 --> 00:26:48.289
You're off running around on the widened spacious

00:26:48.289 --> 00:26:50.329
with dreams of being some corporate big shot.

00:26:50.329 --> 00:26:51.569
You're just jealous of that, too.

00:26:51.569 --> 00:26:54.089
Not on your life.

00:26:54.089 --> 00:26:56.490
I want to do what's right in God's eyes.

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:57.809
I wanted the same thing for you to do.

00:26:57.809 --> 00:26:59.690
You only think about your self-smuglet.

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:10.700
Go ahead, say it.

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:15.559
Do what you want, David.

00:27:15.559 --> 00:27:17.880
I can't stop you.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.279
Mom and dad can't stop you.

00:27:21.279 --> 00:27:24.240
Jehovah's not going to stop you.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.319
This is your decision.

00:27:25.319 --> 00:27:27.079
Now you're finally getting it.

00:27:27.079 --> 00:27:29.279
I don't know if you get it.

00:27:29.279 --> 00:27:31.799
As you sink deeper into this world's mess,

00:27:31.799 --> 00:27:34.920
who do you think is going to reach in and pull you out?

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.160
I'm not.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:52.230
As of now, I'm done.

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:53.630
You know, just sick as me to think how much you're

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:59.400
going to hurt mom and dad.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:08.160
I'm going to bed.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:13.930
I was a good brother to you.

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:56.400
Some good brother.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.640
So is work always like this?

00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.440
I'm pretty much.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.799
Sales ends big new account.

00:29:00.799 --> 00:29:03.799
Promises the client of the world.

00:29:03.799 --> 00:29:04.640
Thank you.

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:05.640
Thanks.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.880
Then Mike pumps us up with the motivational speech

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.480
about how this would be the game changer for our branch.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.160
Then we run around like crazy to get done.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.200
On time and under budget, of course.

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.480
You learn quickly.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:25.519
And if not, Mike gives us another speech.

00:29:25.519 --> 00:29:27.880
He seems like a nice enough guy, though.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.119
Oh, he can be.

00:29:29.119 --> 00:29:31.440
The Zones corporate headquarters is happy.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.160
Mike is a company man first.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.279
Nice guy second.

00:29:34.279 --> 00:29:39.720
You see?

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.880
Everything OK?

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.039
Yeah, it's fine.

00:29:42.039 --> 00:29:44.759
Just a persistent ex-boyfriend, sorry.

00:29:44.759 --> 00:29:45.480
Let me guess.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.440
The guy you were talking about when we first met?

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.160
I have a good memory.

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:52.000
Yes, another tragic love story.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Girl gives her heart to guy, and guy cheats on her.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.480
They break up, and guy tries to win her back.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.160
Taylor, I haven't known you that long,

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:04.000
but I'm pretty sure you deserve a whole lot better than that.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.200
Thank you.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.400
I think so too.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.799
Well, now that you know all about me,

00:30:08.799 --> 00:30:10.680
I don't know very much about you.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.279
Other than you grew up with Al,

00:30:12.279 --> 00:30:13.880
you worked as a carpenter.

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:16.480
You're a super nice guy, and you don't curse.

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.240
Tell me more.

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.240
That's about it.

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:21.440
You've pretty much covered everything.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.480
Come on.

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.960
Really, there's not much else.

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:29.759
I started working for my dad's company when I was 16.

00:30:29.759 --> 00:30:31.880
Barker family construction.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:34.000
A forward-moving, privately-owned firm

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.519
based out of a modest facility, our garage,

00:30:37.519 --> 00:30:40.640
that features a highly sympathica workforce.

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.480
My dad, mom, and older brother.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.440
Our mission statement?

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:48.599
No job, too small.

00:30:48.599 --> 00:30:50.559
Sounds like a nice, cute work for it.

00:30:50.559 --> 00:30:52.880
Yeah, I guess it was.

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.559
I just kind of grew out of it, you know?

00:30:54.559 --> 00:30:56.960
And it's my recent job change.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.400
Now with your construction background,

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.960
how do you explain the nice guy no cursing part?

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.599
That.

00:31:03.599 --> 00:31:05.880
Well, my family is very religious,

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.279
so we were raised studying the Bible.

00:31:08.279 --> 00:31:10.799
OK, what religion?

00:31:10.799 --> 00:31:12.079
Christian.

00:31:12.079 --> 00:31:16.779
Well, I figured that, but what church?

00:31:16.779 --> 00:31:18.380
Where Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:19.859
Oh, really?

00:31:19.859 --> 00:31:21.420
You know, there was a girl in high school

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:23.579
that was Jehovah Witness.

00:31:23.579 --> 00:31:25.180
She was really, really into it.

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:27.900
Actually, some of the kids kind of made fun of her.

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:33.019
I tell you the truth, I don't know much about it.

00:31:33.019 --> 00:31:35.180
It looks like Al is going to send out a search party

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:37.019
if we don't get back.

00:31:37.019 --> 00:31:38.259
I wouldn't want that now, would we?

00:31:38.259 --> 00:31:54.450
No.

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:57.650
Research for our project?

00:31:57.650 --> 00:31:59.250
How is your coffee break?

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:00.529
Ah, good.

00:32:00.529 --> 00:32:02.170
Why do you ask?

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:04.609
So you are interested in it?

00:32:04.609 --> 00:32:06.529
We had coffee, that's all.

00:32:06.529 --> 00:32:08.809
Oh, sure, it starts with coffee.

00:32:08.809 --> 00:32:11.329
Now, if you don't mind, I have work to do.

00:32:11.329 --> 00:32:14.890
Actually, Romeo, I have some life-altering news for you.

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:23.369
How about we head to the Think Tank?

00:32:23.369 --> 00:32:27.250
So, what is this life-altering news that you have for me?

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:29.769
You remember my cousin Anta, right?

00:32:29.769 --> 00:32:31.369
Yeah, the one that lives downtown.

00:32:31.369 --> 00:32:33.849
Yeah, well, he's got to tell me that two of his roommates

00:32:33.849 --> 00:32:36.009
just moved out of the apartment.

00:32:36.009 --> 00:32:39.130
So, he's got to rent the rooms at an order

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:40.490
for to stay there.

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:41.450
Go on.

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:42.650
Stuff to spell this out for you.

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:45.329
Two rooms, two people, two miles from work.

00:32:45.329 --> 00:32:46.529
It's too good to pass up.

00:32:46.529 --> 00:32:48.250
God, it's too expensive.

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:49.490
This is a no-brainer.

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:52.210
You really think that we should sublet for a man-time.

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:53.890
Think about it, no more long commute,

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:55.569
no more getting stuck in traffic,

00:32:55.569 --> 00:32:57.369
no more having your loving family,

00:32:57.369 --> 00:32:59.490
scrutinize every movie you make.

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:01.809
Yeah, the cherry on top is that we get to room together.

00:33:01.809 --> 00:33:05.529
Maybe forgetting that I make way less money than you.

00:33:05.529 --> 00:33:07.369
Dave, it's only a matter of time for you to get a raise.

00:33:07.369 --> 00:33:08.569
Probably a promotion.

00:33:08.569 --> 00:33:11.329
Well, until then, I can't afford it.

00:33:11.329 --> 00:33:16.589
Don't you have any savings you can tap into?

00:33:16.589 --> 00:33:19.190
Yeah, some.

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:20.670
All right, let me talk to my parents first,

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:24.200
and I'll get back to you.

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:32.509
Listen, here, take a seat.

00:33:32.509 --> 00:33:33.950
I'll be up front with you.

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:36.549
As a favor to me, Anta was willing to let you rent out

00:33:36.549 --> 00:33:39.549
the room instead of his girlfriend's brother.

00:33:39.549 --> 00:33:40.710
But you got to act now,

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:47.240
or the deal's going to be gone by this weekend.

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:50.160
Blake, you're 21 years old.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:55.279
You can't live with your parents forever.

00:33:55.279 --> 00:33:58.279
Don't you think it's time you leave the nest?

00:33:58.279 --> 00:34:00.960
Spread your wings?

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:10.699
Be your own man.

00:34:10.699 --> 00:34:11.219
You're right.

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:12.260
All right, I'll take it.

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:12.780
I'm in.

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:13.619
Fantastic.

00:34:13.619 --> 00:34:21.440
Let me just call Anta.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.440
Hey, Anta.

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:25.480
Yeah, yeah, my boy, David's in.

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.039
Tonight?

00:34:27.039 --> 00:34:28.360
Sure, Pete's.

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.480
Yeah.

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:31.639
All right.

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:32.519
OK, we'll see you there.

00:34:32.519 --> 00:34:33.320
Bye.

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.000
It's done.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:34.719
We'll meet him tonight.

00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:36.119
We'll see you the deal over a couple of years.

00:34:36.119 --> 00:34:36.800
No, we won't.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:37.960
I have a talk tonight.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.960
In fact, I have to finish writing it.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.280
Can't you get somebody to replace you?

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.159
I hate to do that again.

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:44.280
Just do what I do.

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.199
Don't show up.

00:34:45.199 --> 00:34:46.000
Somebody always covers you.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.480
I'm not doing that.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:59.699
Come on, man, it's just this once.

00:34:59.699 --> 00:35:02.420
Hey, brother Harper, it's David.

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:03.219
I'm Kid, thanks.

00:35:03.219 --> 00:35:05.059
How are you?

00:35:05.059 --> 00:35:05.980
Kid.

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.219
Hey, something came up at work,

00:35:08.219 --> 00:35:10.539
and I'm not going to be able to give my talk tonight.

00:35:10.539 --> 00:35:11.340
I'm so sorry.

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:14.820
I really hope you can find someone to cover for me.

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:17.880
I know.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:18.199
I know.

00:35:18.199 --> 00:35:20.199
I'm sorry.

00:35:20.199 --> 00:35:21.800
OK, thank you.

00:35:21.800 --> 00:36:01.530
All right, bye.

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:03.650
Hello, son.

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:06.159
Yeah.

00:36:06.159 --> 00:36:07.119
He scared me.

00:36:07.119 --> 00:36:12.110
What are you still doing up?

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:14.710
I didn't know you had to work so late.

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:18.030
Last night, I heard you were giving a talk tonight.

00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:19.829
I'm sorry.

00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:20.949
I should have told you.

00:36:20.949 --> 00:36:23.909
Some work-related stuff came up,

00:36:23.909 --> 00:36:27.639
and one thing led to another.

00:36:27.639 --> 00:36:31.639
Son, we need to talk.

00:36:31.639 --> 00:36:43.920
Please, would you sit down for a minute?

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:47.760
You know, your mother and I are very worried about you.

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.800
You've been missing your meetings, your service,

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:53.760
your family worship with us.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.840
It has been happening more and more.

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:56.960
I know, dad.

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.920
It'll be a little insane just till we meet this deadline.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.960
And then what?

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:04.760
What about the deadline after that?

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:07.199
I used to work for a big company.

00:37:07.199 --> 00:37:11.000
The more you keep giving, the more they'll keep taking.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.480
Where are you going to draw the line?

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:16.960
What I worked for you, we had deadlines, things that went wrong.

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.039
We worked over time.

00:37:18.039 --> 00:37:19.639
Sometimes?

00:37:19.639 --> 00:37:23.320
But very rarely did it interfere with our theocratic schedule.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:27.840
I've been pretty successful at keeping the business in its place.

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:28.840
You have, dad.

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:29.760
I know.

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:33.019
You said a good example that way.

00:37:33.019 --> 00:37:37.019
Why don't you consider coming back to the family business with us?

00:37:37.019 --> 00:37:42.380
You can get stabilized, and I can give you a small raise.

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:43.260
I can't.

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:44.300
No.

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:46.460
Dad, I'm sorry.

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:51.219
Construction, it's great for you and James, but not for me.

00:37:51.219 --> 00:37:54.139
I'm really happy where I met.

00:37:54.139 --> 00:38:02.469
And the people they respect me, I like this job.

00:38:02.469 --> 00:38:05.590
Is a job worth sacrificing your relationship with Jehovah?

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:07.150
Of course not.

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:09.230
It's not like that's happening.

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:12.349
The Bibles filled with examples of people who felt the same way

00:38:12.349 --> 00:38:18.949
in the beginning, but then something happened gradually.

00:38:18.949 --> 00:38:24.159
I'm not quite sure how that applies to me.

00:38:24.159 --> 00:38:27.159
Here, let me show you something, David.

00:38:27.159 --> 00:38:29.039
Maybe this will help.

00:38:29.039 --> 00:38:37.480
Read Hebrews 2.1.

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:40.320
That is why it is necessary for us to pay more

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:43.559
than the usual attention to the things heard by us

00:38:43.559 --> 00:38:46.639
that we may never drift away.

00:38:46.639 --> 00:38:48.320
OK?

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:52.239
We need to pay attention because any one of us could drift,

00:38:52.239 --> 00:38:56.469
and it could lead to our spiritual shipwreck.

00:38:56.469 --> 00:39:02.190
Sometimes it takes other people to point out that we're drifting.

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:04.230
Well, I've got lots of people pointing.

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:15.849
You, mom, James, the elders, the list is pretty long.

00:39:15.849 --> 00:39:18.210
Listen, Dad.

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:25.829
I appreciate your concern.

00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:27.710
I need to tell you something.

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:31.139
What is it?

00:39:31.139 --> 00:39:34.949
I'm going to move out.

00:39:34.949 --> 00:39:38.159
What?

00:39:38.159 --> 00:39:39.280
To where?

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.480
Alice Cousin Anton.

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.599
He's got an apartment in the city.

00:39:42.599 --> 00:39:44.840
What's wrong with living here?

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.280
I need more freedom.

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:47.800
Some independence?

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:50.079
Freedom and independence from what?

00:39:50.079 --> 00:39:51.159
Come on, Dad.

00:39:51.159 --> 00:39:53.039
Where do I start?

00:39:53.039 --> 00:39:56.039
I feel like I'm constantly being questioned.

00:39:56.039 --> 00:39:57.440
Where are you going?

00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:59.239
Who are you with?

00:39:59.239 --> 00:40:01.360
What's the name of the movie you're seeing?

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:04.119
Oh, he's not good association.

00:40:04.119 --> 00:40:08.400
You need to use the internet in the living room.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.599
Even when you don't see anything I can tell.

00:40:11.599 --> 00:40:14.039
I feel so restricted.

00:40:14.039 --> 00:40:16.960
David, we live by Bible principles in our house.

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:18.199
They're not restrictive.

00:40:18.199 --> 00:40:19.679
They protect us.

00:40:19.679 --> 00:40:23.360
My point is I need to answer for myself.

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.800
All of us have an accounting to God, right?

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:26.559
That's true.

00:40:26.559 --> 00:40:30.280
I just want to make my own decisions then, right or wrong.

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:31.760
Is that such a bad thing?

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:34.280
If you know what's right and you choose to do what's wrong,

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.119
then it is a bad thing.

00:40:36.119 --> 00:40:40.289
Honey, what's going on?

00:40:40.289 --> 00:40:42.849
What's wrong?

00:40:42.849 --> 00:40:46.500
David and I are just talking.

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:49.659
He wants to move into the city and to an apartment

00:40:49.659 --> 00:40:52.860
with Al and his cousin Anton.

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:55.179
What?

00:40:55.179 --> 00:40:57.940
Why would you want to do that?

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:01.380
I don't want to get into all the details right now.

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:03.860
Let's just say it'll be a lot closer to work

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:05.780
and we'll leave it at that.

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:07.900
I don't understand.

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.420
You have everything you need here.

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:12.820
You save money and you're surrounded

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:14.300
by people that love you.

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:15.619
That's the problem.

00:41:15.619 --> 00:41:17.340
I'm feeling love to death.

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:19.420
There's no such thing.

00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:21.179
Oh, there is.

00:41:21.179 --> 00:41:24.780
And this family is a prime example.

00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:27.780
Well, what congregation would you go to?

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:30.099
I don't know yet, Mom.

00:41:30.099 --> 00:41:32.420
Your dad knows brothers in the city.

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:34.460
He could call someone and find out.

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:37.340
No, that's all right.

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:40.260
I'll take care of it when I'm ready.

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:44.699
When you're ready, David, that's one of the first things

00:41:44.699 --> 00:41:45.780
you should find out.

00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:48.179
Mom, please.

00:41:48.179 --> 00:41:53.369
Can you even afford a place in the city?

00:41:53.369 --> 00:41:59.909
Since you asked, I'm going to need to tap into the savings

00:41:59.909 --> 00:42:02.349
account you set up for me.

00:42:02.349 --> 00:42:03.869
I was supposed to help you pioneer.

00:42:03.869 --> 00:42:05.829
It's my money, isn't it?

00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:08.110
Are you going to question how I use that also?

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:09.030
David!

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:13.530
No, that's all right.

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:15.369
It's your money.

00:42:15.369 --> 00:42:17.329
Thank you.

00:42:17.329 --> 00:42:18.929
Well, well, well.

00:42:18.929 --> 00:42:21.650
What new pain are you causing the family now, little brother?

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:23.250
Stay out of this, James.

00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:24.690
Oh, I know that's OK.

00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:26.250
I already heard most of it.

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:30.130
So you want to move in with Elle's cousin, Anton.

00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:31.369
I wonder which one of his girlfriends is

00:42:31.369 --> 00:42:33.170
spending the night these days?

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:35.929
You mean Anton is not in the truth?

00:42:35.929 --> 00:42:37.409
Is that true?

00:42:37.409 --> 00:42:38.690
You didn't mention that.

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:41.369
Oh, I'm sure there's a lot more is not telling you.

00:42:41.369 --> 00:42:43.489
Now you and your mentor can really find out

00:42:43.489 --> 00:42:45.289
what this world has to offer.

00:42:45.289 --> 00:42:47.889
David, why are you putting yourself in that situation?

00:42:47.889 --> 00:42:49.010
You're just asking for trouble.

00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:50.050
It's no big deal.

00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:51.050
I can handle it.

00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:53.210
No late night at the office, huh?

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:55.929
You know, it's so ironic that the talking

00:42:55.929 --> 00:42:59.250
card for today dealt with putting spiritual things first.

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:00.730
Stand on my face, James.

00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:02.690
Maybe not so much ironic.

00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:06.809
Perhaps a bit more providential.

00:43:06.809 --> 00:43:10.010
I'm sure Jehovah knew you were fit to give that to us.

00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:11.690
Stop it, both of you.

00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:13.010
David, what's gotten into you?

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:14.929
Do you see what I mean?

00:43:14.929 --> 00:43:18.969
This is exactly what I am talking about.

00:43:18.969 --> 00:43:23.570
I am done being cross-examined and scrutinized.

00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:27.050
I'm moving into my own place with people that I approve of,

00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:31.480
and I'm answering for myself.

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:33.639
You know, just let me go.

00:43:33.639 --> 00:43:35.559
He deserves whatever he gets.

00:43:35.559 --> 00:44:03.320
I've been into my friend.

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:05.199
Here, let me help you so that, thank you.

00:44:05.199 --> 00:44:08.079
There's still a lot in the car, which is probably

00:44:08.079 --> 00:44:14.829
part of the league.

00:44:14.829 --> 00:44:16.230
Oh, what do you think?

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:17.789
Pretty cool, huh?

00:44:17.789 --> 00:44:20.670
David, welcome.

00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:21.349
Hey, come on in.

00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:22.550
Make yourself at home.

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:23.789
Nice.

00:44:23.789 --> 00:44:28.269
He, uh, here's the first month's rent.

00:44:28.269 --> 00:44:37.559
Fantastic.

00:44:37.559 --> 00:44:39.920
All right, so the kitchen is there.

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:43.840
Here we have Anton's girlfriend, Jessica.

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:45.760
Jessica, this is David.

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:47.599
The newest roommate, hey.

00:44:47.599 --> 00:44:49.079
Hey, it's nice to meet you.

00:44:49.079 --> 00:44:50.079
Same.

00:44:50.079 --> 00:44:51.840
You want a beer?

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.079
I'm OK, thanks.

00:44:53.079 --> 00:44:55.960
All right, enjoy the tour.

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:59.760
Anyway, as we have the bathroom here,

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:04.219
this is Anton's room?

00:45:04.219 --> 00:45:07.820
Wait, does, does Jessica live here?

00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:11.900
No, she's just a frequent house guest.

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:15.150
She's hot, isn't she?

00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:19.039
And this is my room.

00:45:19.039 --> 00:45:19.880
Nice.

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:21.880
It's a work in progress.

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:27.199
And finally, last but not least, drum roll, please.

00:45:27.199 --> 00:45:30.079
Ta-da, your bedroom.

00:45:30.079 --> 00:45:31.880
You like?

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:38.309
Ooh, did I deserve the luxury suite?

00:45:38.309 --> 00:45:40.710
With a view.

00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:42.110
Hey, Mr. Glass, half empty.

00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:44.110
How about you focus on what you're getting?

00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:45.789
This is yours.

00:45:45.789 --> 00:45:46.909
Can't put a price on that.

00:45:46.909 --> 00:45:48.630
If I checked, what says you can?

00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:50.949
I have a jump chain soon enough.

00:45:50.949 --> 00:45:51.989
Oh, my car.

00:45:51.989 --> 00:45:52.750
Come on.

00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:54.309
Hey, and I told Anton about the little house

00:45:54.309 --> 00:46:00.489
warming party next week.

00:46:00.489 --> 00:46:05.010
I still can't believe it's $115 for double parking.

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:09.559
There, we should be synced up.

00:46:09.559 --> 00:46:10.320
Ah, yeah.

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:11.760
Party spreadsheet.

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:14.320
Now, what we got to do is fill with names.

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:17.119
Again, who cares how much money he makes?

00:46:17.119 --> 00:46:18.840
You deserve better than that.

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.280
Girl, I would have put the final nail in that coffin

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:23.440
a long time ago if I was in New York City.

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:25.360
He bought me these shoes, actually.

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:27.559
Very funny.

00:46:27.559 --> 00:46:31.360
Sea Taylor, this is what makes our team so great.

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:34.639
Devoted employees, working through lunch.

00:46:34.639 --> 00:46:36.639
OK, what are you really up to?

00:46:36.639 --> 00:46:38.559
A little house warming party next weekend,

00:46:38.559 --> 00:46:40.639
and it just so happens that we have openings

00:46:40.639 --> 00:46:42.119
for a number of attractive females.

00:46:42.119 --> 00:46:44.400
About 70 to be precise.

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.079
Well, count me in.

00:46:46.079 --> 00:46:47.519
Did you say next weekend?

00:46:47.519 --> 00:46:48.960
I think we have plans, then.

00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:49.920
Could I get back to you on that?

00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:53.039
Serious Taylor, you've got to move on from him.

00:46:53.039 --> 00:46:53.880
You're right.

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:54.400
You know what?

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:56.199
I could do this in series drinking myself.

00:46:56.199 --> 00:46:57.000
Good choice.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.159
There will be plenty of that.

00:46:58.159 --> 00:46:59.360
I can't assure you.

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:00.000
Mark him down.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.079
Ah, yeah, I kept it.

00:47:02.079 --> 00:47:03.800
Hey, Phillips.

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.159
Big party, huh?

00:47:05.159 --> 00:47:07.000
Lots of booze, really?

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.280
Yeah, well, guest list is a little tight,

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:12.239
otherwise I'd invite you.

00:47:12.239 --> 00:47:15.300
Not likely.

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:17.019
Say, ow.

00:47:17.019 --> 00:47:18.659
Your buddy David here told me the other week

00:47:18.659 --> 00:47:22.860
that you two are Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:23.980
Yes, so.

00:47:24.019 --> 00:47:25.380
Interesting.

00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:27.179
I never knew that.

00:47:27.179 --> 00:47:29.139
You know, my wife talks about the Bible

00:47:29.139 --> 00:47:30.260
with a witness woman.

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:31.340
She comes by the house.

00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:32.619
That's great, Will.

00:47:32.619 --> 00:47:34.460
Can't say I agree with them.

00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:36.980
But what I've been hearing about Jehovah's Witnesses

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:39.219
and what I know about you, well,

00:47:39.219 --> 00:47:44.320
let's just say there seems to be a discrepancy.

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:50.289
That's all.

00:47:50.289 --> 00:47:53.690
OK, was that just me or was it a very odd conversation?

00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:56.329
No, that was definitely odd.

00:47:56.329 --> 00:47:57.849
Forget him, he's crazy.

00:47:57.849 --> 00:48:00.130
You told me that you were a Jehovah witness.

00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:01.369
Yeah, that's right.

00:48:01.369 --> 00:48:03.409
Maybe we shouldn't talk about religion at work.

00:48:03.409 --> 00:48:05.769
Don't be silly, we're at lunch.

00:48:05.769 --> 00:48:06.769
I had some neighbors.

00:48:06.769 --> 00:48:07.929
They were Jehovah's.

00:48:07.929 --> 00:48:09.730
No offense, nice people.

00:48:09.730 --> 00:48:11.570
Just a little too devoted.

00:48:11.570 --> 00:48:12.969
Well, they live what they believe.

00:48:12.969 --> 00:48:14.250
What do you believe?

00:48:17.289 --> 00:48:20.570
Well, we believe that God's name is Jehovah.

00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:22.809
His son is Jesus Christ.

00:48:22.809 --> 00:48:24.969
Humans will be restored to perfection

00:48:24.969 --> 00:48:26.769
and live forever on a paradise earth.

00:48:26.769 --> 00:48:28.690
And that the dead will be resurrected.

00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:30.570
That's just scratching the surface, really.

00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:32.329
Wow, that's some heavy stuff.

00:48:32.329 --> 00:48:33.929
You know, I went to church when I was a kid,

00:48:33.929 --> 00:48:36.289
but I can't say remember any of that.

00:48:36.289 --> 00:48:38.929
I vaguely remember that you don't celebrate birthdays.

00:48:38.929 --> 00:48:39.849
Yeah, that's true.

00:48:39.849 --> 00:48:40.929
I was wrong with birthdays.

00:48:40.929 --> 00:48:43.610
We have no problem if other people celebrate theirs,

00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:45.929
but we don't because they have pagan origins.

00:48:45.929 --> 00:48:49.210
And the Bible doesn't really put them in a favorable light.

00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:51.969
Oh, last year when we threw you a party,

00:48:51.969 --> 00:48:53.409
you didn't say anything.

00:48:53.409 --> 00:48:54.690
I don't really make a big deal.

00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:56.329
Pat, that stuff, it's a conscience thing.

00:48:56.329 --> 00:48:58.050
You know, we really should be getting back to work.

00:48:58.090 --> 00:49:00.730
Wait, doesn't your religion punish people

00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:01.969
when they do something bad?

00:49:01.969 --> 00:49:04.570
Well, there are certain things that the Bible condemns.

00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:06.329
And if you get caught, you get a lecture,

00:49:06.329 --> 00:49:08.969
promise not to do it again, cry a few tears.

00:49:08.969 --> 00:49:10.170
It's pretty straightforward.

00:49:10.170 --> 00:49:11.170
It's not like every religion.

00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:13.130
It's not quite like that.

00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:15.849
If someone commits a serious sin,

00:49:15.849 --> 00:49:18.489
confesses it is sorry and doesn't do it again,

00:49:18.489 --> 00:49:20.769
then they lose privileges in the congregation.

00:49:20.769 --> 00:49:22.730
But what if they aren't sorry?

00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:24.769
Or what if they keep doing it?

00:49:24.769 --> 00:49:27.329
Well, then they may get disfellowshipped.

00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:30.690
Wow, you mean like kicked out?

00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:31.610
Not exactly.

00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:33.449
They can still come to congregation meetings.

00:49:33.449 --> 00:49:36.050
They're just not allowed to socialize with anyone.

00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:36.889
Seriously?

00:49:36.889 --> 00:49:38.889
Wow, that sounds a bit extreme.

00:49:38.889 --> 00:49:40.210
I tend to agree.

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:42.050
Well, it may seem that way,

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:45.130
but it's a protection for the people in the congregation.

00:49:45.130 --> 00:49:48.170
And the hope is it will help the person to stop doing bad.

00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:50.090
And if they do, then eventually,

00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:51.809
everyone welcomes them back.

00:49:51.809 --> 00:49:54.929
Wow, I don't know how long I would last in your religion.

00:49:54.929 --> 00:49:56.210
Yeah, it's not for everyone.

00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:58.170
Well, kids, fun time is over.

00:49:58.170 --> 00:49:59.889
Dave, we really should be getting back to work.

00:49:59.889 --> 00:50:01.969
Why don't we see if the conference room's open?

00:50:01.969 --> 00:50:05.820
Okay.

00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:09.949
So what's going on, man?

00:50:09.949 --> 00:50:11.469
What is with you?

00:50:11.469 --> 00:50:12.309
What?

00:50:12.309 --> 00:50:14.469
Why'd you have to bring up all that disfellowshipping stuff?

00:50:14.469 --> 00:50:15.869
And birthdays?

00:50:15.869 --> 00:50:17.030
I didn't bring it up.

00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.550
They did.

00:50:17.550 --> 00:50:19.110
Why didn't you just tell him about Santa Claus

00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:20.710
or the Easter Bunny while you were at it?

00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:21.789
They wanted to know.

00:50:21.789 --> 00:50:23.150
What was I supposed to do?

00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:24.469
Change the subject.

00:50:24.469 --> 00:50:26.590
You can't shove our belief down their throws.

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:28.750
I wasn't shoving anything.

00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:30.829
Listen, talking about religion at work

00:50:30.829 --> 00:50:33.789
is never a good idea.

00:50:33.789 --> 00:50:36.949
Such a turn-off, especially with certain people.

00:50:36.949 --> 00:50:37.989
Like who?

00:50:37.989 --> 00:50:40.909
Pretty much everybody.

00:50:40.909 --> 00:50:42.190
Will Parsons?

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:43.829
What have you been talking to that guy for?

00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:44.510
I don't know.

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:45.909
He was helping me with my computer.

00:50:45.909 --> 00:50:47.190
He seemed like a nice guy.

00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:53.340
Well, looks can be deceiving.

00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:57.260
Listen, you said what you needed to say.

00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:59.420
I just think it's best if we keep our beliefs

00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:04.409
to ourselves from now on.

00:51:04.409 --> 00:51:05.650
And look, I'm sorry about losing it.

00:51:05.650 --> 00:51:09.369
It's all this pressure I'm under.

00:51:09.369 --> 00:51:11.690
Are we cool?

00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:13.769
Yeah, we're fun.

00:51:13.769 --> 00:51:33.079
All right, let's get back to work.

00:51:33.079 --> 00:52:09.440
I'm not going to get started until 10.30.

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:11.719
Ginger tea, it will help settle your stomach.

00:52:11.719 --> 00:52:23.530
Thank you, Han.

00:52:23.530 --> 00:52:28.409
I know it's only been two weeks, but I'm worried.

00:52:28.409 --> 00:52:30.130
Do you think we should call him?

00:52:30.130 --> 00:52:31.250
I did.

00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:33.690
I got his voicemail.

00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:35.570
I think we need to give him a little time

00:52:35.570 --> 00:52:37.329
to sort things out.

00:52:37.329 --> 00:52:41.969
I know our son, his behavior lately,

00:52:41.969 --> 00:52:48.289
that outburst, and that's not the David of six months ago.

00:52:48.289 --> 00:52:51.449
Maybe James is right about now.

00:52:51.449 --> 00:52:54.449
Whether he is or isn't, David's an adult now.

00:52:54.449 --> 00:52:57.010
And he's not under our roof.

00:52:57.010 --> 00:53:00.929
He's making his own choices.

00:53:00.929 --> 00:53:04.969
I was just reading Proverbs 22, 6,

00:53:04.969 --> 00:53:08.610
train up a boy according to the way for him,

00:53:08.610 --> 00:53:13.610
even when he grows old, he will not turn aside from it.

00:53:13.610 --> 00:53:19.730
John, did we do our best to train them?

00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:23.489
You know, we could have always done something different,

00:53:23.489 --> 00:53:26.090
but we trained them by our example

00:53:26.090 --> 00:53:29.289
to put spiritual things first.

00:53:29.289 --> 00:53:30.929
We were always open with them.

00:53:30.929 --> 00:53:35.250
We listened, took them on family vacations.

00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:38.010
We studied with them.

00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:41.590
And we showed them love.

00:53:41.590 --> 00:53:44.429
And you know what else?

00:53:44.429 --> 00:53:50.070
They had the most loving, caring mother in the entire world.

00:53:50.070 --> 00:53:54.829
So yes, we did our best to train them.

00:53:54.829 --> 00:54:48.679
Now it's up to David, not to turn aside as he gets older.

00:54:48.679 --> 00:54:51.559
And so concept design was down to those three final cuts

00:54:51.559 --> 00:54:53.000
as the last night.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.719
Creative is still tweaking some layout options,

00:54:55.719 --> 00:54:57.840
and that's all for our team.

00:54:57.840 --> 00:54:59.639
We aren't target for deadline.

00:54:59.639 --> 00:55:03.599
Thank you, Vivian, and everyone for your reports.

00:55:03.599 --> 00:55:06.119
Folks, you've done some great work

00:55:06.119 --> 00:55:08.800
these last couple of months.

00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:12.920
However, a little reality check is in order.

00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:14.800
There is a whole lot that can go wrong

00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:16.840
between now and our deadline.

00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:21.400
We need to stay sharp and keep our eyes on the price.

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:23.079
So let's keep up the good pace

00:55:23.079 --> 00:55:32.010
and show the big boys incorporate what this branch can do.

00:55:32.010 --> 00:55:33.849
I don't care what it takes.

00:55:33.849 --> 00:55:37.289
I want this done by deadline.

00:55:37.289 --> 00:55:38.849
He is one of our biggest clients.

00:55:38.849 --> 00:55:39.929
It's due by tomorrow.

00:55:39.929 --> 00:55:40.929
I'm sorry.

00:55:40.929 --> 00:58:43.320
OK, you're going to finish this if it takes all night.

00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:44.639
How was your concert?

00:58:44.639 --> 00:58:45.719
It was awesome.

00:58:45.719 --> 00:58:49.480
We had a blast, except for when some guy threw up on me.

00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:50.320
Ooh, gross.

00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:51.559
Did you get the email?

00:58:51.559 --> 00:58:52.880
Yeah, what's that all about?

00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:53.480
Good news.

00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:54.159
I'm sure.

00:58:54.159 --> 00:58:56.119
You're going to want to look your best tomorrow.

00:58:56.119 --> 00:58:57.639
We all have to put on a good show.

00:58:57.639 --> 00:58:58.159
Really?

00:58:58.159 --> 00:59:00.480
Do me a favor, get this to Al, please.

00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:02.400
Yeah, absolutely.

00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:06.599
Oh, um, have you seen Taylor today?

00:59:06.599 --> 00:59:09.159
She called me on Saturday and said she needed Monday

00:59:09.159 --> 00:59:11.679
and Tuesday off.

00:59:11.679 --> 00:59:15.599
All right, thanks.

00:59:15.599 --> 00:59:16.679
Sure.

00:59:16.679 --> 00:59:18.519
Absolutely.

00:59:18.519 --> 00:59:19.760
I'll have it ready.

00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:21.000
Sure thing.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.239
Well done.

00:59:22.239 --> 00:59:23.960
Hey, bro, did the email?

00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:25.800
Yeah, that sounds exciting.

00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:26.760
Yeah, it's not everyday.

00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:29.519
Corporate makes a special house call.

00:59:29.519 --> 00:59:32.119
Word on the street is that they are ecstatic about all

00:59:32.119 --> 00:59:33.679
business and branch brought in.

00:59:33.679 --> 00:59:35.280
What do that mean for us?

00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:36.239
My guess?

00:59:36.239 --> 00:59:38.760
They beef up our budget and we all get fat bonus.

00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:41.000
By, we all does that include me?

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:41.760
Oh, I'm sure.

00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:43.159
And you're probably going to raise, too.

00:59:43.159 --> 00:59:44.679
That would be awesome.

00:59:44.679 --> 00:59:46.679
I have a killer credit card bill overdue.

00:59:46.679 --> 00:59:47.639
Yeah, I have no worries.

00:59:47.639 --> 00:59:50.239
By next month, your compass shall run it over.

00:59:50.239 --> 00:59:53.550
That's a scripture, isn't it?

00:59:53.550 --> 00:59:57.110
Hey, did you know that Taylor was taken today and tomorrow?

00:59:57.110 --> 00:59:58.349
I saw that.

00:59:58.349 --> 01:00:02.190
Probably got Brad and Tuna the weekend with her ex-boyfriend.

01:00:02.190 --> 01:00:07.960
Come on, what do you expect to fall you do

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:09.559
as drink coffee and flirt with her?

01:00:09.559 --> 01:00:11.000
Can you blame her?

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.320
I'm not ready for a serious relationship anyway.

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:15.000
Who said anything about serious?

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.239
It's just fun, you know?

01:00:16.239 --> 01:00:18.599
That's what office romance is are.

01:00:18.599 --> 01:00:21.320
Here, take this to Viv, tell her it's perfect.

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:22.239
And cheer up.

01:00:22.239 --> 01:00:24.480
By tomorrow, we'll all be riding high.

01:00:24.480 --> 01:01:41.230
All right.

01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:43.190
Hi, Mr. Benson.

01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:43.710
Yes, sir.

01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:45.030
I'll be right in.

01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:45.630
All right.

01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:51.239
Thank you.

01:01:51.239 --> 01:01:52.280
You want to see me, sir?

01:01:52.280 --> 01:02:03.659
David, have a seat, please.

01:02:03.659 --> 01:02:07.300
You have been a great part of the team.

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:09.579
For someone who came here with no experience,

01:02:09.579 --> 01:02:12.139
it's been a real pleasure watching you learn the ropes.

01:02:12.139 --> 01:02:14.860
And I think you have a great future ahead of you.

01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:16.300
I really mean that.

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:17.099
Thank you, sir.

01:02:17.099 --> 01:02:21.409
I appreciate that.

01:02:21.409 --> 01:02:24.210
That's why what I have to say is very difficult.

01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:26.530
I just found out from corporate that are transferring

01:02:26.530 --> 01:02:30.170
several accounts to the West Coast Office.

01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:33.090
I have no choice but to cut staff.

01:02:33.090 --> 01:02:39.510
Unfortunately, I have to let you go.

01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:43.909
What?

01:02:43.909 --> 01:02:45.750
I don't understand.

01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:46.269
I know.

01:02:46.269 --> 01:02:51.800
I know these things are never easy.

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:53.519
When?

01:02:53.519 --> 01:02:56.440
The company policy is pretty strict.

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.760
It's effective immediately.

01:02:58.760 --> 01:02:59.880
Now, you haven't been here long,

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:01.480
but I can probably arrange for you

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:04.320
to get two weeks' evidence.

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:05.840
Two weeks.

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:07.599
Listen, if anything opens up in the future,

01:03:07.599 --> 01:03:09.639
I'll keep you in mind.

01:03:09.639 --> 01:03:15.750
And please, feel free to use me as a reference.

01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:18.190
How could this happen?

01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:19.750
What went wrong?

01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:20.590
I don't know.

01:03:20.590 --> 01:03:21.670
Was I supposed to be this way?

01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:22.630
I had no idea.

01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:24.829
I mean, all this time I've been putting in,

01:03:24.829 --> 01:03:27.989
I've devoted my whole life to this company.

01:03:27.989 --> 01:03:29.710
Look, Dave, we'll get you another job.

01:03:29.710 --> 01:03:31.070
I know people at other places.

01:03:31.070 --> 01:03:33.710
In this economy, are you kidding me?

01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:35.230
I can't believe this.

01:03:35.230 --> 01:03:36.230
Come on, come down.

01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:38.869
That's easy for you to say you still have a job.

01:03:38.869 --> 01:03:40.989
You're not broke.

01:03:40.989 --> 01:03:44.070
I have $5,000 in credit card debt.

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:49.119
I couldn't even pay my car insurance last month.

01:03:49.119 --> 01:03:51.400
It's supposed to be getting a raise, not fired.

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:52.760
Come on, I'll help you with something.

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:53.960
Maybe get you through a couple weeks.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:56.480
I can loan you some of my bonus.

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:59.000
You got a bonus?

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:08.550
What'd you get a promotion to?

01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:12.139
Yes, yes, he's here.

01:04:12.139 --> 01:04:13.340
Yes, sir.

01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:15.420
Yes, sir, I'll get it to you as soon as possible.

01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:17.460
OK, bye.

01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:19.139
Listen, I got to get this report to Mike.

01:04:19.139 --> 01:04:28.639
I'll take it for drinks later.

01:04:28.639 --> 01:04:33.699
I'm sorry, bro, it's company policy.

01:04:33.699 --> 01:05:20.920
Mr. Barker, could you come with me to your desk?

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:24.519
Remember, don't tell anyone you're unemployed.

01:05:24.519 --> 01:05:26.679
Tell them you're in transitional.

01:05:26.679 --> 01:05:28.920
Don't worry, I got friends with other companies.

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:30.800
I'll make some calls when I have some time.

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:32.000
Time?

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.320
Dude, I don't have time.

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:36.119
Hey, come on, have a little faith.

01:05:36.119 --> 01:05:37.519
Trust me, we'll get you something.

01:05:37.519 --> 01:05:38.760
Trust you.

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:40.960
That's exactly what I did and look where it got me.

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.519
Whoa, easy, pal.

01:05:43.519 --> 01:05:44.960
I got you in.

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:47.320
I set you up, didn't I?

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:56.480
Let's just go home, OK?

01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:58.800
You should show me more appreciation than that.

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:01.559
Believe it or not, this isn't about you.

01:06:01.559 --> 01:06:05.400
Do me a favor and just stop talking.

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:06.480
I shouldn't drive.

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:07.280
We can take the train.

01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.559
I'll get my car in the morning.

01:06:08.559 --> 01:06:09.239
Train?

01:06:09.239 --> 01:06:10.840
At this hour, what are you crazy?

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:12.559
Fine, we'll take a taxi.

01:06:12.559 --> 01:06:13.360
A taxi?

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:14.960
You barely had anything to drink?

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:15.800
I had enough.

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:16.800
I'm not driving.

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:17.960
Fine.

01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:19.960
I'll drive.

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:22.320
That's not a good idea and you know it.

01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:23.760
Come on, give me my keys back.

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:25.440
Look, maybe you don't know how to handle your liquor,

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:28.039
but I, dude, you're starting to sound like my mother.

01:06:28.039 --> 01:07:18.260
Just get in the car.

01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:20.099
Dude, you totally just ran a red light.

01:07:20.099 --> 01:07:21.619
It just turned red.

01:07:21.619 --> 01:07:23.260
There wasn't even a car in sight.

01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:40.239
Why don't you stop whining?

01:07:40.239 --> 01:07:42.719
I do not believe this is perfect.

01:07:42.719 --> 01:07:45.559
I told you we should have taken the train.

01:07:45.559 --> 01:07:46.320
What are you doing?

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:47.320
Why are you speeding up?

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:48.880
Far enough ahead I can lose him.

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:49.960
Are you out of your mind?

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:51.639
I'm not about to lose my license.

01:07:51.639 --> 01:07:54.320
We should have thought of that before we took my keys.

01:07:54.320 --> 01:08:00.800
Come on, man.

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:02.800
Just pull over.

01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:13.750
Does this car have anything in it?

01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:14.630
I concentrate.

01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:15.230
On what?

01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:56.539
Get it, let's kill him.

01:08:56.539 --> 01:08:56.979
Who cares?

01:08:56.979 --> 01:08:57.619
I'll pay for it.

01:08:57.619 --> 01:08:58.380
We got to go.

01:08:58.380 --> 01:08:59.979
We're not going to run my place.

01:08:59.979 --> 01:09:00.939
They'll know it's mine.

01:09:00.939 --> 01:09:02.100
I've poured it stolen.

01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:03.260
I'm not going to do that.

01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:31.560
Come on, we've got to go now.

01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:32.520
Check the car.

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:33.039
Check the car.

01:09:33.039 --> 01:09:37.470
Show me your hand.

01:09:37.470 --> 01:09:45.069
Give me your left hand.

01:09:45.069 --> 01:10:42.840
Right hand back.

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:48.579
David Barker, security cameras,

01:10:48.579 --> 01:10:50.500
corroborating your story.

01:10:50.500 --> 01:11:59.659
Your buddy's been arrested.

01:11:59.659 --> 01:12:29.989
It's David.

01:12:29.989 --> 01:12:31.189
I'll did that.

01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:33.960
What was he thinking?

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:36.039
I don't know.

01:12:36.039 --> 01:12:38.319
I've never seen him like that.

01:12:38.319 --> 01:12:40.319
Well, hopefully you can get a good lawyer

01:12:40.319 --> 01:12:42.600
and sort everything out.

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:44.880
Yeah, in the hope so.

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:48.359
Sure, he'll think of something in his owl after all.

01:12:48.359 --> 01:12:50.000
Sure.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.239
What about you?

01:12:51.239 --> 01:12:55.569
What are you going to do now?

01:12:55.569 --> 01:13:01.350
I guess start by getting a job, any job.

01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:04.590
And other than that, I'm not sure.

01:13:04.590 --> 01:13:07.109
You're a talented, honest, hardworking guy.

01:13:07.109 --> 01:13:08.670
Something is going to come your way.

01:13:08.670 --> 01:13:09.510
I know it.

01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:10.670
Don't worry.

01:13:10.670 --> 01:13:11.510
Thanks.

01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:40.539
I just wish that I had the same confidence.

01:13:40.539 --> 01:13:42.819
Tell her, thank you for letting me

01:13:42.819 --> 01:13:44.619
use your dryer and having me over.

01:13:44.619 --> 01:13:45.460
Yeah, of course.

01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:46.899
I appreciate it.

01:13:46.899 --> 01:13:48.140
But it's getting late.

01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:49.100
I probably should go.

01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:50.220
No, that's crazy.

01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:51.899
It's pouring outside.

01:13:51.899 --> 01:13:53.300
It'll just get soaked.

01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:55.140
You could stay here until it stops.

01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:56.260
It could rain all night.

01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:57.020
I should get going.

01:13:57.020 --> 01:13:57.699
That's OK.

01:13:57.699 --> 01:13:59.140
You could sleep on the couch if you have to.

01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:02.420
You are not going out in this.

01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:05.260
Well, then, I guess the decision has been made for me.

01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:06.579
It has.

01:14:06.579 --> 01:14:17.689
Besides, we still have this bottle of wine to finish.

01:14:17.689 --> 01:14:20.770
You sure you want to hang out with an ex-convict?

01:14:20.770 --> 01:14:24.890
I'll broke unemployed carless ex-convict at that.

01:14:24.890 --> 01:14:27.449
You've got unjello stalker.

01:14:27.449 --> 01:14:28.170
Oh, yes.

01:14:28.170 --> 01:14:30.289
How can I ever forget that?

01:14:30.289 --> 01:14:31.210
Get it right, David.

01:14:31.210 --> 01:14:32.569
You think I should put that on my resume?

01:14:32.569 --> 01:14:33.409
Oh, definitely.

01:14:33.409 --> 01:14:34.210
Consider it done.

01:14:34.210 --> 01:14:35.729
No.

01:14:45.569 --> 01:14:47.489
Seriously, though.

01:14:47.489 --> 01:14:57.399
I'm really going to miss working with you.

01:14:57.399 --> 01:15:00.829
I'm going to miss you, too.

01:15:00.829 --> 01:15:03.710
But it doesn't mean we can't still see each other, right?

01:15:03.710 --> 01:15:04.510
No, come on.

01:15:04.510 --> 01:15:05.909
That doesn't have to change.

01:15:05.909 --> 01:15:18.479
We'll still see each other.

01:15:18.479 --> 01:15:24.319
David, please don't go home tonight.

01:15:24.319 --> 01:17:11.460
So sorry.

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:57.670
Assa did was shocking.

01:17:57.670 --> 01:18:00.189
But was he a lost carless?

01:18:00.189 --> 01:18:03.670
Was he beyond hope?

01:18:03.670 --> 01:18:08.979
Let's read Second Chronicles chapter 33, verse 12.

01:18:08.979 --> 01:18:12.220
And as soon as he caused him the stress,

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:16.939
he softened the face of Jehovah his God.

01:18:16.939 --> 01:18:19.420
Jehovah forgave my answer.

01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:23.180
What can we learn from that?

01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:27.260
When a person sends, even seriously,

01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:31.380
and shows true repentance by abandoning his wrong cause

01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:34.699
and making every effort to do what is right,

01:18:34.699 --> 01:18:37.899
he's not a lost cause.

01:18:37.899 --> 01:18:41.100
He's not beyond hope.

01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:44.340
I'm a loving God, Jehovah.

01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:47.619
We'll forgive him in a large way.

01:18:47.619 --> 01:19:05.130
Well, looks like we're going to be working indoors one more day.

01:19:05.130 --> 01:19:06.689
Better get to bed.

01:19:06.689 --> 01:19:09.449
Well, don't forget, honey, trash pickup is tomorrow.

01:19:09.449 --> 01:20:28.720
That's right.

01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:37.520
I missed you so much.

01:20:37.520 --> 01:21:08.079
So, son.

01:21:08.079 --> 01:21:12.399
How are you feeling?

01:21:12.399 --> 01:21:17.439
I'm upset, nervous.

01:21:17.439 --> 01:21:21.359
I'm so disappointed in myself for bringing

01:21:21.359 --> 01:21:25.119
a reproach on Jehovah's name.

01:21:25.119 --> 01:21:27.960
Son, if your heart is condemning you,

01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:31.439
then just remember that the Bible assures us

01:21:31.439 --> 01:21:34.399
that God is greater than our hearts.

01:21:34.399 --> 01:21:37.079
We serve a loving and merciful Father.

01:21:37.079 --> 01:21:44.489
I know, I know, dad.

01:21:44.489 --> 01:21:48.000
What if I get this fellowship?

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.630
I've already caused you and mom so much pain.

01:21:52.630 --> 01:21:57.390
If that happens, then we're going to work with it.

01:21:57.390 --> 01:22:03.550
David, these brothers really care about you.

01:22:03.550 --> 01:22:06.909
So whatever they decide, we need to view it

01:22:06.909 --> 01:22:12.340
as an expression of Jehovah's love.

01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:13.739
Thank you, Dad.

01:22:13.739 --> 01:22:16.100
Thanks.

01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:47.149
I'll be right here when you're done.

01:22:47.149 --> 01:22:49.949
It feels really good to be back in Jehovah's house again.

01:22:49.949 --> 01:23:22.399
A joy of Jehovah is our stronghold.

01:23:22.399 --> 01:23:27.000
His name, all men must come to know.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:31.880
With constant devotion to our God and King,

01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:36.159
God, the joy and service be with you.

01:23:36.159 --> 01:23:37.560
Hey, James.

01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:39.279
Oh, you're doing a good mood.

01:23:39.279 --> 01:23:40.560
What's the special occasion?

01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:42.760
Well, on the way home from service, we thought,

01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:44.119
why don't have a meal for your brother

01:23:44.159 --> 01:23:45.520
and have a few friends over?

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.479
So we're having David's favorites.

01:23:47.479 --> 01:23:51.039
Rose beef, mashed potatoes, green beans, and apple pie.

01:23:51.039 --> 01:23:52.000
Yes.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.720
John, I forgot the whipped cream.

01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:58.239
Could you run to the store and pick some up for us?

01:23:58.239 --> 01:23:59.640
You're kidding me, right?

01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:02.279
Hey, Dad, so I talked to Brother Harper,

01:24:02.279 --> 01:24:04.640
and he said they're going to make it.

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:28.340
Get your own whipped cream.

01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:32.899
So where are you planning to go?

01:24:32.899 --> 01:24:36.090
I don't know.

01:24:36.090 --> 01:24:38.649
Probably a friend's house.

01:24:38.649 --> 01:24:42.609
I just got to get out here for a while.

01:24:42.609 --> 01:24:46.079
I see.

01:24:46.079 --> 01:24:48.479
You know what, Dad?

01:24:48.479 --> 01:24:50.880
I just don't get it.

01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:53.600
I'm the one who sticks with the family business.

01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:56.439
I'm the one who remains faithful.

01:24:56.439 --> 01:24:59.600
I try and do everything right.

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:02.159
No one's singing when I get home.

01:25:02.159 --> 01:25:03.560
No one's throwing me a party.

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:22.130
Son, please, can we just talk for a moment?

01:25:22.170 --> 01:25:25.689
You have stuck with us.

01:25:25.689 --> 01:25:28.329
You have been faithful.

01:25:28.329 --> 01:25:31.569
Your mother and I love you for that.

01:25:31.569 --> 01:25:34.850
I'm so proud of you.

01:25:34.850 --> 01:25:36.050
And it's true.

01:25:36.050 --> 01:25:39.649
Your brother has made some bad choices.

01:25:39.649 --> 01:25:41.729
And he's paying for that.

01:25:41.729 --> 01:25:42.810
But he's back now.

01:25:42.810 --> 01:25:45.130
What choice did he have?

01:25:45.130 --> 01:25:49.010
He spent all of his money doing who knows what?

01:25:49.010 --> 01:25:50.329
You just let him back in.

01:25:50.329 --> 01:25:52.170
He's shown repentance.

01:25:52.170 --> 01:25:54.529
And he's accepting the discipline.

01:25:54.529 --> 01:25:58.010
After what he said to me, what he's done to us, I said,

01:25:58.010 --> 01:25:59.250
I warned him.

01:25:59.250 --> 01:26:00.609
I practically begged him.

01:26:00.609 --> 01:26:03.890
And he just ignored it.

01:26:03.890 --> 01:26:06.449
I'm not buying it.

01:26:06.449 --> 01:26:09.770
I know he's hurt you.

01:26:09.770 --> 01:26:14.010
Your brother was spiritually dead.

01:26:14.010 --> 01:26:17.609
But now he's come back to life.

01:26:17.609 --> 01:26:21.510
And he needs you now more than ever.

01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:25.869
Can't you find some way to forgive him

01:26:25.869 --> 01:26:31.390
and to welcome him back?

01:26:31.390 --> 01:26:35.250
I know that's what I'm supposed to do.

01:26:35.250 --> 01:26:41.640
But I just don't feel that way.

01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:51.439
I'm sorry.

01:26:51.439 --> 01:26:52.439
Did we get on the road?

01:26:52.439 --> 01:26:53.680
I'm going to walk in this house.

01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:54.640
I find the way that is.

01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:55.640
David's picture.

01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:56.439
Is it?

01:26:56.439 --> 01:26:56.960
Yeah.

01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:58.439
I'm going to ask David for the first.

01:26:58.439 --> 01:26:58.960
You better get him.

01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:01.439
We're going to start these potatoes for all they go for.

01:27:01.439 --> 01:27:02.640
Oh, I think it's some of them.

01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:03.640
Sure.

01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:04.640
I don't want to go.

01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:06.119
I don't want that.

01:27:06.119 --> 01:27:06.960
You know what?

01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:08.560
He is doing so well.

01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:11.600
Back today, we got a chance to see that video.

01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:13.680
It was so impressed with that.

01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:31.550
It's really lovely.

01:27:31.550 --> 01:27:32.710
Morning, Mom.

01:27:32.710 --> 01:27:35.869
Well, you certainly are upright and early

01:27:35.869 --> 01:27:37.550
and making breakfast.

01:27:37.550 --> 01:27:39.829
Well, I just wanted to show the greatest moment

01:27:39.829 --> 01:27:41.350
down the world how much I love them.

01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:42.829
Oh, thank you.

01:27:42.829 --> 01:27:43.829
Of course.

01:27:43.829 --> 01:27:45.350
Well, what can I do to help?

01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:45.869
Nothing.

01:27:45.869 --> 01:27:48.069
You and Dad should just finish getting ready for meeting.

01:27:48.069 --> 01:27:49.029
Are you sure?

01:27:49.029 --> 01:27:50.069
Positive.

01:27:50.069 --> 01:27:50.909
OK.

01:27:50.909 --> 01:28:09.800
Well, I could get very used to this.

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:16.000
James, you're home.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.979
Not for long.

01:28:18.979 --> 01:28:23.140
I just had to grab a few things.

01:28:23.140 --> 01:28:28.319
I need to say something.

01:28:28.319 --> 01:28:31.380
I'm sorry.

01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:34.680
You're sorry.

01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:36.520
Yeah.

01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:41.149
I'm sorry.

01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:43.149
Let me cut it with everyone else.

01:28:43.149 --> 01:28:45.310
But not with me.

01:28:45.310 --> 01:28:47.229
I'm not so gullible.

01:28:47.229 --> 01:28:51.510
James, please don't do this to me.

01:28:51.510 --> 01:28:56.359
To you, well, then don't do this to Mom and Dad.

01:28:56.359 --> 01:29:00.390
We can't keep putting them through this.

01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:01.670
Well, you should have thought that months ago.

01:29:01.670 --> 01:29:03.869
I know.

01:29:03.869 --> 01:29:06.869
I know this is on my fault.

01:29:06.869 --> 01:29:11.680
I wish I could go back and do things differently.

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:14.680
Well, the damage is done, isn't it?

01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:15.920
I got to go.

01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:19.470
James.

01:29:19.470 --> 01:29:24.069
David, get out of my way.

01:29:24.069 --> 01:29:28.590
James, I know that sorry doesn't cut it.

01:29:28.590 --> 01:29:32.229
But please, just one minute.

01:29:32.229 --> 01:29:36.140
Just to hear me out.

01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:40.319
For all the bad things that I've done,

01:29:40.319 --> 01:29:46.130
and I know now how much you cared about me,

01:29:46.130 --> 01:29:53.899
how much you loved me, and I didn't care.

01:29:53.899 --> 01:29:55.579
I wouldn't listen.

01:29:55.579 --> 01:30:04.260
You were right about so many things.

01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:11.289
But now I'm asking you, as the one that I used to look up to,

01:30:11.289 --> 01:30:16.210
as the one that taught me how to swing a hammer, James,

01:30:16.210 --> 01:30:23.640
I'm asking you, as the one that taught me to beat me, James,

01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:30.470
I'm asking you, is your little brother?

01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:35.859
Please forgive me.

01:30:35.859 --> 01:30:44.720
Because if you can't, I can't live with myself.

01:30:44.720 --> 01:31:26.100
Sorry.

01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:27.300
Careful, bro.

01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:28.500
Don't mess up your clothes.

01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:36.720
I'm good.

01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:38.119
I should be good now.

01:31:38.119 --> 01:31:39.239
Won't you fish get ready?

01:31:39.239 --> 01:31:43.439
How do I mind if I've plenty of time?

01:31:43.439 --> 01:31:44.760
Breakfast is ready.

01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:45.520
Yes.

01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:47.359
We should have everything roughed in for you

01:31:47.359 --> 01:31:49.720
by tomorrow morning latest.

01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:52.119
Exactly.

01:31:52.119 --> 01:31:52.960
All right then.

01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:54.159
We'll see you.

01:31:54.159 --> 01:31:54.880
Thank you so much.

01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:56.720
Bye-bye.

01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:59.359
Honey, after we leave, could you call the township

01:31:59.359 --> 01:32:02.600
and have them schedule the inspector for Friday?

01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:03.680
Sure.

01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:04.920
What about Ed Brewster?

01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:06.760
When do you need him next week?

01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:09.199
I'm going to need him a few days, so let's wait

01:32:09.199 --> 01:32:10.680
and see what the boys have scheduled first.

01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:11.680
It's great to meet you.

01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:13.479
Mom, those are the things.

01:32:13.479 --> 01:32:16.199
My mom is really good.

01:32:16.199 --> 01:32:17.520
Oh, did you want to call Johnny and Mel?

01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:18.800
See if they can play some ball tonight?

01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:21.720
Yeah, actually, I'm supposed to work out

01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:23.840
in service of Johnny this morning, so I'll ask him.

01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:25.840
And then I'll call Mel at lunch.

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:28.640
And then I'll check to make sure the courts are open.

01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:30.960
OK, so David, what's your schedule

01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:32.000
looking like for next week?

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.560
Well, I was hoping to go out in service on Wednesday and Friday

01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:36.880
and then plan in to work the other days.

01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:38.279
Perfect, how about you, James?

01:32:38.279 --> 01:32:41.000
Well, if I go out on Monday, I'll have my time for the month,

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.159
so I can start work Tuesday.

01:32:43.159 --> 01:32:44.640
Good.

01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:46.479
Well, that's good, because I'll need both of you

01:32:46.479 --> 01:32:48.840
to help me finish the punch list at the Mitchell House,

01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:51.279
and then I can call for the final inspection.

01:32:51.279 --> 01:32:53.800
You're telling me you got your time in for the month already?

01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:55.399
How'd you manage that?

01:32:55.399 --> 01:32:56.960
All in the scheduling, bro.

01:32:56.960 --> 01:33:00.199
Start early in the day, early in the week, early in the month.

01:33:00.199 --> 01:33:03.239
And early in the year, that's what everyone's been saying.

01:33:03.239 --> 01:33:05.199
I hope I can make it work.

01:33:05.199 --> 01:33:06.520
I know you will.

01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:09.560
When you start pioneering, we'll make a good team.

01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:11.039
Yeah, we will.

01:33:11.039 --> 01:33:14.170
I'm looking forward to it.

01:33:14.170 --> 01:33:17.960
James, you want to read our theme text this morning?

01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:21.039
Staying from 1 Corinthians 13, 13.

01:33:21.039 --> 01:33:25.720
Now, however, the remained faith, hope, love, these three.

01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:29.119
But the greatest of these is love.

01:33:29.119 --> 01:33:32.840
So it looks like we're talking about love this morning.

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:34.199
David, you want to read our comments?

01:33:34.199 --> 01:33:36.359
Sure.

01:33:36.359 --> 01:33:38.680
Now, among Jehovah's people today,

01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:44.000
we see the wisdom of pursuing the surpassing way of love.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:48.600
Truly, it excels in any and all situations.

01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:52.399
Note how the Apostle Paul emphasized that truth.

01:33:52.399 --> 01:33:57.800
He concluded, now, however, their remained faith, hope, love,

01:33:57.800 --> 01:33:59.319
these three.

01:33:59.319 --> 01:34:01.960
But the greatest of these is love.
