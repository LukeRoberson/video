00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.050
Good morning.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.049
Sorry I was running a little behind this morning,

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:35.049
but at least I come bearing gifts.

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:37.049
Oh, no worries, thank you.

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:41.420
I could really use it today.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.420
Were you also thinking about that announcement

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.420
about the special preaching campaign?

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.780
Yeah, yeah it was.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.780
Don't take what I'm gonna say the wrong way, but

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.780
don't you think the message will be preaching is pretty harsh?

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:14.859
No, I wouldn't say that, but it's definitely very direct.

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:20.859
I mean, people already get defensive whenever you challenge their beliefs,

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:23.859
and this is gonna be next level.

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:27.859
This isn't gonna be the easiest message to deliver,

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:30.859
but you know, it's not the first time we've done this.

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:31.859
Really?

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:32.859
Absolutely.

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:37.859
I don't know if you remember me telling you that my family's originally from Quebec,

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:42.859
and my dad was part of an incredibly hard-hitting witness back in the 40s.

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:46.140
I looked this up last night.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.140
He had to distribute a tract that called out the local religious leaders as hypocrites.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.140
What were they doing?

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.140
They were inciting their followers to mob violence against the witnesses,

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.140
telling them to vandalize our properties,

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.140
even getting brothers falsely arrested and imprisoned.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.140
Wow.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.139
And they had to distribute that tract during the violence.

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:12.139
They had to.

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:17.139
Jehovah wanted to show how unjust their actions were,

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:26.150
but I remember my dad telling me he said that initially he was pretty terrified.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.150
Yeah, I mean, that's how I feel.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.150
I'm terrified.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.150
It's normal to feel that way.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.150
I've been thinking about it myself,

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.150
and I thought of an account in Exodus.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.150
It's where Moses tells the Israelites

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.150
to splatter the blood of a ram on their doorposts

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.150
in order to avoid the effects of the last plague.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.150
And I thought about how some of the Israelites

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.150
might have felt about doing that back then.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:06.900
Every family.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.900
Rams are sacred to the Egyptians.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.900
Yeah, this would be an affront to Amonron.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.900
How are the Egyptians going to react?

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.580
I know, I've thought about that too.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.580
Does Moses know what he's asking us to do?

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:36.599
Brothers, I don't know if we have anything to worry about.

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.599
We don't have anything to fear.

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.599
Think of how Jehovah's protected us with these last legs.

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:53.539
And as for the blood, it's not a matter of offending them.

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:55.539
It's a matter of protecting us.

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:59.819
It's showing whose side we're on.

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:07.639
Jehovah's side.

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:13.639
Looking back what the Israelites did was actually good news.

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:15.639
It meant their deliverance.

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:19.639
And it's the same with any message we bear today.

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.639
Let me show you one of my favorite scriptures.

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.920
Isaiah chapter 41, verse 10.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.920
It says, Do not be afraid for I am with you.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.920
Do not be anxious for I am your God.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.920
I will fortify you. Yes, I will help you.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:45.990
I will really hold on to you with my right hand of righteousness.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.990
The fear we feel is natural.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:55.990
But remember, Jehovah was with the Israelites.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.990
He was with my dad.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.990
And he will be with us.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.990
The message we are sharing is good news.
