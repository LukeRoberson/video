00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.570
warning examples for our day. That is the drama you're about to see.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:21.320
Warning examples are what the Apostle Paul speaks about in his first letter to

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.839
the Corinthians chapter 10. He refers to events that happened some 3,500

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:34.880
years ago. Then he makes an urgent appeal to all Christians. He says that such

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.780
examples were written for a warning to us upon whom the ends of the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.439
systems of things have arrived. Some of the events spoken about by Paul are

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:53.460
recorded in Numbers chapter 25. This drama brings them to life before your very

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.799
eyes. You see many in Israel failed a vital test just before entering the

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:07.299
Promised Land. Now we today, in effect, are on the border of inheriting our

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:15.700
future promises. What lessons can we learn from these ancient examples? Pay

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.579
close attention as the drama unfolds, and then we'll take a few moments to

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:28.420
discuss four areas of life that we must give serious attention to today if we

00:01:28.420 --> 00:03:26.280
are to enjoy God's favor. You have peace. My name is Jamin. For 60 years I have

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.479
lived here in the Promised Land. I was born in the wilderness during the days of

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:38.520
Moses during the 40 years of wandering. Honestly, there were times when I

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.319
wondered if we would ever dwell in this beautiful land that Jehovah had promised

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.199
to Abraham. How grateful I am to have experienced the fulfillment of God's

00:03:48.240 --> 00:04:08.150
promises, but I almost didn't make it. There were trials in the wilderness, but for

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.669
me the hardest time was just before we crossed the Jordan to take possession of

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:25.310
this land. We were on the plains of Moab, the Moabites, and the Midianites. We're

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:34.060
afraid of our nation. So they hired a prophet named Balan to curse Israel. You

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:50.410
probably know the story. Jehovah turned Balan's curse into a blessing, but Balan

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:56.810
was a shrewd man. Although he realized that Jehovah would not allow any nation

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:03.970
to destroy us, he also knew that we could bring destruction upon ourselves if we

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:12.730
lost Jehovah's favor. So he proposed a plan to lead us into unfaithfulness. At

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:20.250
the time, we had no idea what they were scheming, yet I well remember how close I

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:27.170
came to being caught up in a situation that brought so many to ruin. The memory

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:33.410
is so clear. Even though it was 60 years ago, I was only in my twenties at the

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:34.410
time.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:47.639
Watch out, you're not the one who flees when you see a real Canaanite Zebda.

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:52.040
That'll never happen, Bela. All the enemies of Israel will follow before us.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.120
That's right.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:01.680
Jamen, what do you think about the women? What women? The Moabite women? You've heard

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.759
about them. Well, I've heard some women have been approaching our camp during the past

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:10.000
few evenings, but I haven't seen them. Well, we haven't either, but there are interesting

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.839
rumors. What have you heard? Well, that they're beautiful. That's what. They're not like

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:24.120
our wilderness women. These women are more sophisticated, and I hear they're very friendly.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.399
What do you suppose they come to our camp while their men stay awake?

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:35.360
Oh, Jamen, that question shows how little you know about women. The reason's obvious.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.680
Everyone's heard how we defeated the Amirites, whose forces were far superior to our own.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:46.439
Sighan and Agh were powerful kings, yet we easily defeated them. The Canaanites are

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:54.920
terrified of us. As I see it, these women are curious. They're interested in real men.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:00.800
Strong, courageous, valiant, and here we are.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:08.800
Was Abdi, it was Jehovah who gave us the victory. Maybe so, but we're the ones who did the fighting.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:15.439
We're invincible. Look, here comes your cousin, Zimray. They say he's talked to the foreign women.

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:18.319
May you have peace, my brother. Zimray. Peace, brother.

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:22.560
Hello, Zimray. We were just talking about the Moabite women. I've heard you've met them.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.920
Tell us about them. So you're interested in our new neighbors. Tell me, what will you pay

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.000
for this information? Tell us everything, Zimray. We'll give you whatever you want.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:41.600
Our most valuable possession. I know. How about two cups, man?

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:47.120
If you're contemptible, Brad, what do you want to know? Everything. What do they look like?

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:52.160
I'll tell you this much, my friends. If we are entering a land of milk and honey,

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:58.000
this will be our first taste of the honey. Someone that can't say these women

00:07:58.079 --> 00:08:03.040
are up to no good. Those who say such things are as blind as a camel in a dust storm.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:08.319
Moab is our sister nation. The Moabites are from the family of Abraham, just as we are.

00:08:08.959 --> 00:08:13.920
We can learn from them. Tell us about the women. Zimray, they don't worship Jehovah.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:19.920
Do they oppose our worship? No, they are a tolerance and reasonable people. They respect our nation

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:25.360
and they respect our religion. Shouldn't we be tolerance and reasonable in return? They've

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.120
proven they want to help us. Haven't they given us bread and water when the other nations

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:35.120
refused? Actually, they sold it to us. That's business. Now help. Tell us about the women.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.840
No matter. They have provided bread and water. It shows they wish us well.

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:47.200
Maybe Jehovah wants us to work with them. We help them and they help us. I tell you,

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:53.440
if we reject our efforts to be friendly, we'll be the losers. You know, I've seen how they live.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:59.679
You've been to their town? When? How? Cosby took me. She's a Midianite woman.

00:08:59.679 --> 00:09:05.679
Her father's a very important man. Wait a moment. You mean Midianite women are coming to the camp too?

00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:10.720
The Moabites and the Midianites? They're friends. You've been spending time with a Midianite woman?

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.679
What of it? Didn't Moses marry a Midianite woman? The daughter of Jethro, a Midianite priest.

00:09:15.679 --> 00:09:19.759
Tell us about the Moabite town. What did you see? I'll tell you this, my brothers.

00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:28.559
These people know how to live. They know how to enjoy life. They have food and wine and music and luxury.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:35.200
It's how I imagine our people must have lived in Egypt. No wonder our grandfathers despise mana.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:41.600
That disgusting bread we've had to eat every day of our lives. Why don't you come with me to the Moabites?

00:09:42.159 --> 00:09:46.960
See these things with your own eyes. They're hospitable people. They will welcome you.

00:09:47.759 --> 00:09:49.519
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:53.519
I haven't finished my teacher's a vitriop. Don't talk to me about Phineas.

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:57.679
Just because his father early A's are as a new high priest, he thinks he can play the prince.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:03.120
We're a new generation and I for one am not going to waste my life like our fathers have.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.000
What do you mean? I mean this. Our grandfathers listen to Moses and Aaron.

00:10:08.639 --> 00:10:13.840
What was the result? They left the luxury of Egypt for a life of a hardship in the wilderness

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:19.120
and in the wilderness they died. Aaron is dead. And Moses is soon to follow.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:24.240
I want something better out of life. I want it now. Me too. So do I. Let's be good neighbors.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.320
Wait a moment. Our forefathers rebelled against Jehovah.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.879
That's why they died in the wilderness.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.480
Zemar, do you think it's a good idea to get involved with these people who don't worship the true guide?

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.039
Jaman, your head is filled with sand. How can someone as stupid as you be my cousin?

00:10:41.919 --> 00:10:45.759
Answer me this. Did Jehovah tell Moses he was driving out the Moabites before us?

00:10:47.039 --> 00:10:49.679
Well, no. Did he say he was driving out the Midianites?

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:55.360
I suppose not. The people that were to be driven out of the Amarites, the Canaanites, the Highvites,

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.840
the Bearites and... I was so confused.

00:10:58.799 --> 00:11:03.200
What Zemar I said about the Moabites seemed to make sense at the time.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:09.679
Not the Moabites, not the Midianites. You see that Phineas has been speaking against Moab,

00:11:09.679 --> 00:11:15.679
that intolerant bull. Go ask him this. If the Moabites are so wicked and so dangerous to be with,

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:22.080
why did Jehovah specifically tell Moses we should not attack them? Put that to your good friend Phineas.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.879
I don't know. Maybe you're right.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.720
He seemed so self-assured as though he had all the answers.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:38.639
But I was disturbed by his attitude. He was so bitter and opinionated.

00:11:55.389 --> 00:12:01.149
I knew that Zemar I didn't really expect me to go to Phineas, but that's what I decided to do.

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:09.230
Here. That was one of the best things I ever did. It probably saved my life.

00:12:13.929 --> 00:12:17.450
Excuse me. Phineas, could I speak with you?

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:24.360
Of course, you, man. Please, sit down. What is your name?

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.519
I'm Jamin of the tribal Samine.

00:12:26.519 --> 00:12:29.559
Jamin, I'm happy to meet you. Is everything alright?

00:12:30.279 --> 00:12:35.480
I'm alright, but a little bit confused. Since you're a priest, a teacher in Israel,

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.799
I was wondering if you can help me. What is it?

00:12:38.519 --> 00:12:41.240
Well, I was wondering how you felt about the Moabites.

00:12:42.039 --> 00:12:46.919
What do you mean? I was thinking about why did Jehovah told Moses we should not fight against them?

00:12:47.639 --> 00:12:49.960
Do you think God wants us to become their friends?

00:12:50.759 --> 00:12:54.360
It's true that Jehovah told Moses that we're not to wage war against Moab,

00:12:55.080 --> 00:13:00.519
but he also explained why. And it's because God has determined that they will have an inheritance

00:13:00.519 --> 00:13:06.440
of land. We are not to take the land given to them. He didn't say anything about becoming their

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:12.200
friends. But is there anything wrong with that? I think you know the answer to that, Jamin.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:20.039
Do they worship the true God? No, they have their own gods. Do they live by the high standards

00:13:20.039 --> 00:13:26.519
containing the law given to our nation 40 years ago? No. Then what makes you think Jehovah would

00:13:26.519 --> 00:13:33.480
want us to be their friends? Well, maybe we can learn from them. Maybe they can help us in some way.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:40.840
And maybe we can help them learn about Jehovah. We'll have to wait and see how Jehovah directs

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:46.360
matters, Jamin. However, when it comes to choosing who are going to become our friends,

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:51.639
we need to be careful. It's true that Moab is not among the nations that we were directed to act

00:13:51.639 --> 00:13:57.399
against, yet the Moabites worship Bale, the same pagan God that the Canaanites worship.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:03.799
Jehovah has clearly warned us that if we seek the friendship of the peoples of this land,

00:14:03.799 --> 00:14:08.679
we risk becoming corrupted by their false worship. And that will bring us Jehovah's

00:14:08.679 --> 00:14:14.279
his favor. Is that what you're saying? That's right. You remember what was written in the tablets

00:14:14.279 --> 00:14:19.399
that Moses brought down from the mountain of God? God's own finger wrote the words,

00:14:19.399 --> 00:14:26.919
you must never have any other gods against my face. For us to serve other gods would be to reject

00:14:26.919 --> 00:14:33.559
the very one who brought us out of Egypt, who made us into a nation, gave us righteous laws,

00:14:33.559 --> 00:14:40.200
and protected and fed us during these 40 years in a wilderness. How can the true God bless us?

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:46.759
If we become ensnared by the false worthless gods of this land. But if a person has strong faith

00:14:46.759 --> 00:14:53.320
in Jehovah, he won't be misled into false worship? Think carefully about that, Jamin. Wouldn't you say

00:14:53.320 --> 00:15:00.039
my grandfather Aaron had strong faith? Yes, of course. He was a high priest. Aaron certainly had

00:15:00.039 --> 00:15:05.240
good reasons for having faith. He stood beside Moses and watched as Jehovah humbled the mighty

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:11.799
pharaoh and proved himself superior to the gods of Egypt. Aaron walked, even as I did, through the

00:15:11.799 --> 00:15:19.159
part of waters of the Red Sea. Yet what happened not long after that? When Moses was in a mountain of

00:15:19.159 --> 00:15:26.360
God, the people, our own people, taught Aaron and through making a golden calf. They began to

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:32.759
celebrate and said that it was a festival to Jehovah. How ridiculous they even bowed down before

00:15:32.759 --> 00:15:39.879
the calf idol. Many lost their lives because of God's pleasure. I'm not sure I see your point.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:47.399
My point is this, Jamin. If Aaron could be learned into false worship by our own people,

00:15:48.279 --> 00:15:54.120
people who witnessed Jehovah's miracles in Egypt, how much more so might we be learned in the

00:15:54.120 --> 00:16:00.039
wrongdoing by those that have not come to know Jehovah at all? We must carefully guard against

00:16:00.039 --> 00:16:05.799
anyone who might endanger a relationship with Jehovah. Think about what is a stake here, Jamin.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:12.120
If we keep Jehovah's laws, our people will be blessed with a higher moral standard than any other

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:18.200
nation. We now stand on a threshold of the land promised to our forefather Abraham. Soon,

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:24.519
we will take possession of it, a land flowing with milk and honey. But wasn't Egypt a land of milk

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:35.279
and honey? Milk and honey, along with cucumbers and watermelons, plates, onions, and garlic?

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:47.179
That's what some people have said. Do you remember Phineas? No, Jamin believed me. Egypt was

00:16:47.179 --> 00:16:53.659
no land of promise. Some became dissatisfied with Jehovah's provisions and grumbled the life in Egypt

00:16:53.659 --> 00:17:00.779
was better. How quickly they forgot. We were slaves in Egypt. Life was terrible, filled with tyranny

00:17:00.779 --> 00:17:07.259
and oppression. The Egyptians were cruel taskmasters who forced us to make bricks for their endless

00:17:07.259 --> 00:17:13.019
building projects. When Moses suggested to Pharaoh that we go into the wilderness and sacrifice to

00:17:13.019 --> 00:17:18.299
Jehovah, Pharaoh oppressed us all the more. Not only did we have to make the same amount of

00:17:18.299 --> 00:17:23.420
bricks as before, but we also had to look for the straw in order to make them. It was an impossible

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:29.819
demand. What did you do? We protested, of course, but they would only scream at us, you're relaxing.

00:17:30.539 --> 00:17:37.339
I was only a boy, but I had to work along with everybody else. I remember one of my young friends.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:18:37.450
He was very weak. His name was Ehai. Only watch helplessly. They knew that if they

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:42.569
dare raise a hand against our oppressors, the punishment would be instant and brutal.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:45.690
That must have been terrible.

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:53.849
Jamin, Jehovah has rescued us from that land. We are a free people now. He has given us his

00:18:53.849 --> 00:19:01.210
laws to guide us and to train us. Now we stand at the frontier of the promised land. Mighty nations

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:05.930
will fight against us, but Jehovah would defeat them just like he defeated Pharaoh and his mighty army

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:13.450
at the Red Sea. However, Jamin, we must be careful to do all that Jehovah has instructed.

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:17.930
If we reject God, he will reject us.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:31.720
What Fennius said was right. I knew that. Still, I was very curious about the foreign women.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.279
Zimri had arranged to meet some of them at the edge of our camp.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:45.880
Sam, Zabdai and Bila were eager to go with him. So I went along just to see for myself.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:20:10.559
And it cost me. It's almost dark. Do you think the Israelite men will really be there?

00:20:10.559 --> 00:20:17.920
I'm sure of it. Zimri will do whatever I ask. He is captive to my feminine charms.

00:20:19.279 --> 00:20:21.759
Do you think we can persuade them to come to the festival tonight?

00:20:21.839 --> 00:20:25.680
We have two. The rulers of Moab and Midian are counting on us.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:32.640
If we can get them to forget their foolish laws on sex or involve them in a worship of

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:39.599
veil, then their God, Jehovah, will fight against them. He will destroy their entire nation.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:47.759
And our men won't have to lift a finger. Then all that they have will be ours.

00:20:47.759 --> 00:20:52.079
I've been told they have gold and silver and beautiful clothes.

00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:59.359
After those ten plates, the Egyptians were so afraid. They gave the Israelites whatever they

00:20:59.359 --> 00:21:06.240
asked for. Soon it will all be ours. If we're successful, we'll be given a generous share.

00:21:07.359 --> 00:21:12.720
What a victory this will be for bail. I still can't believe they have a law that says it's wrong

00:21:13.279 --> 00:21:16.640
to lie with a woman unless you're married to her. It's very restrictive.

00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:21.440
This will be an interesting challenge for us. But not a difficult one.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:27.200
These men know nothing of the pleasures of life. From what Zimri tells me,

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.440
they've only known one type of food all their lives.

00:21:30.079 --> 00:21:36.400
Wasn't it something called mana? Right. These men are so backward. Even a watermelon in

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:46.240
priceless. They know nothing of wine, nothing about our music, and nothing about women.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:51.359
I tell you, my sisters, they are to us as children.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.599
I hear them coming now. We get ready.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.200
That's all I have.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.079
Zimri, my mighty one.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.160
Well, hello.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:18.559
We're happy to see you. We wish you peace. Ladies, these are my friends, Zabdi,

00:22:19.279 --> 00:22:25.599
Jamon, and Bela. This is Cosby. I told you about her. She's an important woman among the

00:22:25.599 --> 00:22:31.519
Midianites, the daughter of the head of a clan. And you are the son of a chieftain.

00:22:33.119 --> 00:22:37.119
Why, Zimri, your friends appear nearly as powerful as you are.

00:22:39.039 --> 00:22:44.480
No wonder the Canaanites tremble before you. These are mighty men.

00:22:45.359 --> 00:22:50.160
We hope your friends will join us at the festival tonight, Zimri. You are coming, aren't you?

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:56.960
You promise. Of course. My friends, let's all go together. Many of our brothers will be there.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:04.960
Yes, do come. We will welcome you with good food, sweet wine, and great music.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:08.559
Sounds good to me. Let's go. I'm ready. What about you, Jamon?

00:23:08.559 --> 00:23:12.640
Well, I don't know. My cousin, he's afraid of women.

00:23:13.599 --> 00:23:17.359
I am not. You're not afraid of me, are you, Jamon?

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:24.640
See how soft I feel on your strong hands? I'm sure your Israelite women don't have hands as

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:30.880
smooth as mine. We'll have a good time. Did your God not promise you the good things of this land?

00:23:32.079 --> 00:23:38.559
Let me be your guide. I'll personally take care of you and protect you from all danger.

00:23:38.559 --> 00:23:43.119
It isn't that. How can I explain? I just don't want to displease my God,

00:23:43.119 --> 00:23:47.359
Jehovah. Jehovah killed our grandfathers in the wilderness. Do you want to die there too?

00:23:47.359 --> 00:23:52.640
Just come with us, Jamon. I don't like that, Zimri. Jehovah did not kill our grandfathers.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:58.400
They died because they were unfaithful. Come with us, Jamon. The music has already begun.

00:23:59.279 --> 00:24:08.619
Leave the wilderness behind. Come. Let's have some wine together.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:18.960
No, I can't. What's wrong with you, Jamon? Your friend is afraid of women.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.920
He's a fool. Forget about him. Let's be on our way.

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:45.339
Go eat your mana. It was not easy to run away from that situation.

00:24:46.779 --> 00:25:07.799
The appeal of having a good time was strong. I was stung by the ridicule of the others.

00:25:07.799 --> 00:25:18.779
Nobody likes to feel like an outsider. When I got back to my tent, I prayed about the matter.

00:25:18.779 --> 00:25:26.779
I kept thinking about what Phineas had said to me. Though I could hear the music of the Moabite

00:25:26.779 --> 00:25:34.059
at a distance, the more I prayed, the more I believed that I had done the right thing.

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:38.539
The events that followed convinced me of that.

00:25:38.539 --> 00:26:23.039
What happened? Everyone's crying. The camp is in turmoil.

00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:26.480
There's good reason to cry. Jehovah Sanga is blazing against these people.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:31.839
But why? The men have gone to the camp of the Moabites and they've had sexual relations with their daughters.

00:26:31.839 --> 00:26:37.599
They've even bowed down to their gods. What honor lack of appreciation for all the good Jehovah has done for us.

00:26:37.599 --> 00:26:40.799
The calamity we spoke about has come upon us. But what can we do?

00:26:41.039 --> 00:26:44.079
We must repent and beg for his forgiveness.

00:26:44.079 --> 00:26:49.440
I have just heard that Jehovah has given a command to Moses and Moses has told the judges of Israel.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.559
Each one of you kill his men who have an attachment with the bail of Pior.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:58.559
How do you feel about this, Jaman? How do whatever Jehovah says could.

00:26:59.359 --> 00:27:04.640
We can only pray that Jehovah's mercy will not depart completely from Israel and that somehow his wrath

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:09.680
will be turned aside. Look, Zimra is coming with a million-night woman.

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:11.440
He's bringing her into the camp of Israel.

00:27:21.849 --> 00:27:24.890
Has he no shame? If this is no, he wants to touch Jehovah.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.039
Give me that spear. I will not tolerate this.

00:27:54.859 --> 00:27:57.980
Phineas killed Zimra and caused by with the lance.

00:27:59.099 --> 00:28:03.099
And Jehovah commended Phineas for his tolerating no rivalry toward God.

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:08.220
Although Jehovah did not exterminate our nation,

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:13.420
some 24,000 did die on that occasion.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:17.660
I could easily have been among them.

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:23.019
Thankfully, Jehovah was merciful.

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:28.910
For me, there were many lessons.

00:28:30.349 --> 00:28:34.750
I learned how seriously wrong it is to worship other gods.

00:28:36.589 --> 00:28:41.390
I also learned the danger of becoming involved with those who do not love Jehovah.

00:28:42.349 --> 00:28:47.309
Zimra had allowed his heart to be corrupted by twisted reasoning.

00:28:49.599 --> 00:28:52.240
The council of Phineas really helped me.

00:28:53.759 --> 00:28:56.559
Though my curiosity almost brought me to ruin,

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:02.240
what he had said helped me to get away before it was too late.

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:26.940
I thank Jehovah that I have lived to relate this story, even to my great-grandchildren.

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:34.410
How grateful I am to have seen the fulfillment of Jehovah's promises.

00:29:47.309 --> 00:29:52.670
The story you have just seen contains a clear warning for us today.

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:59.309
As noted at the outset, the Apostle Paul said at 1 Corinthians 10-11,

00:30:00.269 --> 00:30:03.470
now these things went on, befalling them as examples,

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:11.069
and they were written for a warning to us upon whom the ends of the systems of things have arrived.

00:30:12.589 --> 00:30:14.029
Paul adds in verse 12,

00:30:15.069 --> 00:30:18.589
let him the things he is standing beware that he doesn't fall.

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:25.789
Hence, none of us should ever take for granted our precious relationship with Jehovah.

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:31.390
Rather, we should remember that our faithfulness to God is being tested.

00:30:32.509 --> 00:30:40.460
How Satan tries to influence us in subtle ways to disobey Jehovah and lose his favor.

00:30:41.099 --> 00:30:48.140
The drama highlighted how Israel's faithfulness was tested in four areas of life.

00:30:49.099 --> 00:31:05.609
Attitude, associations, morals, and worship. First of all, some of the Israelites had developed

00:31:05.609 --> 00:31:12.410
a wrong attitude towards Jehovah himself. Do you remember how Zimri felt about the man

00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:19.529
provided by Jehovah? He called a disgusting, but he should have known better.

00:31:20.569 --> 00:31:24.970
Earlier, when rebellious Israelites called the man a contemptible bread,

00:31:25.769 --> 00:31:33.740
the divine decision was immediate and severe. Today, the example of Zimri alerts us

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:39.660
to never develop a complaining attitude toward God and its theocratic arrangements.

00:31:40.539 --> 00:31:45.900
Verse 9 reminds us not to put Jehovah to the test.

00:31:47.339 --> 00:31:53.180
Instead, may we strive to reflect contentment and promote peace,

00:31:54.140 --> 00:32:02.859
such a natitude will result in God's approval. The second point has to do with our associations.

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:09.819
Do you recall the conversation between Jaman and Phineas about the Moirbites?

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:14.940
Yes. Jaman asked if there was anything wrong with befriending them.

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:23.339
In turn, Phineas asked if they worshiped the true God. The answer, of course, was no.

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:29.259
Phineas then explained the friendship with the Moirbites was dangerous.

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:35.819
He could lure the Israelites into wrongdoing and ruin the relationship with God.

00:32:36.779 --> 00:32:43.819
Before long, Phineas warning was proved right. The Israelites who ignore the danger of bad

00:32:43.819 --> 00:32:52.700
associations were induced to commit unfaithfulness towards Jehovah. Consequently, they lost their lives.

00:32:54.299 --> 00:32:59.500
Clearly, our associates influence us for better or for worse.

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:06.140
The Bible states that he, that is walking with wise persons, will become wise.

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:11.579
But he, that is having dealings with the stupid ones, will fare badly.

00:33:13.019 --> 00:33:26.779
May this drama move us to choose our friends wisely. The third area of concern is morals.

00:33:27.019 --> 00:33:34.220
Bad association led Zimrain as companions to engage in serious sin.

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:39.420
They started to have immoral relations with the daughters of Moirb,

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:46.940
provoking Jehovah's Anger. Referring to this very incident, Paul Warnes,

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:52.539
neither let us practice fornication as some of them committed fornication.

00:33:53.339 --> 00:33:56.940
Only to fall 23,000 of them in one day.

00:33:58.619 --> 00:34:06.220
How sad it is that some of God's servants today still let themselves be lured into committing immorality.

00:34:07.579 --> 00:34:12.059
And what is often the start of such sin? In the drama,

00:34:13.019 --> 00:34:18.139
Jameen admitted that his curiosity nearly brought him to ruin.

00:34:19.099 --> 00:34:26.699
Yes, curiously viewing pornography, or mingling with those who do not live by God's standards,

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:31.420
often is the first step leading towards serious wrongdoing.

00:34:32.539 --> 00:34:36.139
However, the drama showed how we can protect ourselves.

00:34:36.539 --> 00:34:43.659
When Jameen was tempted, his response was that he did not want to displease Jehovah.

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:52.940
It is encouraging to see that as a whole, God's people today share Jameen's heart-felt desire.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:03.039
Now as to the fourth and final point, the Israelites were tested as to the purity of their worship,

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:10.800
and many failed that test. When the Moabite women came calling the people to the sacrifices

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:16.800
of their gods, says the Bible record, the people began to eat and bowed out of their gods.

00:35:18.239 --> 00:35:23.280
Because of this grave sin, Jehovah's Anger blazed against them.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.000
How could they so blatantly betray Jehovah? Clearly, they lacked appreciation.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.440
For all that Jehovah had done in their behalf.

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:41.599
Yes, heart-felt appreciation for Jehovah's goodness should impel us

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:56.460
never to become idolaters. Granted, it is unlikely that we will ever turn to outright idle worship.

00:35:58.139 --> 00:36:01.739
We should be aware, though, of the more subtle forms of idolatry.

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:10.539
The Apostle Paul reminds us of Colossians 3.5, that one could become an idolatry by allowing

00:36:10.539 --> 00:36:15.820
his own selfish desires to distract him from whole soul worship of Jehovah.

00:36:17.739 --> 00:36:25.260
May we be determined to avoid this danger by giving Jehovah our exclusive devotion.

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:34.059
Now, the warning examples captured in this drama remind us that our faithfulness to God is being

00:36:34.059 --> 00:36:40.300
tested. Nevertheless, each one of us can maintain our faith in the four areas discussed.

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:50.699
How? Our appeal to all true Christians is take to heart the lessons learned from the examples

00:36:50.699 --> 00:36:57.260
in God's word. Strengthen your precious relationship with Jehovah, and in so doing,

00:36:58.219 --> 00:37:03.659
secure your place in God's future land of promise.
