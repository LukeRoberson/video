00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.710
I remember when I was a little girl.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:17.109
My grandmother and I would often go to a nearby temple to worship.

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:23.629
What I disliked the most was looking at the gods inside the temple.

00:00:23.629 --> 00:00:28.789
Their faces looked so fierce, stern and cold.

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:34.869
Those hideous statues made me feel very uncomfortable.

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:42.710
Many years later, when I had a family of my own, I really wanted to know God.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.829
But I didn't know how.

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:55.399
My heart was very empty and I felt life had no meaning.

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:05.760
One day, on a quiet afternoon, I sat by the window and looked up at the sky.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:18.540
At that moment, I prayed, oh Lord, God, where are you?

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.250
Do you exist?

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.049
Please tell me.

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.849
Not long after that, the doorbell rang.

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:33.049
I went to open the door and I saw a woman, a missionary.

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:40.799
On that very day, I accepted a Bible study.

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:47.140
I learned that Jesus had a purpose in coming to the earth.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:57.140
He came as God's representative, the way Jesus treated people.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:05.859
He was so humble and full of love and tenderness.

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:12.610
He was merciful and compassionate and he loved justice.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.050
So that made me think about what I saw in the temple when I was little.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:27.610
Compared to those scary, stern and cold statues, the difference was like night and day.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.210
I decided to become one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:43.979
By coming to know Jesus, I have come to know the best, most loving Father in the world,

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:46.340
Jehovah God.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:54.689
I have become more positive and my life is full of meaning.

00:02:54.689 --> 00:03:01.490
So when I go out to preach, I really hope that everyone can learn these precious truths

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:24.340
like I have and that all can enjoy a happy, healthy life, beautiful paradise earth forever.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.979
I welcome and encourage all to come and learn this precious truth.
