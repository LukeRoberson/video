00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.099
I had a stable job at a local resort, but I later lost this job.

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.099
I tried to look for work, but I was unsuccessful.

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.099
My savings ran out.

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.100
We had run out of money to buy a gas for cooking.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.670
It felt like my world had ended.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.670
I did some research in publications.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.670
I found that I was able to follow the example of some brothers

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.670
who had found that they were able to start businesses using these schemes

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.670
and abilities that they had.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.670
I was able to use a fishing net that I owned by going down to the sea,

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.670
to the river, put the net out in the evening.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.670
Early in the morning I would go down and be able to find fish and crabs on the net.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.670
It was not easy.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.670
I did not always get a good catch, but by doing this,

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.299
eventually I was able to support my family during the time.

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:05.299
We had to cook outside on a fire.

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.299
I thought about how I could help my family to stay positive.

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:16.299
We would sit together, and we would sing kingdom songs, play games together,

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:21.870
and I feel that Jehovah blessed the efforts that I made.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.299
He brews 13 of us five.

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.299
That scripture reassured me that,

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.299
as long as I didn't compromise the important aspects of Jehovah's worship,

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.299
my family's needs were cared for.

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:43.480
I have always admired the beauty and power of the sea.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.480
It reminds me that the one who created the sea,

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.480
it's not hard for him to care for, just one small human like me.
