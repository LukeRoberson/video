00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.299
Imagine the astonished look on the faces of the apostles.

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.500
The resurrected Jesus stands before them on the Mount of Olives.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.000
Just before he disappears into the clouds,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.500
Jesus makes this profound declaration as recorded at Acts 1-8.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.500
You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you,

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.500
and you will be witnesses of Me in Jerusalem,

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:34.500
in all Judea and Samaria, and to the most distant part of the earth.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.500
What an assignment!

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.500
They were to preach the good news of God's kingdom throughout the earth.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:48.500
Those disciples must have felt overwhelmed and wondered how such a small band of preachers

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.500
could ever get this work done.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.500
Ten days later, they received the promised Holy Spirit, and they got to work.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.500
True, they faced many challenges, but that did not stop them.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.500
Three years passed, and the preaching work was expanded to include Gentiles.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.500
We can read the moving account in Acts chapter 10.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.500
First, an angel of God appears to the God-fearing army officer Cornelius.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.500
Then Peter responds to the leadings of God's Spirit to go to the officer's home.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.500
There, Peter gives a thorough witness about Jesus,

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.500
not only to Cornelius, but also to his family and friends.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:43.500
As he concludes his discourse, Peter explains the commission he received to be an evangelizer.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:52.500
Let's open to Acts 10-42, and note the two main aspects of the preaching work started by Jesus.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.500
Also, he ordered us to preach to the people, and to give a thorough witness,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.500
that this is the one decreed by God to be judge of the living and the dead.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.500
First, Jesus commanded his disciples to preach to the people.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.500
In addition, they were to give a thorough witness.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.500
The disciples were to search out honest-hearted deserving ones.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.500
That would require a thorough coverage of their territory.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:32.500
In spite of vicious persecution, Christians in the first century obeyed Jesus' command to preach and to bear thorough witness.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:39.500
And by about 60 of our common era, less than 30 years after the Christians had received their commission,

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:48.500
Paul could write to the congregation in Colossi that the good news had been preached in all creation under heaven.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:03:00.500
What a testimony to the power of God's Holy Spirit, and the faith, zeal, and determination of those early disciples.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:08.500
In the late 1800s, a small group of Bible students rose to the challenge of bearing thorough witness.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:18.500
An article in the April 1881 issue of Zion's Watchtower had the thrilling title, Wanted 1,000 Preachers.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:25.500
Today, Jehovah's Witnesses are bearing witness in 240 lands.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.500
But doing so has its challenges.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.500
What are some of those challenges? And what can we do to meet them?

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:43.500
Many of our brothers face the challenge of long distances, climate extremes, rough terrain, and poor travel conditions.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.500
In some areas, just getting to meet people is a challenge.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:04:00.500
To add to the challenge, Revelation 146 reminds us that the good news would be declared to every nation and tribe and tongue and people.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:08.500
This can require learning a new language and understanding different religious, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:15.500
It can mean coping with unresponsive territories, apathy, and poor living conditions.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:21.500
Jesus warned that opposers would try to hinder or stop the preaching work.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.500
No doubt you are facing some form of challenge in your local territory.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.500
We cannot begin to give possible solutions to all the obstacles we face today.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:44.500
But it is helpful to learn how others are coping with their challenges and this can stimulate our thinking to identify ways to meet our challenges.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:52.500
Let's focus on three Bible principles that will help us to carry out our ministry successfully.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:03.500
One, trust in Jehovah. Two, be flexible. And three, stay focused.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.500
How can trusting in Jehovah help us? Consider an example.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:17.500
During the 1990s, Jehovah's Witnesses in France endured an avalanche of negative media reports.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:25.500
As a result of these vicious attacks, some brothers lost their jobs. Witness children were taunted at school.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:31.500
Preaching became extremely difficult in some areas. How did they cope?

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:45.500
The turning point came in January 1999. The governing body approved a special campaign to distribute a magazine-sized tract that exposed all of the accusations as false.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:55.500
Beginning early one Friday morning, witnesses throughout France distributed 12 million copies of the tract in just three days.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.500
This campaign gave them renewed strength and boldness to preach.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:12.500
In the 19 years that followed, there was a continuous increase in the number of publishers and the ranks of regular pioneers swelled to over 15,000.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:22.500
If you constantly face a barrage of negative media reports, does this mean that you need a special campaign to meet the challenge?

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:39.500
Not necessarily. Although the campaign was a stimulus, brothers and sisters in France said that what really gave them strength and boldness were the words of 2 Chronicles 32-8. Let's read it.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:52.500
The setting is in the time of King Hezekiah of Judah. The people were beaten down by the repeated threats and taunts of the Assyrians. What strengthened them?

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.500
Speaking about the King of Assyria, King Hezekiah declared,

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:15.500
with him is an arm of flesh, but with us is Jehovah our God to help us and to fight our battles. What was the result? The people were strengthened by the words of King Hezekiah of Judah.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:22.500
Just hearing this reminder that Jehovah would help them was enough to strengthen the Jews.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.500
Jehovah took action and sent an angel to destroy the enemy army.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.500
Does Jehovah use his angels to help us today?

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.500
Note what we read at Revelation 146.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:57.500
I saw another angel flying in mid-Heaven, and he had everlasting good news to declare to those who dwell on the earth, to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people. Be sensitive to angelic direction and the leadings of God's Holy Spirit.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:06.500
If you feel moved to make that one last call, or to speak to the person next to you on the bus, do it. Speak up!

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:14.500
It may well be that an angel is directing you to one who is rightly disposed for everlasting life.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:23.500
Now let's consider the second Bible principle that will help us to bear thorough witness. Be flexible.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:32.500
Sometimes just getting to talk to people can be a challenge. To overcome this obstacle, we need to be flexible.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:42.500
Takanori and Yumi Takahashi have served in territories that are as different as night and day. Recently they visited our studio.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:51.580
Listen as they tell us how they have learned to meet the challenges of bearing thorough witness.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:09:02.580
Takanori and Yumi, welcome to our studio. Thank you for inviting us, and we're very happy to have you here. Takanori, you and I go back a long way.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:11.580
I still remember when you came into Japan Bethel back in 1977, and we served in the same congregation for a number of years.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:17.580
But then in 1990, you had a big change in your life. Would you like to tell us what happened?

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:23.580
Yes, my twin brother Nubuaki was also serving at Bethel.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:28.580
To our surprise, we were assigned to Papa Nugini as missionaries.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:35.580
That was a big change, and here you are working in the rural territory of Papu Nugini.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:43.580
During your 25 years in Papu Nugini, I understand that you served in the missionary field, in the circuit work, and also at Bethel.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:47.580
So Yumi, when did you come into the picture?

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:54.580
Takanori and I were married in September 1993, and I joined him in the missionary work.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:59.580
Adapting to remote territories such as this was a challenge.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:05.580
So in order to bear thorough witness, what kind of challenges did you have to overcome?

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:12.580
The people of Papa Nugini are very friendly. They have a deep respect for the Bible.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:21.580
It was easy to relax. Speak to them face to face, to read the scriptures together, and read with them.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:25.580
Those don't sound like challenges. Did you face any obstacles?

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:35.580
When we preached in the villages, the response of the local people often depended on the response of the village chief.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:46.580
If he listened, almost the whole village listened. But if his response was negative, the people would walk away and hide in the bush.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:52.580
So we would always show respect and approach the village chief first.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:57.580
This often, move him to view our visit with favor.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:01.580
Challenging the cities was mainly security.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:08.580
It wasn't safe for us to go into some areas alone or to visit homes regularly.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:15.580
So we would ask our Bible students to come to the Kingdom Hall for their study before the meeting.

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:20.580
That was a good way to encourage them to attend meetings.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:29.580
Well, it's obvious that you enjoyed your service in Papu Nugini. But now you're serving as special pioneers in the Myhama congregation.

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.580
Just 20 minutes from downtown Tokyo.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:36.580
So you went from a territory where people have deep respect for the Bible.

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:41.580
To a land where less than 1% of the people claim to be Christian.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:49.580
So what other kind of differences did you find between your territory in Japan now and your missionary territory?

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.580
Oh, it's very different.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.580
Tokyo Disneyland is in our territory.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:12:01.580
And 70% of homes are in high security apartment buildings.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:09.580
We have to stand in the lobby, in front of the dormant, pressure button, and speak to our camera.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:15.580
Coming from Papu Nugini, we found it challenging to work this territory.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:19.580
We were used to friendly discussions face to face.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.580
Now we see only the lens of a camera.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:27.580
But we have learned to view the camera as our friend.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:32.580
As your friend, I think most of us find it challenging to speak to a camera.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.580
So how do you overcome this challenge?

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:42.580
We know that, as soon as we push the button, our face shows up on the screen inside of the apartment.

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:49.580
We stand on arm lengths from the camera so that our face is framed nicely.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:57.580
And we adjust our volume accordingly, taking into consideration the dormant and others who may be listening.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:03.580
We say our greeting about two seconds after we push the button.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.580
Just when we know that they are looking at the monitor.

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:14.580
Our friendly greeting and one smile makes them feel like we can actually see their face.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:23.580
We prepare a specific appealing introduction and show them respect and consideration.

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:31.580
The people in our territory like to be viewed as successful, not as people who have problems.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:35.580
So we try to focus on positive subjects.

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:42.580
We prepare a variety of subjects so that they don't hear the same message over and over.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:47.580
Like many people, Japanese do not like to be put on a spot.

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:52.580
So instead of asking a question and waiting for them to answer,

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:59.580
we use the teaching method of our trucks and give three possible answers for them to choose from.

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:04.580
Well, have you had positive results from this intercom preaching?

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:10.580
Since we started to use this method, the number of note homes has decreased.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:17.580
And also, when we meet people on the street, sometimes they say they know us.

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:20.580
Because they saw us on their intercom.

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.580
That was excellent.

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:28.580
And thank you Takanori and Yumi for sharing with us how you have met the challenge of bearing thorough witness

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:32.580
in a variety of territories.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:37.580
1 Corinthians 9, 22 and 23.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.580
Let's read it.

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:43.580
I have become all things to people of all sorts,

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:48.580
so that I might by all possible means save some.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:55.580
But I do all things for the sake of the good news in order to share it with others.

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:59.580
Become all things. Do all things.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:02.580
In other words, be flexible.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.580
Apply the suggestions in the meeting workbook.

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:09.580
Get well acquainted with each tool in the teaching toolbox.

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:15.580
Observe how experienced publishers and pioneers use those tools.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:20.580
Understand the feelings and circumstances of people in the territory.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:25.580
Even in the same territory, we may need to use a variety of approaches.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:34.580
For example, about 40% of the apartment buildings in the Takahashi's territory do not allow the witnesses to enter the lobby.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:38.580
So they do public and informal witnessing to reach those people.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:42.580
Now let's consider the third Bible principle.

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.580
Stay focused.

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:48.580
At Matthew 6.22, Jesus said,

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.580
The lamp of the body is the eye.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:57.580
If then your eye is focused, your whole body will be bright.

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:06.580
Keeping our eye focused means keeping our life simple in order to concentrate on spiritual matters.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:13.580
Distractions take our attention and energy away from our responsibility to bear thorough witness.

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:19.580
Before we can teach those who are rightly disposed for everlasting life, we have to find them.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:30.580
We leave no stone unturned as we search for them at their homes, on the streets, in parks, in stores, and at the workplace.

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:35.580
There's no on-off switch for our preaching work.

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:41.580
Our preaching switch must be on at all times.

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:47.580
Not only do we look for opportunities to preach, but we also make opportunities.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:52.580
What if our efforts to find interested ones are not fruitful?

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:58.580
Jesus did not say that every human must become a disciple before the end comes.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:05.579
Rather, He said that the end will come after the good news has been preached in all the inhabited earth,

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:09.579
and a witness has been given to all the nations.

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:13.579
The Apostle Paul stayed focused on his ministry.

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:21.579
May we imitate his positive attitude expressed at Acts 20-24.

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:27.579
Nevertheless, I do not consider my own life of any importance to me

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:34.579
if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus

00:17:34.579 --> 00:17:41.579
to bear thorough witness to the good news of the undeserved kindness of God.

00:17:41.579 --> 00:17:46.579
The opportunity to bear thorough witness will soon be over.

00:17:46.579 --> 00:17:55.579
May we use the remaining time effectively to search for deserving ones and to teach them the truth.

00:17:55.579 --> 00:18:01.579
Imitate the faith of Hezekiah and trust in Jehovah.

00:18:01.579 --> 00:18:05.579
Learn from the Apostle Paul and be flexible.

00:18:05.579 --> 00:18:10.579
Obey Jesus' direction and stay focused.

00:18:10.579 --> 00:18:16.579
Then you too can meet the challenge of bearing thorough witness.
