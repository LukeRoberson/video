WEBVTT

00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:04.570
Jehovah is on my side.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.089
I will not be afraid."

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:14.449
One of the most encouraging expressions in God's inspired word, Jehovah is on my side.

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:17.329
It reminds me when I was growing up in school.

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:22.649
We would pick teams in the playground to play basketball or other sports, and two students

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:27.609
would be selected as captains, and then they would begin picking alternating back and forth

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.929
to make up their team.

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.530
One of the captains was usually more skilled than the other, and you always wanted to be

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.729
on his team.

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:40.049
If you were picked on his team, that was a good day.

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:41.850
Life was good.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.210
Well our scripture today is telling us that we have Jehovah on our side.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.929
We are on his team.

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:53.810
That guarantees victory, success.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.810
We cannot lose.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.729
We have many beautiful examples in the Bible of those who were victorious with Jehovah

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:03.210
on their side.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.409
David facing Goliath, exciting and resounding victory.

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.409
But what about other victories?

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.730
What about Stephen facing the mob that stoned him to death?

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:23.650
It may not seem to be a victory at the moment, but where is Stephen now?

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.819
A incredible victory for him.

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:35.700
Well this is the result of Jehovah's promise at Isaiah 54, verse 17.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.140
Isaiah 54, verse 17, just the first part of the verse there.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.459
So comforting.

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:47.459
No weapon formed against you will have any success.

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:50.459
So we keep Jehovah on our side.

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:52.060
We win.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.379
Unfortunately though, we don't always feel like that winner.

00:01:57.379 --> 00:02:03.780
For some of us, it might happen when we have to wait for Jehovah to answer our prayer.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.139
We might become impatient, begin to wonder if even heard our prayer.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:09.740
Is he still on my side?

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.180
Where is his attention elsewhere?

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.819
Or perhaps it's not that we doubt Jehovah being on our side.

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.300
We have complete confidence in him.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.219
But when we're awaiting an answer for our prayers, we have laid out our situation before

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:27.580
Jehovah.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.979
Now we're waiting to discern his answer.

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:36.219
And maybe that's not as clear to us as we wish it would be or thought it would be.

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:39.139
We begin to have doubts.

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:42.419
Are we even able to recognize his answer?

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:48.500
We begin to lose confidence not in Jehovah, but in ourselves, in our discerning his help.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.300
So what can help us?

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:57.300
Well, we need to remind ourselves that Jehovah has a bigger picture and perceives things

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.060
that obviously we don't see.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.419
We need to keep a spiritual outlook on life and to stay focused on what's really, truly

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:07.659
matters.

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:15.409
When we're caught up in the moment of the anxiety, it begins to look like we're losing.

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:21.210
But even then, Jehovah remains on our side.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.090
He's looking down the path further than we are.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.210
He sees the victory.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.210
So what's the lesson for us?

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.409
We need to just calm down and wait on Jehovah.

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:38.569
The victory is guaranteed.

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:44.129
And other times, it may seem that we just, as it were, cannot get out of our own way.

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.289
We make so many mistakes.

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:47.770
We're imperfect.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:54.729
We have a health crisis or time and unforeseen circumstances devastates us.

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:57.810
At those moments, it seems like we're losing.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.729
But wait, wait, Jehovah is still on our side.

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:05.969
He is not looking at the score today as it were.

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:11.129
He's looking again to the future, the final score, to the future victory we will have.

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:13.409
So stay in the game.

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:18.720
Keep Jehovah on your side, trust in him.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.439
Of course, we want Jehovah on our side every moment of the day.

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:30.199
But are there times when we feel that we especially need Jehovah on our side?

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:34.920
Many have said it's times when they have to make a heavy or weighty decision.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.920
They really need Jehovah on their side.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.240
They need to feel the reassurance that Jehovah is with them in their decision.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.959
We need that reassurance to help resolve perhaps some fears that we have that we're going

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:50.240
to make a poor decision.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.079
We're going to have negative consequences due to not making a good judgment or good decision

00:04:56.079 --> 00:04:57.519
here.

00:04:57.519 --> 00:05:02.480
Or perhaps it's a fear that we will not be able to apply the principles that we know the

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.480
principles that bear on our decision.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.560
But how do we apply them?

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.360
We struggle with their application.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.560
Do we hope that Jehovah is on our side?

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.000
No, we know Jehovah is on our side.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.480
So if we pray and we meditate and we do our research, we can be confident that we can

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:29.480
make the right decision based on his principles, it will be the winning decision.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:35.399
Do you sometimes feel alone when confronted with a heavy decision that needs to be made?

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:41.199
I appreciated this insight from a faithful sister who said, I found that I need Jehovah

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:44.079
in all areas of my life.

00:05:44.079 --> 00:05:50.879
As a single sister, with not having a head, I feel like everything I do or any decision

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:55.279
I make, I need to present it to Jehovah.

00:05:55.279 --> 00:06:01.240
And when I do that, I feel like when the hard times come, then I don't hesitate to talk

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.600
to Jehovah about it.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:10.360
So sensing that Jehovah is on her side, she has talked to Jehovah about her decisions.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:16.439
And then when things don't go so well, she can easily keep talking with Jehovah to work

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:21.240
her through whatever difficulties they may be.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.360
Another situation, suppose our assignment has separated us from our family, we're here

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.480
at Bethel, we're in the construction field or a circuit over seers.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:37.560
Now as time goes on, our family might need extra help or attention or concern.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.800
Are we making the right decisions regarding our involvement in their care?

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.160
That's a difficult question.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.879
Well again, we can feel safe remembering that Jehovah is on our side.

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:57.519
He always has been and he will be there at the right time with the right help for whatever

00:06:57.519 --> 00:07:03.439
the situation may be, especially for those situations that are out of our control.

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:05.519
He's on our side.

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:09.680
Of course, Jehovah can only help us as much as we let him.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:15.720
So we need to make sure that we take advantage of his being on our side.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.360
What do we mean by that?

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:32.310
Take a look over at Psalm 25, we'll look at verse 15, my eyes are always toward Jehovah

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:37.459
for he will free my feet from the net.

00:07:37.459 --> 00:07:43.180
So now we need to picture our feet entangled in a net that you've been there.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:47.300
Perhaps it's not a net, maybe you'd get your feet tangled up in a rope or something.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.899
But let's stick with the scripture.

00:07:48.899 --> 00:07:51.579
It uses the example of a net.

00:07:51.579 --> 00:07:57.540
Picture that and if you're on your own, how are you going to get untangled out of the net

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.540
as it were?

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.779
Or you're going to look down to your feet and you're going to start to wiggle and finally

00:08:01.779 --> 00:08:04.019
free yourself.

00:08:04.019 --> 00:08:08.540
But is that taking advantage of Jehovah being on our side?

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:16.560
You notice the verse said, your eyes should be toward Jehovah, not solving the problem

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:21.839
ourselves, looking at our own feet as it were, but look up to Jehovah, past him the

00:08:21.839 --> 00:08:23.160
ball as it were.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.439
He's the most skilled player on our team.

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:28.600
Let Jehovah help us.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:33.460
He can get us untangled from anything.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:39.419
Now before leaving the subject, remember that Jehovah is not just on your side.

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:43.980
In a more powerful way, Jehovah is on the side of the faithful and discrete slave, our

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.379
governing body.

00:08:45.379 --> 00:08:53.220
So we stick to them because Jehovah is on their side and they will always be winners.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:58.899
For example, when the pandemic erupted, we were instructed to stop going to the kingdom

00:08:58.899 --> 00:08:59.899
hall.

00:08:59.899 --> 00:09:04.700
We were given some direction on our public ministry.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.980
It was radically changed from what we knew it.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.779
What courageous decisions by the governing body.

00:09:11.779 --> 00:09:13.860
But Jehovah was on their side.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:19.899
He blessed the adjustments and we, as an organization, came off victorious.

00:09:19.899 --> 00:09:25.980
Certainly, no weapon formed against them will have success.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.500
But there's something even more powerful to imagine.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:36.940
Jehovah stands mightily on the side of his son, our reigning king, Christ Jesus.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:42.379
I know all of us would be thrilled to have Jesus on our side, but Jehovah is standing

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:48.860
right there with him alongside our Lord and King Jesus.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.940
Do you see that?

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.259
Do you see them teamed up?

00:09:52.259 --> 00:10:01.559
Can you imagine the power, our confidence in the future has such power behind it.

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:04.159
It's hard to even imagine to put it into words.

00:10:04.159 --> 00:10:08.159
I tried and my imagination doesn't go that far.

00:10:08.159 --> 00:10:13.480
So our scripture, Psalm 118, verse 6, what an encouraging text for us today.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.919
Jehovah is on my side.

00:10:15.919 --> 00:10:18.000
I will not be afraid.
