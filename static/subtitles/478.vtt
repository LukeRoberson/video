00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.769
The Scriptures do not say specifically

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:10.769
that the devil fathered any of the Nephilim.

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.769
But Jesus' words, at John 8.44,

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.769
reveal the fact that the devil does indeed have children

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:19.769
figuratively speaking.

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.769
He can't create humans,

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.769
but he can influence people

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.769
to reflect his characteristics.

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.769
And that is what makes them his children.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.770
Turn with me to John 8.44.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.770
We'll read the entire text.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.770
Jesus' words, knowing that

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.770
the religious leaders were out to kill him,

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.770
Jesus' words points out who their father is.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.770
John 8.44, Jesus said,

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.770
you are from your father, the devil,

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.770
and you wish to do the desires of your father.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.769
That one was a murderer when he began,

00:01:05.769 --> 00:01:08.769
and he did not stand fast in the truth,

00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:11.769
because truth is not in him.

00:01:11.769 --> 00:01:14.769
When he speaks the lie,

00:01:14.769 --> 00:01:17.769
he speaks according to his own disposition,

00:01:17.769 --> 00:01:20.769
because he is a liar

00:01:20.769 --> 00:01:23.769
and the father of the lie.

00:01:23.769 --> 00:01:25.769
According to the text, at one time,

00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:28.769
he was in the truth.

00:01:28.769 --> 00:01:30.769
But he had free will,

00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:32.769
and he toyed with wrong thinking,

00:01:32.769 --> 00:01:35.769
to such a degree that it eroded

00:01:35.769 --> 00:01:36.769
anything that was good

00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:38.769
and nothing good was left within him,

00:01:38.769 --> 00:01:40.769
and he made himself

00:01:40.769 --> 00:01:43.769
into the father of the lie,

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:45.769
Satan the devil.

00:01:45.769 --> 00:01:50.769
Now, if we had Jesus' words with what John wrote,

00:01:50.769 --> 00:01:53.769
at 1 John 3 verse 10,

00:01:53.769 --> 00:01:57.769
we can identify specific characteristics

00:01:57.769 --> 00:01:59.769
of the children of the devil

00:01:59.769 --> 00:02:02.769
and the children of Jehovah God.

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:04.769
Let's read that together.

00:02:04.769 --> 00:02:07.769
1 John 3 verse 10.

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:10.770
It states, the children of God

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.770
and the children of the devil

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.770
are evident by this fact.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.770
Whoever does not practice righteousness

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.770
does not originate with God,

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.770
nor does the one who does not love his brother.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.770
We must practice righteousness,

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.770
but it's not self-righteousness.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.770
We don't establish what is righteous for ourselves.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.770
It's Jehovah's righteousness.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.770
Isn't that what Jesus said in Matthew 6.33?

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.770
Keep on seeking the kingdom

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.770
and his righteousness.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.770
The standards that Jehovah God has set for us.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.770
That is what righteousness is.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.770
And one of the points about being righteous

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.770
and serving God is that we are no part of the world.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.770
And what's interesting about that idea

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.770
is that there are many people in the world

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.770
who think they are righteous.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.770
They set their own standards.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.770
There are people who believe

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:10.770
they're practicing righteousness

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.770
as they set about to bring about social justice

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.770
or remove injustices in the political,

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.770
the commercial, the economics of this world.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.770
They want to see justice for all.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.770
No more racial inequality

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.770
and so many other items they follow through on

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.770
to remove from this world scene today.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.770
And they feel that they truly are being righteous.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:45.199
When it appears, though, that one injustice is removed

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:48.199
and it only appears that way in many cases,

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:51.199
isn't there always another one that comes up?

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:55.199
Aren't there a multitude of injustices in this world?

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:58.199
It makes me think about a long-time faithful servant of Jehovah

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:01.199
who was approached by a group of men

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.199
who criticized Jehovah's Witnesses

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:06.199
because we don't get involved in working against

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:11.199
the social injustices of this world.

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:14.199
Our brother who was known for being straightforward

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:18.199
and outspoken said that what these men were doing

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:22.199
in their fight against injustices in the world,

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:26.199
they were battling against spider webs.

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:29.199
Injustices were like spider webs

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.199
and they would fight in battle

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.199
and they would demonstrate to bring down a spider web

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:39.199
but another spider web was being woven, being spun

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:44.199
or maybe the same one in many cases just come up again

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.199
and it just continues on and on that way

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.199
and then he looked at the men and he said,

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:54.199
but we are going to get the spider Satan the Devil,

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:57.199
you're after the webs, what he produces,

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.199
you've got to go to the source

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:02.199
and see that the spider is eliminated

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:05.199
and it's Jesus Christ who's going to abyss

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:09.199
Satan the Devil, the spider who's spinning all of these things

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:14.199
to distract people from the real issue about God's kingdom

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:17.199
and serving Jehovah wholeheartedly.

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:21.199
That spider will be thrown into the abyss.

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:24.199
No more spider webs.

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.199
Truly, the devil's lie to Eve

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:30.199
about becoming like God, knowing good and evil

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:33.199
has had far-reaching consequences that affect people

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:36.199
more than ever right down to this day.

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:38.199
We see it.

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:40.199
The world's attitude.

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:41.199
They're independent.

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:42.199
You don't need God.

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:45.199
We don't need to be guided by scriptural principles

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:46.199
what the Bible says.

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:49.199
You decide for yourself how you want to live.

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:51.199
There are no moral standards.

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:53.199
You fix your own standards.

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:56.199
Isn't that precisely what Satan told Eve?

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:57.199
You can be like God.

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:59.199
You decide what's good, what's bad,

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:02.199
what's right for you and not right.

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:06.199
And if you're so sophisticated and so wise

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.199
we can fix our problems.

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:09.199
Oh, really?

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:11.199
We look at the world scene today.

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:13.199
Are they really fixing the problems?

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:16.199
What do we really see happening?

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:17.199
It's out of control.

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:22.199
The entire world scene is out of control.

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:27.199
The world in its wisdom prefers the lie

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:30.199
even though they don't recognize the liar.

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:35.199
They still prefer the lie instead of recognizing their need

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:37.199
for Jehovah God.

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:40.199
And the outcome for the world is stated for us

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:43.199
at Jeremiah chapter 8 verse 9.

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:45.199
The wise have been put to shame.

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:48.199
They have become terrified and they will be caught.

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:52.199
Look, they have rejected the word of Jehovah

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:55.199
and what wisdom do they have?

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:59.199
But you know, you might ask the question, why?

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:03.199
Why are people so determined to go their own way?

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:06.199
What's wrong with their thinking?

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:10.199
There are various reasons, but there is one that truly stands out

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:15.199
and the Apostle Paul spoke about it at 2nd Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 10.

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:18.199
And this is what Paul said in part.

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:21.199
He tells us that people will perish

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:27.199
because they did not accept the love of the truth

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:29.199
in order that they might be saved.

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:32.199
Yes, the love of the truth.

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:34.199
People really don't love truth.

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:37.199
They want to make up their own truths, which are lies.

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:39.199
They're not truths.

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:42.199
We must accept the love of the truth.

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:45.199
And it's really quite wonderful that Jehovah has made the truth

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:48.199
in such a way that it appeals to our heart

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:51.199
as will as to our head.

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:54.199
Think about the time when Jesus taught the truth

00:07:54.199 --> 00:07:58.199
to his disciples who were walking on their way to Emmaus.

00:07:58.199 --> 00:08:00.199
Remember how they responded?

00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:03.199
It's at Luke 24, 32.

00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:06.199
They said, we're not our hearts burning

00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:09.199
as he was speaking to us on the road

00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:13.199
as he was fully opening up the scriptures to us.

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:16.199
And I found a very interesting comment

00:08:16.199 --> 00:08:19.199
in the watchtower on this verse.

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:24.199
It's the watchtower of 1962, April 15, page 227.

00:08:24.199 --> 00:08:26.199
This is what it said.

00:08:26.199 --> 00:08:30.199
Only when we have real love for the truth

00:08:30.199 --> 00:08:35.200
will we go through the experience of burning hearts.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.200
Isn't that fascinating?

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:42.200
Think about when your heart has burned,

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.200
when you've observed a drama,

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.200
when you heard an encouraging talk,

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:53.200
when you sang a wonderful kingdom song.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.200
Think about the Hezekiah drama

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.200
when we saw the angel spread his wings

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.200
facing the Assyrian troops

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.200
and then devastation came.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.200
Didn't your heart burn?

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:12.200
Or we think about when armed troops were stealthily advancing

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.200
on our brothers in an open field.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.200
And then in the opened up heavens,

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.200
we see Jesus on a white horse with bow in hand,

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.200
ready to take vengeance on those who hate Jehovah.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.200
That's a reality foretold in scripture.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.200
That fires the heart.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.200
And there are other things that fire our heart.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.200
When we hear beautiful songs that are meaningful,

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.200
such as, never alone,

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.200
or give me courage and many others,

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:47.200
the heart that loves Jehovah does indeed burn.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.200
And this is not just emotion.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.200
Our thinking ability and our emotions work together

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.200
and motivate us to know and to feel the power of the truth.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.200
As the watchtower I quoted from declares,

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:07.200
our life depends on whether we have love for the truth.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.200
So love Jehovah, love our neighbor.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.200
And yes, we must love the truth.
