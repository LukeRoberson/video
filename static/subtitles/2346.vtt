00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:15.250
Why is it so important to help our listeners grasp the meaning of our message?

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.410
The Apostle Paul reasoned on the matter at 1 Corinthians 149.

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:25.730
Unless you with the tongue you speech that is easily understood.

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:28.929
How will anyone know what is being said?

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:32.770
You will in fact be speaking into the air.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.049
In other words, we'd be wasting our time.

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:42.170
How then can we make our speech understandable to others?

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.689
We must understand our topic well.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.130
Use simple expressions and explain unfamiliar terms.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.649
In the following scenario, identify the expressions that are common to us, as Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.009
but that are not common to people in general.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.129
I'd like to give you this invitation to our regional convention.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.370
It's a wonderful event organized each year by the faithful and discreet slave.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.170
It's like our circuit assemblies, but larger.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.930
We enjoy it so much. You can really sense God's spirit there.

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:21.650
It really helps us to serve Jehovah and to get the best theocratic teaching there is.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.170
Um, maybe not. It doesn't sound like it's for me.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.730
Oh, okay. Maybe next time.

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:33.569
Will the householder readily understand the expression's regional convention?

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:43.250
Faithful and discreet slave, circuit assembly, God's spirit, or even Jehovah and theocratic teaching?

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:47.489
Not likely. Let's give the brother another chance.

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.450
I'd like to give you this invitation to a special event being held next month.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.170
This year, it's going to be at the event center.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.250
Everyone the community is invited, and it's free of charge.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.090
The program moves quickly with talks, interviews, and short films.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.890
This year, there's a movie that recounts the story of this time.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.889
The publisher kept it simple and peaked the householder's curiosity.

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:16.449
What about when we fulfill a speaking assignment in the congregation?

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.810
We need to think in advance about our audience.

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:23.969
If we have a conversation assignment on the midweek meeting,

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.289
we should use expressions that a householder will be familiar with.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.490
If we're giving a public talk, it shouldn't sound like a local needs part.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.729
In the following example, identify which kind of talk is being given,

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.330
a public talk, or a local needs part.

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.770
And this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:53.169
for a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.370
Friends, what does that verse mean to you personally?

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.169
Each of us should ask himself,

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:05.330
am I having a full share in this never-to-be-repeated work?

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:11.650
Can I arrange my circumstances to serve as an auxiliary pioneer or a regular pioneer?

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:14.849
Do I preach with a sense of urgency?

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.689
Am I doing my best to make return visits and conduct Bible studies?

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.610
Did you identify it as a local needs part?

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:26.770
What were some clues?

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.689
The speaker used expressions that aren't always familiar to non-witnesses.

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:40.050
Friends, auxiliary pioneer, regular pioneer, and return visits.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:48.530
Now, how might you apply Matthew 24-14 to an audience that includes non-witnesses?

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:50.129
Let's watch.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.650
And this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.969
for a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.370
Speaking about God's kingdom is one way that we can do good to others.

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:09.969
Even if we've just begun to learn the truth from the Bible,

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.050
we can share what we've learned with relatives or workmates.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.649
In this way, we may even help them to gain ever-lasting life.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:27.730
Be assured that Jehovah God will bless and reward the goodness you show to others.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.930
By helping our listeners to grasp the meaning of our message,

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:39.970
we'll be a joy to listen to, and our audience will clearly understand what they need to do.
