00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:08.820
The Teaching Committee has given me the privilege just to share a few thoughts with you regarding my recent visit to Belgium.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:16.820
So, unbeknownst to me, I was traveling from Seoul, Korea to Brussels, Belgium for the memorial.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.820
The day, the terrorist attacks were to take place, if you can imagine.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.820
So, we were to land in Munich and then change planes to go on to Brussels.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.820
And so, because of having internet on the plane from Seoul to Munich, I was able to learn right away about the terrorist attacks,

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.820
to learn that the airport in Brussels was closed.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:43.820
And so, I was able to make contact both with the Branch Committee in Belgium and also with the Branch Committee in Central Europe.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:53.820
And the brothers are very lovingly and kindly were able to arrange to have a brother in Munich drive me from Munich to the branch in Salters,

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:03.820
where I was able to overnight and then the next morning the brothers drove me on to Belgium so that we could continue with the memorial.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:12.819
Now, usually when there's been a terrorist attack like this, there are curfews placed, there are restrictions placed on traveling and public assembly.

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:19.819
And so, we wondered if it would be possible to even hold the memorial under the arrangements that had been previously made.

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:24.819
But thanks to Jehovah, the officials put no restrictions whatsoever.

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:35.819
And so, we were able to have the memorial as scheduled at the assembly hall with 1555 being present, which was a tremendous gift from Jehovah.

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:45.819
And just at the time when, of course, the brothers were kind of agitated because of what was taking place, it was such a privilege to be with them to be able to provide some comfort.

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:53.819
And then, just a few days later on Saturday, we were able to dedicate the brand new Kingdom Hall Complex in Antwerp.

00:01:53.819 --> 00:02:01.819
This is a five auditorium Kingdom Hall Complex. It's quite a sight. There's a picture of it on our next study edition Watch Tower.

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:04.819
You can see the brothers working on that Kingdom Hall Complex.

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:14.819
Well, all the brothers in Belgium, despite the challenges, were very, very eager to send their love and greetings to all of you, and I want to convey that to you now.

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.819
Thank you very much.
