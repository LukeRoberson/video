00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:12.519
Some time ago, I could spend entire days talking about Jehovah in the ministry.

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:18.519
That's why I was so sad when I got sick because I was used to being out in the preaching work.

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:27.670
I feel like I don't have the strength to do as much as I used to.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.670
But Jehovah is so great.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.670
He puts into the hearts of his people the desire to visit me and help me.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.670
They've cleaned my house.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.670
They even washed my clothes and prepared my meals.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.670
It makes me happy to see them arrive and I tell them,

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.670
it's so good to see you.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.670
Here you go.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.670
Have some coffee.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.670
They bring me tortillas and fruit.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.670
And they say to me, take them there for you.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.670
They prepared food, brought it over, and then we ate it together.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.670
I love that.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.670
I felt so protected as if I were surrounded by my children.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.670
The sisters really helped me.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.670
A couple of days before our meeting, they write out my comments in big letters.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.670
Then I can practice them over and over again.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.670
That way, I can give a comment at the meeting.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.670
But then I am sad when the brothers leave.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.670
I wish they could always be by my side.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.670
Then I remember Jehovah is always with me.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.670
Sometime ago, I was in better health.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.670
I could still go out in service.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.239
But the brothers and sisters have come to my aid.

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:49.519
I've been able to go out in public witnessing with the card.

00:01:49.519 --> 00:01:57.299
I continually see Jehovah's support and protection.

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.299
It really touches my heart.
