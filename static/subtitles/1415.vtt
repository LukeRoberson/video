Hello, I am Akihiro, and this is Iron Sharpen's Iron.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.890
Have you ever been in the ministry and just as you're starting a conversation, the individual

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.210
stops you and says, I'm not religious?

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.530
How did you react?

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.250
Did you freeze up?

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.609
I'm sure of what to say?

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:35.409
I know it's happened to me.

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:42.289
In this episode of Iron Sharpen's Iron, we're going to discuss three tips to help us reach

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:46.530
the hearts of non-religious people.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.530
But what comes to your mind when you hear the word non-religious?

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.969
You might assume this means the person doesn't believe in God, but the truth is that although

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.489
the person may not belong to an organized religion, they might very well have a belief

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.810
in God or in a higher power.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.329
So we don't want to make assumptions.

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:18.769
Less than nine of our brochures, love people make disciples says, empathy moves us to

00:01:18.769 --> 00:01:23.209
care about people, not just about our message.

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:29.049
So let's focus on letting the person express themselves and then empathizing with their

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.060
situation.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.939
Let's talk about three tips we can use to do that with non-religious people.

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.299
One, be positive.

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.980
Two, listen with understanding.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.500
And three, share information that addresses their needs.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.260
Now let's see how we can apply these tips.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.099
You know, with so many crazy things happening in the world right now, a lot of people feel

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:05.260
like world pieces and impossible dream.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.259
What's your opinion?

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.300
If this is about religion, I'm not interested.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.659
Everyone is free to believe what he wants.

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:24.620
What is important is not a bunch of rules and rituals.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.620
But believing in God from our hearts, that's my opinion.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.580
I agree.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.740
Believing in God from our heart is very important.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:44.699
If you don't mind, may I ask you why you're not interested in religion?

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:48.099
I used to belong to a religion.

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:53.659
In the hypocrisy, I saw it just completely turned me off.

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:54.659
Hmm.

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:59.180
I'm so sorry you experienced that.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.939
I can understand why you feel the way you do.

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:11.780
If religion cannot be of much help, what do you turn to for reliable guidance during

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.000
these tough times?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:27.379
Well, did you see how well our sisters put our first two tips into practice?

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.259
Our sisters maintained a positive spirit.

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:36.699
Even after the householder told them, he wasn't interested in religion.

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:41.500
This gave the householder the opportunity to speak and allowed our sisters to apply

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.259
our second tip, listen with understanding.

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:49.620
They listened as the man expressed himself.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.900
That allowed them to understand where he was coming from and then to respond empathetically

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.300
and keep the conversation going.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:04.659
But what if you meet someone who doesn't believe in God at all?

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:05.659
Let's take a look.

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:11.659
Hmm, it's a beautiful season isn't it?

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:15.699
I love the lavender so beautiful.

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:18.860
Oh, yeah, I love it too.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.259
The color is lovely isn't it?

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:23.980
Hmm, it is.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:32.819
Oh, you know, to me, flowers are like an amazing gift from God.

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:36.620
Have you ever wondered if there is a God?

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.939
Hmm.

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:40.220
A God?

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:47.939
Well, it would be nice if there were, but I don't believe in God.

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:52.699
Hmm, you know, many feel the same way you do.

00:04:52.699 --> 00:05:00.420
If you don't mind me asking, have you ever wondered why some people do believe in God?

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.220
Hmm.

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:06.009
Honestly, I have.

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:13.439
But I haven't found a reasonable answer.

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:19.680
Once again, our sister maintained a positive spirit and wasn't put off by the woman stating

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.000
that she doesn't believe in God.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:31.040
Instead, she sought further understanding by asking a simple, yet genuine question.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.319
Have you ever wondered why some people do believe in God?

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:42.079
Did you see how the woman relaxed when she realized that the sister was actually interested

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:48.000
in understanding her and was willing to continue the conversation?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.839
Now, if the person is willing to talk and the opportunity arises, we can apply our third

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:59.920
tip, share information that addresses their needs.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.800
With our last householder, what do we have in our library of publications that we could

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.319
share with her?

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:14.319
We could share one of the brochures in our teaching toolbox that addresses creation.

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:22.800
Or if they are available in your language, a video from a series was it designed?

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.040
Or viewpoints on the origin of life?

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:35.839
So, let's make it our goal to be more familiar with all the tools Jehovah has given us.

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:41.920
Every year, there are non-religious people who become Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:50.939
So, we have reason to be positive when we speak to those not interested in religion.

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:58.980
And as we listen with understanding, and when appropriate, share information that addresses

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.100
their needs.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:08.620
We will be doing our best to reach the hearts of non-religious people.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:13.680
These tips have helped me in my ministry.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.160
And as iron sharpens iron, I hope they help you too.
