00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:05.330
And that is also the theme for this month's program.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.330
Keep conquering the evil with the good.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.329
This challenging exhortation was written by the Apostle Paul at Romans 12-21.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:22.329
It's challenging because we live in a world that is alienated from God and the truth,

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:27.329
a world that tries to squeeze everyone into its mold.

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:34.329
Isaiah 5-20 shows how the world has changed God-given standards.

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:36.329
It reads,

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.329
Wall to those who say that good is bad and bad is good.

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.329
Those who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness.

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.329
Those who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter.

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.329
By adhering to the standard of healthful words in the Scriptures

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.329
and to the examples of faithful servants of the past,

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.329
we can conquer the evil with the good.

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:12.329
The faithful man, Inak, was born when Adam was about 600 years old,

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:18.329
which means that Inak and Adam were contemporaries for about 300 years.

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:25.329
However, there is no record of any contact between them during that period of time.

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:33.329
The Scriptures indicate that violence and hate for God were widespread in that pre-flood world.

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.329
Many centuries later, the disciple Jude describes the fear-inspiring prophecy

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.329
that God gave to Inak about Jehovah coming with his holy myriads,

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:51.329
legions of mighty angels in battle array to bring destruction to all the ungodly.

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.329
Inak fearlessly went about declaring the coming judgment and destruction

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.329
and what is more, he did it alone.

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.329
The prophecy was fulfilled in the global deluge,

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:12.330
and it set the pattern of a greater destruction yet to come.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:20.330
No wonder that Genesis 524 tells us that Inak kept walking with the true God.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.330
Inak's example gives us courage to remain firm for true worship,

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.330
even if family and friends stand apart from us.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.330
Inak did not try to fit in with the evil crowd of the pre-flood world,

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.330
and we don't want to fit in with the present dying world and its evil ways.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:49.330
We may feel alone at times, but we are reminded that Jehovah never abandoned Inak,

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.330
and neither will he abandon his faithful servants today.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:03.330
We imitate Inak by not allowing the evil surrounding us to undermine our faith in Jehovah.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:11.330
Like Inak, we can conquer the evil with the good by avoiding bad associations,

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.330
sticking close to Jehovah God on the earthly part of his organization,

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.330
and boldly proclaiming the good news.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:26.960
Elisha the Prophet refused to engage in paying evil for evil,

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.960
even when it seemed justified.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:36.960
The account is found at 2nd Kings, chapter 6, verses 14 to 23.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.960
Syria was at war with Israel.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.960
The King of Syria was enraged because Elisha was able to foresee wherever it was

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.960
that Syria was planning to ambush the Israelites.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.960
Elisha would warn the King of Israel,

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.960
and he in turn would keep his troops away from the place of ambush.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:06.960
The King of Syria became exasperated and wanted desperately to take the Prophet Elisha captive,

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.960
to stop him from warning the King of Israel.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:17.959
It came about that the King of Syria learned that Elisha was in the city of Dothan.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:24.959
So the King sent horses, war chariots, as well as a large army to surround Dothan by night

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:27.959
in order to take Elisha captive.

00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:35.959
The following morning, Jehovah listened to Elisha and did something amazing.

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:40.959
He struck the Syrian troops with the temporary form of blindness,

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:45.959
and Elisha guided all those troops, not back to Syria,

00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:49.959
but to Samaria where the King of Israel resided.

00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:55.959
The King of Israel was anxious to strike down and kill the Syrian troops,

00:04:55.959 --> 00:05:04.959
but Elisha said to him, as recorded in verses 22 and 23 of Second Kings, chapter 6.

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:07.959
You must not strike them down.

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:13.959
Do you strike down those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow?

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:19.959
Give them bread and water so they may eat and drink and return to their Lord.

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:24.959
So he spread a great feast for them, and they ate and drank,

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:28.959
after which he sent them away to return to their Lord.

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:36.959
What a shock this must have been to the Syrian soldiers who likely thought that they were as good as dead.

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:42.959
This astounding turn of events was far better than paying evil for evil.

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:45.959
How do we know it was better?

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:49.959
The latter part of verse 23 says,

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:56.959
and not once did the marauder bands of the Syrians come again into the land of Israel.

00:05:56.959 --> 00:06:02.959
Can you imagine the men of the Syrian army relating to their King what had taken place?

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:06.959
They went out to take Elisha captive.

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:13.959
However, Elisha, with the help of Jehovah Spirit, had taken the Syrians captive without a battle.

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:18.959
The Syrian King must have been dumbfounded when he heard the report,

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:23.959
and you can be sure that the soldiers of the Syrian army were not only grateful,

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:30.959
but they acquired a very respectful fear of Jehovah and of his prophet Elisha.

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:36.959
The good done to the Syrians would not be soon forgotten.

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:41.959
Like Elisha, we want to do what is good for people,

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:45.959
including those who do not view us favorably.

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:50.959
When tragedies such as fires, floods, earthquakes, and hurricanes strike,

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:55.959
we go out of our way to comfort people with the Scriptures.

00:06:55.959 --> 00:07:01.959
Also, Jehovah's Witnesses serving as relief workers are well known for the practical assistance

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:05.959
they render to fellow believers and to others.

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:10.959
As a result, many people have changed their view of us

00:07:10.959 --> 00:07:14.959
and have come to appreciate that in these last days,

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:18.959
Jehovah does indeed have a people for his name on the earth.

00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:25.240
At 2 Timothy 2 verses 23 through 25,

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:32.240
the Apostle Paul encourages us to display qualities that make us different from the world.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:38.240
He says, further, reject foolish and ignorant debates,

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.240
knowing that they produce fights.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:45.240
For a slave of the Lord does not need to fight,

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:50.240
but needs to be gentle toward all, qualified to teach,

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:55.240
showing restraint when wronged, instructing with mildness,

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.240
those not favorably disposed.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.240
And then Paul explains the desired result.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:08.240
Perhaps God may give them repentance leading to an accurate knowledge of truth.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:13.240
Paul was gentle toward all and qualified to teach.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:20.240
He showed restraint when he was imprisoned by the Roman authorities around 60 or 61 CE.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.240
He spent about two years under house arrest in Rome,

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.240
perhaps even being chained to a guard.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:31.240
He had done nothing to merit imprisonment.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.240
However, he did not dwell on the evil done to him,

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:42.240
and he did not allow it to make him bitter and resentful of Roman authorities.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:50.240
Rather, in Philippians chapter 1 verses 12 through 14, Paul wrote,

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:58.240
Now I want you to know, brothers, that my situation has actually turned out for the advancement of the good news,

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:06.240
so that my prison bonds for the sake of Christ have become public knowledge among all the Praetorian guard and all the rest.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:12.240
Now, most of the brothers in the Lord have gained confidence because of my prison bonds,

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.240
and they are showing all the more courage to speak the word of God fearlessly.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.240
In his letter to Titus at chapter 3 verses 1 and 2,

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:29.240
Paul gives reminders on how Christians today can conquer the evil with the good

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:35.240
by showing proper respect for governmental authorities wherever we may live.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.240
He writes,

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:43.240
Continue reminding them, fellow Christians, to be in subjection,

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:47.240
and to be obedient to governments and authorities,

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.240
to be ready for every good work,

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.240
to speak injuriously of no one,

00:09:54.240 --> 00:10:02.240
not to be quarrelsome, but to be reasonable, displaying all mildness toward all men.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:06.240
Paul followed his own advice.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.240
While in custody and Rome,

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:14.240
Paul wrote inspired letters to Christian congregations in Greece and Asia Minor,

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.240
and we today benefit from the council in those letters.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:24.240
Never do we read in his letters criticism aimed at human rulers

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:30.240
or encouragement for Christians to favor one political figure or party over another.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.240
He was no part of the world,

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:39.240
and he knew that man's only hope was the kingdom of God.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:43.240
Paul was a spiritual man,

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.240
and he conquered the evil with the good

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.240
by following Jesus' instructions at Mark 12-17,

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.240
of giving Caesar's things to Caesar,

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.240
but God's things to God,

00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:01.240
all the while displaying a mildness that belongs to wisdom.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:06.549
At first Peter, 221,

00:11:06.549 --> 00:11:11.549
we receive further direction about the course that we are to follow.

00:11:11.549 --> 00:11:13.549
Peter writes,

00:11:13.549 --> 00:11:17.549
in fact, to this course you were called,

00:11:17.549 --> 00:11:20.549
because even Christ suffered for you,

00:11:20.549 --> 00:11:24.549
leaving a model for you to follow his steps closely.

00:11:24.549 --> 00:11:29.549
Some of Christ's steps are enumerated in verses 22 and 23,

00:11:29.549 --> 00:11:31.549
where it reads,

00:11:31.549 --> 00:11:35.549
he, Jesus, committed no sin,

00:11:35.549 --> 00:11:38.549
nor was deception found in his mouth.

00:11:38.549 --> 00:11:40.549
When he was being insulted,

00:11:40.549 --> 00:11:43.549
he did not insult and return.

00:11:43.549 --> 00:11:45.549
When he was suffering,

00:11:45.549 --> 00:11:47.549
he did not threaten,

00:11:47.549 --> 00:11:52.549
but he entrusted himself to the one who judges righteously.

00:11:52.549 --> 00:11:57.549
Jehovah is the one who judges righteously.

00:11:57.549 --> 00:12:02.549
However, the Jewish religious leaders did not judge the Christ righteously.

00:12:02.549 --> 00:12:05.549
They insulted Jesus frequently

00:12:05.549 --> 00:12:09.549
and even accused him of having a demon.

00:12:09.549 --> 00:12:13.549
Jesus did not stoop to return evil for evil,

00:12:13.549 --> 00:12:17.549
hurling insults or threatening people.

00:12:17.549 --> 00:12:24.549
Insults and threats do not open hearts to accept the good news.

00:12:25.549 --> 00:12:27.549
When Jesus was on trial,

00:12:27.549 --> 00:12:33.549
the Jewish religious leaders spurred the crowd on to cry out for his execution.

00:12:33.549 --> 00:12:36.549
The Roman authorities had Jesus nailed to a torture stake

00:12:36.549 --> 00:12:40.549
to suffer a cruel and excruciating death.

00:12:40.549 --> 00:12:43.549
While suffering on the torture stake,

00:12:43.549 --> 00:12:46.549
what did Jesus speak about?

00:12:46.549 --> 00:12:49.549
Did he curse the Roman soldiers who had mistreated him

00:12:49.549 --> 00:12:52.549
and were now executing him?

00:12:52.549 --> 00:12:57.549
Through the contrary, he conquered the evil with the good.

00:12:57.549 --> 00:13:03.549
Among Jesus' last words are those recorded at Luke 2334.

00:13:03.549 --> 00:13:06.549
Father, forgive them,

00:13:06.549 --> 00:13:10.549
for they do not know what they are doing.

00:13:10.549 --> 00:13:15.549
Jesus knew that the Roman soldiers were ignorant of who he really was

00:13:15.549 --> 00:13:18.549
and did not know what they were doing.

00:13:18.549 --> 00:13:20.549
He could forgive them with the hope

00:13:20.549 --> 00:13:23.549
that they would eventually respond to the truth

00:13:23.549 --> 00:13:26.549
and become his disciples.

00:13:26.549 --> 00:13:28.549
In every respect,

00:13:28.549 --> 00:13:31.549
Jesus conquered the evil with the good

00:13:31.549 --> 00:13:35.549
and he always displayed complete confidence

00:13:35.549 --> 00:13:40.549
in the one who judges righteously, Jehovah God.

00:13:40.549 --> 00:13:45.549
We want to demonstrate the same kind of confidence in Jehovah

00:13:45.549 --> 00:13:49.549
and in His Word that Jesus displayed.

00:13:49.549 --> 00:13:52.549
We do our best to imitate the Christ

00:13:52.549 --> 00:14:00.549
by applying the Spirit-inspired counsel at Romans 12 verses 17 and 18.

00:14:00.549 --> 00:14:04.549
Return evil for evil to no one.

00:14:04.549 --> 00:14:07.549
Take into consideration what is fine

00:14:07.549 --> 00:14:10.549
from the viewpoint of all men.

00:14:10.549 --> 00:14:13.549
If possible, as far as it depends on you,

00:14:13.549 --> 00:14:16.549
be peaceable with all men.

00:14:16.549 --> 00:14:20.549
Heating this counsel is particularly important in homes

00:14:20.549 --> 00:14:23.549
that are religiously divided.

00:14:23.549 --> 00:14:26.549
The Christian maid resists the temptation

00:14:26.549 --> 00:14:31.549
to repay an unkind word or act with another unkindness.

00:14:31.549 --> 00:14:36.549
Really, no good comes from returning evil for evil.

00:14:36.549 --> 00:14:42.549
On the contrary, such an attitude can only aggravate the situation.

00:14:42.549 --> 00:14:44.549
In the domestic setting,

00:14:44.549 --> 00:14:48.549
a wife who shows genuine kindness to her husband

00:14:48.549 --> 00:14:52.549
after he makes unpleasant comments about her beliefs

00:14:52.549 --> 00:14:57.549
may well diffuse a potentially explosive situation.

00:14:57.549 --> 00:15:00.549
At Proverbs 31-12, we are told

00:15:00.549 --> 00:15:05.549
how a capable God-fearing wife deals with her husband.

00:15:05.549 --> 00:15:08.549
She rewards him with good,

00:15:08.549 --> 00:15:12.549
not bad, all the days of her life.

00:15:12.549 --> 00:15:15.549
Additionally, by taking into consideration

00:15:15.549 --> 00:15:18.549
what is fine from the viewpoint of all men,

00:15:18.549 --> 00:15:21.549
Jehovah's people have often overcome prejudice

00:15:21.549 --> 00:15:24.549
by providing practical assistance to their neighbors

00:15:24.549 --> 00:15:26.549
as opportunity affords,

00:15:26.549 --> 00:15:30.549
and particularly when a disaster strikes.

00:15:30.549 --> 00:15:35.549
We conscientiously adhere to Romans 12-19,

00:15:35.549 --> 00:15:37.549
which states,

00:15:37.549 --> 00:15:40.549
do not avenge yourselves beloved,

00:15:40.549 --> 00:15:44.549
but yield place to the wrath for it is written.

00:15:44.549 --> 00:15:47.549
Vengeance is mine.

00:15:47.549 --> 00:15:50.549
I will repay, says Jehovah.

00:15:50.549 --> 00:15:53.549
The footnote on verse 19 shows

00:15:53.549 --> 00:15:58.549
that Paul is telling us to yield to God's wrath or anger.

00:15:58.549 --> 00:16:02.549
Jehovah is the one who will set matters straight,

00:16:02.549 --> 00:16:06.549
and he will do it much better than we ever could.

00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:09.549
As James 1-20 states,

00:16:09.549 --> 00:16:15.549
man's anger does not bring about God's righteousness.

00:16:15.549 --> 00:16:18.549
The theme of this discussion is summarized

00:16:18.549 --> 00:16:22.549
exquisitely at Romans 12-20 and 21,

00:16:22.549 --> 00:16:27.549
with this direction to all of Jehovah's people.

00:16:27.549 --> 00:16:31.549
But if your enemy is hungry, feed him.

00:16:31.549 --> 00:16:34.549
If he is thirsty,

00:16:34.549 --> 00:16:36.549
give him something to drink.

00:16:36.549 --> 00:16:38.549
For by doing this,

00:16:38.549 --> 00:16:41.549
you will heap fiery coals on his head.

00:16:41.549 --> 00:16:46.549
Do not let yourself be conquered by the evil,

00:16:46.549 --> 00:16:50.549
but keep conquering the evil with the good.
