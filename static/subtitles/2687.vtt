WEBVTT

00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:07.419
We warmly welcome all of you to JW Broadcasting.

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:13.419
This month's theme is imitate Jehovah's generosity.

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:18.420
Our program will bring us closer to our great God, Jehovah.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.420
Here's a sample.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.420
What will you do in paradise?

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.420
Some of our young ones share what they look forward to in the New World

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.420
and how their hope draws them to Jehovah.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:39.420
The Book of Hosea can teach us profound truths if we know how to find them.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:47.420
We'll explore Hosea together and learn how to dig for our own treasures.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:59.420
You Christian sisters are beautiful examples of compassion, self-sacrifice, humility, and so much more.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.420
But at times some of you may feel that others don't notice what you do.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:15.420
This month's music video will assure you that your brothers and sisters love and appreciate you very much.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.420
There's much to look forward to in this edition of JW Broadcasting.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:46.730
Humans are born with a strong inclination to imitate.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.730
In fact, very young infants have been observed imitating facial expressions.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.730
That's amazing.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:01.730
Makes me think of an experience I had some 40 years ago when Susan and I were in the circuit work.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:12.729
A sister told me that her little five-year-old son was looking in a mirror and making various expressions with his face and eyes.

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:15.729
His mother asked, what are you doing?

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:20.729
He said, I can't do like brother let.

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:23.729
I'll never be a circuit overseer.

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:32.979
Well, I'm sure he soon learned that voluminous facial expressions are not a requirement for circuit work.

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:36.979
In fact, they could be a disadvantage.

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:42.979
By the way, thank you for putting up with me all these years.

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:48.979
But how does a small child learn to walk, feed himself and talk?

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:52.979
He learns by imitating his parents and others.

00:02:52.979 --> 00:03:00.979
However, there's one type of imitating that does not come automatically or even easily.

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:04.979
It's identified at Ephesians 5.1.

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:12.979
It says, therefore, become imitators of God as beloved children.

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:14.979
Notice the word become.

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:18.979
We are not born as imitators of God.

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:26.979
Because of inherited imperfection, we aren't even born with an inclination to become an imitator of God.

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:35.979
Genesis 8.21 says, for the inclination of the heart of man is bad from his youth up.

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:41.979
Therefore, it takes earnest effort to become an imitator of God.

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:46.979
But it's well worth the effort and Jehovah will help us.

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:53.979
What blessings will we personally read if we become an imitator of God?

00:03:53.979 --> 00:04:02.979
The greatest blessing, Jehovah will see that we are trying to be like Him and He will love us and draw close to us.

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:13.979
Also, the more we learn about Jehovah and strive to be like Him, the more we'll love Him and the closer we'll draw to Him.

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:19.980
Cultivating Godly qualities will result in improved relations with others.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.980
Imitating Godly qualities will make us a better person overall.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.980
The more we like Jehovah, the happier we'll be.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.980
That's how He created us.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:41.980
Those are just a few of the blessings we'll reap if we become an imitator of God.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:50.980
In our publications, more than 40 different qualities of Jehovah have been identified and discussed.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.980
But in this discussion, let's examine just one.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:01.980
We'll discuss the theme, imitate Jehovah's generosity.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.980
Generosity is an aspect of Jehovah's love.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:13.980
Unquestionably, Jehovah God is the most generous giver in the universe.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.980
Let's talk about this.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.980
Eons and eons ago, Jehovah God was all alone.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:30.980
And even though it's impossible for us to comprehend, He wasn't lonely or lacking anything, but because of love.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:36.980
He generously chose to share the gift of life with others.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.980
He decided to become a father, a creator.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:48.980
Logically, He began by creating a son with whom He could directly enjoy fellowship.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:54.980
As we know, this son became known as the Word, as Jehovah's spokesman.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:03.980
But then, at some point in time, again, not because of loneliness or lacking anything, but because of love.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:15.980
He chose to further expand his family by creating millions of angelic sons who could also directly associate with him.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:25.980
Then amazingly, further down the stream of time, because of love, He again chose to expand his family.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:33.980
These children were a lower form of life, but ones who were made in His image, and whom He loved deeply.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.980
Of course, we're talking about Adam and Eve.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.980
The original parents of all of us.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:46.980
If Jehovah had not created them, none of us would ever have been born.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:54.980
Yes, life itself is a wonderful, miraculous, and generous gift.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:01.980
Without this gift, we wouldn't be able to enjoy any of Jehovah's other marvelous blessings.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:08.980
Let's now talk about Jehovah's generosity when it comes to physical gifts.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:15.980
Every good gift and every perfect present is from above.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.980
Think for a moment about the planet we live on.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:25.980
Jehovah created the earth as a beautiful and unique home for us.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:37.980
It has all the right conditions to sustain life, including the oxygen and water cycles that continually recycle essential resources.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:47.980
If the earth were closer to the sun, all the water would boil off, and the planet would be a barren rock.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:58.980
Conversely, if it were farther from the sun, the water would freeze, and the planet would be like an uninhabitable iceberg.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:08.980
Jehovah placed the earth at the perfect location, often called the Goldilocks Zone.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:13.980
Think too about the marvelous gift of our human bodies.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:22.980
Even in our imperfect state, as mentioned at Psalm 139.14, we are wonderfully made.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:30.980
Isn't it brilliant how our skin is designed to heal when we cut, scrape, or bruise it?

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.980
When we scratch, scrape, or dent our car.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.980
Does it heal itself?

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:45.980
Can you imagine what we would look like if every time we damage our skin, it just stayed that way?

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:50.980
We'd begin to look pretty rough in just a short period of time.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:59.980
And isn't it amazing how the skin allows water to exit the body in the form of perspiration?

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:06.980
But at the same time, it doesn't allow water to enter the body when we take a bath.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.980
Otherwise, we'd become waterlogged.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:19.980
Ponder for a moment about how food is not only nutritious, but it's also delicious.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:24.980
This makes fueling our bodies very enjoyable.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:35.980
Jehovah could have made eating like putting gasoline in a car on necessary function, but void of enjoyment.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:41.980
Think of all the tasty varieties of food as just one example.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:45.980
How many varieties of grapes are there?

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:54.980
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, there are about 10,000 different great varieties worldwide.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:10:01.980
Jehovah could have given us just two varieties, red and green.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.980
But why do we have some 10,000 varieties?

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:10.980
Because of Jehovah's voluminous generosity.

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:19.980
But now we ask, how can we imitate Jehovah's generosity in giving physical gifts?

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:29.980
It's obvious that Jehovah's put a lot of thought into his gift giving so that his gifts are practical and beneficial.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:35.980
Likewise, we should prayerfully meditate so that our gifts are useful.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:40.980
Not all gifts are practical. One brother gave this example.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:46.980
A puppy might make a fine gift to a young one living in a rural setting.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.980
But it's a terrible gift to a Bethelite.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:11:03.419
If our brother lacks food, clothing or shelter, we don't just say, go in peace, keep warm and well fed.

00:11:03.419 --> 00:11:17.419
No, we apply Proverbs 3.27, which says, do not withhold good from those to whom you should give it if it is within your power to help.

00:11:17.419 --> 00:11:28.419
In addition to helping brothers in need directly, we can indirectly help them by making donations to the worldwide work.

00:11:29.419 --> 00:11:50.419
The governing body prayerfully strives to use wisely these precious dedicated funds to help our dear brothers who have been afflicted by natural or man-made disasters and who urgently need suitable kingdom halls and assistance in many other ways.

00:11:50.419 --> 00:11:58.419
Speaking of the need for kingdom halls as just one example, please look at these pictures from the Philippines.

00:11:58.419 --> 00:12:04.419
Here are six before and after photographs.

00:12:04.419 --> 00:12:14.419
And what do you think was the individual average cost of these six new simplified but dignified kingdom halls?

00:12:14.419 --> 00:12:18.419
$21,000 US dollars.

00:12:19.419 --> 00:12:21.419
Please think about this.

00:12:21.419 --> 00:12:28.419
Jehovah's physical gifts such as the rain, sunshine and oxygen are recurring.

00:12:28.419 --> 00:12:33.419
What's one way to imitate this aspect of Jehovah's giving?

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:46.419
Well, 1 Corinthians 162 says, on the first day of every week each of you should set something aside according to his own means.

00:12:46.419 --> 00:12:59.419
In harmony with the scriptural principle many have chosen to set something aside each month by scheduling recurring online donations.

00:12:59.419 --> 00:13:06.419
But now let's briefly contemplate Jehovah's spiritual gifts which are even more impressive.

00:13:07.419 --> 00:13:09.419
Think about the Bible.

00:13:09.419 --> 00:13:12.419
Where would we be without it?

00:13:12.419 --> 00:13:16.419
Lost, hopeless, floundering.

00:13:16.419 --> 00:13:21.419
We'd have to learn by experience, the school of hard knocks.

00:13:21.419 --> 00:13:25.419
We'd need at least two lives to live.

00:13:25.419 --> 00:13:31.419
One to practice and the second to perform.

00:13:31.419 --> 00:13:34.419
Next, think about the Holy Spirit.

00:13:34.419 --> 00:13:41.419
John 1426 describes it as a helper, teacher and a remembranceer.

00:13:41.419 --> 00:13:48.419
It is the most powerful force in the universe and Jehovah gives it to us generously.

00:13:48.419 --> 00:13:52.419
Consider for a moment the resurrection hope.

00:13:52.419 --> 00:13:59.419
It strengthens us in time of great distress when death takes a loved one.

00:13:59.419 --> 00:14:02.419
Or when we face death ourselves.

00:14:02.419 --> 00:14:06.419
I'm reminded of the six-year-old girl who said,

00:14:06.419 --> 00:14:10.419
thank you, Jehovah, for the resurrection hope.

00:14:10.419 --> 00:14:14.419
It is a very good idea.

00:14:14.419 --> 00:14:21.419
For a final example, what was Jehovah's greatest spiritual gift of generosity?

00:14:21.419 --> 00:14:27.419
The gift of his son to purchase us from sin and death.

00:14:27.419 --> 00:14:31.419
And it wasn't just any angel whom Jehovah sent.

00:14:31.419 --> 00:14:36.419
It was his firstborn, his only begotten son.

00:14:36.419 --> 00:14:44.419
What if you were tied to a chair and forced to watch the torture and execution of your most beloved child?

00:14:44.419 --> 00:14:47.419
That would be horrible.

00:14:47.419 --> 00:14:53.419
Of course, Jehovah was not tied, but because of his great love for us.

00:14:53.419 --> 00:15:01.419
He restrained himself and allowed the torture and execution of his most precious son.

00:15:01.419 --> 00:15:07.419
That is the ultimate example of generosity.

00:15:07.419 --> 00:15:15.419
But now we ask, how can we imitate Jehovah's generosity in giving spiritual gifts?

00:15:15.419 --> 00:15:20.419
One way, by being generous and giving sincere commendation.

00:15:20.419 --> 00:15:25.419
If you see something good, say something good.

00:15:25.419 --> 00:15:28.419
Proverbs 15, 23 says,

00:15:28.419 --> 00:15:34.419
a word spoken at the right time how good it is.

00:15:34.419 --> 00:15:37.419
Words have great power.

00:15:37.419 --> 00:15:44.419
To illustrate, think of how two words from a convention chairman can lift thousands of pounds.

00:15:44.419 --> 00:15:46.419
What are they?

00:15:46.419 --> 00:15:49.419
Please stand.

00:15:49.419 --> 00:15:53.419
In this vein, Proverbs 1821 says,

00:15:53.419 --> 00:15:58.419
death and life are in the power of the tongue.

00:15:58.419 --> 00:16:04.419
Just a few words at the right time can make a tremendous difference in a person's life.

00:16:04.419 --> 00:16:12.419
They can cause a depressed one to stand with a positive hope for the future.

00:16:12.419 --> 00:16:16.419
Another way, freely give out forgiveness.

00:16:16.419 --> 00:16:27.419
Colossians 313 reminds us that Jehovah freely forgives us and that we must also do the same.

00:16:27.419 --> 00:16:34.419
The word freely in English means generously and can also mean without charge.

00:16:34.419 --> 00:16:41.419
Is there someone you can extend true forgiveness to in imitation of our generous God?

00:16:41.419 --> 00:16:47.419
Additionally, how about generously giving out knowledge?

00:16:47.419 --> 00:16:56.419
Do we pray for a Bible study and then work in harmony with those prayers by searching diligently for a deserving one?

00:16:56.419 --> 00:17:06.420
Do we liberally train others and share the skills we have in the ministry and in the maintenance and construction of theocratic facilities?

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:14.420
People in general often hoard the knowledge they have in order to protect their job.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:22.420
But like Jehovah, we gladly share the knowledge we have with others.

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:32.420
During our discussion, we barely scratch the surface regarding Jehovah's generosity and how we can imitate Him.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:40.420
We will learn forever about our great God and how we can better reflect His qualities.

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:55.420
But in the meantime, the more we learn about Him and the more closely we can imitate Him, the richer, happier and more satisfying our lives will be.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:18:02.720
And why? Because that's how He created us.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:09.720
Another way we imitate Jehovah's generosity is by showing hospitality.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.720
Do you sometimes hold back?

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:17.720
Our next segment offers practical suggestions that can help you.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:30.420
What mattered most to me was that everything was just right.

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:37.420
My apartment had to be spotless and the dining table had to be full with different types of food, completely full.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:45.420
I was worried that our apartment wasn't big enough to accommodate guests, not even for a meal.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:52.420
I was often wondering if we would have enough time for invitations or if it would be too stressful.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:58.420
Before my financial situation was much better, currently it's not good, but I manage.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:05.420
The brothers and sisters are such a precious gift from Jehovah. This is truly the family He gave us.

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:11.420
The brothers and sisters have shown us so much love, and I want to do all I can to express my gratitude.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:15.420
The best way to do so is just by spending time together.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.420
We're happy to take time for our brothers.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:24.420
So many of the friends live alone or just want someone to spend time with.

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:30.420
It's nice when we can show hospitality in our homes, but I've learned that hospitality starts in the Kingdom Hall.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:34.420
After all, Jehovah has invited all of us to be his guests.

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:39.420
I prefer to stand right by the entrance. This way I can notice any interested ones that come to the meetings.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:45.420
A warm smile shows personal interest, and lets them know I'm genuinely happy that they've come.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:51.420
Brothers and sisters in the congregation are my family. That is why I want to hug them.

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:56.420
Kiss them, ask them how they feel. They should feel happy just as I am.

00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:04.420
I am normally pretty tired after the meeting. I've had a long day and still have the rest of the week ahead of me.

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:09.420
But that is the case with the others too. Sometimes there are things they would like to share.

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:14.420
Taking the time to listen to them can really make their day.

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:17.420
I plan to invite four to five friends every other week.

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:24.420
To my great joy my plan came true within a year and a half. Everyone was invited, and everyone came.

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:29.420
Brothers usually ask me what to bring. I say, don't bring anything. Just your beautiful smile.

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:33.420
And bring someone who you know very well, but who I don't know.

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:40.420
There have been times after the meeting when we've said to each other, we just have to invite someone over.

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:46.420
Then we go around asking people sometimes four or more until we find someone who has time.

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:53.420
This has led to so many beautiful moments together. No one feels pressured or expects anything extravagant.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:57.420
Everyone is relaxed and it feels like a calm evening with family.

00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:04.500
One experience completely changed my view of hospitality.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:11.500
A friend of mine called me and said, hey, I'm close by. Do you have time? Can I come over?

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:16.500
I thought, what am I supposed to cook? At that moment, the doorbell ring.

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:23.500
My friend was already there. The only thing I could think of to cook was pasta with sauce.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:29.500
When we sat down to eat, my friend said to me, Stephanie, pasta is my favorite food.

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.500
That was a great moment.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:36.500
I live a simple life. To host brothers, I need to spend some money.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:42.500
However, there are leaflets with special offers. I checked them to see what's discounted.

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:47.880
The friends are happy, and I didn't spend a lot of money.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:52.880
We've had several brothers spend an ITM. They come for pioneer school, elder school,

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.880
and other theocratic projects.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:01.880
It's so encouraging to see their positive attitude when they come home in the evenings.

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:07.880
It's priceless. They're energized from the school and they have so many upbuilding thoughts.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.880
Their positivity is contagious.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:17.670
Our apartment isn't very big, so we wondered where our guests could sleep.

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:21.670
We decided to turn the office into a guest room.

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:29.670
We had to move the desk into our room, but now we have space for an air mattress for our guests to sleep on.

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:31.670
It's a great solution.

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:35.670
I take photos of my guests and stick them into my photo album.

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:40.670
We live in such times when it's normal to get said sometimes. It happens to me too.

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:44.670
My remedy for sadness is to take the photos, look at them.

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:50.670
Remember our get-togethers, remember our laughter, remember the atmosphere we had, the experiences I heard.

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:53.670
I meditate on them and that lives me up again.

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:58.670
When I see how happy my guests are, it makes me truly happy.

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:04.670
Spending time together not only strengthens our friendships with each other, but also with Jehovah as well.

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:07.670
We live in such insecure times.

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:11.670
We really don't know what life situations we will face next.

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:15.670
Not only are we affected by these situations, but others are also.

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:22.670
Making the best out of the time we have together helps to build friendships strong and meaningful friendships.

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:26.670
There are so many different personalities in the congregation.

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:31.670
And the time is coming when it will be essential for us to stick together.

00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:36.670
We will face more and more pressure in this system of things.

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:44.670
But we will be ever more thankful for the friendships and the congregation that can help us to resist this pressure.

00:23:45.670 --> 00:24:06.710
Together we are stronger because we can all support and rely on each other.

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:08.710
How timely!

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:12.710
That same Watchtower article made this point.

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:20.710
As pressures mount, we will need the deepest of love between us and our brothers and sisters.

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:28.710
Yes, by generously extending hospitality, we strengthen the bonds of love among us.

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:39.710
We need that close bond with our brothers and sisters, especially when we suffer a painful, unexpected tragedy.

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:45.710
Marcella, Maite and Jackie faced such a crisis.

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:54.710
As we hear their story, notice how their strong faith helped them and their family endure.

00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:59.710
I'm from Colombia. I have five more sisters.

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:03.710
I learned the truth from a very young age through my parents.

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:06.710
It was a very active spiritual life.

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:11.710
My dad lived the truth. He wasn't just in the truth. He lived the truth.

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:15.710
And he always tried to pass that on to us.

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:21.710
He made sure that we never went to school without reading the day's text first. That was essential.

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:27.710
We could be late for school, but we couldn't leave the house without reading the text.

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:34.710
We were a big family, but we were always at the meeting. We filled two rows.

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:40.710
He was always concerned about the well-being of the brothers. He was always available.

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:45.710
He was very hospitable. My mom as well.

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:50.710
So he used to invite his Bible students and the brothers to our house.

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:57.710
And I remember that he would close the kitchen door, put on some music, and cook a delicious meal.

00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:06.660
He liked to keep everything fun, and for us girls to have fun, especially when we were together as a family.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:13.579
He would give each one of us what we needed and enjoyed.

00:26:13.579 --> 00:26:19.579
He used to take us for walks on the weekend, after the meeting, and after preaching.

00:26:19.579 --> 00:26:23.579
It was a privilege to have a father like that.

00:26:23.579 --> 00:26:31.140
Well, that day, I remember that we were at home.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:35.900
He was going to put the car in the garage.

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:46.400
Someone came to the car and threatened him and my mom, with machine guns, to get him out of the car to kidnap him.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.400
We heard a noise.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.400
We all got scared and ran outside.

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:58.400
And then I remember that my dad was on the ground.

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.400
And some men had shot him.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:04.700
He was just left there.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:12.380
I just picked him up in my arms.

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:16.390
He was taken to the hospital.

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:19.390
And a few hours later, he died.

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:24.789
My dad's last words were,

00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:27.789
Jova, protect my daughters.

00:27:27.789 --> 00:27:32.789
Take care of my daughters and my little lady, them and my mom.

00:27:32.789 --> 00:27:41.619
My mom, she was strong.

00:27:41.619 --> 00:27:47.619
She gave us, she gave us a lot of strength, and she carried on with the spirit of routine.

00:27:47.619 --> 00:27:50.619
The same week that my dad died, we had a meeting.

00:27:50.619 --> 00:27:52.619
And my sister, Raquel, had a talk.

00:27:52.619 --> 00:27:59.619
And even though my dad had died the day before, she gave her part in the meeting the very next day.

00:27:59.619 --> 00:28:02.619
That next week, we had an assembly.

00:28:02.619 --> 00:28:04.619
We didn't miss it.

00:28:04.619 --> 00:28:09.619
So we wanted to follow that pattern that my dad had left.

00:28:09.619 --> 00:28:13.619
It was very difficult and complicated.

00:28:13.619 --> 00:28:18.619
But Jova always took first place in all the decisions we made.

00:28:18.619 --> 00:28:25.619
They were always made while thinking of Jova and the loyalty that my dad always had shown toward him.

00:28:27.859 --> 00:28:32.859
I carried on as if he was alive, trying to keep all my sisters together.

00:28:32.859 --> 00:28:35.859
And in the truth, you know.

00:28:35.859 --> 00:28:38.859
At first, I prayed to Jova for peace.

00:28:38.859 --> 00:28:41.859
Give me the peace that surpasses all understanding.

00:28:41.859 --> 00:28:45.859
And now, when there is something that is harder, I say to Jova, Jova,

00:28:45.859 --> 00:28:48.859
preserve the peace that you have already given me.

00:28:48.859 --> 00:28:51.859
Don't let this trial take away my peace.

00:28:51.859 --> 00:28:56.180
And that's when Jova strengthens me.

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:59.180
Well, I'm very fond of my sisters.

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:04.180
I have a lot of respect for them because they were like extra mothers to me.

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:10.180
Three of my sisters still live in Colombia, so we make sure to stay in touch on the phone or on Zoom.

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:12.180
That way they can see how mom is doing.

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:20.289
Some of my relatives who are not witnesses wanted to have some of my sisters look with them to finish raising them.

00:29:20.289 --> 00:29:25.289
But we didn't want our family to be split up because that was not my dad's plan.

00:29:25.289 --> 00:29:31.289
His plan was for all of us to make it into the new world serving Jova together.

00:29:31.289 --> 00:29:39.289
All his efforts, all his life, and all that he devoted to Jova are not going to be in vain just because he was no longer with us.

00:29:39.289 --> 00:29:42.289
We can't let that all go away.

00:29:42.289 --> 00:29:53.289
My dad taught me so many simple things about creation and about Jova that instilled love for Jova in me.

00:29:54.289 --> 00:30:01.289
That was something that I didn't know at that time was going to help me to move forward.

00:30:01.289 --> 00:30:06.289
But then I always say, wow, dad's not here.

00:30:06.289 --> 00:30:09.289
But he left me another father, Jova.

00:30:09.289 --> 00:30:14.210
And that's what's helped me to move on.

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:21.210
In paradise, what I long for the most is those last words that he said,

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:26.210
Jova, my wife, my daughters, is to be able to stay to him.

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:30.210
Look, here they are. We are all here.

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:39.349
We made it. You did a good job.

00:30:39.349 --> 00:30:45.349
As my Tay said, their parents truly lived the truth.

00:30:45.349 --> 00:30:54.349
Their example nurtured in their children a deep love for Jova and built a sure hope in the promises to come.

00:30:55.349 --> 00:31:04.349
Parents, your efforts to build faith in your children can produce a lifetime of benefits.

00:31:04.349 --> 00:31:08.349
Listen to what these young ones say about the paradise.

00:31:08.349 --> 00:31:19.160
In paradise, everyone is happy, they have fun, and it's a very beautiful place.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:27.160
You can live forever in paradise so you can become friends with everyone from all over the world and become one big family.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:35.160
In paradise, there are mountains, forests, rivers, lots of flowers.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:41.160
And you can hear people singing and laughing. It's exciting.

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:47.269
You can't really go near animals and play with them now.

00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:53.269
But in paradise, they won't hurt you or try to bite you so you can play with them and have fun.

00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:58.029
I want to have a race with the cheetahs in the paradise.

00:31:58.029 --> 00:32:08.329
In paradise, Satan will be no more, so fun will continue forever.

00:32:08.329 --> 00:32:15.329
The meek will possess the earth and they will find exclusive delight in the abundance of peace.

00:32:15.329 --> 00:32:20.740
Now, I can recite the scripture by heart.

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:24.740
Right now, there are a lot of disasters and crimes.

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:29.740
But in paradise, there are going to be lots of good and happy things.

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:31.740
There will be smiles everywhere.

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:38.690
Sophia was imagining that she was in a garden full of butterflies.

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:44.960
And Sophia's imagination about paradise.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:49.960
She saw the little lizard-like girl that worked in Neumann's house.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.960
And she played with a lot of different butterflies.

00:32:52.960 --> 00:33:00.940
Caleb and Sophia's dad said that it's good to picture yourself in paradise.

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:03.940
Because you can rejoice in the hope.

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:09.940
By thinking about myself in the beautiful paradise, I can be patient during hard times.

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:22.730
I want to live with my family and animals in a tree house with a swing and a slide.

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:27.730
Here in paradise, birds are singing happily. This is me and my family.

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:35.589
I want to meet David.

00:33:35.589 --> 00:33:41.589
It's because I want to know why he had so much trust in Jehovah and how he could be so courageous.

00:33:41.589 --> 00:33:50.349
I want to meet resurrected Daniel in paradise and ask him how he felt when he was thrown into the lion's pit.

00:33:50.349 --> 00:33:58.140
Jehovah promises so many fun and happy things.

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:01.140
I think he is a kind God.

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:08.929
Jehovah is really powerful and has a lot of wisdom.

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:10.929
And he is also kind.

00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:15.619
I think he is just really great.

00:34:15.619 --> 00:34:17.619
Jehovah never lies.

00:34:17.619 --> 00:34:30.179
So all his words come true and he is a very loving God.

00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:34.179
Jehovah loves you young ones.

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:40.179
He wants you, your family, and all who love him to be in paradise.

00:34:40.179 --> 00:34:43.179
Learn all you can about the Bible.

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:50.809
And when you do, you'll make Jehovah your best friend.

00:34:50.809 --> 00:34:53.809
The Bible is a treasure trove.

00:34:53.809 --> 00:34:57.809
But discovering its spiritual gems takes effort.

00:34:57.809 --> 00:35:07.809
To help us develop good personal study habits, the governing body is pleased to introduce a new series.

00:35:07.809 --> 00:35:11.809
Dig for treasures.

00:35:11.809 --> 00:35:17.809
In our first episode, we explore the Book of Hosea.

00:35:17.809 --> 00:35:31.820
The Book of Hosea is packed with spiritual treasure, wouldn't you say?

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:33.820
Yeah, absolutely.

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:39.820
It reveals aspects of Jehovah's personality, his sovereignty, and there's so much we can apply ourselves.

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:42.820
We just have to know how to find the treasure.

00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:45.820
In that case, let's dig into Hosea.

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:46.820
Love too.

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:50.820
So a good way to start is by watching the introduction to Hosea video.

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:52.820
It gives an overview of the book.

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:55.820
It helps us to understand the historical context.

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.820
And most importantly, it shows how it connects to God's kingdom.

00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:00.820
That's a great study tale.

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:02.820
Hey, thanks.

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:11.820
The video mentioned that Hosea's career as a prophet continued for about 60 years during a time of great political turmoil in Israel.

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:15.820
That wouldn't have been an easy assignment on its own.

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:19.820
But we can start to dig deeper by asking some questions.

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:24.820
Asking questions is such a fundamental step in digging for treasures.

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:29.820
So for example, how did Jehovah choose to start Hosea's prophetic career?

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.820
Hosea 12 says,

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:36.820
Go, marry a woman of prostitution, and have children of prostitution.

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:46.820
Yeah, can you imagine the first thing that Jehovah tells you as a prophet is that he wants you to marry a woman who's going to be unfaithful to you?

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:48.820
I wonder how he felt.

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:51.820
What was his initial response?

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:56.820
What went through his mind, knowing that marital infidelity awaited him.

00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:02.820
Many who have gone through that circumstance say that it's an excruciating and devastating experience.

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:05.820
But that's not all.

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:07.820
That verse also mentions,

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:10.820
have children of prostitution.

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:13.820
So there were children involved.

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:15.820
Hosea and Goomer had a son together,

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:20.820
but later Goomer had two other children, likely out of wedlock.

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:23.820
I wonder what that was like for Hosea.

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:24.820
Right?

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:26.820
And if they weren't his,

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:28.820
when did he find out?

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:31.820
How did he feel taking care of these children?

00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:35.820
There are so many questions we can ask to make the account real.

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:39.820
Now, I've been asked this before, and I'm sure you have two.

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:45.820
Why would Jehovah ask Hosea to put himself in such a painful family situation?

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:47.820
It doesn't seem right.

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:49.820
How would you respond to that?

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:53.820
It's such an important question when we're digging for treasures.

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:55.820
So think about it.

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:57.820
Jehovah really told him why,

00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:59.820
in that same verse where he commissioned him.

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:06.820
Because by prostitution, the land has turned completely away from following Jehovah.

00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:08.820
The all scripture book says,

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:12.820
Israel had been the Jehovah like a wife,

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:15.820
who had become unfaithful, committing fornication.

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:19.820
Yet he would show his love for her and try to recover her.

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:24.820
Hosea's wife, Gomer, could accurately illustrate this.

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:30.820
So, by having Hosea experience something similar to what Jehovah was going through with Israel,

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:35.820
Hosea could better empathize and communicate how deeply the people had hurt Jehovah.

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:41.820
Yeah, I can only imagine the weight that gave to Hosea's words.

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:44.820
Now, here's the big question.

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:47.820
What does this reveal about Jehovah's personality?

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:49.820
What stands out to you?

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:52.820
Here's something surprising about this account.

00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:56.820
How, Jehovah told Hosea to take Gomer back.

00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:59.820
Hosea chapter 3 verse 1 says,

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:06.820
Go once again, love the woman who is loved by another man and is committing adultery.

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:13.820
Just as Jehovah loves the people of Israel while they turn to other gods,

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:17.820
Hosea taking Gomer back wasn't to be mechanical.

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:21.820
Jehovah told Hosea to love this woman again.

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:26.820
Yeah, that's a much different response than simply pretending everything is okay.

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:29.820
That's restoration.

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:33.820
So, it shows that even though Jehovah was deeply hurt,

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:37.820
he still loved Israel and wanted them to return.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:39.820
And not just out of obligation,

00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:44.820
he wanted to restore that loving intimate relationship.

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:46.820
That's Jehovah's loyal love.

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:49.820
What a glimpse into Jehovah's personality.

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:51.820
And really, his sovereignty.

00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:55.820
He is not only loyal, he is a god of loyal love.

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:57.820
Outstanding.

00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:02.820
Okay, so the next step, make it personal.

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:07.820
The study tips on the back of the watchtower suggest, identify lessons and apply them.

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:10.820
So, let's take a way.

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:14.820
Disloyalty causes Jehovah so much pain.

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:17.820
But the opposite is also true.

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:21.820
When we imitate Jehovah's loyal love, he must be so pleased.

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:26.820
So, when we do our best to maintain a loving atmosphere in our marriage,

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:30.820
even though it isn't easy, or if we feel mistreated.

00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:34.820
When we are loyal to our brothers and sisters and work to restore a damaged relationship,

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:39.820
even when they hurt us, we make Jehovah happy.

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:42.820
Yeah, we're imitating him.

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:46.820
It's not mechanical, it's an act of loyal love.

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:50.820
We don't just forgive, we love.

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:52.820
Another takeaway.

00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:55.820
Maybe we've hurt Jehovah by our actions in the past.

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:59.820
Those memories may stay with us even if we've repented and gained forgiveness.

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:02.820
We might find it hard to forgive ourselves.

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:06.820
But that's not how Jehovah wants us to feel.

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:08.820
Just like with the Israelites,

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:14.820
he still wants to be our God and assure us of his forgiveness and loyal love.

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:19.820
Remembering this account can give us peace when we've made a mistake.

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:23.820
Look at what we can find with just a few steps.

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:27.820
Getting an overview from the introduction video.

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:31.820
Asking questions to dig into the details in context.

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:37.820
Looking for what it teaches us about Jehovah's personality and then making it personal.

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:41.820
The book of Hosea is packed with such gems.

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:44.820
And we didn't even dig everything out of those verses.

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:48.820
Why did Jehovah require Hosea to pay to buy Gomer back?

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:51.820
What do the names of the children reveal about Jehovah?

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:55.820
Why did Jehovah hold out a hope of a future king from David's line?

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:59.820
How can I imitate Hosea's example of accepting challenging assignments?

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:02.820
There is still so much there.

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:04.820
Then let's keep going.

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:08.820
There's no end to the treasure we can find in the book of Hosea.

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:15.820
When we dig for treasures, we immerse ourselves in the lives of people like us.

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:18.820
We witnessed Jehovah's qualities in action.

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:23.820
And what we learn, we can apply in our daily lives.

00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:30.820
In future episodes, we'll dig into Amos, Micah, Habakkuk,

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:35.820
and other Bible books sometimes called The Minor Profits.

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:45.820
We hope this new series inspires and equips you to discover treasures in your personal studies.

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:52.820
We make Jehovah happy when he sees us doing our best to serve him.

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:57.820
What are other benefits of knowing that Jehovah sees all the good we do?

00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:05.820
That question is answered in this morning worship talk presented by Brother John Ekran.

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:13.820
So how can we benefit from knowing that Jehovah sees all the good that we do?

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:19.820
Our friends, our workmates and family, they see some of the good that we do.

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:24.820
But no friend relative or even mate can see all the good that we do.

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:26.820
But Jehovah does.

00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:30.820
Say, when we defend a friend who isn't there to defend themselves,

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:36.820
or we resisted a temptation, or our prayers for others that only Jehovah knows about.

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:41.820
Unfortunately, we don't have to report every good deed to Jehovah.

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:43.820
We're listed in our prayers at night.

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:46.820
Here's all the good things that we did that day.

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:52.820
We're content with knowing that Jehovah saw them all and was pleased with us.

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:58.820
Jesus was content with knowing that Jehovah saw and was pleased with what he was doing.

00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:04.230
If we look at John chapter 8 and verse 29,

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:07.230
John chapter 8 and verse 29,

00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:10.230
he says, and though one who sent me is with me,

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:17.230
he did not abandon me to myself because I always do the things pleasing to him.

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:22.230
So Jesus knew that he was not alone in seeing the good things that he was doing.

00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:26.230
Even if he was falsely accused or as a poser's light about him,

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:30.230
he knew that he was doing the things that were pleasing to Jehovah.

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:33.230
Well, what lesson is there for us in that?

00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:35.230
It's very comforting.

00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:38.230
Jehovah sees all the good that we do,

00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:43.480
and nothing good that we do is missed by him.

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:52.480
Well, how can knowing that Jehovah sees all the good that we do help us when we're falsely accused?

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.480
This is what you said.

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.480
No, I didn't say that.

00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:01.480
Sometimes we wish you had a recording, or you could go back in time.

00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:05.480
But sometimes, of course, it doesn't make a difference no matter what you say.

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:12.480
You think of how Maphibosheth may have felt when slandered by Zyba to King David.

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:17.480
Do you think Maphibosheth wished he had an eyewitness or a recording?

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:20.480
You know, to kind of illustrate the power of an eyewitness,

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:22.480
I want you to imagine a traffic accident.

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:25.480
You're just sitting at a stop sign,

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:29.480
and another car comes around the corner and runs right into you.

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:32.480
Now, when the police come, shockingly,

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:35.480
the person who ran into you says you ran into them,

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:38.480
and the police believe them.

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:40.480
You take the matter to court.

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:46.480
The judge listens as the other person testifies in detail how you ran into them.

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:49.480
But before you can say anything,

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:54.480
the judge says, no, that is not what happened.

00:45:54.480 --> 00:46:01.480
I was walking on the sidewalk that day, and I saw the whole thing.

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:07.480
Now, who would imagine that the judge in your case actually was an eyewitness?

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:09.480
You say to yourself, well, if I had known that,

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:13.480
I wouldn't have been so worried about what was going to happen in court today.

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:17.480
Now, while it's extremely unlikely that you're going to go to court,

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:21.480
and the judge is going to be an eyewitness for you,

00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:25.480
but this does illustrate the peace of mind that we can have in knowing

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:30.480
that Jehovah is an eyewitness to all that happens.

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:33.480
So the lesson for us, when we're falsely accused,

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:41.480
it is of great comfort for us to know that Jehovah was there that day and saw the whole thing.

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:50.139
Now, knowing that Jehovah sees all the good that we do can also help us avoid putting on a pretense.

00:46:50.139 --> 00:46:56.139
Jehovah is not fooled by people who do good deeds just to be seen by others.

00:46:56.139 --> 00:47:01.139
The Pharisees of Jesus' day, they just loved to put on a pretense of righteousness.

00:47:01.139 --> 00:47:06.139
And Jesus tells an illustration that really exemplified that point.

00:47:06.139 --> 00:47:13.139
If we go to Luke chapter 18 and verses 9 through 14,

00:47:13.139 --> 00:47:20.469
that's Luke 18 verses 9 through 14.

00:47:20.469 --> 00:47:25.469
It says, he also told this illustration to some who trusted in their own righteousness

00:47:25.469 --> 00:47:28.469
and who considered others as nothing.

00:47:28.469 --> 00:47:33.469
Two men went up into the temple to pray, the one of Pharisee and the other attacks collector.

00:47:34.469 --> 00:47:38.469
The Pharisees stood and began to pray these things to Himself.

00:47:38.469 --> 00:47:42.469
Oh, God, I thank You that I'm not like everyone else,

00:47:42.469 --> 00:47:48.469
extortioners and unrighteous and adulterers, or even like this tax collector.

00:47:48.469 --> 00:47:53.469
I fast twice a week. I give the tenth of all things I acquire.

00:47:53.469 --> 00:47:57.469
But the tax collector, standing at a distance,

00:47:57.469 --> 00:48:01.469
was not willing even to raise his eyes, heavenward,

00:48:01.469 --> 00:48:07.469
but kept beating his chest saying, oh, God, be gracious to me, a sinner.

00:48:07.469 --> 00:48:12.469
I tell you, this man went down to his home and proved more righteous than that Pharisee,

00:48:12.469 --> 00:48:16.469
because everyone who exalts himself will be humiliated,

00:48:16.469 --> 00:48:20.780
but whoever humbles himself will be exalted.

00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:27.780
So the Pharisee was trying to impress Jehovah with listing all of his so-called good deeds.

00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:30.780
And it's true, Jehovah sees all the good that we do,

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:33.780
but he also sees the motive behind it.

00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:39.780
We never want to fool ourselves that simply doing good things that others can see

00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:44.780
does not hide who we really are from Jehovah.

00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:50.780
The lesson for us is the good things that we do are because we love Jehovah,

00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:56.639
not because we want praise or credit from others.

00:48:56.639 --> 00:49:01.639
We believe that Jehovah sees all the good that we do also makes us comfortable

00:49:01.639 --> 00:49:05.639
with Jehovah as our judge.

00:49:05.639 --> 00:49:08.639
We're all going to be judged by Jehovah.

00:49:08.639 --> 00:49:15.639
Eventually, we'll all be judged as either worthy of life or judged as worthy of death.

00:49:15.639 --> 00:49:17.639
How comforting it is to know that Jehovah,

00:49:17.639 --> 00:49:21.639
the one who's going to make that life or death decision,

00:49:21.639 --> 00:49:25.639
is someone who knows everything about us.

00:49:25.639 --> 00:49:30.639
The judge we mentioned in the illustration earlier, you didn't even have to testify.

00:49:30.639 --> 00:49:35.889
The judge already knew exactly what had happened.

00:49:35.889 --> 00:49:39.889
Have you ever thought after someone compliments you or says you're great

00:49:39.889 --> 00:49:41.889
or you did something wonderful?

00:49:41.889 --> 00:49:45.889
You think to yourself, yeah, but you really don't know me that well.

00:49:45.889 --> 00:49:51.889
On the other hand, there are people who know you really well.

00:49:51.889 --> 00:49:53.889
They've known you for many years.

00:49:53.889 --> 00:49:57.889
They've been through some good times and some bad times with you,

00:49:57.889 --> 00:50:00.889
yet they still love you.

00:50:00.889 --> 00:50:06.889
And you think to yourself, wow, with all they know about me and all that we've been through,

00:50:06.889 --> 00:50:08.889
they still love me.

00:50:08.889 --> 00:50:11.889
That's amazing.

00:50:11.889 --> 00:50:14.889
Jehovah knows everything about us,

00:50:14.889 --> 00:50:18.889
even if we've made mistakes or sins.

00:50:18.889 --> 00:50:24.889
If we repent and we continue to try to do what is right, he still loves us.

00:50:24.889 --> 00:50:29.889
Now, I have no doubt that as you take some time to meditate on our texts for today,

00:50:29.889 --> 00:50:34.889
you could come up with many more lessons to apply in our day-to-day lives

00:50:34.889 --> 00:50:40.889
by knowing that Jehovah is watching and seeing all the good that we do.

00:50:40.889 --> 00:50:46.889
You know, as we read earlier, Jesus said that Jehovah had not left him to himself,

00:50:46.889 --> 00:50:49.889
and Jehovah has not left us to ourselves.

00:50:49.889 --> 00:50:52.889
He is with us.

00:50:52.889 --> 00:50:54.889
He sees us.

00:50:54.889 --> 00:50:56.889
He knows us.

00:50:56.889 --> 00:51:01.889
And he loves us for all the good that we do.

00:51:01.889 --> 00:51:06.889
Jehovah is generous in taking the time to see us,

00:51:06.889 --> 00:51:10.889
not as a large group of worshippers,

00:51:10.889 --> 00:51:14.889
but as unique individuals.

00:51:14.889 --> 00:51:19.889
That's how we see each of our hardworking sisters too.

00:51:19.889 --> 00:51:39.480
This is beautifully expressed in this month's music video.

00:52:13.019 --> 00:52:15.019
I hope these words help.

00:52:15.019 --> 00:55:44.909
Dear sisters, you are wonderful examples.

00:55:44.909 --> 00:55:47.909
We appreciate all that you do.

00:55:47.909 --> 00:55:50.909
We love you dearly.

00:55:50.909 --> 00:55:56.909
In this month's program, we were encouraged to imitate Jehovah's generosity

00:55:56.909 --> 00:55:59.909
by showing hospitality.

00:55:59.909 --> 00:56:06.909
We uncovered a valuable lesson about loyal love in the book of Hosea.

00:56:07.909 --> 00:56:13.909
And we were reminded that the hard work parents put into training their children

00:56:13.909 --> 00:56:18.909
produces strong faith and a sure hope.

00:56:18.909 --> 00:56:26.909
For this month's postcard, we travel to French Guyana in South America.

00:56:26.909 --> 00:56:30.909
This is a lush, tropical land.

00:56:30.909 --> 00:56:34.909
Well, over 90% of French Guyana is covered in forest,

00:56:34.909 --> 00:56:39.909
fed by heavy rains from December to July.

00:56:39.909 --> 00:56:49.909
An extraordinary variety of plants, mammals, birds, and insects thrive here.

00:56:49.909 --> 00:56:55.909
Beautiful diversity is also seen in the people and the many cultures.

00:56:55.909 --> 00:57:03.909
Among them, Creole, French, Surinamees, Brazilian and South Asian.

00:57:03.909 --> 00:57:09.909
This land became a French colony in the 17th century.

00:57:09.909 --> 00:57:15.909
For decades, thousands of convicts were sentenced to forced labor

00:57:15.909 --> 00:57:20.909
in places like Royal Island, Devils Island, and Kuru.

00:57:20.909 --> 00:57:24.909
Happily, those things are in the past.

00:57:24.909 --> 00:57:29.909
Today, French Guyana remains part of the French Republic

00:57:29.909 --> 00:57:33.909
though it's more than 4,000 miles from France.

00:57:33.909 --> 00:57:40.909
Kuru is now the site of a European Space Agency Center.

00:57:40.909 --> 00:57:44.909
The Kingdom message first reached French Guyana

00:57:44.909 --> 00:57:52.909
when brother Olga Lawland, a zealous minister from Guadalupe, arrived in 1945.

00:57:52.909 --> 00:57:57.909
Over the next two years, he joyfully shared the good news in villages,

00:57:57.909 --> 00:58:01.909
gold mines, and trading posts.

00:58:01.909 --> 00:58:06.909
Though his stay was temporary, he planted many seeds of truth.

00:58:06.909 --> 00:58:13.909
Xavier and Sarah Noll, after graduating from Gilead in 1958,

00:58:13.909 --> 00:58:18.909
went to help a small group in the capital city Cayenne,

00:58:18.909 --> 00:58:25.420
which is said to be the birthplace of Cayenne Pepper.

00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:32.420
Soon brother Noll was conducting daily Bible studies with Christian Bonacaz.

00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:44.219
Within a short time, Christian and his friends became the first baptized witnesses in French Guyana.

00:58:44.219 --> 00:58:49.219
Today, an average of 3,000 publishers proclaimed the good news.

00:58:49.219 --> 00:58:53.219
Recently, two milestones were reached.

00:58:53.219 --> 00:59:02.219
A peak of 700 regular pioneers and a record memorial attendance of more than 11,500,

00:59:02.219 --> 00:59:07.219
nearly four times the number of publishers.

00:59:07.219 --> 00:59:13.219
Although most of the population is concentrated in and around Cayenne,

00:59:13.219 --> 00:59:19.219
our brothers work hard to find people everywhere.

00:59:19.219 --> 00:59:25.219
This isn't easy. Only 40% of the country's roads are paved.

00:59:25.219 --> 00:59:34.219
Some rivers have treacherous rapids, bearing names like Sofraka or Crash Rapids.

00:59:34.219 --> 00:59:41.219
And Ajuvat, which translates into, that's the end of it.

00:59:41.219 --> 00:59:48.219
Undaunted, publishers travel by boat to reach people in distant territories.

00:59:48.219 --> 00:59:57.219
Preaching is done in many languages, including Polycore, Tilly Wii U, and Mung.

00:59:57.219 --> 01:00:02.219
Three congregations serve the needs of those who speak Saramakan.

01:00:02.219 --> 01:00:11.219
Seven congregations and a remote translation office support the French Guyanae's Creole field.

01:00:12.219 --> 01:00:20.219
When our brothers gather for association, they enjoy dancing, singing, and playing music.

01:00:20.219 --> 01:00:27.219
A famous local dish called Wion Darawa can often be found on the table.

01:00:27.219 --> 01:00:36.219
This is a stew made of the pulp of Arawa fruit, and is typically mixed with smoked meats and fresh seafood.

01:00:37.219 --> 01:00:43.219
As we depart French Guyana, we receive warm greetings from our brothers and sisters

01:00:43.219 --> 01:00:51.219
who meet at the San Laurent du Moronee Kingdom Hall, and from the remote translation office in Cayenne.

01:00:51.219 --> 01:00:59.550
They say to us, New Cortezat, we love you.

01:00:59.550 --> 01:01:08.550
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
