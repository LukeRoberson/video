00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.629
Spain is a land of castles.

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:15.630
For the mountains of central Spain to the Mediterranean coast castles dominate the landscape.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.629
But there is one castle, the castle of Santa Catalina,

00:00:20.629 --> 00:00:26.940
that played a unique part in the history of Jehovah's Witnesses in Spain.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.940
This castle that guards the entrance to the harbor of Cadet in southern Spain

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.939
became a military prison over two centuries ago.

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:41.939
And this fortress tested the faith of around 300 Spanish witnesses.

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:51.320
The battle began in the 1960s when Spain was ruled by General Franco, a military dictator.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:59.320
Franco wanted all Spanish men to serve the Fatherland and this meant military service.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:06.319
But in Spain there were Jehovah's Witnesses, whose conscience said no.

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:16.319
So this castle became a battleground where Franco's military regime fought to stamp out the Christian conscience of those young witnesses.

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:22.400
But times have changed in Spain.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:30.400
The city of Cadet has organized an exhibition to salute the sacrifice made by those valiant witnesses.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:40.400
Over 40 years after their release, some of those conscientious objectors have returned to Cadet to attend this exhibition.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.400
At the inauguration, the mayor described them as citizens who spoke up,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:56.400
who presented arguments against the injustice, arguments based on peace, freedom, and above all, their conscience.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:04.400
Those who spent years of their lives behind bars have vivid memories of the times when this castle was their prison.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:13.800
I think one of the greatest challenges was never knowing if we would be granted our freedom.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.139
Our first sentence was for three years.

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:27.139
And since we still refused to enlist in the military, we were then sentenced again for another lengthy period.

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:32.139
So it seemed as if we had a life sentence.

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:37.139
We organized daily activities to keep us busy.

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:42.139
Mornings, we worked at our trades to earn a little money.

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:48.139
Afternoons, we set aside for spiritual activities.

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:57.680
Our preaching was unmainly by writing letters, and in this way some of us could even pioneer.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:06.680
A few people did reply to our letters, and we were thrilled to hear that some of these accepted the truth.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.680
Of course, we also preached to other prisoners, and a few of them became baptized witnesses.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:22.680
We also studied the Bible thoroughly, both individually and as a group, which proved vital in building us up spiritually.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.680
At first, we had to study our literature secretly.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:34.180
But later, the guards allowed us to have the Bible and other publications.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:43.180
As our numbers grew, all the witnesses were kept together in the same place, in the same barracks, so we could organize meetings.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.750
We even held assemblies, including the biblical dramas.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.639
And we loved singing kindon songs.

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:58.639
These songs really lifted up our spirits.

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:06.560
We really felt Jehovah's loving care when the brothers came to visit us.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.560
We even had a special visit from Brother Clan's Suta of the governing body.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:18.449
But there were also other visits that we really looked forward to.

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:25.449
Many of the brothers endured years of separation from their families and the ulcers.

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:33.449
This was a will test, but these faithful sisters wholeheartedly supported their neutral stand.

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.449
They were years that molded me spiritually.

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:41.449
I studied the Bible as I had never done before.

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:46.449
I developed the skills as a public speaker and as an overseer.

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:53.449
Above all, it was a time in my life when I learned to rely totally on Jehovah.

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:59.449
Thanks to my fervent prayers, he became my closest friend.

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.449
And he never let me down.

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:04.449
That was priceless.

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:11.449
The firm stand of those witnesses gave a powerful testimony in cadet and throughout Spain.

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:17.449
The run down military prison that once tested their faith has been restored.

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:22.449
It is now a tourist attraction, under cultural center.

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:30.449
But while the castle has changed, the faith of those valiant witnesses has not.

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:36.449
The castle certainly tested them, but they fought a fine fight for the faith.

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:41.449
And with Jehovah's help, they won the battle.

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:47.449
40 years later, their victory is still giving a witness to Jehovah's name.
