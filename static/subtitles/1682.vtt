00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.339
We recently met Mamuka Taktu Manashvili from the country of Georgia.

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:11.339
He was a high-ranking officer in the special forces there for many years.

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:16.899
What made him realize that defending his country is not the highest honor a man can have in

00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:18.579
his life?

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:43.420
This is his story.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.539
For 18 years, I served in a special unit responsible for presidential security.

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.780
This mission demanded total self-sacrifice.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.740
For example, the first and the last vehicles of the presidential escort belong to this unit.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:07.980
So if an attack occurred on the president, we were the first ones to be hit with the fire.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.579
For the last 10 years of service, I worked as an instructor and trained new staff to provide

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:15.140
presidential security in the future.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.780
Those working in this field must be fearless.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:27.719
They must be professionals, and that is what I taught to succeeding generations.

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:30.000
I just loved my job.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.239
I was a fervent patriot.

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:35.159
I had a special regard for the flag of my country.

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.519
In one bag, I always had weapons and the flag.

00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:45.439
Patriotism was so deep-rooted in me that I would beat up a person simply because he was

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.590
of another nationality.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.709
I always thought that God would never allow people like me to draw close to him.

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:58.189
One day, Jehovah's Witnesses came and preached to my wife and me.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.269
We were so interested in the truth that my wife even expressed a desire to study the Bible.

00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:07.269
Because there were rumors circulating about Jehovah's Witnesses, I decided first to make

00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:12.389
sure that everything was decent that their meetings, and only then allow my wife to associate

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:13.750
with them.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.270
After the meeting, I was absolutely thrilled.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.430
Everyone was well-mannered with friendly, smiling faces.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.629
I realized that there was nothing there to threaten my wife's well-being.

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:28.150
On the contrary, their association would be beneficial for her.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.310
During my wife and our eldest daughter got baptized.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.189
As for me, I enjoyed associating with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:37.830
Later, I also started to study the Bible.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.870
I knew that I had to make drastic changes in my life, but my job prevented me from doing

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.270
so.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.110
Moreover, I felt that door-to-door preaching was far more difficult than engaging in combat.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.430
I respected Jehovah's Witnesses for their courage and strength.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.229
All by little, I too was changing for the better.

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:07.060
I wanted to quit my job and inform my colleagues about my religious beliefs.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.939
So I wrote down all the Bible verses I had recently learned and then pinned them on the

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:15.150
wall in my office.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.430
I also started to think about how to make a living after leaving my job and decided to

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.430
learn a trade.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.430
I started to buy tools in order to be ready to take care of my family.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.389
I realized that the time had come to make a decision.

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:36.469
The day I quit my job was one of the happiest days of my life.

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:41.030
Since then, I have been able to dedicate every minute of my life to Jehovah with a clean

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.189
conscience.

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:45.909
In a few months, I got baptized.

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.669
In the beginning, we were hardly making a living.

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:52.110
However, this taught me to trust in Jehovah.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.870
I tried my best to keep service to Jehovah in first place.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:13.169
I deeply appreciate the support of my brothers and sisters and association with them.

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:18.329
Before I used to carry out the orders of men, some of which I carried out reluctantly.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.569
But now I am happy to carry out an assignment from Jehovah with the same spirit that the

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:27.610
prophet Isaiah had, who said, here I am, send me.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.129
As a family, we decided to move where the need was greater.

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:36.889
And this has united our family even more.

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.250
This is the bag in which I always carried weapons.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.089
But now they are replaced with the Bible and Bible literature.

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:47.810
In the past, I thought I could never preach from door to door.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.250
But now I can say with conviction that the words of Jesus have proved true in my case.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:05:02.170
All things are possible with God.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.329
Other tech to Manashvili now serves as an elder.

00:05:05.329 --> 00:05:08.529
And he's also been a regular pioneer since 2014.
