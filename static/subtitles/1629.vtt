00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.899
In the 1920s, Jehovah's People began using a new technology to further the good news, radio.

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:22.899
We built our own station, WBBR, but we didn't stop there.

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:29.899
We made radio history by linking our station with others around the world.

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:37.899
By 1933, 408 radio stations were networked together on six continents.

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:45.899
Millions worldwide could literally spin the radio dial and tune into the same watchtower broadcast.

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.899
Sound familiar? Well, we've come a long way since radio.

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:57.899
However, networking our technology continues to play a huge role in supporting the good news today.

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.899
As the work expands at world headquarters, there's an increasing need to collaborate with others,

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.900
whether from nearby complexes, other branches, or with remote workers.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:17.900
Having the ability to communicate easily and share electronic files with others anywhere in the world,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.900
expedites our workflow and saves precious donated funds.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.900
Under the direction of the coordinators committee, the computer department has been entrusted to care for this work.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.900
So what efforts have been made to keep us all connected?

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:43.900
Under the direction of the coordinators committee, the computer department was given the responsibility to establish a solid digital foundation

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.900
that could properly support the increasing collaborative needs of world headquarters.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:02:04.500
Just as it took several years of planning, design, and construction to complete the world headquarters site at Worldwick,

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.500
there has also been much computer-related work that needed to be accomplished behind the scenes,

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.500
and in advance to properly support the global reach of world headquarters and its related functions,

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.500
spanning over many countries and time zones.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:28.500
In recent years, the establishment of various world headquarters departments has made this need even more apparent

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.500
since they depend on satellites around the world to accomplish their work.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:40.500
Similarly, remote volunteers have been assisting branch departments with their heavy workload.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:47.500
Previously, this dynamic work was dependent on individuals meeting and working together in one physical location.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:56.500
However, thanks to timely direction, it has been possible to build a solid digital foundation to meet the organization's expanding needs.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.500
We would like to mention five technologies that have been instrumental in making this possible.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:16.270
First, in 2009, approval was given to provide a secure remote connection to the Bethel network from anywhere in the world.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:23.270
Certainly, there is a great benefit for the Bethel family in using the Remote Access Service.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:31.270
Initially, it was a small system that provide remote access just for a few number of Bethelites.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:43.270
But as the time passed, it became clear that it was necessary to expand the service so that other members of the Bethel family could connect remotely from anywhere in the world.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.270
This service has improved how the departments do their work.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:04:00.270
For example, Bethelites can now work outside and then send files back to the internal network, seamlessly, in order that others can view, edit and work within.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:07.270
Additionally, it allows computer support personnel to connect and provide technical assistance remotely.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:15.270
Brothers and sisters with the skills and experience needed by the organization can volunteer themselves to work from home

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.269
and connect to the Bethel network thanks to these systems.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.269
This has amounted to many cost savings.

00:04:22.269 --> 00:04:29.269
This is Jehovah's work and it is exciting to see how he has used this technology to speed it up.

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:44.000
In 2010, a gradual deployment of PC-based video conferencing capabilities began to be rolled out.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Seeing each other face to face helps to improve our communication.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Some brothers have commented that when they can see facial expressions, body language, it helps them to make a better decision.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Originally, the objective of video conferencing was to reduce travel expenses.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Now, whether it's from branch to branch between complexes or even in the same complex, with the touch of a button, we can tie our brothers together, start a video conference, share our desktop and begin collaborating on work.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Video conferencing also helps us to be better connected to those who are in the field, such as remote volunteers or Bethel consultants.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.000
This technology has not only reduced cost, but it also ties us together as a global Bethel family.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:37.000
In 2011, the deployment of a unified login system known as the Bethel domain was approved.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Before the governing body's direction to move to a unified computer login, it was very difficult to share information, collaborate on a project, even to log on to a computer in another branch.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:06:01.000
It is like our physical Bethel key. We can use our physical key in one site, but to go to other sites, we need to use our Bethel ID.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Similarly, while your branch log-on only worked for local resources, the unified Bethel log-on can be used in any branch.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Within just three years of the direction from the governing body, Bethelites worldwide were able to send email, plan meetings, share files, video conference, and take advantage of many other global systems now available to them.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
I still remember when we migrated the first RTO in Cambodia.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:39.000
You could see Bethelites eyes light up when they saw the Bethel address book for the first time and saw thousands of other Bethelites.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:51.000
One said, now we are really part of the Bethel family. All of this has really contributed to the unity of the Bethel family, allowing them to meet the ever increasing needs as Jehovah speeds up the work.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:07:07.750
Sending mail has always been an integral part of communication for the organization. The ability to receive Bethel emails on personal mobile devices was made available in 2012.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:15.750
I think it would be hard for most of us to remember a time when we didn't have email on our mobile device, our phone, or our tablet.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:22.750
For decades, email was a tool that was very necessary, but it was limited to just an office environment.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:32.750
Email mobility has helped to speed up the work of Jehovah's organization. Back in 2008, 25 individuals were approved to receive email on their mobile device.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:41.750
In 2012, it was extended to all branches as they were migrated to the Bethel domain. From just 25 users in 2008,

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:54.750
eight years later, the number of users exceeds 21,000. This valuable tool enables them to communicate regularly with their oversight and keep up with their work whenever and wherever they may be.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:08:07.920
An internet-based software platform that would further enable collaboration with thousands of our brothers in the field was implemented in 2013.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:16.920
This internet-based platform allows Bethelites and brothers and sisters in the field to work together using some of the same applications.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:24.920
For example, convention committees are leveraging this platform to plan conventions in 84 branches.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:34.919
Additionally, more than 84,000 Bethelites, remote workers, and other brothers in the field are using this software to accomplish their assignments.

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:43.919
It's expected that the number of users will grow exponentially in the future, allowing this platform to further support Kingdom interests.

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:58.919
The future looks even more promising as we continue to humbly seek Jehovah's direction while we take advantage of newer technologies to properly support the ever-expanding global reach of his organization.

00:08:58.919 --> 00:09:11.919
We in the computer department consider it a privilege to have a small share in supporting the governing body as they continue to provide timely direction to the worldwide brotherhood in this time of the end.
