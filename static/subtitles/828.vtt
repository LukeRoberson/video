00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.740
Do you know what time it is?

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.740
Most of us are conscious of time every day.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.740
We have a time to go to work, a time to go to school, a time to eat,

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.739
a time for our Christian meetings,

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:21.739
and even a time for association with our dear friends.

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:26.739
As the great time keeper, Jehovah reminds us at Ecclesiastes

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:32.740
at chapter 3 and verse 1 that there is a proper time for everything.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:38.740
And thus it's not surprising that the Bible speaks of the right time for various events.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.740
For example, at Leviticus chapter 26 and verse 4,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:51.740
Jehovah promised the obedient Israelites that he would bless them with showers of rain at the proper time.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.740
Well, that's just a detail probably for most of us.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.740
But if you've ever lived in a farming community or you've done farming yourself,

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:05.739
you know that rain at the right time can give you a bumper crop.

00:01:05.739 --> 00:01:12.739
But rain at the wrong time can completely destroy that same crop.

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:15.739
Even words can be spoken at the right time.

00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:18.739
Proverbs 15 verse 23 says,

00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:24.739
A word spoken at the right time, how good it is.

00:01:24.739 --> 00:01:31.739
Truly, it is a fundamental principle that timing is everything.

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:37.739
Well, think for a moment about prophesied events that took place right on time.

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:45.739
Jesus was baptized at precisely the time when the Messiah was prophesied to appear.

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:52.739
The kingdom began its heavenly rule right on time in 1914.

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:57.739
And looking to the future, Jesus said that Jehovah has set the time,

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:06.739
even the exact day and the hour for the end of this wicked system of things.

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:13.990
Does the governing body know when Armageddon is going to come?

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.990
Yes, we do.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.990
It's going to come right on time.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.990
We have full confidence in that, don't we?

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:30.990
That Jehovah is going to bring about those earth-shaking events exactly on time.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.990
But there's something else that Jehovah has promised to provide at the proper time.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.990
Would you go in your Bibles?

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:48.770
Let's look at Matthew chapter 24 and verse 45.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.770
Now here, Jesus posed this question, who really is the faithful and discreet slave,

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:04.770
whom his master appointed over his domestics to give them their food at the proper time?

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.770
Happy is that slave if his master on coming finds him doing so.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.770
Truly, I say to you, he will appoint him over all his belongings.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.770
Well, what did Jesus say here?

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.770
He said he would appoint a faithful and discreet slave,

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.770
who would provide the spiritual food, but there's another important detail there.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.770
Did you notice it?

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.770
He added at the proper time.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:42.770
Well, because of Jehovah's perfect sense of time, he knows exactly what his people need

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.770
and he knows exactly the right time to provide it.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.770
Now, just consider a couple of examples of this.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:59.770
Just as World War II was erupting, the November 1, 1939 issue of the Watchtower

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:05.770
featured an in-depth discussion of the topic of neutrality.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.770
That timing was absolutely perfect.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:18.769
Because of those articles, our brothers worldwide knew exactly what to do

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.769
as the war engulfed the entire planet.

00:04:22.769 --> 00:04:28.769
Well, after the war, as the organization was rapidly growing,

00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:36.769
Jehovah's organization arranged large international conventions that were held in New York City

00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:41.769
in 1958, a quarter of a million people, can you imagine?

00:04:41.769 --> 00:04:44.769
Overflowed Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds.

00:04:44.769 --> 00:04:48.339
Were any of you there?

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:54.470
Well, it's so wonderful. We still have a few people there.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.470
It's not that I wasn't in the truth at that time.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.009
It's just I wasn't in the world at that time.

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:08.009
Well, that amazing convention came just on time.

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:16.009
It energized God's people and we could say it put Jehovah's Witnesses on the map.

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:23.009
It was hard to ignore a convention of a quarter of a million people.

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:32.009
Well, fast forward to 2020 and a time when the world was engulfed in a global pandemic.

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:36.009
Large gatherings were prohibited in most countries.

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:45.009
Could we go to Yankee Stadium and have 250,000 people know, but right on time.

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:54.009
Jehovah guided the Faithland Discrete Slave so that our worldwide brotherhood could enjoy the convention program from home.

00:05:54.009 --> 00:06:00.009
Truly spiritual food at the proper time.

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:05.009
And during the pandemic, we've had to change our methods, haven't we?

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:12.009
We've had to receive direction about how to carry out our preaching work and how to carry out our congregation meetings.

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:23.009
But throughout this period, we have received powerful, powerful evidence that Jehovah has given this direction to us at the proper time.

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:26.009
Now, let me just give you a couple of examples.

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:40.009
During the 2021 service year, at least 22 branches have reported an all-time peak in the number of publishers.

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:43.009
Can you imagine during the pandemic?

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:55.009
For example, the Korea branch has reported a new peak in publishers every month during the 2021 service year.

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:58.009
Isn't that amazing during a pandemic?

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:18.139
And with so many wonderful things happening in the field, I'm sure that you're all wondering about our worldwide memorial attendance for 2021.

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:32.139
Well, by the undeserved kindness of our amazing God, Jehovah, we have reached an all-time peak crossing the 21 million mark.

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:35.139
Would you like to know the exact figure?

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:46.000
Well, keep on the watch. It'll be announced today at the proper time.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:58.339
Well, today in our program, we are going to have a wonderful buffet of rich spiritual food of many varieties and types.

00:07:58.339 --> 00:08:08.339
And by the end of the program, I'm sure that you'll agree that it was just what we needed at this moment in time.

00:08:08.339 --> 00:08:27.459
And by the end of the program, I'm sure that you'll agree that the number of
