00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.740
What can we learn about generosity and trust from Jehovah's use of the Holy Spirit?

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.460
First, let's consider generosity.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.140
If you had a monopoly on all the energy and fuel in the universe,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:25.379
would you distribute it freely and generously, or would you charge the highest price possible for it by Galen?

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:32.020
Well, what example does our father set when it comes to providing his Holy Spirit?

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.299
Please note the inspired words of the Apostle John at John chapter 3,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.859
and notice with me, please, verse 34. John 334 there it says,

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.939
for the one whom God sent speaks the sayings of God,

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:53.140
for he, Jehovah, does not give the Spirit sparingly.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.299
Now, the new American Bible says here, he does not ration his gift of the Spirit.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:06.579
Can you think of Bible examples from the Hebrew scriptures when Jehovah gave his Holy Spirit generously?

00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:10.819
Bezelel was filled with the power of God.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.859
Joshua was full of the Spirit of wisdom. Jehovah's Spirit empowered Samson.

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:20.340
What about in the Greek scriptures?

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.060
Well, John the baptizer was filled with Holy Spirit even from before birth,

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.099
and then there was the anointing of Jesus' disciples with Holy Spirit on Pentecost 33 CE,

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:34.340
which is referred to in today's text.

00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:42.500
Acts 2 verse 4 says that those disciples all became filled with Holy Spirit and started to speak in different languages.

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:50.019
Of course, Jehovah uses his Holy Spirit to accomplish different things in harmony with his purpose,

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:53.620
but there is no doubt that he provides it generously.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.939
Well, what about in our day?

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.099
Jesus' words reveal one of the ways that Holy Spirit is used in our behalf.

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:09.539
If you're still there in the book of John, notice Jesus' words in John chapter 14 verses 16 and 17.

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:17.860
He said, and I will ask the Father and He will give you another helper to be with you forever,

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.539
the Spirit of the truth.

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:27.139
This study note for John 14 16 says that the word helper could also mean

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:30.580
Comforter, Encourager, Advocate.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.460
Well, how can Holy Spirit be a Comforter?

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:39.139
Verse 26 mentions the helper, the Holy Spirit.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.219
That one will teach you all things and bring back to your minds all the things I told you.

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:49.620
Holy Spirit can help us to remember.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.099
It can bring back to our minds.

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:54.580
What does it help us to remember?

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.699
Well, many times it's comforting thoughts from God's word itself.

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.139
Consider just one news item from JW.org.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.780
In December 2021,

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:10.020
Pewter and his wife Maya received a three-year suspended prison sentence for discussing religious

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.460
materials with their friends.

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:16.099
When asked if he could recall an occasion when Jehovah helped him, Pewter said,

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:23.620
I recall a time when I prayed for Holy Spirit, and then I remembered a thought from John 1028,

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.900
where it says, no one will snatch them out of my hand.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.620
Reflecting on that point made me feel strong and happy.

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.699
I could sense that my Father was right by my side.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.860
As a result, I felt calmer and more confident.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.500
There it is, Jehovah comforting one of his servants with his Holy Spirit.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.460
Now, in what situations do you need the Holy Spirit to be a comforter,

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.219
encourager, or an advocate?

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.659
We all know our own plague, our own pain.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:07.620
Jehovah does too, and he will use his Holy Spirit to help us display love, joy, peace, patience,

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:14.819
mildness, goodness, faith, self-control, or other qualities that we need in our service to him.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.860
Although Jehovah has a monopoly on Holy Spirit, he isn't stingy.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.899
The greater our need for Holy Spirit, the greater his generosity.

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:30.100
Even though 8 million of Jehovah's servants may be requesting his Spirit,

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.660
it doesn't drive up the price.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.620
Holy Spirit is a free gift.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.779
Well, what is the lesson for us?

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.779
Let's allow Jehovah to tell us through his inspired word.

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:44.819
Proverbs chapter 3 verses 27 and 28.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.110
How can we imitate Jehovah's generosity?

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.910
Proverbs 3, 27 says,

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.949
Do not withhold good from those to whom you should give it if it is within your power to help.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.670
Do not say to your neighbor, go away.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:05.470
Come back later.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.670
I will give it to you tomorrow.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.910
If you can give it now.

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.750
The lesson.

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:13.550
Be generous like Jehovah.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.509
Fill the needs of others.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.589
What's the second point that we can learn from Jehovah's use of Holy Spirit?

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.470
Well, trust.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.029
How does Jehovah distribute his Spirit?

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.189
We find a clue at Philippians chapter 1 verse 19.

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:37.899
Philippians chapter 1 verse 19.

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:41.899
There it says,

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:44.540
For I know that this will result in my salvation

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.779
through your supplication and with the support of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:53.740
What does that mean?

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.899
The Spirit of Jesus Christ.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.019
Well, the study note on the Spirit of Jesus Christ says,

00:05:59.019 --> 00:06:04.300
apparently this refers to Jesus' use of God's Holy Spirit or active force.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.300
The study note continues.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.259
Acts 2.33 says that Jesus received the promised Holy Spirit from the Father.

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:12.860
At Philippians 1 verse 11,

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.819
Paul prayed that Christians might be filled with righteous fruit,

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:20.060
which is through Jesus Christ to God's glory and praise.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.620
We note it says,

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.300
Ever since Jesus was resurrected and he ascended to heaven,

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:30.860
God has used him to supply the needs of Christians on earth.

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:36.540
That no doubt includes pouring out God's Holy Spirit.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.019
That's a lot of trust.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.540
Well, it was Pentecost 33 CE.

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:48.860
The first time that the Son of God used God's Holy Spirit in behalf of Jehovah's,

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.620
that he used it to accomplish Jehovah's will.

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:56.459
Well, notice Colossians chapter 1 verses 15 and 16.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.000
There it says regarding the Son of God,

00:07:02.079 --> 00:07:04.160
he is the image of the invisible God,

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.759
the first born of all creation,

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:07.199
because by means of him,

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.279
all other things were created in the heavens and on the earth.

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:14.959
Jehovah, the creator,

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:19.839
used his master worker to bring everything else into existence.

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:25.519
Did Jesus need to use Jehovah's Holy Spirit to accomplish what he had been assigned?

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:27.439
That's obvious.

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:32.160
The book Come Be My Follower page 131 paragraph 8 says,

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:37.199
in some respects, we might liken this cooperation between Father and Son to that of an architect,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.800
working with a builder or contractor who brings the architects' designs to reality.

00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:48.319
Is that evidence of trust by Jehovah? Clearly.

00:07:49.439 --> 00:07:55.920
Jehovah gave his Son the materials and the training to accomplish an assigned task.

00:07:57.439 --> 00:07:58.959
Well, what's the lesson for us?

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.959
We find a principle at 2 Timothy chapter 2 verses 1 and 2.

00:08:07.579 --> 00:08:09.660
2 Timothy 2 verses 1 and 2.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:10.139
There it says,

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.500
Paul writing, under inspiration to Timothy,

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:13.980
he said,

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.259
you therefore, my child,

00:08:15.259 --> 00:08:19.740
keep on acquiring power in the undeserved kindness that is in Christ Jesus.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.259
And the things you heard for me that were supported by many witnesses,

00:08:24.139 --> 00:08:28.939
these things entrust to faithful men who in turn will be adequately qualified

00:08:28.939 --> 00:08:33.980
to teach others for generations of teachers and learners.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:42.299
The Apostle Paul, Timothy, faithful men and still others, the lesson for us,

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:47.580
continue to train, continue to delegate, continue to trust.

00:08:49.259 --> 00:08:50.299
So what have we considered?

00:08:51.179 --> 00:08:54.940
Jehovah is generous with his use of Holy Spirit.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.899
We should be generous with our time and possessions.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.980
Jehovah trusts his Son to pour out his precious Holy Spirit.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.820
We should delegate responsibility and trust others to fulfill their assignments.

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:10.940
Indeed, the Holy Spirit is a precious free gift from our generous Father.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.059
May we all continue to beg for it.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:19.740
Trusting fully and the one who can, according to his power that is operating in us,

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:24.620
do more than super abundantly beyond all the things we ask or conceive.
