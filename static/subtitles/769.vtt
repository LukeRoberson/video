00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:12.939
A very favorite part of our Gilead graduation program is the inside story where we get to know a few of our students a little bit more intimately.

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:17.940
So we're looking forward to hearing that now as it's presented by Brother Mark Numer.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.379
80 years.

00:00:21.379 --> 00:00:27.379
Those reaching this milestone in life are described as having special mightiness.

00:00:27.379 --> 00:00:30.379
But does that apply just to people?

00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:37.380
The 153rd class marks the 80th anniversary of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:46.380
During that span, the school has survived a World War country bands, legal threats, mob threats, and even a global pandemic.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.380
But we've done more than just survive.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.380
Welcome to this edition of the Inside Story.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:01:24.069
At 2 Kings chapter 13 verse 18 and 19,

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:30.069
the prophet Elijah told King Jehoash to take the arrows and strike the ground.

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:35.069
This was to indicate his zeal and enthusiasm for Jehovah's work.

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:38.069
Sadly, the King's zeal was lacking.

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:43.069
How about those taking the lead of Jehovah's organization today?

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:47.069
Have they been striking the ground with hearts full of zeal and persistence?

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:54.069
Yes, they have, and Gilead school gives irrefutable evidence of this.

00:01:54.069 --> 00:02:03.069
As World War II raged, Jehovah's spirit led our brothers to see the need for increased divine education before the end of this system.

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:11.069
The organization's president, Nathan Nor, directed the start of Gilead school in South Lansing, New York.

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:28.069
Starting in 1943, faithful men, such as Albert Schroeder, Russell Kerzen, Maxwell, Friend, Fredrick, Frans, and Eduardo Keller, instructed the first classes of students eager to go where people needed to hear the good news.

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:36.069
Since then, Gilead's location has changed, and instructors have changed, but one thing hasn't changed.

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:45.069
Gilead graduates have used their theocratic education to strengthen their brothers and sisters wherever they've been assigned.

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:55.069
As this world continues its downward spiral, Gilead continues to thrive and adapt as it meets the needs of Jehovah's growing organization.

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:03.069
And so with that, let's welcome our students and learn how the Gilead legacy has impacted them.

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:23.060
Please welcome our first guests, Brother and Sister Kunda, from Zambia.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.060
We are so happy to have you with us on the inside story, Kenna and Chilla.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.060
How long have you been serving in Zambia, and tell us about your assignments at the branch office?

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:40.060
We have been serving at the branch for five years now, and we're both assigned to the local design construction department, LDC.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.060
Beautiful. And here we see a picture of these smiling faces. There's you, both, and who are the three others in the picture?

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:52.060
Those three are three field representatives, and this was during a kingdom home build that we visited.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.060
We really enjoyed that assignment.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.060
Well, obviously you did. Look at those smiling faces. That's building kingdom halls.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.060
Kenna, you're working with LDC. How many kingdom halls are needed in Zambia?

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.060
So in the next five years, we need a thousand new kingdom halls, a thousand kingdom halls.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.060
Now that fast growth of kingdom publishers, that's something that is marvelous to see.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.060
In fact, what is the ratio there in Zambia?

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:26.060
Currently, there are a little over 190,000 publishers in Zambia, so that would make it approximately one witness to 99 people.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.060
One to 99, and that is just wonderful. So what do you contribute to that?

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:39.060
I could think of two factors. First, anyone who visits Zambia remembers it for its warm-headed people.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.060
They are very humble and welcome good conversations about the Bible.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:49.060
Excellent. Well, then that is something that is very attractive. The truth is attractive to them.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:57.060
Humble, warm-hearted. In fact, many people mentioned that to me that have visited Zambia as well. So good. What else?

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:04.060
The second factor is that the government is favorable towards Jehovah's Witnesses, allowing the preaching work to flourish.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:11.060
That's right. In fact, the work of Jehovah's Witnesses has been highly regarded as a stabilizing influence on society.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.060
And this in turn moves many honest-hearted ones to lend the truth.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:22.060
That's the training Jehovah gives his people. Wouldn't you say the training, the divine education that God's people have been given,

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:29.060
now that translates into how they teach and how they interact with people. Wouldn't you say that?

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:36.060
Absolutely. In fact, thanks to that divine education, Jehovah's people apply that knowledge in their lives,

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.060
others see it. And all praise and glory goes to Jehovah. Beautiful.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:50.060
So warm-hearted people, stabilizing influence in the community, growth, kingdom work and kingdom growth is happening in Zambia.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.060
There's something else that's dear to all our hearts that has had an impact on the kingdom growth.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.060
Well, what would that be, Chilla?

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.060
It's the Become Jehovah's Friend series with Kayla Bansafir.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.060
These videos have taught valuable principles to young ones very effectively.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:13.060
I like that. Valuable principles to young ones. So as these young ones are learning these Bible principles,

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:19.060
and that's instilled in their little hearts and minds, when they grow up, what's the result?

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:25.060
Yes, it's just wonderful to see how the organization is using the Become Jehovah's Friend series to the young ones,

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.060
because it's laying a foundation for them to become mature Christians when they grow up.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:35.060
So they have a pattern of making decisions that reflect Jehovah's thinking.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.060
They grow up, become pioneers and elders in the congregation.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.060
Excellent. And you were speaking about one that in particular?

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.060
Yes. We have a good example of that with Jamin.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:51.060
He's one of many young ones in Zambia who enjoys using the Become Jehovah's Friend series.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.060
Yeah, and here we see a picture. Can you explain that picture?

00:06:54.060 --> 00:07:00.060
So Jamin is closest to his dad on the left, both his parents, regular pioneers,

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:04.060
and they got his name from the video, warning examples for our day.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.060
There's Jamin again.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:11.060
Yeah, he's about six years old now, and you can see he looks very ready for the ministry.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.060
He does.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.060
Yeah, he enjoys using the videos because he's able to even recite them from the heart.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:23.060
And he goes as far as even imitating Sophia and taking some publications with him to school.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:27.060
And he does so good to the extent that even when he's packing the publication,

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.060
he has a friend in mind who he wants to give.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.060
But it's that evangelizing spirit at a young age that's taking root in Zambia

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.060
because of the Become Jehovah's Friend series. Excellent.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:41.060
Missionary spirit, here we go. Wonderful.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:47.060
But when you think about the legacy of Gilead school and the missionary spirit there in Zambia,

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.060
this is the 80th anniversary of the school.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:55.060
And also the impact in Zambia became very obvious early on.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:08:00.060
In fact, the first Gilead missionaries to arrive in Zambia was in 1948,

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:04.060
with brothers Harry R. Not and John Ferguson.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.060
And we see their pictures here.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:12.060
They were in the eighth class of Gilead along with Stanley Jones and Harold King.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:18.060
Those early days, those early classes of Gilead, 11% were of the anointed.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:24.060
And that led to a stabilizing influence as well in the global field with Gilead graduates.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:30.060
In fact, we went to the Gilead archives and we found some of brother Ferguson's handwritten letters.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.059
And there's one.

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:37.059
In that letter, he mentions that in 1948, when he arrived,

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:41.059
there were only 15,000 publishers in Zambia.

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:44.059
Back then, the country was called Northern Rhodesia.

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:50.059
But it was his prayer that the watch tower would be translated into the local language Chibamba.

00:08:50.059 --> 00:08:54.059
And he prayed for more missionaries to come.

00:08:54.059 --> 00:08:57.059
What a beautiful spirit. Was that prayer answered?

00:08:57.059 --> 00:09:00.059
Jehovah certainly answered those prayers.

00:09:00.059 --> 00:09:04.059
Today, we have all the study publications translated, not just into Chibamba,

00:09:04.059 --> 00:09:07.059
but into 12 other local languages.

00:09:07.059 --> 00:09:13.059
Beautiful. And now to date, some 58 Gilead graduates have been assigned to Zambia.

00:09:13.059 --> 00:09:18.059
So more publications, more translation, more Gilead graduates sent in.

00:09:18.059 --> 00:09:23.059
What a legacy now that the Gilead school has had in Zambia.

00:09:23.059 --> 00:09:27.059
I can say that those missionaries helped us in more ways than just the preaching work.

00:09:27.059 --> 00:09:29.059
Well, why do you say that?

00:09:29.059 --> 00:09:36.059
Around 1968, there was a ban on the work that resulted in the deportation of the initial group of missionaries.

00:09:36.059 --> 00:09:40.059
And this was followed by a wave of persecution and opposition.

00:09:40.059 --> 00:09:43.059
That made it a challenge to organize the work for the local brothers.

00:09:43.059 --> 00:09:47.059
In fact, at one point, it seemed like the work was stagnating.

00:09:47.059 --> 00:09:50.059
But in 1986, something exciting happened.

00:09:50.059 --> 00:09:52.059
What happened?

00:09:52.059 --> 00:09:55.059
Missionaries were allowed back into Zambia.

00:09:55.059 --> 00:09:58.059
I remember that too. We were missionaries in East Africa.

00:09:58.059 --> 00:10:01.059
And the lifting of the ban in Zambia was big news.

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:04.059
In fact, it excited us over in East Africa as well.

00:10:04.059 --> 00:10:06.059
We prayed for the brothers in Zambia.

00:10:06.059 --> 00:10:09.059
So we're so happy that things were able to move forward.

00:10:09.059 --> 00:10:13.059
That showed that the work continued to pick up after that in 1986.

00:10:13.059 --> 00:10:15.059
What happened after 1986?

00:10:15.059 --> 00:10:19.059
In fact, there was a great increase in new publishers.

00:10:19.059 --> 00:10:23.059
And so the missionaries helped the new ones to progress to maturity, stabilizing them.

00:10:24.059 --> 00:10:27.059
And speaking to the local brothers that served during that time,

00:10:27.059 --> 00:10:32.059
they especially appreciate how the missionaries helped them organize the work from the branch office.

00:10:32.059 --> 00:10:38.059
And from there, they helped the field thrive and experience incredible growth.

00:10:38.059 --> 00:10:41.059
So you're saying the local brothers, the missionaries work together,

00:10:41.059 --> 00:10:44.059
and that would have been positive results?

00:10:44.059 --> 00:10:45.059
Absolutely.

00:10:45.059 --> 00:10:46.059
Good.

00:10:46.059 --> 00:10:50.059
How did the local brothers respond when the missionaries came into work with them?

00:10:50.059 --> 00:10:53.059
I would say that was the best part.

00:10:53.059 --> 00:10:56.059
The local publishers came to love the missionaries.

00:10:56.059 --> 00:10:59.059
They were so kind and humble right from the start.

00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:02.059
It opened their eyes to the fact that we're all one and the same.

00:11:02.059 --> 00:11:07.059
And to see the missionaries try and say a greeting in the local language,

00:11:07.059 --> 00:11:09.059
it was nice to see.

00:11:09.059 --> 00:11:12.059
But to see them progress from just a greeting,

00:11:12.059 --> 00:11:15.059
then to holding a long conversation,

00:11:15.059 --> 00:11:18.059
and even giving a public talk in my local language,

00:11:18.059 --> 00:11:19.059
that was her warming.

00:11:19.059 --> 00:11:22.059
That must have been wonderful to hear and to see.

00:11:22.059 --> 00:11:23.059
Yes.

00:11:23.059 --> 00:11:27.059
And the missionaries also didn't rush their time with the local publishers

00:11:27.059 --> 00:11:30.059
and this helped them to learn more about the culture.

00:11:30.059 --> 00:11:35.059
For example, accepting a meal invitation after an assembly.

00:11:35.059 --> 00:11:38.059
They would be tired, and they would be hungry too.

00:11:38.059 --> 00:11:42.059
But this was not a quick meal at a restaurant.

00:11:42.059 --> 00:11:44.059
It meant going home.

00:11:44.059 --> 00:11:45.059
Getting food prepared.

00:11:45.059 --> 00:11:46.059
Yes.

00:11:46.059 --> 00:11:48.059
Getting the chicken ready.

00:11:48.059 --> 00:11:49.059
Exactly.

00:11:49.059 --> 00:11:51.059
And then it meant you ate late,

00:11:51.059 --> 00:11:53.059
and they had to go home late.

00:11:53.059 --> 00:11:58.059
But the highlight of this was the encouragement that they gave us.

00:11:58.059 --> 00:12:01.059
They encouraged us to pursue spiritual goals.

00:12:01.059 --> 00:12:04.059
We could see the love that they had for us.

00:12:04.059 --> 00:12:06.059
But most importantly, we could feel it.

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:07.059
Excellent.

00:12:07.059 --> 00:12:08.059
Do you agree, Kenna?

00:12:08.059 --> 00:12:09.059
Yes, I do.

00:12:09.059 --> 00:12:11.059
I experienced that at a young age.

00:12:11.059 --> 00:12:12.059
What happened?

00:12:13.059 --> 00:12:17.059
At one time, my family had a missionary couple over for lunch.

00:12:17.059 --> 00:12:19.059
Brother and sister Finch.

00:12:19.059 --> 00:12:20.059
We had a good meal.

00:12:20.059 --> 00:12:22.059
A wonderful time.

00:12:22.059 --> 00:12:25.059
But what we remembered from that day was something totally different.

00:12:25.059 --> 00:12:30.059
A few days after they left, the Finch sent us a small thank you card.

00:12:30.059 --> 00:12:35.059
They expressed appreciation for the time and shared a scriptural thought too.

00:12:35.059 --> 00:12:38.059
That they took the time to do this touched all of us deeply.

00:12:38.059 --> 00:12:43.059
In fact, my father used that card as an object lesson in teaching us children how to show gratitude

00:12:43.059 --> 00:12:45.059
when others do kind things for us.

00:12:45.059 --> 00:12:46.059
Isn't that wonderful?

00:12:46.059 --> 00:12:48.059
It's these little acts of love.

00:12:48.059 --> 00:12:54.059
These little stitches of love that make this close knit bond of loving brotherhood there in Zambia.

00:12:54.059 --> 00:12:57.059
Oh, there's brother and sister Finch there with you.

00:12:57.059 --> 00:12:58.059
Yes.

00:12:58.059 --> 00:13:02.059
You can see from the smile that they have become fully Zambia now.

00:13:02.059 --> 00:13:04.059
We're happy to serve with them.

00:13:04.059 --> 00:13:05.059
Excellent.

00:13:05.059 --> 00:13:07.059
And continue learning many valuable lessons from them.

00:13:07.059 --> 00:13:08.059
Good. Excellent.

00:13:08.059 --> 00:13:13.059
So what if we show now the audience a short video clip of Zambia and what's happening there

00:13:13.059 --> 00:13:15.059
and the work, would you like to do that?

00:13:15.059 --> 00:13:16.059
Yes.

00:13:16.059 --> 00:13:17.059
Absolutely.

00:13:17.059 --> 00:13:19.059
Okay, let's watch.

00:13:19.059 --> 00:13:24.059
Located in South Africa, Zambia is about a quarter of a million square miles,

00:13:24.059 --> 00:13:28.059
a little larger than the state of Texas in the United States.

00:13:28.059 --> 00:13:36.059
Zambia is home to beautiful forests, the mighty Zambia is a river, magnificent waterfalls and abandoned wildlife.

00:13:37.059 --> 00:13:38.059
Yes.

00:13:38.059 --> 00:13:43.059
And because of our marked climate, we enjoy a rich variety of foods.

00:13:43.059 --> 00:13:47.059
But the real beauty of Zambia lies in its people.

00:13:47.059 --> 00:13:51.059
You can find your harvest people almost everywhere you go.

00:13:51.059 --> 00:13:55.059
And the ministry continues to be ripe for harvesting.

00:13:55.059 --> 00:14:02.059
If you called on a person in the morning and a witness comes in the afternoon,

00:14:02.059 --> 00:14:05.059
in other countries they'll let you know that that's happened.

00:14:05.059 --> 00:14:08.059
And Zambia, they'll just listen a second time.

00:14:08.059 --> 00:14:15.059
When going from house to house, sometimes a person will invite you not to enter their house,

00:14:15.059 --> 00:14:18.059
but to sit under the mango tree.

00:14:18.059 --> 00:14:25.059
They bring their tins, their buckets, or whatever, and you sit there and then you can speak with them.

00:14:25.059 --> 00:14:30.059
And sometimes they even will collect their Bible from inside when they see you,

00:14:30.059 --> 00:14:32.059
because they know you're there to discuss the Bible.

00:14:32.059 --> 00:14:35.059
So they're very lovable people.

00:14:35.059 --> 00:14:40.059
The simple, friendly approach that the brothers and sisters have to the ministry,

00:14:40.059 --> 00:14:45.059
they're strong belief that everyone is a potential friend of Jehovah.

00:14:45.059 --> 00:14:49.059
That helps them to make spiritual progress with people.

00:14:49.059 --> 00:14:53.059
Can everyone in Zambia be a Jehovah's Witness?

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:56.059
Well, I think it's a good goal to have.

00:14:56.059 --> 00:14:59.059
Zellas Proclaimers come in all shapes and sizes.

00:15:00.059 --> 00:15:02.059
Would you like to see Jamie in action?

00:15:02.059 --> 00:15:11.940
I want to be like Jamie when I grow up.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.940
I know. Me too.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:20.940
Jamie is one of many young ones in Zambia right now that are making Jehovah's hearts so happy.

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:24.940
So, if you travel to Zambia, what will you find?

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:29.940
You will see a great crowd of loyal and hardworking Kingdom Proclaimers.

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:33.940
And while we're all different colors and ages and sizes,

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.940
we are one big happy family.

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:46.210
Thanks to a happy God, Jehovah.

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:49.210
Now, that was just a beautiful video clip.

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:50.210
Thank you so much.

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:53.210
But, Kenneth, the brothers' sister at the end with brothers' sister Finch,

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:55.210
they look like you.

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:57.210
That's mom and dad.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:01.210
And that's them meeting the features in almost 25 years.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:04.210
What a beautiful reunion that must have been.

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:06.210
And are they with us today?

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:09.210
Yes. In fact, they're somewhere in the audience.

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:12.210
Excellent. I bet they're very proud of you both.

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:13.210
Thank you so much.

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:17.210
And thank you for sharing your comments with us with the Inside Story.

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:26.210
Just watching this video helps us to see why the love and the joy of the Zambian people come through very, very loud and clear.

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:29.210
So, with that, we say thank you.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:42.340
Next, please welcome Eric and Megan Lee from Micronesia.

00:16:47.919 --> 00:16:51.919
We are so happy to have you, Eric and Megan, on the Inside Story.

00:16:51.919 --> 00:16:57.919
So, tell us, before coming to Gilead, you were serving in the Micronesia branch.

00:16:57.919 --> 00:17:01.919
And that is located on the beautiful island of Guam.

00:17:01.919 --> 00:17:06.920
So, how long have you been serving there and what's your work like at Bessel?

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.920
Well, I've been serving there for the last 10 years.

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.920
The last eight of those years, Megan and I have been serving at the branch office together.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.920
And I currently work in the service department.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.920
Good. And what about you, Megan? What's your work assignment?

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.920
I work in the translation department.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.920
And we support the work of six remote translation offices throughout Micronesia.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.920
Beautiful. I bet that's a lot of work.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.920
Thank you for doing it.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:33.920
Now, on our screen, we have a very interesting picture, Eric.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.920
What is happening here? Tell us about it.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:39.920
This is the two of us when we visited the island of Pompeii.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.920
We were sent there to help teach a Bethel service school.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.920
But this is when we first arrived on the island at the airport.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.920
We were greeted by the brothers and sisters.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.920
And they gave us what you see on the top of our heads.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:53.920
What is that?

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.920
Locally, those are called modemars.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.920
And they're hand-woven by the brothers and sisters.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.920
And they're often given to guests when they first arrive.

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.920
I mean, that's a lot of work to make those.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:09.920
And it shows the hospitality and love. Very nice. Thank you.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:14.920
So now, Megan, I understand you were born on Guam.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:18.920
So what was it like growing up on the island of Guam?

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:19.920
Tell us about it.

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.920
Well, it is a small island.

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.920
So no matter where you are, the branch office is never far away.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:30.920
It was definitely a special privilege to be able to grow up so close to Bethel.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.920
How far would the branch have been from where you were raised?

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.920
Maybe a little less than 15 minutes.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:36.920
Bethel was in your backyard.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:37.920
It was very close.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.920
Excellent. So how did that impact you?

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:44.920
It was very special to be so close to a center of spiritual activity

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:48.920
where so many brothers and sisters are working hard full-time for Jehovah.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.920
Eventually, my sister started commuting to Bethel.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.920
And she invited me to join her.

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.920
So we were able to do that together.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.920
Excellent. So you commuted to Bethel with your sister.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.920
And who's older? You were her.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:02.920
She is.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:03.920
She is. Okay. Very nice.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:08.920
But what a privilege to be together commuting there at the Bethel in Guam.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:09.920
And what about you, Eric?

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.920
Tell us about yourself.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.920
What about your family?

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.920
Well, my mom was born on Guam.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.920
Her side of the family is from there.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.920
But she grew up in Washington state.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.920
That's where she met my father.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.920
But something interesting happened for my mom before she was married.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:27.920
What was that?

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:32.920
Well, after she graduated high school, she took a trip to Guam.

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:36.920
And she was impressed by the need that was there.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:42.920
So much so that she had this strong desire to go back to Guam someday in order to preach there.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.920
We call that the missionary spirit.

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.920
And she wanted to go back.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:47.920
So tell us what happened.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:51.920
Well, my parents were married and they served in Brooklyn, Bethel.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:55.920
But in 1979, they attended Kiliat school.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:56.920
Oh, interesting.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:00.920
They had graduated from the 67th class of Diliat.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.920
And then my mom's dream came true.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.920
They got their assignment.

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:05.920
Their assignment was Guam.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:06.920
Oh, beautiful.

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:07.920
Excellent.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.920
They absolutely loved that assignment.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:13.920
And then some years later, my siblings and I came along.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.920
So then what happened?

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.920
Well, after some years, we moved back to Washington state.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:25.920
But even though we left Guam, something never changed for my parents.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:26.920
What was that?

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.920
Their love for the people of Guam never changed.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:35.920
So though they were geographically located outside of Guam in the United States here in Washington,

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.920
their heart was still in Guam.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:41.920
And did that influence you as a young man?

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:42.920
It sure did.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.920
They still had that missionary spirit.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.920
And they wanted to encourage us to reach out and do more.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:52.920
So one time as an entire family, we visited Guam.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.920
During that trip, I fell in love with Guam.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:56.920
You did.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:02.920
I loved it so much that when I turned 19, I decided to move to Guam by myself.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:08.920
And then at a convenient time, the rest of my family ended up moving out to Guam as well.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.920
And in fact, both my parents are still serving there now.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:12.920
Isn't that wonderful?

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:19.920
So your mother and father, their love for the people in Guam, evidently influenced you

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.920
because you fell in love with the people in Guam too.

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:23.920
I sure did.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.920
Especially someone very special.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:27.920
Excellent.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.920
So what do we see here, Eric?

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:36.920
This is a picture of my family just outside the kingdom hall that we attended when we were young.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:43.920
It's my parents, my older sister, my two younger brothers, and that is me standing in the back.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.920
And we have another picture too.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:50.920
This is again all of us, but when we're a little more grown up,

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.920
we were together on Guam at a convention.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.920
And now your parents are still in Guam serving there.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:01.920
What a good example they must have set, though, for you and the family and the siblings,

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:06.920
and how encouraged they must have been that you too had that missionary spirit.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:07.920
Beautiful.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:12.920
Tell us, how many publishers there are in Micronesia at this time?

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:17.920
Well, we have about 1,200 publishers that's throughout all the islands in Micronesia.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:23.920
And I know that number may not sound like much, but actually it is a really impressive number.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.920
And what makes it impressive?

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:32.920
Well, I think it's the fact that new ones face a definite challenge before they come in the truth.

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:37.920
The communities in Micronesia are very small, they're very close-knit,

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.920
and people really depend on one another for everyday life.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:47.920
So when someone becomes a witness, they can be viewed by their community as an outsider,

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:52.920
and they lose that connection to that support system that they've had for so long.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:58.920
So it's a real test of faith for them to trust that Jehovah can and will take care of them.

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.920
Yeah, must not be easy.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.920
It sure isn't easy for many of them.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:10.920
But despite those challenges, many honest-hearted ones courageously take a stand to join Jehovah's people.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:12.920
Beautiful.

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.920
And when they do that, they receive a wonderful blessing.

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:19.920
They end up becoming like a family to one another.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:23.920
So when there is that time of need, they're right there to help them.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:24.920
Beautiful.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.920
It's something that's very touching to see.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:30.920
So the love of Micronesia is obvious and evident.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:36.920
And can you relate another example of the Christian love there in Micronesia?

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.920
One that very quickly comes to mind for both of us is the island of Koshri.

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:41.920
Koshri.

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.920
Now, we don't hear often about Koshri.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.920
Can you tell us about it?

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:51.920
It's a very small island that has just one congregation of about eight publishers,

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.920
yet they're so faithful and loyal to Jehovah.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:55.920
Interesting.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:56.920
Faith publishers.

00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:02.920
But Jehovah's interested in this small group, just like in Noah's day, they were just eight.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.920
Koshri has about eight.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:08.920
So how was Jehovah's interest shown in them?

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:12.920
Well, it's very clear from the translation work that's being done.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:18.920
Jehovah's organization provides publications that are translated into their local language.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:23.920
It's just so incredible to see because what other organization would do that besides Jehovah's?

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:24.920
Beautiful.

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:29.920
But it is proof that he's reassuring them that he sees them and that he loves them.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.920
Oh, they must be thrilled with that.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.920
Thank you for sharing that very important point.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.920
So what do we have?

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:39.920
We have a paradesic assignment.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.920
But it does come with some challenges, as you say.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:46.920
The courage to stand up for one's beliefs.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:49.920
The islands just having a few publishers.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:51.920
These are challenges.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.920
Am I missing anything?

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:58.920
Well, something else that comes to mind is that some of these islands are so remote.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:01.920
And because of that, they don't always have very good internet.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:06.920
And that means it can be a challenge to get the spiritual food to our brothers and sisters at times.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.920
So how would they meet that challenge?

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.920
Well, a huge help has been the JW box.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.920
We see a picture of it here.

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.920
The JW box is a small device.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.920
It can actually fit in your hand.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:26.920
And the JW box can connect to the internet and download almost anything that's available on JW.org.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:27.920
Isn't that beautiful?

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:36.920
And then once it downloads publications and videos, the brothers and sisters can connect their personal devices to the JW box.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:42.920
And then they have access to all of this spiritual food without them ever needing to connect to the internet themselves.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.920
Now, that is a wonderful provision.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:51.920
And we thank the faithful and discrete slave to make sure the brothers and coast rye are spiritually nourished, beautiful.

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.920
The Gilead legacy.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:56.920
It continues on there in Micronesia.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:03.920
It was started back there in 1954 when the first Gilead train missionaries came to Micronesia.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:08.920
And we see a picture of them, that Sam Weiger and his wife Virginia.

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:12.920
And at that time, there were only about 12 publishers in Guam.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.920
But never despised the day of small beginnings.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:20.920
Because with their arrival, the Gilead legacy was set in motion.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:27.920
And now the Micronesia branch territory, it spreads over a large area with many islands.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.920
Yes. And some of these islands you can't reach by plane.

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.920
You can only take a boat to get there.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:41.920
So the branch office has organized preaching campaigns where boats of witnesses go to these different islands and preach there.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.920
And that's actually what we see in this picture here.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:47.920
So by boat, the brothers reach this island.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:51.920
And what are we seeing? Is this a congregation meeting or?

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:56.920
After a few days of preaching on the island, this was their last day.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:01.920
And they invited all the interested ones to come together to this group meeting.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.920
And what they did, they had a group Bible study.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.920
But they focused on teaching these interested ones.

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.920
How to study the Bible Teachbook on their own.

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:15.920
That way when the brothers and sisters left, they could still feed themselves spiritually.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.920
Oh, that is so encouraging. Thank you so much for sharing.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.920
So it's a beautiful island, true.

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:28.920
But it's the precious people in the island that are really benefiting from Jehovah's provisions.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:29.920
So what should we do?

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:35.920
Should we take a trip to the Micronesia islands and visit the brothers and see how they're doing?

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:36.920
Would you like to do that?

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:37.920
We'd love that.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.920
Good. Let's pay attention to the video.

00:27:42.259 --> 00:27:48.259
Located in the Western Pacific Ocean, Micronesia is one of three major island regions,

00:27:48.259 --> 00:27:51.259
along with Polynesia and Melanesia.

00:27:51.259 --> 00:27:57.259
The word Micronesia means small islands and includes some 2,000 scattered islands.

00:27:57.259 --> 00:28:07.259
Yet the islands are so tiny that their combined landmass is only about 1,055 square miles or 2,730 square kilometers.

00:28:08.259 --> 00:28:13.259
Not much larger than that of Rhode Island, the smallest state in the United States.

00:28:13.259 --> 00:28:19.259
The branch is located on the island of Guam, but is referred to as the Micronesia branch.

00:28:19.259 --> 00:28:23.259
Most people think of paradise when they come to Micronesia.

00:28:23.259 --> 00:28:27.259
But it's the spiritual paradise that is truly breathtaking.

00:28:27.259 --> 00:28:35.259
That's right. The brothers and sisters are hardworking and loyal for Jehovah's name.

00:28:35.259 --> 00:28:46.259
For example, on the island of Koshra, they may be a small group, but they are sending up a great shout of praise to Jehovah.

00:28:46.259 --> 00:28:53.259
What I love about our assignment in Koshra is that the people, they really have a love for the Bible.

00:28:53.259 --> 00:29:00.259
It's very easy to have Bible studies or long conversations with people.

00:29:00.259 --> 00:29:07.259
So it makes it very easy to talk to them about spiritual things, makes the ministry very enjoyable.

00:29:07.259 --> 00:29:16.259
In case you saw a family resemblance, that wasn't just our sister in the truth. That was Megan's real sister.

00:29:16.259 --> 00:29:23.259
We're so proud of them and all those exerting themselves vigorously to reach honest-hearted people in remote areas.

00:29:23.259 --> 00:29:26.259
And don't forget time zones.

00:29:26.259 --> 00:29:27.259
All right.

00:29:27.259 --> 00:29:32.259
The circuit we're currently in is made up of four different time zones.

00:29:32.259 --> 00:29:39.259
Eight different islands and from east to west, it's a distance of about 2,500 miles.

00:29:39.259 --> 00:29:42.259
And in our circuit, there's actually seven different languages.

00:29:42.259 --> 00:29:48.259
It's a lot of work each week. We pack our bags and then move on to the next island.

00:29:48.259 --> 00:29:54.259
The friends are never alone, no matter how far out they might be or how few publishers might be there.

00:29:54.259 --> 00:30:00.259
We see generosity, we see contentment, we see zeal.

00:30:00.259 --> 00:30:03.259
Jehovah's taking care of them.

00:30:03.259 --> 00:30:08.259
On these islands, the precious resources are definitely Jehovah's people.

00:30:08.259 --> 00:30:10.259
Absolutely.

00:30:10.259 --> 00:30:15.259
Micronesia may be remote, but once you're here, you're home.

00:30:15.259 --> 00:30:20.539
Eric, that was beautiful. Once you're here, you're home.

00:30:20.539 --> 00:30:25.539
Thank you for making it your home, too. And to meet your sister like that,

00:30:25.539 --> 00:30:29.539
I know you're proud of her. You said you were and we're proud of her, too, and proud of you.

00:30:29.539 --> 00:30:31.539
And that circuit over here, a couple.

00:30:31.539 --> 00:30:33.539
They're doing a great work, aren't they there?

00:30:33.539 --> 00:30:34.539
They sure are.

00:30:34.539 --> 00:30:40.539
Yeah, self-sacrificing spirit. We could say that the Gilead or the missionary legacy continues there in Micronesia.

00:30:40.539 --> 00:30:42.539
Thank you so much.

00:30:42.539 --> 00:30:49.539
Well, it's very clear that the Jehovah's blessing, the brothers in Micronesia, the work is thriving.

00:30:49.539 --> 00:30:54.539
And Megan and Eric, it's just a pleasure to have you with us, not just in class,

00:30:54.539 --> 00:30:59.539
but as part of the inside story, and we wish you the best in the days ahead.

00:30:59.539 --> 00:31:01.539
Thank you.

00:31:01.539 --> 00:31:03.539
So what do you think?

00:31:03.539 --> 00:31:07.539
Can a school have special mightiness? It can.

00:31:07.539 --> 00:31:13.539
If Jehovah backs it, and that's exactly what he has done for Gilead school.

00:31:13.539 --> 00:31:18.539
Repeatedly, it has been made clear that Jehovah's blessing the governing bodies

00:31:18.539 --> 00:31:24.539
efforts to promote and to support divine education throughout the earth.

00:31:24.539 --> 00:31:27.539
Why all this education?

00:31:27.539 --> 00:31:33.539
In the words of Brother Nor, we want to move to higher levels of understanding,

00:31:33.539 --> 00:31:39.539
so that we get deeper into the thoughts of Jehovah as he expressed them in his word.

00:31:39.539 --> 00:31:46.539
Therefore, nothing can stop divine education and nothing will ever slow it down.

00:31:46.539 --> 00:31:50.539
The world says 80 years is probably time to slow down.

00:31:50.539 --> 00:31:54.539
But to Jehovah's people, 80 is just getting started.

00:31:54.539 --> 00:31:58.539
Until the next time on the inside story.

00:31:58.539 --> 00:32:29.900
Thank you so much, Brother Numer, and those who participated with you.

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:31.900
That was just outstanding.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:35.900
Imagine 80 years of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:40.900
You know, we just remembered the other day that the brothers, when they initiated Gilead,

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:46.900
thought they would only have enough resources to be able to have the school for five years.

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:50.900
Amazing to think what Jehovah has accomplished.
