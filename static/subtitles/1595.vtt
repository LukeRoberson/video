WEBVTT

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.120
to tell good news to the meek ones.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.400
He has sent me to bind up the broken hearted.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:22.039
For all these years, it's hard-wired job.

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:24.550
I got to something.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.349
It's from Levin Island.

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:26.189
He's this.

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:27.469
It's the very best.

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:41.449
This is excellent, ma'am.

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:43.330
That's how it's got to be right there.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:03:01.039
Here to most people, that life was continuing on as usual

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:03.639
in Jerusalem.

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:07.159
Everyone carried on their daily tasks.

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:11.490
Men plied their trades.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.139
Women saw to their homes and families.

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:23.259
Children learned and played more than three decades earlier.

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:26.300
Jesus foretold events that would mark great changes

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.180
in the world we had known.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.500
For those of us who became as followers,

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.460
the signs of change were clearly visible.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.379
Your taxes are due, and this will cover it.

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:40.860
These are my belongings.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.900
You have no right.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:04:00.560
Realize how severely quality of our faith

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.159
would be tested by the events surrounding

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:27.100
the fulfillment of those prophecies.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.100
The idea how difficult it would be

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.699
to keep the prophetic word burning brightly in our heart

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:37.100
then know that the desolating of our is drawn near.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.870
Ziff, what did Jesus say we should do then?

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.470
The midst of a strong faith could guide us

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.939
through the night of uncertainty to come.

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:55.790
It all happened so quickly.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:03.029
The great Jewish revolt against decades of Roman oppression,

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:10.129
Rome's swift and brutal response.

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:47.920
There was hardly time to think.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.519
Once the fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:53.519
was unmistakably identified,

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:57.319
our first real test of faith came along.

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:00.519
The disgusting thing that causes desolation,

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:02.519
standing in the holy place.

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:08.300
That was an elder's meeting I would not soon forget.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:22.860
We to the mountains.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.860
Yes, how are we going to get out?

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.259
We have to get ready.

00:06:26.259 --> 00:07:17.410
All right, everything that we've worked for.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:18.410
What if they're wrong?

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.350
Don't think about it, Neum.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.959
I'm trying not to.

00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:27.860
To just walk away from all of this?

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.860
I know, it's not easy.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:45.920
But it's the right thing to do.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.720
Hey, remember when we were kids?

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.519
Wanted to be NASA, right?

00:07:52.519 --> 00:07:54.819
Yeah, I remember.

00:07:54.819 --> 00:08:22.089
You cut my hair real short so you could be stronger than me?

00:08:22.089 --> 00:08:27.639
I know we have to leave.

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:28.740
But how?

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:40.269
The city's surrounded.

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:47.799
Jehovah will open the way somehow.

00:08:47.799 --> 00:08:50.899
It's just all the unknowns that frighten me.

00:08:50.899 --> 00:08:55.970
I've never lived anywhere but Jerusalem.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:59.490
My brother's here.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:07.429
Enter business.

00:09:07.429 --> 00:09:25.509
How am I going to provide for you both?

00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:29.110
I have to trust that Jehovah has a better view of the situation

00:09:29.110 --> 00:10:15.669
than we do.

00:10:15.669 --> 00:10:17.769
Strategically, it makes no sense.

00:10:17.769 --> 00:10:22.909
But they aren't leaving.

00:10:22.909 --> 00:10:25.509
Sir, the reports are the same.

00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:28.110
In every quarter of Jerusalem, the 12th Legion

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:55.539
is marching toward the sea.

00:10:55.539 --> 00:10:59.740
It's madness, divide madness.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.240
It is deliverance.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:10.259
God has delivered the holy temple from the enemy's hands.

00:11:10.259 --> 00:11:15.059
They must feel the wrath of God upon their backs.

00:11:15.059 --> 00:11:16.460
Pursue them.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.059
Strike them down.

00:11:18.059 --> 00:11:20.659
As God struck the Egyptians in the Red Sea,

00:11:20.659 --> 00:11:22.259
overtake them and kill them.

00:11:22.259 --> 00:11:23.460
At least, aren't pleased.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.059
They're gone.

00:11:24.059 --> 00:11:25.360
Let's be gone.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.659
Punish them.

00:11:26.659 --> 00:11:29.360
They must never get harassed the people of God.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:49.039
Go.

00:11:49.039 --> 00:11:51.740
Make sure there's plenty of these cheaper wines available today.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.139
There's going to be a lot of celebration.

00:11:54.139 --> 00:11:55.539
What are you doing?

00:11:55.539 --> 00:11:56.740
Why aren't you ready to lie?

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.340
You just need a little more time.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.139
We'll be along.

00:11:59.139 --> 00:12:00.340
We'll catch up with you out on the road.

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.340
This is our opportunity to escape.

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:03.940
I agree completely.

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:07.740
It's the fulfillment of the sign, but it happens so quickly.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.840
I have to get things organized before we leave.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.340
In fact, you should be helping me, partner.

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:15.740
Name, listen to yourself.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:18.740
This is the destruction of Jerusalem we're talking about.

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:19.940
Thanks for your information.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.639
We've begun preparations for departure.

00:12:22.639 --> 00:12:25.340
Don't worry about us.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.240
Now, Gideon, I expect we'll be gone for maybe a week or two

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.240
with the most.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.440
We'll hurry.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.039
Make sure that all of the...

00:12:32.039 --> 00:12:35.879
You ready?

00:12:35.879 --> 00:12:37.879
He's opening the shop.

00:12:37.879 --> 00:12:59.639
I don't understand what he's doing.

00:12:59.639 --> 00:13:01.340
Southside, all of you follow me.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:02.539
We go out the gate and turn north,

00:13:02.539 --> 00:13:22.220
meet the main group on the west side.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.220
These are the important things.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:31.049
Will others come with us?

00:13:31.049 --> 00:13:33.950
How about just the four of us for now?

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:37.190
Others will join us on the road.

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:38.190
And let's go.

00:13:38.190 --> 00:14:09.049
I'm so glad we found you.

00:14:09.049 --> 00:14:10.049
Rachel, have you heard the news?

00:14:10.049 --> 00:14:12.350
Yes, we've heard that the Roman armies have left.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:13.750
And we're going after them.

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:16.049
They'll pay for attacking God's holy city.

00:14:16.049 --> 00:14:17.750
Correa.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.049
We have some news, too.

00:14:20.049 --> 00:14:21.549
We're leaving.

00:14:21.549 --> 00:14:26.019
Leaving?

00:14:26.019 --> 00:14:27.720
Why?

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.720
Where are you going?

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.320
You know what we believe.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.620
Jesus said that when Jerusalem was surrounded by armies,

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:36.720
that is the signal that a great tribulation is coming.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.919
The Romans are running away.

00:14:38.919 --> 00:14:40.720
This is a great day.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.220
They're deliverance.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:49.820
Correa, it's not Jerusalem that Jehovah's delivered today.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.820
It's his people.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.620
Here's people.

00:14:55.620 --> 00:15:03.259
Christians.

00:15:03.259 --> 00:15:05.659
What about me, Rachel?

00:15:05.659 --> 00:15:07.860
Your flesh and blood.

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.759
I pray at the temple.

00:15:09.759 --> 00:15:11.559
I keep the Sabbath.

00:15:11.559 --> 00:15:12.860
Am I nothing in God's eyes?

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.460
Correa, please.

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:16.860
You'll get my sister killed.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.659
Correa, please.

00:15:18.659 --> 00:15:20.360
You must come with us.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:28.820
It could mean your life.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.519
Just where do you intend to go?

00:15:31.519 --> 00:15:35.820
We're going to Pella in the mountains to the north.

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.620
Are you crazy?

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:42.200
That's a Gentile city.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.799
Besides, it's too dangerous to travel.

00:15:45.799 --> 00:15:46.799
You're safe right here.

00:15:46.799 --> 00:15:47.799
You come with me, Jesus.

00:15:47.799 --> 00:15:48.799
No, in Pella.

00:15:48.799 --> 00:15:49.700
We have three.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.899
Winter is coming.

00:15:50.899 --> 00:15:51.899
How you live?

00:15:51.899 --> 00:15:53.200
Jehovah will protect us.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.500
Everything you know

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.570
is right here.

00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:59.269
You see how foolish you're being.

00:15:59.269 --> 00:16:04.870
Hi, let's move out.

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:22.480
You're all the family I have left.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:26.600
Don't leave.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.679
Here.

00:16:30.679 --> 00:16:32.179
Keep this for me.

00:16:32.179 --> 00:16:34.379
This was Father's.

00:16:34.379 --> 00:16:37.179
I'll get it from you.

00:16:37.179 --> 00:16:39.679
I'll get it from you

00:16:39.679 --> 00:16:44.259
when I return.

00:16:44.259 --> 00:16:45.559
Please be here.

00:16:45.559 --> 00:18:24.980
Mac, if we delay any longer, we may be trapped.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:28.380
Damn, what if the end doesn't come right away?

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.380
You mean what if Jesus was wrong?

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:31.980
We have a lot to lose.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.480
Abit Hall, the house is locked, and I have the key.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:36.380
Let me see it.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:40.779
Let me see the key or I won't sleep tonight.

00:18:40.779 --> 00:18:47.349
Stop worrying.

00:18:47.349 --> 00:18:49.849
I can't believe you left Gideon in charge.

00:18:49.849 --> 00:18:51.250
He's not even a brother.

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:52.349
Who else is there?

00:18:52.349 --> 00:18:55.809
The brothers have all left.

00:18:55.809 --> 00:18:59.109
Still, I don't trust him.

00:18:59.109 --> 00:19:04.339
He's worked for us for years, and he knows the business.

00:19:04.339 --> 00:19:06.339
Where do you think you're going?

00:19:06.339 --> 00:19:09.039
I'm Neum, the wine merchant.

00:19:09.039 --> 00:19:12.039
My wife and I are leaving to visit friends in the north.

00:19:12.039 --> 00:19:14.140
Are you feeding and clothing his family, too?

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.339
What's all of this?

00:19:16.339 --> 00:19:17.940
You know how it is with women.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.140
They don't know how to travel lights.

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:19.839
Why?

00:19:19.839 --> 00:19:21.339
You're a Roman sympathizer.

00:19:21.339 --> 00:19:23.140
They've left, and you want to leave with them.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:23.940
That's not true.

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:24.539
It's rare.

00:19:24.539 --> 00:19:26.940
I'm a God-fearing man.

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.339
Please just let us pass.

00:19:29.339 --> 00:19:33.440
At the time we need men most, you want to leave.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.240
Wait.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.339
Maybe he's a Christian.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.140
Honest day.

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:39.039
Fight for the nations.

00:19:39.039 --> 00:19:40.640
I'll deal with him.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.240
Please let us pass.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.109
Here, let me give you something.

00:19:45.109 --> 00:19:46.109
A little red wine.

00:19:46.109 --> 00:19:47.410
It's the best in Jerusalem.

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:48.309
bribery.

00:19:48.309 --> 00:19:52.940
You disgust me, sir.

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:54.039
Let them go.

00:19:54.039 --> 00:19:55.539
Christians are of no use to us.

00:19:55.539 --> 00:19:56.539
Thank you.

00:19:56.539 --> 00:19:57.640
Bless you, sir.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.640
Take the donkeys.

00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.640
What?

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.640
Let's serve them.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.240
Let's serve.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:08.640
The beast stays.

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.640
And if you ever come back,

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:15.039
not even your savior will be able to help you.

00:20:15.039 --> 00:20:17.740
I promise you that.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:18.640
Get him out of here.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:55.200
I mean, look at us.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.400
We're out in the wilderness.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.900
Completely defenseless.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.700
Jehovah has never failed us.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.099
He got us out of Jerusalem.

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:09.789
He'll care for us now.

00:21:09.789 --> 00:21:13.359
If only I had your faith.

00:21:13.359 --> 00:21:14.660
You do have faith.

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:21.089
You proved that when you left your old life behind.

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:23.390
I never thought I'd live to actually see it.

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:26.490
But you didn't allow that to cloud your judgment.

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:34.839
You've done the right thing.

00:21:34.839 --> 00:21:39.740
How long do you think we should wait for Neham and Abathol?

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:43.440
They must have left by now.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.339
If they don't show up by dawn,

00:21:45.339 --> 00:21:46.839
we'll go back and look for them.

00:21:46.839 --> 00:21:50.039
I can't figure out what's taking them so long.

00:21:50.039 --> 00:21:53.440
They had a donkey to carry all their stuff for them.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.440
I wonder if that was wise.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.039
The man on the housetop should not come down

00:21:59.039 --> 00:22:07.299
to take the goods out of his house.

00:22:07.299 --> 00:22:10.400
Ethan, you look tired.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:14.099
Why don't you get some rest and I'll keep watch for a while?

00:22:14.099 --> 00:22:52.369
Maybe I'll do that.

00:22:52.369 --> 00:22:54.569
Ethan, Ethan, wake up.

00:22:54.569 --> 00:23:04.809
Somebody's coming.

00:23:04.809 --> 00:23:06.609
Cheb you?

00:23:06.609 --> 00:23:08.210
Cheb you, is that you?

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:11.549
Neham?

00:23:11.549 --> 00:23:12.150
Neham?

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:15.150
Oh, I am so glad to see you.

00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:16.549
What happened?

00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:18.549
At the gate.

00:23:18.549 --> 00:23:20.150
At swords.

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:21.150
There's nothing we could do.

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:22.049
We robbed.

00:23:22.049 --> 00:23:24.250
They stole everything we owned.

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:26.450
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:27.450
I'm so terrible.

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:31.000
Can't believe that happened.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.500
We weren't given enough time to think this through.

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:35.799
Now look what's happened.

00:23:35.799 --> 00:23:40.000
Neham, I'm really sorry about what happened to you.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
But we've all left things behind.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.799
Jesus told us to flee the city.

00:23:44.799 --> 00:23:46.299
And that's exactly what we've done.

00:23:46.299 --> 00:23:47.700
Maybe so.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:49.700
But I still think we should have waited

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.200
until things settled down a little.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.700
Listen, it's late.

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.200
Tomorrow's another long day.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:03.140
Let's get some rest.

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:31.609
Exhausted.

00:24:31.609 --> 00:24:33.609
He's something about this, doesn't add up.

00:24:33.609 --> 00:24:34.609
What do you mean?

00:24:34.609 --> 00:24:36.509
Think about it.

00:24:36.509 --> 00:24:40.210
Jerusalem's to fall by the sword after we leave, right?

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:40.809
Right.

00:24:40.809 --> 00:24:44.210
And Jesus said it would be like when lot left Sodom.

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:46.210
Fire came down from heaven suddenly.

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:48.410
That very day, right?

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:49.410
Yeah.

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:49.910
OK.

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:51.210
So what are you thinking?

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:54.009
The Roman army left Jerusalem.

00:24:54.009 --> 00:24:57.210
If they're retreating, they can't destroy the city.

00:24:57.210 --> 00:25:00.910
Unless it's not really a retreat.

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:02.309
It's a trick.

00:25:02.309 --> 00:25:05.109
They're trying to draw the Jewish fighters out of the city

00:25:05.109 --> 00:25:07.309
and into a trap.

00:25:07.309 --> 00:25:09.710
Why else would they just leave?

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:11.910
They're waiting in ambush.

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:14.009
Ready to pounce.

00:25:14.009 --> 00:25:19.799
Maybe that's why Jesus told us to leave immediately.

00:25:19.799 --> 00:25:25.059
Ethan, what do you think?

00:25:25.059 --> 00:25:27.660
I think we've done just what Jesus commanded us to do.

00:25:29.359 --> 00:25:31.660
Isn't that the important thing, Neym?

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:48.460
I sympathized with Neym.

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:49.960
But there were just so many things

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:55.099
we didn't understand at the time.

00:25:55.099 --> 00:25:57.900
And when word spread about the defeat of the Roman army

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:02.000
and the hands of the Jewish rebels at Bethlehem,

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:15.380
it only raised more questions in our decision.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:19.579
So we began a new life in Pella.

00:26:19.579 --> 00:26:22.380
Welcome, brothers and sisters from Jerusalem.

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:50.880
How was your journey?

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:58.480
Admittedly, life was simpler

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:08.720
and harder than it was in Jerusalem.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:26.750
We had some adjustments to make.

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:57.859
Adjustments that would truly challenge our faith.

00:27:57.859 --> 00:27:59.059
That's it.

00:27:59.059 --> 00:28:00.259
That's all that's left now.

00:28:00.259 --> 00:28:01.259
I'm supposed to work out here

00:28:01.259 --> 00:28:02.960
in the blazing sun all day

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.829
on this pitiful bit of bird scene.

00:28:06.829 --> 00:28:09.029
Avatar, wait.

00:28:09.029 --> 00:28:14.720
Avatar, I'm sorry.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:46.769
Has such a gift for music.

00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:59.430
Anyone here that can teach you?

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:07.119
No, not really.

00:29:07.119 --> 00:29:15.539
It would be a sin to waste that talent.

00:29:15.539 --> 00:29:45.529
Of course, all the best teachers are in Jerusalem.

00:29:45.529 --> 00:29:50.130
This, this is your best outer garment, Neym.

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:52.230
There's not enough there for a new one.

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:55.609
Not if you want to eat tomorrow.

00:29:55.609 --> 00:30:01.700
What more can I do?

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.400
We're out of money.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.400
I'm sick and tired of this place.

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.500
I can't stay here, Neym.

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:08.599
I know.

00:30:08.599 --> 00:30:15.500
I'm not comfortable living with Gentiles.

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:18.000
Even the brothers?

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.900
I don't trust them.

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:27.380
Believe me, I understand.

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:28.880
If I could just make a decent living

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.480
in this good for nothing, place.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:34.480
Or get back to my business in Jerusalem.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:31:08.650
Oh, and everything we swear to ever coming back.

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:10.849
A brother from the North has sent a supply of grain

00:31:10.849 --> 00:31:16.210
as a gift to our congregation.

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:17.710
We've divided it up proportionally

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:22.430
according to the size of each family.

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:24.829
Once again,

00:31:24.829 --> 00:32:08.029
Jehovah has provided for us in our time of need.

00:32:08.029 --> 00:32:12.099
Still, this isn't going to last long.

00:32:12.099 --> 00:32:20.500
Where's your faith, Neym?

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:23.200
Jehovah has cared for us up till now.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:29.319
He'll continue to do so.

00:32:29.319 --> 00:32:34.680
I hear there's plenty of food back in Jerusalem.

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:37.079
Your heart never left it, did it, my brother.

00:32:37.079 --> 00:32:39.579
Jerusalem is my home.

00:32:39.579 --> 00:32:42.880
I was born there.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:48.339
And someday, I'll return.

00:32:48.339 --> 00:32:51.240
I left Jerusalem with a heavy heart, too.

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:53.740
But this is our home now.

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:58.539
There's no reason to believe we'll ever go back to Jerusalem.

00:32:58.539 --> 00:33:00.339
Think, Neym.

00:33:00.339 --> 00:33:02.640
Why did Jesus tell us to flee the city?

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:06.039
Because it was supposed to be destroyed.

00:33:06.039 --> 00:33:08.039
Neym, as we speak,

00:33:08.039 --> 00:33:12.640
60,000 Roman soldiers are attacking the cities of Galilee.

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:15.839
Do you really think they'll spare Jerusalem?

00:33:15.839 --> 00:33:18.039
Maybe they won't.

00:33:18.039 --> 00:33:20.539
But maybe they will.

00:33:20.539 --> 00:33:23.039
It's been a year now.

00:33:23.039 --> 00:33:25.039
I don't want to spend the rest of my life here

00:33:25.039 --> 00:33:27.039
if nothing's happening back in Jerusalem.

00:33:27.039 --> 00:33:32.039
It doesn't really matter when or how the in comes.

00:33:32.039 --> 00:33:34.539
What matters is that we're faithful to Jesus.

00:33:34.539 --> 00:33:35.539
That's amazing.

00:33:35.539 --> 00:33:37.039
That's easy for you to say, Ethan.

00:33:37.039 --> 00:33:39.539
You only have yourself to care for.

00:33:39.539 --> 00:33:43.039
What about those of us with wives and children

00:33:43.039 --> 00:33:45.039
and businesses back in Jerusalem?

00:33:45.039 --> 00:33:47.039
We've all made sacrifices.

00:33:47.039 --> 00:33:49.539
Think about Abraham and Sarah.

00:33:49.539 --> 00:33:52.539
They left a wealthy city to live in tents.

00:33:52.539 --> 00:33:57.420
They never went back there.

00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:59.420
Jehovah blessed them.

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:02.420
He's blessing us, too.

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:05.420
You call this a blessing?

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:07.920
Yes, I do.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:11.420
You've become blind to the blessings right in front of you

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:15.420
because your eyes are glued to the past.

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:18.420
Everything Jesus said about Jerusalem

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:22.420
will come true in God's due time.

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:26.920
Until then, focus on the work He's given us to do.

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:31.980
People think we're fools

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:34.980
because we preach about a destruction that hasn't come.

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:39.699
Because we ran away from our homes.

00:34:39.699 --> 00:34:42.699
People thought Jesus was a fool, too.

00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:46.699
But remember, no one has given up anything

00:34:46.699 --> 00:34:48.699
for the sake of the kingdom

00:34:48.699 --> 00:34:53.699
who will not get 100 fold now and everlasting life.

00:34:53.699 --> 00:35:01.920
Just be glad when all of this is behind us.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:05.809
These are stressful times.

00:35:05.809 --> 00:35:11.119
So what will guide your actions now?

00:35:11.119 --> 00:35:19.110
Nam, let it be faith

00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:22.110
that motivates everything you do.

00:35:22.110 --> 00:36:03.550
Still, Nam struggle to overcome his doubts

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:06.900
about leaving Jerusalem.

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:09.900
Telling you, Ethan had a sweet Jerusalem too early.

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:11.900
Gideons out there making money and work here.

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:13.900
As time wore on,

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.900
they remain the burning question

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:18.900
that Nam just couldn't get past.

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:21.900
So tell me this, why hasn't the end come?

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:24.900
Nam, how long are you going to keep asking that question?

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:27.900
I didn't have the answers.

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.900
But I knew that if we kept focused

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:33.900
on the more important things

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:36.900
and patiently waited on Jehovah,

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:39.900
it would all become clear for us

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:41.900
to keep cultivating contentment

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:43.900
with the circumstances we do have.

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:49.360
Nam imagined that life back in Jerusalem

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.360
was just the same as always,

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:54.360
but the reality is quite different.

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.360
Shortly after we left,

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:01.360
the cold hand of Salatry plunged the city

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:04.360
into a brutal and senseless civil war.

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:34.309
God acts as a Roman general better than I can do.

00:37:34.309 --> 00:37:39.309
Our enemies are destroying one another with their own name.

00:37:39.309 --> 00:37:55.179
Medical scene in Rome descended into anarchy

00:37:55.179 --> 00:37:57.179
when a military coup

00:37:57.179 --> 00:38:00.179
and a death sentence issued by the Senate

00:38:00.179 --> 00:38:24.460
drove Emperor Nero to suicide.

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:26.460
Those chaotic events

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:28.460
made walking by faith

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:30.460
even more important

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:36.579
and even more.

00:38:36.579 --> 00:39:06.420
Shabu, I've made up my mind

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:09.599
returning to Jerusalem.

00:39:09.599 --> 00:39:14.449
Nam,

00:39:14.449 --> 00:39:17.449
we have been over this before.

00:39:17.449 --> 00:39:20.449
Rome has been in chaos for a year and a half

00:39:20.449 --> 00:39:22.449
ever since Nero's suicide.

00:39:22.449 --> 00:39:25.449
What does that have to do with us?

00:39:25.449 --> 00:39:28.449
The Roman army never returned.

00:39:28.449 --> 00:39:30.449
Don't you see?

00:39:30.449 --> 00:39:33.449
Jehovah has delivered the Holy City again.

00:39:33.449 --> 00:39:36.449
Now is the time, Shabu.

00:39:36.449 --> 00:39:38.449
The time for what?

00:39:38.449 --> 00:39:39.449
The time to go back.

00:39:39.449 --> 00:39:41.449
What are you talking about?

00:39:42.449 --> 00:39:45.449
We've slaved away here for four years now.

00:39:45.449 --> 00:39:48.449
What do we have to show for it?

00:39:48.449 --> 00:39:50.449
Our lives.

00:39:50.449 --> 00:39:53.449
Our lives are back in Jerusalem.

00:39:53.449 --> 00:39:56.820
I just want to take care of my family

00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:59.820
and I can't do that here.

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:06.530
We're getting by.

00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:09.530
We can do better than just get by.

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:12.530
We don't have to say another minute in this dump, Shabu.

00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:14.530
But we have to act quickly.

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:18.530
Rachel and I have discussed this at length.

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:20.530
The answer is no.

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:23.530
Now please get off my plans.

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:25.530
That's Ethan talking.

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:27.530
Don't base your decisions on his opinions.

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:29.530
How about Jesus' words?

00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:31.530
We did what Jesus told us to do.

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:32.530
We got out.

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:35.530
But he never said that we couldn't return.

00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:37.530
Besides, what happened to Jerusalem?

00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:38.530
Nothing.

00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:40.530
Yet.

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:43.530
Why wouldn't Jehovah have mercy on Jerusalem, Shabu?

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:46.530
He's the home to the temple and to his people.

00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:48.530
He changed his mind with Nineveh.

00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:49.530
And that was a pagan scene.

00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:51.530
Nineveh's repented.

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:53.530
And do you know that Jews are no longer God's people?

00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:56.530
It's obvious that Jehovah has protected Jerusalem.

00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:58.530
Not just once, but twice.

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:01.530
First with the route of Sestius Galus.

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:04.530
And now, with all the political confusion in Rome,

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:06.530
Jerusalem's orbit forgot.

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:09.530
What makes you assume those events proved Jehovah's protection over Jerusalem?

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:12.530
When Jesus said, it'll be destroyed.

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:14.530
Shabu.

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:19.530
Okay, let's assume that Jehovah still intends to destroy Jerusalem.

00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:23.530
We all thought that it was going to happen as soon as we left.

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:24.530
But it didn't.

00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:25.530
Did it.

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:29.130
We were wrong about that.

00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:31.130
So when will it happen?

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:36.130
Man, you know it's impossible to know the day or the hour.

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:38.130
Just hear me out.

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:40.130
Come here, Shabu.

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:44.130
Jehovah foretold the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians, right?

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:45.130
Yeah.

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:47.130
By what prophets?

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:49.130
By several.

00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:52.130
Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel.

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:54.130
Am I right?

00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:55.130
Yeah, you're right.

00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:56.130
So what?

00:41:56.130 --> 00:42:00.130
How many years in advance did he foretell that destruction?

00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:03.130
I don't remember a few hundred anyway.

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:04.130
What's your point?

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:06.130
A few hundred years, Shabu.

00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:08.130
That's the point.

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:11.130
Shabu, Jehovah is patient.

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:17.659
If he waited hundreds of years then, why would he rush into action now?

00:42:17.659 --> 00:42:19.659
I don't know, name.

00:42:19.659 --> 00:42:22.659
But you've heard the reports about what's happening in Jerusalem.

00:42:22.659 --> 00:42:24.659
Factions fighting for control.

00:42:24.659 --> 00:42:25.659
Violence.

00:42:25.659 --> 00:42:26.659
Bloodshed.

00:42:26.659 --> 00:42:27.659
Anarchy.

00:42:27.659 --> 00:42:28.659
Stories.

00:42:28.659 --> 00:42:32.659
Embellished and exaggerated with every telling.

00:42:32.659 --> 00:42:34.659
Every city has its problems.

00:42:34.659 --> 00:42:35.659
Jerusalem's no difference.

00:42:35.659 --> 00:42:40.659
Still thousands of families march in and out of Jerusalem three times every year.

00:42:40.659 --> 00:42:43.659
They come and they go.

00:42:43.659 --> 00:42:45.659
Nothing happens.

00:42:45.659 --> 00:42:47.659
Why can't we?

00:42:47.659 --> 00:42:49.659
Just to check on things.

00:42:49.659 --> 00:42:51.659
Name.

00:42:51.659 --> 00:42:53.659
My friend.

00:42:53.659 --> 00:42:57.659
We have thought and prayed about this for a long time.

00:42:57.659 --> 00:42:59.659
And it comes down to this.

00:42:59.659 --> 00:43:04.659
Either we obey a clear command from Jesus or we don't.

00:43:05.659 --> 00:43:07.659
Jesus told us to leave Jerusalem.

00:43:07.659 --> 00:43:09.659
Never indicating we should return.

00:43:09.659 --> 00:43:12.659
Not even for a day.

00:43:12.659 --> 00:43:14.659
We must be obedient.

00:43:14.659 --> 00:43:23.000
We're going anyway.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.000
Rachel.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.000
Think of barrage.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000
Come with us.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
You could find him.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.000
And that boy of yours?

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000
What kind of life is this?

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:40.079
We have been friends our whole lives.

00:43:40.079 --> 00:43:41.079
We've been through a lot together.

00:43:41.079 --> 00:43:43.079
And I have always been honest with you, name.

00:43:43.079 --> 00:43:45.079
Now I'm telling you, you're wrong.

00:43:45.079 --> 00:43:47.079
How can you know that?

00:43:47.079 --> 00:43:49.079
I'm willing to die for you.

00:43:49.079 --> 00:43:52.079
But I will not throw away my life by going back to Jerusalem.

00:43:52.079 --> 00:43:54.079
Throw away your life.

00:43:54.079 --> 00:43:56.079
You threw away your life when you came here.

00:43:56.079 --> 00:43:57.079
Name.

00:43:57.079 --> 00:44:02.079
You're still so focused on the past that you can't see the blessings right in front of your eyes.

00:44:02.079 --> 00:44:05.079
We're going today.

00:44:05.079 --> 00:44:07.079
My brother, I beg you.

00:44:07.079 --> 00:44:09.079
Don't go.

00:44:09.079 --> 00:44:10.079
Name.

00:44:10.079 --> 00:44:13.079
What are you returning to?

00:44:13.079 --> 00:44:14.079
To what is mine?

00:44:14.079 --> 00:44:38.510
We have it, please.

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:41.780
There you do it.

00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:53.090
My dear sister, I am sorry it took so long to reply to your letters.

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:56.090
But the situation in Jerusalem is desperate.

00:44:56.090 --> 00:45:25.349
It's good that you are not here to see what has become of our beautiful city.

00:45:25.349 --> 00:46:00.440
Jerusalem is like a ravenous beast that feeds on its own flesh,

00:46:32.699 --> 00:47:01.199
sheds, fight on another dogs, priest, pepperous slaughtered at the temple.

00:47:01.199 --> 00:47:18.059
Sprinkling the altar, there is starvation in the city,

00:47:18.059 --> 00:47:26.699
two all the food reserves were destroyed.

00:47:26.699 --> 00:47:29.699
Adam the jealousy of the political factions,

00:47:29.699 --> 00:47:50.820
tens of thousands from the countryside say that the Roman army is burning,

00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:55.820
Luting it, killing its way back into Jerusalem.

00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:58.820
By now, there are only a few days away.

00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:51.019
Be wise or still.

00:48:51.019 --> 00:49:00.070
Not to attempt to return.

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:01.070
You and Shepard.

00:49:01.070 --> 00:50:23.550
Looking back on those events,

00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:27.550
fills me with both joy and sadness.

00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:32.829
Joy, because we made the right decision.

00:50:32.829 --> 00:50:35.829
But sadness, when I think of the consequences,

00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:42.750
when material things become the motivating force behind decisions.

00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:49.750
Now more than ever, I realize that true Christianity requires strong faith.

00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:52.750
Faith to walk a narrow and cramped road,

00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:56.750
even when we can't see what's around the next bend.

00:50:56.750 --> 00:51:01.750
Faith to make decisions that defy conventional wisdom.

00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:05.750
And faith to stick by those decisions.

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:16.289
Here in Pella, we don't have all the things we had in Jerusalem.

00:51:16.289 --> 00:51:20.860
And life is much harder.

00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:22.860
But what's really important,

00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:26.860
is that my family and I remained loyal to Jehovah,

00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:29.860
and survived the last days of Jerusalem.

00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:36.349
I don't know what the future holds,

00:51:36.349 --> 00:51:38.349
but we're determined,

00:51:38.349 --> 00:51:40.349
come what may,

00:51:40.349 --> 00:51:44.349
to keep walking by faith.
