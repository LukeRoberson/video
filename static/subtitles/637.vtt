00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:08.289
This morning, we'll consider the theme, consider our sympathetic high priest.

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:14.529
This verse from Matthew 1220 is a messianic prophecy from Isaiah.

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:18.010
It's from Isaiah 42 and verse 3.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.769
And we're going to consider three questions.

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:27.370
First of all, what images are conveyed by a bruised reed and a smoldering wick, and

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.170
our commenters already gave us a good idea.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.570
Second, how did fulfilling this prophecy show what a sympathetic high priest Jesus is?

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.530
And third, how are God's people following His lead today?

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.929
So first of all, what images are conveyed by a bruised reed and a smoldering wick?

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:54.210
In the Hebrew scriptures, prosperous, strong people were likened to beautiful flowers

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.649
or to large, stately trees.

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:05.329
But Isaiah did not use such an image here, rather he refers to a bruised reed, like a large

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:11.650
stalk of grass that was bent over and in danger of being crushed or trampled.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.890
In fact, Isaiah used this image in 36.6.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.450
It actually was a disparaging idiom for weakness.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.049
And likewise, Isaiah did not refer to shining heavenly luminaries used to represent powerful

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.290
people and nations.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:38.370
Instead, he used the image of a smoldering wick, like those used in common household lamps.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:45.769
A dim smoldering wick was often due to lack of attention or to a low oil supply.

00:01:45.769 --> 00:01:51.010
And eventually, the flame would die out like the lamp on the right.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.290
Broken reeds were considered worthless.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.849
And smoldering wicks, as we already heard, produced dim light and sometimes irritating smoke

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:03.530
before they were finally extinguished.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.370
So these images represent common, lowly people who felt crushed and broken and who reviewed

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.409
as insignificant.

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:19.650
So how does this prophecy show what a sympathetic, high priest Jesus is?

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.729
Matthew quoted this verse after Jesus had miraculously cured a number of people.

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:31.250
And some of his most touching miracles were for downtrodden persons who must have felt like

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.129
a dying wick.

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:40.530
For example, the man who was full of leprosy who came to him begging on bended knee.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.610
Or the death man that Jesus took aside privately, perhaps because of his insecurities.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.689
Or the trembling woman with a flow of blood who spent all her money for a cure but just

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:55.650
kept getting worse.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.650
Now their rabbis taught them there is no suffering without iniquity.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.729
In other words, somehow they were responsible for their physical condition because of having

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:07.729
sinned.

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:14.129
And that must have made them feel even more worthless, like bruised reeds and like smoldering

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:15.770
wicks.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.129
And their priests had no interest in teaching them anything.

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:27.610
They said this crowd, including such people that does not know the law, are accursed people.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:34.490
By contrast, notice what the study note on Matthew chapter 12 and verse 20 says.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:41.930
The prophecy of Isaiah 42-3 foretold Jesus' compassion, he would never extinguish the

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.289
last spark of hope in humble and downtrodden people.

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:53.650
Yes, Jesus cured these people physically, but he also rekindled their hope.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.930
And Jesus' mercy and sympathy are among his qualifications as high priest.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.689
Hebrews 2.17 said that he had to become like his brothers in all respects so that he could

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:10.849
become a merciful and faithful high priest.

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:16.769
And when we think about it, some of those that he cured became his brothers.

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.569
And notice how his sympathy toward them is highlighted in this verse in Hebrews 4 and

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:24.970
verse 15.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.610
For now we'll just read the first part of the verse.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:37.170
For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.649
Now here Paul uses a double negative.

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:45.370
We do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:53.810
This is a Greek way of emphatically saying our high priest fully sympathizes with our weaknesses.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.129
And a Bible dictionary says about the term sympathize that it describes a person who

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:06.009
is affected like another by the same sufferings, impressions, and emotions.

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:09.209
One who has fellow feeling.

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:15.889
Now Jesus acquired this sympathy for his brothers by seeing them up close.

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:22.250
Jesus didn't have leprosy, but fellow feeling impelled him to reach out and touch the

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.170
leprosy.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:30.129
He was not deaf or mute, but he put his fingers in the ears of the deaf man and touched

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:32.129
his tongue.

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:37.709
He committed no sin, but he strongly defended the woman, the repentant woman, as she

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:43.149
washed his feet with her tears and dried them with her hair.

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:47.709
He wasn't repelled by human weakness and infirmity.

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:54.389
He sympathetically welcomed and reassured such people, and he set a pattern for his disciples

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:58.949
then and also a pattern for us today.

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:05.670
So the third question is how are God's people following His lead today?

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:10.790
While using His faithful slave, our high priest is figuratively opening wide the gates

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.509
of the great spiritual temple.

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:19.870
He invites all people, people of all sorts, to worship the Father, including those who

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.629
are often overlooked or marginalized by those around them.

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:32.670
For example, Jehovah's people produce publications in 105 sign languages.

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.629
All publications for the blind are available in 54 languages.

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:43.769
And audio descriptions for our videos are in 92 languages, and these also benefit the

00:06:43.769 --> 00:06:45.529
blind.

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:51.110
And just as Jesus healed individuals, some of these publications in certain languages

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:57.069
are provided to give a very small number of people hope for the future to rekindle

00:06:57.069 --> 00:06:59.550
their flame.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:04.550
So like the lepers in Jesus' day, there are whole groups of people who are looked down

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:09.790
on and discriminated against within their own communities.

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:16.670
For example, on the left, the Romany people have long been misunderstood and mistreated.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:22.589
The Nazis attempted genocide against them in Europe, and they still face much prejudice.

00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:27.269
But they're welcomed in the congregations of Jehovah's people as we see in the picture

00:07:27.269 --> 00:07:28.910
on the left.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:34.470
And we have translated publications in more than 25 Romany languages.

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:40.149
And we see those Romany children studying publications in their language.

00:07:40.149 --> 00:07:44.750
And thousands of them are now our brothers and sisters.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:52.230
We've also produced publications in 160 languages in Amerindian languages of South, Central,

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.550
and North America.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:08:00.310
More Indians are often poorer and marginalized in their own native lands, but many thousands

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:03.870
have responded to the good news.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:11.790
And on the right, in India and South Asia, Dalit denotes one who is oppressed or crushed.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:18.029
The Dalit people were previously known by the dehumanizing term untouchables.

00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:24.149
And this population of well over 200 million is considered to be at the lowest level of

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:27.189
the Hindu caste system.

00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:32.029
Even though laws prohibit discrimination against them, they're often treated like lepers

00:08:32.029 --> 00:08:34.750
or treated in Jesus' day.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.950
Many shun them and refuse to eat with or even near them.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:44.549
But our brothers are welcoming a growing number of Dalits into the congregations.

00:08:44.549 --> 00:08:50.110
They're imitating their high priest by welcoming those whose background could make them feel

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:55.590
like a crushed, reed or a smoldering wick.

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:58.070
But what about us as individuals?

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:05.590
At times, as our commenters mentioned, circumstances in life could make us feel that the flame of hope

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:12.429
that we once had and was once bright as being extinguished could be due to a personal failure,

00:09:12.429 --> 00:09:19.669
a health issue, or a damaged relationship with a family member or a member of the congregation.

00:09:19.669 --> 00:09:25.509
We may struggle to look beyond the present pain and focus on our hope.

00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:30.870
But remember that our high priest, just as he saw those individual situations in his

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:35.350
day, he sees our individual situation.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:41.649
Jehovah has empowered him to distribute Holy Spirit and also to use gifts in men in

00:09:41.649 --> 00:09:47.509
the congregation to rekindle our spirit and to help us stand upright again.
