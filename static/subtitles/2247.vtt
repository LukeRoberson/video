00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.019
Everyone likes to win, but can you win if you're always honest?

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.809
Nobody likes a cheater.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.370
But sometimes it can seem like Dishonesty works.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.980
So why should you be the only one not to do it?

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.539
Especially if no one gets hurt.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.940
The problem is

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.780
Dishonesty costs more than it pays.

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:41.179
And once you start going down the path of Dishonesty,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.460
it's really hard to stop.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.299
If a lie seems to succeed,

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:48.700
your next one is often right around the corner.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:55.539
You might think it's not that bad to tell just part of the truth.

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:05.750
But it's a lie if it misleads those who deserve to know the full story.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.849
And what's wrong with exaggerating a little?

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:13.849
To make friends.

00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:26.689
Appearing to be someone you're not is just another kind of lie.

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:33.230
As you keep going,

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.230
it all seems okay.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.230
Until you find there's a totally different version of you.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.230
And he's taking over.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.230
Lies never let you rest.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.739
Keeping track of them is harder than just remembering the truth.

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:50.739
Sooner or later,

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:53.739
you'll face the real cost of Dishonesty.

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:55.739
The Bible says in Proverbs 21-6

00:01:55.739 --> 00:02:01.390
that any benefit we get from lying

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.390
is like a vanishing mist.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.390
You can't even imagine

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.390
a vanishing mist.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.500
You could lose your family's trust and respect.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.500
You could lose your friends.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.330
And a lifetime of Dishonesty

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.330
can have bigger consequences.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.330
On top of all that,

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.330
Dishonesty has a hidden cost.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.330
It changes how you feel about yourself.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.330
But you can choose to be honest.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.330
And see for yourself how it pays.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.330
When you're tempted to take the easy Dishonest way out,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.639
say no.

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:45.639
The results of your hard work

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:49.460
will be truly yours.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.460
Earn your family's trust and respect with the whole truth.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.460
There may be consequences,

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.460
but you can learn from your mistakes.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.460
And make friends with those who like you for who you really are.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.460
Being honest pays in ways Dishonesty never will.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.460
In your family,

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.460
with your friends,

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.460
and with yourself.
