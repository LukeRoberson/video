00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:08.230
The theme selected for my comments this month is punctuality, a godly quality.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:14.109
You might remember the opening paragraph and a 1990 watchtower article on the subject

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:15.109
of punctuality.

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:21.670
It said that an elder's closest friends jokingly called him Armageddon.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.670
Why?

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.070
They replied, we know he's coming, but only God knows when.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.750
The elder had a problem with punctuality.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.630
Punctuality has nothing in common with procrastination.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:42.070
To procrastinate means to intentionally put off the doing of something that should be

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.149
done.

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:51.670
The saying, tomorrow is the busiest day of the year reflects the human tendency to procrastinate.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.469
How appropriate then is the inspired encouragement concerning the present today.

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:06.269
Galatian 610 says, as long as we have the opportunity, let us work what is good toward all.

00:01:06.269 --> 00:01:11.790
As long as we have the opportunity does not sound like procrastination to me.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.269
Know the Bible encourages just the opposite, punctuality.

00:01:17.269 --> 00:01:22.909
Punctuality refers to the characteristic of being prompt in keeping appointments.

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.069
Punctuality is a godly quality.

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:32.750
In fact, Matthew 633 prioritizes our pursuit of kingdom interest.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:39.030
It says, keep on then seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.829
things will be added to you.

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:50.750
It said to seek the kingdom first, not second, not third or fourth, first.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:58.189
When we put the kingdom first in our life, we do not put it off in favor of some trivial

00:01:58.189 --> 00:01:59.189
pursuit.

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.670
If it is time for a Christian meeting, we are there.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:12.509
Well before it starts, perhaps you have heard some say, at least I made it to the meeting.

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:14.870
Better late than never.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.830
But the godly way is better than ever late.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.030
Jehovah is a punctual god.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.389
He sets the example for us.

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:30.009
When Jehovah decided to destroy the ungodly world in a deluge, he said to Noah, Genesis

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:35.750
chapter 6 verse 14, make for yourself an art.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:42.710
Then at Genesis 7-4, Jehovah told Noah to enter into the ark and informed him for in

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.949
just seven days.

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:49.870
I will make it rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.349
What happened?

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.110
A better late than ever?

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.110
Attitude?

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.110
No.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.509
That is not acceptable to Jehovah.

00:02:57.509 --> 00:03:05.270
Instead Genesis chapter 7 verse 10 says, and seven days later, the flood waters came up

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.270
on the earth.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.789
Right on time, punctuality is a godly quality.

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:17.629
By means of a prophecy in Daniel chapter 9, Jehovah indicated hundreds of years in

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:23.310
advance when Jesus would fulfill his role as Messiah and Savior.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.669
When did Jesus present himself for that role?

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.590
Better late than ever?

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.590
No.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.750
Precisely on time.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.509
In 29 CE, Jesus was anointed as Christ.

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:45.830
In fact, Romans chapter 5 verse 6 says, Christ died for ungodly men at the appointed time.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.389
Jehovah is punctual.

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.110
What about in our time?

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.750
The Bible tells us to keep in expectation of Jehovah's future day of judgment.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.509
When will it happen?

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:05.229
Well, to us it may seem that it has delayed, but what do we know about Jehovah?

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:14.469
He is punctual, and so it is that Habakkuk chapter 2 verse 3 tells us, for the vision is yet

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:23.029
for its appointed time, and it is rushing toward its end, and it will not lie.

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:30.149
Even if it should delay, keep in expectation of it, for it will without fail come true.

00:04:30.149 --> 00:04:34.029
It will not be late.

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:36.350
This is Jehovah's way.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:42.389
Unlike the elders cited earlier, this Armageddon will be on time.

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:48.949
The Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians chapter 14 was specifically discussing what happens

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:50.990
at Christian gatherings.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:58.949
In verse 26 he said, when you come together, let all things take place for building up.

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:06.310
In 1 Corinthians chapter 14, verse 40, he concludes by saying, but let all things take

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.910
place decently and by arrangement.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.110
Look at the words again.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.949
When speaking about Christian meetings, he said, let things take place decently.

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:21.350
In Greek it literally means, well, behaviorly.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.430
Paul also used a Greek word translated here by arrangement.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.149
The literal meaning of the Greek word is according to order.

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:38.230
If we are to be well behaved according to order, at our meeting, what would be one aspect

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:43.750
of that, being punctual, on time for the start of the meeting.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:49.990
While the lack of punctuality affects all cultures to one degree or another, it is true

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:55.149
that some cultures are more punctual than others as a whole.

00:05:55.189 --> 00:06:01.949
A missionary reported that in one town where he served, his wife would be the only person

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:07.870
in the audience when he announced the opening song at the beginning of the meeting.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:14.029
But when he announced the closing song, 70 people would be there.

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:21.470
On the other hand, in a Western European country, about 1,000 people were asked, if you were

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:30.949
invited to dinner at 7 pm, should you arrive 5 or 10 minutes early, or 5 or 10 minutes late,

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:33.149
or exactly on time?

00:06:33.149 --> 00:06:39.709
The majority responded that courtesy requires scrupulous respect for the host and arriving

00:06:39.709 --> 00:06:43.110
at the exact minute.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.589
Each culture would likely think that the other is extreme.

00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:52.870
However, being punctual is more than a matter of regional preference.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:07:00.350
It is a godly quality that true Christians of every culture want to cultivate.

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:04.230
Punctuality must become a habit, a way of life.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:11.709
It is similar to some countries that do not have a habit of good hygiene or cleanliness.

00:07:11.709 --> 00:07:18.189
It may be true, but it is expected that Jehovah's people in those lands will excel in good

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:21.029
hygiene and clean habits.

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:27.910
In the same way, no matter what our background, culture, or upbringing, it is expected that

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:36.029
we, as imitators of our God, will develop the godly habit of being punctual.

00:07:36.029 --> 00:07:38.509
What helps us to be punctual?

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:41.670
The Bible encourages advanced planning.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:49.470
Proverbs 21 5 says, the plans of the diligent, surely lead to success, but all who are hasty

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:52.709
surely head for poverty.

00:07:52.709 --> 00:08:00.110
So being punctual is not just a matter of hastily fulfilling an obligation or an appointment.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:04.990
It involves thinking in advance about our responsibilities.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:11.709
Yes, planning to be prepared for them and to be prompt in carrying them out.

00:08:11.709 --> 00:08:18.870
Well, what are some activities that we would want to be punctual in fulfilling?

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:26.750
It can be the everyday things in life, such as arriving at work or at school on time,

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:33.029
being punctual for appointments such as a visit to the doctor or dentist, arriving at

00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:38.870
the designated time when invited to another's home for a meal.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:44.029
What is our habit like when it comes to these areas of life?

00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:50.070
Even more important is punctuality when attending our Christian meetings and assemblies.

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:55.629
This means being present before the opening song in prayer.

00:08:55.629 --> 00:09:03.070
The Apostle Paul quoted from Psalm 22 when he wrote Hebrews 2-12 of Jesus.

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:09.830
He said, I will declare your name to my brothers in the midst of the congregation.

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:12.669
I will praise you with song.

00:09:12.669 --> 00:09:20.509
If that was true of Jesus, it is a great incentive for us to participate in singing the first

00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:23.629
song with our congregation.

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:27.110
The opening prayer is important for us.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:33.230
In ancient times, Jehovah called the temple his house a prayer.

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:38.470
It is true that the opening prayer requests Jehovah's guidance and Holy Spirit on the

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:39.470
program.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:48.149
However, it also prepares our minds and hearts to receive the information to be considered.

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:54.870
Of course, there may be times when one is unavoidably late in arriving at a meeting.

00:09:54.870 --> 00:10:00.750
Public transportation may be delayed or our car may break down.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:04.230
That's understandable on occasion.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:07.190
But what is our habit?

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:13.470
In the past, it was suggested that we consider arriving 15 or 20 minutes before a meeting

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:15.230
started.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:21.269
One brother with six siblings said his father made a goal of being at the Kingdom Hall

00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:25.389
20 minutes before the program began.

00:10:25.389 --> 00:10:28.070
That certainly took advance planning.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:36.429
His father's byline for meeting attendance was if you're five minutes early, then you're

00:10:36.429 --> 00:10:39.350
15 minutes late.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:49.110
In most cases, the whole family arrived 20 minutes before the meeting for wholesome association.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:54.870
Another opportunity for punctuality is arriving on time for a meeting for service.

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.029
This is challenging for some.

00:10:57.029 --> 00:11:02.429
However, with a little advance planning, we can be successful.

00:11:02.429 --> 00:11:09.909
It is particularly important since the actual meeting is only about 10 minutes long.

00:11:09.909 --> 00:11:16.110
If we're late, not only is it disruptive, but it could force the one taking the lead

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:21.590
to redo the arrangements made for the group.

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:27.830
And speaking of our ministry, what is an opportunity to be punctual every month?

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:34.190
Yes, you guessed it, turning in our field service report at the end of the month.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:37.950
Do you have a way of reminding yourself of this?

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:45.710
In some lands, it is almost as if it is a custom for the start of a wedding talk to be delayed.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:52.990
Often this is because of mistakenly gauging how much time the bride needs to get dressed

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:56.830
and made up for her grand appearance.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:04.789
However, being considered of those invited should move those involved to allow extra time

00:12:04.789 --> 00:12:08.190
to complete the task of preparation.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:15.110
A 1990 watchtower commented on being punctual and starting a wedding.

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:18.110
The very next sentence stated,

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:24.549
You may like to have your egg boiled for just so many minutes.

00:12:24.549 --> 00:12:32.870
I am not sure exactly how that applies to a wedding, but I think we get to point, don't we?

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:42.950
We should have calculated the timing in advance so that the ceremony begins on time.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:48.830
Do we have yet another example of being punctual, not procrastinating?

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:57.190
How about when there is a difference between you and a fellow believer or a family member?

00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:03.309
Of course, if it is simply a minor issue because of imperfection,

00:13:03.309 --> 00:13:08.950
often the best thing to do is forgive and forget.

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:17.269
But if it was more serious or we cannot simply let it go, what should we do?

00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:21.509
We need to settle the matter and restore the peace.

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:24.230
When should we take this step?

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:31.950
Do not procrastinate if we do the problem may fester and get worse.

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:38.669
What kind of a priority did Jesus establish for restoring peace between fellow believers?

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:46.549
At Matthew 523-24, note his clear indication of punctuality.

00:13:46.549 --> 00:13:54.110
If then you are bringing your gift to the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you,

00:13:54.110 --> 00:14:01.470
leave your gift there in front of the altar and go away first, make your peace with your brother

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:04.509
and then come back and offer your gift.

00:14:04.549 --> 00:14:11.350
Did you pick up on the timing that Jesus recommended for reconciliation?

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:17.909
He said, first, first, make your peace with your brother.

00:14:17.909 --> 00:14:22.350
It is a high priority and should be treated as such.

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:28.110
But remember the scripture we shared earlier, Proverbs 21-5.

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:31.389
This principle should be implemented.

00:14:31.389 --> 00:14:37.350
They last part of the verse warns us not to be hasty.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:42.269
hasty is not synonymous with punctuality.

00:14:42.269 --> 00:14:50.549
Instead, the first part of the verse indicates we should prepare or plan the visit first.

00:14:50.549 --> 00:14:54.149
Then follow through without procrastinating.

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:59.789
It said this approach will lead to success.

00:14:59.789 --> 00:15:03.309
What is the success we are seeking?

00:15:03.309 --> 00:15:13.990
Jesus did not say to justify our position or to point out the flaw in the other person's words or actions.

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:21.669
No, he said you would be successful if you make your peace with your brother.

00:15:21.669 --> 00:15:28.070
Punctuality is a godly quality that we should strive to cultivate.

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:34.110
Another aspect of punctuality is ending an assignment on time.

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:39.309
In the interest of punctuality, let's move on to the next segment of our program.
