00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.450
I always loved music.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.449
I got my first guitar when I was 15,

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:12.449
and since then, it's been my way of expressing myself.

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.890
When they asked,

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.890
Dave, do you want to join the band?

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.890
I didn't have to think twice.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.890
Making music has all that really mattered to me.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.890
I thought, being a musician would make me happy.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.890
So that is the path I followed.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:49.479
Only it is not what I thought it would be.

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:52.479
I worked here during the day to pay the bills.

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:56.479
I thought my life would turn out better,

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:59.479
but something was missing.

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:01.479
Instead of being happy,

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:10.140
I just felt lost.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:20.980
Man, I'm distracted.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:30.530
They are friendly and look happy.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.530
He gave me a tract.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.530
And said,

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.530
many people are searching for true happiness.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.530
Maybe you are one of them.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:51.129
This could help.

00:01:51.129 --> 00:01:54.129
I quickly wrote down my address

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:56.129
and asked,

00:01:56.129 --> 00:01:59.129
whether they would mind passing by after I finished my shift.

00:01:59.129 --> 00:02:07.120
I was searching all right.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.120
Actually,

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.120
the answers were in front of me all along.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:24.340
How come I only get it now?

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.389
You see, I was baptized.

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:39.210
But I never gave the truth a chance.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.210
Roy did come as promised.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:53.360
I told him I'm a baptized brother.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.180
He really listened to me.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.180
Then he shared some hundred verse three.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.180
Know that Jehovah is God.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.180
He is the one who made us.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.180
And we belong to Him.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.180
We are His people.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.180
And the sheep of His pasture.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.180
In the Bible,

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.180
Jehovah is likened to a shepherd.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.180
He knows every single one of His sheep.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.180
And He knows when one goes missing.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.180
A lost sheep is not a lost cause.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.180
It still belongs to Him.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.180
And Jehovah doesn't spare any efforts in searching for it.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.180
Until He finds it.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:42.139
I was like one of those lost sheep.

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:48.340
But I still belong to Jehovah.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:57.189
And He has never forgotten about me.

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:00.189
Roy promised we would keep in touch.

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:13.389
And invited me to the Sunday meeting.

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:15.389
And I was nervous that morning.

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:24.430
I wanted to look my best.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.430
Roy and Matthew were waiting for me.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.430
Giving me a warm welcome.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.430
Something I'll never forget.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.350
How I miss this.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:43.230
This is indeed Jehovah's congregation.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.230
This is where I belong.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:54.540
The truth has never been so clear to me.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:03.779
How I enjoy the close company of my brothers and sisters.

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:15.589
What I enjoy most is helping others to find our loving father, Jehovah.

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:22.279
With Jehovah's help, I will never be lost again.
