00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:20.960
I've been given public talks for decades, and versus 15, and in all that time, I've never had something like this happen.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.960
Thank you.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.989
I'm really, really, really, too.

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:30.989
I hope to see you later.

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.990
If I ain't, yes.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.990
Give a minute.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.990
Yes.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.990
Okay.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.990
Thanks so much for just taking a moment.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.990
I just wanted to bring to your attention.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.990
He counseled me about my teaching.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:57.920
I don't want to ignore his words, but the friends in the congregation love my talks.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.619
I think.

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:03.619
Justice and righteousness.

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:14.500
If you open your Bible in Jeremiah, chapter 22, chapter 22, verses 15 and 16.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:22.260
I'm just not sure how to feel about all of this.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:30.750
We watched a good news according to Jesus again.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.750
This time, I paid special attention to the correction that Sakurai received.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.750
I read the account again, and I noticed he was described as being blameless.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.750
But that did not mean he was above correction.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.750
My brother gave me kind, but direct counsel from God's word.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:04.019
It's a privilege to teach in the congregation, and I want to give my very best to Jehovah.

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:33.479
David, do you have a moment?

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:35.479
Sure.

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:38.479
I wanted to ask you, well, I'm working on a part for next week.

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:42.479
I want to open you, listen to it, and let me know what I can work on.

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:43.479
Of course.

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:44.479
I'll be happy to.

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:46.479
I really appreciate it.

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:50.479
Hey, by the way, will you and your wife still be able to join us for that gathering next week?

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:51.479
Oh, absolutely.

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:53.479
We're really looking forward to it.

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:54.479
See you here.

00:02:54.479 --> 00:03:00.120
All right.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.120
Good night.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.120
My life.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.120
I wanted to be a pioneer.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.120
God has decided to adjust the hour requirements for pioneers.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.120
The requirement will now be 600 hours per year.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.120
That is an average.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:25.979
I was grateful for the adjustment, but I still didn't feel like I had the right circumstances.

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:27.979
Mom, are you okay?

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:29.979
Are you okay?

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:50.740
I was determined to care for Mama, no matter how hard it got at times.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:04:08.960
My aunt and uncle would come by to help so that I could attend the meetings.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:16.750
I'm happy to announce that Sister Chloe O'Malley is now serving as a regular pioneer.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.750
My mother's much younger than me started pioneering.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:26.540
I was happy for them, but I never thought it would happen for me.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:51.370
I took comfort in Elizabeth's example.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:57.370
Life must have been hard for Elizabeth, but she didn't let disappointment to find her.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.370
To hold of you to her as righteous and blameless.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.370
That's how I wanted him to see me too.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.769
I wanted to service with you.

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:10.769
Yeah.

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:11.769
Are you free this Friday?

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:17.769
So I continued to do as much in the ministry as my circumstances allowed.

00:05:17.769 --> 00:05:22.769
I also found joy in helping those who could pioneer.

00:05:22.769 --> 00:05:25.769
I had to focus on what I could do.

00:05:25.769 --> 00:05:31.769
But like Elizabeth, I got an unexpected blessing.

00:05:31.769 --> 00:05:36.769
My aunt and uncle wanted to do more time to help me with Mama.

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:39.769
Grateful for what I had done all those years.

00:05:39.769 --> 00:05:43.769
Jehovah had turned his attention to me.

00:05:43.769 --> 00:05:50.769
He paved a way for me to be able to pioneer even though I thought that it would never be possible.

00:05:50.769 --> 00:06:00.009
I just wanted to say, you've always been someone I've looked up to.

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:02.009
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:14.970
Sister Fernandez, do you mind going out with Sister Garcia?

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.970
Very good. So how about we conclude with a prayer?

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:25.589
You ready?

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:27.589
I actually know.

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:30.589
It's okay. I have the term visits and I could drive too.

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:31.589
Oh, okay.

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:36.180
Sorry I'm a mess this morning.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.180
I was up late again.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.180
I want everything to be perfect for the gathering next week.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:48.759
You do so much to build others up.

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:54.759
But are you taking the time to build yourself up?

00:06:54.759 --> 00:07:02.660
You know, that's a good question.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.660
You know helped me, Mary.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.660
Gonzales?

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.660
Jesus' mother.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:17.360
Oh, I took Rosa's suggestion.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.930
And as a family, we watched the good news according to Jesus again.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.930
But I focused on Mary's example.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.930
She never missed an opportunity to learn about Jehovah

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.930
and deepen her personal relationship with him.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:37.930
When she spoke with Elizabeth, her words showed the depth of her faith

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:53.139
and love for God.

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:56.620
I'm so glad we watched that again.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.620
I really appreciated how Mary magnified Jehovah

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.620
with everything she had.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.620
And he loved her for it.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.620
Yeah, you could really see what he chose her.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.620
She knew the scriptures so well.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.959
But it's not just that.

00:08:11.959 --> 00:08:13.959
She was deep.

00:08:13.959 --> 00:08:15.959
She understood them.

00:08:15.959 --> 00:08:19.720
I used to be like that.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.720
What are you talking about?

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.720
I need to do more to feed myself spiritually.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.720
What can I do to help?

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.720
You do so well at caring for our family's spiritual needs.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.720
I appreciate that so much.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.720
But I need to start setting aside some personal time

00:08:37.720 --> 00:09:01.299
to deepen my relationship with Jehovah.

00:09:01.299 --> 00:09:03.299
I have territory, and I can drive.

00:09:03.299 --> 00:09:10.610
That sounds good.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:11.610
Hey.

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:12.610
Hey, babe.

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.610
You need to talk.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:15.610
Okay.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.610
My boss called me in right at the end of the day.

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:21.610
Said that I need to start traveling for two weeks out of the month.

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:24.610
What did you tell him?

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:26.610
I told him I would think about it.

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:30.610
I only have till the end of the week to decide.

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:32.610
I can't lose this job.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:42.879
They've really put you in a dark spot.

00:09:42.879 --> 00:09:45.879
It feels impossible.

00:09:45.879 --> 00:09:49.879
What does Jehovah want you to do?

00:09:49.879 --> 00:09:52.879
He wants me to provide for my family, but...

00:09:52.879 --> 00:09:54.879
What does that really mean?

00:09:54.879 --> 00:10:03.889
What does it mean?

00:10:03.889 --> 00:10:08.169
It's not just money.

00:10:08.169 --> 00:10:32.399
What would happen if I spend all this time away?

00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:45.200
What kind of husband and father do I want to be?

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:55.169
Joseph worked hard without sacrificing time with his family,

00:10:55.169 --> 00:11:27.059
invested in them spiritually.

00:11:27.059 --> 00:11:36.860
I need to provide for my family in every way.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.860
I can't do that if I'm not here.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:52.320
We sat down as a family and discussed ways that we could simplify,

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.320
knowing that I might lose my job.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.320
We weren't sure how Jehovah was going to take care of us,

00:11:59.320 --> 00:13:03.539
but we were ready to trust him.

00:13:03.539 --> 00:13:05.539
I'm so sorry, I'm running late.

00:13:05.539 --> 00:13:07.539
No problem, my dear.

00:13:07.539 --> 00:13:15.090
For the Davis, could you take John and the Garcia's with you?

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:16.090
Thank you.

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:19.090
Lucia, are you still taking Pearl on some return visits?

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:20.090
Yes, that's the plan.

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:22.090
Great.

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:26.090
I don't know why I'm always the one having to clean up someone else's mess.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:29.090
It's really frustrating, you know?

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:38.549
Sometimes it's just too much.

00:13:38.549 --> 00:13:40.549
But what am I supposed to think?

00:13:40.549 --> 00:13:48.299
I'm not a doctor that is a lot of anxiety.

00:13:48.299 --> 00:13:51.299
It's too much to carry on your own.

00:13:51.299 --> 00:13:55.299
Remember, first Peter, five-seven?

00:13:55.299 --> 00:14:01.409
Through all your anxiety on Jehovah.

00:14:01.409 --> 00:14:05.409
But Lucia, how much anxiety do you want to keep?

00:14:05.409 --> 00:14:08.409
And how much do you want to give to Jehovah?

00:14:08.409 --> 00:14:17.659
Thank you, Pearl.

00:14:17.659 --> 00:14:19.659
I really needed your advice this morning.

00:14:19.659 --> 00:14:22.659
But I feel like I spent the whole time talking about myself.

00:14:22.659 --> 00:14:24.659
How are you?

00:14:24.659 --> 00:14:26.659
I have my struggle,

00:14:26.659 --> 00:14:29.659
but I'm grateful I went out with you today, my dear.

00:14:29.659 --> 00:14:32.659
Me too, and I'm so glad we got that return visit home.

00:14:32.659 --> 00:14:33.659
Yes.

00:14:33.659 --> 00:14:35.659
I'll see you at the meeting tomorrow night.

00:14:35.659 --> 00:14:52.379
I'll see you at the meeting tomorrow night.

00:14:52.379 --> 00:14:56.379
Anna was never missing from the temple.

00:14:56.379 --> 00:15:01.379
Night in the age she was there, ready to encourage others.

00:15:01.379 --> 00:15:05.379
As a result, Jehovah blessed her.

00:15:05.379 --> 00:15:10.379
And her account was recorded for us.

00:15:10.379 --> 00:15:15.379
The brothers and sisters may not always know the struggles I have.

00:15:15.379 --> 00:15:17.379
But Jehovah does.

00:15:17.379 --> 00:15:24.909
And I am so thankful to be part of his family.

00:15:24.909 --> 00:15:26.909
Perna, it's so good to see you.

00:15:26.909 --> 00:15:28.909
Good to see you.

00:15:28.909 --> 00:15:31.909
Perla, you're always the first one here.

00:15:31.909 --> 00:15:33.909
There is no place I'd rather be.

00:15:33.909 --> 00:16:00.710
Wait, she said what?

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.710
Yeah, man, it was weird.

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:07.549
Thanks, boys.

00:16:07.549 --> 00:16:09.549
We'll be ready to eat soon.

00:16:09.549 --> 00:16:11.549
It's true means we got an hour. Let's get a game in.

00:16:11.549 --> 00:16:16.809
All right.

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:19.809
Wait, so I thought you said she had a girlfriend.

00:16:19.809 --> 00:16:23.809
Yeah, she does, but she likes boys and girls.

00:16:23.809 --> 00:16:25.809
Oh.

00:16:25.809 --> 00:16:28.809
But she said it's not that big of a deal, though.

00:16:28.809 --> 00:16:30.809
Wait, so then what'd you tell her?

00:16:30.809 --> 00:16:32.809
Nothing. I go sit there.

00:16:32.809 --> 00:16:34.809
You can't just avoid her.

00:16:34.809 --> 00:16:36.809
Oh, you got to stand up for your beliefs.

00:16:36.809 --> 00:16:39.809
Yeah, and say what? You know, you're cute and whatever,

00:16:39.809 --> 00:16:42.809
but the Bible told me I can't hook up with you.

00:16:42.809 --> 00:16:45.809
Come on, man.

00:16:45.809 --> 00:16:47.809
I know what I'm supposed to say and everything,

00:16:47.809 --> 00:16:50.809
but if I say it, everyone's just going to think I'm like,

00:16:50.809 --> 00:16:52.809
close-minded or something.

00:16:52.809 --> 00:16:54.809
And why do you care what they think?

00:16:54.809 --> 00:16:56.809
I mean, sometimes it's just like,

00:16:56.809 --> 00:17:00.809
I don't even know what I believe or why I believe it.

00:17:00.809 --> 00:17:05.089
But isn't it worth trying to figure it out?

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:07.089
Is that even possible?

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:09.089
That's what Jesus did.

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:13.089
The religious teachers back then, they were teaching things

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:16.089
that were completely different than what the scriptures taught.

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:19.089
But Jesus, even as a kid,

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:22.089
he wasn't confused or intimidated by them.

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:24.089
He knew the truth,

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:27.089
and he wasn't afraid to take a stand for it.

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:31.089
I had to ask Jova to help me believe the truth like that.

00:17:31.089 --> 00:17:34.089
And has he helped you?

00:17:34.089 --> 00:17:38.089
Well, so far, every time I've had a question, I found answers.

00:17:38.089 --> 00:17:42.089
Let me actually share with you an interesting article I found.

00:17:42.089 --> 00:17:45.089
But he showed me that the things I struggle with,

00:17:45.089 --> 00:17:48.089
the questions I thought were complicated,

00:17:48.089 --> 00:17:51.089
had clear answers in God's word.

00:17:51.089 --> 00:17:57.089
The world is so confused about what's right and what's wrong.

00:17:57.089 --> 00:18:00.089
Maybe that's why it seems they're so unhappy.

00:18:00.089 --> 00:18:08.190
But Jova's standards are always better for us.

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:17.619
And he gives us friends we can learn from.

00:18:17.619 --> 00:18:21.619
Friends who help us draw close to him.
