00:00:02.799 --> 00:00:08.800
Taiwan has implemented a compulsory military service system for many years.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:16.800
However, in the year 2000, things changed when the government set up an alternative civilian service program.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:25.800
Those who are conscientious objectors may apply after being thoroughly screened and approved is qualified.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.800
After entering the program, they are given an assignment in the public sector,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.799
such as working in city halls, police stations, schools, or hospitals.

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:47.049
How has the alternative civilian service program affected society in Taiwan?

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:52.049
Alternative service is supervised by the Interior Ministry.

00:00:52.049 --> 00:01:00.049
This service is not supervised by the Ministry of Defense because it supervises the military and military service.

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:08.980
The Ministry of Interior supervises social welfare services.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:15.980
So it was decided that the Ministry of Interior would supervise alternative service from start to finish,

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.980
from the initial training right up to release from service.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.980
Alternative service really fills three needs.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.980
First, the need to reduce military personnel.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:39.980
Second, the long time need to accommodate the beliefs of religious people toward military service.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.980
And third, the need to care for disadvantaged families.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.980
That's why some can choose alternative service for family reasons.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.980
So what we're talking about here is the second of these three needs,

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:03.799
that is to cater to the needs of those with religious convictions.

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.800
Alternative service benefits the country and the community in many ways.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:17.800
This is very evident in the 16 different types of alternative service in government and social welfare agencies.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:29.800
Looking at the statistics, the various agencies' satisfaction rate toward alternative services is about 90%, even up to 97%.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.800
We are a community hospital that is part of a regional teaching hospital.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.800
Our main goal is to connect with our community.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.800
And the arrival of individuals serving an alternative civilian services has contributed greatly to this goal,

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.800
by providing many needed services.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.800
It really is an honor to work with them.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.800
In fact, I would say it's a pleasure to see that they are willing to work at our hospital.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:08.449
Some may say that if those who apply for alternative service on religious grounds are given priority,

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:14.449
would it happen that some use religion as a pretext to avoid military service?

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:20.449
No, because you have social service. It's about helping the community.

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:27.449
So all along, alternative service on religious grounds has not led to any increase in numbers.

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:32.449
In fact, up to now, we have about from 10 to 30 applicants each year.

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:39.449
And from the year 2000, when the program first started, we have only had about 700 applicants.

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:43.449
And this is over 15, 16 years.

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:46.449
There hasn't been an increase in number.

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:51.449
Why? Because as I said, alternative service is hard work.

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:55.449
They still have to do a good eight hours work a day.

00:03:56.449 --> 00:04:01.449
And for those with genuine religious faith, they are there to serve the community.

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:05.449
They want to help the disadvantaged families.

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:08.449
The number won't suddenly surge.

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:12.449
There is no point in using religion as a pretext.

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:19.449
Because if anyone wants to apply for alternative service, you can do so without using religion as a reason.

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:23.449
You can come in and help community service.

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:33.449
Only those with genuine faith who cannot accept participation in warfare or in killing would apply on religious terms.

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.449
So there won't be an increase in number.

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:40.449
That's what we've observed.

00:04:41.449 --> 00:05:00.470
Of course, there needs to be a system in place to review whether an applicant is truly qualified for alternative service.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.470
So there are three levels of review.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:09.470
But let me say this, we don't assume that applicants are trying to beat the system through some loophole.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:17.470
No. After all, alternative service is not easy work. They still need to work an eight hour day.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:31.899
So the review process starts at the local district office level, moving on to the county or municipal government level, then finally to the review committee of the interior ministry.

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:38.899
Applications are first forwarded to the grassroots level of our government, the local district office.

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:51.220
They do the first level review. If the application is made for religious reasons, the application form asks which religion or faith.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:57.220
The applicant needs to meet the requirement of being a member of his religion for at least two years.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:06.459
Of course, his application must be accompanied by some certification from his religious organization.

00:06:06.459 --> 00:06:11.120
And this is to verify his membership.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:20.120
In addition, we feel it's also important that we look at their religious beliefs to ascertain how he is genuinely bound by those beliefs.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:38.120
So we believe that as in your case, if the applicant has a clearly certified membership of at least two years, plus clearly explained religious convictions, that would be sufficient.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:46.120
Many Jehovah's Witnesses have applied and participated in alternative civilian service. How is this helped them personally?

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:57.120
I feel that this program is really important for all our members in Taiwan, because we can continue our ministries and attend meetings while fulfilling our civic duty.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:08.120
And most importantly, we can do so without violating any Bible principles. Like the ones stated in Isaiah, we will not learn more anymore.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:16.120
So being able to fulfill the required civic duty without violating our conscience is something that we truly appreciate.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:24.120
Members serving in alternative service are assigned in public sectors such as government departments or healthcare institutions.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.120
The following is an example of an assignment in a hospital.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:38.120
I usually work in the hospital secretary office doing paperwork. We have scheduled times every week to help clean and maintain hospital grounds.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:45.120
And we have the opportunity to work with senior citizens and accompany them during their activities.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:52.120
We assist staff members by trimming trees and cleaning the area in and around the hospital campus.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:08:02.120
As for the seniors, they have weekly music sessions. We get to sing with them, play ball games, do exercises, and sometimes just chat with them.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:09.120
I feel that through these activities, I get the opportunity to help and to care for them.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:22.379
Around 2000-2001, there were still many serving prison terms because of their religious beliefs.

00:08:22.379 --> 00:08:34.379
So when we implemented alternative service, the law specifically allowed individuals to choose alternative service on religious grounds, rather than go to prison.

00:08:34.379 --> 00:08:40.379
This helped us solve a religious human rights problem that existed in our country for a long time.

00:08:40.379 --> 00:08:43.379
And the effect was excellent.

00:08:44.379 --> 00:08:59.379
Religious people often have a good spirit in serving their community, so they are assigned to social service agencies in hospitals and nursing homes.

00:08:59.379 --> 00:09:09.379
And I find that they serve with much enthusiasm because this activity is really in line with their own religious beliefs.

00:09:09.379 --> 00:09:17.860
This is how we handle the situation. And in my opinion, this has been a very successful program.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:27.000
Others share the same feeling that I have, and I'm very happy to see this development.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
I feel very happy and very proud.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:41.000
So really, we have nothing to worry about when religious people apply to go through the system because they really want to serve.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
We don't need to discipline them. They have the enthusiasm.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
In fact, the more who come forward to apply the better. We should welcome them.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And I say to my colleagues, we should really welcome more.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Actually, several dozen a year is not enough, frankly. In our system, we can really promote this further.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:10.000
The first time I came in contact with conscientious objectors was in Puli. We had maybe four or five of them.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
It was also the first time I had ever heard of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:26.000
So I went online and did some research about them, and found that they are a very organized, family-oriented church.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:39.000
I've observed that these conscientious objectors have excellent work ethics. They work well as a team, and their attitudes had a positive impact on others who are also in the program.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:51.000
There is no doubt that alternative service has had a positive impact on our society and on individuals enrolled in this program.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000
I am extremely grateful that we have the alternative civilian service program.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000
It prevented me from the predicament of facing multiple prison sentences.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:17.259
But most importantly, this program has allowed me to better utilize my time and energy to serve others.

00:11:17.259 --> 00:11:25.259
Respect for people with religious faith and respect for religion is an important part of basic human rights.

00:11:25.259 --> 00:11:35.049
In fact, from a human rights standpoint, military service should be fair and equal.

00:11:35.049 --> 00:11:43.490
If you were to say to a group your exempt from military service, that wouldn't be too equal, would it?

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:49.490
So based on the need for fairness, alternative service doesn't involve very light work.

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:58.490
Putting the alternative service program into our law books shows that we view it with respect and is very important.

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:07.490
I think that when all other countries of the world see our program, they would very likely envy us and want to learn from our experience.

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:11.490
As a country, we respect the human rights of religious groups.

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:16.490
In fact, I don't think I'm really biased towards religious people.

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:22.769
But the goals of their religious faith is to serve others.

00:12:22.769 --> 00:12:30.769
And this is really in harmony with the social functions of alternative service to serve people.

00:12:30.769 --> 00:12:36.769
So we should welcome more religious individuals into such service.

00:12:36.769 --> 00:12:43.769
This also solved a problem regarding human rights.

00:12:43.769 --> 00:12:50.529
This is another benefit, you might say.

00:12:50.529 --> 00:13:02.529
At one time, we had the situation where there were people of religious conscience in jail and people with little conscience outside of jail.

00:13:02.529 --> 00:13:12.529
Resolving this contradiction shows our respect for human rights.

00:13:13.529 --> 00:13:26.870
But let me say this, going back to the basic idea of including religious individuals in alternative service, we welcome them because they are ready to serve.

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:30.870
They are enthusiastic. They don't need to be disciplined.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:35.870
How often say this? They serve with eagerness.

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:51.340
Of course, every country is different and each country's need for alternative service may not be the same.

00:13:51.340 --> 00:14:02.340
But look at the excellent results we've experienced. Look at how this doesn't conflict with military service.

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:11.809
In particular, we would welcome other countries to see how alternative service for religious reasons works.

00:14:11.809 --> 00:14:18.809
Other countries are facing the same problem. Some refuse military service on account of their religious conscience.

00:14:18.809 --> 00:14:25.809
How do we solve the problem? Put them all in jail in large numbers? That serves no purpose at all.

00:14:25.809 --> 00:14:32.809
On the other hand, alternative service involves hard work. These people are willing to serve. They have enthusiasm.

00:14:32.809 --> 00:14:35.809
Let them take part.

00:14:35.809 --> 00:14:43.809
This is a solution to the problem of religious human rights and the problem of ensuring the fairness of military service.

00:14:43.809 --> 00:14:50.809
So I'm not saying our whole alternative service program is worth copying, but certainly the part related to religious faith is.

00:14:50.809 --> 00:14:58.809
It's good to have a system in parallel with regular military service as an alternative. That's the solution.

00:14:58.809 --> 00:15:07.809
But the result and benefits exceeded what we expected. Human rights, religious suppression, all of these things can be resolved.

00:15:07.809 --> 00:15:13.809
Most importantly, it promotes fairness in military service.

00:15:13.809 --> 00:15:18.809
So, human rights and military service, fairness, both are taken care of.

00:15:18.809 --> 00:15:26.809
I really hope other countries will come and draw lessons from my experience.

00:15:27.809 --> 00:15:36.809
Like many European nations, Taiwan has enjoyed great success in implementing alternative service and has reaped its benefits.

00:15:36.809 --> 00:15:44.809
Alternative service works not only in favor of the government, but also those who are conscientious objectors such as Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:15:44.809 --> 00:15:55.809
This program is a good solution, because these young men can serve their government and society in practical ways that do not violate their conscience.
