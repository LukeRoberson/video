00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.080
When you were younger, your parents were probably the first ones you ran to for advice.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:19.170
But now you might feel that your parents just don't understand you.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.170
Deep down, you still want to talk to them.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.170
But what if you try and you feel they just aren't listening?

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.170
Well, you could raise your voice, but shouting won't make your parents more receptive

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.170
and won't show them the respect they deserve.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.170
You could give your parents the silent treatment, but the Bible suggests at Proverbs 15-22

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.170
that things only get more frustrating when you don't talk.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.170
So saying nothing really gets you nowhere.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.170
It's smarter to just wait for a better time to talk,

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:01.170
or you might even write them in an honest but respectful letter expressing how you feel.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.170
But what if the situation is flipped?

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.170
Yeah, that's right. Your parents want to talk, but you don't.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.170
Maybe you had a bad day at school.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.170
It's true that choosing to talk when you don't feel like it could mean the conversation will be forced,

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.170
which makes everyone tense and leads to poor communication.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.170
But refusing to talk means you'll still be stressed,

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.170
and your parents might think that the problem is bigger than it is,

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.170
or worse, that you're hiding something.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.170
Instead, you could start off talking with them on a subject that isn't as stressful,

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.170
or even one that makes you happy.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.170
That will ease the tension, or get rid of it altogether.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.170
The bottom line?

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.170
Your parents want to help you, and you can use their help.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.170
So, choose your words carefully, deliver them respectfully,

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.540
and think of your parents as friends, not enemies.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.539
Because let's face it, you'll need all the allies you can get to cope with the challenges that lie ahead.
