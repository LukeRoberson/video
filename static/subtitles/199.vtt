00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:09.939
Today, we will talk about those who are close to all of our hearts, our children.

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:15.660
I'm sure that you, dear parents, greatly love and appreciate your children.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.899
What a privilege it is to have them.

00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:20.899
Think about it.

00:00:20.899 --> 00:00:29.179
There are millions of angels, however, angels were not given the privilege to produce children.

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:36.420
When Jesus was on earth, He was not married, so He did not have the privilege of having children.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.460
But you, parents, have that privilege.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.700
What a treasure.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.659
What does the governing body want to tell you children?

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:49.259
That we love you.

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:56.140
We are so happy to have you with us, and we would like to help you to become and remain

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.700
worshipers of Jehovah.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.979
You are like a beautiful gift, a special gift from Jehovah.

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:10.260
Christian parents value and appreciate you children more than a million dollars.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.340
How do we know?

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:22.500
Because Psalm 127 verse 3 says that children are an inheritance from Jehovah.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.980
What does that mean?

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.739
An inheritance is a very valuable gift that has been given to someone.

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:35.140
Often the gift is from an older family relative.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:42.900
Jehovah views you children as a very valuable gift that he has given to your parents.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.219
He expects parents to take good care of this gift.

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:54.739
He entrusts parents with the welfare and happiness of their children.

00:01:54.739 --> 00:02:02.180
And when parents do their best for you, it especially makes us happy when you children

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.819
do your best to please and serve Jehovah.

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:12.780
There are so many children earth wide who are fine examples for others by means of their

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.780
love for Jehovah and the truth.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.460
Parents will your children become good examples for other young ones in the truth?

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:30.060
One father of seven children all of whom grew up as lovers of Jehovah would always tell

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.900
new parents that there are no guarantees with children.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.539
They each have their own personality and are exposed to various outside influences.

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:46.819
But he would always urge new parents to do the best they can to teach their children

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.900
and reach their hearts.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.979
Your conscientious effort increases the possibility of them becoming a success in Jehovah's

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:57.740
service.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.460
So parents, how are you caring for your inheritance?

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:10.259
What are some vital steps to teach and reach the heart of your child?

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:17.539
First, please locate judges 13 verse 8.

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:25.819
The parents of Samson likely prayed often for Jehovah's help to properly raise their son.

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:35.020
Verse 8 says, Manoa, lead with Jehovah and said, Pardon me, Jehovah, please, let the man

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:42.020
of the true God whom you just sent come again to instruct us about what we should do with

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.780
the child who will be born.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.580
If you parents do the same, Jehovah will answer your prayers through the Scriptures, Bible

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.460
literature, or possibly by means of a congregation meeting.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:04.939
Additionally, being consistent with family worship is vital to reach the heart of one child.

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:11.060
It is true that it takes some planning and absorbs some of your time each week.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:18.259
But remember that in 2008, the governing body gave us all the extra time each week for

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:23.220
family worship by adjusting the weekly meeting schedule.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:30.300
A brother from Portugal wrote, Aside from family worship, my father had a separate Bible

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.860
study on a different day with each of us three children.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:40.740
I'm sure that these studies were very important for us to resist all of the pressures

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.980
at school.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.300
It is no surprise that all three children have been in special full-time service for a number

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.660
of years now.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:59.259
Similarly, a brother from Northern Italy wrote, We studied with each one of our children personally

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:03.500
in harmony with their age and gender.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.819
Each family head must decide what is best for his family.

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:15.220
However, a well-prepared family worship program is essential.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.699
Another excellent way to teach your children is by example.

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.699
Children often pick up mannerisms from their parents.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:28.459
They often walk and talk like one of the parents.

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:34.220
But they also pick up on godly personality traits and attitudes.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.620
So be the kind of person that you want your child to be.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:45.379
Even though Jesus was the only perfect child ever born on earth, it appears that his mother,

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:51.259
Mary, and adoptive father Joseph, were good examples for him.

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:59.139
Luke 2.41 and 42 tells us that Jesus' parents were accustomed to go from year to year to

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:03.620
Jerusalem for the Passover.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.899
Eve could have viewed the trip as inconvenient and even too expensive.

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:16.490
But as parents, he and Mary said a good example for the young boy, Jesus.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:22.129
Most young ones can quote 1 Corinthians 15-33 by heart.

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:28.209
Maybe it is because their parents have reminded them of the principle so often.

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:34.220
Bad associations spoil useful habits.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:40.180
Do you remember in Luke chapter 8 that Jesus spoke about the different kinds of soil that

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.620
the word of God might fall on?

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.459
The soil represents your child's heart.

00:06:47.459 --> 00:06:56.740
It is our hope and prayer that your child's heart is like good or fine soil.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:04.779
In verse 15, Jesus applied the illustration of the fine soil, seeing,

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:10.579
these are the ones who, after hearing the word, with a fine and good heart, retain it

00:07:10.579 --> 00:07:14.259
and bear fruit with endurance.

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:19.060
But what can happen if after responding to your training from God's word, your child

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.740
is somehow exposed to bad association?

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:29.300
When young ones spend considerable time with other young ones who have not been trained

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:35.459
by Bible principles, it can counteract your training from God's word.

00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:42.420
Such association is like a severe rainstorm that erodes the fine soil that you have built

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.860
up.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:49.019
It can quickly wash away the good training that you have given.

00:07:49.019 --> 00:07:57.579
Some 1 verse 1 says that we can be happy if we do not walk with, stand with or sit with

00:07:57.579 --> 00:08:00.939
those who do what is bad.

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:09.980
And we could add to that and to not text or email others who do not think wholesome thoughts.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:15.139
Help your children to choose good associates.

00:08:15.139 --> 00:08:21.660
So many young ones around the world have responded to their parents fine instruction and express

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.579
themselves from the heart.

00:08:24.579 --> 00:08:29.740
Let me share a few experiences that demonstrate this.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:38.740
One young person from the United States wrote in saying, I am 11 years old and I am an unbaptized

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:39.740
publisher.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.299
I can't thank you enough for all that you do.

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:51.100
I especially appreciate all the time and effort you put into the Caleb and Sophia videos.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.019
I love these videos.

00:08:53.019 --> 00:08:57.059
They help me to show good conduct at school.

00:08:57.059 --> 00:09:01.100
I am grateful that you encourage family worship.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.659
You see, I used to have doubts about Jehovah.

00:09:04.659 --> 00:09:12.539
If it were not for the time at family worship, I probably would have drifted more and more.

00:09:12.539 --> 00:09:19.179
I love Jehovah and want to serve him but I still have lots to work on.

00:09:19.179 --> 00:09:24.860
I hope you will make more videos to help me and other young ones to serve Jehovah with

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:30.200
our whole heart and whole soul.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.279
We received this message.

00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:35.360
Hi, I am 10 years old.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.600
I just wanted to say thank you.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:45.799
When I grow up I want to work in Bethel, because I love Jehovah and want to make him happy.

00:09:45.799 --> 00:09:50.200
In paradise I want to open a zoo without cages.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.960
Finding all my love.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:59.200
I recall I once met an eight-year-old girl in Denver, Colorado, who was baptized at eight

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.960
years of age.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:06.639
By that time she had read the entire Bible through twice.

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:09.759
Of course each child is unique.

00:10:09.759 --> 00:10:15.320
Not all children become mature at the same rate or at the same point in life.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:22.919
You may recall that we read Psalm 127 verse 3 earlier which said that children are an

00:10:22.919 --> 00:10:27.000
inheritance from Jehovah.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Let's read the next verse number 4.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.559
Like arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the sons of one's youth.

00:10:37.559 --> 00:10:42.559
Children are likened to arrows that should be aimed at a target.

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:47.559
And archer cannot recall an arrow once it leaves his bow.

00:10:47.559 --> 00:10:49.399
Parents have arrows.

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:56.200
They have their children to aim at the target for a relatively brief time.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.440
And what is the target?

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.519
What is the goal?

00:11:00.519 --> 00:11:08.039
For your children to become whole, some dedicated and baptized servants of Jehovah.

00:11:08.679 --> 00:11:15.519
However, arrows can be made from different materials and they can vary in size.

00:11:15.519 --> 00:11:21.559
Parents must remember that no two children are precisely alike.

00:11:21.559 --> 00:11:28.399
Some have a good measure of mental and emotional maturity at a young age and express a desire

00:11:28.399 --> 00:11:31.000
to get baptized.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.480
Others may not be ready for baptism until they are a bit older.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:41.879
Others discerning parents do not pressure their children to get baptized.

00:11:41.879 --> 00:11:50.879
Rather, they assist each child in keeping with his or her own growth and spiritual progress.

00:11:50.879 --> 00:11:55.960
But it is also true that some parents underestimate their children.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:02.440
Some hold them back from dedicating their life to Jehovah even though they have developed

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:07.720
a close relationship with him as a youngster.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:12.279
We received this comment from a sister in Russia.

00:12:12.279 --> 00:12:15.360
Thank you very much for taking care of younger ones.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:19.320
I particularly appreciate your support.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.440
Your loving words inspire me.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.960
I am 17.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:29.639
I am invigorated by articles and videos which are prepared by you.

00:12:29.639 --> 00:12:33.960
Your work and love bring me to tears.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.000
Thank you very much.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.159
I am touched by your affectionate care of us here in Russia.

00:12:42.159 --> 00:12:46.519
Your warm words and prayers are the best comfort for us.

00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:49.320
I am grateful to you.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:54.559
Thanks to you taking care of me, I was able to begin pioneering two years ago.

00:12:54.559 --> 00:12:57.399
It's the best life ever.

00:12:57.399 --> 00:12:59.200
I am happy.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.200
I can't be silent.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.399
I am filled with gratitude.

00:13:04.399 --> 00:13:11.120
The Watchtower once commented, it has been said that grazing children is a 20-year project

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:16.159
but parents never really stop being parents.

00:13:16.159 --> 00:13:23.559
Among the very best things you can give to your children are love, time, and Bible-based

00:13:23.559 --> 00:13:24.559
training.

00:13:24.559 --> 00:13:29.120
Yes, endeavouring to reach their hearts.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:34.200
Admittedly, each child will respond differently to the training.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:41.279
However, many who have been raised by parents that love Jehovah feel like Duanamai, a sister

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:44.440
in Asia, she says.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:49.960
Looking back on the training I received from my parents, I am so thankful that they

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:54.559
disciplined me and taught me to love Jehovah.

00:13:54.559 --> 00:14:01.080
They did not just give me life, they gave me a meaningful life.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:09.429
And there are millions of adult Christians who would express similar sentiments of appreciation.

00:14:09.429 --> 00:14:16.230
Parents, take care of your inheritance, your precious children by training them and reaching

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:17.230
their heart.
