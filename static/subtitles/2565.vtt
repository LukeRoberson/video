00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:11.640
This was the first school in the Romani language in Bulgaria.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:23.890
In recent years, we have seen a remarkable growth in the Romani field.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.890
There are many Roma people living all over Bulgaria, generally in their own neighborhoods.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.890
The Roma came to Europe from India with their own languages and culture.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.890
Roma people are happy to talk to Jehovah's Witnesses, sensing no discrimination or prejudice.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.890
As a result, Romani congregations and groups have been formed.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:56.890
At the first memorial held in the Romani language, a congregation with 26 publishers had 703 in attendance.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:07.219
In this rapidly growing field, half of the publishers served as pioneers.

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:13.219
Seeing the progress in this field, the branch wanted the pioneers to be trained in their mother tongue,

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:18.219
so they could apply the information according to the needs of the territory.

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:24.219
This is a wonderful gift from Jehovah, because when we receive it in our own language,

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:28.219
it is embedded directly into our hearts.

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:32.219
I feel very happy that the school is in the Romani language,

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:37.219
because I can see it not only to Jehovah's love, but also how he spoils us.

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:48.700
This has been a wonderful achievement, considering we didn't have any material translated for the school in the Romani language.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.700
This meant that the instructors and the students prepared in a different language,

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.700
but everything was presented in Romani.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:07.700
I have to get up at 4.30 to go to and finish my secular work before the school, which starts at 8.30.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:18.780
It is a little difficult for me, but hearing about Jehovah and understanding more about him gives me renewed energy.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.780
I heard an example about Jesus, how he showed empathy for the young children who went to see him,

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.780
but his apostles tried to stop them.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.780
However, Jesus put himself in the place of those children.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.780
This really helps me to see the people in our territory and to put myself in their place,

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.780
because I too once lived like them and know how they feel.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:54.889
When we speak about spiritual things,

00:02:54.889 --> 00:03:00.889
things about God, we want to speak in our mother tongue because it touches our heart.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:16.189
I personally saw how the hearts of the pioneers were deeply touched by having the school in their language.

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:21.189
As a Roma, I often feel rejected by others, but the school which was completely opposite.

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:27.189
I was really happy that the school was held in our Romani neighborhood and I could speak in my language.

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:41.699
Who would have imagined 10 years ago when the preaching work started in the Roma neighborhood

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:46.400
that we would have a pioneer school?

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:54.400
Interestingly, some of those who started to study the Bible back then attended the school together with us,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.400
along with their Bible teachers.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.840
If someone had said that this would happen,

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.840
we would have thought it has a vivid imagination.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.840
The hover made this possible.
