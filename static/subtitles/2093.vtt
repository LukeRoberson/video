00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:09.070
After 14-year legal battle, the government of France repaid to Jehovah's Witnesses more than 8 million US dollars.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:17.070
Here with us to discuss this development is Mr Jean-Claude Ponce, who is a member of the National Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses in France.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.070
So Mr Ponce, could you briefly explain what happened?

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:31.070
Good afternoon sir. The French government just returned to us a 6 million Euros or a little more than 8 million US dollars.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:39.070
This money was unjustly collected from us and the reimbursement included interest and legal fees.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.070
But why did the government claim this money?

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:57.070
In 1998, the government claimed that all the donations received by Jehovah's Witnesses between 1993 and 1996 be subjected to a 60% retroactive tax.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:05.069
Thus, the government claimed from Jehovah's Witnesses the payment of a huge amount of 45 million Euros.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:12.069
No religious organization in France had ever faced such a crushing tax.

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:15.069
So how did Jehovah's Witnesses react?

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:24.069
We tried to find a solution with the tax official, but the government insisted that we pay the amount of the tax.

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:30.069
Then we have to litigate this matter before various jurisdiction in France.

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:39.069
At the end, we lost our case. And the only choice we had was to bring this matter before the European Court of Human Rights.

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:42.069
So what happened at the European Court?

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:51.069
The court found that by imposing such a tax, France was guilty of violating the freedom of religion of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:58.069
The court thus ordered France to remove all the consequences of the tax.

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:03.069
This includes returning the funds, paying interest and legal fees.

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:10.069
It is interesting to note that France was a founding member of the Council of Europe.

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:17.069
And by the fact, it is the first time that France is condemned for violating the freedom of religion.

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.069
Then how did the French government react?

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:29.069
What is surprising at first, the French government ignores the decision and it continued to demand the payment of the tax.

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.069
So a second judgment from the court was necessary.

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:40.069
The judgment tells the government that the tax was illegal and could not be imposed to Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:46.069
But how would these tax be a violation of religious freedom of Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:54.069
Because it was so huge, it could have resulted in the liquidation of the Jehovah's Witnesses at quarters.

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:00.069
And it would have been a major interference with our religious activities in France.

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.069
So finally, how do Jehovah's Witnesses feel about this case?

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:11.069
Jehovah's Witnesses are very happy that their right of freedom of religion has been protected by the European Court.

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:23.069
In no four years, we have been misrepresented quite often in the media, but this case shows that we are low-biting citizens and that we are practicing an established religion.

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:30.069
This is not only a victory for Jehovah's Witnesses, but also for the freedom of religion in France.

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.069
Thank you, Mr. Post.
