00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:28.179
Water is vital for life on Earth but in some places water is scarce or unfit to drink.

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:34.179
Humans have made efforts to obtain water that sustains life.

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:39.179
But how do animals survive in these environments?

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:42.179
They manage water wisely.

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:50.159
The Namib Desert is one of the driest places on the planet.

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:56.159
Yet on some days coastal fog drifts in land.

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:02.159
The fog is a source of water for a species of darkening people.

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:11.159
This people extracts water from the air by performing an unusual maneuver called fog basking.

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:19.159
It walks to the top of a dune, faces the wind and seems to stand on its head.

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.159
When the beetle is purged at an angle of about 23 degrees,

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:30.159
beads of water collect on its back and trickle down to its mouth.

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:40.129
But is it possible to survive without drinking any water?

00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:49.040
The kangaroo rat lives in arid parts of the North American West.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:56.040
It gets water from the food it eats, seeds, insects and green vegetation.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.040
It conserves the water, it absorbs, it doesn't pant, it doesn't sweat.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:10.479
Rather than licking its fur, it cleanses itself by bathing in sand.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:17.479
Its kidneys produce highly concentrated urine, reducing water loss through waste.

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:28.479
By conserving precious water in these ways, the kangaroo rat can survive without taking a single sip of water in its entire lifetime.

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:41.180
In contrast to the kangaroo rat or the darkling beetle, the leatherback sea turtle is surrounded by water, salt water.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:51.180
The turtle ingests high amounts of salt from seawater directly and from its primary food, jellyfish.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.180
Too much salt in the turtle's body would be poisonous.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.180
How does it eliminate excess salt?

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.180
It cries.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.180
These are not emotional tears.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.180
The tears are produced by two large salt glands in its head.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.180
The glands extract salt and expel it through the turtle's tears.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.180
The tears are thick and viscous and can be about twice as salty as the ocean.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:33.419
These turtles have been estimated to shed about eight litres or two gallons of tears every hour, maintaining a safe level of salt in their bodies.

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:42.419
In nature, animals find, conserve and purify water in remarkable ways.

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.419
What do you think?

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:51.419
Did the ability to manage water efficiently evolve or was it designed?
