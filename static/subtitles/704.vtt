00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:11.769
Well, 100 classes ago, in September of 1966, the 42nd class of Gilead graduated.

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:12.769
Here's their picture.

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:19.850
Now, if you look carefully, back in the left corner, you'll see a young man who graduated

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.129
on that day.

00:00:22.129 --> 00:00:27.420
That is our beloved brother, David Splein.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.100
And so it seemed appropriate to mention this occasion being its 100 classes ago.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.460
I did say classes not years.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.500
We're now looking forward to hearing from our dear brother, Splein.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.259
He is going to give us the talk, don't forget the purpose.

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:54.219
I'm glad they didn't get a hold of my baby picture.

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:01.179
That was my baby picture.

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:10.739
Well, I know that all of you students will agree that Gilead School has been a marvelous

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:15.780
expression of Jehovah's undeserved kindness.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.780
A dream come true.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.500
But really, all of us have been recipients of Jehovah's undeserved kindness in so many

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.500
ways.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.219
All of us have received training in so many ways.

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:34.780
So really, the Apostle Paul's words recorded at 2 Corinthians chapter 6 can apply to

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.780
all of us.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.980
Let's look it up.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:47.019
2 Corinthians chapter 6, we're going to read verses 1 and 2.

00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:52.340
2 Corinthians chapter 6, 1 and 2.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:00.859
And here Paul writes, working together with him, we also urge you not to accept the

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:06.700
undeserved kindness of God and miss its purpose.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.580
That's the theme of the talk, don't miss the purpose.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:18.539
And then verse 2 says, for he says, in an acceptable time I heard you, and in a day of salvation

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:25.340
I helped you, look, now is the especially acceptable time.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.460
Look, now is the day of salvation.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:38.620
Now let's focus, first of all, on the first words that Paul writes here, working together

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.020
with him.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.699
And that really explains why Paul's ministry was such a success.

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:52.500
Now Paul was a worker, but it wasn't enough to be a worker.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:59.860
Paul's ministry was successful because Paul was working together with Jehovah God.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.620
It was Jehovah's purpose that counted.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:10.419
As brother Samuelson brought out this morning, it was Jehovah's agenda that counted with

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:12.259
the Apostle Paul.

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:15.699
Well our goal should be the same.

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:19.099
And we could be tested at times.

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:27.020
Verse back home, you're waiting for a decision, and the decision is a long time coming.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.500
And you could be tempted to run ahead as we've heard this morning, act on your own.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:40.340
You'd be working, but when that temptation arises, keep repeating to yourself, working together

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.180
with him, working together with him, and it'll help.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.620
It'll help you to work within the bounds that the organization has set.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.860
And we heard about that this morning as well.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:01.099
Now notice at the beginning of verse two, Paul has been doing some reading.

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:07.620
First words, for he says, and then Paul quotes scripture.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:14.020
And it will be useful to us to look up the scripture that Paul is quoting because it

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.060
helps us to understand his thinking.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.540
When Paul was reading this verse or this passage, what was it that helped him to make the

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.300
connection with the idea of working together with Jehovah?

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:32.339
The scripture, Isaiah, chapter 49, verses 8 and 9.

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:41.180
So let's read that, Isaiah, chapter 49, verses 8 and 9.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:47.420
Now as I read this, I'd like you to see if you can guess when this scripture had its

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.139
first fulfillment.

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:50.860
It has two fulfillments.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:57.259
See if you can guess when the scripture was first fulfilled, verse 8.

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:03.620
This is what Jehovah says, in a time of favor I answered you, and in a day of salvation

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.899
I helped you.

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:14.180
I kept safeguarding you to give you as a covenant for the people to rehabilitate the land,

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:24.819
to cause them to possess their desolate inheritances to say to the prisoners, come out.

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:26.860
You got it?

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.379
Sure.

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:35.819
This scripture was fulfilled when the Israelites were being released from Babylonian captivity.

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:42.420
We have a few hints there to rehabilitate the land, desolate inheritances to say to the

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.379
prisoners, come out.

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:49.860
But now they were released from Babylon, but what was the purpose?

00:05:49.860 --> 00:06:00.819
It was twofold, a, to resettle Jerusalem and b, to reestablish pure worship, the pure

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:03.819
worship of Jehovah.

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:09.660
Now all is telling the Corinthians, we have to work together with Jehovah God.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.779
And he's been reading Isaiah 49, 8 and 9.

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:15.220
What's the connection?

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:25.220
Now to rehabilitate a land that had leoned desolate for 70 years would require a lot of work.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:34.180
So those who agreed to leave Babylon and come back to Jerusalem would have to be hard workers.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.100
But it wasn't enough to be a hard worker.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.579
To be successful they would have to be working along with Jehovah God because Jehovah God

00:06:41.579 --> 00:06:44.779
had a purpose in bringing them back to Babylon.

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:49.139
It wasn't just so they could come back to Jerusalem.

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:53.620
His purpose was to get his pure worship reestablished.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.180
So they were going to have to work together with him.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:03.300
Now as the watchtower pointed out recently, it would be a sacrifice on the part of something

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.459
to leave Babylon and go back to Jerusalem.

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:07.459
Why?

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:13.500
Well, do you remember what Jehovah had told the Israelites, the Jews when they went to Babylon,

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:19.540
build houses and live in them, plant gardens and eat their fruit, pray for the peace of the city

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.740
because in its peace you will have peace.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:29.259
So life in Babylon, captivity in Babylon wasn't totally like slavery in Egypt.

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:33.220
In fact, some Jews got rich in Babylon.

00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:39.420
Some became buyers and sellers of precious gems and it's thought that it's in Babylon

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:43.100
that the Jews learned trade and commerce.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:48.620
How to buy and sell so well, they didn't learn that on the pastures of Judah, that's for sure.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:55.620
And so it would have been a sacrifice on the part of some to leave Babylon and go to Jerusalem.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:59.180
Hard workers were willing to do that.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:05.060
Now the returning Jews started out very well, but they ran into problems.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.980
They ran into problems with the building of the temple.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:17.779
And as a result, they continued working, but they weren't working together with Jehovah anymore.

00:08:17.779 --> 00:08:20.899
They were building houses, decorating them.

00:08:20.899 --> 00:08:22.259
They were starting a business.

00:08:22.259 --> 00:08:27.660
They were looking after their own families, their own lives.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:33.179
Now could it be that some of them had reasoned, I've sacrificed enough.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:38.700
I've left a comfortable life in Babylon to come here to this wasteland,

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.580
and that's a lot more than my brothers in Babylon have done.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.379
I've sacrificed enough.

00:08:44.379 --> 00:08:51.500
It's time to look after my own family, look after my own children, let the young people do their share.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.019
Well, we don't know what they were reasoning.

00:08:54.059 --> 00:09:01.779
But the fact is that part B of Jehovah's purpose to reestablish pure worship was not being fulfilled.

00:09:01.779 --> 00:09:06.740
So they were not working together with Jehovah God.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.820
Application.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:14.820
All of you have made considerable sacrifices in order to go to your present assignments.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.580
Most of you were not born in your assignments.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:22.820
You went there of your own volition, and you made a lot of sacrifices.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:29.299
You learned another language, you made financial, material sacrifices, and so on.

00:09:29.299 --> 00:09:31.539
But you know there's a danger.

00:09:31.539 --> 00:09:38.259
As we get older, there can be a tendency for us to feel, you know, I've sacrificed enough.

00:09:38.259 --> 00:09:41.500
Why not let the young people do more?

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:46.620
Especially when we see those are our own age who are taking it easy.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.139
They'll be in the new world.

00:09:48.139 --> 00:09:50.700
Why do I have to work so hard?

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:58.059
And so off we're not careful, we could lose sight of the purpose of our training, and we don't want to do that.

00:09:58.059 --> 00:10:06.740
Now there's a second application to Isaiah 49, and we know that because of the way Paul puts it in 2 Corinthians 6.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.460
Let's go back there, 2 Corinthians 6.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:18.019
And you can leave your Bibles open there because for the rest of this discussion, we're going to be considering verses in 2 Corinthians 6.

00:10:18.019 --> 00:10:30.019
Now I'm going to read verse 2, and see if you can figure out how we know that Paul sees more than one application to this scripture, Isaiah 49.

00:10:30.019 --> 00:10:47.460
Verse 2, for he says, in an acceptable time I heard you, and in a day of salvation I helped you, look, now is not

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:58.259
acceptable, but the especially acceptable time, look, now is the day of salvation.

00:10:58.259 --> 00:11:00.299
You got it, didn't you?

00:11:00.299 --> 00:11:03.940
The definite and indefinite articles.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:16.539
When Paul is thinking about the deliverance of the Jews from Babylon, quoting Jehovah God, it's an acceptable time, it's a day of salvation, that was one application of the prophecy.

00:11:16.539 --> 00:11:21.100
But now Paul is telling the Christians that there's something much better.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:27.259
Now is the especially acceptable time, now is the day of salvation.

00:11:27.259 --> 00:11:33.860
Yes, when the Jews were delivered from Babylon, your worship was going to be reestablished.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:34.820
But what about today?

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:38.460
What about the work Christians are doing today?

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.940
The everlasting future of people is involved.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:50.580
And so if workers were needed back then, when the Jews were leaving Babylon, how hard should we be working today?

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:54.860
The lives of people are at stake.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:12:04.259
And so no matter how busy you are, no matter whether you're in Bethel, don't neglect the field.

00:12:04.259 --> 00:12:07.100
Have a zealous share in the preaching work.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:10.419
This is the work that Jesus commanded us to do.

00:12:10.419 --> 00:12:14.779
Jesus never spent a day in Bethel.

00:12:14.779 --> 00:12:22.659
He'll be very interested in what you do in Bethel, but he'll be even more interested in what you're doing in the field.

00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:25.299
Now let's focus on Jehovah's undeserved kindness.

00:12:25.299 --> 00:12:32.179
We talk about the undeserved kindness of being able to come to Gilead and get this special training.

00:12:32.179 --> 00:12:34.539
But now what was the purpose?

00:12:34.539 --> 00:12:41.500
Why were you selected to come to Gilead and get this training?

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:46.460
Well, you're probably wondering that yourselves.

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:51.259
You were selected, first of all, because you're workers, you're hard workers.

00:12:51.259 --> 00:12:59.820
But you were also chosen because we believe that you were going to use your training unselfishly for the benefit of others.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:04.580
And how many speakers on this platform today have made that point?

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:08.100
The training is not to be kept to yourselves.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:13.980
You have been trained so that you can unselfishly benefit other people.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:20.299
You have been trained to be more effective in serving others.

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:27.419
Now when you return home, we know that your friends and fellow workers are going to be very pleased.

00:13:27.419 --> 00:13:29.899
Your humility.

00:13:29.899 --> 00:13:36.860
You're not going to be flashing your diploma, either physically or literally or figuratively.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.220
You're not going to be flaunting your knowledge.

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:44.100
You're not going to be correcting every small mistake and procedure.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:48.700
You're going to earn the respect of your fellow workers because of your humility,

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:53.620
because of your willingness to work alongside them and to do whatever needs to be done.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:14:01.299
In fact, the most powerful lesson that you teach may not be in anything you say,

00:14:01.299 --> 00:14:03.820
but it may be in your humility.

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:10.419
Your willingness to work humbly along with any arrangement or any assignment that has given you.

00:14:10.419 --> 00:14:13.019
In this, you'll be copying Paul's example.

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:19.740
If you've kept your Bible open at 2 Corinthians 6, we're going to be reading a few more verses.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:23.379
Now Paul mentions a lot in verses 4 to 6.

00:14:23.379 --> 00:14:28.820
A lot is involved in humbly serving the needs of our brothers,

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:34.179
and we're going to just highlight a few of these, verses 4 to 6.

00:14:34.179 --> 00:14:35.500
Paul writes,

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:45.019
but in every way we recommend ourselves as God's ministers by the endurance of much.

00:14:45.019 --> 00:14:54.059
By tribulations, by times of need, by difficulties, by meetings, by imprisonments, by riots,

00:14:54.059 --> 00:15:02.539
by hard work, by sleepless nights, by times without food, by purity,

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:09.820
by knowledge, by patience, by kindness, by only spirit.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.659
Now look at verse 4.

00:15:11.659 --> 00:15:14.980
One of the things Paul mentions is endurance.

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:19.100
We recommend ourselves as God's ministers by endurance.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:23.220
Now that's something all of us need to give attention to.

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:27.259
I suppose that you were serving at Bethel before Gilead,

00:15:27.259 --> 00:15:31.860
and you really, really enjoyed your work assignment.

00:15:31.899 --> 00:15:35.860
Well, you've been away for five months.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:40.100
What do you suppose has been happening while you were away?

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:45.580
Someone else got that work assignment, and you know what?

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:49.779
He's doing very, very well at that assignment.

00:15:49.779 --> 00:15:55.379
In fact, it may be that the department is not going to want to have you back

00:15:55.379 --> 00:15:56.700
when you return.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:02.379
And so you're given another assignment, one that you don't enjoy so much.

00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:08.740
Now someone else might say, I've been trained at Gilead for this, but not you.

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:14.460
You're going to have the attitude, well, if the work needs to be done, why shouldn't I do it?

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:18.259
And you see, your humility is going to be so appreciated.

00:16:18.259 --> 00:16:22.580
And remember, other Bethelites are watching you.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.379
They're intelligent.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:28.500
They know that you'd probably like to have had your old job back,

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:33.580
but your humility, insurefully applying yourself to whatever you're given to do,

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:35.899
is going to make a tremendous impression on them.

00:16:35.899 --> 00:16:37.220
In fact, you know what?

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:42.019
You're going to go up 10 points in their estimation.

00:16:42.019 --> 00:16:44.259
Well, you say, all right, I have to do it,

00:16:44.259 --> 00:16:48.220
but do I really have to be cheerful about it?

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.019
Yes, you do.

00:16:50.019 --> 00:16:52.299
That's a requirement.

00:16:52.299 --> 00:16:54.139
And you know why?

00:16:54.139 --> 00:16:56.620
At the regional convention last summer,

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.899
do you remember the definition of endurance?

00:16:59.899 --> 00:17:04.339
It's not just a matter of sticking it out until something better comes along,

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:06.220
but we have to be cheerful.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:12.019
We have to do what we're asked to do with a happy, positive attitude,

00:17:12.019 --> 00:17:15.339
not always looking for additional responsibility,

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:18.180
more privileges, a different work assignment,

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:23.579
being happy with what we are given to do.

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:25.579
Are you folks understand that?

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:28.180
I would love you for it.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.059
Now, in the same verse, verse four,

00:17:30.059 --> 00:17:33.099
Paul mentions difficulties.

00:17:33.099 --> 00:17:34.980
And there will be problems in the field.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.619
There will be problems at Bethel from time to time.

00:17:37.619 --> 00:17:41.059
And the question is this, will you be the type of person

00:17:41.059 --> 00:17:44.339
that fellow Bethelites or those in the congregation

00:17:44.339 --> 00:17:47.460
will want to talk to when difficulties arise?

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:52.259
Because whenever they talk to you, they always feel better after.

00:17:52.259 --> 00:17:55.259
You have such a good, positive attitude.

00:17:55.259 --> 00:17:58.019
What we know, you will.

00:17:58.019 --> 00:18:02.140
Now, in verse five, Paul mentions hard work.

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:05.299
When brothers and sisters get together for a gathering,

00:18:05.299 --> 00:18:08.619
we know that you're going to be one of the ones in the kitchen

00:18:08.619 --> 00:18:13.579
or one of the ones who stays behind after to help clean up.

00:18:13.579 --> 00:18:17.180
You're going to be volunteering to help clean the kingdom hall

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:20.500
or you're going to volunteer for a local construction project.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:25.299
You're going to be known as someone who enjoys serving others,

00:18:25.299 --> 00:18:29.339
someone who loves to get his hands dirty,

00:18:29.339 --> 00:18:32.460
not someone who shows up in a lovely white suit

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:35.059
when there's work to be done.

00:18:35.059 --> 00:18:38.940
Or if you have to wear a lovely white suit,

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.259
at least bring a change of clothes.

00:18:41.259 --> 00:18:45.299
So you can roll up your sleeves and help with the work.

00:18:45.299 --> 00:18:49.660
Well, notice in verse six, Paul mentions purity.

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:52.980
We would certainly never want to think that as long as we work hard

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:56.059
in our assignment at Bethel or in the field,

00:18:56.059 --> 00:19:01.900
Jehovah will turn a blind eye to any immorality on our part.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:07.019
Jehovah has no blind eye.

00:19:07.019 --> 00:19:10.819
A Paul mentions kindness in the same verse.

00:19:10.819 --> 00:19:14.779
Now, some of your brothers may get into a position of authority.

00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:20.420
And the question is, how are you going to use your authority?

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:27.019
The proper use of authority is to help others, to benefit others.

00:19:27.019 --> 00:19:31.579
And you will never, ever use your authority vindictively

00:19:31.579 --> 00:19:35.660
to punish someone or to get even for some slight,

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.660
perhaps holding someone back from a deserved privilege

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.700
just because he offended you.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:44.259
That's not the way we use authority.

00:19:44.259 --> 00:19:48.339
In same verse, Paul talks about Holy Spirit.

00:19:48.339 --> 00:19:51.380
And that's quite a help you to get along with others.

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:54.380
It'll help elders and department heads

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:57.140
to work peacefully to one another, with one another.

00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:00.220
To speak kindly and respectfully to one another,

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:04.940
to listen, to really listen to one another.

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:06.460
Now, you may have a little difference

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:09.700
with someone in the congregation or at Bethel.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:13.339
Then you hear that person give a morning worship comment

00:20:13.339 --> 00:20:17.579
or a fine public talk in the congregation.

00:20:17.579 --> 00:20:22.539
And his eyes shine as he's talking about the truth.

00:20:22.539 --> 00:20:24.619
You're sitting there.

00:20:24.619 --> 00:20:26.339
You observe that.

00:20:26.339 --> 00:20:28.259
And it hits you.

00:20:28.259 --> 00:20:31.980
This man, this man that I'm having a problem with,

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:36.140
really, really loves Jehovah.

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:38.019
And so do you.

00:20:38.019 --> 00:20:39.660
You have that in common.

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:44.180
So now, can't you get the rest to work?

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:48.339
Now, if we walk by the Spirit, as we heard from Brother

00:20:48.339 --> 00:20:51.940
Samuelson, we'll be careful not to lobby

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:55.819
or push our own agenda, because Jehovah might not

00:20:55.819 --> 00:20:58.019
agree with our agenda.

00:20:58.019 --> 00:21:00.019
And we'd never want to make the other elders

00:21:00.019 --> 00:21:04.259
or the department feel that they can't make any decision

00:21:04.259 --> 00:21:06.819
without our input.

00:21:06.819 --> 00:21:10.420
We would never want them to feel that in our absence,

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.859
we would have to go back and revisit every decision

00:21:12.859 --> 00:21:15.900
that has been made, as if they can't do a single thing without us,

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:20.380
because we're so clever, we've graduated from Gilead now.

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.900
We realize that they have Jehovah's Spirit, too.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:29.140
So don't be too impressed with your own ideas.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.420
I'm going to repeat that.

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:36.099
Don't be too impressed with your own ideas.

00:21:36.099 --> 00:21:38.700
When no scriptural principle is involved,

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:42.099
we'll be willing to yield if the majority of the elders

00:21:42.099 --> 00:21:45.420
make a decision that we don't particularly agree with.

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:49.660
So when that happens, don't pout, pray.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:53.740
Ask Jehovah to bless the decision that was made.

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:56.660
The decision that you didn't particularly agree with.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.700
Ask Jehovah to bless that decision.

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:02.500
And ask Jehovah to help you to be fully supportive

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.220
of the decision.

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.299
In that way, you'll be working along

00:22:06.299 --> 00:22:09.259
with Jehovah's purpose and what's his purpose

00:22:09.259 --> 00:22:11.940
to have a happy group of elders serving

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:14.259
the needs of their brothers and sisters.

00:22:14.259 --> 00:22:17.819
If the elders are happy, note out the congregation

00:22:17.819 --> 00:22:20.819
and the methyl family will be happy.

00:22:20.819 --> 00:22:25.779
Be resolved to allow nothing and no one

00:22:25.779 --> 00:22:30.380
to interfere with your unity on the body of elders.

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:32.220
I'm going to repeat that.

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:36.740
Be resolved to allow nothing or no one

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:42.740
to interfere with your unity on the body of elders.

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:45.380
Well, you know all these things.

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:48.579
These were just helpful reminders.

00:22:48.579 --> 00:22:53.579
But your time at Gilead has been a dream come true.

00:22:53.579 --> 00:22:56.420
But now it's time to use your training

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:59.019
to be of service to others.

00:22:59.019 --> 00:23:02.819
Remember, you have been trained for a purpose

00:23:02.819 --> 00:23:07.140
and the purpose to be more effective in unselfishly

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.660
serving others.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:14.579
Never, ever forget the purpose.

00:23:14.579 --> 00:23:38.779
And may God bless you.

00:23:38.779 --> 00:23:40.779
Well, we sincerely thank you, brothers

00:23:40.779 --> 00:23:45.900
plain, for those words of wisdom spoken from experience.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.259
Well, now we're privileged to hear greetings

00:23:48.259 --> 00:23:50.819
from our brothers and sisters of many different branches

00:23:50.859 --> 00:23:53.099
that are thinking about us here today.

00:23:53.099 --> 00:23:56.980
In fact, can you imagine 25 different branches

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.539
have sent greetings?

00:23:58.539 --> 00:24:00.660
So let me just share a few of these with you.

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:02.140
Of course, we can't share all of them,

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:06.019
but perhaps I can just epitomize some of the messages.

00:24:06.019 --> 00:24:09.819
For example, Armenia says, we are delighted

00:24:09.819 --> 00:24:13.380
to see how Jehovah is training more brothers and sisters

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:16.660
to take on additional responsibilities in his organization

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.980
for the advancement of kingdom interests.

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.819
Benin says, we know that the Gilead School has left

00:24:21.819 --> 00:24:24.500
an indelible impression on your mind

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.900
with memories you'll carry along all your life

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:31.660
and on your heart with a deeper appreciation and joy

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:35.619
in serving Jehovah in a closer relationship with him.

00:24:35.619 --> 00:24:40.539
Bulgaria says, we wish all of you much joy on this special day.

00:24:40.539 --> 00:24:43.299
Bulgaria branch keenly anticipates the arrival

00:24:43.299 --> 00:24:45.539
of one couple from this class.

00:24:45.539 --> 00:24:48.420
We pray for Jehovah's blessing on new students

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:51.660
wherever he asks you to serve him.

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:55.619
Italy said, with what will I repay Jehovah

00:24:55.619 --> 00:24:58.819
for all the good he has done for me?

00:24:58.819 --> 00:25:01.819
We are sure that these words well describe the feelings

00:25:01.819 --> 00:25:04.940
of you students of the 142nd class.

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:07.579
We rejoice with you in this special occasion

00:25:07.579 --> 00:25:10.779
and give thanks to Jehovah for the spiritual enrichment

00:25:10.779 --> 00:25:11.819
you enjoyed.

00:25:11.819 --> 00:25:15.140
We are confident it will be of great value to yourselves

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.700
and to the ones you'll be sharing it with in the days

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:21.380
to come, please receive the warmest brotherly affection

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:23.099
of the brothers in Italy.

00:25:23.099 --> 00:25:26.220
And finally, Kazakhstan wrote and said,

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:29.059
we would like to take this opportunity to pass our love

00:25:29.059 --> 00:25:32.380
and greetings to the 142nd class of Gilead

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:34.220
on this graduation day.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:36.779
We are confident that they will never forget these

00:25:36.779 --> 00:25:40.019
past five months as they have walked hand in hand

00:25:40.019 --> 00:25:43.619
with our God, Jehovah, journeying page by page

00:25:43.619 --> 00:25:45.220
through his word, the Bible.

00:25:45.259 --> 00:25:48.019
Our thoughts and prayers are with them

00:25:48.019 --> 00:25:49.259
on this momentous day.

00:25:49.259 --> 00:26:00.509
Isn't that wonderful?

00:26:00.509 --> 00:26:01.789
Well, now we know that many of you

00:26:01.789 --> 00:26:03.990
like to hear the statistics about the class.

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:06.230
So let me share with you some of the details

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:08.910
about this class, the 142nd.

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:12.069
So the class was made up of nine single brothers,

00:26:12.069 --> 00:26:14.470
four single sisters.

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:19.470
The average age of the students was 44.2.

00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:23.549
The average years in the truth was 28.

00:26:23.549 --> 00:26:28.549
And the average years in the full-time ministry was 21.6.

00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:31.710
So obviously, a very mature class.

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:32.589
What a pleasure.

00:26:32.589 --> 00:26:35.390
It's been to have them here at Patterson.

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:39.430
Well, now we're ready for the presentation of the diplomas,

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:42.109
the part that we always look forward to so much.

00:26:42.109 --> 00:26:45.549
And Brother Ken Flodin, a helper to the teaching committee,

00:26:45.549 --> 00:26:48.670
is going to assist me in presenting them.

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:50.589
We have Brother and Sister Aji Boya.

00:26:50.589 --> 00:27:01.609
They'll be returning to Russia.

00:27:01.609 --> 00:27:03.009
And this is Brother and Sister Aum.

00:27:03.009 --> 00:27:12.289
They'll be returning to Nigeria.

00:27:12.289 --> 00:27:23.130
Brother and Sister Andriyapulas, they'll return to Greece.

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:24.650
This is Brother Antoine.

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:32.230
He's going back to Haiti.

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:41.299
Brother Belus is returning to Ukraine.

00:27:41.299 --> 00:27:42.859
And this is Brother and Sister Crips,

00:27:42.859 --> 00:27:50.250
they'll return to Peru.

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:58.829
Sister D'Shavas, returning to the Philippines.

00:27:58.829 --> 00:28:00.589
And this is Brother Durga Vorkian,

00:28:00.589 --> 00:28:07.640
going back to Armenia.

Brother and Sister Francholi, going back to Italy.

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:26.549
And now we have Brother and Sister Hoffman.

00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:29.509
Now, Brother and Sister Hoffman have been serving

00:28:29.509 --> 00:28:31.990
in the circuit work in France.

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:35.430
But they're receiving a new assignment today.

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:37.589
As some of you may know, the service committee

00:28:37.589 --> 00:28:42.829
has set up some language circuits that span all of Europe

00:28:42.829 --> 00:28:46.670
in order to try to move different language fields ahead.

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:48.869
And so Brother Hoffman will be taking up

00:28:48.869 --> 00:28:51.390
a circuit in the Romany field that will

00:28:51.390 --> 00:29:02.970
span several countries in Europe.

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:04.450
Sister Hubert.

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:08.049
Sister Hubert has been serving as a special pioneer in Paraguay.

00:29:08.049 --> 00:29:12.049
But now she is going to take up a field missionary assignment

00:29:12.049 --> 00:29:15.529
in a country where there is a great need for missionaries,

00:29:15.529 --> 00:29:26.630
the United States.

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:27.869
Brother Hurley.

00:29:27.869 --> 00:29:30.109
Brother Hurley has been serving at the branch office,

00:29:30.109 --> 00:29:32.309
as you heard, in Australasia.

00:29:32.309 --> 00:29:34.710
But now he's going to take up a new assignment

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:43.960
at the branch in Papua, New Guinea.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.000
And Brother and Sister Jager and Oth are

00:29:46.079 --> 00:29:54.750
going to return to Trinidad and Tobago.

00:29:54.750 --> 00:30:03.390
Brother Colligia returning to Turkey.

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:04.910
This is Brother Kilgore.

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:07.750
Brother Kilgore has been serving at the branch office

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:08.829
in Canada.

00:30:08.829 --> 00:30:11.589
But now he'll be taking up a new assignment

00:30:11.589 --> 00:30:22.599
at the branch office in Mexico, the Central America branch.

00:30:22.599 --> 00:30:32.660
Brother and Sister Mariah returned to Britain.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.539
And Brother and Sister Mendeas are returning

00:30:34.539 --> 00:30:43.069
to Central America.

00:30:43.069 --> 00:30:53.380
And this is Brother and Sister Mensa returning to Liberia.

00:30:53.380 --> 00:31:02.000
Sister Gomez returning to Tanzania.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.400
This is Brother Nanjiri.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:11.740
He's returning to Burundi.

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:13.539
Brother and Sister Pallanen.

00:31:13.539 --> 00:31:15.220
Now Brother and Sister Pallanen have been

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:18.380
serving for some years at the branch office in Finland.

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.259
But now they're receiving a new assignment

00:31:20.259 --> 00:31:29.250
to serve at the branch office in Bulgaria.

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:30.970
Next is Brother and Sister Chefsick.

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:39.650
They'll be going back to Central Europe.

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:48.420
Brother Tamayo returns to Ecuador.

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:50.019
And Brother and Sister Topia will also

00:31:50.019 --> 00:31:56.690
be going back to Ecuador.

00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:59.170
Now Brother Thomas has been serving at the branch office

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:00.569
in Central Europe.

00:32:00.569 --> 00:32:03.009
But now he's going to take up a new assignment

00:32:03.009 --> 00:32:12.700
in the branch office in Benin.

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:14.460
And this is our last couple.

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:30.000
Brother and Sister Vickner returning to Scandinavia.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.680
Now that all of our students have officially graduated,

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:37.880
would you like to see now the 142nd class

00:32:37.880 --> 00:33:15.730
of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead?

00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:18.250
Brother Sebastian Hoffman has been selected

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:27.230
to read the class letter.

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:31.470
They're governing body and battle family.

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:34.589
In one of the most beautiful inspired expressions

00:33:34.589 --> 00:33:40.069
of praise to Jehovah, King David of Old said,

00:33:40.069 --> 00:33:44.109
and now, oh our God, we thank you and praise

00:33:44.109 --> 00:33:46.549
your beautiful name.

00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:50.150
With those words, at the close of his 40-year reign,

00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:54.509
David expressed his lifelong feelings for Jehovah.

00:33:54.509 --> 00:33:59.230
And here we are, the 142nd class of Gilead,

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:03.109
at the close of our 20-week course of Bible education

00:34:03.109 --> 00:34:06.589
with those very same feelings.

00:34:06.589 --> 00:34:09.269
As we have submitted to Jehovah's molding of our hearts

00:34:09.269 --> 00:34:13.670
and minds, we have come to appreciate more than ever

00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:17.789
the beauty of the oldest personality in the universe,

00:34:17.789 --> 00:34:20.070
Jehovah's personality.

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:24.989
We have chosen it to be our own new personality.

00:34:24.989 --> 00:34:29.110
We have deeply appreciated being taught by you,

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:32.230
members of the governing body.

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:35.309
Despite your busy and demanding schedules,

00:34:35.309 --> 00:34:37.590
you made time to travel to Patterson

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:42.909
to share with us your love for Jehovah's name and for his word.

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:48.150
We heard it in your expressions, and we saw it in your eyes.

00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:51.309
The way you welcomed us into your beautiful new home

00:34:51.309 --> 00:34:54.230
in Warwick and gave us of your time

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:57.309
will live long in our memory.

00:34:57.309 --> 00:34:59.670
You strengthened our trust and respect

00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:02.469
for Jehovah's organization.

00:35:02.469 --> 00:35:07.550
Our prayer is that Jehovah give you brothers the Holy Spirit

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:11.550
and energy you need to carry out your assignments

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:14.829
as the end draws near.

00:35:14.829 --> 00:35:18.630
Throughout our schooling, we felt the power of God's word

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:21.269
at work in our students.

00:35:21.269 --> 00:35:23.829
The Bible has proven to be a mirror

00:35:23.829 --> 00:35:27.349
in which we have examined ourselves.

00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:30.389
You, our dear instructors,

00:35:30.389 --> 00:35:33.550
held that mirror up in front of us every day.

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:39.550
With kindness, love, patience and reassurance,

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:43.550
you helped us to look for attitudes, thoughts,

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:45.789
and inclinations within ourselves

00:35:45.789 --> 00:35:49.309
that are not a reflection of Jehovah.

00:35:49.309 --> 00:35:53.190
We have come to see who we really are,

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:58.190
who Jehovah wants us to be, and how we can bridge that gap.

00:35:59.389 --> 00:36:02.989
Every step of the way, you guided us with God's word

00:36:02.989 --> 00:36:05.389
and never your own opinion.

00:36:05.389 --> 00:36:08.110
What a lesson that has been to us all.

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:11.349
In the imitation of the Apostle Paul,

00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:15.110
you imparted to us not only the good news of God,

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:17.269
but also your very selves

00:36:17.269 --> 00:36:20.110
because you became beloved to you

00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:23.030
and you have become beloved to us.

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:26.789
As a class, we must acknowledge

00:36:26.789 --> 00:36:29.510
that part of the education we received

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:32.110
has been outside of the Gilead classroom.

00:36:33.269 --> 00:36:35.309
From the very first day we arrived

00:36:35.309 --> 00:36:38.070
at the Patterson Educational Center,

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:39.829
our education began.

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:44.030
The friends at reception, our hosts,

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:46.309
and the entire Bethel family

00:36:46.309 --> 00:36:49.510
immediately made us feel at home.

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:52.869
We experienced the same love and brotherly affection

00:36:52.869 --> 00:36:55.550
when we visited War Kill and Warwick.

00:36:56.710 --> 00:37:00.989
Over the last five months, we learned much observing you.

00:37:00.989 --> 00:37:04.710
How you responded to direction that you received

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:06.829
and humbly followed through.

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:10.750
How you reacted to the loss of members

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:13.550
of the Bethel family in death.

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:18.550
And how quick you were to offer comfort and assistance.

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:22.230
Thank you for your constancy

00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:26.030
in making yourselves available for us.

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:29.389
How can we ever forget the line of cars of Bethelites

00:37:29.389 --> 00:37:32.269
queuing up outside our residence building

00:37:32.269 --> 00:37:35.349
ready and willing to take us to the meetings

00:37:35.349 --> 00:37:38.469
and in the ministry every week.

00:37:38.469 --> 00:37:41.349
You really went the extra mile for us.

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:44.869
As we live this awesome place,

00:37:44.869 --> 00:37:47.909
we take with us an unforgettable

00:37:47.909 --> 00:37:51.150
and rich spiritual heritage.

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:53.989
What will we do with it?

00:37:53.989 --> 00:37:58.989
Our determination is the same as that of King David.

00:37:58.989 --> 00:38:04.989
As Sam 145 versus 1 in 2, he promised Jehovah,

00:38:04.989 --> 00:38:09.789
I will exalt you, oh my God, the King,

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:13.829
I will praise your name forever and ever.

00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:16.469
All day long, I will praise you.

00:38:16.469 --> 00:38:20.230
I will praise your name forever and ever.

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:23.190
May the blessing of Jehovah our God,

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:27.710
be upon all those who praise his name forever.

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:32.710
With all our appreciation, we love you very much.

00:38:32.710 --> 00:39:00.250
Your brothers, 142nd Class of Gilead.

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:03.329
We thank you very much for that beautiful, beautiful letter.

00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:07.409
Well, we've come to the concluding remarks

00:39:07.409 --> 00:39:08.889
of our Gilead program.

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:12.369
At the beginning, we discussed the importance

00:39:12.369 --> 00:39:15.570
of praying to Jehovah to open our eyes

00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:18.250
and help us see clearly his word.

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:21.889
You know, over time, because of imperfection,

00:39:21.889 --> 00:39:24.449
our vision tends to deteriorate.

00:39:25.889 --> 00:39:28.530
And as a result, we may have to constantly

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:30.929
be seeking a brighter light

00:39:30.929 --> 00:39:34.530
in order for us to see things more clearly.

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:39.530
Well, in the same way, as you will deal with your own imperfections,

00:39:39.889 --> 00:39:43.090
as you'll deal with the imperfections of others,

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:45.449
as you'll cope with health problems

00:39:45.449 --> 00:39:48.730
and a host of other things that will come to all of us

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:52.130
as we live in this system, you'll need to look back

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:56.650
to God's word again and again and again.

00:39:56.690 --> 00:40:00.010
In a sense to turn up the light

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:03.449
so that you can see clearly what Jehovah's will

00:40:03.449 --> 00:40:07.409
will be in so many areas of your life.

00:40:07.409 --> 00:40:10.090
And at times, you may scratch your head and say,

00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:12.650
Jehovah, I just don't know what to do.

00:40:13.650 --> 00:40:17.329
But if you do not tire of returning over

00:40:17.329 --> 00:40:21.730
and over again to God's word, he will show you the way.

00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:23.849
And the words of Joshua, chapter one,

00:40:23.849 --> 00:40:26.170
will prove to be true in your case.

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:33.889
Let's read this together in Joshua chapter one and verse seven.

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:37.730
This is what Jehovah said to Joshua,

00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:41.650
only be courageous and very strong

00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:43.769
and observe carefully the entire law

00:40:43.769 --> 00:40:46.570
that Moses, my servant, commanded you.

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:52.050
Do not deviate from it either to the right or to the left

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:56.090
so that you may act wisely wherever you go.

00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:59.449
This book of the law should not depart from your mouth

00:40:59.449 --> 00:41:03.570
and you must read in it an undertone day and night

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:07.489
in order to observe carefully all that is written in it

00:41:07.489 --> 00:41:11.409
for then your way will be successful

00:41:11.409 --> 00:41:14.650
and then you will act wisely.

00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:16.969
Have I not commanded you?

00:41:16.969 --> 00:41:20.010
Be courageous and strong.

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:23.250
Do not be struck with terror or fear

00:41:23.289 --> 00:41:27.610
for Jehovah your God is with you wherever you go.

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:33.449
Well, please know that the good wishes,

00:41:33.449 --> 00:41:38.650
the hopes, the prayers of all of us go with you today

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:41.730
for your success in your assignment

00:41:41.730 --> 00:42:02.789
and may Jehovah God be with you wherever you go.

00:42:02.789 --> 00:42:05.510
Well, I know you'll want to know about our attendance.

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:07.429
We had many sites tied in today.

00:42:07.429 --> 00:42:09.829
So here are our attendance figures.

00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:13.869
For Canada, we had 838.

00:42:13.869 --> 00:42:16.070
In the United States at Patterson,

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:21.070
we had 3,469 in Brooklyn, 328 at Fishkill, 130,

00:42:25.829 --> 00:42:30.829
at Walkill, 2,502 at Warwick, 1,571 in Curacao, 71,

00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:35.829
in Florida and Fort Lauderdale, 137 in Jamaica, 14.

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:46.789
In Miraloma, we're not certain

00:42:46.789 --> 00:42:48.789
because the program will not yet start

00:42:48.789 --> 00:42:52.550
for a few more minutes, but we'll find out in due time.

00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:55.789
And in Puerto Rico, 149.

00:42:55.789 --> 00:42:59.789
So that gives us a grand total of 10,109.

00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:14.949
Well, brothers, we've had a wonderful program today.

00:43:14.949 --> 00:43:18.269
We have one last chance to participate in the program

00:43:18.269 --> 00:43:22.789
by standing now and singing song number 150,

00:43:22.789 --> 00:43:25.110
seek God for your deliverance.

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:28.989
And then following the song, brother Herman van Selm,

00:43:28.989 --> 00:43:30.789
a helper to the writing committee,

00:43:30.789 --> 00:43:32.710
will offer our concluding prayer.

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:34.869
That's song 150.
