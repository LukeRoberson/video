00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.619
When you're young and at school, it's hard to think about the future.

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:15.779
Your entire life can be affected by what you do when you're young,

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:19.219
what you decide for your career, or also spiritually speaking.

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:26.980
Also, there's so many choices. It's hard for the person to know whether

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:30.260
this choice is right or this choice is wrong.

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:38.369
It's scary because you're in the mentality where you have to decide what to do with the rest of

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:44.450
your whole life. Young people from four different countries now discuss,

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.689
what will I do with my life?

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.620
Today's world urges young ones to have a materialistic view of life,

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.540
appealing to what the Bible calls the desire of the eyes.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.019
You want the best. As a result of this materialistic pressure,

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:22.340
many young people consider attaining financial success to be their top priority.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.939
And more than just choosing a career that they really like, they just like,

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.859
oh, that's the car I want, how do I get it?

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.859
Or that's the house I want, how do I get there? How much do I have to make?

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:40.579
They kind of equate money with success. If you have lots of money,

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.459
then you're automatically respected by society.

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.739
So if you have very little financially, you're not worth anything. You have to leave your family

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:55.780
and go to another country to earn money. Then you're going to be rich and be something in life.

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.780
Secular goals are often promoted at school by peers and by well-intentioned educators.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.460
And I see that you are in the top 5% of your class.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.300
Christian youths often feel pressured to pursue lucrative jobs and time-consuming careers.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.379
Such pressure may make it difficult to keep spiritual goals in view.

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:30.860
At school, I'm constantly told what a teacher think and mean and what is the best goal in life in their

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.580
life. Because they see your academic performance, they see what you're good at and what you're

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.460
not good at and they try, they think they're helping, they try and push you in a certain direction.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.819
If they flat out, told us, if you don't go to college, you'll be nothing, you're not going to

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.740
make any money, you're never going to make enough money to support a family. You'll never be

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:56.030
ought to get married, have kids or own a house. Education can be valuable and beneficial.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.229
In any school I wanted, it's just really confusing.

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:01.710
But how much education is necessary?

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:11.310
Christian parents can help young ones bear in mind the Bible's reminder at 1 John 217.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:19.500
Furthermore, the world is passing away and so is its desire, but he that does the will of God

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.900
remains forever. It's invading that you follow these pursuits because in the end this world is

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:32.139
going to be gone and all those accolades you get mean nothing. Once the glory and the glamour

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.900
wears off, you're left with what the meaning to your life is and a lot of people don't have a

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.379
real meaning or a real focus or a real purpose. I actually had a chance to work with people who

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:48.219
were rich and famous and I saw that they weren't really that happy. If you have family problems and

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:52.219
you don't have any kind of relationship with God, what kind of happiness is that?

00:03:55.539 --> 00:04:00.900
Yes, the Bible makes it clear that lasting happiness and fulfillment will come only if you put

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:07.460
the doing of Jehovah's will ahead of all other things. To do this means taking a very important step.

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:16.269
Jesus commanded that all his followers be baptized. Water baptism is evidence that we have

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:22.110
truly dedicated ourselves to God. It opens the door to a joyful life of service to God.

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:34.620
Some however put off taking this important step. A lot of kids like they really love Jehovah and they

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.779
want to like serve Jehovah but they only think about well what if I mess up or what if I do wrong

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:45.339
and then Jehovah's never going to forgive me or you know my parents is like to them it's like a

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:50.540
whole load of pressure. As we know this constant feeling that I must render him an account

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.379
is a little frightening. It's awesome and it's also healthy to have that fear because baptism

00:04:56.379 --> 00:05:01.579
is a big step but because it's such a big step it's the biggest step you can take to the

00:05:01.579 --> 00:05:09.060
on the path to everlasting life but does it make sense to let fear hold you back from doing what

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:15.939
is right? For example getting a driver's license there's lots of consequences you could crash

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.139
you could injure someone you love but does it stop you from getting your permit?

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.420
You're accountable to Jehovah from the moment that you know his standards regardless of whether

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.259
you're baptized or not because you know what Jehovah expects of you so from that moment on you're

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:36.910
accountable to him. Perhaps you have held back from dedicating your life to Jehovah.

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:41.149
What are some things that can help you to reach the point of baptism?

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:45.870
First you may need to prove the truth to yourself.

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:54.670
Spiritual self-examination is so important. Kind of sit back and ask yourself questions like

00:05:54.670 --> 00:06:01.790
how real is Jehovah? Even though that's a basic concept or something that's pretty basic,

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:10.350
how real is Jehovah to me? How real is the new system to me? Do I really feel that we're so close

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:16.350
to the end? I always trusted that what's in the Bible is true and it's good and it's beneficial

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:21.230
for us but there was a point in my life where I said well I really need to prove this to myself.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.069
It's not enough just to have have heard this and been taught that it's true.

00:06:28.829 --> 00:06:35.149
I used to ask myself how does Jehovah's organization know about specific dates like 1914?

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:39.550
How do they have that information?

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:46.990
What helped me to clear those doubts near the time of my baptism was researching things.

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.550
Take personal Bible studies seriously.

00:06:55.709 --> 00:06:59.550
Proving the truth to yourself can clear up any doubts that might hold you back.

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:12.939
We need regular Bible study. Study the publications. Not just the basic things but go deeper to make

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:20.259
sure that it is the truth. But you need to do more than prove the truth to yourself.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:29.579
You also need to draw close to Jehovah. For a while my peers were kind of automatic but they weren't

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.220
too meaningful. It wasn't like I was talking to a friend.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:41.420
It is something that you must work for, this appreciation for the truth. You really have to build

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:47.500
up a relationship with Jehovah. Just read the Bible daily as we're constantly instructed.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:53.899
You develop a strong relationship with Jehovah. Then later when I started praying longer,

00:07:53.899 --> 00:07:59.980
same more meaningful things. And then all of a sudden you realize I am becoming closer to Jehovah.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:05.740
It's only by studying the Bible that we can make Jehovah real to us.

00:08:06.699 --> 00:08:10.540
When he is real to us, we're going to feel motivated to worship him.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:18.779
With time and effort, you can reach the point of dedication and baptism, personal research,

00:08:19.339 --> 00:08:27.579
daily Bible reading, attendance at congregation meetings and heartfelt prayer will help you prove

00:08:27.579 --> 00:08:36.379
the truth to yourself and get to know and love Jehovah. In time, your heart will move you to make

00:08:36.379 --> 00:08:57.230
a complete dedication and lead a life of service to Jehovah God. All dedicated Christians must

00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:04.509
heed Christ's command to make disciples. As a young person, you have a unique opportunity to

00:09:04.509 --> 00:09:13.200
help others to serve God. However, not all young ones may fully enjoy the ministry.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:22.639
I found going into service every maybe once a week, once or twice a week to be very boring.

00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:28.960
You would knock on doors and no one would be home. And I felt like, well, when's our next coffee

00:09:29.039 --> 00:09:34.000
break? I was at school. I really did not like the ministry because I'd go out for an hour on

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.480
Saturday and an hour on Sunday and I would not accomplish anything. So I never felt I was getting

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:46.000
anywhere and that's why I found it boring. What are some things that can help you to learn to enjoy

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:55.580
the ministry? First, cultivate the right attitude toward the ministry. A lot of young people think

00:09:55.580 --> 00:10:01.100
that the reason we go out in the ministry is to leave literature with people. The real reason

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:07.899
that we go out is to bring praise to Jehovah God by our lips. And when you realize that,

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:12.779
it really makes the ministry more joyful. Going out in the field service isn't a burden,

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:17.179
it's a privilege. It is something that will never happen again and it's worth the effort.

00:10:18.139 --> 00:10:22.940
I speaking to some other pioneers and they said, the more you do the ministry, the more enjoyable it is.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:27.019
And that is so true. The more you go out on the service, the more calls you have,

00:10:27.019 --> 00:10:32.139
you may be blessed with a Bible study. Being on the ministry actually made me enjoy the ministry.

00:10:32.139 --> 00:10:37.019
I suddenly I was at ease, I could talk to people and I was actually having a productive ministry.

00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:42.220
So with that in mind, having the right attitude toward the ministry will help you to enjoy it.

00:10:45.659 --> 00:10:50.620
Even so, the ministry can be challenging at times. Good morning sir, my name is Dan.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:11:01.470
But what I found quite difficult was the rejection that came with the ministry and I think young

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:06.190
people in general find it quite difficult to deal with the rejection. I have a problem with

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:11.309
speaking to people, I don't know. I just can't come about just saying what I want to say.

00:11:11.309 --> 00:11:15.389
I might have this perfect presentation up in my head but then whatever comes up in my mouth is

00:11:15.389 --> 00:11:20.990
like blah, blah, blah, blah. You know, no real words. So while young kids might be scared of going

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:24.590
out there and talking to people, they might be shy, they might not like going up to people and

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:33.220
telling them. For some young ones, there is something that they may fear even more than talking to a

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:43.059
stranger. Good morning, where? Dan? What are you doing here, man? My greatest horror was meeting

00:11:43.059 --> 00:11:48.179
one of my schoolmates at a door because not everyone knew that I was a witness. I sometimes

00:11:48.179 --> 00:11:52.899
look down the street to make sure that none of them lived there and I had such strong inhibitions

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:58.340
and that blocks you. It only became better when I publicly professed my faith in Jehovah.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:04.259
Yeah, I think especially when your young fear of man plays a very big part. Not so much

00:12:04.259 --> 00:12:11.220
that the service is perhaps boring but rather daunting. Personally, I used to freeze at the thought

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:16.820
of working in an area where my school friends would be or sometimes my teachers would live.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:23.460
I just used to get this kind of, just a freezing of my heart almost and I would just want to run

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:27.940
the other way. So it's definitely, you have to get over that initial fear of man.

00:12:30.419 --> 00:12:33.860
How can you overcome your fears and develop courage to speak?

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:43.179
I think our mindset has to be right and the organisation teaches us quite well in that we

00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:46.460
bear a message from Jehovah and really they're not rejecting me.

00:12:47.419 --> 00:12:52.059
I have noticed that when you are not enjoying yourself, it's because you are not really prepared.

00:12:52.779 --> 00:12:58.460
Preparation is so key. If I don't feel comfortable at the door, then I don't do very well.

00:12:59.659 --> 00:13:05.500
In addition to proper preparation, prayer is very important, especially when you have negative

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:12.379
feelings because after all, it's Jehovah's work. It's not carried out in our own strength.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:19.740
The example of the Apostle Paul helped me. He wasn't ashamed of the good news. He preached

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:25.259
zealously and that strengthened me to lose my fear. There's just like jumping in a pool and the

00:13:25.259 --> 00:13:30.860
deep end for the first time you got to do it and a lot of times that call that you're so nervous,

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.980
that house that you're so nervous to go to, you have a really great experience.

00:13:35.659 --> 00:13:38.299
Yes, it takes courage to preach God's word.

00:13:38.539 --> 00:13:43.580
But always remember that our courage comes from Jehovah.

00:13:47.659 --> 00:13:50.779
What else is needed besides the right attitude and courage?

00:13:50.779 --> 00:13:53.980
I'm going to help you. Good morning. How are you? I'm here with my friend to run the

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:57.820
Hobus Witnesses? Yes, Jehovah's Witnesses. You know, one thing I've always wondered is where

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:01.580
Jehovah's Witnesses get that date? 1914. Where do you get it? All alone.

00:14:05.039 --> 00:14:09.279
To enjoy the ministry, you also need to develop a measure of skill.

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:16.190
I think one of the biggest problems with using the ministry and finding it boring is that they've

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:20.830
never been trained. They go out there and they read the cover of the magazine and say,

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:26.509
would you like to read this magazine? It's on. And that's all they do. They never do return visits.

00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:30.909
They don't experience Bible studies. And that's really where the joy of the ministry is.

00:14:30.909 --> 00:14:34.590
I remember one of the sisters encouraging me to go street ministering. And I must have

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:38.269
gone out street ministering, I don't know, four months before I actually plucked up the courage to

00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:42.669
speak to a person. And she was like, you know, you've got to talk to people. I'm not going to walk

00:14:42.669 --> 00:14:48.269
around here with you. She forced me to talk to people. And it's only when you get into doing that,

00:14:48.269 --> 00:14:53.070
that you can actually get a bit of confidence and you learn to trust in Jehovah and do some more

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:57.789
preparation. And then it starts to work. But loving the ministry doesn't come first. It comes with

00:14:57.789 --> 00:15:02.909
the effort. You have to take the initiative and work with people like pioneers. They have

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:08.190
experienced in the full-time service. Ask, how do they do it? Join the pioneers of this program.

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:12.669
That is what helped me working with some of the mature friends who have been pioneering for years.

00:15:14.269 --> 00:15:17.549
Well, why don't you type in the last days? Let's see what you come up with.

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:21.950
With the help of your parents or an experienced publisher or a pioneer,

00:15:22.669 --> 00:15:27.870
learn how to do deep research into God's word. This can broaden your knowledge and help you to

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:33.309
gain confidence as a teacher. So we have talked about 1914 last week. You know, I'll do

00:15:33.309 --> 00:15:37.309
to do some research. And there's several lines of evidence that the Bible points to 1914.

00:15:38.029 --> 00:15:43.230
The first is Jesus' prophecy, found in Matthew chapter 24. Maybe I could show you in your

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:48.909
personal copy of the Bible. Becoming skilled in using the Bible itself can also build your confidence

00:15:48.909 --> 00:15:54.669
and increase your joy in the ministry. Read verse three. It reminds me of the scripture that

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:59.629
God needs to live, exhaust power. And that's what it feels like when you're talking to someone

00:15:59.629 --> 00:16:04.110
and you bring out God's word that Bible will show them a scripture and see their eyes light up.

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:10.429
I also discovered that service simply is nicer. You feel that you really give something to the people.

00:16:10.429 --> 00:16:15.149
But the feeling of actually being able to find a scripture that would then be able to maybe change

00:16:15.149 --> 00:16:22.429
someone's mind or show them the truth is an incredible feeling. Thanks, Mr. John. See you next week.

00:16:22.429 --> 00:16:27.389
By developing the right attitude and the courage to speak and becoming skilled and speaking to

00:16:27.389 --> 00:16:34.429
others, you will no longer find the ministry to be so daunting. In fact, it is something you will

00:16:34.429 --> 00:16:44.580
learn to enjoy. So you notice what the verse there says, and this good news of the kingdom will

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:50.580
be preached in all the inhabitants of this. The Apostle Paul said, to what extent we have made progress,

00:16:50.659 --> 00:16:57.379
let us go on walking orderly in this same routine. Pioneering offers you many opportunities to

00:16:57.379 --> 00:17:04.500
advance spiritually. Pioneering can help you to sharpen spiritual skills, your ability to use the

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:12.259
Bible, your ability to teach. Pioneering also allows you to enjoy association with other zealous

00:17:12.259 --> 00:17:23.549
preachers. Nevertheless, some may hesitate to enter this door of service. I think some

00:17:23.549 --> 00:17:27.309
youngsters think that you have to be cut out for Pioneer and you have to be made for it. You have

00:17:27.309 --> 00:17:32.190
to love the ministry right from the start. You go out with other pioneers and they're doing all

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:38.269
these nice presentations at the door, conducting all these Bible studies, and I felt like I didn't

00:17:38.269 --> 00:17:42.910
know enough scriptures. I didn't know the Bible like they did. It seemed like their hands, which

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:49.150
is fine stuff. I didn't even know that was there. So I just didn't feel like I knew enough. I felt

00:17:50.109 --> 00:17:56.430
like how could I be a pioneer? I don't know anything. Many think that pioneers can't do anything.

00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:00.430
Pioneers are narrow-minded. They are saints. They have to be perfect.

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:07.549
Be assured, however, that you do not need to be perfect or unusually gifted to enter the full-time

00:18:07.549 --> 00:18:15.710
service. So I said, wow, they can do it so well. Why can't I? They know the Bible by heart,

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:20.430
but now I simply know that good preparation is important and that everybody can manage to give

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:25.549
a good witness which Jehovah's help. Not every pioneer first knows every scripture. They don't

00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:30.430
know how to answer every question, but as years go by, as months go by, you learn how to look up

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:34.910
those scriptures, find those scriptures, and you become better in your ministry. Don't compare yourself

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:38.990
to the pioneer who's been out in the ministry for 30 years. Measure yourself from when you start

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:43.309
pioneering, maybe after a year, reevaluate, and you'll be amazed how much progress you've made.

00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:50.509
Nevertheless, some may still hold back from full-time service because of economic concerns,

00:18:50.509 --> 00:18:59.359
or because they feel that priority should be given to education. How can you meet these challenges?

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:09.980
First, by cultivating trust in Jehovah to provide for you. Jesus told his disciples not to be

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:16.059
anxious over material things, but to seek first God's kingdom and to trust in God to provide for them.

00:19:16.059 --> 00:19:22.539
If we really trust him, all these other things will be added to us. He will never let us suffer

00:19:22.539 --> 00:19:29.019
necessity or want because we have chosen to serve him. I come from a single parent home, so my

00:19:29.019 --> 00:19:34.140
concern was really to help out my mom. And she was like, I don't know why you worried about it.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:39.819
And she's like, Jehovah has provided for us through all this time. If you pioneer, we'll have

00:19:39.819 --> 00:19:45.900
you more blessings. Even so, it is wise to apply Jesus counsel to maintain

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:52.380
a simple eye. You just have to be practical. Sometimes when you go shopping, you just have to say,

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:56.779
do I really need this or do I just want it? The service and you have to realize that it's a simple

00:19:56.779 --> 00:20:05.099
life and full-time service is a sacrifice. First Timothy 6, 6 through 8 talks about being content

00:20:05.099 --> 00:20:14.029
with basic things, our sustenance and covering. While full-time evangelizers must trust in Jehovah,

00:20:14.589 --> 00:20:20.269
they must still work to support themselves. In preparation for a career and full-time service,

00:20:20.269 --> 00:20:24.190
it may be possible to select courses in school that will teach you a trade.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:33.619
While planning for your education, it is important to keep your focus on spiritual goals.

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:42.930
I think possibly the key is to trust in Jehovah because if you're constantly feeling that

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:47.089
if you don't get this qualification, that qualification and the one that comes after,

00:20:47.089 --> 00:20:50.930
you're not going to get a job that's good enough to support you pioneering, you won't get that

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:55.890
job that's good enough to support you pioneering. A lot of pioneers have spoken to have fallen into

00:20:55.890 --> 00:21:01.569
their jobs, or they've started off in something small and found that there was a way to get into

00:21:01.569 --> 00:21:09.410
something better. My parents supported me as a pioneer, but then I took a technical course in

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:15.890
architecture. Things didn't work out very well because of my work schedule, which messed up my

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:24.609
pioneering. Then I developed a skill that I didn't even know I had, handicrafts. Jehovah

00:21:24.609 --> 00:21:30.690
blessed me so much that now I'm earning more in handicrafts than I would have if I had stayed

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:39.650
in architecture. I went to a vocational high school in architectural drafting. I became friends

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:45.490
with a brother who was an architect and when I graduated, he invited me to work in the firm that

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:51.569
he was in. I learned a lot of the things that I know just from working there. I work as a secretary

00:21:51.569 --> 00:21:56.130
and I do medical transcription. Since I went to a vocational high school, they trained me in office

00:21:56.130 --> 00:22:01.329
work. My senior year, I took works that day where you go to school half a day and I worked construction.

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:06.369
I did kitchen and bathroom modeling. I learned a lot about the trade, and then when I moved

00:22:06.369 --> 00:22:12.769
the way, I got a job working on a retail store selling building materials. I'm a dental assistant.

00:22:12.849 --> 00:22:17.970
I'm the job training and then in the state that I live in, you can go to school and get your

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:22.849
license, but it's only like one day a week and it worked out really well. I've heard quite a lot of

00:22:22.849 --> 00:22:28.130
people who are pioneers, they've got the perfect job, the most wonderful job, but I've never actually

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:34.210
had that. The job I'm in at the moment, I don't particularly enjoy, but I've been there for four

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:40.849
years and it allows me to pioneer. When we trust in Jehovah and recognise that he's the one that's

00:22:40.849 --> 00:22:46.930
going to make the way for us, then we put everything that we have into his hands and he always directs us

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:53.490
in the right way. What though if circumstances do not allow one to enter full-time service?

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:59.250
Jehovah knows of circumstances, not all of us can be pioneers now, but if we do, I'm very

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:05.890
best. Jehovah always remember that. We know that our worth before Jehovah is in measured in terms of

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:13.410
the number of hours that we attain or the results. Numbers don't matter to Jehovah, it's the motivation,

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:22.930
it's what we have in our heart. So what will you do with your life? An open door leading to many

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:52.660
avenues of service stands before you. Whatever your circumstances make serving Jehovah your main

00:23:52.660 --> 00:24:01.339
goal in life. Have as full as share in the service as your circumstances allow. Set goals for

00:24:01.339 --> 00:24:10.299
yourself. Constantly seek ways to improve the quality of your service to God. If you make serving

00:24:10.299 --> 00:24:18.380
Jehovah your goal in life, you will truly find joy and fulfillment.
