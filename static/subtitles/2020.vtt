00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:06.379
an introduction to the book of Proverbs.

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:10.380
King Solomon composed the majority of the Proverbs.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.380
Solomon became King of Israel in 1037 BCE,

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.379
and Jehovah gave him extraordinary wisdom.

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:23.379
Most of Solomon's Proverbs, or Wise Sains,

00:00:23.379 --> 00:00:25.379
were written down during his reign.

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:29.629
However, it seems that the entire collection of Proverbs

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:32.630
was compiled into one book,

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.630
sometime around 717 BCE in Jerusalem,

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.140
before the end of King Hezekiah's reign.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.140
The book of Proverbs provides divine guidance

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.140
for virtually every aspect of daily life,

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.140
from business dealings to family matters.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.140
As such, it helps prepare us for life under God's kingdom.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:03.770
Proverbs contains 31 chapters and may be divided into five sections.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.769
The first three sections are attributed to Solomon.

00:01:07.769 --> 00:01:11.769
Chapters 1 to 9 make up section 1,

00:01:11.769 --> 00:01:16.769
which consists of short discourses containing a father's advice to a son.

00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:22.769
The father warns the son about the bad results of acting on wrong desires,

00:01:22.769 --> 00:01:27.769
while emphasizing the good results of trusting in God's wisdom.

00:01:27.769 --> 00:01:30.769
Section 2, called the Proverbs of Solomon,

00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:34.769
and section 3, called the Proverbs of Solomon,

00:01:34.769 --> 00:01:36.769
transcribed by King Hezekiah's men,

00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:42.769
both present concise sains designed to make the reader think.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:46.769
Many of these Proverbs contrast the traits we should avoid

00:01:46.769 --> 00:01:48.769
with the ones we should cultivate.

00:01:48.769 --> 00:01:54.769
Many contrasts are used, such as laziness versus diligence,

00:01:54.769 --> 00:01:58.769
and selfishness versus generosity.

00:01:58.769 --> 00:02:03.769
These short parallels are instructive and easy to follow.

00:02:03.769 --> 00:02:09.770
These two sections contain more than 500 of Solomon's Proverbs.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:16.770
Did you know The Bible tells us that King Solomon spoke 3,000 Proverbs

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.770
and composed 1,000 five songs.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.050
Chapter 30 makes up the fourth section and was written by Ager.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.050
He uses comparisons of four to help us reflect on Godly wisdom,

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.050
such as four things that are small yet instinctively wise.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.050
The final chapter was composed by Lemuel.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.050
Some believe that Lemuel is another name for Solomon.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.050
This chapter contains a description of a capable wife.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.050
It points out her qualities and the positive effects she has on her family.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.050
Godly wisdom must be sought after like hidden treasure,

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.050
but its value is eternal, unlike that of silver and gold.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.050
As you read Proverbs, note how it shows the benefits

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.050
of trusting in God's wisdom instead of our own.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.050
How it identifies traits we should avoid and those we should cultivate

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.050
and how it teaches us to live under the rule of God's kingdom.
