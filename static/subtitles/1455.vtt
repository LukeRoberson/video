00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:07.879
The Correspondence Department at World Headquarters is heavily involved in directing individuals

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:13.599
from all over the world to meetings and publications in their native tongue.

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:47.090
While you and I are out in the service, this is what takes place behind the scenes.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:54.929
The zealous preaching work carried out by Jehovah's Witnesses touches the lives of millions.

00:00:54.929 --> 00:01:06.829
The message and publications they share bring relief to a weary heart, reach beyond the

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:50.500
boundaries of language and class.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.819
Bring hope to the hopeless.

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:57.420
So what do you think the future holds?

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.420
I don't know.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.019
I'd like to think things will get better.

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:01.019
You know what?

00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:02.019
They're calling me.

00:02:02.019 --> 00:02:03.019
I have to go.

00:02:03.019 --> 00:02:04.019
Okay.

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:05.019
Okay.

00:02:05.019 --> 00:02:06.019
Thank you very much.

00:02:06.019 --> 00:02:08.620
Thank you.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:33.000
Understanding to those searching draws parents closer to their children.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.439
Every month, thousands of pieces of correspondence are received from around the world.

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:42.919
Upon arrival, mail is sorted and delivered for processing.

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:48.439
It's exciting to receive letters in so many different languages.

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:56.439
Since many letters must be translated, I use various samples to identify the language.

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:01.599
Grace's letter, like many others, can be quite challenging to identify.

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.479
This is Ebo.

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:11.400
So her letter is prepared to be sent electronically to the Nigeria branch for translation.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:19.020
When a translated letter is received, its purpose is brought to light.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:25.099
Grace was so moved by the offer that she requested more literature.

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:30.460
We can forward Grace's information to the nearest Ebo-speaking publisher.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:37.300
Soon, she will receive not only literature in her language, but a personal visit.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.620
Hey, Mercy, how are you?

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.620
I'm fine.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.620
How you doing?

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.620
Excellent.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.620
You know, I have a follow-up form for you.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.620
Someone that speaks Ebo.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.620
I think they live in your neighborhood.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.620
Hi.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.620
Hi.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.620
I would like a Bible study.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.620
So your first name is Alex?

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:56.930
I just have a follow-up form for an interested person I met in public witnessing.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.930
Every day, elders use JW.org to send please follow-up forms to the US branch.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.930
These forms contain information that help us fulfill the request of spiritually hungry ones.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.930
Alex's address is matched to a database of congregations within the US branch territory.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:22.930
An electronic form is then created and sent to the corresponding congregations JW.org account.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.930
Before long, a grateful publisher will be privileged to provide Alex his Bible study.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:35.180
Every month, hundreds of letters are received from inmates in correctional facilities,

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.180
like Paul, who has requested a personal copy of the Bible.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.310
A personalized entry is made for him in our program.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.310
This entry includes information about the facility in which he is incarcerated,

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.310
like what literature can be sent and whether they allow visitors.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.310
Paul's request and an address label are sent electronically to the shipping department at Waukel,

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.310
where it is prepared for mailing.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:08.120
In an effort to provide Paul with further assistance,

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.120
a follow-up letter is sent to the closest contact congregation so he can be visited in the near future.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.180
My name is Louis.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.180
Good to meet you.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.180
My name is Paul.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:31.180
Amisha is one of thousands who have used JW.org to request a Bible study in their own language.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.180
Amisha's request is reviewed for accuracy and completeness.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:41.180
We learn that she is a student at Burton University who prefers literature in Bengali.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:47.180
Her address is confirmed and the corresponding congregation number is added to the form.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.180
Then an electronic referral is sent for follow-up.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:56.180
You can imagine the surprise when she is contacted by witnesses who speak her native language.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:06.980
That looks beautiful.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:16.149
Numerous pieces of correspondence are received for the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:25.410
Included in these are many heartfelt expressions of gratitude.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:32.410
These letters are organized, scanned, and sent to the corresponding committees of the governing body.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:47.959
We can assure you that these expressions of appreciation bring our dear brothers great joy.

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:49.959
I am an adult.

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:52.959
I will never give up.

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:55.959
I will never give up.

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:03.959
When you look at this book, you can see that the title of the book is the book of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:07:03.959 --> 00:07:05.959
You can see that the book is on the screen.

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:20.709
Every year, thousands of spiritually hungry ones come to know Jehovah and become his witnesses.

00:07:20.709 --> 00:07:25.709
You are them to find yourself as one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:07:25.709 --> 00:07:44.180
It is truly our joy to provide timely assistance that can have a life-changing effect for so many.
