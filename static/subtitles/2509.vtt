00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.620
Sometimes in service, we meet people who don't speak the language we do.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.130
Yes, I'm a Shema.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.129
Wouldn't it be cool if we had a translator robot that could help us?

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.129
Engalting!

00:00:20.129 --> 00:00:26.140
Oh, we can't use machines to preach.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.140
But we have something better.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.140
J.W. language.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.140
You can learn to speak to anyone with this.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.140
First, pick the language you already speak.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.140
Second, choose a language you want to learn.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.140
Third, find preaching skills.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.140
What do you need?

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.140
Greetings and introductions.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.140
Good, because we need to know how to say hi to them, right?

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.140
So let's look at this one.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.140
This is so cool.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.140
Wow, I can talk to Chinese people.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.939
It's going service.

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.319
What's the matter?

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:13.319
Hello.

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:15.319
I'm so happy to see you.

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:17.319
Wow!
