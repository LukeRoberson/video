00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:15.509
Observeers find it difficult even to get near the nimble mountain goat.

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.100
What accounts for this?

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.100
Their hooves are designed with two toes that can be spread wide apart.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:49.259
This feature enables mountain goats to run, jump and feed between narrow ledges.

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:53.259
They can maintain their footing on a near vertical incline.

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:59.500
Researchers have tried to apply these design features to advanced footwear.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:23.379
With only limited success, a horse can gallop at speeds up to 50 kilometres or 30 miles per hour.

00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:29.700
Even more impressive is how efficiently the horse expands energy.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.700
The secret is in its legs.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.709
Like a spring, a horse's leg absorbs energy.

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:43.709
As its leg leaves the ground, that energy is released.

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:49.500
Specialised muscles act as shock absorbers.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.500
Engineers are trying to imitate this design but are finding it a challenge.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:26.400
During an eagle's flight, the feathers on the tips of its wings are practically vertical.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.930
This configuration gives maximum lift with minimum wing length.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:41.930
Engineers have studied such soaring birds as eagles with a view to designing more efficient aircraft.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:52.930
The introduction of modified wing design that includes winglets has improved aircraft performance by as much as 15%.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.930
Plains can now fly farther and carry more while saving fuel.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:10.930
In the decade following the introduction of upturned wingtips, airlines worldwide saved 7,600 million litres or two billion gallons of jet fuel.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.930
But the eagle's amazing design is not limited to flight.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:31.620
As the eagle descends upon its prey, its eyes continuously adjust to maintain sharp focus throughout the approach.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.620
What man-made camera comes even close to the stability of rapid refocus.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:04:02.139
The behemoth mentioned in Job is generally identified as the hippopotamus.

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:14.139
A full grown hippo may be as large as 15 feet or 4 to 5 meters long and weigh around 8,000 pounds or 3,600 kilograms.

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:21.800
Its bones, particularly the vertebrae, form a strong rigid structure.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:28.800
Its ribs and thick height protect it as it navigate such areas as rocky river beds.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:38.860
You don't have to have bones like a hippo to appreciate their strength.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.860
Bone is an essential part of countless living organisms.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:05:04.810
Researchers say that bones are constructed in exactly the same way that reinforced concrete is constructed.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:14.810
The steel of reinforced concrete provides the tensile strength, while the cement, sand and rock provide the compressional strength.

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:24.819
However, the compressional strength of bone is greater than that of even the best reinforced concrete.

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:31.949
Bone is superior to concrete in many other ways.

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:38.949
It responds to hormones that affect its growth and development and is even able to repair itself.

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:47.699
Also, like muscle, it slowly grows stronger as the load on it increases.

00:05:47.699 --> 00:06:09.329
Leviathan, likely the crocodile, has an enormously powerful bite.

00:06:09.329 --> 00:06:22.579
Some have a bite nearly three times more powerful than that of a lion, yet the crocodile's jaw is also more sensitive than the human fingertip.

00:06:22.579 --> 00:06:29.579
It is covered with thousands of sense organs that come out of holes in the skull.

00:06:29.579 --> 00:06:56.060
This design allows a mother to pick up her babies and gently carry them in her mouth.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:08.980
Without a doubt, God's invisible qualities are clearly seen in the things he made.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:21.870
We can also learn much from the other animal creation mentioned in Job, the wild bull, the stalk and the ostrich.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:38.509
Why not study these animals during family worship and see what more can be learned about Jehovah's qualities?
