WEBVTT

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:13.460
Well, I don't have to tell you that many people today are totally self-absorbed.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.699
They spend a lot of time on the Internet, a lot of time on social media talking about

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.980
themselves, talking about their own accomplishments.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.859
And that's in contrast with Jehovah's people, because Jehovah's people are concerned with

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.740
giving God glory.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.539
And this is in line with what we read at Psalm 96 and verse 8.

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:45.179
Now this is the only text we're going to read during this talk, and I am going to have

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:48.619
a look at three words in the phrase that we're going to be reading.

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:50.179
So please let's look it up.

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:52.820
I'll give you a moment to find it.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.460
If you're like me sometimes it takes a little while to find things in the Bible.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.380
Psalm 96 and verse 8.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.299
And it's just the first clause, the first phrase that we're going to look at.

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:16.500
It says, give Jehovah the glory, do his name.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.420
Give Jehovah the glory, do his name.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:30.060
Now what were the circumstances during which these words were first spoken?

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:39.180
They were first spoken on a very happy occasion, a special spiritual occasion.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.500
They were first spoken.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.140
They're part of the song, and that song was first composed by David when he was bringing

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.700
the arc of the covenant back to Jerusalem.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.900
So you can imagine the joy with which these words were spoken.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:02.060
And finally, eventually that song became part of the Theocratic songbook that the Israelites

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.379
used when they were praising Jehovah.

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:12.379
Now we're going to focus on three words in this phrase that I just read.

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:17.620
Three, do and name.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.379
Give Jehovah the glory, do his name.

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:31.460
Now when you think of the word glory, what comes to your mind?

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:37.060
If you're like me, you're probably think of a blinding light, a light that's so intense

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.539
that you have to shield your eyes.

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:48.659
You might think of the words of the Apostle John when he wrote that God is light.

00:02:48.659 --> 00:03:00.860
And so you might ask yourself, how could an imperfect person like me give God glory?

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.819
Well, it all comes together when we appreciate what the scriptures mean by glory.

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.500
Now let's be real simple.

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:24.199
In the scriptures means anything that makes someone or something impressive.

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:25.599
I'm going to repeat that.

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:37.080
In the scriptures, glory means anything that makes someone or something impressive.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.759
Now with that simple definition in mind,

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.719
we realize that we can ring glory to God in our preaching work.

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:53.240
Well we tell others how wonderful Jehovah is, how impressive he is.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.120
We have many reasons to boast in our God.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.840
Our God is merciful and compassionate.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.560
Our God is empathetic when we feel hurt.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.719
He feels hurt.

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:07.759
Our God is humble.

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:16.399
He shows concern for widows and orphans and others who are often neglected by society.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:21.920
We also bring a glory to Jehovah when we give him credit for our accomplishments.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.639
David did that.

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.639
Remember what David said?

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:31.839
By God's power, I can scale a wall.

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:37.240
But we can give glory to God without saying a word.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.000
Think of the heavens.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.920
What does the Bible say about the heavens?

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.480
There is no speech.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.639
And there are no words.

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:53.600
Their voice is not heard, yet what does the Psalm continue to say?

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.040
The heavens are declaring the glory of God.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.759
We can't help but be impressed by Jehovah's creation.

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.399
Well so much for glory.

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:13.800
We give Jehovah the glory due his name.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.879
Now we give someone his due when we give him what's rightfully his.

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:23.560
And Jehovah has an absolute right to receive glory from men.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:32.480
We're reminded of what the 24 elders said as recorded at Revelation 4 and verse 11.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:40.339
They said, you are worthy Jehovah our God to receive the glory.

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:46.220
Give Jehovah the glory due his name.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.980
What about God's name?

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:53.500
Well, we were thrilled when we first learned that God has a name and that prompted

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.459
some of us to study the Bible and come into the truth.

00:05:57.459 --> 00:06:03.500
Now if learning that God has a name had that effect on you, don't you think that it could

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.420
also have that effect on people in your territory?

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.779
Have you asked people in your territory recently what do you like to see God's name in the

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:16.819
Bible or have you ever seen God's name in the Bible?

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:21.100
That could lead to some very interesting discussions.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.139
A missionary serving in a country where most of the people believe in God.

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:27.939
They're either Catholic or Muslim but they all believe in God.

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:30.459
They don't know much about him.

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:32.779
But I like the way he reasons with them.

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:37.899
He says, when you want to become friends with someone, the first thing you do is introduce

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:39.220
yourself.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:44.259
You tell him your name, he tells you his, and you become friends.

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:46.899
What we all want to be friends of God.

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:54.819
So a good first step is to find out his name and then he reads the God's name in the

00:06:54.819 --> 00:06:56.620
Bible.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:02.220
We give God glory when we defend his name and his reputation.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.819
Well what does the name mean?

00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:09.300
Well many scholars say it means he causes to become.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:15.779
And we know that Jehovah can cause us to become whatever he wants to be.

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:23.740
So think about what we heard earlier in this program today.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:30.220
If he wants us to become a missionary, if he wants us to work in construction, if he

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:36.860
wants us to be a special pioneer or a servant at Bethel, a Jehovah can give us the strength.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.660
He can give us the ability to do that.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:44.100
And all we have to do is put our trust in him.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:50.220
Now like the heavens, we can sometimes give God glory without saying a word.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.220
How?

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.819
By our fine conduct.

00:07:54.819 --> 00:07:59.220
How many unbelievers have come into the truth sometimes after being violently opposed

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:05.420
for years because of the conduct of their Christian mate and children?

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:10.339
How many unbelievers have been impressed by the way we take care of one another and others

00:08:10.339 --> 00:08:12.779
when disaster strikes?

00:08:12.779 --> 00:08:17.300
So we think about the words of Jesus and the sermon on the mount.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:25.899
When people see our fine works, they give glory to our Father in heaven.

00:08:25.899 --> 00:08:30.339
Jehovah is also glorified when his servants respond to the leading of his spirit in their

00:08:30.339 --> 00:08:36.700
Christian life when they become more humble, more loving, more trustworthy.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:43.740
Now, if you're an appointed man, have the elders found you to be more reasonable, more

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:48.299
tactful, more yielding over the years?

00:08:48.299 --> 00:08:54.220
When they see those changes in us, our brothers and sisters don't fail to give credit

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:59.019
to Jehovah God and Jehovah God is praised.

00:08:59.019 --> 00:09:06.899
So in 2025, let's give serious thought to ways we can give God glory.

00:09:06.899 --> 00:09:13.500
And to remind us, those words, the words of Psalm 96.8 are going to be posted in our

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.539
kingdom halls as our eurotech.

00:09:16.539 --> 00:09:18.980
So what's the eurotech again?

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:40.909
Psalm 96.8, give Jehovah the glory, do his name.

00:09:40.909 --> 00:09:45.549
Now there's a poem entitled Give Jehovah Glory.

00:09:45.549 --> 00:09:48.710
And I'm going to read it to you.

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:53.549
We don't usually, we don't do poetry in our publications because it's too hard to translate.

00:09:53.549 --> 00:09:56.710
But this is a good one and I'm going to read it to you.

00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:02.799
It's entitled Give Jehovah Glory.

00:10:02.799 --> 00:10:09.960
Who is like you, O Jehovah, high on your heavenly throne?

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:16.320
How could I ever repay you for all of the love you have shown?

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:22.080
When I look up to the heavens, power and glory I see.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:30.039
Who then am I, O Jehovah, that you would show favor to me?

00:10:30.039 --> 00:10:33.039
My life is yours, O Jehovah.

00:10:33.039 --> 00:10:35.720
May all I do bring you praise.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:40.919
Gladly I'll speak of your goodness and tell of your glorious ways.

00:10:40.919 --> 00:10:47.679
Serving you, great God, Jehovah, fills me with honor and pride.

00:10:47.679 --> 00:10:54.960
You are my strength and my glory forever may you be my guide.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:11:00.759
I have my own emotions and valleys below me, sun, moon and stars up above, fill me with

00:11:00.759 --> 00:11:07.559
joy and with wonder and show me your unending love.

00:11:07.559 --> 00:11:14.279
Majesty, wisdom and beauty, these are the things that I see.

00:11:14.279 --> 00:11:36.100
How could I not give you glory for making it all come to be?

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:46.220
Those words were composed for a very happy occasion, a spiritual occasion.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:55.220
They're part of a song, an original song that was composed specially for this annual

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.220
meeting.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:00.750
And guess what?

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.429
Guess what?

00:12:03.429 --> 00:12:24.539
We are going to sing that song at the conclusion of this meeting.

00:12:24.539 --> 00:12:27.019
I said to the governing body, are you sure?

00:12:27.019 --> 00:12:36.139
And they said, oh yes, they have tremendous confidence in your musical ability.

00:12:36.139 --> 00:12:42.460
Now just so you know, the governing body has decided that from now on, a new original

00:12:42.460 --> 00:13:00.629
song based on the Eurotex is going to be featured at each annual meeting.

00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:07.389
The brothers in music services are busy working on the one for 2026.

00:13:07.389 --> 00:13:12.950
Now during the past two months, the music team and translation services all around the

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:19.950
world have been working feverishly to translate, record and mix the song.

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:28.990
And as a result of their efforts, when this talk is released on October the 14th, the song

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:50.980
will be released simultaneously with the English in over 400 languages.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:57.179
So let's see how those words sound when they're put to music.

00:13:57.179 --> 00:14:01.179
Now remember, we're going to be singing this song at the conclusion of the meeting and

00:14:01.179 --> 00:14:06.299
we don't want anybody just moving the lips with no sound coming out.

00:14:06.299 --> 00:14:11.100
That's, there is a reason why we call it a song.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.340
So pay attention and enjoy.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:19:24.940
Give Jehovah glory.

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:28.299
You sure are an encouraging group with all this applause.

00:19:28.299 --> 00:19:32.519
You know, that's why we're going over time.

00:19:32.519 --> 00:19:39.680
Well now if you're listening in your room, when the time comes to sing, be sure to join

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.680
in.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.000
Remember, the Lord is listening.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.279
So don't think that just because you're in private that you shouldn't join in.

00:19:47.279 --> 00:19:53.200
But we all want to join in and this is a way we can give additional glory to Jehovah.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:20:01.440
So in 2025, let's pay special attention to ways we can give God glory.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.960
He certainly is worthy.
