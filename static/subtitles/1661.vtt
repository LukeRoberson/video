00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:10.779
When this was recorded, Brother Bert Mann from North Bend, Washington, was 91 years old.

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:17.750
My parents died when I was 12 years old.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:25.750
I slept on the cold streets of Chicago, ate out of garbage cans in order to survive.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:38.969
At age 18, I thought my escape was the army, but the war left me nothing but night.

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:46.100
Then I became a workaholic.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.100
I wasn't there for my family, and I regretted to this day.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:01:00.859
I came to North Bend at the age of 69, and I became a walker.

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:06.859
And as I would walk, I got to know people.

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:15.299
And one day, a car pulls up alongside of me, and they offered me some literature.

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.299
And I said, well, what is this all about?

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.299
What was your home and witnesses?

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:28.299
I immediately said no, because I heard negative things about the witnesses, and I believed them.

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:34.299
But they were persistent, and they were there every week, as I walked.

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.299
Once a week, they'd offered me the literature.

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.299
And I always said no.

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.299
Finally, this is five years went by.

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.299
I said, quit being a stubborn mule.

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.299
At least read it.

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:56.299
I put the literature down, and at the back side of the literature, the watchtower,

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.299
and bowl of letters, which would light a free Bible study.

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.299
Caught my eye.

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.299
Being a fugal guy from the old school, I never got anything for nothing.

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.300
I am going for it.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.379
The brother I studied with was very patient.

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:20.379
And he said, now you can learn the truth, and you can be forgiven.

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:24.379
And I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.379
I knew, I made a chance to redeem myself.

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:38.580
Well, I certainly wanted, in the worst way, after learning the truth,

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.580
I became baptized at 87 years old.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.759
In my wildest dreams, all my friends can't believe it.

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:50.759
Nobody can.

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:54.759
Bert, he's a witness, and he's baptized.

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:58.759
Wow, if he can do it, anybody could.

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:01.759
I'm so grateful I have a new life.

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:03.759
I have an outlook now.

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:09.759
At my age, there's nothing to look at or the four walls.

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:11.759
But now I have brothers and sisters.

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:13.759
I have family.

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:15.759
I have family around the world.

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:19.759
I can go anywhere and be welcome.

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:21.759
I'm in my third year of pioneering.

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:25.759
What a blessing it's been.

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:32.259
I have finally become something.

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:38.259
At 91, I'm teaching other people now what the little that I know.

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:43.900
Thank you, Jehovah.
