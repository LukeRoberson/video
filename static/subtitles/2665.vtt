00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.269
When we're growing up, we all have to make decisions.

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:12.429
We all have to choose which path we will take.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:25.949
My parents raised me as one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:33.259
Our ministry, teaching others about the Bible, has always been an important part of my life.

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:39.820
When I was a teenager, I wanted to expand my ministry to take it to the next level.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.380
There were friends in my local congregation who had gone to foreign countries and helped teach people the Bible.

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:52.299
Reading experiences from the yearbook motivated me that that was a goal that I wanted to set for myself.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:01.020
After a few years of careful planning and saving, I was finally able to travel to Malawi.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.219
The people there had such a high respect for the Bible. You could talk to someone walking down the street

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.260
or living in a small house or even a mansion.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.219
And all were interested in what the Bible had to say.

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:23.980
This one time in Malawi, one of the workers invited us in.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.659
Then the head of the house invited all the workers, family members,

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.140
came into the living room, sat down and he said, okay, what would you like to tell us from the Bible?

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.620
And I'm just sitting there like, wow, this is incredible.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.310
It was so encouraging to be able to share Bible truths.

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:55.620
Some days you'd be out for 12 hours writing a home on the bus,

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.099
desk coming in the windows, sharing a seat with four people.

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.299
Even sometimes a chicken would be on your lap.

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.419
You'd get off the bus and you'd have to walk two miles home and you're just exhausted.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:13.139
But you couldn't help but have a grin on your face because you felt like you accomplished something that day

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:15.379
and that you were doing the best work you could possibly do.

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:20.740
So many good things yet to be done.

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:26.419
It wasn't easy leaving home, learning a new language or even a new culture.

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:32.500
But because of those experiences, it taught me to rely more on Jehovah.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.979
Sometimes when we're younger, we kind of get really involved in whatever environment we're in.

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:54.819
When you step outside of that box and you experience something that you've never handled before,

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.740
it helps you to grow as a person and serve to open ways you never thought were possible.

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:15.819
My name is Cameron. I'm one of Jehovah's Witnesses and I have the best life ever.
