00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:06.259
Unless you get circumcised, you cannot get saved.

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:13.599
Well, that's a very strong statement, especially being made almost 14 years after Jehovah

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:20.300
had made clear that he had accepted uncircumcised Gentiles as anointed Christians.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.859
So let's discuss two lessons that we can learn from this account.

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:32.929
A first lesson, do we place our own conditions on others to be saved?

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:36.329
Even how the Gentile Christians felt.

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.530
Brothers associated with the governing body of that time said, unless you get circumcised,

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.210
you cannot get saved.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.329
As a Gentile brother, you had made great changes in your life and morals to become a Christian.

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.210
You gave up the worship of pagan gods and the lifestyle that was associated with that

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.289
to be a Christian.

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.969
Maybe you endured a lot of family opposition and now you're being told you're not doing

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.329
enough.

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:10.709
It must have been very discouraging for them, especially if they already had feelings

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:14.769
that they weren't already doing enough.

00:01:14.769 --> 00:01:21.930
The governing body sent a letter that clearly stated what was required for them to be saved.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.409
And look at the reaction of the congregation.

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:33.459
If we look at Acts chapter 15 and verses 30 and 31, here's how the congregation reacted

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:34.459
to this letter.

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:38.500
So when these men were dismissed, they went down to Antioch and they gathered the whole

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.299
group together and handed them the letter.

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.700
After reading it, they rejoiced over the encouragement.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.019
So how reassured the Gentile Christians must have been to get that letter.

00:01:53.019 --> 00:02:00.340
What a lesson for us, not to allow pride or a self-righteous spirit to push us to add

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.260
our own requirements for being saved instead of sticking to what Jehovah requires.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.000
Now, it's not just strong words that can make others feel like they're not doing enough.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.099
This can also happen by our actions.

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:21.580
And we have an example of that in Peter's actions because Peter goes to visit Antioch a few

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.379
months after the governing body had that meeting on the issue of a circumcision.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:33.300
If we could look at Galatians chapter 2, verses 11 and 12, the Apostle Paul tells us what

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.139
happened.

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:42.300
Galatians 2, 11 and 12, however, when Seifas came to Antioch, I resisted him face to face

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.379
because he was clearly in the wrong.

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:50.539
For before certain men from James arrived, he used to eat with the people of the nations.

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:56.780
But when they arrived, he stopped doing this, separated himself, fearing those of the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.699
circumcised class.

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:05.860
Now, it's interesting that the study note on these verses says this, Peter's conduct

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.020
could have undermined a decision that the governing body had made in the same year as Peter's

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.060
visit about 49 CE.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.300
Now that decision had confirmed that Gentile Christians were not required to obey the

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.500
Mazeq law.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.099
And Paul here reviews the incident at Antioch not to embarrass Peter, but to adjust a wrong

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:30.900
view held among the Galatians.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.939
So Peter in this case did not say to people, you must be circumcised.

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:42.860
But by not eating with the Gentile friends, while certain men from James were there, his

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.539
actions had a similar chilling effect.

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:53.939
He made the Gentile brothers feel inferior to Jewish Christians that were circumcised.

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:56.819
Now could we make others feel that way?

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:02.900
One sister told us an experience she had on a tour group for an international convention.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:09.139
Another sister in the same group would ask each person in the group, are you a pioneer?

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:13.020
Now if the person answered yes, she spent time talking to them and getting to know them.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.540
If the person said no, she moved on very quickly.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.660
When the sister came to our sister and asked her, she said she wasn't a pioneer and the

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.180
sister moved on quickly.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.019
Our sister said it made her feel awful.

00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:32.019
She already felt like she wasn't doing enough to serve Jehovah.

00:04:32.019 --> 00:04:37.980
She had been a pioneer, but now she was taking care of her sick parents.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.100
So what is the lesson for us?

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:46.939
By our words or by our actions, we can add our own requirements to being saved, which

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:49.939
can really discourage others.

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:56.139
If we stick, though, to Jehovah's requirements for being saved, we can rejoice along with

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.889
our brothers and sisters.

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.370
Here's a second lesson.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:08.569
Do we recognize when we need to take a question or a matter to oversight?

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:13.269
The brothers that told the Gentiles, you must be circumcised in order to be saved, had

00:05:13.269 --> 00:05:18.689
really taken it upon themselves to speak for the governing body of that time.

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:26.290
The governing body said in Acts 15 verse 24, be assured that message did not come from

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.889
us.

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:32.730
So clearly those brothers did not speak for the governing body.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:37.850
Now Paul and Barnabas were faced with the same question about circumcision.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:44.009
Did they make the same mistake and take it upon themselves to speak for the governing body?

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:52.850
To assist Paul to handle the matter correctly, his overseer, Jesus, provided some direction.

00:05:52.850 --> 00:06:01.009
In Galatians chapter 2 and verse 2, the Apostle Paul says that he took the matter to Jerusalem

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:04.930
as a result of a revelation.

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.889
And again, if you look at the study note on Galatians chapter 2 and verse 2, it says this,

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:16.250
Paul here adds a detail not found in Luke's account in the book of Acts.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:22.850
Christ, as the head of the Christian congregation, apparently used a revelation to direct Paul to

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:28.490
bring the important issue of circumcision to the Apostles and elders in Jerusalem.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:35.370
Yes, Jesus directed Paul to work through the governing body.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.970
Now I suppose Jesus could have simply told Paul in the revelation, Paul, you understand

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.610
it correctly, just go ahead and handle it.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.529
And I'm sure Paul would have thought that would be a lot easier.

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:47.810
I don't have to go all the way to Jerusalem.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.569
I don't have to deal with all those other brothers that have these strong views about circumcision.

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:58.449
But rather, Jesus was training Paul and others how he wanted questions like this to

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:01.889
be handled through the governing body.

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:06.449
Jesus did not bypass the arrangement that he had set up.

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:12.490
And the fact that Jesus handled the matter this way back then sets an example for us today

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:18.529
of how Jesus expects his modern day organization to work as well.

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:22.810
So we might ask, do we recognize when we need to take a question or a matter to a higher

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:23.810
authority?

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.370
Well, it's not always easy, is it?

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:30.569
When I decide this one on my own, or do I need to ask?

00:07:30.569 --> 00:07:38.050
Proverbs 13, 10 says, Presumptiousness leads only to strife, but wisdom belongs to those

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.050
who seek advice.

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:45.850
Wives have to decide, can I make this decision on my own, or do I need to take it to my

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:47.170
husband?

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:52.009
Elders, can they make this decision on their own or take it to the body of elders?

00:07:52.009 --> 00:07:55.850
Body of elders need to take it to the circuit overseer, to the branch office, and so on

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:56.850
it goes.

00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:02.569
I'm sure we have all had moments where we've made a decision, or sometimes we're about

00:08:02.569 --> 00:08:08.089
to take action, and someone says to us, did you ask oversight about that?

00:08:08.089 --> 00:08:11.490
Well, no.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.129
Don't you think we should?

00:08:13.129 --> 00:08:16.490
Yeah, that would be a great idea.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.410
See those are learning experiences.

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:25.930
By experience and training, we learn what things we can and should handle, and what things

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:29.930
need to be taken to our oversight.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:35.529
So in review, our first lesson, by our words or actions, we can add our own requirements

00:08:35.529 --> 00:08:38.649
for being saved, which can really discourage others.

00:08:38.649 --> 00:08:43.809
However, if we stick to Jehovah's requirements for being saved, we can rejoice along with

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:46.049
our brothers and sisters.

00:08:46.049 --> 00:08:54.210
In our second lesson, like Paul, be obedient, be ready to be trained in how to handle matters

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:56.850
according to theocratic direction.
