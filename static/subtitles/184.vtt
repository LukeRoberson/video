WEBVTT

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.019
To set this stage, we'd like to begin with a few thoughts about this subject,

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:08.779
surf Jehovah with rejoicing.

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:12.699
This is what we are told at Psalm 100 verse 2.

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:17.940
But do you surf Jehovah with rejoicing all the time?

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.379
I guess we all will agree that at times it can be difficult to be happy.

00:00:23.379 --> 00:00:29.059
So then, is it really important to surf Jehovah with rejoicing?

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:37.380
And what does it really mean? In other words, what is this joyful attitude that Jehovah expects from us?

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:46.240
And what can we do to surf Jehovah with rejoicing and maintain a joyful spirit?

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.359
How can we prove that it is important to surf Jehovah with rejoicing?

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:56.320
You might think of our goal, which is to reflect his personality.

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.439
In 1 Timothy 1 verse 11, he's called the happy God.

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:08.239
So isn't it logical that Jehovah expects us to be happy in his service?

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:14.400
In Deuteronomy chapter 28, we find a report of God's dealings with these relights.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:25.439
Here, Jehovah warned them of what would take place if they became disobedient and lost their joy in serving him.

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.040
We read at Deuteronomy chapter 28, beginning in verse 45,

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:38.879
all these curses will certainly come upon you because you did not listen to the voice of Jehovah your God

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:48.239
by keeping his commandments and because you did not surf Jehovah your God with rejoicing and joy of heart

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:52.159
when you had such an abundance of everything.

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:58.079
Jehovah took such good care of these relights and yet they were not happy.

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:02.079
This attitude was something he did not like at all.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.719
So we see that serving Jehovah joyfully is very important.

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.199
This was emphasized by what Jesus taught.

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:18.479
For example, in the sermon on the Mount, he helped his audience to understand

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:26.639
how to be happy. At times, this part in Matthew chapter 5 is referred to as the nine happinesses.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.159
Later, the Apostle Paul wrote about the fruitage of the Spirit.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.759
Joy is counted among the aspects of the fruitage of the Spirit.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:47.280
Being joyful is important and by means of his Spirit, Jehovah helps us to rejoice in his service.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:57.620
But is it realistic to expect that we all smile all the time and cheerfully sing songs the whole day?

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:05.860
Of course, this is not what Jehovah expects. We all have different personalities and express our

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:13.219
happiness differently. Also, there are moments in life when we are sad and disappointed.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:22.340
And Jehovah is fully aware that some of us are not healthy. Others might fight depression and

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:30.419
are therefore at times just not able to express joy in this way. And yet, he loves all of us and

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:39.300
appreciates us very much. So then, what is the joy that Jehovah expects from us?

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.620
What exactly is this joyful spirit or attitude?

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:53.620
Here in Dutronomy, the term rejoicing means the inner feeling and the outward manifestation of joy.

00:03:54.979 --> 00:04:02.659
And we also read about the joy of heart. The heart stands for what we are on the inside.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:09.219
This is the interior man and is displayed in all his various activities, desires,

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:19.699
affections, emotions, passions, thoughts, and so on. And so we see that joy comes from within us.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.740
Yet, does the joy we are talking about depend on circumstances?

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:33.220
Let's illustrate. I think it's safe to say that we all like sunshine.

00:04:34.019 --> 00:04:42.740
However, how does the farmer feel when he urgently needs it to rain? And he's waiting and waiting?

00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:52.339
He probably would be happier if he had rain. In these last days, we rarely, if ever,

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:58.899
have perfect circumstances with no problems. So I think we can all agree that our joy in

00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:06.660
Jehovah's service is not based on circumstances. And we've had here on this program and in our

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:13.300
publications, many examples of ones who have maintained their joy in Jehovah's service despite

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:23.860
challenging circumstances like poor health or opposition. So then what is it that makes us a happy

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:30.579
person? To help us to open up the scope of the answer, would you be willing to join me for a

00:05:30.579 --> 00:05:38.180
little experiment? Please close your eyes for a moment. Do you have your eyes closed?

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:48.980
So now, think about an apple. Now you can open your eyes again. Let me ask you a question.

00:05:50.339 --> 00:06:00.720
Did you think about a red apple, green apple, or a yellow apple? Why are you able to answer this

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:11.040
question? All I ask you to do was to think about an apple. The answer is we think in pictures.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:18.879
In fact, we think of countless pictures every day. And after we think about it, it's like we put

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:25.759
all of the pictures in a stack. And then when we think the same thought a second time, it's like we

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:33.360
pull the picture out from below and put it on top of the stack. The longer that we do not think

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:40.720
the thought, the deeper the pictures gets in the stack and it becomes more difficult to remember.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:50.879
Now, this stack of pictures representing our thoughts is our subconscious. This stack of pictures

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:59.120
makes up our emotional state or state of mind. It determines whether we are sad or happy,

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:10.110
whether we are bored or excited and so forth. And Jehovah our Creator is aware of this powerful

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:18.509
connection between our thoughts and pictures. Let's please turn to 2nd Kings chapter 6 to find

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:27.230
one example of how Jehovah made use of this. Here, we find the report about the King of Syria

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:36.430
who wanted to capture Elijah. How did this attendant feel? Let's see at 2nd Kings chapter 6

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:44.720
beginning with verse 15. When the attendant of the man of the true God rose early and went

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:50.800
outside, he saw that an army with horses and war turrets was surrounding the city.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:56.480
At once the attendant said to him, Alaz, my master, what are we to do?

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:04.160
The attendant was in fear. He probably thought about their defenseless position and saw himself

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:10.639
already captured by the Syrian army. Would Elijah be able to help his attendant?

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.360
Verse 16. But he, Elijah said,

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:21.839
do not be afraid for they are more who are with us than those who are with them.

00:08:23.519 --> 00:08:29.759
In other words, Elijah said, think of something else. Think of the many that are with us.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:37.519
Did this work? It seems the attendant was not able to focus on these reassuring thoughts.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:44.850
He could not envision Jehovah rescuing them. How did Jehovah help the attendant?

00:08:46.289 --> 00:08:53.090
At 2nd Kings chapter 6 verse 17 we read, and then Elijah began to pray and say,

00:08:54.690 --> 00:09:03.169
oh Jehovah, open his eyes please that he may see. Immediately, Jehovah opened the attendant's eyes

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:10.450
and he saw, and look, the mountainous region was full of horses and war chariots of fire all

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:18.850
around Elijah. And Jehovah helped the attendant with pictures. The horses and chariots captured

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:25.730
his attention. His thoughts now focused on the fact that Jehovah was with them and in full control.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:35.889
Now in his mind, he already saw Jehovah's victory and he was not concerned anymore. He was happy.

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:45.570
What he saw influenced his thoughts and changed his state of mind. Thoughts are so powerful.

00:09:46.769 --> 00:09:53.090
And how considerate Jehovah is. Remember, in the end, Jehovah did not need any of these horses and

00:09:53.169 --> 00:09:59.570
chariots. He saved Elijah and his attendant by striking the Syrian army with blindness.

00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:07.710
When we compare the emotions of Elijah with his attendant, what made the difference?

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:14.190
The circumstances were exactly the same. Their thoughts made the difference.

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:22.190
Now, what does this have to do with our subject? Serve Jehovah with rejoicing?

00:10:22.669 --> 00:10:27.389
The sofa we have established that Jehovah expects us to be happy, right?

00:10:28.909 --> 00:10:35.710
We have seen that our thoughts can be pictures that influence who we are and how we feel.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:43.149
Pictures and thoughts are closely connected. And that's why the Apostle Paul at Romans 12 verse 2

00:10:43.149 --> 00:10:50.190
highlights the importance of our thoughts when he said, we transformed by making your mind over.

00:10:51.149 --> 00:10:54.590
For at Ephesians 4 verse 23, he emphasized this by saying,

00:10:55.629 --> 00:11:01.149
and you should continue to be made new in your dominant mental attitude.

00:11:02.669 --> 00:11:08.669
Both Scriptures highlight that our thoughts are critical and have a bearing on our whole being.

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:14.269
Additionally, the Apostle Paul knew that we can change our thinking.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:21.230
Please turn with me to 2 Corinthians chapter 10 and see what he recommends that we do.

00:11:22.509 --> 00:11:25.870
Here in 2 Corinthians 10 verse 5, he says,

00:11:27.149 --> 00:11:32.909
we are bringing every thought into captivity to make it obedient to the Christ.

00:11:33.789 --> 00:11:38.909
Isn't this exactly what we should do? We control what we think.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:45.710
We avoid occupying our mind with thoughts that we can our faith, or thoughts that undermine

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:53.309
our determination to serve Jehovah. Remember we said, thoughts are like pictures that stay within us.

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:59.230
We cannot delete them and they will have an effect on how we feel.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:06.480
But is there something else we can do? Are you ready for a second experiment?

00:12:07.279 --> 00:12:12.879
And please close your eyes again and do not think of an apple.

00:12:15.169 --> 00:12:20.049
You can open your eyes again. Were you successful in not thinking of an apple?

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:25.570
If so, you probably have to force yourself to think of something else.

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:28.370
We are made to think.

00:12:30.049 --> 00:12:36.049
So the key for serving Jehovah with rejoicing lies not just in avoiding negative thoughts,

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:39.250
but also in thinking healthy thoughts.

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:46.850
Philippians chapter 4 lists a few of them. We read in verse 8,

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:54.850
finally brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are of serious concern,

00:12:54.850 --> 00:13:00.690
whatever things are righteous, whatever things are chased, whatever things are lovable,

00:13:01.649 --> 00:13:07.090
whatever things are well spoken of, whatever things are virtuous and whatever things are

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:15.090
praiseworthy, continue considering or thinking about meditating on these things.

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:22.450
By considering and meditating on these healthy subjects, we create pictures in our mind that

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:26.210
make it easier for us to display our joy in Jehovah's service.

00:13:27.009 --> 00:13:35.009
Serving Jehovah with rejoicing really depends on us. Happiness does not depend on our circumstances.

00:13:35.009 --> 00:13:38.769
Happiness comes from doing things Jehovah's way.

00:13:38.769 --> 00:13:44.370
When we actively control our thoughts, we add more pleasant pictures.

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:50.210
And even if in the past, we've experienced things that make it difficult to express happiness,

00:13:51.169 --> 00:13:58.049
in time, these unpleasant pictures will be buried under thoughts like those listed in Philippians

00:13:58.049 --> 00:14:07.490
chapter 4. And gradually, our inner peace, contentment, and happiness grows and can be seen by others.

00:14:08.529 --> 00:14:15.889
Jehovah, our happy God, appreciates every little step in this direction because it's important to

00:14:15.889 --> 00:14:25.009
him that we serve him with rejoicing.
