00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.069
But, Mum, listen.

00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:04.070
No, Jade.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.070
You listen.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.070
It's a list just another of your favours.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.070
It's time to move on, Love.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.349
Holidays are our time.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.349
It's all I get from you.

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:22.899
Promise me you'll be here.

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:38.880
I really don't want to disappoint her.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.420
I can't disappoint you, Hover.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.420
Of course.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.420
You love them both.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.420
Don't you think you can help you?

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.859
Talk to him.

00:00:51.859 --> 00:01:01.520
I spent a long time pouring out my heart to him.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:19.340
And I remembered something from one of the Psalms.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.340
I will walk in your truth.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.340
Unify my heart to fear your name.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:02:23.639
I remember someone once claiming to be all about the promises.

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:25.639
Made any good ones lately?

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:27.639
Absolutely.
