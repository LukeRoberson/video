00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:18.350
To convey Bible truth correctly, we must read from the Bible and our Christian publications accurately.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:27.350
To do this, we must prepare well, pronounce each word correctly, and speak clearly.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.350
As our brother reads Matthew 24, 43 and 44,

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.350
try to identify some common mistakes made in reading.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.350
To answer that question, notice what the Bible says at Matthew 24, 43 and 44.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.350
But no one more thing, if the housekeeper had known when the thief was coming,

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.350
he would have kept awake and not allowed his house to be broken into.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.350
On this account, you too prove yourselves ready because the Son of God is common

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.350
at an hour that you do not think it to be.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.350
Do you think that the householder might have been distracted by their reading?

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.350
Likely.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.349
Making any of these errors could convey a lack of respect for the material

00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:10.349
or change the meaning of the verse.

00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:12.349
Let's watch a better example.

00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:18.349
To answer that question, notice what the Bible says at Matthew 24, 43 and 44.

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:23.349
But no one thing, if the householder had known in what watch the thief was coming,

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:28.349
he would have kept awake and not allowed his house to be broken into.

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:34.349
On this account, you too prove yourselves ready because the Son of Man is coming

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:37.349
at an hour that you do not think to be it.

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:39.349
Much better.

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:46.349
To become effective at reading aloud, we should work to develop good habits in our personal reading.

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:51.349
Strive to understand the meaning and observe all punctuation marks.

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:57.349
For instance, at Matthew 8.3, Jesus did not say to the leper,

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:59.349
I want to be made clean.

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:04.349
But rather, I want to be made clean.

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:10.349
Running through the exclamation point completely changes the meaning.

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:17.349
In other verses, we have to emphasize the right words in order to convey the intended meaning.

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.349
For instance, how would you read 1st John 2.1?

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.349
Let's watch.

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.349
My little children, I am writing you these things so that you may not commit a sin.

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:35.349
And yet, if anyone does commit a sin, we have a helper with the Father, Jesus Christ, a righteous one.

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:42.349
Because the brother stressed the word father, he gave the impression that Jesus Christ is the father,

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.349
which was clearly not the writer's intent.

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.349
Let's give our brother another chance.

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.349
My little children, I am writing you these things so that you may not commit a sin.

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:03.349
And yet, if anyone does commit a sin, we have a helper with the Father, Jesus Christ, a righteous one.

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:09.349
This time, the speaker made it clear that the helper is Jesus Christ.

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:17.349
We should also be careful not to place undue emphasis on function words, such as prepositions and conjunctions.

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.349
For instance, at 1st Timothy 416, instead of reading,

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:27.349
you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:32.349
Why don't emphasize the verb to convey the full meaning of the text?

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:37.349
You will save both yourself and those who listen to you.

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:43.349
Clearly, there's more to accurate reading than simply pronouncing words correctly.

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.349
But even that can be a challenge at times.

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.349
Where can you find help to pronounce a word or name correctly?

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.349
Even Bible names?

00:03:52.349 --> 00:04:00.349
You can look them up in a dictionary, a listen to an audio recording of the publication, or ask a good reader for help.

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:05.979
Accurate reading adds to the dignity of the message we preach.

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:12.979
It allows our listener to focus on the message rather than be sidetracked by any mistakes.

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:17.980
Most important, it honors Jehovah God.
