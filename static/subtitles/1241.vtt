00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:16.839
God, can I interest you in one of our suits?

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:18.239
Okay, this sounds good.

00:00:18.239 --> 00:01:06.810
I'm gonna go great with this time.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.530
I wish I listened to the elders.

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.170
I can't believe the interest on these credit cards.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.890
There's just no way I can afford this.

00:01:15.769 --> 00:01:18.129
It didn't seem like it was that much money

00:01:18.129 --> 00:01:19.609
at the time when I was spending it.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.250
Maybe if I pick up a second job

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.730
or working nights, weekends,

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.290
I could hold on a second.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.170
Wait, no.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.170
What did the texts say this morning?

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:40.609
Keep your eyes open and guard against every sort of greed.

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:44.049
Because even when a person has an abundance,

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.890
his life does not result from the things he possesses.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.730
Guard against greed.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.370
It didn't feel like greed at the time.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.450
It seemed like these were all things I needed.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.450
But if it's starting to crowd out time for Jehovah,
