00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:04.120
Over here.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.120
It's Tom!

00:01:05.120 --> 00:02:36.710
It's Wiseman!

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:37.710
It's the best in the kingdom.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:50.939
The Queen Mother Mother.

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:54.110
May you live on for-

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.110
There's a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the Holy Gods.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.550
I'll you the interpretation.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.990
Who is this man?

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.990
Daniel.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.259
Who's Daniel?

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:55.699
Are you Daniel?

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:57.699
I am my Lord.

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:04.710
I've heard concerning you that you're able to provide interpretations.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:10.710
Now, if you're able to read the writing and make its interpretation known to me,

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.710
then you will be clothed with purple.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.709
A gold necklace will be placed around your neck.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.709
And you will rule as the third one in the kingdom.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.709
You may keep your gifts.

00:04:23.709 --> 00:04:26.709
Give your presence to others.

00:04:26.709 --> 00:04:30.709
However, I will read the writing to the King.

00:04:30.709 --> 00:04:37.709
The most high God granted to Nebuchadnezzar the kingdom and greatness and honor and majesty.

00:04:38.709 --> 00:04:44.709
But when his heart became haughty, he was brought down from the throne of his kingdom.

00:04:44.709 --> 00:04:55.170
And his dignity was taken away.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.170
But you.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:02.170
Nebuchadnezzar, you have not humbled your heart, although you knew all of this.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:07.170
Instead, you exalted yourself against the Lord of the heavens.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.170
You had them bring you the vessels of his house.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:20.170
And then you and your nobles, your concubines and secondary wives drank wine from them

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:35.350
and praised the gods of silver and gold, gods who see nothing and hear nothing and know nothing.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:42.350
But you've not glorified the God and whose hand is your breath and all your ways.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:47.350
So the hand was sent from him.

00:05:47.350 --> 00:06:04.220
This is the interpretation of the words, meaning God has numbered the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end.

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:22.720
Pequel, you have been weighed in the balances and found lacking.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:40.350
Pearest, your kingdom's been divided and given to the meads and the Persians.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:07:26.410
Congrats. This is Daniel, a Jew taken captive by the Babylonians.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:33.579
Did you interpret the handwriting from the gods?

00:07:33.579 --> 00:07:42.579
No. And not me, O King, my God, the God of Israel.

00:07:42.579 --> 00:07:48.339
We could use a seetrap who understands the captives.

00:07:48.339 --> 00:07:56.339
I confess, a seetrap is not as prominent position as Boshazar granted you.

00:07:56.339 --> 00:08:00.339
My Lord, Daniel refused every gift and honor Boshazar offered him.

00:08:00.339 --> 00:08:08.699
Bad without a price. We don't need you as a seetrap.

00:08:08.699 --> 00:08:20.439
We need you over them. Torah pronounced Daniel's appointment throughout the kingdom.

00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:25.439
I want those stealing from the treasury to know that they will now be held accountable.

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:55.840
Daniel, you'll make a fine high official.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:29.019
Only with Jehovah's help. He is the land taxor.

00:09:29.019 --> 00:09:38.929
Another revolt.

00:09:38.929 --> 00:09:40.929
This is far more troubling.

00:09:40.929 --> 00:09:43.929
I just collected the land tax from an administrator.

00:09:43.929 --> 00:09:44.929
Did he pay?

00:09:44.929 --> 00:09:47.929
Yes. But he refuses to give us our fees.

00:09:47.929 --> 00:09:52.929
I've heard the same problem. They're calling anything more than the tax extortion.

00:09:52.929 --> 00:09:54.929
What's changed?

00:09:54.929 --> 00:09:55.929
Daniel.

00:09:55.929 --> 00:10:00.210
Have you offered him anything to make him more reason up?

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:02.210
He won't take a shackle of silver.

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:06.210
Daniel claims that what he receives is more than enough.

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:11.210
Don't be so naive. He's putting on a shot of integrity for the king.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:16.210
It won't last. Dress will tire him soon enough.

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:29.879
There seems to be a discrepancy in the taxes to the treasury. My Lord.

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:32.879
You're brave to say that here.

00:10:32.879 --> 00:10:35.879
I know it's hard to hear.

00:10:35.879 --> 00:10:37.879
We'll review the evidence.

00:10:37.879 --> 00:10:41.879
Daniel, your time here has given you much wisdom.

00:10:41.879 --> 00:10:43.879
How long have you been here?

00:10:43.879 --> 00:10:46.879
Over 70 years.

00:10:46.879 --> 00:10:48.879
Share more with me.

00:10:48.879 --> 00:10:51.879
Tell me about the dreams you interpreted for Nebuchadnezzar.

00:10:51.879 --> 00:10:55.879
Interpretations belong to my God, Jehovah.

00:10:55.879 --> 00:10:58.879
He revealed the dreams to me.

00:10:58.879 --> 00:11:14.629
Have I really been in Babylon over 70 years?

00:11:14.629 --> 00:11:20.700
Jeremiah's prophecy.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:43.250
When 70 years have been fulfilled,

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:48.250
I'll call to account the king of Babylon and that nation for their error.

00:11:48.250 --> 00:12:14.669
What does this mean for God's people?

00:12:14.669 --> 00:12:42.299
When 70 years of Babylon are fulfilled, I will turn my attention to you.

00:12:42.299 --> 00:12:50.580
And I will make good my promise by bringing you back to this place.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:13:09.019
Judah must approach Jehovah to confess the sin of my people.

00:13:09.019 --> 00:13:21.279
Oh, Jehovah, you do here, but do forgive.

00:13:21.279 --> 00:13:24.279
Oh, Jehovah, do pay attention and act.

00:13:24.279 --> 00:13:30.460
Not to lay for your own sake.

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.460
Oh, my God.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:44.299
Oh, Daniel, come to give you insight and understanding.

00:13:44.299 --> 00:13:49.759
When you began your intrudey word went out.

00:13:49.759 --> 00:13:51.759
I have come to report to you.

00:13:51.759 --> 00:14:13.100
Daniel, as they're already entered here.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.100
Hello, Daniel.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.100
It's so good to see you.

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.100
Efer, come sit with me.

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.100
I have good news.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:28.899
What's the good news?

00:14:28.899 --> 00:14:34.899
Jehovah has long told us we will return to Judah.

00:14:34.899 --> 00:14:41.740
I looked again at Jeremiah's prophecy.

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.740
This is what Jehovah says.

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:47.740
When 70 years at Babylon are fulfilled,

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:50.740
I will make good my promise

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:54.740
by bringing you back to this place.

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.740
70 years.

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:59.740
That means God's people will return soon.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:05.940
How can you be sure?

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:07.940
Jehovah sent an angel to tell me.

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.940
An angel?

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:14.940
He said that the city and its temple will be rebuilt.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:18.940
And Messiah will finally come.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:22.940
You will get to see the temple rebuilt.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:27.860
But won't it be dangerous?

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:34.860
Jehovah is eager to fulfill the needs of his people.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.860
He told Isaiah,

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:40.860
we will bear children for distress.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:46.860
For there's the offspring made up of those blessed by Jehovah.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:48.860
And if Jehovah says it...

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.860
It says good is done.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:53.860
But isn't the land desolate?

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:58.860
That's why we all need skilled builders for the restoration work.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:05.600
Does this mean you'll return to Judah?

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:15.629
I sure hope so.

00:16:15.629 --> 00:16:17.629
Have a team of workers maintain the roads.

00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:22.629
Otherwise, conditions will only worsen during the rainy season.

00:16:22.629 --> 00:16:26.230
Teracy that is done.

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:28.230
How is it that you know so much?

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:30.230
I can't take credit, my Lord.

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:31.230
I just...

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:35.230
We have many great men who provide the information we need, O King.

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:42.559
Daniel, about that seetrap in Susa.

00:16:42.559 --> 00:16:45.559
Should he be replaced?

00:16:45.559 --> 00:16:48.559
My men have thoroughly investigated.

00:16:48.559 --> 00:16:53.559
And the seetrap has been diverting palace money to his own pocket.

00:16:53.559 --> 00:16:54.559
That's impossible.

00:16:54.559 --> 00:16:56.559
Isn't he your nephew?

00:16:56.559 --> 00:16:57.559
What's on us?

00:16:57.559 --> 00:16:58.559
Indeed.

00:16:58.559 --> 00:17:01.559
And I can vouch for his integrity.

00:17:01.559 --> 00:17:03.559
There must be some mistake.

00:17:03.559 --> 00:17:09.349
How can Daniel know his character as I do?

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:13.349
I will speak with him and resolve the matter.

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:17.349
We maids and Persians are not as intolerant as these Jews.

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:20.349
I'm sure we can fix this.

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:22.349
Very well.

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:24.349
So, I look quickly, and that will be all.

00:17:24.349 --> 00:18:04.619
My Lord, I'm so sorry.

00:18:04.619 --> 00:18:06.619
You have guests.

00:18:06.619 --> 00:18:24.890
All you Jews do is pray.

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:28.890
I did not serve the King the way I do without God's help.

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:33.890
Serve the King by intimidating seetraps.

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:35.890
I've only done what I should.

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:41.710
An outsider has no place telling us how to conduct business.

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:43.710
I acted in the King's interest.

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:47.710
We've heard how you acted in Nebuchadnezzar's interest.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:52.500
You made him go insane.

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.500
That was a message from Jehovah.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:19:00.390
Call it what you will, but do not interfere with us.

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:03.390
If it seemed easy to remove a seetrap,

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:09.059
think of how much easier it will be to get rid of an old Jew.

00:19:09.059 --> 00:19:37.970
It's an honor to be with you.

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:39.970
Do you know why someone do?

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:40.970
No, my Lord.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:45.970
That seetrap, whose dismissal Daniel recommended, was become of him.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:49.970
Yes, we thoroughly investigated the matter.

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:51.970
Was there negligence?

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:52.970
None.

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:53.970
Any omission of duty?

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:55.970
Not at all.

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:58.970
All taxes do the treasury have come to the treasury?

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:03.970
Every shackle of gold and court of beer are accounted for.

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:09.220
Daniel reached a different conclusion.

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:13.220
My Daniel, he served the Babylonian kings well, but...

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:15.220
He's so old.

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:19.220
What autonomous means is at Daniel's age, how reliable is his judgment?

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:22.220
His ideas are outdated.

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:25.220
Besides, he is a Jew.

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.220
We're tolerant of all peoples.

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:29.220
Yes.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:30.220
Of course, that's my point.

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:34.390
Daniel, we were just talking about you.

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:36.390
You were right.

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:39.640
There's been a revolt in Susa.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.640
They demand a new seetrap.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.640
One who doesn't steal from that.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.640
But, my Lord, surely...

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.640
Enough!

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.640
I sent my own inspectors.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:53.390
Men, I trust.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:21:00.410
Daniel, you've distinguished yourself over these men.

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:09.819
Imagine what I could do if you were my prime minister.

00:21:09.819 --> 00:21:11.819
Perhaps we could approach the king.

00:21:11.819 --> 00:21:13.819
That's not use.

00:21:13.819 --> 00:21:15.819
Daniel's manipulating him.

00:21:15.819 --> 00:21:17.819
We need an accusation against Daniel.

00:21:17.819 --> 00:21:19.819
Something to rise can't ignore.

00:21:19.819 --> 00:21:21.819
But no one's accused him of anything.

00:21:21.819 --> 00:21:23.819
Not yet.

00:21:23.819 --> 00:21:25.819
Assemble the team to comb through our laws.

00:21:25.819 --> 00:21:28.819
Surely he's violated something.

00:21:28.819 --> 00:21:32.819
You interview merchants, inspectors, officials,

00:21:32.819 --> 00:21:34.819
where we'll make an accusation against him.

00:21:34.819 --> 00:21:36.819
As sure the accuser.

00:21:36.819 --> 00:21:38.819
He will be generously rewarded.

00:21:39.819 --> 00:21:42.819
Search for any scandal that might implicate him.

00:21:42.819 --> 00:22:12.099
There's nothing in the records.

00:22:12.099 --> 00:22:14.099
Anything.

00:22:14.099 --> 00:22:17.099
Not a shuckle of silver is missing.

00:22:17.099 --> 00:22:24.500
In fact, when Daniel gets involved, corruption and loss go down.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:25.500
Keep searching.

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:32.519
No one will speak against him.

00:22:32.519 --> 00:22:41.299
They all love him.

00:22:41.299 --> 00:22:43.299
And he has the king's trust.

00:22:43.299 --> 00:22:50.309
Usually the foreign merchants are ignored when they experience theft.

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:55.660
However, Daniel stands up for them and investigates.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:23:00.740
He has these returned, whatever was stolen.

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:05.269
Even his friends are spotless.

00:23:05.269 --> 00:23:10.269
They could never once forbade anyone to speak against their God.

00:23:10.269 --> 00:23:14.269
Supposedly, this Jehovah saved them from the furnace

00:23:14.269 --> 00:23:18.269
when they refused to worship a Babylonian God.

00:23:18.269 --> 00:23:20.269
Jews went worship other gods.

00:23:20.269 --> 00:23:29.779
So it would seem to think you've solved our problem.

00:23:29.779 --> 00:23:30.779
Katu?

00:23:30.779 --> 00:23:31.779
Otanas?

00:23:31.779 --> 00:23:33.779
What favor do you seek?

00:23:33.779 --> 00:23:36.779
O King Darius may live on forever.

00:23:36.779 --> 00:23:40.779
This Babylon of which you are king is mighty but diverse.

00:23:40.779 --> 00:23:44.779
There are Babylonians, Egyptians, Greeks, and others.

00:23:44.779 --> 00:23:47.779
It is Otanas, I know these things.

00:23:47.779 --> 00:23:52.779
You are the rightful king, but also a foreigner and a newcomer.

00:23:52.779 --> 00:23:57.779
The people must adapt, or the kingdom could become unstable.

00:23:57.779 --> 00:24:00.779
What do you suggest?

00:24:00.779 --> 00:24:04.779
All royal officials, prefects, say traps, high royal officers,

00:24:04.779 --> 00:24:10.779
and governors have consulted together to establish a royal decree

00:24:10.779 --> 00:24:12.779
and to enforce a ban.

00:24:12.779 --> 00:24:17.779
For 30 days, whoever makes a petition to any God or man,

00:24:17.779 --> 00:24:23.779
except to you, O King, should be thrown into the lion's pit.

00:24:23.779 --> 00:24:26.779
The people are not above rebellion.

00:24:26.779 --> 00:24:33.420
Look what happened in Susa.

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:39.420
Now, O King, may you establish the decree and sign it

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:44.920
so that it cannot be changed according to the law of the needs and the versions.

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:58.859
Which cannot be annulled.

00:24:58.859 --> 00:25:04.859
At this time, our empire experiences peace and prosperity unlike ever seen before.

00:25:04.859 --> 00:25:11.859
The recent acts of defiance in Susa, along with similar acts by small groups of radicals,

00:25:11.859 --> 00:25:14.859
seek to undermine our way of life.

00:25:14.859 --> 00:25:19.859
A way of life, we will sacrifice for nothing.

00:25:19.859 --> 00:25:25.859
In honor of the glorious freedom so kindly granted by the empire,

00:25:25.859 --> 00:25:32.859
and as a reminder of its sovereignty, I derise the need to make this decree.

00:25:32.859 --> 00:25:39.859
For 30 days, anyone who makes a petition to any God or man,

00:25:39.859 --> 00:25:43.859
except to the King, should be thrown into the lion's pit.

00:25:43.859 --> 00:26:11.390
Pray, are you?

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:12.390
That's right.

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:23.049
You know me, and so do my enemies.

00:26:23.049 --> 00:26:30.049
I pray at my window three times a day, every day,

00:26:30.049 --> 00:26:33.049
if I even appear to compromise.

00:26:33.049 --> 00:26:37.380
What would they think?

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:41.369
That you stop praying altogether.

00:26:41.369 --> 00:26:49.369
Or even worse, that I had trained my worship for my life.

00:26:49.369 --> 00:26:52.369
I know Jehovah.

00:26:52.369 --> 00:26:57.369
And if I trust him, he'll reward me.

00:26:57.369 --> 00:27:03.380
I don't know how, but he will.

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:08.849
Pray that I keep my faith.

00:27:08.849 --> 00:27:15.319
That we all keep our faith, no matter how this ends.

00:27:15.319 --> 00:27:37.900
I have something for you.

00:27:37.900 --> 00:28:21.619
Hear me, O Jehovah.

00:28:21.619 --> 00:28:41.019
When I cry, show me a favor, and answer me.

00:28:41.019 --> 00:28:50.279
Your face, O Jehovah, I will seek to find for you are my helper.

00:28:50.279 --> 00:29:04.009
Believe me, my God of salvation.

00:29:04.009 --> 00:30:14.269
O King, may you live on forever.

00:30:14.269 --> 00:30:22.289
Did you not sign a ban, stating that for 30 days,

00:30:22.289 --> 00:30:26.289
any man who makes a petition to any God, or man?

00:30:26.289 --> 00:30:28.289
Except to you, O King.

00:30:28.289 --> 00:30:30.289
Should be thrown into the lance pit?

00:30:30.289 --> 00:30:34.289
Yes, the matters, well established according to the law of the Means and Persians.

00:30:34.289 --> 00:30:36.289
What's your business?

00:30:36.289 --> 00:30:44.109
Daniel, who is of the Exiles of Judah, has paid no regard to you, O King,

00:30:44.109 --> 00:30:49.119
nor to the ban that you signed.

00:30:49.119 --> 00:30:59.640
But three times a day, he is praying.

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:10.990
Daniel, you can't be true.

00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:12.990
Are you sure?

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:15.990
He doesn't even try to deny it.

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:20.619
Were there witnesses?

00:31:20.619 --> 00:31:23.619
All five of us, my Lord, we can't test him.

00:31:23.619 --> 00:31:25.619
But he is old.

00:31:25.619 --> 00:31:27.619
Does he know what he's doing?

00:31:27.619 --> 00:31:34.619
As a high official, surely he understands what it means to obey the King?

00:31:34.619 --> 00:31:40.230
Let me be.

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:41.230
Should we arrest?

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:43.230
Leave the matter to me.

00:31:43.230 --> 00:32:42.259
Daniel should indeed be made an example of.

00:32:42.259 --> 00:32:47.259
I will remove him from his post and expel him from the city tomorrow morning.

00:32:47.259 --> 00:32:48.259
My Lord.

00:32:48.259 --> 00:32:51.259
All will learn that our laws must be obeyed.

00:32:51.259 --> 00:32:57.259
But the law actually states that the accused would be thrown into the lance pit, my Lord.

00:32:57.259 --> 00:32:59.259
I see what you're doing.

00:32:59.259 --> 00:33:01.259
Have you no shame?

00:33:01.259 --> 00:33:07.259
The law of the Means and Persians is that any ban or decree that the King establishes

00:33:07.259 --> 00:33:10.259
cannot be changed.

00:33:10.259 --> 00:33:15.259
We only wish the King to receive the honor he deserves.

00:33:15.259 --> 00:36:23.050
Your God whom you are continually serving will rest in the river.

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:24.050
Remove the stone.

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:34.039
Daniel.

00:36:34.039 --> 00:36:38.820
Daniel.

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:45.599
Oh, King, may you live on forever.

00:36:45.599 --> 00:36:49.460
Lives.

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:50.460
Bring him up.

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:57.460
My God sent his angel and shut the mouths of the lions.

00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:02.090
And they have not harmed me.

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:13.440
For I was found innocent before him, nor have I done any wrong to you.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:19.880
O King.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.880
Armenia is mine.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:23.880
Daniel let them off too easily.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:28.880
We need their exceptional horses for our cavalry.

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:33.380
And a few for myself.

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:34.380
Fine.

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:36.380
You take Armenia.

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:38.380
I have my own bacteria.

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.380
And it's precious stones.

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:45.380
Must you divide a Daniel's kingdom now?

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:53.880
The meaning of this.

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:57.880
You're being arrested for crimes against the rice, the King.

00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:59.880
The King ordered Daniel's arrest not ours.

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:01.880
Daniel was arrested.

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:06.699
And lifted from the pit this morning.

00:38:06.699 --> 00:38:08.699
Unharmed.

00:38:08.699 --> 00:38:10.699
They can't be.

00:38:10.699 --> 00:38:12.699
The lions must have already been fed.

00:38:12.699 --> 00:38:17.130
Perhaps they were ill.

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:20.889
The lions were ill.

00:38:20.889 --> 00:38:21.889
Not hungry.

00:38:21.889 --> 00:38:32.269
Throw them in their families into the pit.

00:38:32.269 --> 00:38:34.269
But they can test their theories.

00:38:34.269 --> 00:38:36.269
No!

00:38:36.269 --> 00:38:39.269
No!

00:38:39.269 --> 00:38:54.250
I'm issuing an order that in every domain of my kingdom,

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:59.250
people are to tremble in fear before the God of Daniel.

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:02.250
For he is the living God and he endures forever.

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:04.250
His kingdom will never be the same.

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:10.250
He rescues, saves, and performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth.

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:15.250
For he rescued Daniel from the paw of the lions.

00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:16.250
Do I answer with that?

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:19.250
He's sending it to all of his subjects.

00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:21.250
You were so worried.

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:23.250
Were you scared?

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:25.250
I was very scared.

00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:29.250
But Joel, that helps us when we're scared.

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:32.250
They're scared of going to Jerusalem.

00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:33.250
You for it.

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:39.260
We're still thinking about it.

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:40.260
About you.

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:41.260
Are you going back?

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:43.260
The King says we're all out to go.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:40:11.139
I'd love to go home.

00:40:11.139 --> 00:40:24.539
I think it's too late for me.

00:40:24.539 --> 00:40:25.539
No, I'm going to go either.

00:40:25.539 --> 00:40:28.539
Home, no, no, don't cry.

00:40:28.539 --> 00:40:40.199
If you'll go, you'll see a better city than the one I left.

00:40:40.199 --> 00:40:42.199
You'll see prophecies fulfilled.

00:40:42.199 --> 00:40:53.960
A city full of people worshiping Joel, but new temple.

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:56.960
The most beautiful building on earth.

00:40:56.960 --> 00:42:11.630
Stay, don't be blessed.

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:46.179
That I might dwell in the house of Joel over all the days of my life.

00:42:46.179 --> 00:43:14.630
To gaze, to look, to the appreciation.

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:19.380
It's tough.

00:43:19.380 --> 00:44:19.889
Daniel, you need to rest.

00:44:19.889 --> 00:45:21.289
Oh, Daniel, you very precious man.

00:45:21.289 --> 00:45:23.289
I have been sent to you.

00:45:23.289 --> 00:45:27.659
Do not be afraid, Daniel.

00:45:27.659 --> 00:45:31.659
Your words have been heard from the first day you gave your heart to understanding

00:45:31.659 --> 00:45:34.659
and humbling yourself before your God.

00:45:34.659 --> 00:45:40.659
I have come to make you understand what will befall your people in the final part of the days.

00:45:40.659 --> 00:45:42.659
I have no strength.

00:45:42.659 --> 00:45:45.659
There's a breath left in me.

00:45:45.659 --> 00:45:48.659
Do not be afraid of very precious man.

00:45:48.659 --> 00:45:49.659
May you have peace.

00:45:49.659 --> 00:45:51.659
Be strong.

00:45:51.659 --> 00:45:54.619
Be strong.

00:45:54.619 --> 00:46:10.340
That by Lord speak, for you have strengthened me.

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:15.340
I will tell you that things recorded in the writings of truth.

00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:19.340
Look, three more kings will stand up for Persia.

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:41.409
And the fourth one will have mass greater riches than one.

00:46:41.409 --> 00:46:46.409
Oh my Lord, what will be the outcome of these things?

00:46:46.409 --> 00:46:49.409
Happy is the one who keeps an expectation.

00:46:49.409 --> 00:46:53.579
Go on to the end.

00:46:53.579 --> 00:46:59.579
You will rest, but you will stand up for your lot at the end of the days.

00:46:59.579 --> 00:47:22.010
If we eat those foods, we'll disobey our God.

00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:24.010
You fear your God?

00:47:24.010 --> 00:47:25.010
I do.

00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:32.500
Interpretations belong to my God, Jehovah.

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:35.500
I know that He will reveal it to me.

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:43.480
Jehovah is eager to fulfill the needs of His people.

00:47:43.480 --> 00:48:02.969
And if I trust Him, they reward me.
