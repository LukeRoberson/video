00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.099
Welcome to JW Broadcasting for November 2023.

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:31.859
On October 7th, the Watchtower Bible and Track Society of Pennsylvania held its annual meeting.

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.859
Usually, you would be viewing this portion of the program in January 2024.

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:44.859
However, you are now able to enjoy four talks this month, November 2023.

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:49.859
These talks have been especially prepared at the direction of the governing body.

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:55.859
They want the worldwide brotherhood to be aware of the content as soon as possible.

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.859
Please, pay close attention and enjoy the program.

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:16.750
Well, it's an absolute delight to be here today, isn't it?

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.750
And you're going to get happier as the morning goes long.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.750
The annual meeting, as an example, I'm going to pick a year of 2013.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.750
Now, that annual meeting has been called Landmark.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.750
We've even stated that. We called it a Landmark annual meeting.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.750
You might think that all annual meetings are Landmark, and many of us here would agree with that.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.750
But that one was very special. At that meeting, the revised edition of the New World Translation in English was released.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.750
Very special annual meeting.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:01.750
And that Landmark Bible release continues to be a blessing for many people around the earth as more languages are added.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:10.750
Now, 10 years later, exactly 10 years later, we have arrived at another truly Landmark annual meeting.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:18.750
This time, Jehovah has helped the faithful and discreet slave to discern deeper principles

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.750
and understanding from that very same word of truth.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.750
And this understanding is now going to be passed on to you.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:39.180
Are you ready? Are you excited to hear it?

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:53.060
Let's listen very carefully to this next symposium.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.060
And again, each speaker will introduce the next one on the program.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:10.060
Please pay close attention to Brother Gage Flegal as he begins with the talk entitled Love Jehovah Praise Jehovah.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:21.060
The day was nice in 1133 CE. Jesus was busy in the temple teaching just a few days prior to his death.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.060
He silenced the scribes and the Pharisees with his irrefutable logic.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:34.060
At the same time, sharing some of the most profound teachings of his earthly ministry.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:41.060
For instance, pay back Caesar's things to Caesar, but God's things to God.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:51.060
Then one of the scribes came forward and asked Jesus, what is the greatest commandment?

00:03:51.060 --> 00:04:02.060
How did Jesus respond? His response would have far-reaching implications even down to our day for anyone claiming to be a Christian.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.060
We find his response in Mark chapter 12. I invite you to turn there.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.060
Mark chapter 12, and notice please with me verses 29 and 30.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:20.060
Mark 12, 29 and 30. Jesus answered the first or the most important commandment.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:27.060
The greatest commandment is, here, O Israel, Jehovah, our God is one Jehovah.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:40.060
And you must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind and with your whole strength.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:47.060
You must love Jehovah. Love God. It sounds simple, right?

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.060
Well, billions of people claim to love God, but they love pleasures more.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:00.060
Or they're willing to fight and kill their fellow man. Or they refuse to live by God's moral standards.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.060
All such things contradict their claim to love God.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:11.060
Well, Jesus demonstrated that love of God requires more than a feeling of affection.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:18.060
Jesus stressed how completely we must love God with our whole heart, with our whole soul, with our whole mind, with our whole strength.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:26.060
Does that leave anything out? Our eyes, our ears, our hands?

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:33.060
Well, the study notes on verse 30 help us to understand that this includes our emotions, desires, and feelings.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:39.060
It includes our intellectual faculties and power of reason. It includes our physical and mental strength.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:45.060
Yes, our whole being, all that we are, we must devote to our love to Jehovah.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:51.060
Love for God must govern a person's entire life. Nothing is left out.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:57.060
Well, shortly after emphasizing the greatest commandment, and again, we're thinking of Jesus.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.060
He's there in the temple shortly after emphasizing the greatest commandment.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:09.699
Jesus shines a light on both bad and good examples of love for God.

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:15.699
First, he sharply condemned the scribes and the Pharisees for their pretense of love for God.

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:21.199
Now, if you want the full condemnation, it's found in Matthew chapter 23.

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:28.199
Those hypocrites, they gave even the tenth or a tithe of small tiny herbs,

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:32.199
but they ignored the weightier matters of justice and mercy and faithfulness.

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:35.699
That was the bad example.

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:41.699
But then Jesus gave his attention to an outstanding example of love for God.

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:46.699
If you're still there in Mark chapter 12, notice starting in verse 41.

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:57.399
And Jesus sat down with the treasury chests in view and began observing how the crowd was dropping money into the treasury chests.

00:06:57.399 --> 00:07:01.399
And many rich people were dropping in many coins.

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:07.399
Now, a poor widow came and dropped in two small coins, a very little value.

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:10.399
So he called his disciples to him and said to them,

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:17.399
Truly, I say to you that this poor widow put in more than all the others who put money into the treasury chests.

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:26.399
For they all put in out of their surplus, but she out of her want put in everything she had, all she had to live on.

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:33.740
The coins of the needy widow were worth about 15 minutes wages.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.740
Yet Jesus expressed his father's view of her worship.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:40.740
He commended her whole soul's sacrifice.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.740
What do we learn?

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:47.740
Well, clearly the lessons go far beyond material giving.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.740
Motive in our worship of Jehovah is important to him.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:08:00.740
Jehovah doesn't compare us with others or even previous versions of ourselves, younger versions of ourselves.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:06.740
Jehovah simply wants love for him with our whole heart, soul, mind, and strength.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:12.740
Not as they were 10 or 20 years ago, but as they currently are now.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:17.220
Now a question in reference to love for Jehovah.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:25.220
Is it reasonable for Jehovah to expect us to love him with our whole heart, soul, mind, and strength?

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.220
Is it reasonable?

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:33.220
Yes, absolutely. Why can we say that?

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:40.220
Because Jehovah loves us with his whole heart, soul, mind, and strength.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.220
How so?

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:47.220
Well, let's turn to Isaiah chapters 40 through 44.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:52.220
And there will consider a few of the many reasons we have to love Jehovah.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:58.220
And at the same time, we'll consider some examples of the depth of Jehovah's love for us.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:04.720
So our first example is in Isaiah chapter 40 and notice please verse 11.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.720
Isaiah 40 verse 11.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:12.720
There it says, like a shepherd, he will care for his flock.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.720
With his arm, he will gather together the lambs, and in his bosom he will carry them.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.720
He will gently lead those nursing their young.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:24.720
Here we find a beautiful word picture of Jehovah. Jehovah is a tender shepherd.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:31.320
At Ezekiel chapter 34 verses 15 and 16, Jehovah says,

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.320
I myself will feed my sheep.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:40.320
The last one I will search for, the stray, I will bring back the injured, I will bandage as we notice in the illustration.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:48.320
And the weak, I will strengthen what a touching picture of compassion and tender care.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:54.320
If we fall in hurt ourselves, or if we stumble in the briar patch, sort of speak,

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.320
Jehovah bandages us. He helps us to heal.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.320
When we seek his help, he doesn't reproach us.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.320
You should have known better, no.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:10.320
But he does try to help us not to stray in the future with reminders from his word.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.320
And what is the effect on the sheep?

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.320
Well, as we saw in the illustration, he feels secure in Jehovah's care.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:19.320
How do we feel in Jehovah's care? His compassion at care.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.320
We too feel secure.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:28.320
We might say that Jehovah loves us with all his heart, his compassion.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:33.320
Doesn't that increase your love for him?

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.320
Let's consider a second reason why we have, that we have to love Jehovah.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:42.320
Isaiah chapter 40, notice verses 28 and 29.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.320
Verse 28 says, do you not know, have you not heard?

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:52.320
Jehovah, the creator of the ends of the earth, is a God for all eternity.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.320
He never tires out or grows weary.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:00.320
His understanding is unsearchable. He gives power to the tired one.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.320
And full might to those lacking strength.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:16.059
With Jehovah's mighty Holy Spirit, he created everything, beginning with his firstborn son.

00:11:17.059 --> 00:11:21.059
To myriads of mighty Spirit creatures.

00:11:21.059 --> 00:11:25.059
To the vast universe, with its trillions upon trillions of stars,

00:11:25.059 --> 00:11:29.059
to this beautiful earth, with its endless variety of plant and animal life.

00:11:29.059 --> 00:11:35.059
To the human body, with its awe-inspiring ability and versatility.

00:11:35.059 --> 00:11:39.059
Jehovah is truly the almighty creator.

00:11:39.059 --> 00:11:43.340
Now, think about this.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:49.340
What happens when you or I become completely exhausted, completely tired?

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:52.340
Maybe at the end of a long day, when a human becomes physically tired?

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.340
How does he recharge?

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:58.340
Do we plug into a charging station like an electric car?

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.340
No.

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:04.340
We're marvelously designed to recharge through rest.

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:07.340
And the food that we take into our bodies are fuel.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:10.340
The calories, the energy and food are evidence of Jehovah's love.

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:16.340
Not only does it recharge us, but it brings us to light, too.

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:19.340
What did you have for breakfast?

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.340
Maybe here at the assembly hall.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:27.340
The average glazed doughnut contains about 190 to 300 calories.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:31.340
We hope you're not counting calories during this annual meeting season.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:41.669
But whatever your choice, the energy and food is a gift of Almighty God to help sustain us.

00:12:41.669 --> 00:12:46.750
To recharge us.

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:53.750
Now, a question that we ask, though, what happens when we become tired of dealing with life's trials?

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:58.750
Maybe with problems that don't have a solution in this system of things?

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:04.750
Well, when we maintain a good spiritual routine, then Jehovah gives us power.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.750
Power to the tired one.

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:12.750
His Holy Spirit strengthens us, enables us to go forward in the battle yet another day.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:16.750
Power beyond what is normal strengthens us.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.750
Yes, Jehovah gives power to the tired one.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:25.289
We might say that Jehovah loves us with all his strength.

00:13:25.289 --> 00:13:29.289
Doesn't that draw you to him as a person?

00:13:29.289 --> 00:13:32.289
Let's consider another reason we have to love Jehovah.

00:13:32.289 --> 00:13:39.100
This time in Isaiah chapter 41, verses 10 and 13,

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:46.100
there our God says, do not be afraid for I am with you.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:50.100
Do not be anxious for I am your God.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.100
I will fortify you. Yes, I will help you.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:58.100
I will really hold on to you with my right hand of righteousness.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:05.100
Verse 13, for I, Jehovah your God, am grasping your right hand.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:12.960
The one saying to you, do not be afraid, I will help you.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.370
Jehovah is our helper.

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:21.370
Jehovah grasps our right hand with his right hand of righteousness.

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:28.370
In other words, he at times pulls us out of distressing circumstances in life.

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:31.370
Jehovah rescued his people from slavery in Egypt.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:36.370
Isaiah 63 verse 9 says, during all their distress, it was distressing to him.

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:40.370
And he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old.

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:47.480
When was the last time that Jehovah rescued you from a trial?

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:58.500
In Psalm 18, David used very poetic language to describe Jehovah's remarkable ability to rescue us.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.500
Psalm 18 verses 8 through 10.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:05.500
Smoke ascended from his nostrils and a consuming fire came from his mouth.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:10.500
He made the heavens bend as he descended and thick gloom was beneath his feet.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.500
He rode on a cherub and came flying.

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.500
He swooped down on the wings of a spirit.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:18.500
Verse 16 says, he reached down from on high.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:24.809
He took hold of me and pulled me from deep waters.

00:15:24.809 --> 00:15:28.809
Verse 19, he brought me out into a place of safety.

00:15:28.809 --> 00:15:36.529
He rescued me because he was pleased with me.

00:15:36.529 --> 00:15:42.529
Can you imagine Jehovah reaching down with his right hand of righteousness and rescuing you from a trial?

00:15:42.529 --> 00:15:45.870
Why?

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:54.750
Because Jehovah loves us with all his soul, his whole being.

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:56.750
How does that make you feel?

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:59.750
Does it draw you closer to your Heavenly Father?

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:06.659
Let's consider a fourth reason we have to love Jehovah.

00:16:06.659 --> 00:16:09.659
Isaiah 42 verses 8 and 9.

00:16:09.659 --> 00:16:14.679
It says, I am Jehovah.

00:16:14.679 --> 00:16:16.679
That is my name.

00:16:16.679 --> 00:16:20.679
I give my glory to no one else, nor my praise to graven images.

00:16:20.679 --> 00:16:23.679
See, the first things have come to pass.

00:16:23.679 --> 00:16:25.679
Now I am declaring new things.

00:16:25.679 --> 00:16:28.679
Before they spring up, I tell you about them.

00:16:28.679 --> 00:16:32.889
Why is this a reason to love Jehovah?

00:16:32.889 --> 00:16:34.889
He's a God of prophecy.

00:16:34.889 --> 00:16:36.889
What does that mean in simple terms?

00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:38.889
Well, Jehovah keeps his promises.

00:16:38.889 --> 00:16:40.889
It's linked to his name, Jehovah,

00:16:40.889 --> 00:16:44.889
which we understand to mean he causes to become.

00:16:44.889 --> 00:16:51.889
Not one word of all his good promise that he made through Moses, his servant, has failed.

00:16:51.889 --> 00:16:53.889
Who said it?

00:16:53.889 --> 00:17:00.710
Well, Joshua and Solomon both expressed similar thoughts.

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:06.710
But now here we are 3000 years after Solomon.

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:09.710
We have more reasons to say that.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:12.710
More prophecies have been fulfilled since then.

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:14.710
God's kingdom rules.

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:17.710
Pure worship has been restored.

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:23.710
We can emphatically say, not one word of all Jehovah's good promises has failed.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:28.759
But how does that make us love him more?

00:17:28.759 --> 00:17:32.759
Well, prophecy is the basis for hope.

00:17:33.759 --> 00:17:41.759
So when we hear Isaiah 33, 24, or John 5, 28, and 29, or Revelation 21, 3, and 4,

00:17:41.759 --> 00:17:54.349
we think about the effect that the disappearance of sickness, pain, and death will have for us and for our loved ones.

00:17:54.349 --> 00:17:58.210
The resurrection.

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:02.710
Do you long to welcome back loved ones?

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:06.309
It's as good as done.

00:18:06.309 --> 00:18:09.309
God's personal name is a guarantee.

00:18:09.309 --> 00:18:15.309
Jehovah makes the dead alive and calls the things that are not as though they are.

00:18:15.309 --> 00:18:16.309
Why?

00:18:16.309 --> 00:18:22.660
Because his promises are absolutely certain of fulfillment.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:26.660
Jeremiah 29 verse 11.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:31.660
There, Jehovah says, I will know the thoughts that I am thinking toward you.

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:36.660
Thoughts of peace and not of calamity to give you a future and a hope.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:40.660
Let's say Jehovah loves us with all his mind.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:45.660
Jehovah will make his very own thoughts toward you a reality.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.660
How does that make you feel?

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:53.660
Well, from Isaiah's prophecy, we've considered just four reasons to love Jehovah.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:55.660
First, he's our shepherd.

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:57.660
Second, he's our creator.

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.660
Third, he's our helper.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.660
And finally, he's a God of prophecy.

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:03.660
Certainly, you can think of other reasons to love Jehovah.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:07.660
Note what a few individuals said when asked why they particularly loved Jehovah.

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:12.660
One brother said, I love Jehovah because he listens to my prayers.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:15.660
When sister said, Jehovah is approachable.

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:19.660
It's a privilege to have a friend who I can talk to at any moment of the day

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.660
and know that he will understand me.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:27.660
Another sister said, because of all the things he made for absolutely no reason

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:31.660
except that he loves us.

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.660
We don't need to taste food to survive.

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:37.660
The sunset doesn't need to be beautiful.

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:40.660
Music doesn't have to exist, but it does.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:45.660
One reason I love Jehovah is because he goes above and beyond

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:49.130
and his love for us.

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:54.130
Another brother said this, I love Jehovah for his forgiveness.

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:59.130
And really, doesn't that bring to our minds Jehovah's greatest expression of love?

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:02.130
The ransom sacrifice of his son, Jesus.

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:06.130
So the question for each of us, why do I love Jehovah?

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:09.130
Why do you love Jehovah?

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:13.130
Well, what does our love motivate us to do?

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:17.130
It's linked with the words of Isaiah chapter 43 verse 10.

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:24.269
Isaiah 43 verse 10, Jehovah says, you are my witnesses.

00:20:24.269 --> 00:20:28.269
Yes, my servant to my have chosen.

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:33.269
How thrilling it must have been in 1931 to hear brother Rutherford express

00:20:33.269 --> 00:20:40.269
the new name that we've come to cherish, 1931, Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:20:40.269 --> 00:20:44.269
And for what purpose has Jehovah chosen us as witnesses?

00:20:44.269 --> 00:20:49.269
Isaiah 43, notice verse 21, it says, the people whom I formed for myself

00:20:49.269 --> 00:20:52.269
so that they might declare my praise.

00:20:52.269 --> 00:20:55.269
Jehovah has chosen us to declare his praise.

00:20:55.269 --> 00:20:59.269
Love Jehovah, praise Jehovah.

00:20:59.269 --> 00:21:01.269
What a privilege.

00:21:01.269 --> 00:21:07.779
Jehovah could use rocks, he could use trees, he could use birds, he could use beasts of the field.

00:21:07.779 --> 00:21:14.779
But no, he's chosen his faithful servants, he's chosen you and me to declare his praise.

00:21:14.779 --> 00:21:19.779
Recently on a trip to the Western United States, my wife and I were able to observe

00:21:19.779 --> 00:21:26.779
bison, elk, and mousse from a safe distance, of course.

00:21:26.779 --> 00:21:30.779
They're humongous, very powerful animals.

00:21:30.779 --> 00:21:34.779
Well, what if Jehovah had chosen one of them to declare his praise?

00:21:34.779 --> 00:21:37.779
Every time you would approach, they would say praise jaw.

00:21:37.779 --> 00:21:43.259
But he hasn't.

00:21:43.259 --> 00:21:48.880
They just eat grass.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:54.150
They praise Jehovah in a different way.

00:21:54.150 --> 00:22:00.150
But the fact of the matter is, Jehovah has chosen us to declare his praise,

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:03.150
to extol his virtues.

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:08.150
Jehovah isn't looking for programmed praise or forced or coerced praise,

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:11.150
but praise that comes from a heart full of love.

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:19.150
Love for God's remarkable qualities motivates us to tell the whole world about our great God.

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:20.150
But many don't want to listen.

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:23.150
What if we face opposition, even from governments?

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:28.940
Isaiah 44 verse 8 is what we need to keep in mind,

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:33.940
because as we've considered already during this program,

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.940
the time will come when we're going to face opposition.

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:41.940
Isaiah 44 verse 8, some of our brothers in many places are already facing opposition.

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:43.940
Notice what it says, do not be in dread.

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.940
Do not become paralyzed with fear.

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:50.940
Have I not told each of you beforehand and declared it, you are my witnesses.

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:52.940
Is there any God but me?

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:54.940
No, there is no other rock.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:55.940
I know of none.

00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:00.220
Jehovah says, do not be in dread.

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:03.220
Do not become paralyzed with fear.

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:08.630
Payback Caesar's things to Caesar, but God's things to God.

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:13.630
Caesar is on shaky ground when he interferes with what God requires.

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:16.630
So rather than being paralyzed with fear,

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:21.630
love for Jehovah conquers fear and moves us to continue praising him.

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:26.630
And we've seized such determination in our international family of witnesses,

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:28.630
a faithful sister named Tatiana.

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:32.630
Her criminal case for praising Jehovah is pending,

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:35.630
and her husband is currently in pretrial detention.

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:41.630
But she says, during the most difficult moments, I continue to sense that Jehovah is with me

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:47.630
and I feel confident that with his help, I can endure whatever trials may yet come.

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:52.630
My heart is filled with peace and calmness.

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:56.630
I am more determined than ever to tell others about Jehovah.

00:23:56.630 --> 00:24:00.630
I am proud to be one of Jehovah's witnesses.

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:06.630
Yes, Tatiana's love for Jehovah moves her to continue praising him.

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:14.140
Well, the Bible doesn't tell us how many hours we have to share in the ministry each month.

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:19.140
But it does tell us that love for God must be our motivation.

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:24.140
The greater our love, the fuller our share will be in accord with our personal circumstances.

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:31.140
We prove that we are Jehovah's witnesses by our conduct and by our zeal in praising him formally and informally.

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:39.140
May our deep love for Jehovah move us to tell as many people as possible about our great God, Jehovah.

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:46.140
Well, the next three talks of this symposium will discuss how love for Jehovah motivated his people in ancient times.

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:52.140
The second talk or the third talk will discuss how love for Jehovah motivates his people in modern times

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:58.140
and finally how the second greatest commandment should motivate us.

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:01.140
Will we hear some adjustments?

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:05.140
Will we consider a fresh approach to our ministry?

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:07.140
Stay tuned!

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:15.140
First, we'll give our attention to Brother Garrett and Lush, a member of the governing body who will discuss the theme love for Jehovah in ancient times.

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:32.660
All of us appreciate and enjoy receiving a gift.

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:38.660
But to be able to give a gift to others brings us even more joy.

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:47.660
As the great giver of all good things, Jehovah rejoices in giving and wants humans to enjoy giving.

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:51.660
He is the first giver, he is the greatest giver.

00:25:51.660 --> 00:26:00.660
He gave life to spirit sons and to humans. He gave Adam a lovely wife. He gave them a paradise to live in.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:17.970
In turn, Adam and Eve were given the opportunity to give of their time and energy to take care of the earthly home and to spread the garden of Eden into a global paradise inhabited by righteous humans.

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:26.970
Later in human history, Jehovah created the nation of Israel and gave them a beautiful land full of good things.

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:30.970
How could the Israelites show their appreciation?

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:35.970
Jehovah again provided an opportunity for his people to give.

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:40.970
In this case, he gave them a command to tithe.

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:42.970
What is that?

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:46.970
The tithe means to give a tenth of something.

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:52.970
Israelites were to give Jehovah a tenth of all their produce and animals.

00:26:52.970 --> 00:27:00.970
We can read that account at Leviticus chapter 27 verses 30 and 32.

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:06.970
Follow me as I read from the screen verse 30 says,

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:15.970
Every tenth part of the land, whether from the produce of a field or the fruit of the trees, belongs to Jehovah.

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:18.970
It is something holy to Jehovah.

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:20.970
Verse 32 says,

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:41.380
Did you notice that Jehovah said the tithe was a holy gift that belonged to him?

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:45.380
And yet, what did Jehovah do with that tithe?

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:53.380
He generously gave it or passed it on to the tribe of the Levites who had no land inheritance.

00:27:53.380 --> 00:28:01.380
Again, follow along on the screen as I read Numbers chapter 18 verse 21.

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:14.380
Now see that I have given to the sons of Levi every tenth part in Israel as an inheritance in return for the service they are carrying out, the service of the tent of meeting.

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.380
Verse 24 says,

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:27.380
For I have given to the Levites as an inheritance, the tenth part contributed by the people of Israel, which they will contribute to Jehovah.

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:36.380
That is why I have said to them, in the midst of the Israelites, they should not take possession of an inheritance.

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:48.380
Think how this arrangement proved to be a blessing to the Levites who devoted their time and attention to Jehovah's service at the tabernacle.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:29:02.619
The arrangement also proved to be a blessing to all Israel to have one tribe completely devoted to carrying further tabernacle and later the temple of Jehovah.

00:29:02.619 --> 00:29:08.619
But how would the Levites show their appreciation and love to Jehovah?

00:29:08.619 --> 00:29:12.619
They also were commanded to tithe.

00:29:12.619 --> 00:29:26.619
According to verses 26 through 29, they would contribute a tenth of their contributions which they received to the eronic priests for their support.

00:29:26.619 --> 00:29:37.619
It seems the Israelites were also required to set aside an additional tenth to cover the expense of attending the three national festivals to Jehovah.

00:29:37.619 --> 00:29:51.480
Every third and sixth year these funds were given to the Levites, alien residents, widows and fatherless boys in the local community.

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:55.480
So what have we learned about giving and tithing?

00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:09.480
As we have seen, the tithing arrangement provided a wonderful way for God's people to show their love and appreciation for Jehovah and to support pure worship.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:22.480
Imagine also how those who were disadvantaged, the alien residents, widows and fatherless boys also appreciated this loving provision.

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:28.480
But did you know there was something else very interesting about the tithing arrangement?

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:41.480
Nowhere in the Scriptures did Jehovah arrange for any human to monitor whether each person was really giving the entire tenth of his produce and his animals.

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:48.480
And no one was assigned to enforce compliance with the tithing arrangement.

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:58.759
So although it was required by law, tithing was entirely between the individual Israelite and Jehovah.

00:30:58.759 --> 00:31:05.759
Thus the arrangement allowed each Israelite to demonstrate his personal love for Jehovah.

00:31:05.759 --> 00:31:17.009
But what if somebody secretly held back and did not give Jehovah the whole tith, perhaps giving less than a tenth?

00:31:17.009 --> 00:31:20.009
How would Jehovah feel about that?

00:31:20.009 --> 00:31:25.009
Would he be inclined to bless those who were stingy?

00:31:25.009 --> 00:31:27.009
That's not likely.

00:31:27.009 --> 00:31:35.009
On the other hand, how would Jehovah feel about those who generously gave even more than a tenth?

00:31:35.009 --> 00:31:38.009
Well, we don't have to get.

00:31:38.009 --> 00:31:45.009
Remember when Faithful King Hezekiah promoted pure worship and encouraged tithing?

00:31:45.009 --> 00:31:47.009
What happened?

00:31:47.009 --> 00:31:52.009
Let's see at 2 Chronicles chapter 31 verses 4 through 6.

00:31:52.009 --> 00:32:05.009
Furthermore, he commanded the people living in Jerusalem to give the portion to the priests and the Levites so that they might adhere strictly to the law of Jehovah.

00:32:06.009 --> 00:32:20.009
As soon as the order was issued, the Israelites gave in great quantities the first fruits of the grain, new wine, oil, and honey, and of all the produce of the field.

00:32:20.009 --> 00:32:32.009
They brought in abundantly the tenth of everything, and the people of Israel and of Judah living in the cities of Judah also brought in the tenth of cattle and sheep

00:32:32.009 --> 00:32:37.009
and the tenth of the holy things that were sanctified to Jehovah their God.

00:32:37.009 --> 00:32:41.009
They brought it in and put it in many heaps.

00:32:41.009 --> 00:32:46.009
So how did Jehovah feel about the generosity of his people?

00:32:46.009 --> 00:32:49.009
Let's note verses 9 and 10.

00:32:50.009 --> 00:32:59.009
Hezekiah asked the priests and the Levites about the heaps, and as a rye of the chief priests of the house of Zadok said to him,

00:32:59.009 --> 00:33:17.009
from the time they started bringing the contributions into the house of Jehovah, the people have been eating to satisfaction, and there is still an abundant surplus for Jehovah has blessed his people, and this great plenty is left over.

00:33:17.009 --> 00:33:24.009
Yes, Jehovah richly blessed faithful ones who generously supported the tithing arrangement.

00:33:24.009 --> 00:33:30.009
Sadly, Israel eventually lost their generous spirit and neglected the tith.

00:33:30.009 --> 00:33:41.009
So, some years later, Jehovah inspired the prophet Malachi to remind the nation of their privilege of giving.

00:33:41.009 --> 00:33:48.009
What did Jehovah say? Let's see at Malachi chapter 3 verse 10.

00:33:48.009 --> 00:33:58.009
Bring the entire tith into the storehouse so that there may be food in my house and test me out, please, in this regard.

00:33:58.009 --> 00:34:11.010
Jehovah of army says, to see whether I will not open to you the floodgates of the heavens and pour out on you a blessing until there is nothing lacking.

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:18.010
Can you imagine that it was as if Jehovah was challenging each Israelite to test him?

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:26.010
Would Jehovah really bless those who gave him the full ties so that they elect nothing?

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:34.010
Yes, absolutely. Today, of course, we are no longer under the Mosaic law with its tithing requirement,

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:43.010
rather than being commanded to give a tenth of our income, 2 Corinthians chapter 9 verse 7 says,

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:56.010
Let each one do just as he has resolved in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion for God loves a cheerful giver.

00:34:56.010 --> 00:35:05.010
So, what have we learned from our brief discussion of tithing that Jehovah created us to find joy in giving?

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:17.010
And we give generously of our time and resources because we love Jehovah, not because someone is so observing and keeping track of what we do.

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:24.010
We also learned that Jehovah richly blesses obedience that comes from hearts full of love for him.

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:36.010
But is there more that we can learn from Jehovah's dealings with ancient Israel? Yes, we can learn from the Nazarite arrangement.

00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:43.010
What was that? The Nazarite arrangement is described in Numbers chapter 6.

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:48.010
Let's read chapter 6 verses 1 and 2.

00:35:48.010 --> 00:36:03.010
It says, Jehovah spoke further to Moses and said, Speak to the Israelites and tell them if a man or a woman takes a special vow to live as a Nazarite to Jehovah.

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:16.010
Notice that Israelites, both men and women could volunteer to become a Nazarite. This meant that they had to meet certain requirements that were not imposed on Israelites in general.

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:20.010
What were those requirements?

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:38.010
Numbers chapter 6 verses 3 to 7 explains that Nazarites had to, for one, avoid alcohol and anything made from the grape wine, second, avoid cutting their hair, third, avoid touching a dead body.

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:49.010
By voluntarily submitting to these additional requirements, Nazarites demonstrated their love for Jehovah in a special way. How so?

00:36:49.010 --> 00:37:05.010
Imagine that you hire someone to perform repair work on your house. After performing the repair, the worker notices other repairs that are needed and he tells you he will do those as well at no additional charge.

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:17.010
How would you feel about this worker? Would you not appreciate his extra efforts to go beyond what he was asked to do?

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:32.010
You might even give him extra pay. And how would the worker feel? Because he is a generous person, he will experience the joy of giving more than what was asked.

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:43.010
The same was true of the Nazarites. Jehovah did not require anyone to become a Nazarite, but he created this arrangement. Why?

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:53.010
Evidently, he knew that some faithful Israelites would voluntarily submit to extra requirements out of their great love for him.

00:37:53.010 --> 00:38:00.010
And their appreciation for Jehovah would prompt them to do even more for him.

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:09.010
No doubt this brought joy to Jehovah's heart to see his people manifest a generous, appreciative spirit in this way.

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:13.010
So what can we learn from the Nazarite arrangement?

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:23.010
That Jehovah deeply appreciates and favors those who show their love for him by going beyond what is required.

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:37.010
Today, this is true of ones who have their circumstances or the circumstances to pioneer and those who are able to serve as volunteers at branch offices and in other theocratic assignments.

00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:48.010
As we know, Jehovah discontinued the Mosaic law with its provision for tithing for Nazarites and for the many animal sacrifices.

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:58.010
Colossians chapter 2 verse 14 says, Jehovah erased the handwritten document that is the law covenant.

00:38:58.010 --> 00:39:06.010
However, are there lessons we can learn from these past arrangements for supporting pure worship?

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:18.349
Yes, Romans chapter 15 verse 4 reminds us that all the things that were written beforehand were written for our instruction.

00:39:18.349 --> 00:39:27.349
So does Jehovah's organization today benefit from the principles behind the tithing and Nazarite arrangements?

00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:34.349
How do we as individuals support modern-day arrangements for pure worship?

00:39:34.349 --> 00:39:44.349
And does a closer examination of the arrangements for pure worship in ancient Israel indicate a need for further adjustments today?

00:39:44.349 --> 00:39:59.349
For the answers to these questions, let us give our attention to Brother Samuel Hurd, a member of the governing body who will share the next talk in this symposium entitled Love for Jehovah in Modern Times.

00:39:59.349 --> 00:40:24.409
As you listen to Brother Lose discuss the arrangement for tithing and Nazarite shit, did you try to make a connection with arrangements that we have for modern-day worship?

00:40:25.409 --> 00:40:30.409
Maybe you were wondering, what corresponds to tithing today?

00:40:30.409 --> 00:40:46.409
As Brother Lose mentioned, although tithing was a requirement for the Israelites, it also provided Jehovah's people with regular opportunities to demonstrate their love for Jehovah by giving him their best.

00:40:46.409 --> 00:40:53.409
Of course, we no longer have a fixed amount of our income that we are commanded to give to Jehovah.

00:40:53.409 --> 00:41:03.409
The tithing arrangement ended with the mosaic law, and Galatians chapter 6, verse 2, says we are now under the law of the Christ.

00:41:03.409 --> 00:41:11.409
True Christians today give Jehovah just as they have resolved in their hearts.

00:41:11.409 --> 00:41:18.409
But the tithing arrangement illustrates something that Jehovah still expects of his people today.

00:41:19.409 --> 00:41:28.409
Remember the tith was to be not just a tith, but the best tith of a person's produce and his animals.

00:41:28.409 --> 00:41:33.409
Jehovah deserves nothing less than our very best.

00:41:33.409 --> 00:41:38.409
With that in mind, how can we give Jehovah our very best?

00:41:38.409 --> 00:41:50.409
Of course, we try hard to obey all of Jehovah's commands, but there is one command that stands out as an identifying mark of true Christians today.

00:41:50.409 --> 00:41:52.409
What is it?

00:41:52.409 --> 00:41:59.409
Let's read it together on screen at Matthew chapter 28, verses 19 and 20.

00:41:59.409 --> 00:42:14.409
He says, go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,

00:42:14.409 --> 00:42:19.409
teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.

00:42:19.409 --> 00:42:28.409
And look, I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.

00:42:28.409 --> 00:42:34.409
Were you surprised that we read that verse? Of course not.

00:42:34.409 --> 00:42:41.409
We see from these verses that the disciples making work is a requirement for all Christians.

00:42:41.409 --> 00:42:46.409
And your dear brothers and sisters have built your lives around that scripture.

00:42:46.409 --> 00:42:55.409
You have given and continued to give your very best to obey this life-saving command.

00:42:56.409 --> 00:43:00.659
And we commend you for that.

00:43:00.659 --> 00:43:10.659
Jehovah's organization has always been interested in seeing how this great worldwide work has been progressing.

00:43:10.659 --> 00:43:19.659
We enjoy seeing our annual report published each year as we see the number of kingdom publishers increasing.

00:43:19.659 --> 00:43:29.659
The worldwide report helps the governing body to see where to send missionaries, special pioneers and pioneers.

00:43:29.659 --> 00:43:40.630
Let's watch a video that highlights how Jehovah's people have taken this commission seriously over the years.

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:43.630
When did we begin reporting field service activity?

00:43:43.630 --> 00:44:02.420
Prior to 1920, only coal quarters, as pioneers were then called, were asked to submit reports.

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:13.469
But beginning in 1920, everyone in the congregation who participated in the witness work was asked to turn in a weekly report.

00:44:13.469 --> 00:44:21.469
The 1920 annual service report for the United States was the first to include the activity of congregation publishers.

00:44:21.469 --> 00:44:32.469
That report revealed that there were 8,052 class workers or publishers and 350 pioneers active in the preaching work.

00:44:32.469 --> 00:44:40.469
Twice a year during the late 1920s, one week was designated for a special worldwide witnessing campaign.

00:44:40.469 --> 00:44:44.469
Pioneers had a goal of 40 hours for that special week.

00:44:44.469 --> 00:44:53.260
In January 1939, a suggestion was placed before congregation publishers.

00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:57.260
A goal of 60 hours per month.

00:44:57.260 --> 00:45:04.260
Early on, congregation field service reports were thorough.

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:10.260
Over the years, the forms used to report publisher's field service activity have been simplified.

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:20.260
Reports have consistently included back calls or return visits, Bible studies, publication placements and hours spent in the disciple making work.

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:27.260
As was the case back then, there's always a story behind a field service report.

00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:34.260
The first time I walked into a kingdom hall, when I was 16, I saw this chart on the stage.

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:44.260
And I realized this organization is concerned about what we do, what we say, and how much we say about Jehovah.

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:47.260
I realized that from the start.

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:53.260
So that after the third month of studying, when I started going out in field service, I wanted to turn my time in too.

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:57.260
And they showed me how to do it, and I've been turning it ever since.

00:45:57.260 --> 00:46:04.570
Ellen and I were invited into the special pioneer service in 1966.

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:08.570
The monthly requirement was 150 hours and 50 return visits.

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:10.570
It was a good incentive.

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:15.570
What we had a quota back then of 150 magazines, one for every hour,

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:17.570
a special pioneers or missionaries.

00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:23.570
And one day we run into our fellow missionary and his wife on the way to the movies.

00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:27.570
They went every Saturday, every Saturday, but this particular Saturday says,

00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:31.570
I can't go to the movies because I don't have my 150 magazines.

00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:35.570
So I've got five more to go, and then we can go to the movies.

00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:38.570
Let's start in 1961.

00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:41.570
We were sent a special pioneer.

00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:48.570
Third pioneer in a trailer of five hours of service every day.

00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:53.570
And getting our time was no problem.

00:46:53.570 --> 00:46:59.570
Living for a month or $100, that was a problem.

00:46:59.570 --> 00:47:03.570
So Dave said, I'm going to go out and get a job.

00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:07.570
By that time they had put a new store in town, beautiful.

00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:12.570
He would now do that store and told them, I'm going to work one day a week.

00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:16.570
What are you going to do the rest of the time?

00:47:16.570 --> 00:47:23.570
So he said, well, I knock on doors and tell them about God's kingdom.

00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:27.570
It's really, this is my door.

00:47:27.570 --> 00:47:29.570
Knock on it.

00:47:29.570 --> 00:47:32.570
He came in the truth. His wife came in the truth.

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:34.570
Children are in the truth.

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:38.570
And they had a secretary, didn't they?

00:47:38.570 --> 00:47:40.570
She had seven children.

00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:45.570
And she said, well, I'd like to study the Bible too.

00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:49.570
And we would study with seven after they had supper.

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:52.570
The beauty of it is that they did so well.

00:47:52.570 --> 00:47:57.570
Yeah. After that, we studied with the parents.

00:47:57.570 --> 00:48:02.570
So by the time we got through it, it was probably almost midnight.

00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:05.570
And we took our circuit over to you there.

00:48:05.570 --> 00:48:09.570
And he said, I'm too old for this midnight shift.

00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:12.570
I never felt it was a question of getting the hours in.

00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:15.570
I always try to make them quality calls, you know,

00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:18.570
try to say something with the people.

00:48:18.570 --> 00:48:21.570
Not just go there and get the magazines placed.

00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:26.570
Or my Bible studies, I would try so hard to really get to know the people.

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:29.570
But it was never just a question of getting an hours.

00:48:29.570 --> 00:48:31.570
We're trying to save lives.

00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:39.829
Isn't that wonderful to hear from those dear faithful ones?

00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:43.829
And Brother Butel is now 100 years of age.

00:48:43.829 --> 00:48:46.829
And Sister Butel is 98.

00:48:46.829 --> 00:48:52.829
What a good start on living forever.

00:48:52.829 --> 00:48:56.829
As we've seen, the arrangement for reporting our field activity

00:48:56.829 --> 00:49:01.829
has served a valuable purpose for many years.

00:49:01.829 --> 00:49:06.829
However, as Brother Flegal mentioned in the opening talk of this symposium,

00:49:06.829 --> 00:49:12.829
Jehovah's people are motivated to praise Jehovah because of our great love for him.

00:49:12.829 --> 00:49:18.829
Sharing in the ministry also reflects our sincere love for our neighbors

00:49:18.829 --> 00:49:22.829
and our love for the good news.

00:49:22.829 --> 00:49:27.829
We engage in our ministry not because we fill out a report each month.

00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:36.829
We might say that our ministry is our personal gift to Jehovah and to our neighbors.

00:49:36.829 --> 00:49:38.829
But Jehovah is realistic.

00:49:38.829 --> 00:49:44.829
He knows that many of our brothers and sisters are limited by circumstances,

00:49:44.829 --> 00:49:49.829
such as advancing age or serious health issues.

00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:58.829
Others cope with the rising cost of living, civil strife, war, or opposition to our work.

00:49:58.829 --> 00:50:07.829
The reason COVID-19 pandemic greatly limited what many of us were able to do in the ministry.

00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:16.829
Some who have preached faithfully for decades may be embarrassed to report little time in the ministry.

00:50:16.829 --> 00:50:24.829
If that is true, you should you feel that you have failed in some way, not at all.

00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:30.829
Note the principle at 2 Corinthians chapter 8 verse 12.

00:50:30.829 --> 00:50:39.829
For if the readiness is there first, it is especially acceptable according to what a person has,

00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:44.829
not according to what a person does not have.

00:50:44.829 --> 00:50:50.829
If we're giving Jehovah our best, he wants us to rejoice in what we do,

00:50:50.829 --> 00:50:54.829
not to feel guilty about what we cannot do.

00:50:54.829 --> 00:51:00.829
The Scriptures associate sacrifices to Jehovah with joy.

00:51:00.829 --> 00:51:06.829
For example, Nehemiah chapter 12 verse 43 says,

00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:11.829
On that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced.

00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:18.829
For the true God made them rejoice with great joy.

00:51:18.829 --> 00:51:27.829
Can you imagine Jehovah judging an Israelite unfaithful because his tenth was less than another person's tenth?

00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:29.829
Of course not.

00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:33.829
Everyone's circumstances and abilities are different.

00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:39.829
Brother Loish explained that although tithing was a requirement in ancient Israel,

00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:47.829
Jehovah did not require others to monitor or keep track of each person's tithing.

00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:52.829
Tithing was entirely between the individual Israelite and Jehovah.

00:51:52.829 --> 00:52:03.619
The governing body believes this same principle can be applied when it comes to reporting our time spent in the ministry.

00:52:03.619 --> 00:52:12.579
Our ministry involves much more than counting time for this reason.

00:52:12.579 --> 00:52:18.579
We are pleased to announce that beginning November 1st, 2023.

00:52:18.579 --> 00:52:29.579
Congregation publishers will no longer be asked to report the amount of time they spend in the ministry.

00:52:29.579 --> 00:52:34.579
Nor will publishers be asked to report their placements.

00:52:34.579 --> 00:52:39.579
The videos they show are their return visits.

00:52:39.579 --> 00:52:55.579
Instead, the field service report will simply have a box that will allow each publisher to indicate that he or she shared in any form of the ministry during the month.

00:52:55.579 --> 00:53:04.860
There will be one more box where publishers report the number of different Bible studies they conduct.

00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:09.860
This simplified report serves a valuable purpose.

00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:15.860
It will allow us to know the number of active publishers in each land.

00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:32.260
It will also help us to know whether certain territories are producing Bible studies and where there is a greater need for pioneers, special pioneers, missionaries, and Kingdom Hall.

00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:45.260
Although publishers will no longer report their time in the ministry, we all want to follow faithfully the words of Colossians chapter 3, verses 23 and 24.

00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:57.610
Whatever you're doing, work at at whole soul as for Jehovah and not for men.

00:53:57.610 --> 00:54:05.610
For you know that it is from Jehovah, you will receive the inheritance as a reward.

00:54:05.610 --> 00:54:08.610
Slay for the master Christ.

00:54:08.610 --> 00:54:19.610
The governing body is confident that you dear ones will continue to render whole soul service to Jehovah by doing all that you can in his service.

00:54:19.610 --> 00:54:33.610
And just as Jehovah richly blessed faithful Israelites who generously supported the tithing arrangement, he will richly bless your sacrifice appraise.

00:54:33.610 --> 00:54:38.610
But wait, what about the Nazarite arrangement?

00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:43.610
Is there a similar provision in the modern day organization? Certainly.

00:54:43.610 --> 00:54:51.610
We all do well to imitate the Nazarites example of self-sacrifice and courage.

00:54:51.610 --> 00:55:02.610
However, as Brother Loesch explained, the Nazarites had to meet certain requirements that were not expected of Israelites in general.

00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:06.610
The same is true of modern-day pioneers.

00:55:06.610 --> 00:55:12.610
They have volunteered to devote a certain number of hours to spend in the ministry.

00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:35.610
Thus, auxiliary and regular pioneers, special pioneers, missionaries and circuit overseers and their wives will continue to report the number of hours they spend in the ministry, along with the number of different Bible studies they conduct.

00:55:35.610 --> 00:55:51.610
As you know, the governing body recently reduced the hour requirements for auxiliary pioneers, regular pioneers, special pioneers, field missionaries and circuit overseers and their wives.

00:55:51.610 --> 00:56:01.610
It gave us great joy to do that and we are convinced that as a result, even more will be able to join the ranks of the pioneers.

00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:10.610
Why are we so confident of that? Because of what it says at Psalm 110, verse 3,

00:56:10.610 --> 00:56:19.610
your people will offer themselves willingly on the day of your military force.

00:56:19.610 --> 00:56:29.610
Yes, Jehovah promises that his people and young ones in particular would reach out to do more in this time of the end.

00:56:29.610 --> 00:56:34.610
Many pioneers eventually attend the school for kingdom evangelizers.

00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:41.610
They become special pioneers, field missionaries and even circuit overseers with their wives.

00:56:41.610 --> 00:56:48.610
We thank Jehovah for those who reach out to serve as pioneers.

00:56:48.610 --> 00:56:55.610
But let's thank for a moment what this adjustment will mean for all of us.

00:56:56.610 --> 00:57:03.610
Isn't it true that reporting our field service activity each month has served as a reminder?

00:57:03.610 --> 00:57:13.610
Our monthly report reminded us to be regular in the ministry, to use our various publications and videos and to make return visits.

00:57:13.610 --> 00:57:16.610
But what about now?

00:57:16.610 --> 00:57:24.610
Will we still be conscientious about having an active share in the ministry each month?

00:57:24.610 --> 00:57:33.610
Remember that with the tithing arrangement, each individual was responsible to give their full tie to Jehovah.

00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:42.610
Likewise, each of us will want to set personal goals to make sure we have a zealous share in the ministry.

00:57:42.610 --> 00:57:56.110
Love for Jehovah will move us to have a schedule to make sure the ministry continues to take priority in our lives.

00:57:56.110 --> 00:58:05.110
What will these adjustments in reporting our ministry mean for you elders and circuit overseers?

00:58:05.110 --> 00:58:12.110
It will be even more important that you brothers be discerning shepherds.

00:58:12.110 --> 00:58:34.110
You will have to know the flock well, for example, evaluating a congregation's spiritual health or a brother's qualifications to serve as an elder or ministerial servant will not simply be a matter of computing averages, time spent in the ministry, literature placements, and so forth.

00:58:34.110 --> 00:58:39.110
No, you will have to know the brothers.

00:58:39.110 --> 00:58:43.110
What is their attitude toward the ministry?

00:58:43.110 --> 00:58:47.110
Are they zealous for pure worship?

00:58:47.110 --> 00:58:52.110
What is their reputation in regard to the ministry?

00:58:52.110 --> 00:58:57.110
Do they take advantage of opportunities to give a witness?

00:58:57.110 --> 00:59:03.710
Do they help others to do so, including the members of their family?

00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:18.710
As we have discussed, Jehovah clearly deserves our best, and we demonstrate our love for him by exerting ourselves in the ministry and in all other aspects of our worship.

00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:24.710
Jehovah loves you for that, and we love you for that.

00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:32.710
We know you will continue to manifest the spirit expressed at Psalm 54 verse 6.

00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:37.710
It says, I will sacrifice to you willingly.

00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:44.710
I will praise your name, old Jehovah, for it is good.

00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:54.710
So we have no doubt that you will continue to give Jehovah your very best in the disciple-making work.

00:59:54.710 --> 01:00:01.710
But is there still more we can learn from the scriptures about the way we conduct our ministry?

01:00:01.710 --> 01:00:07.710
If so, are additional adjustments appropriate at this time?

01:00:07.710 --> 01:00:22.710
To find out, let us give our attention to Brother Mark Sanderson, a member of the Governing Body, who will share the final talk in this symposium entitled Love People Make Disciples.

01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:52.230
Well, brothers and sisters, hasn't this been an amazing program?

01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:58.230
This is truly a historic day in the history of Jehovah's Witnesses.

01:00:59.230 --> 01:01:08.230
And maybe our hearts right now are more full of love and appreciation for our wonderful God, Jehovah, than ever before.

01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:16.230
We've deepened our understanding of Jehovah's mercy, his compassion, and his patience.

01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:21.230
And what about that announcement about our field service reporting?

01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:28.230
Jehovah is dignifying us. He has confidence in us.

01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:33.230
You see, why do we go from house to house? Why do we do cart work?

01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:39.230
Why do we make telephone calls and write letters and make return visits and start Bible studies?

01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:50.230
Why do we do all of these things? It's because we truly love our amazing and wonderful God, Jehovah.

01:01:50.230 --> 01:02:01.230
As Brother Flegal emphasized in his talk, at Matthew 22 and verse 37, Jesus identified the greatest and first commandment.

01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:14.230
You remember what he said? You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:21.230
But is there something else that moves us to make disciples? Yes.

01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:32.230
It's what Jesus said was the second greatest commandment. Jesus said, you must love your neighbor as yourself.

01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:38.230
So we must love God, but we must also love people.

01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:52.230
Now why is love for people so important? Well, because when we see that someone cares about us, we are moved even if we don't know that person.

01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:59.230
For example, maybe someone you've never met before does a kind deed for you. Maybe they open a door for you.

01:02:59.230 --> 01:03:06.230
They pick something up that you've dropped or they help you carry a heavy load. How do you feel?

01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:18.230
Well, you appreciate their kindness, don't you? And as a result, you're more inclined to want to listen to what that person might want to say to you.

01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:31.230
You see, when we sense that someone has love for us, we open up our hearts. Well, unselfish love is so powerful.

01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:38.230
It touches the hearts of those who are rightly disposed for everlasting life.

01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:49.230
And Jesus said that his true disciples would be identified. They'd be recognized by the love that they had in their midst.

01:03:49.230 --> 01:04:04.230
Well, isn't it true that so often brothers and sisters say that what it was that drew them to the truth was the love they felt from their Bible teacher or from the congregation when they began to attend meetings?

01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:14.230
Well, very likely that same love was what drew you to want to become a disciple of Christ Jesus.

01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:25.230
Well, for that reason, at the 2017 annual meeting, the governing body encouraged us to begin to think more about conversing with people.

01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:37.230
And at that same meeting, you remember we simplified our teaching toolbox so that we could become more familiar with the various tools that we use in the ministry.

01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:55.230
You see, we want to carefully consider each individual's personal situation, the concerns that they have, the interests that they have, and then be flexible in choosing a topic that we want to discuss with them.

01:04:56.230 --> 01:05:13.230
Well, for several years now, our midweek meetings have provided us with sample conversations, with suggested scriptures, and even with a suggested link to help us to continue the conversation at a later time.

01:05:13.230 --> 01:05:19.230
But is there a challenge sometimes with a memorized presentation?

01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:25.230
You know, I think back when I was a brand new pioneer, one day I was out with his sister in the ministry.

01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:32.230
As we were going to the door, you know, she was actually mouthing her presentation. She had it perfectly memorized.

01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:41.230
And suddenly this woman came to the door, she opened the door, and here she was, beautiful older lady, hair done, makeup on, beautifully dressed, looking like she was just going out.

01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:46.230
The sister was so flustered, she said, oh, I'm sorry, did we get you out of bed?

01:05:46.230 --> 01:06:07.739
Yeah, memorized presentations. Not always good. Well, maybe we've memorized presentations, and sometimes we felt like we're giving a talk when we're at the door.

01:06:07.739 --> 01:06:18.739
But what if the person has a very specific interest? What if they have some special need, or they're facing some terrible challenge just at the time when we're calling?

01:06:19.739 --> 01:06:26.739
Well, we want to look to the example of our Lord Jesus Christ. He set the perfect example for us.

01:06:26.739 --> 01:06:40.739
He showed love for people by choosing subjects that were appropriate for each individual, and his personal interest in individuals attracted people to the message.

01:06:40.739 --> 01:06:47.739
Well, for example, do you remember the time when Jesus had a conversation with the Pharisee Nicodemus?

01:06:47.739 --> 01:06:57.739
Now, Nicodemus was impressed by Jesus' miracles, and he approached Jesus at night probably because he was afraid of the Jews.

01:06:57.739 --> 01:07:07.739
Now, as a Pharisee and a teacher, Nicodemus evidently must have had a very great knowledge of the Hebrew scriptures, so what did Jesus do?

01:07:07.739 --> 01:07:12.739
Well, he shared something with Nicodemus that was completely new.

01:07:12.739 --> 01:07:19.739
You see, he talked about new truths about being born again, and about seeing the kingdom of God.

01:07:19.739 --> 01:07:32.739
He explained to Nicodemus that he had descended from the heavens, and that he was the only begotten Son of God, and that he was the way to everlasting life.

01:07:32.739 --> 01:07:42.739
Well, I'm sure you'd agree that even though Nicodemus was a teacher, he received quite an education from Jesus on that night.

01:07:42.739 --> 01:07:49.739
But now, does that mean that Jesus took exactly that same approach with everyone that he met?

01:07:49.739 --> 01:07:58.739
Well, no, not at all. You see, on another occasion, when Jesus spoke to the Samaritan woman, his approach was completely different.

01:07:58.739 --> 01:08:06.739
Evidently, the Samaritan woman had a very basic knowledge of the Hebrew scriptures, so what did Jesus do?

01:08:06.739 --> 01:08:16.739
Well, he noted the things she was interested in, like obtaining water, and why Jesus, as a Jew, would speak with a Samaritan.

01:08:16.739 --> 01:08:20.739
Well, Jesus also took an interest in her family situation.

01:08:20.739 --> 01:08:29.739
He noted that she was very concerned about why did Jews worship in one location and Samaritans in a different location?

01:08:29.739 --> 01:08:31.739
What did Jesus do?

01:08:31.739 --> 01:08:37.739
Well, he talked with her about the things that interested her that were of concern to her.

01:08:37.739 --> 01:08:46.739
He helped her to see that worshiping was spirit and truth was more important than the location where individuals would worship.

01:08:46.739 --> 01:08:49.739
And how did that woman respond?

01:08:49.739 --> 01:08:58.739
Well, the Bible says she left her water jar there at the well, she went into the city, and she gave a powerful witness about Jesus.

01:08:58.739 --> 01:09:07.739
She was so effective that the Samaritans invited Jesus to stay, and many put faith in him.

01:09:07.739 --> 01:09:11.739
So now, what do we learn from these two simple accounts?

01:09:12.739 --> 01:09:16.739
Well, Jesus did not use a memorized presentation.

01:09:16.739 --> 01:09:24.739
He just talked with people, and he shared with them the truths that he knew would touch their hearts.

01:09:24.739 --> 01:09:35.739
He was very quick to choose topics and words based on the interests and the concerns of the person that he was speaking to.

01:09:35.739 --> 01:09:44.739
Well, now, with all of this in mind, you may be wondering what you're supposed to be wondering about.

01:09:44.739 --> 01:09:51.180
How can I display that same love for the people that I meet?

01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:59.180
See, wouldn't it be wonderful to have a little bit more help to see how we can show love for people and make disciples?

01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:12.180
See, wouldn't it be wonderful to have a publication that would help us to be more flexible and more responsive to the different needs and interests of the people that we meet?

01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:25.180
And what if that publication highlighted specific ways that Jesus and other first century evangelizers showed their love as they made disciples?

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:36.500
Well, you will be happy to know that Jehovah's organization has produced just such a publication.

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:43.500
It's a 32-page brochure entitled, Love People Make Disciples.

01:10:43.500 --> 01:11:15.470
But now, would you like to see a little preview of what this brochure contains?

01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:20.390
Please watch the following video.

01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:30.390
This new publication, Love People Make Disciples, is being made available in both print and digital formats in over 400 languages.

01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:36.390
How is the brochure designed to help us show love for people we meet?

01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:49.119
Unlike the tools we've used in the past, this new brochure does not give us expressions to memorize, nor does it put the emphasis on leaving literature.

01:11:49.119 --> 01:11:57.119
Rather, it features 12 lessons that focus on qualities we need to cultivate to make disciples.

01:11:57.119 --> 01:12:07.119
All the lessons are based on Bible accounts, in which Jesus or another first century evangelizer displayed a specific quality in the ministry.

01:12:07.119 --> 01:12:14.119
The lessons will help us see how we can imitate the qualities they demonstrated as we make disciples.

01:12:14.119 --> 01:12:32.899
Each lesson contains a video that brings the account to life. A woman of Samaria came to draw water.

01:12:32.899 --> 01:12:38.520
Give me a drink.

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:43.520
By cultivating an interest in people, we can talk about things that are on their minds.

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:49.960
What truths might we share with people once a conversation is started?

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:55.960
Appendix A highlights basic Bible truths that we love to teach.

01:12:55.960 --> 01:13:01.960
Make it your goal to learn these basic truths and the scriptures that support them.

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:07.960
If you do, you will be more effective in starting conversations and in making disciples.

01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:13.960
For example, a conversation can be started by asking a simple question, such as,

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:23.960
have you heard that God will soon end all suffering? Or, did you know that the earth's environment will be restored?

01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:36.119
Sharing a simple truth at the right time is powerful. Jesus said his sheep would listen to his voice.

01:13:36.119 --> 01:13:44.119
In other words, rightly disposed ones will recognize the truth when they hear it expressed simply.

01:13:44.119 --> 01:13:49.119
Appendix B helps us to determine whether to continue a conversation.

01:13:49.119 --> 01:13:57.119
Appendix C provides practical suggestions on how to conduct Bible studies and enjoy life forever.

01:13:57.119 --> 01:14:02.119
What if you don't feel comfortable starting conversations? Don't worry.

01:14:02.119 --> 01:14:13.119
Beginning in January 2024, the apply yourself portion of each midweek meeting will help us to practice the points we are learning in this new brochure.

01:14:13.119 --> 01:14:19.119
The meeting will no longer focus on presenting a predetermined topic in scripture.

01:14:19.119 --> 01:14:26.119
Rather, students will select topics for their assignments that they know are on the minds of those in their community.

01:14:26.119 --> 01:14:46.500
By means of realistic demonstrations, audience discussions, and talks, our meetings will assist us to develop skills that will help us start conversations naturally and adapt to each person's concerns and needs.

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:57.010
By focusing on people, we will become more comfortable and more effective as we make disciples.

01:14:57.010 --> 01:15:06.010
As you consider each lesson, think carefully about how you can demonstrate the highlighted qualities when conversing with people in your community.

01:15:06.010 --> 01:15:11.010
Ask yourself, what are their concerns and needs?

01:15:11.010 --> 01:15:15.010
As you go about your activities, be observant.

01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:21.010
Look for appropriate opportunities to help people in practical ways.

01:15:21.010 --> 01:15:26.010
Acts of kindness can open the door to share kingdom truth.

01:15:26.010 --> 01:15:33.010
Show that you care by listening to others when they express themselves.

01:15:33.010 --> 01:15:37.010
Share a simple truth at the right time.

01:15:37.010 --> 01:15:46.010
Remember, our goal is not to memorize a presentation, but to demonstrate Christ's like love to everyone we meet.

01:15:46.010 --> 01:15:55.460
This will require patience, perseverance, and commitment.

01:15:55.460 --> 01:16:07.939
No matter where we live, or under what circumstances we are preaching, simply showing love will help us to find joy in our ministry.

01:16:07.939 --> 01:16:20.840
More than any specific technique, actively expressing our love for others will help us make disciples.

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:51.600
We indeed thank Jehovah for this wonderful new tool to make us more effective in our ministry.

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:59.600
Of course, the question you may be wondering is, when will you receive your copy of this new brochure?

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:13.600
Well, you'll be pleased to know that it's going to be made available to all congregations in electronic format and in most places in printed format by November 6.

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:22.600
In addition, this entire four-part symposium will be posted on JW.org on November 6.

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:30.600
So that all of our brothers and sisters will hear the information in this symposium at the same time.

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:36.149
Isn't that great?

01:17:36.149 --> 01:17:39.149
Of course, we're all going to want to read the brochure.

01:17:39.149 --> 01:17:41.149
We're going to want to watch the videos.

01:17:41.149 --> 01:17:52.149
But wasn't it wonderful to hear in this video that the governing body has arranged to make use of this new publication beginning in the month of January during our midweek meeting?

01:17:52.149 --> 01:17:57.149
So we're going to get the opportunity to put this into practice right away.

01:17:57.149 --> 01:18:01.149
So what have we learned in this four-part symposium?

01:18:01.149 --> 01:18:10.149
In Part 1, Brother Flegal reminded us why we love Jehovah and how our love motivates us to want to praise him.

01:18:10.149 --> 01:18:18.149
In Part 2, Brother Losh explained the differences between most Israelites and those who volunteered to be Nazarites.

01:18:18.149 --> 01:18:34.149
In Part 3, Brother Heard helped us to see that although congregation publishers will no longer report their time in the ministry, this in no way diminishes our individual responsibility to make disciples.

01:18:34.149 --> 01:18:44.149
And finally, in this part, we received a new tool that will help us to show our love for people and to make disciples.

01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:53.149
It's really amazing to witness, as Jehovah's people, the fulfillment of Isaiah chapter 60 and verse 17.

01:18:53.149 --> 01:18:57.659
You remember the prophecy there?

01:18:57.659 --> 01:19:12.659
It says, instead of the copper, I will bring in gold, and instead of the iron, I will bring in silver, instead of the wood, copper, and instead of the stones, iron.

01:19:12.659 --> 01:19:20.659
And I will appoint peace as your overseers and righteousness as your task assigners.

01:19:20.659 --> 01:19:23.659
Well, what's the point of the prophecy?

01:19:23.659 --> 01:19:32.659
You see it outlines that good materials would gradually be replaced by even better ones.

01:19:32.659 --> 01:19:35.659
And that's exactly what we have seen.

01:19:35.659 --> 01:19:45.659
I think back in the 1930s, when our brothers became so zealous in the ministry, they went out with phonographs and testimony cards.

01:19:45.659 --> 01:19:48.659
But of course, at that time, they didn't speak.

01:19:48.659 --> 01:19:52.659
Either the record did the speaking or people read the card.

01:19:52.659 --> 01:19:57.659
My mother loved to tell the story about being in the service with her pioneer partner.

01:19:57.659 --> 01:20:00.659
The door opened, she handed the man the testimony card.

01:20:00.659 --> 01:20:02.659
Of course, it didn't say anything.

01:20:02.659 --> 01:20:08.659
The man started to read it, suddenly his wife called out, who's at the door?

01:20:08.659 --> 01:20:19.069
The man said, I don't know, there's two deaf women here, and I'm trying to figure out what they want.

01:20:19.069 --> 01:20:23.069
Well, that was the reality.

01:20:23.069 --> 01:20:26.069
We weren't speaking.

01:20:26.069 --> 01:20:29.069
But how Jehovah improved the situation?

01:20:29.069 --> 01:20:34.069
He trained his people how to give an effective witness.

01:20:34.069 --> 01:20:42.069
And then we had publications like reasoning from the scriptures that helped us to learn how to use the Bible to reason with people.

01:20:42.069 --> 01:20:52.069
And more recently, Jehovah has given us this marvelous tool, enjoy life forever so that we can conduct much more quality Bible studies.

01:20:52.069 --> 01:21:03.069
And now with the release of this brochure, we're going to focus on people and talk about the things that are of interest to them.

01:21:03.069 --> 01:21:09.069
And in that way, endeavor to reach their heart so that they can become disciples.

01:21:09.069 --> 01:21:11.069
Well, it's true.

01:21:11.069 --> 01:21:17.069
With each of these organizational adjustments, we went from something good to something better.

01:21:18.069 --> 01:21:24.069
And I think with the things that were announced today, isn't it true that we're seeing that again?

01:21:24.069 --> 01:21:28.069
We're going from something that was good to something even better.

01:21:28.069 --> 01:21:35.069
And I think we'd agree, too, that Jehovah is helping us to mature as a people.

01:21:35.069 --> 01:21:45.069
He has confidence in us that our concern is not merely the number of hours or the publications that we place that we're going to put on a report.

01:21:45.069 --> 01:21:52.069
We love Jehovah, we love people, and we want to make disciples.

01:21:52.069 --> 01:21:55.069
And so what does all of this mean?

01:21:55.069 --> 01:21:58.069
And what does it not mean?

01:21:58.069 --> 01:22:09.069
Well, first, these adjustments do not, they do not mean that we are in any way slacking off in our ministry.

01:22:09.069 --> 01:22:15.069
It does not mean that we are slowing down as we approach the Great Tribulation.

01:22:15.069 --> 01:22:18.069
Nothing could be further from the truth.

01:22:18.069 --> 01:22:27.069
Right now, we have more than 50,000 applications from students who want to attend the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

01:22:27.069 --> 01:22:33.069
We're appointing new missionaries, new special pioneers and temporary special pioneers,

01:22:33.069 --> 01:22:38.069
and an army of new regular pioneers.

01:22:38.069 --> 01:22:44.069
And in some lands like the Philippines, sorry, I have to mention the Philippines,

01:22:44.069 --> 01:22:47.069
we're experiencing record growth.

01:22:47.069 --> 01:22:58.069
Can you imagine a 9% increase this year with a new peak of 253,876 publishers

01:22:58.069 --> 01:23:05.069
and 12,954 baptized just in this last year?

01:23:05.069 --> 01:23:17.989
Isn't that amazing?

01:23:17.989 --> 01:23:25.989
So please know, please know that in no way is the work slowing down.

01:23:25.989 --> 01:23:31.989
Our ministry has never been more important than it is now.

01:23:31.989 --> 01:23:35.989
So what then do these adjustments mean?

01:23:35.989 --> 01:23:43.989
Well, they do mean that our motivation for carrying out the ministry has been even more clarified.

01:23:43.989 --> 01:23:49.989
You see, we share in the ministry because we love Jehovah and because we love people.

01:23:49.989 --> 01:23:55.989
So this is the time when we want to be busy in Jehovah's work.

01:23:55.989 --> 01:24:00.989
Do you remember Jesus' parable of the master and the three slaves?

01:24:00.989 --> 01:24:07.989
That parable was designed to teach us what we need to be doing while we're waiting for the end to come.

01:24:07.989 --> 01:24:13.989
Two of those slaves were industrious and they doubled the master's money.

01:24:13.989 --> 01:24:17.989
And as a result, they were blessed.

01:24:17.989 --> 01:24:23.989
We want to have that same industrious, diligent spirit.

01:24:23.989 --> 01:24:29.989
We want elders and ministerial servants and pioneers to take the lead in the ministry.

01:24:29.989 --> 01:24:41.989
But all of us, we all in our personal ministry want to be even more zealous in what we want to accomplish in our ministry.

01:24:41.989 --> 01:24:46.989
What an exciting time this is.

01:24:46.989 --> 01:24:55.989
The governing body sincerely hopes that many more will come to join us in serving Jehovah before the end comes.

01:24:55.989 --> 01:25:04.989
And remember, Jehovah delights in rewarding his people for their faithfulness and for their generosity.

01:25:04.989 --> 01:25:24.989
So with the great tribulation fast approaching, have no doubt that Jehovah will soon richly reward you as we all give generously of our time and our effort to love our amazing God, Jehovah, and to make disciples.

01:25:24.989 --> 01:25:30.989
As you are able to see, part one is of historical proportions and most exciting.

01:25:30.989 --> 01:25:35.989
Part two will be available on jw.org in January.

01:25:35.989 --> 01:25:42.989
Our postcard for this month is from Albania, a small country on the Adriatic Sea.

01:25:42.989 --> 01:25:52.989
For much of its tumultuous past, foreign powers have come and gone, each bringing with it a different mix of peoples, cultures, and religions.

01:25:52.989 --> 01:25:58.989
Albania is a beautiful land, scattered with lakes and crisscrossed by rivers,

01:25:58.989 --> 01:26:07.989
idealic beaches dot the coastline, such as the aptly named Aquarium Beach, a beautiful spot for snorkeling.

01:26:07.989 --> 01:26:19.989
The cat of a star Lagoon, the largest in the country, is the home of the Dalmatian Pelican, the largest of its kind, measuring up to 1.8 meters long.

01:26:19.989 --> 01:26:27.989
In Romans chapter 15, the Apostle Paul reported that he and his companions had thoroughly preached the good news.

01:26:27.989 --> 01:26:34.989
They had traveled as far as Elyricum, a Roman province that included part of what is today Albania.

01:26:34.989 --> 01:26:44.989
It is likely that some in the region became Christians at that time, for secular history reports that Christianity took root in Albania in the first century.

01:26:44.989 --> 01:26:50.989
In the 1920s, some Albanians learned Bible truth while living in the United States.

01:26:50.989 --> 01:26:58.989
After getting baptized, some returned to Albania, eager to share these precious truths with family and friends.

01:26:58.989 --> 01:27:08.989
In 1928, Lazar Nasson and Petro Stavro traveled from the United States back to Albania to show the photodrama of creation.

01:27:08.989 --> 01:27:19.989
Many responded, and despite political turmoil, economic reversal, and at times vigorous opposition, the number of kingdom proclaimers has grown steadily.

01:27:19.989 --> 01:27:27.989
Today, there are more than 5,400 publishers serving in 89 congregations.

01:27:27.989 --> 01:27:37.989
From Tirana, the capital, the branch office cares for the work in Albania, and the 228 publishers in its northeast neighbor, Kosovo.

01:27:38.989 --> 01:27:43.989
Let's visit the city of Lushnia, located in West Central Albania.

01:27:43.989 --> 01:27:54.989
The Lushnia-Vario congregation preaches in a territory that covers around one-third of the city, as well as 21 villages in the Musice valley.

01:27:54.989 --> 01:28:02.989
The preaching work in the villages yields good results, and meeting attendants regularly averages over 130%.

01:28:02.989 --> 01:28:06.989
They are happy to host a Romani language group.

01:28:06.989 --> 01:28:13.989
Though some publishers live in villages outside the city, they are happy to attend the meetings in person.

01:28:13.989 --> 01:28:17.989
Some walking one hour from their home to the kingdom hall.

01:28:17.989 --> 01:28:25.989
The 77 publishers of the Lushnia-Vario congregation send you their Christian affection and greetings.

01:28:25.989 --> 01:28:31.989
From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
