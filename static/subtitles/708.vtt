00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.990
The next part is a video entitled The Inside Story hosted by

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.390
Brother Ken Stovall, who also serves as a Theocratic School

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:42.710
instructor.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.810
I am so excited to be with you here again on this segment of

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.310
The Inside Story.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.310
This time we're with class number 143 of the Gilead School.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.509
And you are going to meet some adorable brothers and sisters.

00:00:56.509 --> 00:01:00.109
And let me tell you, they have some moving experiences to

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:01.310
relate to you.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.310
And we're going to solve two fascinating mysteries.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.709
And we have music.

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:09.510
Students in this class are going to thrill you with their

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.909
musical talent.

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.510
There is a captivating song that they're going to sing for

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:14.510
you.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:23.260
So come with me as we together get the Inside Story.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.060
Let's introduce our first guest.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:37.920
And that would be Sasha Komoromi from the Serbia branch.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.519
So Brother Komoromi, you serve at the Serbia branch.

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:46.319
But you told me that some years ago, before you were in

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:49.719
the truth, you discovered that there were two main interests

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:51.120
you had in life.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.920
One of them had to do with a career choice.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.120
Could you explain that?

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.120
One was music.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.319
Music.

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:02.319
Now, is this a picture of you?

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:05.420
That was the old name.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.719
Evidently you were in a band.

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:12.919
Yes, we were at one competition at that time.

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:14.919
That was one of your interests.

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:16.219
But there was another.

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:17.120
What was that?

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.919
Searching for purpose of life.

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:21.919
And how did you go about searching for life's purpose?

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:27.120
I read a lot of books, books about parapsychology,

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.919
Buddhism, spiritism, Tibetan Lamaism.

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:33.120
Amazing, that's a lot of books.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.020
Now, at the time, though, you were dating your wife, Vicky,

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.120
what did she think of all these books?

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.319
Did she share your interest in all this reading?

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.419
I wish she did, but no, she did not.

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:51.620
To be honest, it's not really easy to like, to read

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.620
that kind of books.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.520
For example, the book of the dead, the book of the dead,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.120
that I can see that's not going to be a very enjoyable book.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.020
Now, was it only books?

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.120
Is that the only way you were searching for the purpose of life?

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.620
No, I was also experimented with different states of mind

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.620
under influences of drugs during my hallucinations.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.819
I had many things already solved out.

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.819
You had everything solved.

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.319
This is what I thought.

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:31.020
But after I come to myself again

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.020
and I'm again in the same room and everything is the same.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.520
So I was really, really disappointed.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.719
And then I prayed to God.

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:43.719
I said, God, I'm asking just for one thing.

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:47.319
Whatever it is, just please help me to be certain

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:48.919
that I find the truth.

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:49.719
Very interesting.

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:52.620
So you prayed for Jehovah to help you find the truth.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.719
Of course, you didn't know Jehovah at the time.

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:58.919
So how was your prayer answered?

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.620
As soon after that, I went to Germany.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.919
I had the idea to form my music studio.

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:09.020
During my visit there, I understood that my uncle

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.520
and my aunt, David Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.819
And you never knew that before?

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.219
No, no, I didn't know.

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:17.220
So what did they have in their home

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.620
that would have been really exciting to you?

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.720
As all Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.620
they had a lot of telecratic books.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.720
So did you read the books?

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.120
Yes, I read them a lot.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.120
Actually, I read the book daily.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.819
Wow.

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:38.519
So you get back home, you open up the suitcases

00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:42.519
and Vicki's there and she sees books.

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:45.319
And you were supposed to bring home musical equipment.

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:47.519
What did she think about that?

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:53.699
She thought, now definitely she's totally crazy.

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:55.899
So what did you do?

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:59.300
I explained very immediately that from now on

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.899
I would like to leave according to what they read

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:04.000
in these books and the Bible.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.800
And I also would like for her that she also

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.600
leave like that.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.600
If this is okay with her, we can say together

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.100
if it is not okay with her, we are finished.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.199
You like to be direct, don't you?

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:22.199
I know, I was very tactful.

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:26.100
But I also offered her a book, Young People Ask.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.100
Did she like that?

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:30.500
Yes, she liked that much more than my ultimate.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.500
I see.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.500
We start studying the Bible.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.100
At the beginning my wife, she started because of me.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.500
But later she done this because of her.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.199
And after six months, we became unbaptized publishers.

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:50.699
Then we get married and we were baptized at 1994.

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:53.600
Immediately we start with full-time service

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.199
and we served five years as regular pioneers.

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:00.600
Then almost five years as special pioneers

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.300
and now we are 13 years in the Serbia branch.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.199
Jehovah has answered your prayer, you're satisfied.

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:10.100
You found the truth.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.899
You found the purpose in life.

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:16.000
But there's still the music.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.899
Did you have to give up your desire to play music,

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:23.100
to be involved in music, especially since you've come to Bethel now?

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.000
Actually, in 2013 there was one idea

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.300
that we should start with project recording vocal rendition

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.199
of our teocratic songs.

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:37.899
And my wife Violeta and I had privileged to participate

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:38.899
in that project.

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:41.199
Now, was this just for the Serbia branch?

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:41.899
No.

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:42.600
No.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.899
Plan was to record the songs in four or five languages.

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:48.800
Four or five languages.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.899
Would this mean that you would travel around

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.500
into the different countries surrounding Serbia?

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:54.500
No.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.500
Ideas was that singers will come from other countries to Serbia

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.500
and they will be full-time singers

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.399
for a period of time until we finish that project.

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:07.899
That must have been a tremendous amount of work.

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:10.100
How did you get that accomplished?

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.000
Yeah, it's easier if we see one video

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.199
and it will be much more understandable.

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:15.699
All right.

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:16.199
Good.

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:19.399
Let's watch the video.

00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:24.899
One of the first things we needed was a recording studio.

00:07:24.899 --> 00:07:34.259
So with the help of many, we built our own.

00:07:34.259 --> 00:07:41.069
A typical day began with a little music theory,

00:07:41.069 --> 00:07:43.069
a little stretching,

00:07:43.069 --> 00:07:49.040
and a brief review of the song's scriptural theme.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.540
Once they received a new song,

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:55.439
they practiced in separate groups.

00:07:55.439 --> 00:08:00.519
Then they would all come together.

00:08:00.519 --> 00:08:04.720
Finally, it was time to record.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.220
This resulted in 450 songs being recorded

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:21.649
in a period of 22 months.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:31.509
Looking back,

00:08:31.509 --> 00:08:34.909
these songs were sung not just with words,

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:44.350
but with hearts full of love for Jehovah.

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:49.750
Look at them.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.750
They were nice readings at the end.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:52.549
My surprise.

00:08:52.549 --> 00:08:54.149
I loved the way the chorus sounded.

00:08:54.149 --> 00:08:55.250
You did a good job with them.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:59.049
That must have been a tremendous amount of work.

00:08:59.049 --> 00:09:00.149
Getting that all done though,

00:09:00.149 --> 00:09:01.649
in five different languages.

00:09:01.649 --> 00:09:04.149
Yes, singers, they done a great job

00:09:04.149 --> 00:09:06.049
and also old crew.

00:09:06.049 --> 00:09:08.750
And we really could see all the times

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.149
they are in love for Jehovah,

00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:11.750
love for brotherhood.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.350
And every day,

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:16.450
we can see a lot of self-sacrificing spirit.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:18.250
Now, Sasha, let me ask you one more question.

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:21.049
We saw the picture there of you as a musician.

00:09:21.049 --> 00:09:23.950
And I know you have some musical talent.

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.149
Possibly you could have become famous.

00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:29.450
Do you ever regret not pursuing some sort of a career

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:32.649
in the world as opposed to giving your life

00:09:32.649 --> 00:09:33.450
in full-time service?

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:34.450
Did you, Jehovah?

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:35.649
As you said,

00:09:35.649 --> 00:09:40.250
I could be famous or I could become a drug addict

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.049
and now dead.

00:09:42.049 --> 00:09:43.750
That's a good voice.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.850
But no, no regrets at all.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:52.450
I received much, much more that I ever imagined.

00:09:52.549 --> 00:09:55.450
And in my case, from my first prayer,

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:57.149
till now, Jehovah ensured me

00:09:57.149 --> 00:10:00.049
that he's really here of prayers,

00:10:00.049 --> 00:10:04.149
as Solomon mentioned in Psalm 65 verse two.

00:10:04.149 --> 00:10:05.850
Excellent, thank you so much, Sasha,

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:08.850
for sharing these very heartfelt comments.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:17.649
And thank you.

00:10:17.649 --> 00:10:19.350
Now, you know what we're going to do?

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:21.549
We're going to give you opportunity

00:10:21.549 --> 00:10:24.850
to get to know some of the students in our audience.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:27.049
We're going to do an activity I call

00:10:27.049 --> 00:10:28.850
what's my favorite scripture?

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:30.450
So we're going to ask the students

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.049
if they'll volunteer and give us their favorite scripture.

00:10:33.049 --> 00:10:34.049
And in a minute or less,

00:10:34.049 --> 00:10:38.049
tell us what it says and why it's their favorite scripture.

00:10:38.049 --> 00:10:39.350
Okay.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:42.860
Let's see now.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.360
Who would like to go first?

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:49.460
Shingurai Mapfumo from Zimbabwe.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.460
Psalm 84 verse 11.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.960
And what does that say?

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.659
For Jehovah God is a sun and a shield.

00:10:57.659 --> 00:10:59.960
He gives favor and glory.

00:11:00.059 --> 00:11:02.960
Jehovah will not hold back anything good

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.860
from those walking in integrity.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:05.759
Okay, so tell us.

00:11:05.759 --> 00:11:07.659
Why is that your favorite scripture?

00:11:07.659 --> 00:11:11.360
During the economic crisis in Zimbabwe,

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.159
my partner, Patna and I ran out of food.

00:11:14.159 --> 00:11:16.460
We were really starving.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.159
And physically, we were so weak

00:11:18.159 --> 00:11:20.159
that we could not even function.

00:11:20.159 --> 00:11:21.759
Still, we managed to go to town

00:11:21.759 --> 00:11:24.759
hoping that we could get some money from the bank.

00:11:24.759 --> 00:11:26.659
There was a long queue.

00:11:26.659 --> 00:11:29.460
And the bank was not giving any money either.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.559
We were so distraught.

00:11:31.559 --> 00:11:35.159
At that moment, when we didn't know what to do,

00:11:35.159 --> 00:11:37.259
a truck from the branch office

00:11:37.259 --> 00:11:40.259
brought food supplies for us,

00:11:40.259 --> 00:11:42.259
then it became so clear to me

00:11:42.259 --> 00:11:44.759
that Jehovah is a shield

00:11:44.759 --> 00:11:46.860
and he never holds back anything good

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.659
from his loyal servants.

00:11:48.659 --> 00:11:49.559
Amazing.

00:11:49.559 --> 00:11:51.360
Well, I can see why that's your favorite scripture.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.059
All right, who else?

00:11:53.059 --> 00:11:54.860
Let's get sister.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.460
It's a Peng Mushongo.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.960
And she's from South Africa.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.360
My favorite scripture is Psalm 68 verse 5.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.860
And it says about Jehovah.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.759
He is the father of the fatherless

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:08.759
and a protector of leaders.

00:12:08.759 --> 00:12:10.860
Why is that your favorite scripture?

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:12.059
Well, I became motherless

00:12:12.059 --> 00:12:14.559
when I was only one year old.

00:12:14.559 --> 00:12:16.860
But Jehovah has provided me

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.759
with hundreds of mothers around the globe,

00:12:19.759 --> 00:12:22.460
both black and white.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:25.059
And because a battle work

00:12:25.059 --> 00:12:28.460
involves traveling all around the African continent,

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.559
working with the translators,

00:12:30.559 --> 00:12:32.860
it makes it even more precious to me

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:36.259
that I adopt this family wherever we go.

00:12:36.259 --> 00:12:39.360
Truly, Jehovah has proved to be my father

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.360
and my protector to this day.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.159
Very touching.

00:12:43.159 --> 00:12:45.360
And I'm sure that all of those parents

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.460
that have adopted you are proud to have you as a daughter.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.759
Who else could tell us their favorite scripture?

00:12:51.759 --> 00:12:55.759
All right, let's get brother Sylvain Bois from Benin.

00:12:55.759 --> 00:12:59.460
It is Psalm 94 verse 18 and 19.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:00.960
And what does it say?

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.559
Your loyal love,

00:13:02.559 --> 00:13:05.960
O Jehovah, kept supporting me.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.559
When anxieties overwhelm me,

00:13:08.559 --> 00:13:11.559
you comforted and soothed me.

00:13:11.559 --> 00:13:12.559
So tell us,

00:13:12.559 --> 00:13:15.360
why is that scripture special to you?

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.360
Years ago,

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.059
when I was attending Minnesota training school,

00:13:19.059 --> 00:13:20.960
I had a serious stroke

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.159
and I was hospitalized.

00:13:23.159 --> 00:13:25.659
When I woke from coma,

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.559
I felt very happy because I was alive

00:13:28.559 --> 00:13:30.759
but also very discouraged.

00:13:30.759 --> 00:13:33.860
Because I thought everything was over for me.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.159
Pioneer service, school,

00:13:36.159 --> 00:13:40.559
and even my dream to become one day a missionary.

00:13:40.559 --> 00:13:43.159
But one of the instructor and his wife

00:13:43.159 --> 00:13:44.759
came to the hospital

00:13:44.759 --> 00:13:46.960
and they read me that verse.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.159
And my heart was full of anxieties

00:13:50.159 --> 00:13:51.960
but that really felt that day

00:13:52.059 --> 00:13:56.360
that Jehovah was able to comfort me and soothed me.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.360
And you know what,

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.860
one year later,

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.159
I was permitted to attend again, MTS.

00:14:02.159 --> 00:14:03.960
And few months later,

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.460
Jehovah fulfilled another of my dream

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:09.259
as I've been assigned as a missionary in Africa.

00:14:09.259 --> 00:14:10.059
Brother Bois,

00:14:10.059 --> 00:14:11.059
that was very touching.

00:14:11.059 --> 00:14:11.960
Thank you so much.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.659
And we're so glad to have you in this class of Gileon.

00:14:14.659 --> 00:14:20.820
Well, that's all we're going to have time for.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:24.220
So now it's time to introduce our next guest.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.519
And that would be Brother Paulo Magaña

00:14:26.519 --> 00:14:37.620
and he's from Brazil.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.019
Now, Brother Magaña, you're at the Brazil branch

00:14:40.019 --> 00:14:43.320
but you came in the truth at nine years old

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.419
at the same time as your mother.

00:14:45.419 --> 00:14:47.120
And you went to the branch,

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.820
then to Bethel in your early 20s.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:53.019
And you've been there for 27 years.

00:14:53.019 --> 00:14:55.620
What department do you work in at the branch now?

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:58.519
I am now in LDC for one and a half years.

00:14:58.519 --> 00:14:59.720
LDC.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.519
Okay, would you just tell us

00:15:01.519 --> 00:15:03.820
what does the LDC department do?

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:07.120
LDC is the local and design construction department.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.419
It's responsible for the work of planning,

00:15:09.419 --> 00:15:11.519
construction, and maintenance of Kingdom Halls

00:15:11.519 --> 00:15:13.320
and assembly halls.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:17.320
You have the LDC department there in Bethel.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.620
But who outside of Bethel works with

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:23.820
building Kingdom Halls assembly halls?

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.220
Outside, we have many brothers and sisters

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.120
serving as construction servants,

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.820
construction volunteers,

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:33.120
remote volunteers, and field representatives.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.320
Now, this is the mystery.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.419
This is our first mystery.

00:15:35.419 --> 00:15:39.120
What really then does a field representative do?

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.720
Okay, let's call them just field reps, okay?

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:42.720
Okay, field reps.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.419
I like that.

00:15:43.419 --> 00:15:45.620
You used to say that they are the eyes

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.419
and the ears of the LDC at the branch.

00:15:48.419 --> 00:15:50.419
But what if I show you some pictures?

00:15:50.419 --> 00:15:51.419
I got the work.

00:15:51.419 --> 00:15:52.419
I would love that.

00:15:52.419 --> 00:15:53.820
Okay, at the first step,

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.220
the officer asks his hand to investigate

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.120
some congregation needs.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.019
He meets with the local elders,

00:16:00.019 --> 00:16:03.519
the secret overseer, to determine the needs.

00:16:03.519 --> 00:16:06.419
And later, he sends a recommendation to the officer.

00:16:06.419 --> 00:16:09.019
I see, so if he has a large region,

00:16:09.019 --> 00:16:11.120
he may have to have many, many of these meetings

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.519
and do a lot of research to determine

00:16:13.519 --> 00:16:15.519
what the needs are for Kingdom Halls.

00:16:15.519 --> 00:16:17.320
Once the project is approved,

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:20.320
the next step is to search for appropriate land,

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.419
a property.

00:16:21.419 --> 00:16:23.720
To do that, he goes to the internet,

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.720
consults real estate agents,

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:29.019
local brothers, neighbors, find a right property

00:16:29.019 --> 00:16:29.820
at the right cost,

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.519
can be very time consuming,

00:16:31.519 --> 00:16:35.220
and requires for him a lot of his cues and abilities.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:37.019
In the field reps is also responsible

00:16:37.019 --> 00:16:39.019
for getting the permits,

00:16:39.019 --> 00:16:40.820
the approvals for construction.

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:44.620
And he visits several different agencies every day

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:46.120
to get the permits,

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.120
to have everything approved by the government.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.120
In big cities, he may have to stand in line,

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.519
after line, after line,

00:16:51.519 --> 00:16:52.519
this could take.

00:16:52.519 --> 00:16:53.519
And in big cities,

00:16:53.519 --> 00:16:55.620
it can take even some weeks,

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:58.019
some months, to get everything approved.

00:16:58.019 --> 00:17:00.419
Finally, when everything is approved,

00:17:00.419 --> 00:17:02.320
the construction group starts the work.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.720
And you can see him again visiting to the site

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.019
in order to give some technical support

00:17:07.019 --> 00:17:08.519
for the construction over here.

00:17:08.519 --> 00:17:10.420
So now does he stay on the site

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.119
when a building is being built?

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:14.720
No, he turns to his office,

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.019
but remains in contact with the group

00:17:17.019 --> 00:17:19.119
to give some remote support.

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:22.920
Especially when some big issues arise at the site,

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.220
the construction over here

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:26.519
always can count on his good support.

00:17:26.519 --> 00:17:27.720
Okay, good.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.920
I noticed in this picture,

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.319
behind the field representative,

00:17:30.319 --> 00:17:32.119
we see a sister picture there.

00:17:32.119 --> 00:17:33.519
Who might that be?

00:17:33.519 --> 00:17:35.720
Well, if he's married,

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:39.319
his wife can do lots to work to help him.

00:17:39.319 --> 00:17:40.319
But he's not.

00:17:40.319 --> 00:17:43.619
He can count with a local volunteer to help him.

00:17:43.619 --> 00:17:45.119
Once the project is concluded,

00:17:45.119 --> 00:17:46.720
he visits the site again,

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.220
now to do the commissioning

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:50.519
and to make sure that everything was done

00:17:50.519 --> 00:17:51.619
according to the plans.

00:17:51.619 --> 00:17:53.819
So evidently, his job is done now.

00:17:53.819 --> 00:17:55.619
No, not yet.

00:17:55.619 --> 00:17:57.920
He's also responsible for giving training

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.019
for local brothers to properly maintain the building.

00:18:01.019 --> 00:18:01.619
Wow.

00:18:01.619 --> 00:18:04.119
So you have helped solve this mystery.

00:18:04.119 --> 00:18:06.519
He does have a lot of work to do.

00:18:06.519 --> 00:18:09.819
But does really working on one project

00:18:09.819 --> 00:18:10.920
keep him busy?

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.519
No, it is not just Wembers to vote.

00:18:13.519 --> 00:18:16.319
They are very busy and productive workers.

00:18:16.319 --> 00:18:17.819
In average, each field rep

00:18:17.819 --> 00:18:20.819
can work on 10 to 15 projects

00:18:20.819 --> 00:18:21.819
in different phases,

00:18:21.819 --> 00:18:23.019
but at the same time.

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:24.819
My goodness, that's amazing.

00:18:24.819 --> 00:18:28.519
They really do an amazing amount of work.

00:18:28.519 --> 00:18:30.920
Paulo, I understand that at your branch,

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:35.019
you've come up with a very innovative idea

00:18:35.019 --> 00:18:37.819
regarding assembly halls and kingdom halls.

00:18:37.819 --> 00:18:39.220
Could you explain that to us?

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.619
Yes, we'll have it done.

00:18:40.619 --> 00:18:43.119
It's called an expandable kingdom hall.

00:18:43.119 --> 00:18:46.319
Expandable kingdom hall.

00:18:46.319 --> 00:18:50.220
Sasha, do you have expandable kingdom halls in Serbia?

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.319
No, the time will go.

00:18:52.319 --> 00:18:55.619
I can't even imagine how do you expand the kingdom hall.

00:18:55.619 --> 00:18:58.720
Okay, what if we see a brief video about this?

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.220
Okay, I'd like that.

00:19:03.519 --> 00:19:07.119
At first, it looks like a normal kingdom hall.

00:19:07.119 --> 00:19:09.420
But something wonderful happens

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:12.319
when the back walls are lifted.

00:19:12.319 --> 00:19:16.119
It's now large enough to hold an entire assembly

00:19:16.119 --> 00:19:19.329
or convention.

00:19:19.329 --> 00:19:21.230
But before we can meet there,

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:24.029
it has to be cleaned.

00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:27.329
Chairs are rented and arranged.

00:19:27.329 --> 00:19:30.630
And all during video equipment must be set up

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:33.130
so that no matter where you sit,

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:36.329
you won't miss anything.

00:19:36.329 --> 00:19:38.529
All the hard work is worth it

00:19:38.529 --> 00:19:59.289
when you see how much the friends benefit.

00:19:59.289 --> 00:20:02.089
When the special weekend of activities over

00:20:02.089 --> 00:20:04.289
and the walls are lowered,

00:20:04.289 --> 00:20:08.289
it goes right back to being a kingdom hall again.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:28.279
That's our family there.

00:20:28.279 --> 00:20:31.180
Yeah, they sent you some spirited greetings.

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:34.980
And what a brilliant way to get the most out of a building

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:36.480
and save money.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.579
Now, Brother Magania, I just want to ask you,

00:20:38.579 --> 00:20:40.180
what has impressed you the most

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.880
about working with the LDC department?

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.680
What really touched my heart

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.180
is to see the spirit of willingness to help

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:50.380
show it by all those involved with the LDC.

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:51.980
You know, these brothers and sisters

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:55.279
have left their families, their halls, their friends behind

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.680
to work with these projects.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.680
All these sacrifices are done out of love.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.980
Love for our brotherhood

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:03.579
and especially love for Jehovah.

00:21:03.579 --> 00:21:05.680
That's the reason what I really,

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.980
I really appreciate their work.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:09.480
Thank you, Brother Magania.

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.380
Obviously, those brothers and sisters

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:14.279
that work with LDC set a good example for the rest of us.

00:21:14.279 --> 00:21:15.779
Thank you very much.

00:21:15.779 --> 00:21:21.920
My pleasure.

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.119
Now, Brother Tomoromi,

00:21:23.119 --> 00:21:25.019
it's time for you to give us a sample

00:21:25.019 --> 00:21:26.319
of your musical talent.

00:21:26.319 --> 00:21:33.339
Would you go and join our band?

00:21:33.339 --> 00:21:36.039
Recently, the governing body has given us

00:21:36.039 --> 00:21:37.440
loving encouragement

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.740
through our regional convention program

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:41.740
to never give up.

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:43.140
Now, the Gilead students

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:44.640
have written a song

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:48.940
that goes right along with that spirit and that theme.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:50.539
It's entitled,

00:21:50.539 --> 00:21:52.839
We'll Never Let Go.

00:21:52.839 --> 00:24:46.460
I thought that was a thrilling song.

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:47.460
You brothers and sisters

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.460
did a marvelous job on that.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.460
And you know what I liked about the song too?

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:53.559
It's that it gets progressively more modern

00:24:53.559 --> 00:24:55.859
as it goes through the song.

00:24:55.859 --> 00:24:58.960
So it really says to me that our organization

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.960
in its modern day history,

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.960
even in early times has never given up

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.960
and we will never give up.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:06.960
And it's so joyful.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:10.460
It says that we're going to endure with joy.

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.359
No one can take that away from us.

00:25:12.359 --> 00:25:15.460
It's Jehovah's gift through his Holy Spirit.

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:18.559
Now, it's time to introduce our final guest

00:25:18.559 --> 00:25:32.619
and that is Sister Angela Kang from the United States.

00:25:32.619 --> 00:25:35.720
Angela, you are one of the single sisters in our class,

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:39.119
but where in the United States do you serve?

00:25:39.119 --> 00:25:40.720
I met the remote translation office

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.319
in Sacramento, California

00:25:42.319 --> 00:25:44.819
and they translate into the Hmong language there.

00:25:44.819 --> 00:25:48.119
Now, I have to confess the Hmong language.

00:25:48.119 --> 00:25:50.720
I never knew until very recently

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.920
that there was such a language as the Hmong language.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:57.420
And I didn't realize there was a Hmong people.

00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:58.420
Why is that?

00:25:58.420 --> 00:25:59.319
Well, for a long time,

00:25:59.319 --> 00:26:02.019
the Hmong story was kept a secret from the American public.

00:26:02.019 --> 00:26:05.220
Now, this is another one of our mysteries

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:07.720
because why would it be

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.519
that someone would try to keep the existence

00:26:10.519 --> 00:26:12.819
of a whole culture secret?

00:26:12.819 --> 00:26:14.319
Well, during the Vietnam War,

00:26:14.319 --> 00:26:16.420
it was a very unpopular conflict.

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:17.920
And so the many US citizens,

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.819
they didn't want the war to expand.

00:26:19.819 --> 00:26:22.819
So the US government actually went to Southeast Asia

00:26:22.819 --> 00:26:24.819
and they secretly recruited the Hmong men

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.019
who were living in the hill trebs of loss

00:26:27.019 --> 00:26:29.220
to fight communism in that part of the world.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:32.519
In the end, about 40,000 Hmong men were killed and not worked.

00:26:32.519 --> 00:26:34.819
And so that's about one in four Hmong men.

00:26:34.819 --> 00:26:36.720
So every family lost someone.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.819
40,000 men.

00:26:38.819 --> 00:26:42.119
I don't think that people really are aware of that fact.

00:26:42.119 --> 00:26:42.920
Are they?

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.019
No, I'm many historians.

00:26:44.019 --> 00:26:46.119
They call that conflict the secret war.

00:26:46.119 --> 00:26:47.220
Looking at our monitor here,

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:49.319
what is it we're seeing here?

00:26:49.319 --> 00:26:52.220
This was an exhibit showcasing the Hmong experience,

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:53.720
how they came to the US.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:57.019
And it's a wall of unknown soldiers who fought in the war.

00:26:57.019 --> 00:26:58.420
And they were asking the Hmong community

00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.920
to identify their loved ones.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:02.920
So if you and our congregation knew some of those men.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:03.920
I see.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.519
Now, as I think back to the history of that war,

00:27:06.519 --> 00:27:07.619
at some point in time,

00:27:07.619 --> 00:27:10.220
the United States pulled out a Vietnam.

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:13.220
So what happened then to the Hmong

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:14.920
that were left there in Vietnam

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.420
when the US pulled out?

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:18.019
It was a desperate situation

00:27:18.019 --> 00:27:20.720
because there was an aggressive campaign

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.619
to capture and kill any of the remaining Hmong families.

00:27:23.619 --> 00:27:26.519
And so many of them had to find a way to escape.

00:27:26.519 --> 00:27:29.420
And so we see that here in this photo.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:32.720
This is Long Chiang Air Base in 1975.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.119
About 30,000 Hmong people

00:27:34.119 --> 00:27:36.720
converge on that airport hoping to find a way out.

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:39.019
But only about 2,500 were airlifted.

00:27:39.019 --> 00:27:40.220
The more prominent officials.

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:40.920
I see.

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.920
You can see that those thousands of people there

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.619
are not going to fit on that airplane.

00:27:44.619 --> 00:27:48.220
So all these thousands that were left behind,

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:50.019
what happened to them?

00:27:50.019 --> 00:27:51.519
They were pretty much left on their own.

00:27:51.519 --> 00:27:53.220
And they had to find their way out,

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:55.019
along with thousands of other families.

00:27:55.019 --> 00:27:57.019
And so that's what happened to my family.

00:27:57.019 --> 00:27:59.019
They found their way across the Meacon River

00:27:59.019 --> 00:28:01.619
into Thailand and they were placed in refugee camps.

00:28:01.619 --> 00:28:02.119
I see.

00:28:02.119 --> 00:28:05.220
So who are we seeing a picture of here now on the monitor?

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:08.119
This is my father in the Thailand refugee camp

00:28:08.119 --> 00:28:11.220
and my mother, my grandmother, and my uncle.

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:14.220
Now, so your family managed to survive

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:19.019
by fleeing into Thailand and getting into the refugee camp.

00:28:19.019 --> 00:28:22.119
But then how did they get to the United States?

00:28:22.119 --> 00:28:25.519
In 1979, they were sponsored to the United States.

00:28:25.519 --> 00:28:27.819
And the culture is patriarchal.

00:28:27.819 --> 00:28:29.319
So you stick close with your clan.

00:28:29.319 --> 00:28:31.920
And so my entire clan ended up in California

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.019
and they settled in South Sacramento.

00:28:34.019 --> 00:28:36.019
I can imagine that this experience

00:28:36.019 --> 00:28:39.220
must have been a tremendous amount of loss

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:42.019
for among people, among families.

00:28:42.019 --> 00:28:43.819
My father, he lost his mother.

00:28:43.819 --> 00:28:46.019
When they were fleeing, he lost his brother.

00:28:46.019 --> 00:28:48.019
He saw many people lose their lives.

00:28:48.019 --> 00:28:49.319
Many clans were separated.

00:28:49.319 --> 00:28:51.519
Some of their relatives ended up in France

00:28:51.519 --> 00:28:54.019
and the rest of them ended up in the United States.

00:28:54.019 --> 00:28:56.019
And then when they settled here,

00:28:56.019 --> 00:28:57.619
my mom, she lost her hearing.

00:28:57.619 --> 00:28:59.619
So it was just an added stress in their lives.

00:28:59.619 --> 00:29:02.220
So how did all this suffering and loss,

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.619
how did it affect your mother?

00:29:03.619 --> 00:29:05.619
Even though her background is animous,

00:29:05.619 --> 00:29:07.420
she knew that the Bible was a holy book

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:09.220
that would teach her about the creator.

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:11.619
So she found comfort in reading the Bible.

00:29:11.619 --> 00:29:13.819
And she started to collect different Bibles

00:29:13.819 --> 00:29:15.019
from different translations

00:29:15.019 --> 00:29:16.819
and comparing them to try to understand

00:29:16.819 --> 00:29:18.119
what she was reading.

00:29:18.119 --> 00:29:20.920
And every night, she would pray with me and my sister.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.319
And so from a young age,

00:29:22.319 --> 00:29:24.319
we were taught that God is real,

00:29:24.319 --> 00:29:26.420
even though we didn't know Jehovah yet.

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:29.019
Wow, very, very interesting.

00:29:29.019 --> 00:29:32.019
So she was really, really looking for the truth.

00:29:32.019 --> 00:29:35.119
So how did she eventually find the truth?

00:29:35.119 --> 00:29:36.920
Well, in the meantime, my uncle,

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:38.019
the one who was pictured earlier,

00:29:38.019 --> 00:29:40.019
he and his wife started studying the Bible

00:29:40.019 --> 00:29:41.519
and they came into the truth.

00:29:41.519 --> 00:29:44.119
And they asked his sister to come study with my mom

00:29:44.119 --> 00:29:46.319
and soon my entire family was studying.

00:29:46.319 --> 00:29:48.319
In 1996, my mom was baptized

00:29:48.319 --> 00:29:51.319
in 1997, me and my sister were baptized.

00:29:51.319 --> 00:29:55.819
Amazing. So now you were baptized at the age of 12.

00:29:55.819 --> 00:29:58.819
And then you started pioneering at the age of 15.

00:29:58.819 --> 00:29:59.619
Yes.

00:29:59.619 --> 00:30:01.920
Now, first of all, you were in an English congregation.

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.920
But what changed that?

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.619
Our secret overseer, he came through

00:30:05.619 --> 00:30:08.019
and he was telling us about a Hmong group

00:30:08.019 --> 00:30:10.220
that had formed in our sister congregation.

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:13.019
And he told us we had no reason to be in English.

00:30:13.019 --> 00:30:14.420
And he was right.

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:17.220
So as a family, we moved over to the Hmong group.

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:20.920
And in 1999, that group became the very first Hmong congregation.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.319
So that made us very happy.

00:30:22.319 --> 00:30:26.019
So you were associated with the very first Hmong congregation

00:30:26.019 --> 00:30:27.519
anywhere in the world.

00:30:27.519 --> 00:30:29.220
Amazing.

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:30.920
Now later, you toured Bethel.

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.019
And that had a profound effect on you.

00:30:33.019 --> 00:30:34.720
Can you tell us about that?

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:35.720
Well, we came to Bethel

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:38.119
and a brother in Transition Services.

00:30:38.119 --> 00:30:39.119
He found out we were coming through

00:30:39.119 --> 00:30:41.220
so he wanted to meet with us.

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:43.220
And he sat us girls down and he told us,

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:46.019
you have something you can give to Jehovah.

00:30:46.019 --> 00:30:47.420
And that's your language.

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:50.819
So it really got me thinking about what I could do

00:30:50.819 --> 00:30:52.220
to really support the field.

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:55.319
So I went home and I really worked on my language

00:30:55.319 --> 00:30:57.220
and worked on supporting the group.

00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:01.319
And in 2007, when Bethel came looking for translators,

00:31:01.319 --> 00:31:04.319
this same brother came out and he interviewed a group of us.

00:31:04.319 --> 00:31:07.119
And shortly after that, me, my mom and another brother

00:31:07.119 --> 00:31:11.119
were invited to serve on the Hmong Transition team

00:31:11.119 --> 00:31:13.220
at the first RTO here in the US branch.

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:13.720
My goodness.

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:17.619
So the first Hmong congregation anywhere in the world

00:31:17.619 --> 00:31:21.720
and the first RTO for the US branch.

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:23.319
Jehovah certainly has blessed you

00:31:23.319 --> 00:31:25.819
with some wonderful privileges.

00:31:25.819 --> 00:31:29.420
Could you just tell us what's it like working at the RTO

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:30.619
from day to day?

00:31:30.619 --> 00:31:30.920
Sure.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:31.819
Would you like to see a video?

00:31:31.819 --> 00:31:37.039
Yes, we would.

00:31:37.039 --> 00:31:41.539
At the Hmong RTO, many hands help in the Transition War.

00:31:41.539 --> 00:31:45.240
When questions come up, we're not left on our own.

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.039
The Transition Services Department

00:31:47.039 --> 00:31:49.039
is always ready to provide support.

00:31:51.839 --> 00:31:56.339
Once everything is approved, it's time to record it.

00:31:56.339 --> 00:31:59.740
Since Hmong wasn't a written language into the 1950s,

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:03.839
audio publications are very important to the Hmong feel.

00:32:03.839 --> 00:32:07.140
Some support the RTO and other valuable ways too,

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:11.049
such as cooking and cleaning.

00:32:11.049 --> 00:32:14.150
It's the best feeling to talk to the Hmong people

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:16.950
and to show them something in their language.

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:21.250
You can see how it touches their heart.

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:24.150
As a result, we have many interested ones

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:28.779
attend our meetings.

00:32:28.779 --> 00:32:31.180
As the Hmong feel continues to grow,

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:32.680
many are learning our language

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:37.390
to help support the preaching work.

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:40.990
When we get together, we have a great time.

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:47.089
With good food, association, watching the kids play,

00:32:47.089 --> 00:32:49.890
it's obvious to everyone in the community

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:53.890
that we're not just a congregation, we're a family.

00:32:53.890 --> 00:33:08.599
That was a wonderful video, really.

00:33:08.599 --> 00:33:11.200
Angela, could you just tell us,

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:15.200
why does the work done at the RTO feel such a great need

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.799
among the Hmong people?

00:33:16.799 --> 00:33:19.099
Well, the Hmong are people without a country.

00:33:19.099 --> 00:33:21.400
And throughout history, they've been pushed from one location

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.400
to another.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:25.299
They were pushed out of China in the late 1800s.

00:33:25.299 --> 00:33:27.099
They were pushed out of Laos.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:30.000
And from there, they were scattered across the world

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.099
to the US, to France, to Australia.

00:33:33.099 --> 00:33:34.799
And to so many of the Hmong brothers,

00:33:34.799 --> 00:33:38.819
they feel like a forgotten people.

00:33:38.819 --> 00:33:43.319
What does this feel like to the first time I've heard of?

00:33:43.319 --> 00:33:48.319
It's the first time she's seen a video, so it's moving.

00:33:48.319 --> 00:33:49.819
So many of the Hmong brothers,

00:33:49.819 --> 00:33:52.119
they feel like a forgotten people.

00:33:52.119 --> 00:33:54.420
But the work at the RTO is a reminder

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:57.220
that Jehovah hasn't forgotten them.

00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:59.319
In fact, he invites them to become

00:33:59.319 --> 00:34:02.119
part of an international clan of Brotherhood.

00:34:02.119 --> 00:34:04.119
And when they respond to that invitation,

00:34:04.119 --> 00:34:07.420
they find something that they've been looking for all along.

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:09.820
They finally find a place, a permanent home,

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:11.219
under God's Kingdom.

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:13.320
Thank you for those heartfelt comments.

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.619
Really, those are very nice.

00:34:15.619 --> 00:34:19.320
Now, Sister Kang, we have a little surprise for you.

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:22.920
We really want the audience to know that

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:25.320
with the work done at the Hmong RTO

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:27.920
is not just for the United States,

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:31.219
but the effect reaches clear around the world.

00:34:31.219 --> 00:34:33.920
In fact, we have caught up with the congregation

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:35.719
in Northern Thailand.

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:37.420
And I know this is a surprise.

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:38.719
We did not rehearse this.

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:40.719
No, it's not.

00:34:40.719 --> 00:34:43.719
But we're going to show you if you'd like.

00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:44.619
Yeah.

00:34:44.619 --> 00:35:17.909
Watch this.

00:35:17.909 --> 00:35:20.210
Well, obviously, they're grateful for the work

00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:23.710
you brothers and sisters do in that RTO.

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:26.909
Wasn't this a thrilling occasion?

00:35:26.909 --> 00:35:29.710
It was wonderful, enjoyable, to get to know

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:31.309
these brothers and sisters.

00:35:31.309 --> 00:35:34.309
We wish that Jehovah continued to bless you

00:35:34.309 --> 00:35:36.510
in your faithful service to him

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:50.699
until the next time we get together on the Inside Story.

00:35:50.699 --> 00:35:52.199
Thank you very much, Brother Stovall,

00:35:52.199 --> 00:35:55.099
for sharing with us the Inside Story.

00:35:55.099 --> 00:35:59.300
We appreciate very much your letting us in on it.

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.199
But I have to admit, this is the first

00:36:01.199 --> 00:36:03.199
really a graduation I've ever been to,

00:36:03.199 --> 00:36:08.969
where I couldn't help but pat my foot back there.

00:36:08.969 --> 00:36:11.969
I'm just so glad I was behind the curtain.
