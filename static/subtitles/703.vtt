WEBVTT

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:13.679
So we welcome you to the graduation of the 141st Class of Gilead, and as a reminder,

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.300
it's requested that no flash cameras be used during the program.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:26.379
Any picture taken without flash must be taken from your seat location, no recordings

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:29.100
of any kind are permitted.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:36.179
Similar telephone's electronic tablets or similar devices should not be used to transmit

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:39.200
any part of the program.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:47.659
Program notes, whether heart copy or electronic, should not be distributed to others.

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:56.219
Now to begin our program, we'll open and sing song number 107, come to Jehovah's Mountain

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:01.399
and then Brother Troy Snyder, the member of the United States Branch Committee will offer

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:02.399
our opening prayer.

00:01:02.399 --> 00:03:52.800
So we invite you to stand at song 107.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.560
Special days finally arrive, and I know your family and close friends are pleased to

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.560
be here to share this special occasion.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:10.060
Of course, all the rest are enjoying the moment with you because it's a spiritual

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.060
program.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:17.259
Of course, now we broadcasted later in the whole Brotherhood, for the most part, able to

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:25.100
benefit from the special activity that for many years was only at Bethel itself.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:35.720
Now, your class enjoyed the spring here in Patterson and enjoyed the summer at Patterson

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:43.399
at beautiful surroundings, and Jehovah sure to bless his earthly part of his organization

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:46.800
to have such a place to be educated.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:54.399
However, now you'll be leaving for your assignments, and we're going to be entering in the fall

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:56.899
season.

00:04:56.899 --> 00:05:04.120
So most years, that can be spectacular in upstate New York.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.600
Of course, New England is renowned for the beauty of the leaves changing, these radiant

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.600
colors.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:17.399
It's just Jehovah just amazes us with what can happen each fall season.

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:22.480
And put me in mind, because we're soon to experience it, and hopefully it'll be a good

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.000
season this year.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.519
Of a picture I had in the past, and I appreciated it, but it's a beautiful picture on a lake

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:38.439
with trees surrounding the lake, very nice, and it was a fall scene.

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:43.639
And so all of these beautiful trees, the radiant colors around the water, it's just kind

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:50.600
of makes you think about the site there at Warwick and what's coming this fall.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:59.120
And the reason I bring it up is because the caption for the picture was change.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.079
The only thing permanent is change.

00:06:04.079 --> 00:06:05.879
Is that true?

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:08.279
I see some heads going like that.

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:14.959
No, not all the time, but we can understand why imperfect humans would come to that conclusion,

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:24.079
but Jehovah is permanently the true God, thankfully that will never change.

00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:31.279
And there's other things that don't change, take it to keepers that are already experiencing

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:36.759
Jehovah's favor, those holy angels, they didn't change.

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:42.560
But I bring it up because we've entered such a time where all these changes are going

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:51.600
on, and your class has been held during some historic changes.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.600
It minimized that.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.600
It's been quite phenomenal.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:01.680
Now when you think about the class you're in and the historic things that are going on,

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:10.209
yours is the last class to be held when headquarters was in Brooklyn.

00:07:10.209 --> 00:07:16.930
Now, had you thought about that last one?

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:22.050
Now many of us have already moved to Warwick, so the headquarters staff that will be living

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:25.730
there is just moving in on it.

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:30.889
We've been moving for months all these three different sites, and there's more moving

00:07:30.889 --> 00:07:32.529
to come.

00:07:32.529 --> 00:07:39.689
And we rejoice that it worked out as the construction project committee and the thousands that supported

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:46.329
them, brothers and sisters, things speed it up, and we got in there going in there a few

00:07:46.329 --> 00:07:48.009
months early.

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:50.290
So that's a rejoicing moment.

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:56.290
Tours, as was mentioned in the broadcast this September, don't begin until next year,

00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:00.889
but Jehovah was kind to you and brought you over this week to see some of Warwick, and

00:08:00.889 --> 00:08:06.610
I see your big smiles, you enjoyed that, even though there's things that you might want

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:12.810
to come back in the future to see when the tours really do begin to function.

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:17.810
So we know you're enjoying the experience here of being educated, but if you think

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:24.050
about it, what does this tell us about Jehovah with moving, and I've been telling folks

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:29.810
for some months, years back, we've made the statement that, and this was according to

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:36.370
some studies that were done, the death of a loved one divorce and moving, three top

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:40.009
stressors in life.

00:08:40.009 --> 00:08:45.929
And though there are moving can tell you, but it's right up there with death of a loved

00:08:45.929 --> 00:08:50.210
one and divorce, so that's stress.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:54.970
So you might wonder, well, why in the middle of all of this and these changes we knew were

00:08:54.970 --> 00:09:00.210
going to happen, we still had the class of Gilead.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:06.009
You still weren't going to, why did we not say, well, let's be reasonable and hold off

00:09:06.009 --> 00:09:11.289
and have one after this stressful period's over, because the US branch committee gives

00:09:11.289 --> 00:09:15.210
such beautiful support to headquarters as well.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:23.210
And it just shows you Jehovah directs this organization, period.

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:29.090
He's governing it, and he just loves you, because this is addressed.

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:33.250
These comments primarily to you, once you're educated.

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:40.090
And that's just this warm and grace for you that you're invited, and you did enjoy it.

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:46.330
You have all the deep study and all of that, but all of that was going on around you.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:50.929
I think you'd agreed, didn't affect how you were instructed and what was done.

00:09:50.929 --> 00:09:58.009
So it tells us that Jehovah, and you can see it, especially in recent years, so much emphasis

00:09:58.009 --> 00:10:00.009
on education.

00:10:00.009 --> 00:10:11.210
And I'm reminded of what a lie who said here and beautiful thought here in Job chapter 36,

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:14.330
Job chapter 36.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:24.889
And we're going to see where he makes this statement in verse 22, look, God is exalted

00:10:24.889 --> 00:10:30.250
in his power, and then notice what instructor is like him.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:35.450
Well, you're not supposed to try to come up with an answer.

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:39.809
That's a question that answers itself.

00:10:39.809 --> 00:10:42.330
What instructor is like him?

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.169
There is none.

00:10:44.169 --> 00:10:48.490
No instructor like to Jehovah God, no.

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:55.490
In fact, when you think about our Heavenly Father, the Grand Instructor, we're reminded

00:10:55.490 --> 00:11:03.850
of Romans here, chapter 11, so if you would please find Romans chapter 11.

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:13.610
And this reveals to us why the only one that never needed education or instruction is

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:16.409
our Heavenly Father, Jehovah God.

00:11:16.409 --> 00:11:20.409
And Jesus would tell you that as well.

00:11:20.409 --> 00:11:25.850
He was instructed by his father personally, first born of all creation.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:30.049
And when you think about the warm and grace in his love for your hair, because I know

00:11:30.049 --> 00:11:37.649
you're closer to Jehovah than when you first arrived, has to happen with this course,

00:11:37.649 --> 00:11:39.970
with the fine instructors we have.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:49.659
In Romans chapter 11, verse 33 and verse 34, oh, the depth of God's riches and wisdom

00:11:49.659 --> 00:11:51.740
and knowledge.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:59.019
How unsearchable his judgments are and beyond tracing out his ways are for who has come

00:11:59.019 --> 00:12:04.019
to know Jehovah's mind or who has become his advisor.

00:12:04.019 --> 00:12:07.179
So you have to think about that, let that sink in.

00:12:07.179 --> 00:12:10.539
The riches of his wisdom and knowledge.

00:12:10.539 --> 00:12:11.539
It's just unfathomable.

00:12:11.539 --> 00:12:16.059
You just have to let that sink in.

00:12:16.059 --> 00:12:19.740
The depth of God's riches, wisdom and knowledge.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:25.220
There's no way to search out his judgments, can't trace out his ways.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:29.019
That's why we adore and worship Jehovah God.

00:12:29.019 --> 00:12:35.299
And you can't know his mind, none of us can, until he reveals it.

00:12:35.299 --> 00:12:42.179
That's why sometimes you'll hear brothers and sisters sincerely, so I'm sure, kind

00:12:42.179 --> 00:12:53.340
of speculating and, okay, somebody thinks they know Jehovah's mind and beyond what he

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:58.620
gave his hair, okay, but we don't follow creatures.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:04.940
We followed Jehovah God because he's our grand instructor and you're a lot closer to

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:12.779
him, assuring yourself of being taught by him when you get into your assignment, as

00:13:12.779 --> 00:13:16.779
well as on into eternity.

00:13:16.779 --> 00:13:22.899
Now there's some fine thoughts prepared for you from brothers to follow.

00:13:22.899 --> 00:13:27.700
I thought I'd just give you a brief preview just to get you to focus and the rest and

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:32.700
attendance will be able to do that, but this is for your benefit.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:41.570
You're going to find out about a cloud, okay, that's all I'm telling you.

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:48.970
You're going to find out about an enemy and it's not Satan in this particular theme.

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:53.820
You're going to find out about testing Jehovah out.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:59.779
And then we always enjoy your experiences, so we look forward to that and I know the

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:06.100
pressures on you look forward to being finished and successfully so.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:11.700
And then nice interviews with some of you about how are you going to use your gift?

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:16.379
And then the principal talked about making good use of your time.

00:14:16.379 --> 00:14:23.580
So some nice thoughts and we look forward to the presentation by these brothers.

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:28.460
First we have Brother Ralph Walls, who's a helper to the Personnel Committee and the

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:49.210
member of the United States Branch Committee and Brother Walls has the theme C, the Cloud.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:53.889
First of all, I'd like to say on behalf of the United States Branch Committee, we really

00:14:53.889 --> 00:15:00.289
do rejoice with you and it's been a real pleasure to get to know some of you, hopefully most

00:15:00.289 --> 00:15:03.070
of you.

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:10.590
But your example of love and appreciation for Jehovah and the earthly part of his organization

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:13.269
is really motivating.

00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:19.509
One couple in this class experienced what was a very emotional time just after learning

00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:21.750
of their invitation.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:27.350
The sister's father fell ill and then he died.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:34.350
It was a real challenge for them but they accepted the invitation to come to Gilead.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:38.070
A brother was special pioneering in his branch territory and then he was invited to the

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:40.990
branch temporarily.

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:47.190
Another change came, he was reassigned as a special pioneer and then there were adjustments

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:51.750
for some of the special pioneers to regular pioneer and he thought, well I'll go back

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:54.509
to regular pioneering.

00:15:54.509 --> 00:16:00.470
He was invited to Gilead but his father died.

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:04.149
He came, he's here.

00:16:04.149 --> 00:16:07.110
We could go on with other examples.

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:10.590
Now what does this have to do with the Cloud?

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:18.190
Well let's see, please turn with me to Numbers chapter 9 and we'll read together beginning

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:33.700
in verse 17, Numbers 9, 17, whenever the Cloud lifted from the tent, the Israelites would

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:41.299
promptly depart and the place where the Cloud would remain there is where the Israelites

00:16:41.299 --> 00:16:43.299
wouldn't camp.

00:16:43.299 --> 00:16:49.779
At the order of Jehovah, the Israelites would depart and at the order of Jehovah, they

00:16:49.779 --> 00:16:51.940
would camp.

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:57.179
As long as the Cloud remained over the Tabernacle, they would remain in camp.

00:16:57.179 --> 00:17:02.299
When the Cloud would stay over the Tabernacle for many days, the Israelites would obey

00:17:02.299 --> 00:17:05.940
Jehovah and not depart.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:09.940
Sometimes the Cloud would remain for a few days over the Tabernacle.

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:16.460
At the order of Jehovah, they would remain in camp and at the order of Jehovah, they

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:18.900
would depart.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:24.180
Sometimes the Cloud would remain only from evening until morning and when the Cloud lifted

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:27.980
in the morning, they would depart.

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:35.619
Whether it was day or night, when the Cloud lifted, they would depart.

00:17:35.619 --> 00:17:40.579
Whether it was two days a month or longer, as long as the Cloud stayed over the Tabernacle,

00:17:40.579 --> 00:17:43.660
the Israelites remained in camp and would not depart.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:48.220
But when it lifted, they would depart.

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:58.059
At the order of Jehovah, they would camp and at the order of Jehovah, they would depart.

00:17:58.059 --> 00:18:09.059
They kept their obligation to Jehovah at the order of Jehovah through Moses, interesting.

00:18:09.059 --> 00:18:13.940
That phrase at the order of Jehovah appears seven times.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:18.740
You see, Jehovah was in total control.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:26.140
When that Cloud moved, the nation moved, and did you notice how they would do so promptly?

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:33.660
Now whether it was a few days a month or longer, if the commandment was to leave in the

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:39.339
middle of the night or during the morning or day, it made no difference.

00:18:39.339 --> 00:18:41.539
They would move.

00:18:41.539 --> 00:18:42.539
Why?

00:18:42.539 --> 00:18:44.420
They saw the Cloud.

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:49.579
Now, imagine a camp of about three million people.

00:18:49.579 --> 00:18:53.420
The watchmen have seen the fiery Cloud at night.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:19:00.619
It's lifted up from the Tabernacle and it's pointing to the North.

00:19:00.619 --> 00:19:07.819
Suddenly, after a year of camping in one spot, the shrill notes of a silver trumpet cleave

00:19:07.819 --> 00:19:14.819
the air and after a brief interval in which the camp waits to see if there would be fluctuating

00:19:14.819 --> 00:19:20.500
blasts which signal the breaking up of the camp, they move.

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:28.900
Now that means a whole camp of Israel changed its position promptly, three million people.

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:35.180
Mothers shaking their children out of sleep, daughters packing up belonging sons, rounding

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:43.420
up the family, livestock fathers, putting all of the items on the animals.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:49.500
And in a little time, the whole camp would be on the march to who knows where they certainly

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:54.539
didn't until they made their next encampment.

00:19:54.539 --> 00:20:02.180
They see the Cloud and they knew that it was Jehovah who's directing them.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:06.940
Now you folks are examples of those who see the Cloud.

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:13.700
You know that Jehovah, not the imperfect men that he's using, is in total control.

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:18.900
And we humans find it generally difficult for change, as you heard in our dear brother

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:27.259
Morse's comments, but Jehovah's people, from the days of Abraham down to our day, have

00:20:27.259 --> 00:20:32.339
seen that we've had to be humble, flexible and obedient.

00:20:32.339 --> 00:20:36.539
We must maintain spiritual vision.

00:20:36.539 --> 00:20:40.500
We have to see the Cloud.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:46.940
Psalm 78, 14, reminds us that it was Jehovah who used that Cloud.

00:20:47.819 --> 00:20:53.059
There was a 39-year-old sister, single sister serving at Bethel for eight years.

00:20:53.059 --> 00:20:57.299
And she made herself available for whoever she could best serve.

00:20:57.299 --> 00:21:02.500
While she was asked to attend SKE, the school for Kingdom Evangelizers, and she received

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:08.380
an assignment that was shocking to her, to a country where the work is restricted.

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.460
Single sister.

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:11.980
She said this,

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:18.220
I'm extremely grateful to Jehovah for this undeserved blessing and also for the trust and support

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.579
that I've been given.

00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:25.660
I'm married couple who served together at Bethel for 25 years.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:29.779
He served before that, totaling 32 years.

00:21:29.779 --> 00:21:34.539
They were recently assigned to special pioneers after all those years at Bethel.

00:21:34.539 --> 00:21:36.420
You know what they said?

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.180
I'll quote them.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.660
We have feelings, of course.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.539
Why would anyone want to leave Bethel?

00:21:43.539 --> 00:21:47.140
It's easy to forget that when we came to Bethel, we had a preference.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.900
But we agreed to be assigned anywhere.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:58.019
Lovingly, Jehovah watches how we display submission and loyalty to his organization.

00:21:58.019 --> 00:22:03.819
Now in the United States branch territory, there's an ongoing effort to better utilize

00:22:03.819 --> 00:22:05.660
Kingdom Halls.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:10.779
And this has resulted in many publishers being assigned to different congregations, more

00:22:10.779 --> 00:22:12.180
to come.

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:18.940
Now commenting on the general benefits, here's what one circuit overseer said.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:23.220
This lets the friends know how to rely on Jehovah.

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.819
This woke a lot of people up.

00:22:25.819 --> 00:22:30.660
Learn obedience, submissiveness, and how to follow direction.

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:35.019
The elders and ministerial servants did an excellent job of demonstrating this.

00:22:35.019 --> 00:22:43.660
The friends will even more learn to a greater degree as they assimilate into their new congregations.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:46.180
Interesting.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.900
Think about it.

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:53.779
During the wilderness trek, Jehovah might have moved the cloud in the middle of the night,

00:22:53.779 --> 00:22:58.500
and their locations may not have seemed logical from a human standpoint.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.579
Why would Jehovah do such a thing?

00:23:00.579 --> 00:23:02.059
We don't know.

00:23:02.059 --> 00:23:07.619
Maybe he could see the movement of enemy camps of Israel, whatever the case.

00:23:07.619 --> 00:23:13.180
It's vital that they would have responded promptly.

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:21.099
All of us today need to see the cloud as we get closer to the Great Tribulation.

00:23:21.099 --> 00:23:27.380
The time is now when we have to obey and not ask, why did they make that decision?

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:36.119
As one traveling overseer said, don't put a question mark where Jehovah puts a period.

00:23:36.119 --> 00:23:43.480
You, dear students, have already shown prompt response to direction that Jehovah's organization

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.960
has provided.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.000
Please do it more fully.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.119
And to the extent that you do, Jehovah will continue to bless you.

00:23:53.119 --> 00:23:56.920
Don't see the men that Jehovah's using.

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:59.440
See the cloud.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:12.859
And may all of us do the same.

00:24:12.859 --> 00:24:18.500
Thank you very much, Brother Walls, that was a very faith strengthening, and I already

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:19.500
have to ask for forgiveness.

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:29.019
I've got to mention my good friend's theme, but he forgave me in the back, in the preview.

00:24:29.019 --> 00:24:34.220
Intriguing theme from Brother Samuel heard of the member of the governing body.

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:42.039
Let the memories sustain you.

00:24:42.039 --> 00:24:52.000
Earlier when Brother Morse didn't introduce my talk, I started to go home.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:02.519
And then I remembered, he's imperfect.

00:25:02.519 --> 00:25:06.359
Thank God for the gifts of memory.

00:25:06.359 --> 00:25:11.480
If we couldn't recall the who, the what, the where of our everyday lives, our lives would

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:15.599
be unmanageable.

00:25:15.599 --> 00:25:17.960
We have a short-term memory.

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:24.279
We have a long-term, episodic memory, our semantic memory.

00:25:24.279 --> 00:25:30.160
Sometimes we look at our picture album on a rainy afternoon, and what we see ignites

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.960
memories.

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:39.119
The school is over, but your memory bank is very much alive.

00:25:39.119 --> 00:25:45.720
Now whether we like it or not, sometimes different memories of past events pop into our

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:51.079
heads for no apparent reason.

00:25:51.079 --> 00:25:54.960
Smells ring bells.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:26:03.240
A sister spoke to me when we were in an elevator, and she said, you make me think of my father.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:13.359
My dad, I thought it couldn't be my looks, and she's white and I'm black.

00:26:13.359 --> 00:26:18.079
It couldn't be my voice because I haven't said anything yet.

00:26:18.079 --> 00:26:25.920
I found out it was the old-spice cologne that I had on.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:29.160
Smells ring bells.

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:34.640
One happy thought can spark an unending chain of things you experienced in school, it's

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:38.880
like being in school all over again.

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:44.920
Now one or two of us may have heard of Solomon, she was chef's key.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:49.160
He was born in Russia about 1866.

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:55.200
He had a memory so perfect that he could recall every minute of his life and that in graphic

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.200
detail.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:05.640
His talent for remembering was discovered when he was just a young lad of 19 years.

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.359
Now correct me if I'm wrong.

00:27:08.359 --> 00:27:20.829
I don't think there is a solitary soul in this class, male or female, with the recallability

00:27:20.829 --> 00:27:25.309
of Solomon, she was chef's key.

00:27:25.309 --> 00:27:32.349
Nevertheless you do have memories, and these memories will sustain you in the days ahead

00:27:32.349 --> 00:27:37.150
as you work for Jehovah in his service.

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:41.829
Now you're not going to remember everything you've seen and heard in class during the

00:27:41.829 --> 00:27:43.990
last five months.

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:44.990
Why?

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:48.069
There's just no need.

00:27:48.069 --> 00:27:54.789
An authority by the name of Aishish Rempura made this comment.

00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:56.269
See what you think about it.

00:27:56.269 --> 00:28:01.829
The human brain is not good at remembering long lists of unrelated numbers, dozens of

00:28:01.829 --> 00:28:10.670
nonsense words, or lengthy grocery lists, for these tasks little more is required than

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:14.390
pin and paper.

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:20.710
Now some in the medical profession have said, and I quote, we all carry in our personal

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:29.190
memory banks, pictures and memories of everything we have seen, done and heard since birth.

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:35.430
Others think that some things are so ordinary, so non-essential that they are not locked

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:40.349
in our memory banks, but are cast off.

00:28:40.349 --> 00:28:41.710
What do you think?

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:44.940
You students.

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:48.240
Like what you want.

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:59.319
There's no way for us to know, not now, maybe later.

00:28:59.319 --> 00:29:01.920
Here's something you no doubt will agree with.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:07.400
Jehovah can remember whatever he chooses to remember, and he can forget whatever he wants

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.720
to forget.

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:14.839
Now there's a mind that tops Solomon Shirisetsky.

00:29:14.839 --> 00:29:20.799
Jehovah's memory, our mind, is unfathomable, and here's an interesting comment from

00:29:20.799 --> 00:29:23.240
the Bible.

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:33.000
It's found here in 1 Corinthians chapter 2 and verse 16, it says, for who has come to

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:44.130
know the mind of Jehovah so that he may instruct him, but we do have the mind of Christ.

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:51.250
No, we can't know in detail God's mind.

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:57.289
He permits us to know just a little bit of it, and we're happy for that.

00:29:57.289 --> 00:29:59.170
But here's an interesting thought too.

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:06.809
He values us so much that he remembers every detail of our faithful service, our genetic

00:30:06.809 --> 00:30:16.650
code he remembers that, and all our years of memories and experiences God can recall.

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:18.369
Should you die?

00:30:18.369 --> 00:30:24.049
He will restore all this back in your new brain and body that he gives you.

00:30:24.049 --> 00:30:25.049
How do we know that?

00:30:25.049 --> 00:30:29.730
Well, Malachi chapter 3 and verse 16 makes a comment.

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:31.329
This is what it says.

00:30:31.329 --> 00:30:36.609
At that time, those who feared Jehovah spoke with one another, each one with his companion

00:30:36.609 --> 00:30:44.369
and Jehovah kept paying attention and listening, and now note, a book of remembrance was written

00:30:44.369 --> 00:30:52.289
before him for those fearing Jehovah and for those meditating on his name.

00:30:52.289 --> 00:30:56.809
God's thoughts are so much higher than ours.

00:30:56.809 --> 00:31:03.009
In the Bible book of Isaiah, it is stated in the 55th chapter, for my thoughts are not your

00:31:03.009 --> 00:31:10.609
thoughts, and your ways are not my ways declares Jehovah.

00:31:10.609 --> 00:31:14.890
Whereas the heavens are higher than the earth, so my ways are higher than your ways and

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:20.079
my thoughts than your thoughts.

00:31:20.079 --> 00:31:25.720
So we can never fully understand all of Jehovah's thoughts.

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:31.000
He gives us the ability with the help of the Holy Spirit to recall the thoughts we need

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.440
to apply in our lives in order to gain His pleasure.

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:37.880
So we need to do what?

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:42.279
We need to pray for Holy Spirit.

00:31:42.279 --> 00:31:49.640
Now each of our brothers who will speak to you today and those who have already had something

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:55.680
to say prayed for Holy Spirit before they ever stepped out here.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:59.960
I prayed at length back there for Holy Spirit.

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:04.759
So the book comes out of my mouth, will build you up and not tear you down.

00:32:04.759 --> 00:32:10.359
So the book comes out of my mouth, will honor Jehovah and please him and be a source of

00:32:10.359 --> 00:32:17.039
encouragement to all of my brothers and sisters who are able to hear what I have to say.

00:32:17.039 --> 00:32:22.039
So all of our brothers pray to that degree before they step out on this stage before an

00:32:22.039 --> 00:32:26.640
audience of your caliber, especially.

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:32.119
We want to make sure that what is said will be good for you.

00:32:32.119 --> 00:32:38.319
So God gives us the ability to understand a few things because of Holy Spirit.

00:32:38.319 --> 00:32:45.119
So we say to you, pray, please for Holy Spirit, the Spirit will refresh your memories and

00:32:45.119 --> 00:32:50.599
stimulate your mental powers, it's the Holy Spirit that will help you remember what

00:32:50.599 --> 00:32:55.759
you need to remember when you need to remember something.

00:32:55.759 --> 00:33:01.799
Now note this promise of Jesus, a John chapter 14 and verses 25 and 26.

00:33:01.799 --> 00:33:10.920
I have spoken these things to you while I am still with you, but the helper, the Holy

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:17.720
Spirit, which the Father will send in my name.

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:26.079
That one will teach you all things and bring back to your mind all the things I told you.

00:33:26.079 --> 00:33:36.119
In the weeks ahead, let the warm, beautiful memories of Gilead sustain you and thank

00:33:36.119 --> 00:33:40.490
Jehovah for it.

00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:43.049
They gave me nine minutes, I used 842.

00:33:43.049 --> 00:34:07.079
I just had to delete about four things I was considering the same, but anyway the translators

00:34:07.079 --> 00:34:14.679
will have fun with the Old Spice, brought back memories for me.

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:27.480
I used to love Old Spice by the way, used it a long time and so rather James Cawson, one

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:36.590
of the structures with theocratic schools, as the theme ego is your enemy.

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:43.550
There are a number of definitions for the expression ego, but for our brief discussion this

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:51.710
morning, we want to focus on the definition of ego as it's used in egotist, an unhealthy

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:58.750
belief in our own importance, the notion of ourselves that distorts reality.

00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:03.869
Now we're not picking that subject because we've noticed any particular problem and believe

00:35:03.869 --> 00:35:06.309
me, it's just been the opposite.

00:35:06.309 --> 00:35:12.670
But there is a tendency or a leaning that we have as imperfect people to become just

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:17.510
a little bit too self-assured, maybe a little bit too full of ourselves.

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:22.550
And that's why the apostle Paul, when he was talking about putting on the new personality

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:29.150
Romans chapter 12, he gave this reminder in verse 3.

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:34.710
He said, for through the undeserved kindness given to me, I tell everyone there among

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:40.110
you not to think more of himself than it's necessary to think, but to think so as to

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:43.829
have a sound mind.

00:35:43.829 --> 00:35:48.070
Now without going further we can see the balance.

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:53.869
If we have the right view of ourselves, well we have a sound mind, but as soon as we have

00:35:53.869 --> 00:36:00.550
an unbalanced view, then we have an unsound mind.

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:06.789
We have a tendency to become unbalanced, but the culture we live in today also fans

00:36:06.789 --> 00:36:09.269
the flames of ego.

00:36:09.269 --> 00:36:14.389
For example, it's never been easier today to talk oneself up, to puff oneself up, to

00:36:14.389 --> 00:36:26.829
brag oneself up, to thousands if not millions of so-called followers on social media.

00:36:26.829 --> 00:36:35.429
But humility will help us to see that perhaps others are not quite as interested in our

00:36:35.429 --> 00:36:39.730
accomplishments as we are.

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:46.090
So a self-worth is realizing that you have value.

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:51.719
Self-importance is wanting everyone else to know it.

00:36:51.719 --> 00:36:57.079
Open your Bibles, if you would, to 1 Corinthians chapter 8.

00:36:57.079 --> 00:37:05.519
1 Corinthians chapter 8, and we want to give just four brief reminders.

00:37:05.519 --> 00:37:13.650
1 Corinthians chapter 8 and verse 1.

00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:19.489
It says, knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.

00:37:19.489 --> 00:37:22.369
It's not enough to be a student at the beginning.

00:37:22.369 --> 00:37:26.210
It's a position that you must assume for life.

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:31.809
It's impossible to learn what one thinks he already knows.

00:37:31.809 --> 00:37:39.690
The second we tell ourselves that we have graduated, learning grinds to a halt.

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:46.809
A good mind is certainly a fine asset, and still it could become a weakness if overconfidence

00:37:46.809 --> 00:37:51.449
causes us to develop an inflated opinion of ourselves.

00:37:51.449 --> 00:37:55.730
Now you haven't had that happen, and likely it won't happen.

00:37:55.730 --> 00:38:03.929
But after you graduate, as a Gilead graduate, you will find that people will compliment

00:38:03.929 --> 00:38:08.929
you, perhaps they will even flatter you excessively.

00:38:08.929 --> 00:38:13.170
And when that happens, try to remember this.

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:17.570
A smart man believes only half of what people say about him.

00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:21.929
A wise man knows which half to believe.

00:38:21.929 --> 00:38:29.570
So continue to let the Word of God and the Spirit of God make you more like the Son of God.

00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:35.090
Proverbs 10, 14, those who are wise, treasure up knowledge.

00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:39.769
But don't let the knowledge go to your head.

00:38:39.769 --> 00:38:41.250
Just to your head.

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:44.170
Let it go to your heart.

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:50.320
Second area, turn to Matthew chapter 20.

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:55.960
And you can leave your Bible open here, if you'd like, Matthew 20, verse 28, and this goes

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:59.039
right to the heart of your Gilead assignment.

00:38:59.039 --> 00:39:00.039
All right?

00:39:00.039 --> 00:39:01.880
Jesus said this.

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:08.440
He said, just as a son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister.

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:14.960
And so Jesus measured greatness in terms of service, not status.

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:18.320
He willingly took up menial tasks that everyone else tried to avoid.

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.320
He would wash feet.

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.239
He would take care of children.

00:39:21.239 --> 00:39:25.559
Jesus, the Bible says, emptied himself.

00:39:25.559 --> 00:39:27.039
But you know what?

00:39:27.039 --> 00:39:32.739
You can't empty yourself if you're full of yourself.

00:39:32.739 --> 00:39:38.539
Now imagine that for every person you met, you found some way to help them, a way that

00:39:38.539 --> 00:39:43.860
entirely fitted them left you entirely out of the picture.

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:49.340
The cumulative effect that this would have on the brotherhood over a period of time would

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:51.099
be profound.

00:39:51.099 --> 00:39:52.699
And it's not an original idea.

00:39:52.699 --> 00:39:58.139
You see, Jehovah God, Jesus Christ looked for opportunities to do for others.

00:39:58.139 --> 00:40:02.579
And it's not about making someone look good.

00:40:02.579 --> 00:40:09.139
It's about providing the support so that others can be good.

00:40:09.139 --> 00:40:15.019
Strive to be self-less, not selfish.

00:40:15.019 --> 00:40:20.179
Philippians 2 verse 3 says, do nothing out of contentiousness or out of egotism, but

00:40:20.179 --> 00:40:25.380
with humility, consider others superior to you.

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:31.340
Now back to Matthew, this time, chapter 20, beginning in verse 25.

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:35.699
This is the third area.

00:40:35.699 --> 00:40:40.619
Jesus, talking to His disciples, said, you know that the rulers of the nations lorded

00:40:40.619 --> 00:40:45.260
over them and the great men wheeled authority over them.

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:50.260
This must not be the way among you, but whoever wants to become great among, you must be

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:55.900
your minister and whoever wants to be first among, you must be your slave.

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:59.460
Now, you're going to leave here.

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:05.139
Some of you are going to be put in positions of oversight, but all of you, brothers and

00:41:05.139 --> 00:41:08.420
sisters, are expected to work as a team.

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:11.980
So try to remember these things.

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:19.420
Having authority is not necessarily the same as being an authority.

00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:24.099
Having the right is not necessarily the same as being right.

00:41:24.099 --> 00:41:28.860
Impressing people is different from being truly impressive.

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:33.260
And learn the difference between prominence and significance.

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:39.300
See, some of the most significant people in our organization are the ones that have almost

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:40.300
no prominence.

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:45.460
They're the ones that are showing integrity, standing firm for the kingdom, setting an

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:52.380
example in the ministry, and making sacrifices that may be only Jehovah, Jesus, and a holy

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:54.139
angel's no.

00:41:54.139 --> 00:41:56.260
They're significant.

00:41:56.260 --> 00:42:04.179
So don't get caught up into the trap of jockeying for position or prominence in the organization,

00:42:04.179 --> 00:42:11.099
because if you do, that ego that is developing will cause you to become a minister to the

00:42:11.099 --> 00:42:15.059
brothers and sisters that have to work under your direction.

00:42:15.059 --> 00:42:20.579
The watchtower put it like this, it said, ego always be clouds the issue and obscures

00:42:20.579 --> 00:42:21.820
the vision.

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:27.619
And remember this too, a teen player does not obsess about his own image.

00:42:27.619 --> 00:42:32.019
He doesn't treat people with contempt, doesn't need star treatment, doesn't fight, doesn't

00:42:32.019 --> 00:42:41.360
lord it over, isn't condescending, and doesn't marvel at his own awesomeness.

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:48.559
Colossians 323, whatever you're doing, work at it whole soul for Jehovah, not to men.

00:42:48.559 --> 00:42:54.280
And finally, one last point, and this is founded 1 Corinthians 1012, we're not going

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:57.000
to look it up because there's simply not time.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:03.159
But it says this, says let him that thinks he's standing beware that he does not fall.

00:43:03.159 --> 00:43:08.199
Humble people are meek, they're not weak.

00:43:08.199 --> 00:43:12.880
Spiritual maturity is becoming like Jesus in the way we think, feel and act.

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:15.880
But self deception is easy.

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:20.760
Beware of the disease of me.

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:27.119
Even the best qualities will have a short shelf life if the subscription is not renewed.

00:43:27.119 --> 00:43:30.039
It's not enough to do the right thing.

00:43:30.039 --> 00:43:34.079
You must do the right thing for the right reason.

00:43:34.079 --> 00:43:41.400
James 410 says, humble yourselves in the eyes of Jehovah and he will exalt you.

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:47.679
So in conclusion, it's admirable to reach out Jehovah's organization to take on additional

00:43:47.679 --> 00:43:51.159
responsibilities to make sacrifices.

00:43:51.159 --> 00:43:58.360
But it is no less impressive an accomplishment to become a better person, happier, balanced,

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:01.079
content, humble and selfless.

00:44:01.079 --> 00:44:05.360
But to do so, we must remember, ego is your enemy.

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:21.130
Thank you very much for the coffin, we appreciate it that.

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:26.130
Next to the brother William Mellon Fountain, who's a helper to the teaching committee, has

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:33.840
the theme, test Jehovah out and be tested.

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:44.960
You students of the 141st class of Gilead have been putting Jehovah to the test for years.

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:53.960
It sounds scary, but you've been doing it in a good way, a way that honors Jehovah God.

00:44:53.960 --> 00:45:00.920
On the other hand, the Israelites often tested Jehovah in a bad way.

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:10.039
Psalm 106, verse 14, declares, they gave way to their selfish desires in the wilderness.

00:45:10.039 --> 00:45:13.400
They tested God in the desert.

00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:20.079
Yes, they tested Jehovah by their lack of faith, by their disobedience to what they had

00:45:20.079 --> 00:45:23.639
agreed to do in the law covenant.

00:45:23.639 --> 00:45:26.760
And it was all to their own detriment.

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:32.559
And Jesus commented on this point of not testing Jehovah God when He replied to Satan at

00:45:32.559 --> 00:45:42.280
Matthew 4.7, you recall the words, you must not put Jehovah your God to the test.

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:50.880
Jesus refused to do anything that would put His life in jeopardy, do something reckless

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:54.840
just to please a challenge from the devil.

00:45:54.840 --> 00:46:00.400
That would be a wrong way to put Jehovah God to the test.

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:06.840
However, as students of this class, you know about Malachi and you know that there is

00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:11.079
an invitation in the scriptures to test Jehovah out.

00:46:11.079 --> 00:46:13.880
Let's look up the scripture together.

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:26.159
Malachi, chapter 3, verse 10, it had to do with the Israelites and tithing, obeying Jehovah's

00:46:26.159 --> 00:46:27.639
command.

00:46:27.639 --> 00:46:34.400
Malachi 3.10 says, bring the entire tithe into the storehouse so that there may be food

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.320
in my house.

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:43.360
And test me out, please, in this regard, Jehovah of Army says, to see whether I will not

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:49.760
open to you the floodgates of the heavens and pour out on you a blessing until there

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:52.920
is nothing lacking.

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:54.199
That's quite a statement.

00:46:54.199 --> 00:47:03.280
Jehovah said, test me out, please, in this regard, in regard to being obedient, to accept

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:08.519
Jehovah's invitation, to trust Jehovah and his promise to bless them.

00:47:08.519 --> 00:47:17.239
In regard to not being tight-fisted and greedy, after all, everything the Israelites had came

00:47:17.239 --> 00:47:18.920
from Jehovah.

00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:25.199
They were merely asked to give back a small portion of the things that Jehovah God had

00:47:25.199 --> 00:47:28.119
provided for them.

00:47:28.119 --> 00:47:32.000
You know there was no penalty for not tithing.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.199
The arrangement, actually, when you study, it had a lot to do with the heart condition

00:47:36.199 --> 00:47:43.880
of the people and their appreciation for all of the good things that Jehovah did for them.

00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:50.199
Obedience would result in blessings and abundance of good things, bumper crops.

00:47:50.199 --> 00:47:53.320
No one in the land would be lacking.

00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:58.039
Jehovah's blessing would be on them in all of their undertakings.

00:47:58.039 --> 00:48:04.880
But think about the word picture that Malachi paints in the last part of verse 10, the power

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:11.840
of that word picture, the floodgates of the heavens being opened and pouring out blessings.

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:16.280
What comes to your mind when you hear that expression, the floodgates of the heavens being

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:18.079
opened?

00:48:18.079 --> 00:48:27.760
For me, Genesis 7, 11, and it says, in the 600 year of Noah's life, in the second

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:34.000
month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the springs of the vast

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:41.119
watery, deep, burst open and the floodgates of the heavens were opened.

00:48:41.119 --> 00:48:49.199
Just imagine the entire planet being submerged in blessings from Jehovah.

00:48:49.199 --> 00:48:54.039
No one anywhere in want or in need.

00:48:54.039 --> 00:48:55.679
That's the promise from Jehovah.

00:48:55.679 --> 00:48:59.320
It's coming and soon.

00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:05.400
The invitation to test Jehovah out as set forth in Malachi chapter 3 verse 10 was given

00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:12.360
to the Israelites as we know it was not given to Christians as far as tithing is concerned.

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:18.880
But there is a principle connected to tithing that has special meaning for us today.

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:22.280
Consider this quote about testing God.

00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:26.039
It says, you can humbly test Him in a proper sense.

00:49:26.039 --> 00:49:27.519
How?

00:49:27.519 --> 00:49:33.480
He promised a blessing, well, such as Malachi 3, 10, bring the whole tithe in and I will bless

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:34.800
you abundantly.

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:40.519
For us, it could be Matthew 6, 33, seek first the kingdom and all these other things will

00:49:40.519 --> 00:49:42.480
be added to you.

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:49.980
But the quote goes on, when you obey Him, you make a test of God as if asking, will He

00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:51.780
bless me?

00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:58.280
In response, He puts Himself under obligation to do so, keeping His promise, thus God's

00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:06.219
allowing you to test Him out underscores your conviction that He will bless you abundantly.

00:50:06.219 --> 00:50:12.579
And that's taken from the book, Live with Jehovah's Day in Mine on page 183.

00:50:12.579 --> 00:50:19.099
The fact is that when we put Jehovah to the test regarding His promises, we are also putting

00:50:19.179 --> 00:50:24.420
our own faith in His promises to the test.

00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:27.980
This has been and still is your experience.

00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:33.340
By seeking first the kingdom, you gillied students, haven't you been blessed abundantly?

00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:39.539
Materially, you have what you need, spiritually a super abundance of blessings have been poured

00:50:39.539 --> 00:50:41.699
out on you.

00:50:41.699 --> 00:50:46.739
Have you not received blessings beyond measure in acquaintances, fellowship, happiness,

00:50:46.739 --> 00:50:54.219
enjoy the people now that you're close to in your class and also here at Patterson?

00:50:54.219 --> 00:50:55.619
You know what life is all about.

00:50:55.619 --> 00:50:57.380
You know what the purpose of life is.

00:50:57.380 --> 00:51:05.380
Why we're here to serve God, to know Jehovah and to learn about our great creator and

00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:07.099
the way we should worship Him.

00:51:07.099 --> 00:51:11.820
And what the blessings that we're receiving, all of the good things we have, it's just

00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:18.179
a foretaste of things to come, things in the near future.

00:51:18.179 --> 00:51:23.699
And I might add, you students are not the only ones who are testing Jehovah out.

00:51:23.699 --> 00:51:28.920
I found this quote interesting from the watchtower about another group.

00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:33.679
The watchtower stated, most of those who have assisted with the construction work in New

00:51:33.679 --> 00:51:37.440
York could have found reasons not to volunteer.

00:51:37.519 --> 00:51:43.719
However, they put Jehovah to the test just as he invites all of us to do and have they

00:51:43.719 --> 00:51:49.840
not received rich blessings from Jehovah in return, just ask them, they'll tell you.

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:52.519
And then the last part I like very much.

00:51:52.519 --> 00:51:56.400
And do we not love them for their faith?

00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:58.920
Absolutely.

00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:05.159
Another group, the anointed test Jehovah and they are being tested.

00:52:05.159 --> 00:52:15.039
Revelation chapter 2 verse 10, prove yourself faithful even to death, the test, but the reward

00:52:15.039 --> 00:52:19.079
and I will give you the crown of life.

00:52:19.079 --> 00:52:20.079
Isn't that remarkable?

00:52:20.079 --> 00:52:26.440
The promises that God makes, that principle applies to all of us.

00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:32.320
When we make our dedication and our baptize, we vow to serve Jehovah God forever.

00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:33.320
You know that.

00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:35.119
We know that.

00:52:35.159 --> 00:52:37.719
But there is an interesting point connected to that.

00:52:37.719 --> 00:52:42.199
There is more involved than just our person.

00:52:42.199 --> 00:52:45.199
Consider this comment from the watchtower.

00:52:45.199 --> 00:52:53.679
From that time on, dedication and baptism, everything we have belongs to Jehovah.

00:52:53.679 --> 00:52:58.719
Now some may separate their person from their possessions, not realizing that really,

00:52:58.719 --> 00:53:03.599
when you give yourself to God, it's all you are and all that you have.

00:53:03.599 --> 00:53:08.719
And yet here is where the tithe or the principle of the tithe comes in.

00:53:08.719 --> 00:53:15.719
Still, and this is part of that quote, from the watchtower of 2007, December 15, still,

00:53:15.719 --> 00:53:25.280
he allows us to choose a portion of what we have, a symbolic tithe, to use in his service.

00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:32.039
It is whatever our circumstances allow and the second part is touching.

00:53:32.039 --> 00:53:35.679
Then our heart impels us to use.

00:53:35.679 --> 00:53:38.719
Isn't that wonderful on Jehovah's part?

00:53:38.719 --> 00:53:41.320
He doesn't set forth a specific requirement.

00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:48.119
He allows us to display our heartfelt appreciation for him and for all the good things that

00:53:48.119 --> 00:53:50.119
he does for us.

00:53:50.119 --> 00:53:52.280
The heart is truly involved.

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:57.920
We test Jehovah God out by doing what Proverbs 23, 26 says,

00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:05.840
My son, do give your heart to me, and may your eyes take pleasure in my ways.

00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:11.599
We give Jehovah God our heart, and we give him everything else that we have as the needs

00:54:11.599 --> 00:54:13.400
arise.

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:15.360
What a wonderful opportunity we have.

00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:20.360
It gives us this opportunity of showing how much we appreciate our great God and how much

00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:22.400
we trust him.

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:30.280
In this interesting statement was made, to fail to give Jehovah our best is to deprive

00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:36.639
ourselves of his blessings, isn't that true?

00:54:36.639 --> 00:54:42.320
You brothers and sisters of the 141st Class of Gilead, you are not depriving yourselves

00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:43.559
of anything.

00:54:43.559 --> 00:54:49.920
You have the spiritual blessings and you have what you need materially, no doubt about it.

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:56.320
And as you continue testing Jehovah out by responding to his promises, the quality of

00:54:56.320 --> 00:55:01.920
your faith will continue to be tested and refined.

00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:06.519
And so keep on testing Jehovah out.

00:55:06.519 --> 00:55:14.400
Keep on doing the best you can to obey him, to comply, to show your faith in his promises,

00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:21.880
and then you will also be tested to your eternal joy and happiness.

00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:37.280
Thank you, or the male and female for that fine council.

00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:48.119
We invite you all to stand now, sing song number 43, stay awake, stand firm, grow mighty,

00:55:48.119 --> 00:55:49.320
song number 43.
