00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:09.519
Jesus' words in Matthew 11, 28 are very appropriate considering everything we go through in the system of things.

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:16.519
Come to me, all you who are toiling and loaded down, and I will refresh you.

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:22.519
Yes, conventions can be of refreshment to us, giving us the boost we need.

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:28.519
But such refreshment is also available when the world around us seems to be falling apart.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.520
How does the organization help our brothers and sisters in times of national crisis?

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.520
We met two witness couples who personally experienced two of the largest terrorist attacks in recent years.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.020
Not a day goes by when we don't think about our son poorly.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.819
There was horror and suffering.

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:08.819
Things we don't want to witness anymore.

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:24.250
September 11th was a very scary, terrifying day.

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:27.879
I was for me.

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:31.879
When I really understood what was happening, I got scared.

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:34.879
I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what to think.

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:36.879
I felt helpless.

00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:44.420
When the second time I felt poorly was on 110th floor.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.420
And everybody was shouting, crying.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.420
I was praying to Jehovah.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.420
Because I was heartbroken.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.069
We live on the Voltaire Boulevard.

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:01.069
It's a broad avenue.

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:04.069
There is a concert hall called the Bataclan.

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:10.069
When the doors of the Bataclan are open, we can hear everything that goes on inside.

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:19.069
That night, three men entered the Bataclan concert hall and they started shooting into the crowd.

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.069
We immediately grabbed our gold bags and then we sat in front of the sofa.

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:34.580
And we begged Jehovah for his holy spirit so we could face the situation.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.580
It was around 10 pm when there was a news flash that announced that there was an attack.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.580
I was in shock when I heard the news.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.580
And then I immediately thought about our brothers and sisters.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:05.580
I quickly got in contact with the circuit officer in order to get some news about our brothers and sisters to know how they were doing.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:13.580
Then, very early the next morning, we set up an emergency committee made up of several brothers from the service department.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:24.960
We decided to write a letter and make other arrangements to assist the friends who in one way or another were affected by this event.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:34.960
In turn, the circuit officer would make an effort to rapidly get in touch with the elders who oversee the affected territory.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:47.960
One of our challenges on a personal level was whether we would even be able to encourage our brothers and sisters because we had never experienced such a terrible event.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.960
We organized ourselves, we paired up as elders and headed off to do shepherding.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.960
We started calling mid-morning on Tuesday.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.960
We received a report back from all the traveling overseers by the end of Thursday.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:11.340
Then, unfortunately, we learned that 14 of our brothers and sisters had lost their lives.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.339
We knew that we needed to encourage the families.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:20.339
We knew that we needed to shepherd them as soon as possible.

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:24.339
The elders immediately came.

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:29.339
We went over the book of Job and I just listened.

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:31.339
I was just listening.

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:34.339
We were the same words before but it was different now.

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:38.339
The things that were being said went straight to my heart.

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:43.339
A few days later, we were visited by two brothers from Bethel.

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:48.339
It was very touching that they came to see us and that they were concerned about us.

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:54.339
It shows us that Jehovah was aware of how we felt that night.

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:58.339
Our brothers were there. They were ready to help one another out.

00:04:58.339 --> 00:05:02.339
Then there was so much empathy and love shown.

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:06.339
When we were ultimately granted access to ground zero

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:10.339
and we started encountering the first responders.

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:14.339
We let them know how much we appreciated their hard work

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:17.339
and that they had a skill set that we didn't have.

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:22.339
But yet our skill set was trying to offer comfort to them.

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:24.339
We shared a scripture with them.

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:31.339
Immediately we could tell that that was something that caused emotion to rise up in them right away.

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:34.339
And they expressed great appreciation for that.

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:41.339
It's one of the beautiful things about the scriptures is that they're calming, soothing, comforting.

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:46.339
And the scriptures did not let down the workers that were there at ground zero either.

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:53.639
The visit of the brothers from Bethel was really a gift from Jehovah.

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:59.639
It showed his genuine interest in us. It was really wonderful.

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:05.639
After the brothers visited us, we felt so comforted.

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:08.639
So encouraged that we said to each other,

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:13.639
we have to get back in the ministry and comfort people in the territory.

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:17.639
We have to console our brothers and sisters as well.

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:22.639
We can only thank and glorify Jehovah who really is a God of love.

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:33.529
I kind of felt Jehovah's hands just reaching out to me,

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:37.000
which I needed.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
But I cannot wait to the day that I'm totally refreshed where I can see.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.410
I can actually see a poorly.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:50.410
I can see him just coming back into our lives.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:56.579
And I want to embrace him so much.

00:06:56.579 --> 00:07:03.899
After something like this, we are not the same.

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:10.899
With the help of the organization, the brothers, Jehovah's death for us.

00:07:10.899 --> 00:07:16.300
So that is refreshing.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.300
And I thank Jehovah a lot for what he wants to do for me,

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:28.300
but also for the millions of people that feel the same way.
