00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.060
Illustrations are powerful teaching tools.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.059
They help to explain complex ideas.

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:23.059
They also stimulate thinking and can break down prejudice.

00:00:23.059 --> 00:00:28.059
Illustrations stir emotions and appeal to the heart.

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:31.059
They're also memory aids.

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:36.060
It's no wonder then that Jesus made good use of them.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.060
Here are three things that will make your illustrations effective.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.060
Select simple illustrations.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.060
Choose them with your listeners in mind

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.060
and use them to teach the points that are truly important.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.060
Listen to the following illustration and see if it's effective.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:02.380
Furthermore, the world is passing away and so is its desire.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.379
But the one who does the will of God remains forever.

00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:12.379
If the world is passing away and life in this system of things is temporary,

00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:16.379
shouldn't that affect how we use our time and energy?

00:01:16.379 --> 00:01:21.379
For example, imagine you're going on a seven-day European cruise.

00:01:21.379 --> 00:01:30.379
The ports of color are Lisbon, Gibraltar, Barcelona, Monte Carlo, Florence and Rome.

00:01:30.379 --> 00:01:35.379
Because the ship will have many activities, you've chosen an inside cabin.

00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:41.379
Although the room is nicely decorated, it's not exactly your taste.

00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:47.379
For example, you don't like the brightly colored carpet and walls that are common on many cruise ships.

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:52.379
Also, the bed's bed and curtains are not what you would have chosen.

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:56.379
You have a refrigerator in the room, but it's small.

00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:59.379
Would you spend time redecorating the room?

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:01.379
Maybe put down a new carpet.

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:03.379
Paint the room a different color.

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:07.379
Hang new curtains or purchase a larger refrigerator.

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:09.379
Of course not.

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.379
Your stay is only temporary.

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.379
Similarly, our stay in this system of things is only temporary.

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:25.379
Does it make sense that we would spend time and energy to make our life as comfortable as possible?

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:32.379
Although this illustration made a good point, was it as effective as it could have been?

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.379
Was it simple?

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:43.379
Well, was it necessary for the audience to know the reason for the trip, how long the cruise was, or the cities where the ship was stopping?

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:48.379
No, these details actually complicated the illustration.

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.379
Here's something else.

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:54.379
Did the speaker have his listeners in mind?

00:02:54.379 --> 00:03:01.379
Probably few in his audience have taken a cruise, so it would be hard for them to identify with the situation.

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:12.379
Therefore, the point of the illustration could be lost, or their minds might be diverted to the speaker rather than his message.

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:17.379
How might the speaker have illustrated the same point more effectively?

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.939
Let's watch him try again.

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:25.939
Furthermore, the world is passing away, and so is its desire.

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:29.939
But the one who does the will of God remains forever.

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:35.939
If the world is passing away, and our life in this system of things is temporary,

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:39.939
shouldn't that affect how we use our time and energy?

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:45.939
For example, imagine that you're visiting relatives in another village for a few days.

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:47.939
They kindly give you a room.

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:52.939
However, the bed's not as comfortable as yours.

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:57.939
The walls could use a few more pictures, and there's no window.

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:02.939
Would you purchase a larger bed for your stay, and some pictures for the walls?

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:05.939
Or would you take time to install a window?

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:07.939
Of course not.

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:10.939
You're only staying a few days.

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:18.939
We might relocate the chairs and tables, and a few simple things to make our surroundings more comfortable during our temporary stay.

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:25.939
But we would not go to great effort or expense to redecorate the entire room.

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:32.939
In like manner, we keep matters simple during our temporary residency in this old system,

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:37.939
giving our main focus to kingdom interests.

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:40.939
Jesus illustrations were simple.

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:49.939
For example, the kingdom of the heavens is like leaven that a woman took and mixed with three large measures of flour

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:52.939
until the whole mass was fermented.

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:58.939
It's just one sentence about baking bread, a situation familiar to his audience.

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:04.939
This simplicity made Jesus illustrations appeal to the heart.

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:10.939
Jesus also used illustrations to teach main points, not minor details.

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:14.939
So use illustrations selectively.

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:20.939
If you were to use an illustration to teach a minor detail, your audience may remember the illustration

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:23.939
but not the point of instruction.

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:26.939
How can you find appropriate illustrations?

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:27.939
Be observant.

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:30.939
Look at the world around you.

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:35.939
Study our Christian publications and listen to skilled teachers.

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:40.939
Some experience teacher save illustrations in a file to use later.

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:48.939
If you want to teach like Jesus, enhance your teaching with simple illustrations that appeal to your listeners

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:51.939
and that teach main points.
