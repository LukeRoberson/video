00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:20.089
Nerdup is a small island about 10 to 15 minutes by boat from the Panama mainland.

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:26.449
Life on these islands is simple, though this one, in particular, is special.

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.410
Even though the island only has 24 inhabitants, seven of them,

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.609
along with five from other islands,

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:38.770
attend the only congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses in the region.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.890
Bundetahada is one of them,

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.770
though until very recently she could neither read nor write.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.130
I wanted to learn about the Bible,

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.450
even though I didn't know how to read.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.969
My parents didn't send me to school,

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.700
but my brother taught me a little.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.179
I felt that books spoke to people,

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:07.379
but to me, they were speechless.

00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:09.980
My teacher even said that books could talk,

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.299
but I was never able to hear them.

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:16.980
When I saw people going to the Kingdom Hall, I thought,

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.379
these meetings look good, I should go too.

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:22.019
I knew that no one would say,

00:01:22.019 --> 00:01:23.219
why are you here?

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:25.340
You won't understand anything.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.939
That's why I started going to meetings,

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.459
and I've never stopped since.

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:32.180
Sometimes it's difficult,

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.180
but I know if I miss a meeting, I will feel bad.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.260
So even if I can only listen, I still go.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.420
Some people don't like to see you progressing.

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:45.260
They say,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.500
boom, I think she's a man always with her books.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.700
Even one of my brothers, who has since passed away,

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.379
used to tell me the same.

00:01:57.379 --> 00:02:02.700
At first, I felt a shame reading in front of others,

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.260
and sometimes I still feel ashamed,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.740
so I would wait until I was alone at night before I read.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.139
But I did not always understand.

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:15.939
I needed someone to help me, to encourage me,

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:17.860
and explain what I was reading.

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:23.219
At first, there was only material in Spanish,

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:24.979
so that's all I had.

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:26.419
I don't speak Spanish,

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:28.780
so I didn't understand anything,

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.460
and nobody could explain to me in Guna what was written.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.819
It was like a secret.

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.460
I really appreciate what I've learned about Jehovah.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.060
If I didn't know about him, I would be like everyone else.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.580
Studying the Bible has helped me to understand right from wrong.

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:57.740
When the videos are in Guna, I can understand them very well.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.740
I love that the videos encourage Guna speakers to attend the meetings.

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:12.620
I have seen that preaching from door to door makes you happy.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.259
When I think about it, I would like to be able to preach more freely like others do.

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:19.500
But we're very isolated here,

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.580
and it is hard to leave this island.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.310
When I see pictures of the paradise, I want to be there.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.550
I want to survive and live there.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.870
In the future, the earth will be a paradise.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.710
There is no doubt at all.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.949
This motivates me to learn more.

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:43.189
I really wanted to reach my heart.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.590
Thanks to the efforts of our brothers in translation offices,

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:54.150
even those with little or no education can grasp Bible truths and come to know God.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.990
Jehovah's organization cares for us all.

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:08.759
Even the little ones, I want to be among those taught by Jehovah in this organization.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.080
By the work they do, I can see that Jehovah cares even for me.
