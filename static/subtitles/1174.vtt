00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:12.779
Thinking back, I thought I knew what it meant to show love, but I had a lot to learn.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.779
Come on.

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:16.780
We're back this for hours.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.780
We need sleep.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:32.880
Just five minutes.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:33.880
Ben?

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.880
Carl's been calling.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.880
You really should pay him another visit.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.880
Grace says he's not doing too good.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.880
I will, I promise.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.880
Just as soon as I get past this talk.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.880
I'd known Carl and Grace since I was 17.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.560
Carl had been my spiritual dad.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:09.500
He was always there for me.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:20.109
And with him being in and out of the hospital, I tried to be there for them.

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:24.109
But I'd just been so busy.

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:48.159
It seemed like so many new responsibilities hit me all at once.

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.159
Brother Capra, do you have a second?

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.159
Hey, Capra, maybe a little later, okay?

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:05.120
But I figured once my schedule freed up, I'd make more time for everyone, including Carl.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:18.479
What I didn't realize is how quickly time can run out.

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:24.479
Grace said no one could know he'd pass so suddenly and not to beat myself up about it.

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:30.479
But I knew I would lament that decision for a long time.

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:37.479
I never again wanted to miss an opportunity to show love.

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:41.479
Brother Capra, do you have a second?

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:43.479
Hey, Kevin, how's it going?

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:56.319
What?

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:07.039
Realize that learning to show love more fully vind would help prepare us for what lay ahead.

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:16.919
Eventually, showing love would call for even greater sacrifices.

00:03:17.919 --> 00:04:15.409
I'm so glad that I never gave up in learning to show love and that Jehovah never gave up on me.

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:28.009
When I see Carl, I have centuries of happy memories, centuries of showing him and all of my brothers and sisters, loyal love.
