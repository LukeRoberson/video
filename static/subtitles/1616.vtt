00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:14.750
On this account, I say to you, stop being anxious about your lives as to what you will

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:22.660
eat or what you will drink or about your bodies as to what you will wear.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.539
Does not life mean more than food?

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:32.820
And the body, then clothing, observe intently the birds of heaven.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:43.969
They do not so seed or reap or gather into storehouses, yet your heavenly Father feeds

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:49.479
them.

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:51.280
Are you not worth more than they are?
