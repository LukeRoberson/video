00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.059
the harvest.

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:08.500
What do those words bring to your mind?

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.140
A resplendent golden season with plentiful work and good food?

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.140
Yes.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.500
But isn't it also true that the harvest implies urgency?

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.500
Harvest can't wait.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.260
The crop has to be brought in.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.620
The rains might cut short the days, or soak the grain.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.339
Everyone is needed to get the job done.

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:35.340
And what does that suggest about the way in which we must work during the figurative

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.100
harvest that Jesus was talking about here?

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:46.460
Let's examine the context of Jesus' words, beginning in Matthew 9.35, and notice what

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:55.700
Jesus was doing, how it made him feel, and what specific actions and attitudes he recommended

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:04.739
either directly or by his example, Matthew 9, verse 35.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.500
It says, Jesus set out on a tour of all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.620
and preaching the good news of the kingdom, and curing every sort of disease and every

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.140
sort of infirmity.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.780
This was Jesus' third tour of Galilee.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.819
He was teaching, preaching, and curing.

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:26.980
What effect did it have on him, verse 36?

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.760
When seeing the crowds, he felt pity for them because they were skinned and thrown

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.700
about like sheep without a shepherd.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.620
The footnote tells us that the verb here for pity denotes a feeling experienced deep inside

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:50.019
the body, an intense emotion, one of the strongest words in Greek for compassion.

00:01:50.019 --> 00:01:55.620
Compassion for people who were, as the footnotes indicate, maltreated, harassed, wounded, helpless,

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:03.540
exhausted, dejected, and neglected, crowds who needed God's kingdom.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:10.860
Thus, Jesus said in verse 37, yes, the harvest is great, but the workers are few.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.740
The harvest, he called it, a short period of time in which many people are needed to

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.060
accomplish a great work.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.060
What would Jesus recommend?

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.860
People notice, verse 38, fervent prayer, therefore beg the master of the harvest to send out

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.780
workers into his harvest.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.259
But did Jesus just leave it at that?

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:36.259
Not at all.

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:41.539
Notice the next verse, chapter 10 and verse 1.

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:47.539
So he summoned his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits in order

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:52.819
to expel these and to cure every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity.

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.979
The very work that Jesus was doing back in chapter 9, verse 35.

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:05.659
So here we find Jesus delegating authority, giving his disciples permission and real power

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.259
to perform mighty deeds.

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:16.139
He also organized his apostles, and verses 2 through 4, we find their names, but this is

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:23.699
not just a list of names like the one we find in Luke chapter 6 verses 13 through 16.

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:29.539
The Luke listing centers around events that occurred months earlier before Jesus' second

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:37.180
tour of Galilee, whereas this listing in Matthew deals with Jesus' third tour of Galilee.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.180
And whereas Luke's list contains twelve names and eleven commas between the complete names,

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:51.300
this list separates the names not by commas, but by the word and used not eleven times,

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.819
but six times.

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.460
Yes, this is a list defining six teams.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.300
So in verses 2 through 4, the apostles get a partner.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.740
In verses 5 and 6, they get a territory.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:10.180
In verse 7, they get a message centering on the kingdom.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:18.860
In verses 11 and 12, they are told to search out each city for deserving ones at their

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.660
homes.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:29.339
By the way, did Jehovah, the master of the harvest, answer their plea for more harvest workers?

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:36.220
About a year later, Jesus dispatched 70 more disciples, so 82 in all.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.899
Did that relieve some of the pressure, reduce some of the urgency of the situation?

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:51.420
Well, notice what Jesus said about this at Luke chapter 10 and verse 2.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.180
Then He said to them, yes, the harvest is great, but the workers are few.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.180
Therefore beg the master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:08.699
The wording is identical to that found at Matthew chapter 9 verses 37 and 38, isn't it?

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:15.779
Jesus' assessment of the need was exactly the same.

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:20.300
Well now how can we be sure that all of this applies to us?

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.819
Notice what Jesus said right here in his original instructions in Matthew chapter 10 and

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:28.220
verse 23.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.379
When they persecute you in one city, flee to another.

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:38.060
For truly I say to you, you will by no means complete the circuit of the cities of Israel

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.860
until the Son of Man arrives.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.860
Yes, these words apply not only to those living in the first century, but to those living

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.420
when the Son of Man arrives.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:57.339
And that also means that between now and Armageddon there will be plenty of territory.

00:05:57.339 --> 00:06:05.980
Remember too that Jesus said at Matthew 13 verses 38 and 39, the field is the world.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:10.699
And the harvest is a conclusion of a system of things.

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:19.300
So while it's true that we have more workers than ever before, the circumstances keep changing.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:26.339
When the harvest season began back in 1914, Earth's population was just then cresting

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:29.019
1.6 billion.

00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:32.779
Well today billions more need to hear the truth.

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:35.420
So we do this work as Jesus instructed.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.180
We pray fervently for more workers and we get organized.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:46.939
We get a partner, a territory, a kingdom presentation, and then we search systematically.

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:50.420
In the past few years, under the direction of the service committee of the governing

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:56.220
body, a number of special preaching campaigns have been organized in very remote or

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.860
densely populated territories.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:05.459
And the results confirm that the harvest is still great, and the workers are still few.

00:07:05.459 --> 00:07:11.420
For instance, after a recent four-month campaign to reach Amara, speaking people on the Andean

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:17.339
plateau of Peru, an elder reported that way up in the mountains they found a group of people

00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:23.540
meeting twice a week to study my book of Bible stories and the greatest man who ever lived.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:28.420
Well, the group was surprised to find out that these books were published by Jehovah's

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:33.019
Witnesses, and those conducting the meetings agreed to study with our brothers during

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:34.220
the campaign.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:39.620
Many attended, and they were happy to find out about our website, and now some members

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:45.819
of that group are continuing their Bible study with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:07:45.819 --> 00:07:52.660
Even in our current circumstances, we've been able to reach wide audiences through teleconferencing

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.579
and broadcasting.

00:07:54.579 --> 00:07:59.620
Some regions of Africa, without suitable internet, have been able to use television and radio

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:05.740
to broadcast not only the memorial, but their regular congregation meetings.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:12.259
After one broadcast, a non-witness man in Malawi said,

00:08:12.259 --> 00:08:17.339
the coronavirus has helped me to hear God's word explained effectively.

00:08:17.339 --> 00:08:21.980
In a way, I have never heard before my whole life.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:26.540
I had no idea that witnesses could teach so skillfully.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:31.420
I don't want to miss any of these meetings ever.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:35.460
And his comments were typical of many that were received at the branch office.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:36.740
Isn't that beautiful?

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:44.899
There are still places on this earth where the interest in Bible truth is great.

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:51.500
Or places with vast, unassigned territories, or where travel is difficult, or where other

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.659
conditions restrict our movement.

00:08:54.659 --> 00:09:02.460
If we're persecuted in one city, we flee to the next one, because this is a harvest.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:08.139
The grain is ripe, the time is limited, every worker is needed.

00:09:08.139 --> 00:09:16.580
And yet, unlike a literal harvest, where we can sort of size up the amount of work yet

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:22.220
to be done by the remainder of crop that has yet to be gathered, we can't do that and

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:23.740
say, we've got this.

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:28.899
We already know that we will be working right up to the end.

00:09:28.899 --> 00:09:34.419
But as Jesus assures us at Matthew chapter 10 and verse 22,

00:09:34.419 --> 00:09:40.179
the one who has endured to the end will be saved.
