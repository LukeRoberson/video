00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.429
You know, young people are very precious in the eyes of Jehovah.

00:00:06.429 --> 00:00:08.990
He loves them dearly.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.310
And we see that in the how Jesus himself viewed children when Jesus was on the earth.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.990
He welcomed them into his company.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.469
He blessed them.

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:19.710
This is because he imitated his father, Jehovah.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.589
Now, Jehovah holds them very precious because he sees the potential that they have of bringing

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:29.750
him praise and glory.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.869
And the way Jehovah created man to grow up and to experience youth during youth is a

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:43.909
very special time because it's a beautiful time of renewed energy or of new found energy

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:44.909
and strength.

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:51.789
In fact, the Bible says that Proverbs 20 verse 29, that the glory of young men is their

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:52.789
strength.

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:58.789
And it's such a beautiful thing when this strength is used to serve Jehovah God and to

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.670
praise him.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.909
What better way really could any of us experience Jehovah's blessing but to use whatever vital

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:14.189
energy we have, especially during our youthful energy time, to praise and serve our God, Jehovah.

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.109
And then we see how Jehovah works with us and blesses us, which encourages us to do even

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:21.870
greater works as we get older.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.390
This was the case when we consider King David.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.750
You know, when he was just a youth, he served as a shepherd.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.950
Guarding the flocks of his father.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.469
And what happened during that youthful time?

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:37.590
He used his energy to protect the flock.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.709
He even was able to strike down bears and lions who would eat the flock of his father.

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:49.629
But these instances of where he saw his own strength, but more importantly, when he saw

00:01:49.629 --> 00:01:56.310
Jehovah working with him, really encouraged him to have confidence to praise Jehovah as

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:03.469
he even grew older and to face any obstacle or any challenge that he may encounter.

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:10.270
He immediately saw this when, for instance, when Goliath taunted the battle lines of Jehovah.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.750
How did these experiences as a shepherd of his father's flock encourage him to take

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.990
on this challenge?

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:24.419
Well, if you have your Bible's handy, open it to 1 Samuel chapter 17.

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:32.300
And if we read verses 36 and 37, it says, David said, you're servant struck down both

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:39.139
lion and the bear and this uncircumcised Philistine will become like one of them, where he has

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:41.340
taunted the battle lines of the living God.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.020
He says, then David added, Jehovah who rescued me from the claws of the lion and the bear,

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.180
he is the one who will rescue me from the hand of the Philistine.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.460
So he had confidence in Jehovah and provided he would praise Jehovah and use whatever

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.180
energy he had and ability he had to serving God and to praising him.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.939
He knew Jehovah would back him up.

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:11.340
And so it was obvious when he slew Goliath who was behind this.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.740
It certainly wasn't just him because we remember when the Goliath looked down at David,

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.740
he sneered at him.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.620
He saw a handsome and ruddy boy.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:29.539
This little boyish-faced young man, red-haired and thought, with no spear, no armament, you

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:31.620
got to be kidding me.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:40.500
But here, Jehovah, because David praised him, backed David up and he gave David the victory.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.699
We see throughout the scriptures how youth were able to do this and putting whatever energy

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:47.900
they had and praising God, how Jehovah backed them up.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.740
We think of even the little Israelite girl who was taken captive by this Syrian naman.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.500
This poor little thing, she was kidnapped, probably scared, instead of recoiling, she looked

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.340
for opportunities to praise Jehovah God and what took place.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.300
Well we know that Jehovah blessed her efforts.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.539
He actually conquered the warrior naman and because of this little girl's boldness and

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:21.819
courage to praise Jehovah before him, naman became a worshiper of Jehovah God.

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:28.779
We can see then that it takes courage and strength, but it does not take a huge amount of

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:34.660
strength physically to accomplish Jehovah's will because he backs us up.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:41.139
We just need to put ourselves out there, like David and this young girl who, the Israelite

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.259
girl, praising Jehovah God and Jehovah will bless us.

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:51.300
Even in our modern day, we see little ones praising Jehovah God and doing tremendous work.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.139
Just this week, I heard an experience at our table of a young brother in a congregation

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:58.180
here in New York City.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.699
He was so bound and determined to praise Jehovah.

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:06.300
He had his presentation all prepared and he went to go and tell people about Jehovah.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.540
He went into a store with his brother that he was working with.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.939
Her owner wouldn't hear him, but as he was walking out the door, a man, a very large man

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:17.699
was walking through the door and he would not let the man pass.

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.819
He was bound and determined to give his presentation.

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:27.579
He looked at the man and he says, do you know why I am called one of Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:32.379
And the man says, well, I guess you're just following some man named Jehovah and he goes,

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:37.060
well, let me tell you from the scriptures why we are called Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:41.860
He gave his beautiful witness placed magazines with this man and the brother was working with him,

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.459
thanked him for listening to the young brother and the man says, no.

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:48.579
He says, I really appreciate what this young man had to say.

00:05:48.579 --> 00:05:52.579
He did a fine job in making a presentation.

00:05:52.579 --> 00:05:57.939
Yes, praising Jehovah God, just this little six-year-old and the brother told me,

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:03.060
he says, if you were to see this man, you would think twice about approaching him.

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:07.139
But this little brother had the courage and strength to praise Jehovah

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:10.500
and Jehovah richly blessed him for doing so.

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:18.339
Yes, we can see how Jehovah does bless us and how he has blessed our young people.

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:22.899
We see how wonderful they praise Jehovah God when they come to Bethel.

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:27.699
As was our commenter brought out this morning how we see how these young brothers and sisters

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:33.300
when they come to offer themselves here at Bethel to work hard, to praising Jehovah,

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:38.740
how he is able to bless his organization because of their hard work.

00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:44.819
And what a wonderful pattern of life this sets up for young ones and praising Jehovah God when

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:50.339
they are young. We know right here at Bethel when we praise Jehovah God by means of our work,

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:55.459
one day turns in the next years past and next thing you know, we've been serving Jehovah

00:06:55.459 --> 00:07:00.819
and we're still youthful in our minds and our hearts, but something can happen,

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:07.939
something that perhaps is surprising and confusing to us, that one day we wake up and we have

00:07:07.939 --> 00:07:15.060
that little pain in our back, we may get a little more tired than we used to, and yes, our physical

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:23.220
energy, our youthful energy has begun to weigh. Now, what do we do? Do we just toss in the

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:29.459
towel and call it defeat and say, well, forget it, let someone else do it? Well, remember what

00:07:29.459 --> 00:07:38.149
Jehovah says he would do for us at Isaiah chapter 40, in verse 31. Here we have this promise from

00:07:38.149 --> 00:07:45.589
Jehovah. He says, with those hoping in Jehovah will regain power. They will soar on wings like

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:54.790
eagles. They will run and not grow weary. They will walk and not tire out. Even though the physical

00:07:54.790 --> 00:08:01.589
body may tire out, the heart, the spirit, the courage, the zeal we have for Jehovah's service

00:08:01.589 --> 00:08:10.310
does not wane. We think of again, King David, when he got older. There he was in 2 Samuel chapter 21,

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:16.870
doing battle, doing battle again with giants, but the Bible says that he became exhausted.

00:08:18.149 --> 00:08:24.870
What happened? Well, others took up the slack. They went and fought for him. They fought the giants,

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:29.589
but no doubt they were encouraged by David's zeal and the encouragement he gave them and all the

00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:35.590
experiences that he related to them about Jehovah brought about victory during his youthful years.

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:41.750
Yes, David's heart never did weaken. His spirit was strong right until the end.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:49.909
Therefore, let us, if we're in our youthful ears, use our energy to praise Jehovah God. He will bless

00:08:49.909 --> 00:08:55.909
us and accomplish many mighty things in our, in his behalf, in using us. And likewise, those of us

00:08:55.909 --> 00:09:01.509
who are now getting older, we too can have that youthful zeal in praising our God and see how he's

00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:11.509
continues to work with us to accomplish great acts to his glory.
