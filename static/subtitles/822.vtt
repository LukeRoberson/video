WEBVTT

00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:08.220
Jehovah provides all of the things we need to accomplish our ministry and to feel secure

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.900
no matter what tribulation we face.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.420
We truly have experienced Jehovah's loving support during this pandemic.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.820
Our Heavenly Father, through his organization, has provided just what we've needed to endure

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.019
faithfully in our ministry and to stay strong spiritually.

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:35.340
How has the direction to shelter in place affected circuit overseers, construction servants,

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.179
field missionaries, and special pioneers?

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:43.740
How have they been able to continue in their ministry, serving Jehovah whole soul and

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.780
with joy?

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.929
What practical lessons have they learned?

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:54.409
To follow the governing body's direction to shelter in place, we couldn't go in to

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:56.729
see Steve's mother.

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:02.329
She was in aged care just 10 minutes away from where we're based.

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.209
She died whilst we were sheltering in place.

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:12.129
This led to another challenge, grieving in isolation.

00:01:12.129 --> 00:01:17.489
At the beginning of the shelter in place direction, I had a very difficult time.

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:23.650
I had flashbacks that were very difficult for me.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:31.569
During the Vietnam War, I was imprisoned because of taking a neutral stand.

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:38.250
I had a reaction to this lockdown of being confined.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.450
Fear of isolation is the biggest challenge for me.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:51.450
My lovely husband that I've been working with for years, helping those places of worship

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:59.489
for Jehovah was diagnosed with cancer and died for five months.

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:04.609
We especially discerned the value of the direction in November 2020.

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:10.449
When suddenly, I was taken to the hospital because of a serious heart disease and severe

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:11.969
pneumonia.

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:15.449
It turned out that my life was in danger.

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:21.409
The doctors evaluated that if I had contracted the coronavirus in that condition, I would

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:24.810
not have had a chance to survive it.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.409
While sheltering in place, how did these obedient brothers and sisters stay positive and

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:34.969
maintain their physical, emotional and spiritual health?

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:42.289
Even through this, even through the difficult time, having Zoom meetings, having the meetings

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:48.490
for field service, doing witnessing by Zoom, being with the brothers and sisters, I can't

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:55.849
say enough good about it, being able to not meet an hour requirement, but go ahead and

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.969
be very busy spiritually.

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:03.810
And so we did a phenomenal amount of shepherding, strengthening, upbuilding, our brothers and

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.050
sisters, folks literally from around the world that we knew needed help.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:15.930
In the governing body, we removed the specific hour requirement.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.490
I felt, I think we felt, their trust.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:29.610
That gave us more flexibility, and this enabled us to reach out to relatives not in the truth

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.969
and to support them during the pandemic, and that has led to regular, continuing Bible

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:38.969
studies.

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:43.449
I really feel how much the governing body cares for us.

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:47.770
Every time they mention in their letters, that they do not require us to reach the required

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.050
hours.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.849
Many brothers and sisters today are depressed and experiencing pandemic fatigue.

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.569
Usually, they need someone who they can talk to about their problems.

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.370
And because of these adjustments, I now have more time to encourage them and help them

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:11.569
to remain spiritually strong.

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:18.889
One sister and I decided to take two hours every day to engage in phone weight nursing

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:24.730
for the first time, even though we didn't know how to go about it.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.089
The second to receive, they said, taught me how to talk about the phone and how to help

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:34.050
people I find and to keep their interest.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.329
Since most congregations I served don't have internet access, I make video recordings

00:04:41.329 --> 00:04:44.410
for all talks.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:50.370
I make a simple platform and set up the microphone and cell phone I used to create the video.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:56.069
Then I stand in front and start giving the talk.

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:59.910
What blessings did they receive from their obedience?

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:05.949
I was so happy to start a Bible study during the pandemic, especially when I saw how quickly

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:09.470
the student was making progress.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.470
Because of my health, each study session was about 15 to 20 minutes long.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:21.029
I had to find a good place to conduct the study at the hospital, mainly in the hallway.

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:26.990
One day after the concluding prayer, I noticed the door to a doctor's office was open.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.269
The doctor was listening to our whole Bible study discussion.

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:36.100
I was so happy she attended the study as well.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.459
I am studying with sex of my relatives from the extended family who previously opposed

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:43.100
their good needs.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.980
One of them also told me of the husband noticing they're changing her in the way she treats

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.220
and talks to her.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:57.259
And as a result, the husband and four of the children are also learning the truth.

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:02.379
This from Jehovah has really kept me going.

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:09.899
Recently in my circuit, 59 Bible students progressed to baptism.

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:13.500
Unity within families is another blessing.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:22.420
Parents are spending a lot of time conducting Bible studies with their children.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:28.300
Our Christian life is compared to a race, and this is not a short race.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.920
There are unexpected things that can happen to us.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:40.560
By striving to obey from the heart now, we can be prepared to obey the directions that

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.779
we are going to receive in the great tribulation.

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:50.980
We are sure this is not the last time we have to be obedient.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:56.180
We see Bible prophecies being fulfilled right in front of our eyes, and ahead of us are

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.259
even greater events that will bring larger trials.

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:07.019
James, chapter 1, verses 2 and 3, helps us despite trials to keep joy, deep joy in our

00:07:07.019 --> 00:07:13.740
hearts, and it ensures us that all difficult situations will help us to work on endurance,

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:19.550
and this quality will help to cope with trials to come.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:24.750
I personally have benefited from following the governing body's direction.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:32.230
I've actually felt joy every day, and I can only put that down to the blessing from

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:37.029
Jehovah God on our efforts to be obedient.

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:43.189
We both benefited from the direction from the governing body, because we trust.

00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:48.069
They are the faithful and discrete slave Christ Jesus is directing them.

00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:57.629
I am so absolutely grateful to the governing body for providing direction that is blessing

00:07:57.629 --> 00:08:02.269
every single one of us around the earth.

00:08:02.269 --> 00:08:08.670
Just like you, these dear ones have made great sacrifices to continue serving Jehovah whole

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:14.069
soul during this pandemic, and no doubt we've all learned the value of applying the words

00:08:14.069 --> 00:08:21.310
as a second Timothy, chapter 4, verse 2, preach the word, be edit urgently in favourable

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:25.350
times and difficult times.

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:31.350
For a certainty, neither this pandemic nor any other difficult times to come will stop

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:38.149
our preaching work, and more importantly, prevent Jehovah's loving care.
