00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:07.440
Annual meetings of the Watchtower Bible and Track Society of Pennsylvania have been held

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.279
for many years, in fact, since January 1885.

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:20.000
They have been held in different states in the U.S. and in 1983 in Britain.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.120
This year, 2020, the corporate meeting is being held by video conference.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.679
The spiritual program has been recorded for the benefit of the brothers all over the

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:36.600
Earth. This is a historic annual meeting.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.000
In the past, we have had some historic annual meetings.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.520
For example, at the annual meeting held on October 2, 1944 in Pittsburgh, the members of

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.759
the Pennsylvania Corporation adopted six resolutions amending its charter.

00:00:54.759 --> 00:01:00.439
The charter had provided that voting shares be issued to contributors of funds to the

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:06.799
Society's work, but the Third Amendment eliminated that provision.

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:13.079
Thereafter, the reactors of the Society were to be voted into office by individuals who

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:19.840
were fully devoted to Jehovah, irrespective of the amount of money that they contributed

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.640
to advance the Kingdom work.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:31.200
After the historic annual meeting in 1944, a vital question remained.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.319
Since the governing body was then closely identified with the Pennsylvania Corporations

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:43.219
Seven Member Board of Directors, did this mean that the governing body could never be

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:48.519
made up of more than seven anointed Christians?

00:01:48.519 --> 00:01:54.920
Moreover, since the directors are elected by the members of the corporation, where the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:02.819
corporation members electing members of the governing body at the annual meeting each year,

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:09.080
are the directors and officers of the Watchtower Bible and Track Society of Pennsylvania and

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:16.000
the members of the governing body one and the same, or are they different?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.199
These questions were answered years later.

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:26.819
They were answered at the annual meeting held on October 1, 1971, another historic annual

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.919
meeting.

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:35.379
On that occasion, one of the speakers pointed out that the governing body preceded the

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:42.439
Watchtower Bible and Track Society of Pennsylvania by hundreds of years.

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:48.080
Now, contract to some who opposed Jehovah and the earthly part of his organization and

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.120
claim there was no governing body in the first century, and hence they see no need for

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.039
a governing body today.

00:02:55.039 --> 00:03:03.280
A governing body was formed at Pentecost of 33 CE, more than 18 centuries before the Pennsylvania

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.520
Corporation came into existence.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.240
The first, the governing body consisted of 12 apostles.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.319
Its number was enlarged later for the apostles and older men in Jerusalem were taking the

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:19.319
lead.

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:28.479
Now, notice what happened later here in the Bible book of Acts in chapter 15.

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:34.400
So other issues had been handled by the 12 apostles, but now with this circumcision

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.840
issue that came up amongst the congregations.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.560
Notice what we read here in verse 2 of Acts 15, but after quite a bit of dissension and

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:52.800
disputing by Paul and Barnabas with them, it was arranged for Paul, Barnabas, and some

00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:02.439
of the others to go up to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem regarding this issue.

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:06.879
So the issue was going to be settled by the first century governing body.

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.840
And now it's larger than the apostles.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.040
It included the elders and the apostles in Jerusalem.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.720
Now what is the benefit of following the direction from the governing body in the first

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.720
century?

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:30.879
And by extension today, notice in Acts 16, verse 4 and 5, they're carrying the decree

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:35.439
there, and it mentions as they traveled on through the cities, they would deliver to

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:41.160
them for observation, observance, excuse me, the decrees that had been decided on by the

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.360
apostles and the elders who were in Jerusalem.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:52.800
Now notice, then indeed, the congregations continued to be made firm in the faith and

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.800
to increase in number day by day.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:04.360
That beautiful, there was a governing body, they didn't have a need for legal entities

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:13.720
to advance the kingdom work in the first century, but they did indeed need a governing body.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:20.560
As long as conditions in this world permit, the governing body will make use of legal entities.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:28.519
If a legal entity is dissolved by a government decree, the preaching work will still go on.

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:34.639
Even now, in lands where restrictions are in effect and no legal entities are used, the

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:43.519
kingdom message is being proclaimed, disciples are being made, and theocracy's increase continues.

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:48.759
In the midst of this pandemic, the preaching continues.

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:51.720
Many experiences are happening globally.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.160
Now one I received and confirmed from two elders serving at Warwick Bethel, I think you'll

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:04.160
appreciate so much going on and so many nice experiences with a healthcare system that

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:11.199
operates dozens of hospitals across the United States, and many of them were COVID hotspots.

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:17.199
They wanted to publish a video interview featuring two frontline healthcare workers in

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:18.839
one of the hospitals.

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:25.279
Well, it happened that the two nurses they chose were the interviews where our brothers.

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:28.600
They were asked to supply pictures of the family.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.319
One of the pictures had been taken before the pandemic in front of a paradise scene in

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:35.480
one of our assembly halls.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.480
Now the woman coordinating the video interviews told the brother that she recognized that

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.759
scene.

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:46.040
So he asked her if she was a witness.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:51.839
She replied, no, but I studied with the witnesses and I know it's the truth.

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:56.000
I can see how close we are to the end.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.079
The brother then told her that be happy to know that the second nurse whom she had interviewed

00:07:02.079 --> 00:07:10.720
the day before was also a witness, then the woman burst into tears.

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:18.439
She said it made sense that the two nurses selected for this interview would both be witnesses.

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:24.240
I can see it in your approach and the belief in something bigger than this.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.879
And she said she planned to resume her Bible studies.

00:07:27.879 --> 00:07:33.839
We pray for this woman and all the wonderful experiences happening as the preaching goes

00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:36.839
on during this pandemic.

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:43.839
So this is all happening because Jehovah's Witnesses plant and water and God keeps making

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:45.720
it grow.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.639
All glory goes to Jehovah.

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:56.240
At this meeting, as was pointed out last year with the announcement about the Ramapo project,

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.680
you will learn that the faithful slave is not slowing down.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:08.279
We have more work to do until Jehovah says the preaching work is finished.

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:12.839
As we look to the future, we are confident that Jehovah will care for the spiritual and

00:08:12.839 --> 00:08:15.199
material needs of his people.

00:08:15.199 --> 00:08:20.279
He and his son Jesus Christ will continue to provide the heavenly direction and support

00:08:20.279 --> 00:08:24.360
needed to complete the kingdom preaching work.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:29.800
We therefore beg Jehovah for his spirit to finish the work he has given us.
