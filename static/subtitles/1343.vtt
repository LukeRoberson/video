In Japan, we noticed that we weren't really reaching the younger generation in our field ministry.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.399
However, Tokyo is a place where many come for work and to go to school.

00:00:18.399 --> 00:00:27.829
So the Japan branch planned a special preaching campaign for the Tokyo City Area.

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:34.829
More than 26,000 publishers applied for this campaign, this was a nice surprise.

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:42.829
The publishers were given personal territories, so they could be flexible in deciding when it would be most effective to reach people.

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:50.829
I realised that city people were out and about an evening, so I decided to try to start witnessing at 7pm.

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:59.829
We reached people living in high security apartment buildings through informal witnessing, and some even accepted Bible studies.

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:08.829
We were amazed when we learned that 2,389 Bible studies had been started in just four weeks.

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:16.829
Thanks to this campaign, I now know that there are still many here in my territory who would agree to a Bible study.

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:19.829
It was wonderful.

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:28.829
You could see Jehovah's rich blessing on the brothers and sisters, who stepped out of their comfort zone to try to meet as many as they could.

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:38.829
You could see Jehovah's rich blessing on the brothers and sisters, who stepped out of their comfort zone to try to meet as many as they could.

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:47.829
You could see Jehovah's rich blessing on the brothers and sisters, who stepped out of their comfort zone to try to meet as many as they could.
