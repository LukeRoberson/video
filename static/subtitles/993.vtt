WEBVTT

00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:08.169
Earlier, we considered the expression at Philippians 4.7, the peace of God that surpasses all

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:10.169
understanding.

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:15.410
That is, the tranquility and calmness we enjoy because we have a close friendship with

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.170
Jehovah.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.850
What a remarkable blessing.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:26.769
But although we enjoy God-given peace, our life in this system of things is not problem-free,

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:27.769
is it?

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:33.329
No, I'm 34 and 19, it acknowledges as much when it says, many are the hardships of the

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.530
righteous one.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.409
But Jehovah rescues him from them all.

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:48.329
We may experience family opposition, persecution, war, natural disasters, or severe illnesses.

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.890
But none of these hardships can separate us from God's love.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.210
Neither death nor life, nor angels, nor governments, nor things now here, nor things

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.210
to come.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.969
None of these things can rob us of the peace Jehovah gives.

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.650
And yet there is something that can.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:14.090
Please turn with me to Isaiah chapter 32, verse 17.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.489
And as we read this text, notice that it refers to peace as a result.

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:23.209
Do you think of peace that way as a result?

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:28.090
If peace is a result, what causes it?

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.890
Isaiah 32, 17.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.849
The result of true righteousness will be peace.

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:47.129
And the fruitage of true righteousness will be lasting tranquility and security.

00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:54.250
What a beautiful expression, lasting tranquility and security.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.890
Again, from what does it result?

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:58.890
True righteousness.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.849
What if righteousness no longer mattered to us?

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:06.250
What if a person concluded it makes no difference how I live or what sacrifices I make?

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.610
If I'm going to suffer hardships either way, I might as well do whatever I please while

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.650
I can?

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.969
What's wrong with that thinking?

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:21.729
Let it show appreciation for peace and all that Jehovah has done to make it possible.

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:23.889
Peace is a result.

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:27.210
And behind every result is a cause.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.689
If we want peace, we have to pursue righteousness.

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:36.050
An unrighteous person cannot be at peace with God.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.449
Serious transgressions put a strain on a person's relationship with God.

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:49.449
All King David's words found at Psalm 38-3, sensing Jehovah's disapproval, he wrote,

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:57.289
"...there is no peace within my bones because of my sin.

00:02:57.289 --> 00:03:05.210
Inevitably the unrighteous person will reap what he sowed and lose his peace."

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.330
What is righteousness?

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.169
And how do we pursue it?

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.530
It's righteousness is what we have or what we show when we do what is right according

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.330
to Jehovah's standards.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.490
And those standards are not just rules we follow, but principles that guide the way we deal

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.569
with each other.

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.930
As universal sovereign and creator, Jehovah God determines what is righteous.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.289
Isn't that what was represented by the tree of the knowledge of good and bad in the

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:33.810
Garden of Eden?

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.650
As a result of Jehovah's command to abstain from its fruit, that tree represented God's

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.770
right to determine for his creatures what is good and what is bad for them.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:51.009
And although Jehovah has given humans free will, the right to choose, he has not granted

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:56.409
humans, not even perfect ones, the right to set the standard for what is righteous and

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:58.210
what is not.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:07.490
Now notice once again that Isaiah 32-17 says that the result of true righteousness will

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:08.490
be peace.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:16.610
That term, twice, true righteousness, not everything called righteousness is true righteousness.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:22.610
Many people view righteousness as just a personal virtue achieved by following the rules.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:29.850
At Matthew 23-28, Jesus said that the Pharisees appeared righteous on the outside, but inside

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.170
they were lawless.

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:38.050
Ecclesiastes 7-16 talks about those who think their standards are more righteous even

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.290
than gods.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:48.170
And at Romans 10-3 Paul talked about people who seek to establish their own righteousness.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:58.170
But false piety, overrighteousness and self-righteousness are not what Isaiah 32-17 is talking about.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:04.449
Today many argue for the acceptance of conduct that Jehovah forbids.

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:10.329
They may even find support from a world already alienated from God.

00:05:10.329 --> 00:05:16.129
But wide acceptance in a growing community does not redefine righteousness.

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:19.529
None of that is true righteousness.

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:25.129
Our loving creator sets the standard for what is right, not our feelings, not the community

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:26.930
at large.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.329
Now while you're here in Isaiah, please turn to chapter 48.

00:05:32.329 --> 00:05:40.050
In order to be viewed as righteous, we have to trust that Jehovah should set the standard

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.649
of right and wrong.

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:47.129
In addition, we must prove by our speech and actions that we agree with Jehovah's standards

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:48.930
and obey him.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.050
And that takes real courage in a wicked world.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.129
But when we do that, we enjoy the result.

00:05:56.129 --> 00:06:03.050
Here's what it says at Isaiah, chapter 48, verses 17 and 18.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.649
This is what Jehovah says.

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:13.689
You are repurchaser, the holy one of Israel, I Jehovah am your God.

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:18.610
The one teaching you to benefit yourself, or as the footnote says, teaching you for your

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.689
own good.

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:25.089
The one guiding you in the way you should walk.

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:33.689
If only you would pay attention to my commandments, then your peace would become just like a river

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:39.689
and your righteousness like the waves of the sea.

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:43.490
Paying attention to Jehovah's commandments results in two things.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:52.730
First, our peace will become just like a river, serene, abundant, ongoing.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:58.250
Second, our righteousness will be like the waves of the sea.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.649
Remember your last trip to the beach?

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:05.009
As you stood there on the shore, perhaps on a high hill overlooking the ocean, watching

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:11.209
the waves roll in one after the other, just as they have for thousands of years, could

00:07:11.209 --> 00:07:14.730
you feel a sense of constancy?

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:19.649
Jehovah says that our course of doing what is right can be just like that.

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:22.250
He will guide us in the path of righteousness.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.689
He will bless us with unending peace.

00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:33.329
In the process, we learn through experience how Jehovah's wise and loving ways truly

00:07:33.329 --> 00:07:35.250
benefit us personally.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:40.689
But if we refuse to do that, we learn what agitation and discord truly mean.

00:07:40.689 --> 00:07:49.170
As verse 22 says, there is no peace, says Jehovah, for the wicked.

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:53.089
It's not a heavy-handed threat to manipulate human behavior as if Jehovah needed to do

00:07:53.089 --> 00:07:54.089
that.

00:07:54.089 --> 00:07:58.649
It's a fact, a truth, a timeless principle.

00:07:58.649 --> 00:08:00.170
God is love.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:07.689
He teaches us for our own good, and the result, if we pay attention, is peace.

00:08:07.689 --> 00:08:12.009
Isaiah 48, 17, and 18.

00:08:12.009 --> 00:08:18.850
And these verses assure us that imperfect humans truly can have a righteous standing

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.850
with God.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:23.170
Let's explore that further.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:30.209
Do you recall the very first time the word righteous is used in the Bible?

00:08:30.209 --> 00:08:32.929
Turn with me, please, to Genesis 6.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:38.409
Now you likely recognize this as the account about Noah, a Noah lived in an extremely wicked

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:39.690
world.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:44.570
During his lifetime, rebel angels left their assignments in heaven, materialized, married

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:49.289
human women, and fathered hybrid offspring who became violent giants.

00:08:49.289 --> 00:08:55.450
Now, how did all of that wickedness and violence affect Jehovah?

00:08:55.450 --> 00:09:02.850
According to Genesis 6, 6, his heart was saddened, which is a remarkable thing to contemplate,

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:03.850
isn't it?

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:10.570
Jehovah's feelings are affected by our decisions because he cares for us.

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:17.129
That ancient world became so wicked that Jehovah decided it must be destroyed.

00:09:17.129 --> 00:09:23.210
And yet right in the midst of all this depravity, Noah showed a different spirit.

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:29.690
Notice what it says at Genesis 6 verses 8 and 9.

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:34.970
But Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:38.570
This is the history of Noah.

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:47.889
Noah was a righteous man, there it is, and why was he described as righteous?

00:09:47.889 --> 00:09:52.809
He proved himself faultless among his contemporaries.

00:09:52.809 --> 00:09:59.529
Yes, Noah was not like the rebel angels or their offspring or like degraded human society.

00:09:59.529 --> 00:10:04.049
Noah walked with the true God.

00:10:04.049 --> 00:10:12.370
And thus the second time we find the word righteous is at Genesis 7 and verse 1.

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:17.889
After that Jehovah said to Noah, go into the ark, you and all your household because

00:10:17.889 --> 00:10:28.129
you are the one I have found to be righteous before me among this generation.

00:10:28.129 --> 00:10:33.450
Because of Noah's righteousness, he and his family survived the flood.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:36.889
The worship Jehovah on a cleansed earth.

00:10:36.889 --> 00:10:44.370
And after the waters subsided, and the family emerged from the ark, they witnessed a splendid

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:54.929
sight, one never before observed a serene, multi-colored arch in the sky, a rainbow, a reassuring

00:10:54.929 --> 00:11:03.370
indication of peace with God, peace, resulting from righteousness.

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:08.769
And where does the word righteous appear next in the Bible?

00:11:08.769 --> 00:11:13.450
In the account about Abraham, notably in his famous conversation with Jehovah found

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:19.210
at Genesis chapter 18, where Jehovah promised Abraham that if he found as few as 10 righteous

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:23.889
people in the city of Sodom, he would not destroy that city.

00:11:23.889 --> 00:11:30.850
Now what was it that distinguished Abraham as righteous in that moral climate?

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:37.330
As you read Genesis chapter 12 through 22, you get the sense that Abraham was a man of great

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.009
faith, unwavering faith.

00:11:39.009 --> 00:11:42.529
He was ready to do whatever Jehovah asked of him.

00:11:42.529 --> 00:11:51.289
Now citing Genesis chapter 15 and verse 6 and other texts, James 223 says that Abraham

00:11:51.289 --> 00:11:59.690
put faith in Jehovah, and it was counted to him as righteousness.

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:11.289
And he came to be called Jehovah's Friend, Jehovah's Friend, peace with God, resulting

00:12:11.289 --> 00:12:12.289
from righteousness.

00:12:12.289 --> 00:12:15.450
Now what about God's people today?

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:27.090
In turn with me please to Isaiah chapter 60, Isaiah chapter 60, Jehovah refers to Noah

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:29.889
and Abraham as righteous.

00:12:29.889 --> 00:12:32.850
But what would he say about you and me?

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:41.210
Well, notice what it says toward the end of this chapter, Isaiah 60, verses 21,

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:51.090
and 22, and all your people will be righteous.

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:54.769
They will possess the land forever.

00:12:54.769 --> 00:13:00.370
They are the sprout that I planted, the work of my hands for me to be beautified, the

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:06.730
little one will become a thousand, and the small one a mighty nation I myself Jehovah

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:11.129
will speed it up in its own time.

00:13:11.129 --> 00:13:17.049
Just prospective members of the great crowd have been declared righteous as friends of

00:13:17.049 --> 00:13:19.529
God, as Abraham was.

00:13:19.529 --> 00:13:25.250
In Jehovah's eyes they are, as it says in Revelation chapter 7 and verse 9, dressed in white

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:26.250
robes.

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:33.330
Today, they are serving alongside God's spirit- anointed ones who were declared righteous for life.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:41.690
Jehovah, our repurchaser, the holy one of Israel has bought us back from bondage to sin

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:49.409
and death through the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ, and thus with faith in the ransom

00:13:49.409 --> 00:13:56.529
sacrifice of Jesus Christ, imperfect people are considered righteous in the sight of God.

00:13:56.529 --> 00:14:01.889
Now in calling us righteous, Jehovah God by means of Jesus has done something for us

00:14:01.889 --> 00:14:07.250
that we could not do for ourselves in our imperfect condition, but does that mean that

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.090
we can do no wrong?

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:13.929
No, it does not mean that.

00:14:13.929 --> 00:14:21.330
In order to maintain our peace, we must cooperate with Jehovah.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:25.330
Turn with me please to Romans chapter 1.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:31.210
Now it like Noah and Abraham, we live in a wicked and violent world where we are exposed

00:14:31.289 --> 00:14:37.889
to a spirit of disobedience, Satan wants us to become part of this world by adopting

00:14:37.889 --> 00:14:41.090
its unrighteous standards.

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:47.009
In the world, sexual immorality is practiced without shame, homosexuals flaunt their conduct,

00:14:47.009 --> 00:14:53.169
but Jehovah tells us that homosexual acts are unrighteous.

00:14:53.169 --> 00:15:00.210
God specifically warned the Israelites against this and other forms of immorality.

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:09.009
Leviticus chapter 18 and verse 22 says that homosexual acts are detestable.

00:15:09.009 --> 00:15:11.450
Does Jehovah still find it so offensive?

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:17.169
Well, notice what he inspired for both Jews and non-Jews in the Christian Greek Scriptures

00:15:17.169 --> 00:15:23.970
here at Romans chapter 1 verses 26 and 27.

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:30.769
That is why God gave them over to disgraceful sexual passion.

00:15:30.769 --> 00:15:36.370
For their females changed to the natural use of themselves into one contrary to nature.

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:41.889
Likewise also the males left the natural use of the female and became violently inflamed

00:15:41.889 --> 00:15:48.090
in their lust toward one another, males with males, working with his obscene and receiving

00:15:48.169 --> 00:15:54.009
in themselves the full penalty which was due for their error.

00:15:54.009 --> 00:15:57.769
So Jehovah has not changed.

00:15:57.769 --> 00:16:07.250
According to the Creator, homosexual acts constitute disgraceful obscene error.

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:08.970
Some would disagree.

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:16.809
As verse 28 points out, such ones do not consider it worthwhile to acknowledge God, but with

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:18.490
what result?

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:25.370
As it says there, a disapproved mental state, just the opposite of peace.

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:29.769
And merely approving of unrighteous conduct, displeases Jehovah.

00:16:29.769 --> 00:16:33.850
Notice how this is indicated in verse 32.

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:39.649
Although these know full well the righteous decree of God that those practicing such things

00:16:39.649 --> 00:16:46.690
are deserving of death, they not only keep on doing them, but also approve of those

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:49.009
practicing them.

00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:56.009
Still, we do not hate individuals who practice unrighteousness, nor do we judge them.

00:16:56.009 --> 00:16:58.169
On the contrary, we share the good news with them.

00:16:58.169 --> 00:17:04.009
We remember that we were all born with the same infirmities and have the same sinful tendencies,

00:17:04.009 --> 00:17:08.529
but we also have the same inherent spiritual need.

00:17:08.529 --> 00:17:13.049
And thus we recognize that others can have the same peace, the same privileges, and the

00:17:13.049 --> 00:17:16.329
same prospects we enjoy, if.

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:19.609
They pay attention to Jehovah.

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:25.170
First Timothy 2, 3, and 4 says that God's will is that all sorts of people should be saved

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.130
and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:32.210
And people practicing all manner of unrighteousness have accepted the truth.

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:36.210
That is what some of you were, 1 Corinthians 6, 11 says.

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:42.529
So we communicate impartially with all our neighbors, but we hate unrighteous conduct.

00:17:42.529 --> 00:17:47.650
And we refuse to compromise Bible principles.

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:52.210
Now sometimes moral issues become the center of heated political debates.

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:55.529
We avoid getting drawn into such controversies.

00:17:55.529 --> 00:18:00.809
But now, in practical terms, what might that look like?

00:18:00.809 --> 00:18:06.170
In the following video, notice how adults can respond effectively when questioned on highly

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:07.970
controversial issues.

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:22.660
There you are.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.259
Did you both get the e-mail survey I sent?

00:18:25.259 --> 00:18:26.779
Did you both come, right?

00:18:26.779 --> 00:18:27.779
I must have missed it.

00:18:27.779 --> 00:18:28.779
I was on calls all morning.

00:18:28.779 --> 00:18:29.779
What's this about?

00:18:29.779 --> 00:18:31.779
The whole office is leaving early.

00:18:31.779 --> 00:18:38.019
We're going downtown to support the march for gay rights.

00:18:38.019 --> 00:18:39.420
She won't go.

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.420
Why?

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.059
It's against our religion.

00:18:43.059 --> 00:18:48.180
Some of her people came by my house, and when I asked, they said, your church will support

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:50.700
gay marriage.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:55.029
Irene?

00:18:55.309 --> 00:18:56.630
It's true.

00:18:56.630 --> 00:19:01.750
As Jehovah's Witnesses, we hold to the Bible standard on marriage, which is only between

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:04.069
a man and a woman.

00:19:04.069 --> 00:19:06.509
And we remain politically neutral.

00:19:06.509 --> 00:19:11.130
That's such ignorant thinking.

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:14.049
I understand it's a sensitive subject.

00:19:14.049 --> 00:19:18.049
I have a daughter who deserves her rights.

00:19:18.049 --> 00:19:19.970
Trust me, Amber.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:25.650
As one of Jehovah's Witnesses, we believe everyone has a right to choose how they live.

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:30.450
And I would never force my beliefs on anyone, but you won't go.

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:37.099
Just as I would never force my beliefs on you, all I ask is the same respect.

00:19:37.099 --> 00:19:38.819
And no, I won't be going.

00:19:38.819 --> 00:19:45.799
I have to go back to work.

00:19:45.799 --> 00:19:51.680
Look, obviously, Irene, I don't agree with your perspective.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:55.160
But I do appreciate that you're not pushing on anyone else.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:20:08.190
Thank you.

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:14.589
In contrast, with the majority of mankind who are divided, true Christians are united.

00:20:14.589 --> 00:20:17.589
We loyally support Jehovah's right to rule.

00:20:17.589 --> 00:20:21.390
We don't set the standards, and we're not trying to solve the world's problems on our

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:22.390
own.

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:25.150
We fully support God's kingdom.

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:30.349
As we observed in the video, moral and political issues might be brought up in the workplace.

00:20:30.349 --> 00:20:37.109
But more often, our young ones, even very young ones, are confronted with these same topics.

00:20:37.109 --> 00:20:39.029
How will they respond?

00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:41.750
Are your young ones ready?

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:49.859
As you watch the next video, notice how Olivia defends Jehovah's Righteous Standards.

00:20:49.859 --> 00:20:51.859
Great discussion today, everyone.

00:20:51.859 --> 00:20:55.859
Remember, midterms of this Friday, no excuses.

00:20:55.859 --> 00:20:58.619
That includes you, Jordan.

00:20:58.619 --> 00:21:03.380
You were noticeably silent during our discussion today, Olivia.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:04.380
I was.

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:07.220
I guess I just didn't have much to say.

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:10.900
Are you concerned about gay rights?

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:18.700
Um, well, it seems like a political issue, and I say neutral when it comes political stuff.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.339
But it's not a political issue.

00:21:20.339 --> 00:21:23.140
This is a human rights issue.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.980
Mr. Dallas, she's like crazy religious.

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.779
Hey, there's nothing wrong with it.

00:21:27.779 --> 00:21:28.779
No, you don't understand.

00:21:28.779 --> 00:21:31.779
Jehovah's Witnesses hate everybody that is in straight.

00:21:31.779 --> 00:21:32.779
That's not true.

00:21:32.779 --> 00:21:33.779
We don't hate anyone.

00:21:34.019 --> 00:21:37.099
I've spoken with your people before.

00:21:37.099 --> 00:21:38.819
They seem big on equality.

00:21:38.819 --> 00:21:39.619
We are.

00:21:39.619 --> 00:21:46.299
The Bible says God isn't partial, so we believe that everyone should be treated fairly.

00:21:46.299 --> 00:21:48.299
Good.

00:21:48.299 --> 00:21:52.940
So I assume you have gay members in your church?

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:57.849
No, we don't.

00:21:57.849 --> 00:22:01.690
But I thought you just said everyone should be treated equal.

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:03.210
I'm confused.

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:04.930
Ah, call that.

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:09.049
Jordan, don't you have a class to get to?

00:22:09.049 --> 00:22:14.970
As I was saying, how is that not a little hypocritical?

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:26.569
Saying that you love everyone, and then excluding certain people?

00:22:26.569 --> 00:22:34.059
Honestly, Mr. Dallas, I've wondered the same thing.

00:22:34.059 --> 00:22:36.460
OK.

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:37.859
And?

00:22:37.859 --> 00:22:43.259
Well, I researched it in the Bible, and I realized that God accepts all people,

00:22:43.259 --> 00:22:47.829
but He doesn't accept all conduct.

00:22:47.829 --> 00:22:51.160
What does that mean?

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:57.079
It means that you can't be abusing drugs, you can't be stealing,

00:22:57.079 --> 00:23:01.720
or being violent, and still be a witness.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:09.119
There's just certain actions that God just doesn't accept.

00:23:09.119 --> 00:23:13.599
Including how someone expresses their sexuality?

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:17.559
In some cases, yes, we follow God's standards,

00:23:17.559 --> 00:23:21.359
not having sex without being married.

00:23:21.359 --> 00:23:27.069
Well, if that's how you feel, that's your right.

00:23:27.069 --> 00:23:30.150
Personally, it seems a tad archaic to me,

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:40.119
but to each their own.

00:23:40.119 --> 00:23:45.680
Hey, does the Bible really say all that?

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.720
Yeah, it does.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.400
OK, maybe you could show me some time.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:24:17.509
Yeah, for sure, awesome.

00:24:17.509 --> 00:24:22.069
So we can expect future installments in this saga.

00:24:22.069 --> 00:24:26.069
But did you notice how Olivia was able to defend Jehovah's Right

00:24:26.069 --> 00:24:27.549
to standards?

00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:30.230
She kept her peaceful spirit, didn't she?

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:32.869
She acknowledged that she had the same question as the teacher,

00:24:32.869 --> 00:24:35.829
but she had done further research on the subject.

00:24:35.829 --> 00:24:37.670
And did you appreciate how she subtly

00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:40.069
showed that Jehovah's standards benefit

00:24:40.069 --> 00:24:43.230
both the individual and the community?

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:46.309
As examples, she highlighted the avoidance of drug abuse

00:24:46.309 --> 00:24:46.910
and theft.

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:50.789
Values she knew her teacher would appreciate.

00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:56.109
Parents are your young ones able to explain why we do

00:24:56.109 --> 00:24:58.869
or don't do certain things.

00:24:58.869 --> 00:25:01.150
Do you know how your children really

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:03.670
feel about Jehovah's standards?

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:08.390
Are they obedient simply to avoid making you mad?

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:13.390
If so, will that truly be enough?

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:16.589
Encourage your young ones to prove to themselves

00:25:16.589 --> 00:25:19.150
why Jehovah's standards are wise.

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:22.269
Help them to see how they can explain their choice

00:25:22.269 --> 00:25:24.349
to live by Jehovah's standards.

00:25:24.349 --> 00:25:31.210
Teach them how to resist pressure to follow the world.

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:37.009
We are so thankful that even during these critical times,

00:25:37.009 --> 00:25:40.009
hard to deal with, we can enjoy the inner peace

00:25:40.009 --> 00:25:43.089
that Jehovah gives to the righteous.

00:25:43.089 --> 00:25:45.009
But let's remind ourselves of what

00:25:45.009 --> 00:25:49.690
Jehovah promises to bring about once Satan's unrighteous system

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:51.410
is removed.

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:56.250
Turn with me, please, to Psalm 37.

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:59.089
Here in these familiar verses, we find

00:25:59.089 --> 00:26:02.450
a beautiful description of what is to come.

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:05.289
And notice once again, how the Bible makes

00:26:05.289 --> 00:26:10.130
the correlation between peace and righteousness.

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:13.250
Psalm 37.29.

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:15.210
Do you have it?

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:17.609
What does it say?

00:26:17.609 --> 00:26:22.329
Who will possess the earth, the righteous,

00:26:22.329 --> 00:26:27.730
and for how long will they live on it, forever?

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:30.289
And then according to verse 11, what

00:26:30.289 --> 00:26:34.220
will they find there?

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.460
Peace.

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:39.140
The result of true righteousness will be peace.

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:42.099
And how much peace will they find a little peace,

00:26:42.099 --> 00:26:44.380
just personal or family peace?

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:46.380
Remember, the righteous already had peace with God,

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.420
even when wicked people still existed.

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:50.900
But what will Jehovah provide to all those who

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:53.740
continue loving him?

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:57.299
The abundance of peace.

00:26:57.299 --> 00:27:00.180
And how will you feel about that?

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:04.819
Delighted or exquisitely delighted?

00:27:04.819 --> 00:27:06.579
So stick with it, dear friends.

00:27:06.579 --> 00:27:09.660
During this convention, be on the lookout for the connection

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.099
between peace and righteousness.

00:27:12.099 --> 00:27:14.220
Continue on the course of righteousness.

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.819
Help others to find the way of peace.

00:27:16.819 --> 00:27:20.019
In that way, we can enjoy peace with Jehovah now,

00:27:20.019 --> 00:27:22.460
throughout the remainder of these last days,

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.900
and on into the future when Jesus rules

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:29.059
as king over a cleanser in which the righteous will flourish.

00:27:29.059 --> 00:27:31.500
And peace will abound.
