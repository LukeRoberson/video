00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.860
We don't know anything about Habakkuk's parents. We don't know anything about his circumstances in life, his death.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.980
We don't know anything about Habakkuk, but what we do know is that he lived during a most stressful time

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.219
during the nation of Israel's history. The year was 628 to BCE.

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:23.859
Wicked King Jehoya. Jehoya Kim was ruling the son of Josiah.

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:27.899
That would be about 20 years before 607.

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:35.700
And verse 2 describes the conditions that Habakkuk and Jeremiah and others had to face in verse 2.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.700
How long would Jehovah must I cry for help?

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.899
But you do not hear. How long must I ask for help from violence, but you do not intervene?

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:53.899
How stressful this must have been to Habakkuk. Jerusalem was no city of peace, rather a city of violence and bloodshed.

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:02.899
Verse 4. The wicked surrounds the righteous. The prophet Eirijah had to run away because of the wickedness. He was afraid.

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.900
He went down to Egypt. Jehoya Kim drags him back to Jerusalem and kills him.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.900
And then Jehoya Kim, he hated Jeremiah, had seething hatred for that prophet.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.900
He was a scary time to live in Jerusalem and Habakkuk had to do that. No wonder.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.900
No wonder he poured out his heart to Jehovah. Why, Jehovah? Why?

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.900
Why don't you do something? Jerusalem, this is the city you chose. Your temple is here.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.900
You had this temple built. The Davidic King is on the throne.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.900
This is your city, Jehovah. Why don't you do something?

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.900
And Jehovah said, Habakkuk, I am doing something.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.900
I am doing something. And he now goes on to show what he is doing. Yes, it is wicked times there.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.900
But he shows now in verse 5 and 6, even as brother Thomas said,

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.900
that Babylonians are coming. The Caldians are coming.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.900
And they are going to punish unfaithful Israelites, unfaithful ones.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.900
And then in chapter 2, Habakkuk, Jehovah shows Habakkuk that Babylon itself will not escape punishment.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.900
And it will be conquered by the Meads and the Persians in 539 BCE.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.900
So amidst all of those problems, Habakkuk, I have my eye on you, Jehovah saying,

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.900
and on Jeremiah and Daniel and Ezekiel, these faithful ones, they're not going to be lost in the crowd.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.900
I'll take care of you. However, in the meantime, be faithful, be patient.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:37.900
And now in chapter 1, in fact, chapter 2, verse 3, Jehovah shows,

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.900
and it explains to Habakkuk exactly what he is doing as well.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.900
Chapter 2 and verse 3.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.280
The vision is yet for its appointed time.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.280
It's rushing toward its end, and it will not lie, even if it should delay.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.280
You see the vision, the destruction of Jerusalem, it is rushing toward its end.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.280
It's eagerly moving forward toward its fulfillment, Habakkuk, and even if it should delay.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.280
You'd be careful. In the imperfect mind, it might delay.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.280
Maybe Habakkuk and others thought, well, didn't Isaiah say that Babylon was going to destroy Jerusalem?

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.280
That was 100 years ago. It didn't happen yet.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.280
But it might delay in one's mind.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.280
However, what does Jehovah say there in verse 3, the last sentence?

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.280
It will not be late. Habakkuk, it will not be late.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:40.280
And in 20 years, 20 years later, in 607 BCE, Jerusalem was destroyed.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.280
So any delay was a perceived delay due to imperfection.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.280
607 BCE. Oh, it's easy for us. We look back in history.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.280
We look back and we say from our standpoint, 607.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.280
Of course it was 607.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.280
That was a crucial date in Bible prophecy.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.280
607 linked to the birth of God's kingdom in 1914.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.280
607, the end of the Gentile, or it's beginning of the Gentile times.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:16.279
We get it. But Habakkuk, Jeremiah and others, did not have the luxury of looking back retro-specatively and say,

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.279
it's going to be in 607.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:24.279
No, Jehovah just said to them, it will not be late.

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:30.279
Your job, your work, be faithful, be patient.

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:35.279
I am doing something. That's what he's telling Habakkuk.

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:38.279
Same with us today, Armageddon. It's fixed.

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:41.279
It's predetermined the hour, the day it's coming.

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:44.279
It will not be late.

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:47.279
What do we do? Be patient. Be faithful.

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:50.279
We trust in Jehovah.

00:04:50.279 --> 00:05:00.279
Now in verse 4, Jehovah gives Habakkuk tremendous encouragement and encouragement that is so practical for you and me today.

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:04.279
The last portion of verse 4, let's read that please.

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:13.279
But the righteous one, that's Habakkuk, will live by me, will live by his faithfulness.

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:17.279
The righteous one. That's you and me.

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:23.279
We are trying to be righteous. We want to hold to Jehovah's standards. We love Jehovah.

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:30.279
But now Jehovah says, just live by faithfulness. Live by faithfulness. What does that mean?

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:34.279
That statement is more important than ever before, faith.

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:38.279
The assured expectation of things that Jehovah says will come true.

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:46.279
The confidence and the conviction that everything Jehovah says is going to be in our best interests, faithful.

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:53.279
But we need to be faithful more than ever before because look at how Jehovah's allowed wickedness to increase proliferate.

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:57.279
It is so wicked today.

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:00.279
The websites that one can stumble into.

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:05.279
The wicked websites that can take one's spirituality away.

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:14.589
The more that Jehovah allows wickedness, violence, and so forth to proliferate on the earth, that's more of a test of our love for Him.

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:21.589
How deep is our devotion to Jehovah? How much do we love Him? What is in our hearts? It causes us to take a stand.

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:28.589
So being faithful is not simply a mental acknowledgement that I'm one of Jehovah's witnesses, no.

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:43.589
Rather being faithful means complete trust in Jehovah's promises and being firmly convinced that whatever Jehovah asks us to do is in our best interests.

00:06:43.589 --> 00:07:00.589
Complete trust in Jehovah's promises and being firmly convinced, having this conviction that's being firmly persuaded, that whatever Jehovah asks us to do is in our best interests.

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:05.589
This point is so powerful that Paul quoted it three times in the Greek scriptures.

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:14.589
Faith. Over 500 times in the Bible, we could go on and on. That's how important this word faith is.

00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:18.589
So that's what Jehovah now is telling a backup.

00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:27.589
But now, chapter 3 and verse 2, how does one build confidence? How does one build faith? Chapter 3 and verse 2.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:39.660
Oh, Jehovah, I've heard the report about you. This is what a backup did. He meditated on Jehovah and the reports about him.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:49.660
What reports? Oh, the Red Sea, Jericho, 185,000 Assyrians killed and Hezekiah's Day. These were reports of a backup meditated on.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:58.660
And it built his confidence in Jehovah. And he says, I'm an all of Jehovah of your activity. Jehovah's activity is fear inspiring.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:05.660
That's what it does for us too. When we meditate on all that Jehovah has done for his people today, the fulfillment of prophecies.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:12.660
No wonder, Habakkuk said, in the midst of the years, bring it to life. Bring it back to your Father. Bring it back.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:20.660
I'm confident you will revive your activity in behalf of faithful ones. And that's again our prayer.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:27.329
In spite of the difficult conditions, Habakkuk lived in and had to face.

00:08:28.329 --> 00:08:39.330
After meditating on Jehovah's activity, Habakkuk was moved to utter what may be one of the most memorable expressions ever expressed.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:47.330
An expression of confidence ever expressed by a human. And that's in verse 18 of chapter 3.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:09:00.330
For me, I will exalt in Jehovah. And I will be joyful in the God of my salvation. In spite of the challenges, this means literally jump for joy.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:12.330
I'm going to spin around. I'm going to spin around in my love for you and joy for you, my delight in God. What a beautiful expression of confidence that Habakkuk had.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:23.330
Habakkuk disappears from the account, but his message remains. And that message is loud and clear for you and me today. Trust in Jehovah.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:36.330
And when we do that, with our acts of worship, each time we trust in Jehovah and show him how much we love him, in spite of our problems, Jehovah's heart rejoices. And he loves our worship.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:45.330
So in confidence, let us trust in Jehovah. Like Habakkuk, pour out our anxieties and concerns to our Heavenly Father.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:55.330
Pay attention to prophecy. It will not be late. And above all, let's be patient. Let's be faithful as we wait on our God of salvation.
