00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.339
At 1 Corinthians 213, the Apostle Paul wrote,

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:48.659
When we allow the publications of the faithful discrete slave to explain God's word,

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:53.159
this has the most powerful motivating effect on our minds and hearts.

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:58.159
That is the main objective here in the Theocratic schools department at Patterson, New York.

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.460
At first, it may seem straightforward enough.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.459
However, the very nature of divine education is not static, rather, it's dynamic.

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:13.019
Because our God is dynamic.

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:18.019
As Jehovah's Purpose advances, so does our understanding.

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:24.019
As a result, everything taught at our Theocratic schools must be kept up to date.

00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:26.019
And that's no small task.

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:34.519
In the past nine years, around 800,000 students will have attended just three schools in the field.

00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:37.519
The School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:40.019
The School for Congregation Elders.

00:01:40.019 --> 00:01:44.019
And the School for Circuit Overseers and Their Wives.

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:51.019
We want each student in every school to benefit from our most current understanding.

00:01:51.019 --> 00:02:01.739
How does the schools department keep global curriculums current, unified, and motivating?

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:06.239
So one of the important tools that we have is our Watchtower Publications Index.

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:09.240
In the Index, there's a section entitled Beliefs Clarified.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.240
And we have had quite a few clarifications in the last ten years.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.740
So we follow that very, very closely.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:24.240
And we're looking at when there is a belief clarified, how will that affect the outlines we have in our schools, what's being taught?

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.740
And do we need to make a change? How can we incorporate that into an outline?

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:35.740
And that way the instructors will always have the freshest and the most up-to-date materials to teach the classes.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:42.240
Now we want to take special note of Galatians chapter 2 and especially verse 19.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:50.240
Paul was not speaking about dying as a condemned criminal under the mosaic law as we previously understood.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.240
Rather, Paul was highlighting and speaking about the being liberated from him.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:06.240
There are times when a scripture point has changed, a citation needs to be changed, a reference is no longer appropriate.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.740
And so the outlines have to be revised accordingly.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:18.740
When a revision is made in one outline, all the other components in that unit, such as the instructor's outline,

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:24.740
the student's outline, and the study guide, must be checked, updated, and harmonized.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:37.240
Then, that newly revised unit is sent around the world to the branch offices to be translated and implemented into around 150 languages in which these schools are taught.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.240
And that's just for one lesson in one school.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.740
However, units are often shared across multiple schools.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:55.740
So when a change is made in one unit, for example, in Gilead, we have to make that change in all the other school curriculums where that unit appears.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:02.310
In this way, all the schools stay harmonious and unified.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:09.810
Since Gilead is our largest curriculum, it takes diligent effort to keep it fresh and motivating.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.810
One of the things that's been used in Gilead for decades has been the use of visual aids.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.810
Usually, there were handmade models, and an example of that is the tabernacle.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:25.810
It just really helps students to understand what the tabernacle looked like, how it was made, how it was put together, and came apart.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:33.810
As technology has developed, so now we have 3D models on the person's tablet or on the monitors in the classroom.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.810
We can actually take them to the tabernacle.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:44.310
We can turn the tabernacle, we can show it in different ways, things that just wasn't possible 80 years ago when Gilead got its start.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:05:00.740
Another way the school's department works to keep the Gilead curriculum fresh and up-to-date is by incorporating our latest publications and video segments as soon as possible.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.740
For example, the Daniel Dramma that was released at the regional convention in 2021.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:15.740
We got the materials in September of 2021, and we were able to extract the portions that we wanted to be used in Gilead by December of 2021.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.740
So it really only took 4 months to get that all processed and put into the curriculum.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:30.740
Well, after seeing the dream or what it may have looked like, you can understand why Daniel wrote that Nebuchadnezzar was so agitated, he couldn't sleep.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:41.740
Another example of our efforts to keep our Gilead curriculum fresh and up-to-date was the release of the Bible Study Aid, Enjoy Life Forever.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:49.740
Shortly after it's released in 2021, it was soon put into the Gilead curriculum and we began teaching it in our workshops.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.740
Well, we would certainly like to thank our two sisters for that excellent demonstration.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:04.740
So how did the teacher use the Explore section of the book to help reach the heart of her student?

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:14.740
Since Gilead School and Pioneer School share similar lessons, the adjustments needed to be made to the Pioneer School curriculum as well.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.740
Pioneers are going to absolutely love the updated curriculum for the Pioneer Service School.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:27.740
Not only have references been updated, so the teachers and gods love book references have been updated to enjoy Life Forever Book.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:42.740
But the workshops are now redesigned to help Pioneers start Bible studies using the new publication, to learn how to use its features effectively, and even how to adapt each lesson to their own Bible students.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:48.740
The new Pioneer School will just build on their enthusiasm, their excitement to start Bible studies.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.740
Any forms of the ministry they'll be looking to start Bible studies, and that enthusiasm is contagious.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.740
So we know that it'll actually have a good effect on congregations worldwide.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:07.740
Not only does the Theocratic Schools Department revise individual units in the curriculums, but at times entire schools.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:15.740
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the curriculum for the school for circuit overseers and their wives was completely revised.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:21.740
And once approved by the Teaching Committee, it was sent to the branch's worldwide for translation.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:27.740
We were very excited when the Teaching Committee sent us a letter about the school for circuit overseers and their wives.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:34.740
It was going to be an interactive school with workshops, new outlines, new videos, study guides.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:44.740
When you have someone who loves Jehovah and the ministry, and you dig deep into the scriptures, it has a very powerful effect on the person.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.740
It can even change your spiritual DNA as a saying goes.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.740
We can see that it was going to be a very powerful course.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:08:00.740
Combining spiritual matters with spiritual words throughout our global Theocratic Schools takes tremendous work.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.740
But Jehovah is clearly blessing the efforts of everyone involved.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:08.740
Well, it's obvious that Jehovah wants his people to be educated.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:19.740
And the amount of effort and resources that the faithful slave have put into educating God's people is second to none.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:28.740
People come to school, they attend the Theocratic School, and they're built up, but then they go, and they affect the people around them.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:39.740
These ones that go through these schools, they want to talk about the things they learned, and they felt, and they experienced, and how it has affected them.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.740
And they're going to talk about it.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.740
You're going to hear it at your midweek meeting in here at the Watchdust study.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:49.740
You see a brother working parts in his public talks.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.740
Out in the ministry, they're sharing.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:56.740
And you know, expression, deepens impression.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:02.740
And so as they give, it deepens the truth in them even more.

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:13.110
Jehovah is making sure that throughout the globe, spiritual matters are explained with spiritual words, his inspired words, his textbook.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:23.110
You may not have the circumstances to attend a Theocratic School beyond your midweek meeting, but we all have access to the same textbook.

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:36.110
So every time you make an updated note in your textbook, God's Word, whether it's a clarified belief or a point from our publications, you are in effect in school with us.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:46.110
We are so thankful that Jehovah has helped us to keep divine education and sync with his unfolding purpose, no matter who we are or where we live.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:53.110
And be assured, divine education is not winding down. It's just beginning.
