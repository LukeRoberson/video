00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:09.580
Welcome to our program. This month's theme is, you are precious to Jehovah. Here

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.939
are some highlights. When we're going through difficult times, does Jehovah

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:21.739
notice? As we'll learn in Malu's experience, Jehovah does care and he helps us

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:27.300
overcome even the most challenging circumstances. Prayer is a powerful way

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.859
that we can ask for and receive loving comfort from Jehovah. We'll see that in

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:38.060
our new music video. Soon all over the earth, Jehovah's witnesses will be

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.820
inviting people to this year's conventions. Can attending a convention change a

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:50.020
person's life? We'll find out in this report. Welcome to the April 2020

00:00:50.020 --> 00:01:15.000
edition of J.W. Broadcasting. We begin with the experience of Juan Pablo

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:27.060
Sermenio. Notice how he found a life of real meaning and purpose. When you're

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:39.019
a little, you just want to be happy. But sadly, my father had a problem with

00:01:39.019 --> 00:01:54.799
alcohol and no child wants to live through that. One day, my family from the

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:02.700
United States came to visit us. They look so happy. The way they talked it was

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:12.120
as though they only had fun. A good life, no economic problems. I was shocked. I

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.000
asked myself, how can we live in such poverty while their life is so great? That

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:35.819
was the life I wanted for my family. So when I was nine years old, I left my

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.699
mother and the rest of my family to cross the border into the United States. I

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:49.430
lived in a pretty rough neighborhood. So I joined a local gym to learn how to

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:59.389
defend myself. The trainer Leo, he was like a father to me. He always tried to

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:06.860
give us good advice. Raymond was part of the boxing team. He was a good friend.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:14.060
We got along really well. He respected me and he looked after me. After several

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.139
years of being around Raymond and the other members of the team, I felt

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:23.659
really comfortable. To some extent, I admired him because I could see he

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:31.580
really doing well because Raymond was selling drugs. I knew that it wasn't right.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:39.819
By the time, I began to sell drugs as well. Raymond was in a drug deal gone

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:51.219
wrong where he was murdered. I said to myself, this could happen to me too. It

00:03:51.219 --> 00:04:07.569
had been six years since I had seen my mom and my siblings. My mother was

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:13.400
studying the Bible with Jehovah's Witnesses. It helped her cope with a lot of

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:23.240
suffering. It brought her peace. She was so happy. I began to realize that this

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:29.160
was what I really needed. I also thought about my friends at the gym. I wanted

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:35.560
them to understand why life was so hard for all of us. So I returned to the

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:43.680
United States. But they weren't interested. My trainer Leo told me I didn't need

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.800
to sell drugs anymore. He could make me a professional boxer and I could help

00:04:48.800 --> 00:05:03.860
up my family in that way. He even gave me a nickname, the Bible boy. But I

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.860
realized that was just a temporary solution. What I was learning was going to

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:16.779
help forever. I was determined to serve Jehovah. I returned to Mexico. I started

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:21.939
to study the Bible and take it seriously. I began to view Jehovah as my father

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:27.860
because he helped me to find real relief from my pain. To have peace. A

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:35.980
tranquility that makes you feel accepted, loved, and wanted. I have enjoyed an

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:45.779
incredible life serving Jehovah. Decades later, my father was baptized as one of

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:52.779
Jehovah's Witnesses. Jehovah has been so kind to me. My family and my siblings.

00:05:52.779 --> 00:06:00.019
Truly, I have no way to repay Jehovah for the life he has given me. I've had

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:06.579
so many blessings in my life. A wonderful wife, great friends, including those

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:13.939
that I serve alongside in Bethel. I'm not on my own anymore. Jehovah has given me

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:23.139
a life full of real meaning, purpose, and so much happiness. Can you imagine

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:29.060
leaving your home at the age of nine? One Pablo saw the better life, but that

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.860
only led to danger and disappointment. One Pablo said it was Jehovah who gave

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:41.540
him a life full of real meaning, purpose, and happiness. One Pablo is precious to

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:48.779
Jehovah. As we mentioned, our theme for this month's program is, you are

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:57.579
precious to Jehovah. How vital it is that we remind ourselves of that. Why? Well,

00:06:57.579 --> 00:07:03.420
let's consider three reasons. First, Satan wants us to believe that Jehovah

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:10.500
doesn't love us or value our service. He wanted Job to believe that, but that was

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:17.579
a lie in Job's day and it's still a lie today. A second reason that we need to

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:22.660
be reminded that we're precious to Jehovah is because of negative circumstances or

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:28.500
events that have taken place in our life. Severe illness, advancing years,

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:35.500
injustices, mistreatment, a difficult family life, or other situations may

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:41.699
call some brothers and sisters to feel that they're just not worth loving. Some may

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:48.220
question why Jehovah allows those things to happen. Finally, we need reminders of

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:53.060
how Jehovah feels about us because our imperfection can cause us to have

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:58.259
negative thoughts. Some may still punish themselves for past mistakes,

00:07:58.259 --> 00:08:04.540
doubting that Jehovah has forgiven them or that he could ever love them. Others

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:09.939
wage a constant battle against feelings of worthlessness. One witness wrote,

00:08:09.939 --> 00:08:16.699
Satan has done an excellent job of making even those who love Jehovah feel

00:08:16.699 --> 00:08:23.259
worthless and unlovable. I never felt worthy of Jehovah's love, so I tried to do

00:08:23.259 --> 00:08:28.379
more and more in his service as a way of earning that love. So no matter how

00:08:28.379 --> 00:08:33.179
many hours I spent in the ministry or how many people I helped, I felt it was

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:42.539
not enough. I saw only the lack in me. One brother stated, I came from a family

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:49.419
that showed little love. I was belittled, teased, and laughed at. So early in

00:08:49.419 --> 00:08:55.820
life, I felt worthless. I still carry entrenched feelings from my past that

00:08:55.820 --> 00:09:00.899
beat me down when I experienced calamity. When I stopped serving as a

00:09:00.899 --> 00:09:08.220
congregation elder, I felt like a failure as usual. To God, my family, and my

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:14.690
brothers in the congregation. If you've experienced such feelings, you're not

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:21.450
alone. So how can you be assured of Jehovah's interest? Let's examine three

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:28.250
lines of evidence that prove your precious to Jehovah. First, we'll examine

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:33.649
Jehovah's feelings for the nation of Israel. Second, we'll reflect on an event

00:09:33.649 --> 00:09:39.289
recorded in the Gospels. And third, we'll consider a modern-day example of one

00:09:39.289 --> 00:09:47.850
who was very precious to God. By the end of the 16th century BCE, millions of

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:53.289
Israelites were enslaved in Egypt, where they were severely oppressed. In their

00:09:53.289 --> 00:10:00.210
distress, the Israelites cried out to Jehovah. How did he feel? Turn with me to

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:06.009
Isaiah chapter 63, verse 9. The A-Portion reads,

00:10:06.009 --> 00:10:14.210
During all their distress, it was distressing to him. Did you notice? Not only did

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:19.730
Jehovah see their troubles, he felt for his people, and he was moved to act in

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:24.690
their behalf. Isaiah chapter 63 verse 9 goes on to say,

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:32.570
In his love and compassion, he repurchased them. Jehovah couldn't see their

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:37.690
suffering or hear their outcries without feeling for them, and doing something

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:43.370
about it. That may remind us of the loving concern that a mother has for her

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:49.370
newborn child. When that baby cries, the mother takes notice, and she feels for

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:55.690
her child. In fact, notice how this is expressed at Isaiah chapter 49 verse 15.

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:59.289
It reads,

00:10:59.289 --> 00:11:04.210
Can a woman forget her nursing child or have no compassion for the son of her

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:13.049
womb? Even if these women forget, I would never forget you. It's hard to

00:11:13.049 --> 00:11:17.929
imagine a mother forgetting to nourish and care for her nursing child. That baby

00:11:17.929 --> 00:11:24.090
is helpless. Day and night it needs its mother's attention. Sad to say,

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:30.090
however, we hear at times of such maternal neglect. But what did Jehovah say to

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:38.570
reassure the Israelites? I would never forget you. Yes, the tender compassion

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:43.409
that Jehovah felt for his servants was immeasurably stronger than one of the

00:11:43.409 --> 00:11:48.649
most tender and natural feelings we can imagine. The compassion a mother

00:11:48.649 --> 00:11:54.409
normally feels for her baby. Jehovah's feelings for the Israelites are

00:11:54.409 --> 00:11:59.090
summed up in another expression in the book of Isaiah. Please read with me Isaiah

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:03.250
chapter 43 verse 4.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:12.450
For you became precious in my eyes. You were honored and I have loved you. Jehovah

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:18.460
clearly expressed his feelings for his people. As one of Jehovah's servants,

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:24.500
you can be sure that he also loves you most tenderly. No matter what trials

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:29.980
you're facing now or have endured in the past, Jehovah sees you and he feels

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:37.620
for you. When you hurt, he hurts. You are far too precious to Jehovah for him

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:43.379
to forget you. He remembers your past efforts and he sees your continuing

00:12:43.379 --> 00:12:49.700
efforts to please him. Notice how Jehovah promises to sustain and comfort his

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:58.139
people according to Isaiah chapter 66 verses 12 and 13. You will nurse and be

00:12:58.139 --> 00:13:04.379
carried on the hip and you will be bounced on the knees as a mother comforts

00:13:04.379 --> 00:13:12.500
her son so I will keep comforting you. What a heartwarming scene. Imagine a

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:19.019
loving mother carrying a baby on her hip or bouncing him on her knees. In this

00:13:19.019 --> 00:13:24.899
way, Jehovah touchingly illustrates the intensity and tenderness of his love

00:13:24.899 --> 00:13:31.620
for you. Just as Jehovah loved his people Israel, he likewise feels that you are

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:40.419
very precious and dear. Never doubt that. A second example of how Jehovah feels

00:13:40.419 --> 00:13:45.259
about his faithful servants can be found in the gospels. Let's read what

00:13:45.259 --> 00:13:49.700
happened on one occasion when Jesus was at the temple in Jerusalem at Luke

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:57.220
chapter 21 verses 1 through 4. Now as he looked up, he saw the rich dropping

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:03.500
their gifts into the treasury chests. Then he saw a needy widow drop in two

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:11.659
small coins, a very little value. And he said, truly I say to you that this poor

00:14:11.659 --> 00:14:17.539
widow put in more than they all did. For all of these put in gifts out of their

00:14:17.539 --> 00:14:25.580
surplus, but she, out of her want, or as the footnote says, poverty, put in all

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:31.740
the means of living she had. The study note for verse 2 in the New World

00:14:31.779 --> 00:14:36.899
Translation of the Holy Scriptures tells us that the Greek word for needy may

00:14:36.899 --> 00:14:42.259
describe a person who lacks the basic necessities of life or someone for whom

00:14:42.259 --> 00:14:47.419
life is a great struggle. In the Christian Greek Scriptures, it is used only

00:14:47.419 --> 00:14:54.220
here. Just think about the widow's circumstances. Not only had she experienced

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:59.179
the grief of losing her husband, her provider, but she also lived in a

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:03.740
religious climate dominated by leaders who, according to Luke chapter 20

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:10.019
verse 47, would devour the houses of the widows rather than help such vulnerable

00:15:10.019 --> 00:15:16.659
ones. That widow was so poor that her contribution to the temple was what a

00:15:16.659 --> 00:15:24.980
labor might earn in just a few minutes. Life wasn't easy for her. In fact, Jesus

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:31.460
said that she put in all the means of living she had. Our publications have

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:38.299
stated that the coins the widow contributed were likely to lepta. With eight

00:15:38.299 --> 00:15:43.019
lepta, a person could buy two sparrows, which were among the cheapest birds

00:15:43.019 --> 00:15:50.539
used for food. So the widow had only half the amount needed to buy one sparrow,

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:56.259
hardly enough for a single meal. Yet both the widow and her contribution were

00:15:56.259 --> 00:16:02.419
valuable to Jehovah. Jesus said that her contribution was greater than the

00:16:02.419 --> 00:16:08.220
contributions of the rich. When she put those two small coins in the treasury

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:12.980
chest, they would be mixed with what the rich had put in. To imperfect human

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:19.019
eyes, they might seem lost, buried. Yet this precious widow was the one Jesus

00:16:19.019 --> 00:16:24.220
singled out for praise. When the treasury workers came across the coins, they

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:29.659
wouldn't have known how precious the coins and their donor were to Jehovah. But

00:16:29.659 --> 00:16:34.539
God's view was the one that really mattered, not what other people thought, or

00:16:34.539 --> 00:16:40.620
even how that dear widow viewed herself. Like that widow, you may find that

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:46.139
circumstances limit what you can contribute to Jehovah. Age,

00:16:46.139 --> 00:16:51.539
infirmities, or other circumstances beyond your control may limit the amount of

00:16:51.539 --> 00:16:56.659
time you're able to spend in the ministry. You might feel that your efforts are

00:16:56.659 --> 00:17:03.740
like those two small coins, a very little value. Still, we learned from this

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:09.619
account of the needy widow that Jehovah notices, and he treasures each act done

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:16.400
for him, especially when we do it despite difficult circumstances. For a

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:22.380
moment, think back on your worship of Jehovah during the past year. Some of you

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:27.059
may feel that you accomplished little. Your imperfect heart might cause you to

00:17:27.059 --> 00:17:32.779
wonder whether Jehovah was pleased with your efforts. However, did one of the

00:17:32.779 --> 00:17:39.339
hours you spent require a special sacrifice on your part? If Jehovah took

00:17:39.339 --> 00:17:44.859
notice of the widow dropping in those two coins and valued her contribution,

00:17:44.859 --> 00:17:49.700
don't you think he also noticed and values what you did for him during that

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:56.700
hour? Jehovah values every gift, no matter how small, that springs from a heart

00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:02.539
motivated by love. He remembers, and he'll reward even the smallest

00:18:02.539 --> 00:18:08.220
contribution given in support of his kingdom. That's proof of how Jehovah feels

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:15.589
about you. Finally, let's consider a modern-day example of one who was very

00:18:15.589 --> 00:18:22.950
precious to Jehovah. It's the experience of Sister Aretti Pina. Sister Pina lived

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:27.890
on the southern coast of Albania in the town of Vlor. She was baptized in

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:34.430
1928 at the age of 18. There was a strong congregation in Vlor in the 1930s,

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:39.630
and Sister Pina was a zealous evangelizer who climbed up and down rugged

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:45.829
mountains, preaching with her Bible in hand. In time, a congregation no longer

00:18:45.829 --> 00:18:52.150
existed in Vlor, and Sister Pina lost contact with the brothers. Yet, she kept

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:56.950
preaching faithfully on her own. Do you think her efforts went unnoticed by

00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:01.950
Jehovah? Well, years later, word reached the brothers that there was an old

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:08.109
senile woman who was reportedly preaching in Vlor. People thought she was crazy

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:14.710
for keeping faith in God during years of totalitarian rule. Yet Sister Pina, now

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:20.630
in her 80s, was anything but senile. When the brothers arrived at her home,

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:26.950
Sister Pina invited them in, but she seemed somewhat reserved. When they

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:33.150
explained that they were her spiritual brothers, she had no reaction. After a

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:38.470
few minutes, Sister Pina started firing questions at the brothers. Do you believe

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:43.750
in the Trinity? What is God's name? Do you believe in hellfire? What happens when

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:49.630
we die? What about the earth? How many go to heaven? The brothers answered each

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:58.069
question. Do you preach? She then asked. Yes, said one brother. We preach, but she

00:19:58.069 --> 00:20:03.750
responded. How do you preach? We preach from house to house, replied the

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:11.109
brother. Now, I know that you are my brothers, she exclaimed. Only Jehovah's

00:20:11.109 --> 00:20:16.990
people preach from house to house. Through her tears, Sister Pina stated,

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:25.579
Jehovah is wonderful. He never forgot me. Sometime later, the brothers were

00:20:25.579 --> 00:20:29.619
notified that Sister Pina was ill and that she wanted to meet with one of the

00:20:29.619 --> 00:20:36.740
responsible brothers. When he arrived, she asked in part as she gasped for air,

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:44.460
has the book of Revelation been fulfilled? The brother responded. Yes, Arati. Most

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:52.259
of it has. Sister Pina said, now I can die in peace. I needed to know how close

00:20:52.259 --> 00:20:59.019
we are. Shortly after that conversation, Sister Pina faithfully finished her

00:20:59.019 --> 00:21:06.339
earthly course. What do you think? During all those years of isolation from the

00:21:06.339 --> 00:21:11.460
earthly part of Jehovah's organization, did Sister Pina's efforts go unnoticed by

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:19.460
Jehovah? Absolutely not. Just imagine Jehovah's joy as he watched her faithfully

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:25.339
doing what she could in his service. Do you think that Sister Pina was precious to

00:21:25.339 --> 00:21:32.980
Jehovah without a doubt she was? Well, your efforts in Jehovah's service do not

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:41.670
go unnoticed by him either. Like Sister Pina, you are precious to him. So what is

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:46.910
this consideration helped us to realize? We may have to contend with Satan's lies,

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:53.470
negative circumstances, and events in our lives, and our own imperfections. But

00:21:53.509 --> 00:22:00.269
we should never forget that Jehovah highly values his servants. We saw that in his words

00:22:00.269 --> 00:22:06.630
to the Israelites through the prophet Isaiah. You can be sure that Jehovah loves you most

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:13.230
tenderly. No matter what trials you're facing now or have endured in the past, Jehovah

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:22.309
sees you and he feels for you. When you hurt, he hurts. Your far too precious to Jehovah

00:22:22.309 --> 00:22:29.420
for him to forget you. The account of the widow at Luke chapter 21 can assure you that

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:35.299
all those circumstances may affect what you can contribute to Jehovah. He notices and

00:22:35.299 --> 00:22:43.059
treasures each act you do for him, especially when you do it in the face of difficult circumstances.

00:22:43.059 --> 00:22:51.140
He remembers and he will reward even the smallest contribution given in support of his kingdom.

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:56.140
In what beautiful modern-day examples we have in the organization of brothers and sisters

00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:02.579
who have proven their loyalty to Jehovah and are precious to him. Like the example of Sister Pina.

00:23:02.579 --> 00:23:14.299
Dear brothers and sisters, please never forget that you are precious to Jehovah. Here's another

00:23:14.299 --> 00:23:22.500
modern-day example. Sister Malum Merck. As we'll see, she faced a number of serious hardships

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:40.819
early in life. Notice all the ways she received comfort from Jehovah. My name is Malum Merck.

00:23:40.819 --> 00:23:55.119
No one can imagine how much Jehovah has helped me. I was raised in Sicimia in Greenland.

00:23:55.119 --> 00:24:03.039
My childhood was wonderful. We were very often out in nature. In the summer we sailed and in

00:24:03.039 --> 00:24:11.230
the winter we rode dogslets and we went hunting and fishing. When I was a child I was very close

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:19.750
to my parents. I was a daddy's girl. He called me my beloved. So beloved became my nickname.

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:25.269
It has been so wonderful to be raised in the truth. The greatest gift that I could get

00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:35.140
is to know Jehovah through them. When I was nine years old, my parents got divorced.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:42.220
It was terrible. I saw how my siblings were hurt. It cannot be explained how, I mean, we were

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:48.579
very wounded in our hearts. When my parents divorced, my father was disfellowshipped. It was very

00:24:48.579 --> 00:24:57.579
hard to be separated like that. I missed my dad a lot. When my mom started to drink, I also

00:24:57.579 --> 00:25:03.900
felt abandoned. Because I knew what she had been doing. I was not surprised when after some

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:15.500
time she was disfellowshipped. But of course I felt very hurt and sad. I supplicated Jehovah to help me

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:24.779
stay in the truth. The pioneer sister that studied with me helped me a lot. She studied with me,

00:25:24.779 --> 00:25:33.710
sometimes took me on the ministry and invited me to dinner. When I was about 12 years old, my father

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:42.059
came back into the truth. I was very happy that it finally happened. I began to have a good

00:25:42.059 --> 00:25:48.779
relationship with him again. We sailed a lot, drove snowmobile and rode dog slitch. And my father

00:25:48.779 --> 00:25:55.579
and I watched movies in the evening. I remember that when my dad heard that I was going to be baptized,

00:25:55.579 --> 00:26:14.019
he shed a tear. And I could see he was proud. When I was 15 years old, my world fell to pieces.

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:23.680
My father committed suicide. It's difficult to describe that my father was suddenly gone.

00:26:25.119 --> 00:26:39.579
I can't understand why he would do such a selfish thing. I missed him a lot. He was like my heart

00:26:39.579 --> 00:26:58.849
was stabbed. I was also very angry at him. I rode a lot. And I rode many letters to my father about

00:26:58.849 --> 00:27:09.380
things I wanted to tell him. I also cried out to Jehovah in long prayers. I loved some 34-18

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:15.700
about Jehovah being close to those who were crushed in spirit. That was how I felt. And the

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:23.460
thought that Jehovah is close to them comforts me a lot. I also did all I could to go to all the

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:32.819
meetings. Even when I didn't want to see anyone. Even if I cried before the meeting, I went anyway.

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:42.990
One month after my father's death, I got baptized. I got baptized because I loved Jehovah.

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:49.380
When I was nine years old, I had promised Jehovah to serve him for the rest of my life.

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:59.740
My relationship with my mother is much better now. It is great to serve Jehovah together with

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:07.970
her now. We preach together every Sunday. And I always look forward to going on the ministry

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:15.660
together with her. When I was 18 years old, I began to help in the remote translation office.

00:28:16.859 --> 00:28:25.740
Later, I started pioneering. I have always learned a lot from King David. No matter what circumstance

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:37.539
he faced, whether bad or good, he used them to draw close to Jehovah. Jehovah has helped me.

00:28:37.779 --> 00:28:44.019
To overcome challenges through the congregation, giving me power beyond what is normal,

00:28:45.539 --> 00:28:56.829
taking me in as his daughter. As a child, Malu's nickname was beloved. Yet for a while she

00:28:56.829 --> 00:29:04.029
filled anything but loved. She said her world fell to pieces. Have you ever felt that way?

00:29:04.509 --> 00:29:11.069
I remember what helped Malu stay close to Jehovah. A pioneer sister encouraged her.

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:16.029
Personal study reminded Malu that Jehovah helped his servants in the past.

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:23.470
She pursued spiritual goals such as auxiliary pioneering. And she went to as many Christian meetings

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:30.750
as she could, even when she wanted to be alone. In all these ways, Malu was reminded that she

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:41.009
is precious to Jehovah. As she said, Jehovah has taken me in as his daughter. For some people,

00:29:41.009 --> 00:29:45.089
staying busy may seem like the right thing to do when they've suffered a serious setback.

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:50.930
Does staying busy really help? Let's find out in this dramatization.

00:29:54.259 --> 00:30:04.319
I, Stephen, take you, Emily, to be my wedded wife. I, Emily, take you, Stephen, to be my wedded husband.

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:16.900
I had no doubt our vows were forever. Nothing could have prepared me for the heartbreak.

00:30:19.869 --> 00:30:42.099
I never expected her to be unfaithful and unwilling to work things out. I felt humiliated.

00:30:45.279 --> 00:30:52.339
How could she do such a thing? I was embarrassed and I didn't want to talk to anyone.

00:31:01.009 --> 00:31:11.339
I read somewhere that time would help me heal. And just to stay busy, it seemed to work.

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:22.859
But I was constantly reminded of what I lost. Our spiritual goals, the hopes and dreams we had,

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:51.710
all destroyed. I didn't want to dwell on the hurt. But I just couldn't ignore it. Was I really coping?

00:31:53.309 --> 00:32:03.089
Or was I leaving myself open to even more pain? I was angry.

00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:08.769
But not just with Emily, I was angry with everything.

00:32:08.769 --> 00:32:17.250
Stephen, Stephen. Hey, let me stop by tomorrow.

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:31.069
What I had to say, I went in a blame time for judging me. But he didn't.

00:32:31.069 --> 00:32:43.839
You're right, I'm Stephen. I can't understand how you feel. But you know who can. Do you remember

00:32:44.079 --> 00:32:53.869
Psalm 34? I think verse 18 says it best. Can you read it for us?

00:32:56.799 --> 00:33:02.480
Jehovah is close to the broken hearted. He saves those who are crushed in spirit.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:11.200
In that beautiful scripture, take advantage of Jehovah being that close to you and include him

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:21.230
in everything. Jehovah is a loving shepherd. When we hurt, he cares. I knew this.

00:33:22.109 --> 00:33:30.849
But in a way, I'd forgotten. I realized I hadn't included Jehovah in the ways I tried to cope.

00:33:32.369 --> 00:33:36.369
Staying busy was important, but I needed to draw closer to God.

00:33:37.569 --> 00:33:48.460
Not push away. And when I did, the real healing began. Even though the pain is still there,

00:33:49.420 --> 00:34:02.480
Jehovah sees the tears. Jehovah feels what I feel. It is getting better. Slowly.

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:37.250
Because Jehovah is close to the broken hearted. The vast majority of marriage is among

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:42.690
Jehovah's people prosper because Christian husbands and wives apply Bible principles.

00:34:43.809 --> 00:34:49.809
But a few fail to live up to their marriage commitment. Are you among the broken hearted?

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:57.570
If so, never forget that you are precious to Jehovah. And remember what will help you heal.

00:34:58.849 --> 00:35:04.050
In our dramatization, Stephen kept himself busy with recreation and other activities.

00:35:04.929 --> 00:35:09.650
But he experienced true comfort and healing when he drew close to Jehovah.

00:35:11.329 --> 00:35:15.809
Always remember how Jehovah is described at Psalm 34 verse 18.

00:35:16.769 --> 00:35:22.210
Jehovah is close to the broken hearted. He saves those who are crushed in spirit.

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:30.829
Prayer is one of the most powerful ways Jehovah helps us. We'll see that in our new music video.

00:35:31.710 --> 00:39:24.369
What a beautiful reminder that we can go to Jehovah in prayer at any time and express our deepest

00:39:24.369 --> 00:39:31.409
feelings to him. As the song says, don't keep that burden in. Roll it on him.

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:39.010
When we're experiencing pain and difficulty in life, it may not be easy to see all that

00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:44.050
Jehovah is doing in our behalf. In the following morning worship program,

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:47.570
where the John Echron helps us to see Jehovah's hand in action.

00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:54.449
Sometimes I think all of us would agree that it's easy to see Jehovah's hand when things are

00:39:54.449 --> 00:40:02.610
going well, when we get a court victory, when someone's health improves, or maybe when someone

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:06.690
really asks to come to study the Bible with us and they're at our meetings.

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:14.210
But it's harder to see Jehovah's hand when we see bad things happen, either to us or our brothers

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:20.530
and sisters. So we may wonder, how can we see Jehovah's hand when bad things are happening?

00:40:21.809 --> 00:40:30.289
Well, you can see my hand right now, right? But if I put it away, you can't see it. Now,

00:40:30.369 --> 00:40:35.409
do you assume because you can't see my hand that I don't have a hand anymore? And it's not,

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:39.889
well, no, you reasoned on the fact that you see the rest of me and there's probably still my hand

00:40:39.889 --> 00:40:47.489
attached. So likewise, there are times when it's easy to see Jehovah's hand and there are other

00:40:47.489 --> 00:40:54.849
times when we have to reason on what we know about Jehovah in order to see his hand in action.

00:40:54.849 --> 00:41:00.369
So let's consider one thing. What do we know about Jehovah that we could reason that his hand

00:41:00.369 --> 00:41:06.130
is in action? Well, let's reason on the point that he is a happy God.

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:13.170
Now, how does Jehovah stay happy seeing all the bad things that are happening?

00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:18.769
Maybe you've wondered that. I know it's crossed my mind. How does Jehovah stay happy

00:41:19.409 --> 00:41:26.130
when he sees all the suffering that's going on? And frankly, he sees all the suffering. He sees

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:32.050
everything going on. I know how I feel and you probably know how you feel just when you read about

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:38.289
what's happening to our brothers in Venezuela or in Russia or with all of the hurricanes and earthquakes

00:41:38.289 --> 00:41:43.809
that we've had in recent times. And we see the suffering, not only of our brothers and sisters,

00:41:43.809 --> 00:41:50.849
but of other people. And we consider how can Jehovah stay happy when he knows all of what is

00:41:50.849 --> 00:41:56.449
happening? Well, let's consider three. I'm sure of many reasons why Jehovah can stay happy even

00:41:56.449 --> 00:42:00.289
though he knows all the suffering. And then we can see how that could benefit us as well.

00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:08.449
But first of all, his hand is hard at work preparing the new world for us. And I think Jeremiah

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:18.849
chapter 29 verse 11 really covers how Jehovah feels about the future for us. Jeremiah 29 11, he says,

00:42:18.849 --> 00:42:23.809
where I will know the thoughts that I am thinking towards you, declares Jehovah, thoughts of peace,

00:42:24.449 --> 00:42:32.369
and not of calamity, to give you a future and a hope. So Jehovah is not simply just watching

00:42:32.449 --> 00:42:40.210
events occur. He's actively working on the solution. He, along with Jesus and the heavenly angels

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:48.610
are working hard on the kingdom. Now, we can't see end to heaven right now. But I want you to just

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:56.929
imagine all the activity of the angels, the resurrected andointed brothers, Jesus, working hard

00:42:56.929 --> 00:43:02.849
on making preparations for Armageddon and the new world. Just think of all the work we're doing

00:43:02.849 --> 00:43:07.489
just to prepare for the annual meeting and dedication. Can you imagine all the work going on

00:43:07.489 --> 00:43:13.329
in heaven that is there? I mean, how far along are the new scrolls? How are basic needs as far

00:43:13.329 --> 00:43:20.369
as clean water, food, and homes going to be provided for the survivors? So while we can't see

00:43:20.369 --> 00:43:27.889
end to heaven, we know that his hand is there. So Jehovah is happy because he's actively working

00:43:27.889 --> 00:43:35.170
right now to make things better for us. What lesson for us? We can be happy when we see the suffering

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:40.690
around us because we know what Jehovah and our brothers are doing up there to prepare for the new

00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:48.050
world. A second point, how about how Jehovah can be happy is that he can comfort us right now. He

00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:56.610
is happy when he can do that. In verse 12 of Jeremiah chapter 29, Jehovah continued after saying

00:43:56.610 --> 00:44:04.690
that he was working on the future, he says, and you will call me and come and pray to me and I will

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:12.690
listen to you. So I love this point because Jehovah is saying, don't worry, I'm taking care of

00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:17.250
building a better future for you. And we appreciate it. If we're going through some trial,

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:22.449
some very difficulty and a good friend of ours reminds us remember, things are going to get

00:44:22.449 --> 00:44:26.530
better in the future. Jehovah is going to change this. It's going to get better. It is comforting.

00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:31.250
But it is also comforting like Jehovah does here in verse 12 when the person says,

00:44:31.969 --> 00:44:36.050
what can I do for you right now? And Jehovah is saying, right now, come, pray to me.

00:44:37.809 --> 00:44:44.530
Jehovah is there to comfort and help us. We can kind of illustrate the way Jehovah feels by thinking

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:50.130
about parents and how they deal with a small child. You've ever seen a small child, maybe two,

00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:57.010
three years of age, and they really fall badly and scrape their knees badly. And they are screaming

00:44:57.010 --> 00:45:04.050
in pain. There's this red liquid leaking out of them. They are distraught. In fact, in that child's

00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:08.849
mind, he may think, this is the end of it. This is end of life as I know it. I'm never going to

00:45:08.849 --> 00:45:16.130
recover from this. I'm going to die. But the parent, of course, their perspective is different,

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:21.090
isn't it? But they comfort the child. They help to take care of the skinny. They comfort them.

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:26.050
And they tell them, you're going to live. It's going to be okay. It's going to be all right.

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:31.889
And why can the parent have that view? Because they know in a few hours, maybe, at least in a week

00:45:31.889 --> 00:45:36.849
or so, child's not even going to remember that skinny. It's going to be just a very distant memory.

00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:43.409
Well, C. Jehovah also knows that whatever we're going through right now, whatever suffering

00:45:43.409 --> 00:45:48.610
we may be going through now, that soon, in that new world, we aren't going to recall that suffering.

00:45:49.329 --> 00:45:54.610
And he knows that he can solve any problem we're facing as easily as we heal from a scraped knee.

00:45:55.250 --> 00:46:02.130
He knows our whole eternal lives are ahead of us. So he comforts us. He listens to our heartfelt

00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:08.289
prayers. And like a kind parent, he's telling us, through our brothers, the Bible and Holy Spirit,

00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:16.369
you will live. See, Jehovah's happy because right now, what can he do? He can comfort us and help us.

00:46:17.329 --> 00:46:23.730
Well, the lesson for us, we can comfort and help others. We're really kind of all in this

00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:28.130
lifeboat together, trying to make it to the new world shore. And we can help one another.

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:35.730
Third, his hand is patiently waiting for the right time to act.

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:40.769
See, Jehovah is waiting patiently for the complete vindication of his sovereignty.

00:46:41.489 --> 00:46:46.530
I really love what the June 2017 Watchtower article, keep your eyes on the big issue,

00:46:47.329 --> 00:46:53.489
said, let us not become so absorbed in our own lives that we lose sight of the big issue,

00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:59.489
the vindication of Jehovah's sovereignty. And let us appreciate that our role in this vital

00:46:59.489 --> 00:47:06.769
issue entails remaining faithful, even under difficult circumstances. Isn't that a beautiful

00:47:06.769 --> 00:47:13.570
quote to think about? See, Jehovah knows that by his being patient now, he and all his

00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:19.730
faithful servants will never have to go through this again. The issue of sovereignty will be completely

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:26.690
settled. I mean, don't you admire Jehovah's patience? I mean, to watch all that is happening and

00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:34.130
to have the self-control to wait for the appointed time is truly an example of patience and action.

00:47:35.329 --> 00:47:39.090
You know, when we think about the different situations, our brothers and sisters and

00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:45.570
others face, when a mother, for example, watches a handicap son struggle to walk or to talk,

00:47:46.449 --> 00:47:52.769
or a husband watches his wife struggle to breathe, you know, we want so much at that moment to

00:47:52.769 --> 00:47:59.090
press that big red start the new world button now. But when you have that feeling,

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:08.210
remember our text for today, the hand of Jehovah will become known to his servants.

00:48:09.969 --> 00:48:18.210
What lesson for us? We need to be patient and keep our eyes on the big issue of Jehovah's sovereignty.

00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:27.329
So let's just review those three points. How can we see Jehovah's hand and be happy when we see

00:48:27.329 --> 00:48:33.409
all of this suffering around us? Well, we can be happy knowing what Jehovah and Jesus and the

00:48:33.409 --> 00:48:39.250
resurrected andointed are doing right now to prepare for the new world. And we can be happy because we

00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:47.730
have a role in comforting and helping others. And we can be happy being patient knowing why we're

00:48:47.730 --> 00:48:53.809
being patient. We have our eyes on that big issue of Jehovah's sovereignty.

00:48:55.170 --> 00:49:02.130
See, we may not always be able to see Jehovah's hand, but we can be sure, as our text for today says,

00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:10.369
that Jehovah's hand is there and it will become known. Every year, millions of people come together at

00:49:10.369 --> 00:49:16.449
our conventions to learn about Jehovah and encourage each other. Starting next month,

00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:20.530
always rejoice conventions will be held all over the earth.

00:49:21.889 --> 00:49:27.730
Jehovah's witnesses will be actively inviting their neighbors, workmates, schoolmates, and all

00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:33.889
interested ones to join us. What effect can receiving an invitation have on a person's life?

00:49:35.010 --> 00:49:48.219
Let's watch the following report. I came to Greece as an immigrant when I was just 16 years old.

00:49:48.219 --> 00:49:55.019
Because of that, I never felt saved with people around me. At that time, I was renting an apartment

00:49:55.019 --> 00:50:02.940
from a man who was studying the Bible with one of Jehovah's witnesses. One day, I joined the study

00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:08.929
and their brother invited me to the convention. I was very cautious at the beginning,

00:50:09.969 --> 00:50:17.300
but the brothers seemed trustworthy. I always had questions about true God and I wanted to learn more

00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:26.179
about Him, so I decided to go. In 2016, I received an invitation from my son to attend the

00:50:26.179 --> 00:50:31.860
convention of Jehovah's witnesses. He was getting baptized at that convention and it was important

00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:38.260
to him for me to be there, and so he asked me to go. Even though I was very active in another

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:47.460
religion for 30 years, I went in order to please him. I learned the truth after I subplicated God

00:50:47.539 --> 00:50:53.940
with all my strength, because I was really lost. I asked for answers to questions that were yet

00:50:53.940 --> 00:51:01.380
unanswered, and God answered me. Jehovah gave me the answer to my prayers when I found this.

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:05.940
This invitation, deliverance at hand, was the answer to my prayers.

00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:14.099
Arriving there at that convention, I observed the crowd, many people starting right at the parking lot.

00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:20.980
Everything organized, people entering in an orderly manner. Inside the assembly hall,

00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:26.980
everyone was very organized, well dressed, very loving. And when the convention began,

00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:31.699
I saw such spiritual food that I had never seen in my religion.

00:51:33.139 --> 00:51:37.699
30 years in a religion, I thought I knew a lot, but I didn't know anything.

00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:40.739
So I decided to study.

00:51:42.099 --> 00:51:47.780
When I arrived at the convention, I started watching the people. Their faces were smiley.

00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:54.099
They seemed to be happy. There were men, women and children from different races and nationalities.

00:51:56.239 --> 00:52:04.880
When they sang, I could sense their true joy and unity. For the first time in my life,

00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:12.480
I felt very safe. I was not in fear of being taken advantage of. Also,

00:52:13.199 --> 00:52:21.059
what I learned at that convention drew me to the true God. I thought that if all these people

00:52:21.059 --> 00:52:27.380
are truly happy and feel really safe being part of this organization, Jehovah's organization,

00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:31.300
then indeed, that is what I was looking for.

00:52:33.699 --> 00:52:40.900
I went to the convention on Sunday. I was really warmly welcomed by all the brothers and sisters

00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:50.019
there. I listened to all the morning program. And at noon, I recognized the sound of the truth.

00:52:50.019 --> 00:52:56.659
I was sure it was the truth. I decided to become one of Jehovah's Witnesses and I became one

00:52:56.659 --> 00:53:02.739
of Jehovah's Witnesses. I got baptized in 2017 and now I serve as a pioneer.

00:53:04.099 --> 00:53:10.019
My first study was the following Wednesday. I was happy to get to know Jehovah.

00:53:10.019 --> 00:53:16.659
Now I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses. And as much as I can, I participate in the invitation

00:53:16.659 --> 00:53:24.019
campaigns. I really hope that it has many people be delivered. I started attending meetings

00:53:24.019 --> 00:53:30.099
right after the convention. I started a Bible study and eventually I got baptized as one of Jehovah's

00:53:30.099 --> 00:53:37.539
Witnesses. My mother, one of my brothers and my two sisters are now serving Jehovah's well.

00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:44.980
Later on, I got married to a faithful sister, a very good wife, and we served Jehovah together.

00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:53.059
People need to feel safe. And I know for sure that Jehovah's organization is the safest place you

00:53:53.059 --> 00:54:04.050
can be. Did you notice how the convention invitations were obtained? They were given by a relative

00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:11.329
or an associate or simply left at the door. We never know how even a single invitation can help

00:54:11.329 --> 00:54:18.530
a person come to know Jehovah. Our diligence in the invitation campaign can make a powerful

00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:25.010
difference. This month's program has helped us remember that we are precious to Jehovah.

00:54:26.289 --> 00:54:31.489
We learned that even if we had a hard start in life, we don't have to be a victim of our past.

00:54:32.210 --> 00:54:38.210
We saw how Jehovah sees us, cares for us, and provides loving help in many ways.

00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:45.010
We were reminded that Jehovah is close to the broken hearted. And that through prayer,

00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:51.809
we can unburden ourselves and receive comfort, knowing that whatever suffering we're enduring now

00:54:51.809 --> 00:54:58.130
will soon be forgotten. Let's conclude our program by visiting our brothers and sisters in Cuba.

00:54:59.650 --> 00:55:06.050
The Republic of Cuba is a chain of 1,600 islands and eyelids at the intersection of the Atlantic

00:55:06.050 --> 00:55:13.969
Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. Cuba itself is by far the largest island in the chain

00:55:14.530 --> 00:55:23.969
with one major city, Havana. Many are embracing the truth. Cuba is home to almost 95,000

00:55:23.969 --> 00:55:32.530
publishers in 1,400 congregations. They're conducting more than 135,000 Bible studies.

00:55:33.489 --> 00:55:40.449
Lush mountains and hills cover a quarter of Cuba. At the western end of the island is Minyales,

00:55:41.250 --> 00:55:47.650
famous for its tower-like hills called Mugoltes. Caves and rivers run through many of them.

00:55:48.690 --> 00:55:56.050
The Estade Minyales congregation is located in this part of Cuba. Here 128 publishers

00:55:56.130 --> 00:56:03.329
conduct 275 Bible studies. Because of its vast territory, the congregation has three groups.

00:56:04.289 --> 00:56:10.690
One group that has only seven publishers had 75 people attend last year's memorial.

00:56:11.570 --> 00:56:18.530
To cover their territory, the brothers travel long distances, sometimes by bicycle or motorcycle.

00:56:19.650 --> 00:56:24.690
They witness to people wherever they are on farms and in their homes.

00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:32.449
The brothers enjoy Christian fellowship, good coffee, and singing songs of praise to Jehovah.

00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:38.769
Our brothers and sisters in the Estade Minyales congregation send their love to the

00:56:38.769 --> 00:56:45.889
worldwide Brotherhood. From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is J.W. Broadcasting.
