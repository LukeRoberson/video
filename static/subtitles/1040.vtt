00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:07.000
Jehovah chose the young woman Mary for a difficult assignment.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.720
It was a unique assignment, one that required great faith.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:21.000
It was to care for and raise the only begotten Son of God, Jesus Christ.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.239
What an amazing privilege that was.

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:30.600
And yet it required strong faith on the part of Mary, not only because this was a

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.640
very serious responsibility that would involve quite a number of years, but

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:43.679
initially, Mary before accepting this assignment, had some concerns no doubt.

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:48.600
One of them would have been the concern with regard to the reaction of her

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.240
friends, neighbors, relatives, and, yes, of course, her fiance Joseph.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.520
After all, the angel didn't say to her, don't worry, I'll go and inform this of

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.200
all the to all the ones involved so that they don't get upset.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.959
So it was a very difficult and overwhelming assignment for Mary.

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:13.439
Can you imagine how she approached this assignment?

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.469
Well, to help us do that, let's watch this short video.

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:21.909
I was engaged to Mary Joseph.

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:29.390
I thought we would have a simple and quiet life, and then suddenly everything changed.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.909
I know that God sometimes asks us to do what is difficult, but this seemed impossible beyond

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.030
anything we could handle.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.870
But I knew I was safe in Jehovah's hands.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:48.310
If we remain loyal to Him and did our best to care for His precious Son, He would always

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.310
be loyal to us and give us what we needed.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:01.450
Yes, when we think of Mary's situation, all she was interested in was having a quiet,

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.129
simple life, then suddenly everything changed for her.

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:12.050
And it may have seemed impossible for her to be able to accept that assignment.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.009
And yet, what was her reaction?

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:20.289
Well, please, take your Bibles and turn with me to the first chapter of Luke, and verse

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:26.569
38, Luke chapter 1 and verse 38.

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.050
There we see Mary's reaction.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:37.370
Luke, Jehovah's slave girl, may it happen to me according to your declaration.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:45.009
Yes, in full faith and with humility, she accepted this difficult assignment.

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:50.650
She knew that Jehovah would be with her and that he would help her.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.210
But what was it that gave Mary such a strong faith?

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.009
Well, we get a clue if we look down in the same chapter, but verse 46.

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:04.569
So that's Luke chapter 1 and verse 46.

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:10.370
And we're not going to read the verse, but the study note associated with the verse.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.650
Notice it says, Mary's words of praise that follow in verses 46 through 55 contain well

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.969
over 20 references to or illusions to the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:29.689
These words give evidence of her spirituality and her knowledge of the Scriptures.

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:32.490
They show her appreciative attitude.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:38.789
Her words also reveal the depth of her faith as she spoke of Jehovah as a basing the

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:45.050
Hordean powerful and as helping the Lolean poor who seek to serve him.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:52.610
Yes, Mary's faith was based on her knowledge of God's Word of the Holy Scriptures that

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:59.650
she had, but it seems that she didn't have personal copies of these writings.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:06.610
Rather, she must have memorized what she heard being read at the synagogue.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.210
Isn't that amazing?

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:14.129
So Mary's heart was full of all of these expressions from the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:21.529
So much so that when she spontaneously praised Jehovah, all these expressions came out because

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:24.970
she had treasured them in her heart.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:31.930
So yes, Mary had strong faith that was based on the Holy writings, and that is what made

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.129
her qualified for this assignment.

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:38.250
Well, what about us?

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.129
How can we imitate this strong faith of Mary?

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:49.089
As we look at this dramatization, notice that although our assignments may be different,

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:55.819
we likewise lead to have that same strong faith.

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:59.100
When they first told me, I thought it must have been a mistake.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.339
I mean, me?

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:27.120
Overseer Department at an International Convention, I felt like it was just too much to handle.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.800
I remembered that I thought the same thing years ago, when I was asked to serve on a disaster

00:05:32.800 --> 00:06:14.470
relief committee, and when I served on the hospital liaison committee, actually, I've always

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:22.430
felt that way, when I've received an assignment from Jehovah.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:39.199
But what I've learned is, he's always ready to help.

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:46.600
So when Jehovah asked me to do something that seems difficult, I just remind myself,

00:06:46.600 --> 00:07:08.910
to pray, stay loyal, and have faith.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:19.100
He'll give me what I need.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.980
Did you feel sorry for that young brother?

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:27.579
First we can really understand his expressions, when they told me of the assignment, I thought

00:07:27.579 --> 00:07:29.620
it was a mistake.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.660
No doubt some of us have felt the same way at times too.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.339
But what helped this young brother?

00:07:35.339 --> 00:07:42.500
Well, he remembered how Jehovah had helped him in similar situations in the past.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:47.899
Remember how he thought back to the time when he was with the disaster committee?

00:07:47.899 --> 00:07:52.420
And there he was standing as a young man, and all these other men looking to him for

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:53.980
some direction.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.180
That was very overwhelming.

00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:02.379
And then what about when he was to make the presentation as a HLC member?

00:08:02.379 --> 00:08:06.939
Remember sitting there in a corridor by himself, and then this young woman ashes him into

00:08:06.939 --> 00:08:07.939
the room?

00:08:07.939 --> 00:08:10.100
She didn't look very friendly at all, did she?

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.660
And certainly the medical staff didn't look very friendly.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:19.540
So assignments like that can be overwhelming, but what did the young brother say?

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:26.980
He said the things that helped him were prayer, stain loyal, and having faith.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:35.460
Yes, like Mary, we likewise can have this strong faith that pleases Jehovah.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:42.340
We need to display humility and have absolute confidence in Jehovah, a type of confidence

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.259
that's expressed in the book of Psalms.

00:08:45.259 --> 00:08:53.059
Please turn with me to Psalm 56 and verses 3 and 4.

00:08:53.059 --> 00:08:57.419
Psalm 56 verses 3 and 4.

00:08:57.419 --> 00:09:04.580
When I am afraid, I put my trust in you, in God whose word I praise.

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:08.740
In God I put my trust, I am not afraid.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:13.419
What can mere men do to me?

00:09:13.419 --> 00:09:20.139
Yes, just like the psalmist and just like Mary, we can have full confidence in Jehovah.

00:09:20.139 --> 00:09:27.019
Yes, let us demonstrate this strong faith when we are faced with difficult assignments,

00:09:27.019 --> 00:09:34.139
trusting in Jehovah, knowing that he will bless us, the same as he blessed Mary.

00:09:34.139 --> 00:09:39.419
The next part in our symposium will be handled by Brother Leonard Myers, who's a helper

00:09:39.419 --> 00:09:41.659
to the writing committee.

00:09:41.659 --> 00:09:47.820
We'll discuss the theme, imitate women of strong faith, the Phoenician woman.
