00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:18.129
My first contact with witnesses was in my 20s.

00:00:18.129 --> 00:00:21.250
As my knowledge increased, I made drastic changes.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.649
I quit smoking, stopped swearing and using drugs.

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:27.089
I also changed my violent behavior.

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:33.850
I completely gave up martial arts, and then I was baptized as one of Jovo's witnesses.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:44.109
It was an amazing day that I would never forget.

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:49.390
Shortly after my baptism, I became quite involved in my work at the theatre.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.469
The environment there was very immoral, you know?

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:56.670
Even after several loving warnings from the brothers in the congregation

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.710
advising me to look for another job, I choose not to follow their advice.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.870
I'd worked there for a long time, so I thought,

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.349
I can handle it, but I was wrong.

00:01:08.349 --> 00:01:18.890
My conscience became dull, and I committed a serious sin against Jovo.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.409
When I left the truth, several officers came away.

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.250
I became a manager at a nightclub that was open until 6 in the morning.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:36.239
It was a lot of parties, and it was a lot of drugs.

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:40.659
I also received martial arts.

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.780
I came in contact with serious criminals, and gradually became friends

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.510
with the most influential person in the criminal underworld in Oslo.

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:58.400
Eventually, I was in prison for my violent behaviour.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.079
Christian movement visited the prison where I was,

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:07.560
and all of the inmates were invited to an event where they would be cake served.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.800
That sounded very interesting.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.560
I was tempted by a cake.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.319
They also played music, but after a while,

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.439
I started speaking in tongues, and I felt very uncomfortable.

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:23.319
I didn't want to be involved in that.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.439
But I couldn't get up.

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.599
Even though I was big and strong back then,

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.560
I physically couldn't stand up from my chair.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.599
I've experienced a lot in my life, but at that moment, I was genuinely scared.

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.280
So I cried out to Jovo, and immediately I was released,

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.800
and I was able to get up and leave.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.259
This big man was now in a fetal position crying.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.780
And then I called my wife and asked her to bring me a Bible and some literature.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:04.310
I had to start studying again and draw close to Jovo.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.990
The greatest challenge was prayer to start communicating with Jovo again

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.509
after being so far away from him, doing all these bad things.

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:19.699
You know, it was a long way to go.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.219
One scripture I especially remember is Isaiah 118,

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:31.539
where he says, come now, let us set matters straight between us,

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:35.180
that touch me deeply.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.539
He also says that if your sins are red like scarlet,

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:43.979
Jovo will make them white as snow.

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:49.340
It felt like he separated the darkness and stretched out his hand,

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:59.349
and pulled me out, back into the light again.

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:04.349
Six months after I was reinstated, my wife decided to dedicate her life to Jovo,

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.610
and was baptized.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:14.530
She has been a huge support during my return.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:21.050
I was very nervous at first, but when I entered the kingdom hall,

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.850
that feeling just disappeared.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.329
God's spirit is here.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.250
The way the brothers and sisters acted towards each other,

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:36.959
such a contrast to my former lifestyle,

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:42.009
we feel deeply blessed by Jovo.

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:45.649
Of course, you make mistakes once in a while,

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:51.129
but now I feel confident that Jovo is merciful.
