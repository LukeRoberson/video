00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.620
Prayer is an important thing.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.619
Everything I do, I always go to Jehovah in Prayer and ask for his guidance.

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:18.620
I was born in the 26th of March, 1923 in Panama.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:27.059
I was baptized on August 1946 at Cleveland, Ohio.

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:33.060
I've started pioneering in January of 1947,

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.060
where there are a couple of scriptures that have been most influential in my life.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.060
One in Psalm 55, 22, which says,

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.060
through your burden on Jehovah and he will sustain you,

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.060
never will he allow the righteous one to fall.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.060
One of the most trying experiences of my life

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.060
was facing the selective service board.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.060
I registered as was required by law

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:07.060
and I received a classification of 1A, fit for military service.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.060
I then spoke with the Society's Legal Department

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.060
and I was instructed to appeal the decision

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.060
because I was a regular pioneer.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.060
I had to go to the draft board

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.060
and there I was severely questioned.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.060
One of the problems they had was that I had a part-time job

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:36.060
and they felt that that interfered with my being classified as a full-time minister.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.060
However, because I was conducting about 12 Bible studies at that time,

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.060
I took copies of all those records and presented it to the board.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.060
The chairman said to me,

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.060
are you saying if we were to talk to all of these people,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.060
they would tell us that you're conducting Bible studies with them every week

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.060
and I said yes sir.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.659
While they are deliberating,

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.260
I am praying hard to hope I have done to make a proper decision.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.259
In a few days time, the classification card came as 4D.

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:15.259
I was classified as a religious minister

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:19.259
and I lift my thought to Jehovah and thank you Jehovah very much.

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:23.699
And when I was in the circuit work in Cuba,

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:27.699
I had a few encounters with soldiers.

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:31.699
It's difficult to understand the tense atmosphere

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:33.699
that existed back in those days,

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:39.699
the freedom that those rivers had with shooting people and even participants people.

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:42.699
They didn't have a second thought.

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:46.699
I had just got through serving a congregation in the hills

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:50.699
and we took the local bus that ran around that area

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:55.699
and on the highway, two soldiers stopped the bus

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:57.699
and ordered all men to come off.

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:00.699
They started looking at each of us one by one,

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:03.699
sending everybody back on the bus and they looked at me and said,

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:04.699
you, stay there.

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:06.699
Pointing the rifle at me and said,

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:07.699
who are you?

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:09.699
I explained myself,

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:11.699
but they kept pointing the rifle.

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:14.699
One of the soldiers said to the driver,

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:17.699
take off, but that's when you pray hard

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:19.699
and you remember the scripture,

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.699
Proverbs 29, 25,

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:24.699
trembling at men is a snare,

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:29.699
but the one trusting in Jehovah will be protected.

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:33.699
So the driver said, no, he's a circuit over syrup.

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:36.699
He rides with me out of one and he really defended me

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:41.699
and makes me believe that Jehovah's Angels intervene.

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:44.699
And that's why I said,

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:46.699
I am a slave to prayer.

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:50.699
It's the most important thing in my life.

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:53.699
When I came back to the United States,

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:56.699
I was being used by the service department

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:58.699
in the full-time work.

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:00.699
A few years later,

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:05.699
I had to give up the full-time work and take care of my family.

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:08.699
The adjustment I had to make to a family man

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:12.699
was hard because most of my life was occupied

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:14.699
in full-time service.

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:20.009
But I had to leave matters in Jehovah's hands.

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:25.009
We started the prison ministry around May of 1974.

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:27.009
It gives you a measure of satisfaction

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:34.009
and seeing how the Bible has a very strong influence on individual.

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:38.009
To see criminals turn their life completely wrong,

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:40.009
the Bible changes lives.

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:45.009
And that's why pioneering has always been in my heart.

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.009
And so after my wife died,

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:50.009
I felt that the proper thing to do

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.009
was to get back into the full-time service.

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:58.009
And as a result of that, I started pioneering again in 1998.

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:01.009
Jehovah God has been good to me

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.009
and at my age of 96,

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:05.009
I thank Jehovah every day

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.009
for the health and strength he promised me to enjoy.

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:11.009
And I keep on going.
