00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:09.990
How will you feel when all we came here to do is finally completed?

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.310
No doubt we will find a moment to reflect on the words of Philippians chapter 2 and verse

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.310
13.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:22.190
Yes, Drahova energised us and gave each and every one of us both the desire and the power

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.829
to act.

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:29.829
How has sharing on this project affected your life?

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:48.460
It all started over seven years ago.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.140
Can you imagine how excited you're going to be when we hear that the new branch facility

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.219
at Chelmsford has been approved by the City Council?

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:59.820
Well guess what?

00:00:59.820 --> 00:03:33.300
Yesterday afternoon we received the approval.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.099
Whilst the buildings are beautiful, at the end of the day they are just buildings.

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:44.180
The really special part of this project has been the people.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.300
Even non-witnesses saw that something special was taking place on our side.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.500
It's a very friendly state to work on.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.099
It's just our friendly one.

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:55.300
It's all keen.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.060
I find it mind-blowing.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.819
In a negative, sometimes society, when you come here, it just puts a smile on your face.

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.699
A truly unexpected success was the visitor centre.

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:10.500
How we underestimated the appreciation

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.340
Jehovah's people have for theocratic activities.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:21.350
Visitors from all around the globe witness the activities of Jehovah for themselves.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.629
This is partly why I'm actually studying the Bible to get baptized.

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:31.930
Because when I came here, just hit me somewhere.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.370
Me and Alicia can't see, so everyone's been so encouraging and thoughtful.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.089
We really feel like Jehovah's with us and he supported us.

00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:49.209
I really liked the ladies driving tractor.

00:04:49.209 --> 00:04:52.170
Everyone wanted to have a part in the project.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:59.860
Every single contribution warmed our hearts and sometimes our heads too.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.899
Another beautiful project highlight was the day volunteer programme.

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:09.939
The effort and expense brothers and sisters sacrificed reminded all of us

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:14.259
what that privilege it is to work for Jehovah.

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:17.300
And how about the commuters who helped on the project?

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:24.860
Would the BRD family have had the same spirit without our commuters?

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:32.379
Don't you just love being a part of this amazing family?

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:39.019
We will regularly remind it that spirituality is of the utmost importance.

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:43.740
Did you ever say that a monthly meeting was the best one yet?

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.899
What lies outside the comfort zone is the faith zone.

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:56.379
Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened.

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:58.860
What is your story?

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.620
The centre of all of our stories is Jehovah.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.420
He is the one who energised us.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:10.540
He is the one who gave us both the desire and the power to act.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.699
He is the one we can thank for the lifelong friendships we have formed,

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:19.819
the training we have received and the challenges we've been able to overcome.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.339
Remember your story.

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:26.540
Really, it's only just beginning.
