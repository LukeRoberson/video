00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.500
As was shown in the first century, many who are rightly disposed for everlasting life are becoming believers.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.500
This truly is the case in the countries of Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.500
The work in these three countries is cared for by the branch offices in Argentina and Paraguay.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.500
Faith and I had the privilege of visiting these branches on a branch visit in March 2018.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.500
Both branches have beautiful Bethel families who are working hard to support the activity in the field.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.500
Among the work taking place, these branches take care for the translation of spiritual food into 11 languages.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.500
They are also busy building, renovating, and maintaining kingdom walls and caring for the needs of the congregations.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:01:00.500
In Argentina, a new branch facility is being built to help further simplify the work of the branch so that even more attention can be given to the field.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.500
11 brothers serve on the branch committee in Argentina and 6 brothers serve on the branch committee in Paraguay.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:15.500
These loyal and faithful men are working hard to support the governing body and they are looking for ways to find even more who want to learn about Jehovah.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.500
The result of their hard work in Jehovah's Blessing is most evident.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:29.500
In 2017, over 200% of the 173,000 publishers in these three countries attended the memorial.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.500
In the past 10 years, over 55,000 persons have been baptized.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.500
That is the equivalent of 15 persons baptized every day of the week for the past 10 years.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.500
There is also a fine zeal for the preaching work.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:54.500
Just in the last year alone, the number of pioneers increased by about 16%, and nearly 2.8 million more hours were put in the ministry.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:03.500
Both branches have organized special preaching campaigns to reach those in unassigned territories or to reach indigenous populations.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.500
These initiatives have had much success.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:14.500
For the first time, publications were translated into Niva Clay, a language spoken by a sizable indigenous population.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:21.500
To distribute the literature, a campaign was organized in the Northern Territory of Paraguay called El Chaco.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.500
In one location, the brothers talked with the head of the community, and he was very happy to see publications in his own language.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.500
When he saw one of our videos in Niva Clay, he started to cry.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:40.500
He called his entire family to watch the video, and asked for a Bible study for him and his family.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:48.500
When the brothers asked if they could have a meeting in the community, he agreed and even offered to invite all the people to the meeting.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.500
One brother who shared in the campaign to work unassigned and seldom worked territory in Paraguay wrote,

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:02.500
people showed so much interest in the good news that it was very difficult to end conversations and go to another house.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.500
In some places, people spread the news of their visits by word of mouth.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:15.500
So when our brothers and sisters arrived in a territory, they found that many householders already had prepared chairs waiting for them to arrive.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:23.500
Some householders invited them for lunch, offered lodging, and even offered part of their property to build a meeting place.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:33.500
A man who was the owner of a little store was enjoying what he was hearing about the kingdom message so much that when some customers arrived to shop, he told them,

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.500
now I'm very busy, if you need something, come back later.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:51.939
In Buenos Aires, Argentina, one afternoon while in the ministry, two sisters approached a house that was listed in the territory records as a possible address for a Romani Calderas speaker.

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:55.939
A 14-year-old Romani girl ran out to them and asked,

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:57.939
are you Jehovah's Witnesses?

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:03.939
When they replied that they were, she exclaimed, Jehovah sent you.

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:08.939
She explained that she was from the southernmost tip of South America.

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:16.939
She'd been studying the Bible with her neighbor, but her family was very opposed and took her Bible and Bible teach book away.

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:23.939
Even so, she would secretly sneak away three times a week to meet her neighbor and continue her Bible study.

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:38.939
When her family found out that she was still studying, they decided to send her about 3,000 kilometers or 1,800 miles away to Buenos Aires so that she would not be able to contact the witness she was studying with anymore.

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:51.939
When her Bible teacher heard that she was being sent far away, she wrote a letter to the young girl, saying that no matter where she ended up, she should keep praying to Jehovah and try to find the witnesses.

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:58.939
After relating the story, the young girl asked, were you sent by my teacher or were you just preaching from house to house?

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:04.939
The sisters replied, saying they were preaching in the area looking for Romani Calderas speakers.

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:08.939
They then asked the girl, how long she had been at Buenos Aires.

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:14.939
She said, I arrived today. What I just told you happened today.

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:19.939
I left this morning and after arriving here, I started to pray to Jehovah.

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:23.939
When I opened my eyes, I saw you standing at my door.

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:27.939
Arrangements were made to follow up on her interest.

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:34.939
In Argentina, the branch reached a milestone in the witchy language by translating the become Jehovah's friend videos.

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:37.939
The response was beyond expectations.

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:43.939
Children and adults alike were amazed to see the characters speaking in their native tongue.

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:52.939
As a result of this project, the witchy people feel that they are not forgotten by Jehovah, and this helped their love for him grow even more.

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:57.939
Even those in prison are being reached with the good news and are taking a stand for the truth.

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:01.939
Consider the experience of Jesus' wicked.

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:04.939
Formerly, he was considered a dangerous inmate.

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:08.939
In fact, the prison kept him guarded by a whole security team.

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:12.939
Yet others now view him as completely the opposite.

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:18.939
Brother Wicked is serving a 50-year sentence of which he is now in his sixth year.

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:23.939
Last May, he went through what was probably the biggest test of his faith yet.

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:32.939
His former friends proposed the idea where through some illegal means he could get out of prison and do the rest of his time in home custody.

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:36.939
Making the right decision was very difficult for Brother Wicked.

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:43.939
As this would have meant that he could be with his beloved family, some of whom were also witnesses.

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:50.939
After consulting with his family with many tears, he decided to serve out the rest of his sentence at prison,

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:57.939
giving a great witness to his former friends, now witness family members, and all of the prison inmates.

00:06:57.939 --> 00:07:02.939
He gave up his freedom to put his relationship with Jehovah first.

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:06.939
Jesus has found joy even despite his current circumstances.

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:11.939
He conducts six Bible studies and witnesses from cell to cell.

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:20.939
In one of the general areas of the prison, he displays the publications during the visitation days for the families of the inmates, with very positive results.

00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:31.259
It was so encouraging to see the outstanding young brothers and sisters in these countries and their desire to do more for Jehovah.

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:38.259
Many are learning new languages, going to the school for Kingdom Evangelizers, reaching out for Bethel Servers,

00:07:38.259 --> 00:07:44.259
and working with their local design construction department to help build, renovate, and maintain Kingdom Halls.

00:07:44.259 --> 00:07:49.259
This is Leandro Tamala on the left and Ari Navarro on the right.

00:07:49.259 --> 00:07:54.259
Ari was part of a family that was truly passionate for football or soccer.

00:07:54.259 --> 00:07:58.259
It was Ari's dream to be part of the national team someday.

00:07:58.259 --> 00:08:03.259
Ari excelled at the sport and received offers from two national football teams.

00:08:03.259 --> 00:08:08.259
This was an especially tempting offer because these were his two favorite teams.

00:08:08.259 --> 00:08:17.259
Even though it was a hard decision for him because of his passion for the sport, he had already decided to serve Jehovah and he turned down the offers.

00:08:17.259 --> 00:08:21.259
Leandro had a similar test but with a different sport.

00:08:21.259 --> 00:08:29.259
Leandro excelled at basketball and received an offer to play for the national team, which included a chance to play internationally.

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:33.259
He realized that he could not serve two masters.

00:08:33.259 --> 00:08:40.259
After watching the video, young people asked what will I do with my life, he made the decision to serve Jehovah.

00:08:40.259 --> 00:08:44.259
Both of these young men served together at the branch in Argentina.

00:08:44.259 --> 00:08:50.259
They feel that the decisions they have made have brought them so much happiness and fulfillment in life.

00:08:50.259 --> 00:08:55.259
They say that they are receiving much more satisfaction than a life in sports would have ever provided.

00:08:55.259 --> 00:09:02.259
These are just a few of the many experiences of the outstanding brothers and sisters serving in these countries.

00:09:02.259 --> 00:09:10.259
In addition to organizing the work in the field, the members of the branch committee and Bethel families are themselves active in the field ministry.

00:09:10.259 --> 00:09:17.259
While on the visit we had the opportunity to engage in the ministry in both countries with them and had a very encouraging time.

00:09:17.259 --> 00:09:24.259
Additionally, we had the privilege of having two meetings with a combined attendance of nearly 200,000.

00:09:24.259 --> 00:09:34.259
We were greatly encouraged by hearing reports of the work in these countries and were reminded of the privilege we have to be part of this incredible organization.

00:09:34.259 --> 00:09:45.259
The many brothers and sisters in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay counted a privilege to work with you shoulder to shoulder in helping all those who are streaming to the House of Jehovah.

00:09:45.259 --> 00:09:54.259
Like you, they are joyfully keeping busy in the exciting work going on in our branches and in the field in these last days.
