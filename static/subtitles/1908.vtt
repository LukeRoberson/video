00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:09.500
Welcome! What an exciting time! The memorial season is here, and the invitation campaign

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:16.100
is underway. And with the new hour requirements for pioneers, many of us can now share in

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.039
the pioneer work. We've received so many cards and letters from brothers and sisters

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.440
who are thrilled with the new hour requirements for pioneers.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.679
One sister wrote,

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:36.640
As a mother, wife, homemaker, part-time worker, and caretaker for elderly parents,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.719
you have absolutely no idea what the update did for me today. I have tears even as I am

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.520
writing. We are all so tired right now, but want nothing more than to faithfully serve

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.520
Jehovah and stay active in reaching people in these last days.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:02.880
The announcement to reduce the pioneer hours was such an answer to prayers. It was so faith-strengthening,

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.959
and a complete reassurance of Jehovah's love for all of us. Thank you so much.

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:11.959
Another sister wrote,

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:17.280
I just wanted to take a minute to tell you how happy I was to get the new information

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:25.400
on auxiliary pioneer hours. I cried. I have kidney dialysis three times a week.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:35.879
It takes a lot of my strength, but 15 hours, I can do that. What a wonderful God we have.

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:40.480
These messages no doubt reflect the thoughts and feelings of many of you dear brothers and

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:47.859
sisters, and isn't it encouraging that since January 1st, 2023, theocratic schools have

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:56.000
resumed in person. Worldwide, more than 430 classes of the school for kingdom evangelizers

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.879
and more than 170 classes of the school for circuit overseers and their wives have been

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:08.919
approved for this next year. Additionally, elders have begun attending in-person classes

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:17.439
of the school for congregation elders. We pray for Jehovah's rich blessing on these arrangements.

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:22.479
We have another exciting announcement. We are very pleased to inform you that beginning

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:31.680
June 1st, 2023, tours of many Bethel facilities will resume worldwide in accord with local circumstances.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.560
Initially, for health and safety reasons, the number of persons permitted to tour Bethel

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.800
will be considerably reduced. If no significant difficulties are encountered, the number

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:51.599
of persons permitted to tour Bethel will gradually be increased. The local branch office will

00:02:51.599 --> 00:03:00.900
provide further details on this matter later this month. Since our last update, we received

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:09.139
a very exciting announcement. On January 18th, 2023, brothers Gage Flegal and Jeffrey

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:15.219
Winder were appointed to serve as members of the governing body. We're happy to have them

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:21.139
with us here in the studio, and we'd like to spend a few minutes together so you can get to know

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:29.919
them a bit. Well, brothers, we understand that you were both raised in the truth by your Christian

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:37.120
parents. So what helped you to come to love Jehovah and want to serve him? Jeff will start with you.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.319
Having parents that were well grounded in the truth really did make a big difference to help us

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:51.039
children choose to write path. And we always knew and loved the truth, but as I got older,

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:58.400
particularly in my mid-teen years, the truth really became more personal and more real to me.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.639
It's almost like it kind of went from black and white to color as it became more personal in that

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:11.120
way. And the district convention in 1985, as it was then called, had a deep impact on me,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:18.480
particularly the baptism talk, and the concluding talk really spoke to me. And I could tell I was just

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.040
beginning to make the truth my own during that time. So by the following year, beginning of the

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.439
calendar year, I dedicated my life to Jehovah and got baptized. Very nice. Thank you, Brother

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:34.319
Winter, for sharing that. Gage, we'll ask you the same question. Get your thoughts on it.

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:42.319
Well, as was true with Jeff, home was fertile soil for my brothers and my sister and me to

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:50.399
grow spiritually. Both of my parents were living examples of faith. My father took advantage of

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.199
opportunities to teach us about creation and what this revealed about Jehovah's qualities,

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:01.759
his personality. I have precious memories of getting up early and watching the sunrise with him.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.879
My mom, she started regular pioneering when I was 11 years old and has continued to this day.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:16.879
Her constant example of putting Jehovah first was definitely made a deep impression in my mind.

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:21.120
And I was able to join her in the regular pioneer ministry, my senior year of high school,

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.879
until I was able to go to Bethel. Well, what nice comments, brothers. We want to know more.

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:32.800
So here's another question. What motivated you to pursue full-time service and Bethel service?

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.800
And, Jeff, please. For me, a good association had a, played a big role.

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:44.959
As it turned out, at the circuit assembly that I got baptized, several other young brothers

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:50.959
from our congregation got baptized as well. And at the end of that assembly, it occurred to us that

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:55.199
we could auxiliary pioneer now. And so we decided to do it the very next month.

00:05:55.839 --> 00:06:00.720
And we loved it so much. We pioneered the following month and all through that summer.

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:06.399
And by then we were hooked. We loved it. And three of us went directly into regular pioneering from

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:13.439
there. And for Bethel service, my two older brothers served at Walkill before me when I was just

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:19.040
a teenager. And we had an opportunity to visit while they were there and just seeing Bethel

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.600
and seeing all that took place there really instilled in me the desire to want to serve

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:30.639
Bethel when I became old enough. Very good. Engaged what motivated you? Well, full-time service

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:38.639
was the right thing to do. To me, dedication to Jehovah and serving him in the fullest capacity

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:44.720
possible, go hand in hand. So that was always the, the goal that my parents had set before us.

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:48.399
We always had special full-time servants that would stay at the house,

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:54.480
circled over seers, Bethel family members. They would stay and seeing their joy is something

00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:00.959
that motivated me along those lines as well. At age 12, I was able to attend a Bethel meeting

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:05.680
at the regional convention back at that time. And so it became crystallized in my mind that

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.000
that's the direction I wanted to go. Very good. Well, you started at a very young age having an

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.279
interest in Bethel service. That's delightful to see. Third question for you? What have been some

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:23.920
of your assignments at Bethel? And how have you benefited from them, Jeff? Well, I began Bethel

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:30.800
and my first assignment was in the cleaning department. And for me, starting Bethel service in

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:36.959
cleaning was an excellent way to start because Bethel can really teach you some very valuable

00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:43.439
qualities like obedience and patience and humility. And starting off in a support department

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:47.920
like cleaning, I felt like it really gave me a good head start in developing these qualities

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:53.839
that would be useful the rest of my life. After that, I was transferred to the farm department.

00:07:53.839 --> 00:08:00.480
And I worked in what was like produce processing at Walkill. And again, it's a lot of fun. Good

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:05.120
brothers and sisters that we worked their spiritual men and women. A lot of hard work, but one

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.360
that I thoroughly enjoyed. And it was about three years that I worked in that department.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:17.439
And then I was transferred to the office. And that began a period of about 22 years of serving as

00:08:17.439 --> 00:08:25.439
a secretary for various brothers and various aspects of the work there at Walkill. And during that time,

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:31.759
I had the privilege to work along with brothers that had served Jehovah for years, had deep experience

00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:37.519
and wisdom and knowledge and how to administer the work at Bethel. And that really molded me and

00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:44.559
taught me things that I drew on in future assignments. And I continue to draw on today. And of course,

00:08:44.559 --> 00:08:48.639
during that time, you and I had the privilege to work together for about 10 years in the Bethel office.

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:55.279
In 2016, I had quite a surprise when we were transferred to Patterson. And I was asked to work

00:08:55.279 --> 00:09:01.600
with Audio Video Services Department. And I knew nothing about making videos or audio products.

00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:06.480
But the brothers and sisters there were so patient with me, answered all my questions. And in

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:13.200
time, then I began to learn the work and really began to come to love it and enjoy it. A very

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:18.720
interesting work, but such a huge privilege to contribute to the production of spiritual food.

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:24.399
And I really came to love the brothers and sisters in that department. And then in 2020,

00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:29.600
another big surprise when I was asked to transfer, we were asked to transfer to Warwick. And I was

00:09:30.399 --> 00:09:36.639
asked to work in the personal committee office again with just a solid group of very skilled and

00:09:36.639 --> 00:09:40.960
devoted brothers in that office that I've thoroughly enjoyed. Well, thank you, Jeff, for going

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:45.759
through that background with us. We enjoyed hearing that. And Gage, not for you, what have been

00:09:45.759 --> 00:09:50.720
some of your assignments and the benefits that have come from that? Well, I started working in the

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:56.720
binary. I worked at the binary for eight years. And that taught me the value of being punctual,

00:09:57.759 --> 00:10:02.720
working hard and getting the job done, even if it was very hot. Conditions weren't always the best.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:10.559
And also the value of working with people of different backgrounds, different cultures,

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.600
completely different from what I was accustomed to and working together in unity and peace.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:21.120
Then I was transferred to the service department, an office environment, completely different

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:27.360
from the binary. But I learned there the importance of getting all the facts before commenting on

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:34.320
a matter, the importance of many advisors consulting with different brothers before sending

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:41.200
direction out. And also the practical value of Jehovah's word, whether it's a personal issue,

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.720
whether it's a family issue, whether it's a congregation issue, Jehovah's word is practical in

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:54.320
all of those scenarios. And then in 2015, I was asked to work with the teaching committee office.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:11:03.279
And there I learned that not simply preparing delightful words for the international brotherhood,

00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:10.480
but also the importance of accurate words, preparing that for the brotherhood. And seeing Jehovah's

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:18.960
spirit make sure that the completed project came about. Thank you very much, Gage. We enjoyed hearing

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:23.200
that background from both of you brothers and how you've benefited from it. But we're going to

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:28.399
bring it right now back to the scriptures. And this thought is there a scriptural thought that

00:11:28.399 --> 00:11:33.600
is strengthened you as you begin this new assignment. And Jeff will start with you again.

00:11:34.639 --> 00:11:40.960
There is. In recent weeks and months, we've really come to hang on a couple of verses in Isaiah 26.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:48.320
And particularly with this assignment, I know that I could not accomplish this assignment on my own.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.919
And there's been moments of feeling a bit overwhelmed. But here in Isaiah 26,

00:11:54.799 --> 00:11:57.279
there's so reassuring from Jehovah. Verse 12 says,

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:05.039
Oh, Jehovah, you will grant us peace because everything we have done, you have accomplished for us.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:10.000
I feel like Jehovah is just reassuring me that you're not going to have to do it on your own.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:16.399
That Jehovah would help me. And I love that it's in the past tense. Everything we have done,

00:12:16.399 --> 00:12:23.360
you have accomplished because we have history with Jehovah. I've seen him specifically helping me

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:28.240
in past assignments to accomplish things that I knew I couldn't have done on my own, but Jehovah helped.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:35.279
And so then that reassures me. And as the verse says, it gives me peace. And in verse 3, it develops

00:12:35.279 --> 00:12:41.759
that even further. It says, you will safeguard those who fully lean on you. You will give them

00:12:41.759 --> 00:12:48.799
continuous peace because it is in you that they trust. So this connection between trusting in

00:12:48.799 --> 00:12:55.279
Jehovah fully leaning on him and having continuous peace. So if I've had those moments where I

00:12:55.279 --> 00:13:01.279
begin to feel a bit anxious or overwhelmed, this scripture comes to mind, don't forget fully

00:13:01.279 --> 00:13:06.559
lean on Jehovah. Jehovah is going to do the job. And then that peace can resume.

00:13:07.039 --> 00:13:11.519
Beautiful set of scriptures there to share with us. We appreciate that. Brother Flagle,

00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:19.840
same question for you. I also have two verses. The first one is Mark 1436. Jesus words on the night

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:25.440
before his death. He said to his father in prayer, not what I want, but what you want.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:34.159
So my wife and I are a bit shy and reserved. So this is not the assignment that we

00:13:34.159 --> 00:13:40.720
naturally would prefer, but our life is not our own. And Jehovah guides us our steps according

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:50.000
to his will. And then the other other verses found in Isaiah chapter 41 verse 10, comforting words

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:57.679
from Jehovah. Do not be afraid for I am with you. Do not be anxious for I am your God. I will

00:13:57.679 --> 00:14:04.480
fortify you. Yes, I will help you. So it's comforting to know that Jehovah doesn't expect

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:10.399
more of us than we're able to accomplish with his help. So that's definitely comforting as we're

00:14:10.399 --> 00:14:14.879
moving forward in this assignment. Well, great scriptural thoughts, Gage. Thank you very

00:14:14.879 --> 00:14:19.200
much for sharing those and both of you brothers for sharing all of your comments with us.

00:14:19.759 --> 00:14:26.000
We love having you on the governing body. And we wish you Jehovah's rich blessing on your

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:34.230
new assignment. It's wonderful to see Jehovah's people busier than ever in Kingdom work.

00:14:34.789 --> 00:14:40.149
We know this memorial season will be filled with joyful activity as we search for honest

00:14:40.149 --> 00:14:46.309
hearted ones in the ministry. May Jehovah richly bless each of you dear brothers and sisters.

00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:53.590
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is J. W. Broadcasting.
