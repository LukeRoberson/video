00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:17.219
I am no part of the world, but is the world a part of me?

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:24.219
I'm pressured every day to get involved in political issues that affect me socially.

00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:50.240
Environmentally and economically.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.240
That pressure could rob me of my peace of mind.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.960
And influence how I think.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.959
I could take sides in my heart even if I'm not aware of it.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:18.450
But I know that Jehovah will care for all of mankind's concerns.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:51.480
By means of His kingdom ruled by His Son, Jesus Christ.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:58.359
I show my support for Him in my prayers.

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:02.609
In how I think and feel.

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:17.180
And by teaching others what the kingdom will do for mankind.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.180
I know there are millions of brothers and sisters all over the world.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.180
Who lawyerly support the prince of peace just like me.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.180
Because I.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.419
I.

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:37.060
I am no part of the world.
