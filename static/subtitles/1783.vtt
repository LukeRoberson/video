00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.580
World War II was going on, getting worse and worse.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:19.940
We got the evacuation notice and we had to leave.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.539
People were terrible things to people.

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.839
We were afraid.

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:39.939
No matter where you looked, there were really possessions, material things.

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:44.939
And everybody threw more things and nobody picked anything up.

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:52.729
But they cared where things that would save their life at the moment, something to eat.

00:00:52.729 --> 00:01:00.350
I really didn't know how I would spend my life at that time, right?

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:07.349
But I knew that I would not use it to get rich, to work and work for what.

00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:13.299
I wasn't dedicated to Jova at that time.

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.299
Even so, I knew Jova wasn't afraid to him.

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.299
And I'm sure he helped us.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.760
In 1946, we found out my father was alive, my sister was alive.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.760
We were very privileged to be united as a family.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.760
And at that time, my father was near Berlin.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.760
And so we started all over again.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:48.760
My father, he found the book, The Heart of God, and started to study the Bible with my sister and myself.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:56.900
And little by little, he started a congregation at our house.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:04.900
Now, coming to know Jova, learning about the paradise, I wanted to tell people about it.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.860
I knew I would have a purpose in life.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.860
I heard about Gilead, and he said, oh boy, that's where I want to go.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:21.669
I want to be a missionary, tell the people about the paradise.

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:28.669
The official ban on the waitresses in the eastern zone of Germany came in 1950.

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:33.669
But months before, we were already being observed.

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:38.669
My father got literature for the congregation.

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:44.669
Many times he would send me on a bicycle through the forest with a literature.

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:50.669
So it's interesting, when you're in that situation, you might go to prison.

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:52.669
You would just don't worry about it.

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:54.669
You'd trust in Jova.

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:56.669
And you'd just go ahead.

00:02:56.669 --> 00:03:01.169
And that's what our family did.

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:07.169
Then my father went to the branch, and they told him, Max, they said, assembly in Berlin.

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:14.169
And if you come, don't bring a Bible, don't bring a song, or book, bring nothing.

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:22.169
So when my father came back from that meeting, he told us, and he said, well, if we go, it looks like we can't come back.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.900
So I said, I'm going.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.900
And my mother said, I'm going.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.900
So we all made up a mind we would go.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.900
That means we would get prepared to leave everything again, right?

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.900
So I just put one dress on top of the other, took the bicycle and I'll be right.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:57.759
Shortly after we left, a police car came and they looked for us.

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:04.759
It was a special arrangement and privilege to be at a convention in Berlin.

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:14.900
So we all thanked Jova that we were there to listen to and be strengthened that spiritual food.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:25.899
And after the convention, we were recognized as refugees, got out on a plane to West Germany.

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:33.899
My father said, well, now here, for the second time, we lost all the material things we had in Germany here.

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:39.899
So we better immigrate to the United States, where my sister was, that we all would be together.

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:45.420
And I said, good, I get close to Gilead.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:51.420
And then I was privileged to attend the 29th class of Gilead.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.420
And my assignment was Brazil.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.279
And it was like paradise.

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:06.560
And there I met my husband who was my circuit overseer.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.560
And so I was privileged to travel with him.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.560
That was a great, great blessing.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.819
Oh, money can pay for the blessings I hear.

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:27.839
Life is the most important thing there is because no matter how much you have, you can't prolong your life.

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:34.839
And then learning about Jova who gave his son to save us from all the terrible things.

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:41.500
Why wouldn't you use your life to serve him?

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.500
Trust in Jova.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.500
And do what you can do to serve him from your heart.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.500
He will never leave you.
