00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.949
Our audience needs to see the connection between the scriptures that we read and the point we're making.

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.350
We can accomplish this when we introduce a scripture in a way that draws attention to the main point,

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.350
and then emphasize keywords as we read the text.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:33.350
But that's not always enough for the audience to grasp the application of the scripture.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:41.350
Therefore, after reading the text, it's important to offer an explanation even if the scripture is familiar to the audience.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:51.350
We can make the application clear by isolating keywords, by explaining how those words relate to our reason for feeding the text,

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.350
and by not complicating the application with irrelevant details.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:07.700
To illustrate, see if you can discern where the following speaker succeeds and where he fails in making scripture application clear.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.700
Today, many churches baptized people by sprinkling water on them.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.700
Is this how baptisms should be done?

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:22.700
Let's read how Jesus was baptized according to Mark 1, verse 9 and 10.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.700
Look for the answer to this question.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.700
When Jesus was baptized, was he sprinkled with water?

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.840
In the course of those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan by John.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:51.120
And immediately on coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens being parted and, like a dove, the spirit coming down upon him.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.120
Another popular practice in Christendom is infant baptism.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.120
Wait, the speaker just moved on to the next point.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:09.120
He had a good introduction, and he read with proper emphasis, but he took no time to make the application.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:15.120
He didn't give the audience time to reflect on the meaning of what they just read.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.120
Let's give him another chance.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:30.120
And immediately on coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens being parted and, like a dove, the spirit coming down upon him.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.120
Notice that verse 10 says that Jesus came up out of the water.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.120
That means that he had been completely immersed in the river.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.120
So Jesus was not merely sprinkled with water, was he?

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.120
Because Christians tried to follow Jesus steps closely.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:59.560
Wouldn't it be reasonable that Christian baptism would entail complete immersion and not mere sprinkling?

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.560
Another popular practice in Christendom is infant baptism.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.560
Notice that the speaker did not comment on unrelated details of the verses he read.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:18.560
For example, he didn't elaborate on the end of verse 10 because it didn't contribute to the main point.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:29.560
Whether you're teaching from the platform or in the ministry, help your listeners to see clearly the connection between the Scripture you read and the point you're making.
