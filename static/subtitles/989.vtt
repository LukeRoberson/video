00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:08.529
Jehovah is the great healer. Only He can make the promise. No resident will say,

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:14.929
I am sick. Why can we be confident that Jehovah is going to keep his promise to bring

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.929
an end to all sickness? We find assurance in the words of Isaiah

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:28.329
chapter 35 verses 5 and 6. Please open your Bibles to that Scripture. Here we read a promise

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:34.810
of healing that Jehovah made to the nation of Israel. This promise gives us hope, because

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:41.170
it was actually fulfilled on a small scale more than 2,500 years ago.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:50.969
Isaiah chapter 35 verses 5 and 6 reads. At that time, the eyes of the blind will be opened,

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.289
and the ears of the deaf will be unstopped. At that time, the lame will leap like the

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:02.770
deer, and the tongue of the speechless will shout for joy. For waters will burst forth in the

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:12.689
wilderness and streams in the desert plain. Isaiah recorded this promise 125 years before the

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:19.810
Babylonian army destroyed Jerusalem. It was fulfilled after Jehovah freed the Israelites from

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:28.370
Babylonian captivity in 537 BCE and restored them to their homeland in Israel. But you may ask,

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:38.209
were the blind, deaf, lame, and speechless really healed at that time? To answer, we need to

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:46.930
apply a basic principle. Jehovah restores what was lost. During the 70 years of exile,

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.569
Jehovah did not punish the Israelites by striking them with physical blindness,

00:01:51.569 --> 00:02:00.290
deafness, lameness, and loss of speech. Therefore, their restoration would not require the healing

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:08.530
of their physical disabilities. However, these afflictions are a good description of the

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:15.810
self-inflicted spiritual sickness that had caused the nation to fall into apostasy and lose Jehovah's

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:24.129
favor. Jehovah saw their repentant attitude and their desire to restore true worship in Jerusalem.

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:31.650
He healed their spiritual sickness by forgiving their sins and restoring them to his favor.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:40.050
In other words, they came to their spiritual senses. They regained their spiritual vision

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:49.330
and their ability to hear, obey, and speak Jehovah's word. No longer spiritually lame,

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:58.740
they were energized to carry on Jehovah's pure worship. Similarly today, we are eyewitnesses.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.580
Yes, we are the beneficiaries of a worldwide spiritual healing program.

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:11.860
Jehovah heals us spiritually by freeing us from false religious teachings and unclean practices.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:19.939
He has brought us into a spiritual paradise where our spiritual strength is renewed day by day.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:28.419
In a spiritual sense, the blind are learning to see and the deaf are learning to hear.

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.090
But is spiritual healing the only part of the fulfillment of Jehovah's promise?

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.889
No. Please open your Bibles to Isaiah chapter 33 and verse 24.

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:49.009
As we read this verse, pay attention to the latter part because it contains the key

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:56.050
to understanding why physical healing is included in God's promise. No resident will say,

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.569
I am sick. Isaiah chapter 33 verse 24 says,

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:10.210
and no resident will say, I am sick, the people dwelling in the land will be pardoned for their error.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:19.009
Did you notice that the end of sickness is related to our being pardoned for our errors or sins?

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.129
Clearly, that ties the fulfillment to a spiritual healing.

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:32.290
However, our imperfect sinful condition is also the reason that we get physically sick.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:40.370
Therefore, in the new world, on the basis of the healing power of Jesus' ransom sacrifice,

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.370
we will experience a healing of our physical sicknesses.

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:53.569
Jehovah's promise that no resident will say, I am sick, will come true in the complete sense.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.339
As you watch the following video, think about the spiritual blessings we enjoy now

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:09.339
and imagine what our lives will be like in the future when all our physical ailments will be healed.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:06:03.470
True freedom. The spiritual health we enjoy now reminds us that perfect physical and mental health

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:37.970
await us in paradise. Imagine waking every day, feeling clean, healthy, happy

00:06:39.970 --> 00:07:02.509
and full of the joy of life. Jehovah promises, no resident will say, I am sick.

00:07:09.329 --> 00:07:15.329
How refreshing and heartwarming to think of the global healing that lies ahead.

00:07:16.209 --> 00:07:22.769
We are confident that this is going to happen. Why? Because we have already experienced

00:07:22.769 --> 00:07:29.649
how Jehovah has healed us spiritually. Keep in mind the powerful statement from the video.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:38.610
The spiritual health we enjoy now reminds us that perfect physical and mental health await us

00:07:39.009 --> 00:07:47.089
in paradise. We also learned from the video that clear instruction from Jehovah draws us close to

00:07:47.089 --> 00:07:55.649
him and helps us to maintain our spiritual health today. What a blessing it is to be taught by

00:07:55.649 --> 00:08:03.410
Jehovah. We can show our appreciation for this spiritual healing by thanking Jehovah in prayer.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:12.129
Psalm 40 verse 5 mentions another way we can thank the great healer for all he has done and will do

00:08:12.129 --> 00:08:17.649
for us. Let's read it. Psalm 40 and verse 5 says,

00:08:18.689 --> 00:08:24.930
How many things you have done, O Jehovah my God? Your wonderful works and your thoughts toward us.

00:08:25.889 --> 00:08:30.449
None can compare to you. If I were to try to tell and speak of them,

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:40.620
they would be too numerous to recount. Our gratitude to Jehovah will move us to tell others about

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:49.259
Jehovah's wonderful works, to speak of the many things he has done. And we will never run out of

00:08:49.259 --> 00:08:57.019
good things to say about our God. Those who respond favorably will come to know Jehovah as their

00:08:57.019 --> 00:09:06.379
great healer and enjoy his friendship forever. Granted, today many of us are dealing with serious

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:12.059
health challenges, but we do what we can to share with others this good news about healing.

00:09:12.779 --> 00:09:17.740
And we take delight in Jehovah's promises which cannot fail.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:25.419
When Jesus was on earth, no sickness was beyond his ability to heal, whether it was physical,

00:09:26.059 --> 00:09:34.059
mental or emotional. In the new world, such healings will take place on a much grander scale,

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:43.100
and the cures will be permanent. Many of the great crowd will go through the great tribulation

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:50.620
with serious debilitating illnesses. Our publications have said that it seems reasonable to expect

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:56.860
that shortly after the destruction of Satan's system of things, miracles like those that Jesus

00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:05.100
performed while on earth will no doubt take place on a global scale. That will allow all survivors

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:12.460
of the great tribulation to have a satisfying share in transforming this earth into a beautiful

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:19.820
paradise. And by the end of Jesus' thousand year reign, they will reach the very fullness of

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:27.179
perfect human life. As we enjoy the rich blessings of our spiritual paradise now,

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:33.899
let's keep in mind that these spiritual blessings are evidence that all the promises of the great

00:10:33.899 --> 00:10:41.100
healer will come true. We will forever take delight in the complete fulfillment of Jehovah's promise

00:10:41.659 --> 00:10:51.259
that no resident will say, I am sick. Brother Garrett Lush, a member of the governing body will now

00:10:51.259 --> 00:10:59.659
present the final talk of this symposium. Take delight in God's promises of peace. He will swallow

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.580
up death forever.
