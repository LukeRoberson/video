00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:41.329
On October 26, 1553, Michael Sylvettus was convicted of heresy and sentenced to death by burning.

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:47.490
The following day, he was chained to a post in the city of Geneva, around his feet

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.689
where placed piles of wood ready to be lit.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.450
What was his crime? Sylvettus loved Bible truth and was unable to reconcile the teachings of

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:06.849
the church with his own studies of the Bible. Michael Sylvettus died slowly, yet never once

00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:17.019
that he recanned his faith in the Bible as the word of God. This was by no means the first time

00:01:17.019 --> 00:01:22.620
fire had been used to dissuade or destroy individuals who loved the Bible and its teachings.

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:30.459
Throughout history, the Bible has faced repeated attacks. Empires have tried to destroy it.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:37.019
Religious leaders have tried to hide it. But despite opposition and the threat of death,

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:44.700
many have risked their lives and reputations to protect it. The Bible was completed around

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:52.459
the year 98 CE. At this point, most if not all Christians lived in territory controlled by the

00:01:52.459 --> 00:02:02.540
Roman Empire. Roman Emperor Diocletian began ruling in 284 CE. Dr Peter Williams works at

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:09.500
Tindale House, a centre for biblical studies. Rome didn't have much time for people who didn't

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:17.979
like the Roman religion. Diocletian instigated a systematic persecution of the Christians.

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:24.699
Probably the most systematic persecution that any Roman Emperor ever undertook. He also was very

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:30.699
much against the Christian books. So he wanted to get rid of people's bibles and copies of

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:37.900
books of the Bible. There's a serious attempt to to to to destroy Christianity if possible.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:48.159
Given such extreme opposition, the survival of the Bible and Christianity might have seemed

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:54.960
impossible. How did the Bible writings survive this intense opposition? Here in Dublin, we will

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:02.639
begin to find the answer. I'm meeting Jessica Baldwin, the head of collections at the Chester Beatty Library.

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:12.560
The Chester Beatty Library houses three important papyrus known as P45, P46 and P47. It's believed

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.560
that these papyrus date back to the third century CE, making them some of the oldest known manuscripts

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.319
of the New Testament. This is Chester Beatty's biblical papyrus number two, which is also known

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:31.840
as P46, and it's the earliest surviving copy of the Pauline epistles. The term papyrus is used

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:36.479
quite extensively, but when you look at the manuscripts you can actually see the material that they're

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:43.039
made of. So papyrus is made from the pith of the papyrus plant and it was made in Egypt.

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:48.000
This is interesting because it appears there's that a fold that's down the middle of that.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.639
These were large manuscripts. They were substantial. They weren't single scrolls that were rolled

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:58.400
and unrolled. For a scholar and for the community at the time which these texts would have been so

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.039
vital too to have it in a codex form which could almost you could turn to the section that you

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:08.800
want to refer to. You could really use it as a text to be read, thought about, understood.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:16.000
Professor McGing showed me these manuscripts in further detail. These are real gold standard

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.480
texts. They clearly are the four gospels together and acts. The letters are all separated out

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:31.759
beautifully, smooth, elegant, lines, neatly, arrayed. That in itself is that I suppose

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:38.480
attribute to the faith of the people doing it. This was a task that was important. It was

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:45.680
important to do properly, accurately and beautifully. These have survived because they were contained

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:54.240
within a ceramic pot and buried. These were clearly carefully tended for. They couldn't really

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:00.240
survive in this form otherwise. Whoever it was that protected these manuscripts

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:08.990
showed that they loved the Bible. As the centuries passed, the Bible faced new challenges.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.399
William Tindel was the first person to seek to translate the Bible from the original languages

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:29.680
into English. Tindel was born in the late 15th century. He was born in the area of Gloucestershire,

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:36.639
but had a chance to go to Oxford and became a priest. In the 15th century, there was a lot of

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:42.079
resistance, the idea that the word of God could just simply be accessible by the general people.

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:48.560
People knew the Latin Bible from church which was interpreted by the priest for them. They never

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.079
had direct access to the Bible themselves. Tindel was not allowed to do this translation in

00:05:54.079 --> 00:06:01.120
England. He went to the Bishop of London asking for his permission to translate the new testament

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:07.120
from the Greek, the original text, into English, but was not given that permission.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.160
Such was the opposition to Bible translation. The Tindel later wrote there was no place to do it

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:23.360
in all England. And so with the help of merchants sympathetic to his cause, Tindel fled to Germany

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:29.920
where he could more easily work on his English translation of the new testament. By 1525,

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:36.000
his translation was complete and ready to be printed. The British Library in London holds the

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.040
answer to what happened next. Dr. Karin Limperhertz, a lead curator at the library, is going to help

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:48.319
us find out. So we're looking at a unique copy of the first edition of Tindel's New Testament,

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:54.319
printed in Colone in 1525. The Colone fragment is the only known copy of what exists of Tindel's

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:58.800
first edition of the New Testament. The fact that it is a fragment shows that it was a dangerous

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:06.319
thing to do. The printer had too much to drink and mentioned that he was printing this pro-Lutheran

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:11.920
English New Testament for somebody called William Tindel. The authoritist found out about it and the

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.720
printer was raided. Tindel and his partners ran and this is all that survived today and they

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.040
went down the Rhine a bit further to Worms. So the fact they didn't get much further than

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:26.319
then partway through Matthew is quite indicative of how dangerous it was. The first complete copies

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:32.160
of Tindel's translation of the Christian Greek scriptures were finally printed in the city of

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:39.360
Worms in Germany in 1526. Around 3,000 or more of these books were produced.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:56.540
After leaving Germany, Tindel moved to Antwerp. This bustling city was ideal for Tindel.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:03.259
It had a thriving printing industry and its busy port made it easy for his books to reach

00:08:03.339 --> 00:08:09.819
readers in England. Professor Guido Latry has kindly offered to show me around the very streets

00:08:09.819 --> 00:08:17.980
Tindel would have walked himself some 500 years ago. What he saw around him here was ordinary people

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:24.779
having access to the Bible in Dutch. He wanted the same for his own folk in England.

00:08:24.779 --> 00:08:31.100
If he wanted to smuggle Bibles on a large scale into England, this was Northern Europe's

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:40.460
biggest seaport. You can't easily smuggle a big volume and a big format. So tiny loose leaves

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:46.860
that were taken to places like this. These underground sellers, the warehouses, and between

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:52.700
the leaves of larger books that were not forbidden, the tiny leaves of Tindel's translation

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:58.299
would have been hidden. In London, someone would have recognized, aha, these are the stacks at our

00:08:58.299 --> 00:09:04.779
market. I must have a look at these and find the loose leaves of Tindel's Bible. There were

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:11.899
about 30,000 copies of Tindel's Bible available by the end of his life. This was a brave man,

00:09:11.899 --> 00:09:18.779
a big man in terms of courage, and in terms of investment of time, and the risk he took are not

00:09:18.779 --> 00:09:26.940
to be underestimated. William Tindel was imprisoned here in Volvod, just north of Brussels.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:32.059
As he languished in prison for over a year, he no doubt contemplated the cruel death

00:09:32.059 --> 00:09:37.500
inevitably awaited him. Tindel is often renowned for his influence on the English language,

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:44.539
but his work was more than that of just scholarly ambition. Tindel loved the Bible.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:50.940
Maybe it can be said of him that he shared the feelings of the Samist, who spoke of God's word and

00:09:51.899 --> 00:10:13.179
said, how I do love your law. As news of Tindel's deaths spread throughout Europe,

00:10:13.899 --> 00:10:18.299
it no doubt concerned other truth seekers who were making their own studies of the Bible.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:26.299
One such man was Michael Servetus, who we mentioned at the outset. He was born here in the

00:10:26.299 --> 00:10:32.700
Aragon region of northern Spain. We have traveled to Villanueva de Siena to find out more about him.

00:10:33.419 --> 00:10:37.659
Sergio Batches is the director of the Michael Servetus Institute,

00:10:37.659 --> 00:10:41.500
which runs a museum in the house where it is believed Servetus was raised.

00:10:43.419 --> 00:10:49.500
We have a young man who is exposed to the main religious problems at that time,

00:10:50.139 --> 00:10:58.139
that influence his future thoughts about some of the tricky issues related to Christianity,

00:10:58.139 --> 00:11:03.580
such as, for instance, the dogma of the Holy Trinity. So he wanted to go to the sources,

00:11:04.139 --> 00:11:11.340
and that's what Servetus thought. The truth must be found in the Bible.

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.899
Dr. Marion Heller has published work on Michael Servetus.

00:11:16.779 --> 00:11:25.019
He was sent, probably, upon the advice of his father, to lose, to study the law.

00:11:25.019 --> 00:11:30.620
In Toulouse, which was a very restrictive place, where reading of the Bible was forbidden,

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:35.899
he got involved in serious studies of the Bible. He had intellectual curiosity.

00:11:36.539 --> 00:11:40.700
At that time, you see, the main issue which people were really discussing in the streets

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:47.100
and everywhere was the religion. In 1531, Servetus published his first book, entitled,

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:52.539
on the eras of the Trinity. In his book, he questioned the teachings of the church,

00:11:52.539 --> 00:11:57.019
regarding the identity of God and Jesus. He later wrote,

00:11:58.139 --> 00:12:05.019
in the Bible, there is no mention of the Trinity. We get to know God not through our proud philosophical

00:12:05.019 --> 00:12:14.940
concepts, but through Christ. In his writings, Servetus quoted from a alluded to at least 52

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:21.259
of the 66 books of the Bible. It's clear that Michael Servetus was a man who valued the

00:12:21.259 --> 00:12:28.620
teachings of the Bible, above all others. Servetus was arrested. It was accused of

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:38.620
heresy. It's a crystal clear example of cruelty and religious bigotry. It was

00:12:39.419 --> 00:12:45.100
expressed that he has to be punished. At that time, the only punishment which you could imagine

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:53.659
was death. I guess his driving force was the search of truth. The need to restore

00:12:53.659 --> 00:13:00.700
his transit to its origins. Although various views on Servetus' conclusions have been raised,

00:13:01.419 --> 00:13:07.019
it's clear he was driven by a sincere thirst for biblical truth. He wrote,

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:13.659
a book has been given us from heaven so that in it we might search after God.

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:20.779
History is full of accounts of those who have risked and given their lives to read,

00:13:20.779 --> 00:13:27.179
to translate, or to understand the Bible. Their overriding motivation must surely have been the

00:13:27.179 --> 00:13:33.500
value they placed on the Bible. The Bible has come to us through great opposition.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:40.620
It has survived physical destruction. The simple act of translating it has been outlawed,

00:13:41.419 --> 00:13:45.820
and those who have strived to read and understand it have often been punished with death.

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:53.820
And yet, the Bible and the wisdom in it survives to this day, a faithful transmission of the

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:59.899
original writer's words. No wonder so many have placed such value on the Bible.
