00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:11.769
I graduated high school that summer and wanted to start regular pioneering.

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:17.140
That's my dad, Grayson.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:25.910
Dad was having car trouble that morning and needed a ride to work, so I gave him one.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.910
Okay, my car was a little messy and smelly.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:40.380
I mean, it was winter and my car's pretty old anyway, so I bother.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.380
When I get a new car, then I'll keep it clean.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:50.619
But he was making a big deal out of nothing.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:06.810
That morning was not good.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.810
I thought it was over, but later that evening, dad brought it up again.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.810
But this time, it went better.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.810
He showed me a picture of his first car.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.810
It looked pretty old, too.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.810
He said that while our home or car may not be fancy or luxurious,

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.810
it should be as clean and presentable as circumstances allow.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.810
I still didn't see what the big deal was.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.810
Then he explained that Jehovah is a clean guy.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.810
And from ancient times, it has always required that his people be a clean people.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.810
Under the mosaic law that Jehovah gave to Israel, cleanness and worship were inseparable.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:57.469
It specified that priests were required to wash their hands and feet before offering sacrifices to Jehovah.

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:05.469
While in an unclean state, an Israelite could not have any part in worship, or it could mean death.

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:15.409
I said, I'm not an Israelite, and we're not under the mosaic law anymore.

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:19.409
He said, true, but it gives us insight into Jehovah's thinking.

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:24.409
The law emphasized that cleanness was required of all those who worship him.

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:30.409
And as Malachi 3.6 tells us, Jehovah has not changed.

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:35.979
Then he said something that really stuck with me.

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:38.979
Besides, it's not all about us.

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:43.219
Didn't he give me a scripture to look up?

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:47.219
It was 2 Corinthians 6, 3 and 4.

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:54.219
And no way are we giving any cause for stumbling so that no fault may be found with our ministry,

00:02:54.219 --> 00:03:00.219
but in every way we recommend ourselves as God's ministers.

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:20.530
I realized that things like our appearance, our homes, and our cars...

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.530
These can all be a solid witness to Jehovah in themselves.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.530
It made sense to me now.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.530
It's not all about us. I knew what I had to do.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:45.789
Not only did I clean my car, but later that year I was able to turn my application for pioneering.

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:51.669
And I'm glad for the lesson I learned from my dad.

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:53.669
It's not all about us.

00:03:53.669 --> 00:04:01.689
Even in little ways, we can reflect favorably on the God we love.
