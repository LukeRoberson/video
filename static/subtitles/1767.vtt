00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:12.500
In the name of my name is Rita, my son is Jackson and my daughter is Sharina, it's just

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.500
a three of us.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:21.300
I have been working in a tea estate as a tea picker, one day I prayed to God very hard.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.500
I said, please, help me to learn about the Bible.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.000
Within two days, drawers, businesses came and knocked on my door and I agreed to study

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
the Bible.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.500
I couldn't believe it.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.000
I only prayed yesterday asking God to help me to study the Bible.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Our meetings began at 4.45, but we have to get ready by 12 o'clock to attend the meetings.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.560
So, we prepare our bags on Wednesday night.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.960
I carried two big bags on my shoulders and walked for three and a half kilometres to get

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.909
to the meetings on time.

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:08.709
We love seeing our brothers, that's why we always go to the meetings early.

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:23.079
I have been pioneering now for a year and six months.

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:29.159
There is no greater happiness than what comes from pioneering.

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.159
This is a one time opportunity.

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:39.439
That is why we decided that we should give the best that we can to Jehovah.

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:45.579
Now, I am so happy to be serving this way.

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.629
I was not paid at all.

00:01:50.629 --> 00:01:56.439
I didn't even have a rupee.

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:05.480
On that day, my children and I ate well, but after eating, we were very worried about what

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.479
we were going to do the following day.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:17.810
So that night, I said a prayer with the kids and we read the Bible.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.810
Jesus said, don't worry about tomorrow.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.810
So I trusted that somehow Jehovah would give us what we needed.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.810
It was ten thirty at night.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.810
I was fast asleep and the phone rang.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.810
Usually, no one calls this late.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.810
So I wondered who could be calling me this late.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:48.530
I picked up the phone and it was a brother on the line.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.530
He said, sister, go to your bookshelf and take the greatest man book.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:01.659
Then he asked me to turn to a page.

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:06.659
When I turned to that page, there was ten thousand rupees between those pages.

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:09.659
We could not believe our eyes.

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.659
It was exactly what we needed for that month's expenses.

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:19.659
A few days earlier, he and his wife had visited us and secretly left the money in the book before leaving.

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:22.659
So I thanked Jehovah in prayer with the kids.

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:37.879
Jehovah already knows exactly what we needed even before we realized it.

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:45.879
Honestly, every night I open the doors, go outside and look up at the night sky.

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.879
When I look up, I see many stars.

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:55.879
I daily meditate about his wisdom, his power, what amazing things he is able to do.

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:04.879
At this universe, how amazingly well he cares for them.

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.879
He takes care of the smallest thing.

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:12.879
I completely rely on Jehovah.

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:24.189
And then I remember that Jehovah has the ability to help us with this Holy Spirit, such a loving father.

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:29.189
He is always holding our hand tight.

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:34.629
And no one can separate us from him.

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:37.629
If anyone tries, they would fail.

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:43.029
He is so generous with his love.

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:46.029
He is so affectionate with us.

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:51.029
No one can take away the love Jehovah has for us.
