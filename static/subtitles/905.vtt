WEBVTT

00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:07.940
So based on current direction from the branch, it seems best that we implement the adjustment that we discuss.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.939
Here's one approach we could take.

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:14.939
I'd never consider handling the situation this way.

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:23.059
And when you look at the direction, to me, it could be interpreted a number of ways.

00:00:23.059 --> 00:00:35.490
We'll probably be right back here on his next visit, having to fix all this.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.490
Can you get your thoughts on something?

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.490
The seals direction.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.490
You've been serving for years.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.490
Does this approach make sense to you?

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:55.750
Does this approach make sense to me?

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.750
If I'm honest, no.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.750
In fact, I struggle with it through the whole meeting.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.750
That's why I just needed a moment to get my mind right.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.750
What do you mean by that?

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.750
Well, I had to remind myself of something.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.750
And this scripture came to mind.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.750
Read verse 22.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.750
Look, to obey is better than a sacrifice, and to pay attention than the fat of rams.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.750
Okay, I get that.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.750
But maybe he hasn't thought it all through.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.750
Well, you know, we all give our thoughts on the matter.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.750
And ultimately, the circuit overseer gave direction based on what he got from the branch office.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.750
I just had to remind myself that it's not about me or what I think.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.750
In fact, I just need to be patient.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.750
Obey the direction.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.750
The rest is up to Jehovah.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.159
You're right.

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.159
Thanks.

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.159
Trust me.

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.159
I need that reminder from Jehovah just as much as you.

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.159
I appreciate you sharing that with me.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.159
Sure.
