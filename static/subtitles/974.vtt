00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.450
What comes to your mind when you hear the expression put away?

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:15.089
You may think of related expressions such as cast aside, dispose of, discard, get rid

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.620
of.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.579
What did we have to put away to become a Christian?

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:27.699
The Bible in the book of Ephesians chapter 4 and verse 22 provides the answer.

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.500
That's Ephesians 4, 22.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:39.259
You were taught to put away the old personality that conforms to your former course of conduct

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:44.219
and that is being corrupted according to its deceptive desires.

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.500
So we had to put away the old personality.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.780
But it's one thing to put it away, it's something else to keep it away.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.700
And that's why in the very next verse, verse 23, Paul encourages us to do this.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.060
And you should continue to be made new in your dominant mental attitude.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.739
That's so important to keep it away.

00:01:08.739 --> 00:01:15.900
Because the old personality has traits that can become peace records.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:23.579
This symposium will consider five peace records that we should put away and keep away.

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:26.379
Each talk will include the following main points.

00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:31.340
Number one, it will define the peace record.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.060
Number two, it will explain how it wrecks peace.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.500
And number three, we will consider how to put it away.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.379
What is the very first one we're going to talk about?

00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:48.859
It is inappropriate boasting.

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:51.299
What is inappropriate boasting?

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.260
Basically, it's self-praise.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.019
And the Bible condemns self-praise.

00:01:57.019 --> 00:02:00.540
Notice Proverbs chapter 27 and verse 2.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:09.659
Let someone else praise you, and not your own mouth, others, and not your own lips.

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:17.860
Self-praise is an evidence of pride, and that causes one to elevate himself above others.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.300
Some might develop an unhealthy pride about their accomplishments,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.939
even in the ministry.

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:27.340
It happened in the first century.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.060
Paul had to write the Corinthian congregation about the dissensions that they were having,

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.219
the lack of peace they were experiencing.

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:35.219
Why?

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:41.620
Well, some of the congregation were popped up in pride about themselves or other men,

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.460
such as Paul, Apollo's, Seaface.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.289
They were giving too much attention to themselves and to other men.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.169
Well, how could that happen today?

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:59.569
Well, let's imagine a group of brothers talking, and one in the group says,

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:06.370
with Jehovah's help, and with diligent prayer and effort, I finally got a Bible study.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.370
But right away, another one in the group proudly declares,

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.689
I have four Bible studies, two are attending meetings, and one will soon be baptized.

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:21.939
Could such a statement be a peace record?

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.060
How does inappropriate boasting wrecked peace?

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:34.180
Well, it's not wrong to take pleasure in our work and to thank Jehovah for the success that we may have.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:42.539
But inappropriate boasting about our accomplishments can stir up competition, envy, and rivalry.

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:48.340
We must remember that self-promotion does not originate with our Heavenly Father, the God of Peace.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.699
Where does it originate?

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:52.780
John 2.16 says,

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.979
The showy display of one's means of life does not originate with the Father,

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:00.900
but originates with the world.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.259
And wouldn't you not agree that the world is filled with self-praise?

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:09.219
Even on their social media, we see this.

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:16.459
Some of the material that people post on the social media is designed to make the one appear very important.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:25.420
And it is a showy display of their accomplishments, material possessions, or their expensive vacations that they enjoy.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.980
In other words, it's all about look at me.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:38.939
Well, we want to avoid getting caught up in the world's spirit of self-promotion that wrecks peace.

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:45.259
To illustrate just how devastating the peace record inappropriate boasting can be,

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:49.300
let's briefly consider the Bible character, Haman.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.060
He was a proud and haughty man, and he boasted a lot.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:00.899
Esther chapter 5 tells us that he was boasting with his family and friends about his wealth, his many sons,

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:03.740
how the king had promoted him to a high station.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:12.259
He was above all the other servants, and that he'd had a special meal or banquet with the king and queen.

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:15.100
But Haman was hateful and arrogant.

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:20.300
And he was plotting to kill Jehovah's Faithful Servant Mardekai.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.300
But his scheme and his attitudes were exposed and what happened.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.579
The very stake that Haman had built to hang Mardekai on, he was hung on.

00:05:31.579 --> 00:05:33.860
And it reminds us, doesn't it?

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.699
At Isaiah, chapter 29 and verse 20, the Bible says,

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:42.139
the bolster will come to his finish.

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:47.620
So because of the devastating effects that improper boasting can have on ourselves and others,

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:53.019
we do not even want to give the impression of boasting.

00:05:53.019 --> 00:06:04.319
In the following dramatization, notice how a sister's action are misunderstood as boasting.

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:09.879
What's away from yourselves every kind of malicious bitterness, anger,

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:17.319
wrath, screaming, and abuse of speech, as well as everything injurious?

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:19.639
Did anyone start the day thinking,

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:24.600
I believe I'll show malicious bitterness to my brother today?

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.959
Of course not, and yet the potential is there, isn't it?

00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:34.160
But genuine affection, faith, peace records,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.959
and affection grows when we really know our brothers and sisters well.

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:49.879
We remember their joys and pain, their selfless zeal,

00:06:49.879 --> 00:07:01.740
how they came to love Jehovah, and what they endure.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.420
I'll get back it since I can.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:04.699
Love you. Bye.

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:06.500
Oh, no.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.500
I love you.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.500
Yeah.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.500
I love you.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.500
Thank you.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.500
Thank you.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.500
Oh, thank you.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.500
Hello.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.500
Oh, thank you.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.500
I love you.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.500
I love you.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.500
Oh, thank you.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.500
Yeah, thank you.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.500
Oh, thank you.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.500
Thank you.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.500
Oh, thank you.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.500
Hello.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.500
Hello.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.500
Hello, Hailey Darling.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.500
I'm so, so sorry.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.500
It's not too bad.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.500
I got this.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.500
How are you?

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.500
Thank you.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.500
I'm so sorry.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:33.500
Poor thing.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.500
Let me clear it.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:08:48.809
Poor thing. Let me clear this up. Hello everyone, Haley from Genoa Design here, helping you to be effortlessly elegant.

00:08:48.809 --> 00:09:22.990
Can you believe how? Haley's business feed. When you look this good.

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:43.250
Was the sister in this video hosting inappropriately? No. She was a humble servant of Jehovah, kindly and patiently helping her elderly relative.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:50.250
But do you recall her business website and the presentation she made about her jewelry products?

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:57.250
She said, when you look this good, you feel great.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:06.250
Her Christian sister was upset and took those comments and her actions to be boastful.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:13.250
Well, this video reminds us to think about how our words and our actions may appear to others.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:20.250
So now we're going to get to the question, how do we put away inappropriate boasting?

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:31.250
A key point that we must always remember to help us to do just that is recorded in the book of 1 Corinthians chapter 4 and verse 7.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:38.250
For who makes you different from another? Indeed, what do you have that you did not receive?

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:45.250
If in fact you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not receive it?

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:55.250
What's the point of this scripture? We do not want to boast about ourselves but give all credit to Jehovah for the good that we can do.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:11:07.250
Now, some people are proud about their good looks, their popularity, their wealth, their position, their physical strength, musical ability.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:12.250
But remember, King David of Ancient Israel had all of those assets.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:20.250
But throughout his entire life, he never became a boastful person. He remained humbled. Why?

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:36.250
In Psalm 113, 5 through 8, David gave all credit to Jehovah. He said, in his case, Jehovah stooped down and took this lowly one and raised him up to sit with nobles.

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:46.250
And on every occasion that he had, David would always say, praise Jehovah, boast about his holy name.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:12:01.250
Well, we like David, should boast in Jehovah. The Apostle Paul encourages to do that at 1 Corinthians 131. The one who boasts, let him boast in Jehovah.

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:12.250
What does that mean? It means that we boast in the privilege of knowing the true God and of being able to be used by him to accomplish his will.

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:26.779
Now, another way that we can put away in proper boasting is to not talk about ourselves, but to acknowledge the good and the fine qualities that our fellow workers have.

00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:39.059
Humble and modest people don't brag about what they do, but they turn their attention to their fellow workers and see how Jehovah is using them and blessing them in his service.

00:12:40.059 --> 00:12:46.529
And when we do that, that creates a very peaceful, happy environment.

00:12:46.529 --> 00:12:54.529
Well, may we continue to put away and keep away inappropriate boasting, self-praise. How?

00:12:54.529 --> 00:12:59.529
By giving praise and thanks and honor to Jehovah for our accomplishments.

00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:06.529
And by commending our fellow workers for all the good qualities they have and how Jehovah is using them in his service.

00:13:06.529 --> 00:13:14.529
By doing so, we will preserve our precious possession of peace with Jehovah and with our brothers.

00:13:14.529 --> 00:13:26.899
Brother Seth Hyatt, a helper to the service committee, will now present the next talk of this symposium, put away peace records and be.
