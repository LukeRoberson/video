00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:05.230
In Deuteronomy chapter 8 verse 7 it says,

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.230
For Jehovah your God is bringing you into a good land.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:16.230
Today what makes that same land beautiful is not its location, but its people.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:23.230
This year we saw an Israel a peak of 1500 and two publishers in 25 congregations,

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:31.230
8 Hebrew, 13 Russian, 2 Arabic, 1 English and 1 Hebrew sign language congregation.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:39.229
In Palestine there are 73 publishers in 2 congregations, Ramallah and Bethlehem.

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:44.770
After two years of major building renovations,

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.770
we enjoyed last October sharing in a Bethel dedication program.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.770
It was a real privilege to have the dedication taught delivered by your member of the governing body.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:04.620
With a political climate in a Middle East saw uncertain, war broke out last July,

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:12.620
with over 4,000 rockets raining down on Israel, and over 40 of them on downtown Tel Aviv near Bethel.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.620
Despite all this, the brothers courageously continued their activity.

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:28.859
Recently started the metropolitan public witnessing program that is giving a fine witness in a center of Tel Aviv.

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:33.859
In a ministry, we still facing opposition from religious elements.

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:38.859
Usually they follow brothers around chanting out the word missionaries.

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:43.859
We have to know that in Israel most people consider this word derogatory,

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:48.859
feeling that we should not preach to Jews as they belong to the chosen nation.

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:57.780
But these does not deter the brothers who continue boldly preaching the kingdom message.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.780
This year we received approval for another special preaching campaign.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:11.780
We are very grateful considering that around 80% of our ration and Arabic and Hebrew territory is still uncovered.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:18.610
The field ministry in Israel is generally pleasant and gives good fruit,

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.610
as we can see by the following experience.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:28.610
20-year-old Orel came in contact with the truth while he was doing his military service.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.610
He was serving as a tank gunner and was very nationalistic.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.610
He had a friend by the name of Luba, and she was studying with the witnesses,

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.610
so he was determined to save her.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.610
They would often meet at coffee shops and discuss the Bible,

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.610
but she knew her Bible much better than he did, which really annoyed him.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.610
A one day he said to her,

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.610
if you will have me believe that Paul said that the law is down a way with,

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.610
I will reject Paul rather than the law.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.689
Later he was sent to Gaza and said,

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:09.689
that is where everyone wanted to go. That's where the action is.

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:15.689
At that time Orel did not have any problem with what he was doing.

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:19.689
Eventually though, with the many Bible discussions,

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:22.689
he started to feel uncomfortable.

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:25.689
He relates, through my tank telescope,

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:29.689
I saw old men, women, and children.

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:33.689
Looking at them, I could feel nothing but love for them,

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:37.689
they being children of God just as I am.

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:45.830
In one instance in particular, his company was just finishing a 24-hour lookout

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.830
when a mass force is open-fired on an Israeli officer.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.830
They took up their battled position.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.830
He relates, I had in our sights, a van packed with seven armed terrorists

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.830
with the safeties off and my finger on the trigger.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.500
We were all ready and set to fire.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.500
The tank crew and radio were waiting in complete silence for the go ahead.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.500
But I didn't want to shoot,

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.500
even though killing those men would have made me decorated.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.769
I was not sure what God's will was on the matter,

00:04:25.769 --> 00:04:28.769
so I decided to pray.

00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:34.769
All I could think about was Jesus' word at Matthew 26 verse 39,

00:04:34.769 --> 00:04:40.620
not as I will but as you will.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.620
Contrary to all expectations, we never got that go ahead.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.620
That was back in 2011,

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.620
and from that time Orel decided to study it with a brother regularly

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.620
and at an meetings.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.620
After a while, his conscience troubled him so much that he decided to leave the army

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.620
and immediately stopped carrying a weapon.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.620
The process took nine months, but eventually he was discharged.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.620
A month after that, he became an unbaptized publisher.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:20.620
Some months later, Orel and Luba is from a friend with whom he was discussing the Bible,

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.620
not married, they dedicated their lives to Jehovah,

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.959
and they were baptized in August 2013.

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:32.959
Israel is no more the promised land,

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:35.959
but the brothers are still enjoying Jehovah's many blessing,

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:39.959
knowing that such blessing does not depend on location,

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:45.959
but is the result of listening to Jehovah's voice and doing what he requires.

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:49.959
We are very happy to bring you the warm love and affection

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:52.959
of the 52 members of the Israel-Gothal family.
