00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:09.419
Many people feel that it takes blind faith to believe in God.

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:20.070
They say that they only believe in what they can see.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:33.000
And often what they see is human suffering.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
God, they cannot see.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
If God is real, they ask,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
why do bad things happen to good people?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:01:02.509
Does believing in God make a person gullible or naive?

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:05.510
At Hebrews 111, the Bible says,

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.510
faith is the evident demonstration of realities that are not seen.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.510
The evident demonstration of God's existence is all around us,

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:29.159
some of it we can see and some of it we can't.

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.159
For example, our son emits ultraviolet rays.

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.159
How are we protected from their harmful effects?

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.159
Our earth has a protective shield.

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.409
The idea of ozone gas that filters out most of the harmful radiation.

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:56.120
If the radiation increases, so does the protective ozone.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.120
It's reasonable to ask,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.120
is there an intelligence behind the earth's processes

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.530
and the things we observe in nature?

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.530
And Hebrews 3 and verse 4, the Bible says,

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.530
every house is constructed by someone.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.770
But the one who constructed all things is God.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.020
Whether is design, there is a designer.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.389
That makes sense.

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:30.389
Wouldn't that same logic apply to our complex earth?

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:36.090
Even if you can accept the possibility of a creator,

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.090
you might wonder,

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:45.020
how do we explain suffering?

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.020
If you see a house in ruins,

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.020
would you conclude that it had no builder?

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.460
Or could there be a more plausible explanation?

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.460
Why deny God's existence because of suffering?

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.460
Instead, let your questions lead to further investigation.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:12.879
