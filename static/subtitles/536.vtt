00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:10.310
Well, we're talking about humility, and from the discussion we can appreciate how humility

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:16.949
is a key is much needed if we're going to view other superior to us.

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.829
But it's easy to talk about humility.

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:26.670
It's another thing, acquiring humility, and that may be a challenge.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:34.030
What the expression, the statement made in 1 Peter, chapter 5, verse 5, in the middle

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:48.450
of the verse, 1 Peter 5, 5, but all of you close yourselves with humility to one another.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:57.890
Now that expression, close yourself, is significant because it shows, it helps to appreciate

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:05.010
that humility is a quality that only we personally can put on.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.170
It's not inherited.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.969
And for sure, it doesn't come naturally.

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:17.930
We have to do it ourselves, and we have to be willing to do it.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.530
Now, in addition to the challenge that we have with humility,

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.969
it is to wear the garment of humility at all times.

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:34.730
And this is so because humility is not encouraging the world right now.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:42.810
We are surrounded by individuals who encourage to be proud because of race, education,

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.689
natural abilities, social status, be somebody, excel.

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.930
And it's the sign of the time of the end.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.090
People are in love with themselves, puffed up with pride.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.969
Well Jehovah is not impressed with the abilities or privileges or challenges that we have.

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:14.800
Anyway, he gave him to us, not what is recorded in 1 Corinthians chapter 4, verse 7,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.639
1 Corinthians 4.7, who makes you different from another?

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:26.960
Indeed, what do you have that you did not receive?

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.439
In fact, you did receive it.

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:36.840
If, in fact, you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not receive it?

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.360
Plainly stated, we have, because somebody gave it to us.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.599
However, this is interesting point.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.520
Jehovah does not give humility.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.159
We have to acquire ourselves.

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:57.840
That's what the scripture said, close yourself.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.520
But Jehovah expects that we do it is not a recommendation.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.759
So how we view ourselves is important to Jehovah.

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:10.680
It matters to him.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:20.319
So therefore, the aspect of humility, to consider our superior to us, is important.

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.159
But it has to be genuine humility.

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:29.479
Now, why do we say genuine humility?

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:35.599
Because there is a false humility in this mentioned in Colossians chapter 2.

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:43.080
And false humility is a desire to elevate oneself above others by an outward appearance

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:49.680
of humility just to impress people, and that's not going to make us consider others superior

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.680
to us.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.000
But the challenge that we have with humility is to wear the garment of genuine humility

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.400
our old times.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.199
And this is real.

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:03.120
Now, why?

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:12.879
Because a time circumstances may change for the better in our situation, or circumstances

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.879
may not meet our preferences.

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:17.920
And that happens.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.480
It impacts how we feel, our feelings.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.079
Note this situation as an example.

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:29.560
It's Hager, Sarah, and Abraham.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:40.170
Let's go to Genesis chapter 16, Genesis chapter 16, verse 4.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:47.250
So Abraham had relations with Hager, and she became pregnant.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:53.290
And she realized that she was pregnant, a change of circumstances for the better for

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.810
her.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:03.569
She began to despise her mistress, interesting, the change of feelings.

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:09.730
So Hager had a hard time seeing Sarah superior to her.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:16.569
Now, from Jehovah's point, what was the solution to the problem?

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:22.069
Please go to verse 9 of the same chapter.

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:30.910
Jehovah's angels then said to her, return to your mistress, and what humble yourself

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:36.750
under her hand, close yourself with humility.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:44.029
Now, another example of the impact of a change of circumstances can have on displaying humility

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:46.629
is Korah.

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:52.670
Korah was a cousin, the first cousin of Moses and Aaron, with a prominent man in this

00:05:52.670 --> 00:06:00.509
room, has seen beautiful examples of Jehovah's power and glory.

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:10.389
But it appears that the unfavorable circumstances and the wilderness affected his view of himself.

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:20.189
And him, along with others, resented the fact that so far we're not at the promised land.

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:29.189
But also, in addition to that, as shown in Psalm 106, verse 16, he seems that Korah started

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:38.189
to envy Moses and Aaron, and resented their prominence, their appointment.

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:42.990
But not see them superior to him.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:48.670
Well, committed, they would have helped Korah, to appreciate that Moses and Aaron's appointment

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.189
really came from Jehovah.

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:55.829
He appointed them to the privilege that they were enjoying.

00:06:55.829 --> 00:07:02.829
But his lack of humility caused him not just to envy Moses.

00:07:02.829 --> 00:07:06.870
He went further than that, and this is serious.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:19.259
Please note what happened according to the record in Numbers 16, Numbers 16, verse 3.

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:25.459
So they, Korah and the group, gathered together against Moses and Aaron and said to them,

00:07:25.459 --> 00:07:27.540
we had enough of you.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:33.379
The whole assembly is holy, all of them, and Jehovah's in their mess.

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:40.300
Why then should you exalt yourself about the congregation of Jehovah?

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:47.509
Can you imagine saying that to an appointment by Jehovah?

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:50.870
Yes, this was a serious matter.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:56.870
Lack of humility moved these individuals to rebel.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:02.550
And is a lesson for us what lack of humility can lead to.

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.910
The tragic end of Korah makes it very, very clear.

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:10.910
And on the other hand, we see a beautiful example of the sons of Korah.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.910
They show a humble spirit.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:19.670
And they will copy and contend with being just helpers, assistance to the priests.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:25.189
And in interesting too, humility helped them not to follow their parents.

00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:33.669
So as obvious as we review this issue of humility, that the garment of humility at all times

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:34.669
is needed.

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:40.389
And this is especially when circumstances change in our lives for the better or our expectations

00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:43.470
are actually fulfilled.

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:48.029
But humility can help us in our day-to-day activities too.

00:08:48.029 --> 00:08:57.029
Psalm 15 4 says, he does not go back on his promise even when he is bad for him.

00:08:57.029 --> 00:09:03.710
So humility will help us to be true to our promise, to our Word regardless of whom we made

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.549
the promise.

00:09:05.549 --> 00:09:12.149
So we can see the value of genuine humility as we worship Jehovah.

00:09:12.149 --> 00:09:17.429
And what will be the reward for clothing ourselves with humility?

00:09:17.429 --> 00:09:28.330
Now let's read it in Proverbs chapter 22 and let's read verse 4.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:38.570
The result of humility in the fear of Jehovah is riches and glory and life.

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:40.610
Beautiful, isn't it?

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:44.090
First of all, clothing ourselves with humility.
