00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:07.419
Jehovah's Witnesses are concerned for the welfare of two women

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:10.419
imprisoned in Baku by the secret police.

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:17.420
Elina Zakarchenko is a disabled woman

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.420
and Valida Jean-Braelova is caring for her age mother.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.420
We now turn to Mr. Luca Tofoli, a human rights specialist

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.420
who has worked directly in promoting the human rights of Jehovah's Witnesses

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.420
in Azerbaijan.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.420
Mr. Tofoli, why are these women imprisoned in Azerbaijan?

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.420
Well, they are imprisoned because they were sharing

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.420
arrangements from the scriptures in their public ministry

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.420
and they had with them a brochure for parents called

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.420
Teach Your Children.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.420
They did absolutely nothing illegal.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.420
They were doing what Jehovah's Witnesses do every day

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.420
all over the world.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.420
Jehovah's Witnesses are a registered religion in Baku.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.420
They are not banned.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.420
Is this a recent problem?

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.420
Well, this is not a recent problem.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.420
Jehovah's Witnesses have 19 applications concerning the situation

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.420
in Azerbaijan before the European Court of Human Rights.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.420
So they have faced religious persecution in Azerbaijan before.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.420
However, this recent turn of events is shocking.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.420
Two innocent women are being treated like dangerous criminals.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.420
And presently, how are these women doing?

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.420
These two women are not doing well.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.420
Physically and psychologically, they are failing.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.420
They are both severely depressed.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.420
We understand that the recross attempted to inquire about their health

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.420
but the secret police told them that there was no need

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.420
and that the women were fine.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.420
But you know, these two women are being mistreated.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.420
Is there any possibilities to counter the mistreatment?

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.419
No, they are not allowed to have visits by friends or family.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:12.419
They have been denied pastoral visits.

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:15.419
They have even been denied access to a Bible.

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:19.419
And what efforts have you made?

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:22.419
We appealed, but that has not worked.

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:26.419
We requested to have them transferred to house arrest

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:30.419
so at least then they can be at home.

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:32.419
But the court refused.

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:37.419
Through their attorneys, we have applied to the United Nations Work Group

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:40.419
on arbitrary detention, requesting relief.

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:46.419
It is inhuman to disallow medical assistance to a disabled person.

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:50.419
It is our fervent hope that the authorities of Azerbaijan

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:56.419
will reconsider the treatment of Irina Zakarchenko and Validaj Abrailova.

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:01.419
Their imprisonment is a fragrant denial of fundamental human rights

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:06.419
and religious freedom which Azerbaijan has promised that it would respect.

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:10.419
We asked the government to release these innocent women

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:13.419
who are being unjustly imprisoned.

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:15.419
Thank you, Mr. Toffoli.

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:22.419
And I hope you will be successful to alleviate the situation of these two women.
