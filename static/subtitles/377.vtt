00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:08.349
If you'd open your Bibles to Romans chapter 12 and verse 1, we'll note that the Apostle Paul,

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:18.910
as has been commented on, talks about reasoning on matters. That's Romans 12 and verse 1. He says,

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.429
therefore, I appeal to you by the compassion of God-brothers to present your bodies as a living

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:35.229
sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, a sacred service with your power of reason. So Paul says,

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:46.350
reasoning has power to it. A synonym for power is influence. And so if you reason something out,

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.630
you'll be influenced to make the proper decision, basically. Now, he also introduced something

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:00.990
else in our text today. Let's go there at 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 and we'll read verses 1 and 2.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.909
However, brother is concerning the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ and are being gathered

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:18.670
together to him. We ask you not to be quickly shaken from your reason, nor to be alarmed,

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:27.230
either by an inspired statement or by a spoken message or by a letter appearing to be from us

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:35.709
to the effect that the day of Jehovah is here. So he introduces this aspect of

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:44.349
being quickly shaken once you come to a conclusion on a matter after reasoning it out.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.870
He says, don't be quickly shaken once you come to a conclusion of the matter as a result of

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:58.030
reasoning the matter out. And that's when he was telling the Thessalonico congregation here.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.430
In the first letter, he had talked about and warned them that Jehovah's Day was imminent,

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.830
that it was coming. And as a result, some of the congregation went beyond that saying that it was

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.789
here. In fact, as the verse 2 says, there apparently was even a letter that appeared to be from Paul

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.710
and saying that it is not that it is coming, Jehovah's Day is here.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:33.949
And so some got sidetracked as a result of not thinking it through and their faith was shaken

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:41.389
apparently. And then as you continue, Paul, then help them to reason further that no, there are other

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:48.909
things have to happen before, before Jehovah's Day. So what I'd like to talk about this matter

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:59.150
of quickly being shaken, that is our faith. It's important because we spend years developing a

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.870
relationship with Jehovah God and developing a solid faith. And just this idea that Paul introduces

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:14.780
that one's faith can be quickly shaken is rather a disconcerting thought. It can happen to

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.500
any of us really. I just think about Judas Iscariot. John 6 verse 64 says from the beginning,

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.860
Jesus knew who was the one that would betray him from the beginning, for the beginning of what?

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.740
The insight book says from the beginning of when Judas started to go bad,

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:38.300
started to give into imperfections and sinful inclinations. Well, how long did that process take?

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:45.099
Well, it was lasted a year from the time he was appointed as an apostle. We know his appointment

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:55.259
was no mistake. So within that sharp period of time, this man went from an apostle to an apostate.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:05.259
That's why it's such good counsel that Paul gave for us not to be quickly shaken from matters

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:12.060
that we have established as a result of good reasoning. Now, there are times that we're more

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:20.139
susceptible to our faith being quickly shaken than others. And I'd like to talk about that

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:27.420
just a moment. What could some of those times be? Well, it could be when we're going through

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:38.540
stress, depression, or anxiety. The March 1st, 2010 Watchtower makes this comment, judgment may

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:48.220
be clouded when one is under great emotional stress. Now, let me give you an example. Hypothetical,

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:55.579
but here's an example. A brother has a deep relationship with his parents. His mother suddenly

00:04:55.579 --> 00:05:07.579
dies. This is a great emotional blow to him. He slips into a mild depression. And as a result,

00:05:07.579 --> 00:05:16.300
his personal study and his spiritual activities slow down. Then a short time later,

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:27.180
a sibling is disfellowship. This crushes him. He can't sleep. He wakes up. He gets to the computer.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:37.389
He turns it on. And he slips into watching something inappropriate. Now, what's just happened

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:46.430
while his good reasoning ability was shaken. It's of note to the November 15, 1992 Watchtower

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:54.910
puts it this way, severe and prolonged mental depression may have worn away some of the person's

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:01.709
normally strong emotional fiber or may have made it extremely difficult to make wise decisions.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:09.470
So what could the brother have done? Well, when he first recognized this mild depression

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:15.149
are slipping from the spiritual activities, it would have been good for him to get someone to

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:24.990
help him identify the cause. Now, what is another circumstance that could might quickly shaken

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:34.639
our faith if we're not on guard? Well, it has to do with the apostates. Now, there is something that

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:42.720
the apostates are talking about and trying to put forward. The media has picked it up. Others

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:50.160
have also picked it up. And that is our scriptural position of having two witnesses a requirement for

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:56.399
judicial action if there's no confession. Now, if you open your Bibles to Deuteronomy 1915, our good

00:06:56.399 --> 00:07:05.920
reasoning is pretty solid on this. And Deuteronomy 1915, the scripture is very, very clear.

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:14.240
It says no single witness may convict another for any error or any sin that he may commit.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:19.360
On the testimony of two witnesses or on the testimony of three witnesses, the matter should be

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:26.240
established. It's very clear, isn't it? You cannot establish a judicial committee based on

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:32.800
one witness. But now listen, here's what they say. Well, now look, the Old Testament also says

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:42.000
that adulteresses should be stoned. Now, since you're not doing that, why do you stick to this

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:50.639
two witness rule? See, if you're not careful, that can do some tricks on your mind because

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:56.639
you have to think it through. Well, how might we do that? Well, we'll go to Matthew chapter 18 and

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:05.040
verse 16 because obviously Christ Jesus established the Christian arrangement. And notice what he said,

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:12.720
Matthew 18 and verse 16, he says, but if he does not listen, take along with you one or two more so

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:21.199
that on the testimony of two or three witnesses every matter may be established. So Christ Jesus

00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:27.439
establishes the fact that there has to be two witnesses. Now, it doesn't mean that if there's

00:08:27.439 --> 00:08:32.720
only one witness that there is no consequences, there might be, depending upon the situation. But

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:41.200
the scriptures are very clear before judicial committee can be convened. There has to be a confession

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:48.960
or two witnesses. So we will never change our scriptural position on that subject.

00:08:49.759 --> 00:08:56.399
Jehovah has given us the ability to reason things out, to think it through. So let's do our part

00:08:56.399 --> 00:09:03.759
and not allow our faith to be quickly shaken. Then we can have the confidence that Paul spoke of in

00:09:03.759 --> 00:09:10.159
second Thessalonians 2 verse 5 when he said, may the Lord continue to guide your hearts successfully

00:09:10.159 --> 00:09:17.360
to the love of God and to the endurance for the Christ.
