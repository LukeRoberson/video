00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:07.219
When I gave up on religion, there was such an emptiness.

00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:11.220
Because I really wanted to believe in God my whole life.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.220
I wanted to believe, where were you?

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.219
You knew I was looking for you, God.

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:20.219
And I felt abandoned.

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:24.219
My love for photography was way back to about age six,

00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:28.219
when I got my first little Kodak Instamatic.

00:00:28.219 --> 00:00:32.219
I just thought it was a wonderful way to document the world.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.750
Dad was very much, I give back to the community kind of guy.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.750
My mom, her biggest quality is empathy.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.750
So growing up with that, I saw the best way to be helpful to people

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.750
was also to become a priest.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.750
Because I thought those were the best people in the best position

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.750
to be the most help.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.310
When I was 18, I went to the college seminary.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.310
And that was the road to the priesthood.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:23.450
I left their angry because we were all going through the motions of ritual.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.459
There was no authenticity.

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:31.459
After a few years, I entered a monastery in the United States

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:36.459
as a counselor in training, working with alcoholic priests.

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:42.459
But again, it reinforced my disappointment with the church

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:45.459
because here was the big secret.

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:53.180
Here's where all the troubled priests go.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.180
I felt everything I had believed in had been a lie.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.180
I tried Zen Buddhism.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.180
I tried Tibetan Buddhism.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.180
I went through all of the churches.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.180
And there was nothing there, nothing.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:15.729
And I said, we're done.

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:18.729
By this point, I had a real edge.

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:21.729
Very, very angry person.

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:24.729
I felt the world had done me over.

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:30.099
I noticed that was reflected in my photography.

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.099
There were less and less people in the pictures

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:37.120
and more and more buildings and objects.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.120
As a psychologist, a professor, a counseling professor,

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.120
my mission was accomplished.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.120
My student could leave that class and had learned how to think for themselves

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.120
and not just to take in what they're being sold.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.560
I did think about organizations lying to people.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.349
You know, I'd been a student of all sorts of learnings,

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.349
but there was always something missing.

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:13.500
When Tom asked me to study with him, I did feel intimidated

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.500
because here you had a man who was a professional in the secular world.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.500
He was a teacher at college, a psychologist.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.500
So to me, that was a challenge.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.500
I had a big ol' notebook of questions.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.500
And he sat beside me.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.500
And he said, so you have some questions, and I said, yeah.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.500
Here we go.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.500
How did your organization handle child sexual abuse?

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.500
How does the money work?

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.500
What's the check in balance?

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.500
Where's the transparency?

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.500
And what I noticed, what he always did, he answered them from Scripture.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.500
This was revolutionary in my mind because these were not just some institutions' views

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.500
or some individuals' views, but this was the very authority of God.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:06.379
You know, studying the Bible changed my life for the better, completely.

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:13.330
I love the diversity of the congregation.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.329
I'm learning so much about how we're all the same.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:31.029
I have a lot more pictures of people.

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:35.029
When people lose hope, they've lost everything.

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:40.029
And by studying the Bible, you learn

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:45.029
why there is suffering, why people die.

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:50.029
You learn that this whole world is not spiraling out of control.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:58.660
By coming to have a real personal relationship with the supreme sovereign of the universe,

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.660
it gives you hope.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.660
I love what I'm still learning.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:03.660
I learn every day.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.660
And that's the difference.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.660
I have confidence in what I'm learning.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.660
Confidence that it's the truth.
