00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.759
You and I make a lot of decisions every day.

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:07.360
Now, some have a little impact on our lives,

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.160
others have a very big impact.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.960
And we can appreciate that we can make choices

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.460
and decisions for ourselves.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.960
Think of how life would be if you made no decisions

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.059
for yourself.

00:00:19.059 --> 00:00:22.160
Someone tells you when to go to bed.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.559
They pick out your clothes,

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:25.559
and they tell you what to do for work.

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:28.059
Well, none of us would like that.

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:31.359
Jehovah gave each of us free will,

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:36.159
and that's the precious gift of making choices for ourselves.

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:39.460
Now, if you ever thought about why Jehovah gave us this gift,

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.159
I mean, why trust us with free will

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:46.359
when he knew that we could make bad choices or decisions?

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:49.460
A one-powerful reason is love.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.359
The only way to give us the gift of love

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:55.359
is also to give us the gift of free will.

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:57.359
The two are tied together.

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:01.460
You really can't have one without the other.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.060
For example, if I program my computer,

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.560
they give me a message every day at 2PM,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.560
John, I love you.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.659
I think you're a wonderful guy.

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.760
I think there'd be a little something wrong

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.260
with me if I thought, oh, isn't that nice.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.060
My computer, it loves me.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.959
Yeah, love only exists if it comes truly

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:23.959
from a free will expression.

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:28.560
Now, did Jehovah place any boundaries on free will?

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.260
Yes, they were stated in the law to the nation of Israel.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.260
And Jesus later repeated them at Matthew chapter 22

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.530
verses 37 through 40.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.730
He said to him,

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.329
you must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.129
and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:53.530
This is the greatest and first commandment.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.430
The second, like it is this,

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.930
you must love your neighbor as yourself.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.030
On these two commandments,

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.230
the whole law hangs and the prophets.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.229
So our use of free will has love of God

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.530
and love of neighbor as its boundaries.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.930
I mean, notice, for example,

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.930
what people are doing in this picture,

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.430
both inside the circle,

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.229
boundary and outside.

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:24.330
See, free will allows us to do any of the things

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.229
we see in the picture.

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:28.830
But love of God and love of neighbor

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.930
move us to reject what's outside the circle

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.530
and choose to do the kinds of things

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.729
that we see inside the circle.

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:39.229
Now, to stay within those boundaries,

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:41.530
Jehovah gave us a marvelous brain

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.830
and a built-in conscience,

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.030
but he also knows we need more help.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.530
And that's why he also gave us Bible principles,

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.229
basic truths from the Bible

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:55.229
that can help us to make good decisions.

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:56.530
And it can safely be said

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.330
that any decision we face can be guided

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.330
by Bible principles.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.330
Now, our creator, Jehovah,

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.629
knows what's best for us.

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.930
And he also trusts us to make decisions

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.530
based on Bible principles.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.729
Because he knows that when we do that,

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:17.229
then we're really truly going to be happy, content

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:20.930
and at peace with him and with others.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.229
So in review so far,

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:25.229
Jehovah gave us free will.

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:28.930
That's the privilege to make choices for ourselves.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.030
And he also gave us Bible principles

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.330
as the boundaries to our choices.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.030
But making difficult decisions

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.530
requires that we train ourselves

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.030
to recognize Bible principles and apply them.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.629
Now let's read Romans chapter 12 and verse 1.

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:52.330
And let's see how this verse describes

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.530
the decision making a process.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.430
Therefore, I appeal to you

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.930
by the compassion of God-brothers

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.330
to present your bodies as a living sacrifice,

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.930
holy and acceptable to God,

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.430
a sacred service with your power of reason.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.430
So are we using our power of reason

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.029
to understand Bible principles?

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:24.430
For example, young children ask lots of questions.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.230
But as a child ever asked you,

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.730
what happens when I drop a ball?

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:29.930
A pencil?

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.230
A book?

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:32.930
No, they don't ask that.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.529
They know what happens to anything they drop.

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:37.629
It falls down.

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:40.629
See, the child doesn't need rules for every object

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:43.629
but has quickly grasped the principle.

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:47.129
Anything he drops falls down.

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:50.230
Now, what if an 18-year-old asks you,

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.230
what's going to happen when I drop this pen?

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.029
Well, it's obvious he's not been paying attention

00:04:57.029 --> 00:05:00.230
to basic principles of life.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.930
So by us paying attention to Bible principles,

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.930
we can very quickly see the pattern

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.529
of love of God and love of neighbor.

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:12.430
And know the right thing to do

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:18.040
without a long list of rules for every situation.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.839
Well, how can we train our power of reason?

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:24.939
We train it by paying attention

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:28.040
as we read and study the Bible.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.439
Now, we don't need rules for which movies to watch,

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:33.339
which songs to listen to,

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:35.839
or what clothes we can wear.

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:39.839
If we're paying attention when we're reading the Bible,

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:43.339
we train our conscience with Bible principles

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:45.339
so we can make such decisions

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:48.939
without needing a long list of rules.

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:51.139
You know, we could compare our training,

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:52.839
our power of reason,

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:56.939
to a blind person using a guide dog.

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:59.639
Now, an untrained dog would be very helpful

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:01.639
to a blind person.

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:05.040
It would bark when others were around, for example.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.740
However, a dog trained in specific skills

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.839
is amazingly helpful.

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:13.240
The dog knows when to stop at curbs,

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.740
walk around obstacles that the person right

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.839
run their head into.

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:21.439
A guide dog is also taught a skill called

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:23.839
intelligent disobedience.

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:27.540
And even if the blind person encourages the dog forward,

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:28.839
it won't obey,

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:32.339
but it'll pull the person back from danger.

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:33.939
Now, it can take a year or more

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:37.040
of training for the dog to learn the amazing skills

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.240
that are so helpful to a blind person.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.240
Likewise, our raw untrained power of reason

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.240
can help us to a degree.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.339
However, it can be amazing

00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:52.639
if we take the time to train it.

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:54.439
Now, here are three skills

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:57.740
that we can use to train our power of reason.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.939
They are illustrating,

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:04.589
analyzing, and balancing.

00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:07.990
Now, to consider our first skill illustrating,

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:13.089
let's use the general topic of forgiveness.

00:07:13.089 --> 00:07:19.600
What Bible principles could help with forgiveness?

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.800
Please think of as many principles and scriptures as you can.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.100
Now, if it helps, you can pause the program now

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:31.529
and write down the principles that come to mind.

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:35.430
Now, your list may include principles like these.

00:07:35.529 --> 00:07:38.029
Matthew 18, 22 says,

00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:41.629
to forgive up to 77 times.

00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:43.930
Proverbs 12, 18 says,

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.029
the tongue of the wise is a healing.

00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:50.529
And Colossians 3, verse 13 tells us

00:07:50.529 --> 00:07:54.230
to forgive one another freely.

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:57.029
Now, the skill we want to learn is illustrating,

00:07:57.029 --> 00:08:01.129
creating a mental picture of an idea or principle

00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:03.430
to see its real meaning and impact.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.230
Now, even if we are not skilled artists,

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:09.829
all of us can and do create pictures in our minds.

00:08:10.829 --> 00:08:15.029
When illustrating, pay attention to things that are similar

00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:18.230
or like the thing you're trying to visualize.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:22.230
For example, if sin is like dead,

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:26.230
then forgiveness is like someone cancelling the dead.

00:08:27.329 --> 00:08:31.129
If a hurtful remark is like a cut,

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:33.929
then forgiveness is like seeing it heal.

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:38.429
If sin is like a mark on a blackboard,

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:40.629
forgiveness is like erasing it.

00:08:42.129 --> 00:08:46.629
A Proverbs 12 and verse 18 is a great example

00:08:46.629 --> 00:08:50.850
of using the like technique.

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:54.750
Thoughtless speech is like the stabs of a sword,

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:59.049
but the tongue of the wise is a healing.

00:08:59.049 --> 00:09:00.850
Imagine what your skin would look like

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.549
if you still had every open cut,

00:09:03.549 --> 00:09:06.850
bruise or bleeding scratch since childhood.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:09.450
See, Jehovah wonderfully designed our body

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:12.450
to heal such minor cuts and bruises.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:16.250
And we can now visualize how the forgiveness of others

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:18.450
helps us to heal emotionally.

00:09:19.549 --> 00:09:21.350
Now, learning to illustrate or visualize

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:23.250
takes time and practice.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.950
However, it can be one of the most powerful skills

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:29.049
we use to train our power of reason.

00:09:29.049 --> 00:09:31.250
And it can also be quite enjoyable.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.149
You know, try at your family worship

00:09:33.149 --> 00:09:35.750
to take the principles for a topic

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:40.450
and see how many similarities or likes you can come up with.

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:43.149
Now, granted, they all won't be amazing,

00:09:43.149 --> 00:09:46.149
but you may be surprised by the insights

00:09:46.149 --> 00:09:49.450
that come from seeing something from a new perspective.

00:09:50.649 --> 00:09:54.149
Well, let's consider now our second skill, analyzing.

00:09:55.049 --> 00:09:58.549
Now, analyzing something means examining it carefully,

00:09:58.549 --> 00:10:03.549
in detail, and let's use the topic of wrong desires.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.149
Now, in this case, let's say we've already found

00:10:07.149 --> 00:10:13.559
the principle at Colossians chapter three and verse five,

00:10:13.559 --> 00:10:15.759
deaden, therefore, your body members

00:10:15.759 --> 00:10:19.360
that are on the earth as respect sexual immorality,

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:23.159
uncleanness, uncontrolled sexual passion,

00:10:23.159 --> 00:10:27.159
hurtful desire and greediness, which is idolatry.

00:10:28.159 --> 00:10:31.860
Now, what can we learn from analyzing Colossians chapter three

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:35.360
and verse five to help when we struggle with wrong desires?

00:10:36.559 --> 00:10:38.759
Again, feel free to pause the program

00:10:38.759 --> 00:10:42.620
if you want some time to think about it.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:46.419
Look carefully at each step outlined.

00:10:46.419 --> 00:10:47.919
Did you notice, for example,

00:10:47.919 --> 00:10:51.019
what appears to be a reverse order

00:10:51.019 --> 00:10:53.419
of the steps leading to sin?

00:10:54.419 --> 00:10:57.620
This verse works its way from sexual immorality

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.720
back to the very roots of the problem.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.919
Now, let's take each phrase starting with the last,

00:11:04.919 --> 00:11:07.919
greediness, which is idolatry.

00:11:08.919 --> 00:11:11.519
So sexual immorality starts with selfishness,

00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:14.519
greedily putting our needs ahead of anything else.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.620
Next is hurtful desire.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.120
Greediness leads to hurtful desire.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:25.220
It's like a person hanging around a bakery,

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:28.820
smelling the bread and cakes when he can't pay for it.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.220
Likewise, hanging around immoral entertainment

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:37.320
or bad associates can feed hurtful desire

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.820
for what is not ours.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.320
Next is listed uncontrolled sexual passion.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:48.519
So hurtful desire has now turned from an idea

00:11:48.519 --> 00:11:51.620
into a strong emotion of passion,

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:55.419
causing one to look for an opportunity to fulfill the desire.

00:11:56.919 --> 00:11:59.519
Next, uncleanness.

00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:02.519
The previous steps have now led to inappropriate,

00:12:02.519 --> 00:12:07.019
physical contact with another person.

00:12:07.019 --> 00:12:10.820
Finally, sexual immorality, serious sin.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.419
Sexual immoralities occurred between persons

00:12:13.419 --> 00:12:15.720
that are not married to one another.

00:12:16.919 --> 00:12:20.519
So analyzing Colossians chapter three and verse five

00:12:20.519 --> 00:12:23.320
can really help us to eliminate,

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.120
not stimulate wrong desires.

00:12:25.919 --> 00:12:27.919
And we can see how important it is

00:12:27.919 --> 00:12:30.919
to get rid of wrong desires immediately.

00:12:30.919 --> 00:12:32.419
It's easier to walk away from sin

00:12:32.419 --> 00:12:35.220
when we're still in the early stages rather than later.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.620
So we need to practice a skill of not simply just

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:43.320
reading scriptures, but analyzing them

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.820
until we've learned all that we can.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.519
And we can use the many research tools

00:12:47.519 --> 00:12:50.519
we have to find valuable comments and application.

00:12:51.919 --> 00:12:56.320
Now let's consider our third and final skill balancing.

00:12:57.519 --> 00:12:59.919
And to do that, let's use a question

00:12:59.919 --> 00:13:01.320
on the topic of alcohol.

00:13:02.919 --> 00:13:06.820
What Bible principles could help a couple to decide

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.320
whether to serve alcohol at their wedding?

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.519
What principles and scriptures do you think

00:13:13.519 --> 00:13:16.320
would help them make a balanced decision?

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.519
Again, you're welcome to pause the program.

00:13:19.519 --> 00:13:20.919
And if you'd like to write down

00:13:20.919 --> 00:13:25.259
what comes to mind or to research something.

00:13:25.259 --> 00:13:29.059
Now your list probably has some of these principles.

00:13:29.059 --> 00:13:31.059
At John chapter two and verse nine,

00:13:31.059 --> 00:13:32.759
Jesus made wine for a wedding.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.259
However, first Corinthians chapter six and verse 10 says

00:13:37.259 --> 00:13:39.759
that drunkards will not inherit the kingdom.

00:13:40.899 --> 00:13:44.460
And first Corinthians 10, 31 and 32 says,

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:47.100
whether you're eating or drinking,

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.700
do all things for God's glory.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.159
And to keep from becoming causes for stumbling.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:58.059
Now it doesn't seem that any one principle

00:13:58.059 --> 00:13:59.360
provides the answer.

00:14:00.299 --> 00:14:01.460
The couple could simply say,

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.500
well, Jesus served wine at a wedding, so can we do?

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.399
However, there's really more to it than that, isn't there?

00:14:08.399 --> 00:14:10.799
It's clear that a balance

00:14:10.799 --> 00:14:13.059
of all these Bible principles is needed.

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.220
Will relatives or others be there

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.379
who might be prone to over drinking?

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:21.860
Would serving alcohol bother the conscience

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.500
of many present because of local customs

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.259
and feelings about alcohol?

00:14:27.539 --> 00:14:29.840
It's often the case when making decisions

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:33.679
that we need to balance several Bible principles

00:14:33.679 --> 00:14:37.299
not taking any one principle solely on its own merit.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:42.139
Jehovah expects us to use our power of reason

00:14:42.139 --> 00:14:45.940
to balance Bible principles and make good decisions.

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:51.019
Ecclesiastes chapter seven and verses 16 through 18

00:14:51.019 --> 00:14:54.059
gives us good advice about being balanced.

00:14:55.379 --> 00:14:57.700
Do not be overly righteous,

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:00.659
nor show yourself excessively wise.

00:15:00.659 --> 00:15:03.419
Why should you bring ruin to yourself?

00:15:03.419 --> 00:15:06.419
Do not be excessively wicked nor be foolish.

00:15:06.419 --> 00:15:08.820
Why should you die before your time?

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.460
It is best to grasp one warning

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.860
without letting go of the other

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:18.059
where the one who fears God will heed them both.

00:15:18.059 --> 00:15:19.379
How true.

00:15:19.379 --> 00:15:22.860
Such balance between extremes is often necessary

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.100
when we apply Bible principles.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:28.179
We need to heed them both, so to speak.

00:15:28.179 --> 00:15:31.419
We need to balance all the Bible principles

00:15:31.419 --> 00:15:33.419
so we can come to the decision

00:15:33.419 --> 00:15:36.019
that would show love of God and love of neighbor.

00:15:37.379 --> 00:15:39.220
We could illustrate the balance

00:15:39.259 --> 00:15:41.740
between different Bible principles

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.059
and applying them with this modeled bike.

00:15:44.059 --> 00:15:46.820
It was a gift from a brother in Malawi.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:50.620
Now, a bicycle has three basic principles of operation.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:54.419
The brakes, the pedals, and the steering.

00:15:54.419 --> 00:15:57.460
Now, the brakes are really like principles

00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:01.700
that slow us down or stop us from doing the wrong thing.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.940
And the pedals are really like the principles

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:06.940
that move us forward in showing love for Jehovah

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.779
and our brothers and sisters.

00:16:08.779 --> 00:16:11.620
And the steering is like our free will

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:15.940
to choose a direction in life that pleases Jehovah.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:19.419
So making decisions is like riding a bicycle.

00:16:19.419 --> 00:16:23.500
We have to balance several Bible principles.

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:28.940
So in review, Jehovah gave us free will

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:31.460
to use within the boundaries of love of God

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:32.500
and love of neighbor

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.659
and many other fine Bible principles.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:37.539
Making difficult decisions requires

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:39.259
that we train our power of reason

00:16:39.259 --> 00:16:42.580
to recognize Bible principles and apply them.

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.299
And we discussed how to train our power of reason

00:16:45.299 --> 00:16:49.779
with the three skills illustrating, analyzing, and balancing.

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:54.019
So no matter what decisions you're faced with,

00:16:54.019 --> 00:16:58.220
we encourage you, let Bible principles guide you.
