00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.660
Our focus today is on two beautiful Christian qualities

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.160
that are married to each other, the go hand in hand,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.660
faith and hope.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.160
Why is it so important for you and I to strengthen our faith

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.160
in what we hope for?

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.160
Please open your Bible with me to Hebrews chapter 12

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
and I'd like you to focus on verse 1.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.160
Of course, we know in the context in the previous chapter,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.160
Hebrews chapter 11, the Apostle has just defined faith

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.159
and then went on to recount many examples of men and women

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:39.659
who exercised strong faith and kept their focus on their future hope.

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:45.159
And they did so throughout the course of their entire life, even to death.

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:49.159
But now, notice the exhortation that the Apostle builds on

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:52.159
as found in Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 1

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:55.159
and we'll also read the first part of verse 2.

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:00.159
So then, because we have such a great cloud of witnesses surrounding us,

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:07.159
let us also throw off every weight and the sin that easily entangles us

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.159
and let us run with endurance, the race that is set before us,

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.159
as we look intently at the chief agent and perfector of our faith, Jesus.

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.159
Now, in verse 1, Paul mentions the sin that easily entangles us.

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.159
What should we visualize?

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.159
Well, that Greek expression could help us to picture a runner in a race

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.159
who has too many clothes on.

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.159
I'm picturing a man who has instead of shorts on,

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.159
he has oversized sweatpants,

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.159
tennis shoes with his shoes unlaced,

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.159
how easy it would be for him to trip and fall

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.159
to be entangled in his own clothing and attire.

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:01.159
Well, that's the word picture that the Apostle Paul used to describe a danger that faces all of us,

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:10.159
including experienced Christians who have a record of faith that sin is a lack of faith.

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:17.159
For a newer Christian, it could be not developing the faith that we had at the beginning

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:22.159
after baptism, but for an experienced Christian,

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:29.159
that lack of faith could be a loss of once strong faith we had in the past.

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:34.159
To that latter point, you might notice in verse 1 that the Apostle Paul,

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:41.159
a pillar in the congregation, a man of faith, includes himself in the exhortation.

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:48.159
He says, let us throw off every weight, let us run with endurance.

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:54.159
By including himself, Paul was likely admitting his own inclination, his propensity,

00:02:54.159 --> 00:03:00.159
to get easily entangled in episodes of momentary weakness of faith.

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.159
Well, that's a powerful lesson for all of us, isn't it?

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:07.159
All of us need to keep strengthening our faith.

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:14.159
What is more, the Bible makes it clear that if we get entangled in a momentary loss of faith,

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:18.159
we can recover, and we can recover quickly.

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:22.159
Notice this in an experience that the Apostle Peter had.

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:29.159
Open please with me to Matthew 14 and cast your eyes to verse 24.

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:33.530
Now visualize the scene.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.530
It's early in the morning before dawn.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:43.530
Peter and some of the disciples are struggling to row their boat in the sea of Galilee during a storm.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.530
Suddenly they see Jesus walking on the sea.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:54.530
In verse 26, when they catch sight of him, the Bible tells us they cried out in their fear.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:02.530
Peter, those disciples, hearty, fishermen, manly men, cried out in fear.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:09.530
Verse 27, Jesus tells them, take courage, it is I, do not be afraid.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.530
Then what did Peter do?

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.529
Verse 28, Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you over the waters.

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:20.529
Well, when Jesus told Peter to come, what did Peter do?

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:25.529
He got out of the boat and he started walking on the water toward Jesus.

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:28.529
Did that take faith? Indeed.

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:32.529
But soon after we know, as the account goes on to say,

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:34.529
Peter began to sink.

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:37.529
Why? Notice the opening of verse 30.

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:42.529
But looking at the wind storm, he became afraid.

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:47.529
When Peter lost his focus on Jesus, his faith wavered.

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:51.529
This was a momentary period of weak faith.

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:55.529
The same can happen to any of us, including experienced Christians.

00:04:55.529 --> 00:05:00.529
The loss of focus can lead to a loss of faith.

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:05.529
Have you gone through or are going through some storms in your life?

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:09.529
The wind and the waves that were surrounding Peter as he walked on the water

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:15.529
could be compared to the trials and the temptations that we face in our dedicated service to Jehovah.

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:21.529
Thanks to our faith, you and I are doing something that for the majority seems impossible.

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:26.529
Having a clean standing in a dedicated relationship

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:30.529
in the last days of this difficult system of things.

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:33.529
But winds and waves are coming our way.

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:38.529
Perhaps it's unexpected illness for us or a close family member or friend.

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:42.529
Maybe it's the fear that comes from the economic pressures

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:45.529
that are upon many of our brothers and sisters,

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:49.529
not just in Venezuela, not just in Africa,

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:54.529
but in all parts of the earth where there's crisis in economies.

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:59.529
Or maybe it's the waves of persecution that come upon our brothers in all places,

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:03.529
not just Russia, perhaps right within the family.

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:08.529
Or what about adjustments that might affect our privileges of service?

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:13.529
You know, a new work assignment here at Bethel or in the field or in the congregation

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:20.529
or a change of assignment that takes us out of the comfort zone of special full-time service

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:26.529
could prove to be a storm for us that causes us to be afraid.

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:33.529
One brother who had his heart set on being a missionary found that after many years in missionary service,

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:36.529
he and his wife had to go home.

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:41.529
For the first time in my life, he says, I lost all sense of direction.

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:46.529
I had no goals. Nothing seemed important anymore.

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:48.529
What happened?

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:53.529
A temporary, momentary weakness and faith.

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:58.529
But now let's dwell further on Peter's experience as you look back at verse 30.

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:03.529
What was it specifically that caused Peter to sink?

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:07.529
Was it a big gust or a big wave?

00:07:07.529 --> 00:07:15.529
No. It was his looking at the windstorm that caused him to become afraid.

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:18.529
It was his change in focus.

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:24.529
Likewise, if we lose our focus and dwell too much on our storms,

00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:29.529
circumstances and our day-to-day living in this system of things,

00:07:29.529 --> 00:07:33.529
we look at how powerful those storms are,

00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:37.529
we could begin doubting that Jehovah will support us.

00:07:37.529 --> 00:07:41.529
But now, notice what happens next in verse 30.

00:07:41.529 --> 00:07:47.529
The Bible says, and when he started to sink, he cried out, Lord, save me.

00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:55.529
What Peter did next after his momentary loss of faith is really a powerful lesson for all of us.

00:07:55.529 --> 00:07:57.529
Peter quickly recovered.

00:07:57.529 --> 00:08:01.529
Now, we know from what the Bible tells us that Peter was a capable swimmer.

00:08:01.529 --> 00:08:06.529
His natural inclination could have been to swim back to the boat because he was sinking.

00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:10.529
But he didn't do that. He didn't depend on himself.

00:08:10.529 --> 00:08:13.529
He refocused on Jesus.

00:08:13.529 --> 00:08:17.529
And he took Jesus outstretched hand.

00:08:17.529 --> 00:08:20.529
Well, what's the lesson for all of us?

00:08:20.529 --> 00:08:25.529
If we sense that our faith is ever weakening or starting to give way to fear,

00:08:25.529 --> 00:08:27.529
we need to imitate Peter's example.

00:08:27.529 --> 00:08:30.529
We can recover quickly.

00:08:30.529 --> 00:08:34.529
We might look back at Hebrews 12 and verse 2.

00:08:34.529 --> 00:08:37.840
Hebrews 12 and verse 2.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:45.840
And notice how the Apostle Paul encouraging us to not get entangled in a lack of faith

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.840
says we need to look intently at Jesus.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:55.840
Verse 3. Consider closely the one who has endured hostile speech from sinners

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.840
so that you may not get tired and give up.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:06.840
Looking intently, considering closely, reminds us we need to refocus on Jesus.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:12.840
What was it that Jesus that gave Jesus unbreakable faith, strong hope?

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:18.840
Well, that same account tells us that he looked ahead at the joy that was set before him.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.840
We need to focus on our future blessings.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.840
One of our watchtower articles said this.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:29.840
Put yourself in the picture by writing down or making a drawing of what you hope to do

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.840
once God has removed this system of things.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.840
Make a list of people whom you look forward to meeting when they're resurrected

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.840
and what you would like to discuss with them.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:45.840
See these as God's promises, not to just mankind in general, but to you personally.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:50.840
Jesus, we know, was convinced that the Bible is God's Word.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:55.840
He diligently meditated on God's words, His precious promises.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.840
We need to do the same as well.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.840
Jesus taught us to pray for Holy Spirit.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:05.840
We can ask Jehovah for more faith.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.840
Jehovah will readily respond to such prayers.
