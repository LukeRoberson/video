00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.580
Why are questions so effective?

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.579
Because they encourage our audience to think actively

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:20.579
instead of listening passively.

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:24.579
We can ask rhetorical questions to maintain interest.

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:28.579
We can pose a series of questions to reason on a subject

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.579
and lead our listeners to a logical conclusion.

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.579
And we can ask intriguing questions to introduce key ideas

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.579
or use review questions to conclude our presentation.

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.579
Why use rhetorical questions?

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.579
Well, let's watch what happens when we doubt.

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.579
Romans 6.23 says,

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.820
For the wages seen pays is death.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.820
But the gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus, our Lord.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.390
The gift of the ransom came from Jehovah.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.390
Immediately after Adam and Eve sinned,

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.390
Jehovah stated a solution that would offer hope

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.390
to all of their offspring.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.390
He purposed that one of his Spirit creatures

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.390
come to the earth, live as a perfect human

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.390
and ultimately offer his life as a ransom.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.390
Although it's often easier to explain a Bible text,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.390
questions make our teaching more interesting and effective.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.390
Watch as the speaker teaches the same point using rhetorical questions.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.390
Romans 6.23 says,

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.390
For the wages seen pays is death.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.390
But the gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus, our Lord.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.389
If Jesus is the one who suffered and died for us,

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:15.389
why does the verse speak of the ransom as the gift God gives?

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:18.389
Why not the gift Jesus gives?

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:22.389
Consider what we know from the book of Genesis.

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:25.389
Immediately after Adam and Eve sinned,

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:32.389
Jehovah stated a solution that would offer hope to all of their offspring.

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:36.389
He purposed that one of his Spirit creatures

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.389
come to the earth, live as a perfect human

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:44.389
and ultimately offer his life as a ransom.

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:50.389
There is another way too in which the ransom was a gift from God.

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:53.389
Have you ever thought of what God must have felt

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:57.389
when Jesus was put to death?

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:00.389
Rather than simply stating the truth,

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:03.389
the speaker stimulated interest by posing a question

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:07.389
that prompted his audience to think.

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.389
We can also use questions in the ministry

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:13.389
to help people we meet reason on a subject.

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:16.389
Let's look in on a return visit.

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:21.669
With that I heard a loud voice from the throne say,

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:25.669
Look, that tenth of God is with mankind

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:29.669
and He will reside with them and they will be His people.

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.669
And God Himself will be with them.

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:35.669
And He will wipe out every tear from their eyes

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:38.669
and death will be no more,

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:43.669
neither will morning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:47.669
The former things have passed away.

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.669
So according to this prophecy,

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:52.669
what can we look forward to?

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:54.669
Well, when we're angels in heaven,

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:58.669
we won't have any more pain or death.

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:01.669
It's good that the question prompted a response

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:03.669
from the householder.

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:06.669
However, how can the publisher use questions

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:09.669
to lead the householder to the correct understanding

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:11.669
of these verses?

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:13.669
Let's watch.

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:17.670
Yes, God is going to end pain and death.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.670
But where will this take place?

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.670
The verse says that pain and death will be no more.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.670
Where do pain and death exist today?

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.670
Or on earth?

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.670
Rather than simply correcting the wrong thought,

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.670
the publisher used questions to help the householder

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.670
reason on the scriptures and come to the right conclusion.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.670
Good teaching involves more than just relating information.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.670
As we use tactful questions to maintain interest,

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.670
to reason with our listeners and to emphasize important points,

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.670
we imitate the grand instructor Jehovah God

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.670
and the great teacher, Jesus Christ.
