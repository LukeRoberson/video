00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:16.149
True to Bible prophecy, Jehovah's people today are active across the entire inhabited

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:17.149
earth.

00:00:17.149 --> 00:00:23.030
No matter where they live, they regularly gather as congregations to worship.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.829
So providing suitable places for worship is very important to Jehovah.

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:33.390
The organization has continually refined the arrangement for financing and building

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.070
kingdom halls through the years.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.469
In 2014, for example, under the direction of the publishing committee of the governing

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:49.789
body, the local design construction or LDC arrangement was put in place.

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:55.829
The LDC now cares for kingdom halls, assembly halls, and other field-related facilities

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.070
under each branch.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.630
The service department and LDC work closely together to make sure that existing kingdom

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.269
halls, especially in heavily populated areas, are well used.

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:13.030
This is sometimes prevented having to start new construction.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.510
It also makes the best use of your donations.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.829
And it has resulted in blessings to some isolated congregations.

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:29.629
About 24 miles off the northwest coast of Scotland is the Isle of Lewis and Harris.

00:01:29.629 --> 00:01:35.030
The largest town on the island, Stornaway, is home to one of the most remote congregations

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.109
in the United Kingdom.

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:40.269
We want to share with you their story.

00:01:40.269 --> 00:01:46.310
Notice please, how Jehovah's refinements to the arrangements for providing kingdom halls

00:01:46.310 --> 00:02:00.540
have allowed him to express his love for these dear brothers and sisters.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.980
When I was young, I didn't really appreciate what the island was like, but as I've grown

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:11.539
older, it's just amazed by the beauty of creation.

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:13.699
The terrain is absolutely beautiful.

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:20.000
The air is clear, the beach is a world class, and of course there's mountains.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.080
The Isle of Lewis and Harris, it's very rural, you've got the small town, Stornaway,

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.840
and then as you go out, it's all rural, and there's houses flooded everywhere, and there's

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.520
about 20,000 population on the island.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.199
The people on the island of Lewis and Harris, they're very friendly people, they're very

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:39.520
welcoming.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.439
People have time, they're not so rushed as they were back on, it's more laid back here.

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:51.280
We do full days in the ministry and work around some of the outlying villages with their

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.280
harbours.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.560
The people on the island are very religious, they're also really friendly, so when you do go

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.919
on the ministry, you can have a great conversation with ones.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.759
Well, we absolutely need enducing them all.

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:08.919
At the moment it's in upstairs room.

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:13.400
It's small, it's not easily accessed.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.960
The stairs lead right into the horse, and there's no foyer, older ones as they get

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.000
known in years now, are finally difficult to get up there.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.960
It's served its purpose for 50 years, and it's tired.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.719
But then we can see on the broadcast what's going on right around the globe, and it makes

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:37.120
you feel, yeah, we can wait a bit longer while we're sitting in our old home.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.639
I think we were aware and appreciative that there were other congregations where the

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:48.319
difficulties were even greater than ours, who were going to need the help long before

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:49.319
we had it.

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:54.520
We were happy just to continue worshiping Jehovah until such time as he was able to help

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.520
us.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:04.469
No, very well that Jehovah will provide for us what we really, really need.

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:07.710
The branch committee loves our brothers and sisters in Stornoway.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.550
It doesn't matter whether the congregation is small or whether it's a huge congregation.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.830
We have great affection for every single one of our publishers there.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.029
The need for a new kingdom hall on the island of Lucenhouse has been around for a long

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.029
time.

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:26.149
You know, the brothers have spent many, many years looking for a kingdom hall, but of

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:30.269
course there's challenges involved with that, not least of all the fact that there's

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:32.670
just a small group of publishers there.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.990
When you're so isolated it can be a challenge to remain loyalty to Jehovah's organisation

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.110
because you see your immediate need and you feel that need needs to be met straight

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.110
away.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.550
So being patient and working along with Jehovah's organisation, well that's a beautiful

00:04:48.550 --> 00:05:05.060
quality to have and we admire the brothers for that.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.420
We were on Stornoway Kingdom Hall project, we're working here to build a new kingdom

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.420
hall on the island.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:15.100
We've been in need of it for a number of years now so it's really nice to be here and

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.860
be part of the project.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.139
This is one of those projects that you can just see Jehovah's Hand in Matters.

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:24.100
Two contractors came yesterday to deliver some machinery and they were absolutely blown

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.980
away by the fact that it's volunteers.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:31.459
It's a time when the other churches have got division and see problems.

00:05:31.459 --> 00:05:35.699
But at this time Jehovah's obviously seen it's fitting that his people here benefit

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:38.180
from a new kingdom hall.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.819
I think the nicest thing about this assignment is meeting new brothers and sisters from all

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:47.660
over the place and we've only been here six weeks and yet you feel like they're your

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.660
friends.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.420
The brothers and sisters here in Stornoway have been so patiently waiting for the new

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.420
kingdom hall here.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.300
They can contribute to the worldwide work but they haven't had to pay directly for the

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.300
new kingdom hall.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.899
So it's lovely that small congregation can benefit from the love of Jehovah's organisation,

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:08.420
the love that the brothers and sisters show worldwide.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:48.449
Well, I first walked into the kingdom hall and I was kind of breathtaking because I expected

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:51.129
something really good but it was even better than that.

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:57.930
I just can't believe how wonderful it is because there's finally a place that's worthy

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.290
of Jehovah's name.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:03.889
It shows there are not an isolated group of brothers and sisters here.

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:07.250
Jehovah really loves the brothers here in Stornoway.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:12.569
He's shown this by the response of the other brothers and sisters throughout the country

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:15.250
who have come here from far away to help.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.569
I think that's a display of how Jehovah truly loves the brothers and sisters here in

00:07:19.569 --> 00:07:20.569
Stornoway.

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:32.399
Passionately, I can honestly say with all my heart that I have never felt closer to Jehovah

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:33.399
than I do now.

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:38.560
We can't believe how good Jehovah has been to us.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:44.319
Matthew chapter 18, verse 20 says, for where there are two or three gathered together in

00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:52.319
my name, there I am in their midst, clearly no need is too small for Jehovah to notice.
