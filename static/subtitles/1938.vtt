00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.130
Many people believe that it doesn't matter which religion you choose,

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.810
that religions are like different roads that lead to the same destination,

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.309
lasting blessings from God.

00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:21.410
But can that be true?

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.390
Does God accept all forms of worship?

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.289
The Bible itself describes worship as two roads.

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.390
One is spacious with many people on it.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.490
The others cramped with only a few finding it.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.890
Only the cramped road represents acceptable worship,

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.490
leading to life and blessings from God.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:51.729
How can we tell if we are on the correct path?

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:53.929
Imagine that you're lost.

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:57.630
You stop someone to ask for directions.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.229
One person says to an east.

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.260
Another says to go west.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:13.290
Finally, someone with a map shows you that the destination is actually north.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.450
Which one would you believe?

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:24.560
The Bible is like that map leading us to blessings from God.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.900
So why are there so many conflicting beliefs?

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:39.180
For example, many religions teach that the human soul lives eternally in a spiritual realm

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:47.310
while others believe that they are reborn in another body or form.

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:53.909
This is just one example of the many religious beliefs and conflict with one another.

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.409
Could all religions really be teaching the truth?

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:06.159
According to the map, the dead know nothing at all.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.159
In due time, God will restore them to life

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:15.889
and righteous ones will live forever on earth.

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:19.189
If the Bible is clear on this teaching,

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:23.889
what about other matters such as our personal conduct?

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:26.189
We may belong to a religion,

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:32.780
but if our conduct offends God, our worship may be futile.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.379
The Bible teaches that many people today would be without self-control,

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:45.150
fierce, without love of goodness.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.930
However, it also says that true worshipers of God would be peaceable,

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:59.150
controlling their speech and actions.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.349
Rather than saying there are many religions that please God,

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.050
the Bible says there is only one faith.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:16.449
True worship leads a person to a good relationship with God and everlasting life.

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:21.849
You may wonder, how can you find the true religion?

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:28.110
Must you belong to an organized religion to please God?

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.409
