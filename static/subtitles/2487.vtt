00:00:23.379 --> 00:00:35.409
Go to our school.

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:37.090
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.890
We have a new classmate.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.770
Her name is Priya from India.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:42.929
She's from where?

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:43.929
I don't know.

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:45.329
I'm never out of it.

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.929
OK, so let's work in Paris again.

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:56.049
Who needs a partner and can team up with Priya?

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:57.770
Hey, Sophia.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.740
We're a team, right?

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.180
Yeah, OK.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.180
OK, great.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:13.489
So for the first page, I'm thinking we can do this and then that.

00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:27.349
She's taken.

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:32.030
So what did Jesus teach us to do to be a real neighbor

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.829
like the Samaritan?

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.659
Sophia.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:52.290
He taught us to show love and kindness when somebody needs help.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.719
I'm Sophia.

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:56.760
I like your outfit.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.760
Where did you get it?

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.400
My mom made it.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.200
It's from my country.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.560
The color is all right from me.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.359
This one is my favorite color.
