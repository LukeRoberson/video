00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:11.349
We don't know if it's going to be good, because it's going to come after us, if we don't go back to the country, if we don't go back to the country, we can go back to the country.

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:32.939
Hey you, are you ready?

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:42.450
The Haitian community in our area was growing, and the new Haitian Creole congregation was formed nearby.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.450
We checked out their territory and saw they needed a lot of help.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.950
So, should we do this?

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.950
I've been praying for more studies.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.950
I think this might just be my answer.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:58.950
Yeah, I'm in.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.950
Good. Then as soon as we get home, we can pray about it.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:08.060
Our new language was exciting.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.060
We spent every spare second we had trying to get better.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:22.700
We had so much joy, but we had challenges too.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.700
Could you read the next paragraph for us, please?

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:50.230
Yeah, sorry, where are we?

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.230
Our study was so nice today, wasn't it, Nicholas?

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:08.639
It was. And yet again, I was totally lost.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:14.639
We didn't realize that Niko just wasn't finding the answer.

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:20.639
To help Niko, we did a few more things in our language.

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:28.270
Besides family worship, we attended one meeting a month with our old congregation.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:34.780
Well, honestly, I'm a little worried about Niko.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.780
He's having a tough time adapting to our new congregation.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.780
I get it.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.780
You know, back when we first joined a foreign community,

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.780
everything was fun and new, but after a little while,

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.780
we noticed that our kids had lost their enthusiasm.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.780
They were still hearing about Jehovah,

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.780
but honestly, they weren't learning because it wasn't in their language.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.780
Is that why you moved back?

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.780
It was, but at every family is different.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.780
We each have to decide what's best for our own.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.780
Thanks. That's true.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.780
I found the perfect article to tell you about it.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.780
I found the perfect article to help us decide what to do.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.780
It mentioned the example of Daniel.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.780
He had to speak different languages every day,

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.340
but he made sure to study in Hebrew, his language.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.340
The article mentioned Psalm 111.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.340
In my heart, I treasure up your saying.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.340
For Niko to treasure God's word in his heart,

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.340
we felt he needed even more guidance in the language of his heart.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:55.479
The truth is, when I'm at the meeting in my language, it's different.

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:58.479
I don't have to think a lot just to understand what I'm hearing.

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:01.479
Well, I think it's clear what's best for our family.

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:02.479
It is.

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:04.479
But what about your students?

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:07.479
It's okay, Niko. We'll find a way to help them.

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:10.479
The language we're immersed in every day is the language of your heart,

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:15.479
so it's best for you to keep growing spiritually in that same language.

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:22.790
It was the best decision in order for Niko to stay close to Jehovah.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:31.129
But we did miss the Haitian Creole field, so a few years later.

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:33.129
Are you ready?

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:36.129
I'm a little nervous, but I think I'm ready.

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:45.500
We decided it was the right time to move back.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:55.500
We're so glad our decision helped Niko build a solid foundation for his faith and his future.
