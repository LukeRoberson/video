00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:13.980
I started to make a lot of friends at school, and aside from school, I began learning how

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.699
to roll a blade, so whenever I'd go out to practice, I'd meet lots of different people.

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.980
I made some mistakes because of bad associations.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.980
We started going out at night and maybe just drinking a little alcohol, but eventually

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.300
we were drinking a lot.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.100
By the time I realized what was happening, I was already really involved.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.859
I was 17 years old.

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:38.939
I started being close friends with them.

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:42.939
They were everything to me, and I really trusted them.

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:48.539
They were doing some wrong things like drugs and using bad language, but I thought I'm

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:58.549
just with them, as long as I don't do what they're doing, it's not a problem.

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:03.750
I began to make excuses saying that it didn't really matter and that there was anything

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.549
wrong with what I was doing.

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.510
My spiritual routine was just going to the meetings.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.709
I started missing some meetings.

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:11.709
I never prayed.

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:14.189
I didn't even know how to do personal study.

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.709
I wasn't reading the Bible every day.

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:22.469
In this group of friends, there was a boy who liked me and asked me out.

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:25.750
And since all my friends were dating, I thought, why not?

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.549
So I started dating him and my parents had no idea.

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.189
I'd lie about where I was going, what I'd be doing, and who I'd be with.

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.829
I was pretty much two completely different people.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.390
At home, I was one way and with my friends, I was another.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.310
I tried to pray to Jehovah, but I just couldn't.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.750
I felt ashamed because I knew inside that Jehovah wasn't happy with what I was doing.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.560
My conscience really bothered me.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.519
There was a moment when my boyfriend and then some of those friends really let me down.

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:06.040
I began thinking about how I didn't have anyone else in my life.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.599
One time we were all drinking and this girl invited us all to go to our house.

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:17.759
I started thinking about what might happen if I said yes to that girl's invitation.

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:25.159
I knew that there'd be drinking, drugs, and maybe even something immoral might happen.

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:31.439
So after having not prayed for a really long time, I closed my eyes and said, Jehovah,

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:34.159
please help me.

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:39.120
I'm just so alone, I don't have anyone.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.919
I felt completely abandoned by everyone.

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:47.639
So right then and there, I said I prayed to Jehovah, asking him that if he would help

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:52.800
me to say no, from that day forward I would stop associating with those friends and serve

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.560
him whole-sold.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.000
Many times I asked Jehovah to forgive me, I said, Jehovah, you're the only one I have.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.560
Please help me, and that's exactly what happened.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.400
After saying that prayer, I felt determined to leave.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.840
I started thinking about everything that I'd done and how I was putting not only my own

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.879
life at risk, but also my relationship with Jehovah.

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:19.759
I thought I'm going to talk to the elders.

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:25.400
Since I'm a very shy person, the thought of confessing my mistakes was really difficult.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.919
I talked to them and I told them everything that happened.

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:32.719
It was like a weight had been lifted off me.

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:35.759
I saw that I really wasn't alone after all.

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:41.000
I still remember a scripture that they read to me at Psalm 86.5, which showed me that

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.719
Jehovah's forgiveness has no limits if I'm truly repentant.

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:48.479
So I knew that Jehovah would forgive me, but the elders also told me that I'd have to

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:53.080
tell my parents, which was very difficult.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:04.229
I thought, well, I need to speak up, and I just opened up and told them about what happened.

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:08.469
I decided that I was going to talk with an elder, and he read a scripture with me from

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:14.870
Philippians 4.7, which says that the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.709
guard our hearts.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.790
So I was able to pray again, knowing that if I really changed, I could feel that peace

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.509
that comes from Jehovah.

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:27.949
I started studying the Bible for real.

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:32.870
I stopped associating with those friends and started being more involved in spiritual

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.269
things.

00:04:34.269 --> 00:04:38.629
I had the privilege of getting baptized and becoming a regular pioneer, and today I'm

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:39.629
serving in Bethel.

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:44.389
I had the privilege of being invited to help with construction projects, but my greatest

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:51.829
privilege is the strong friendship that I have with Jehovah, and also having true friends.

00:04:51.829 --> 00:04:55.509
I've seen that Jehovah has always been by my side.

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:59.509
And even when I didn't want to be with him, Jehovah never abandoned me.
