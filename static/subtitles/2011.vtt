00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.759
and introduction to the book of Joel.

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:09.759
Joel prophesied to the two tribe Kingdom of Judah

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:11.759
during the 9th century BCE,

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.759
and he appears to have recorded his prophecies

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.760
about 820 BCE in the days of King Azaya.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.760
Joel was a contemporary of the prophet's Jonah and Amos.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.760
The book contains three chapters,

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.760
and it warns of the approaching day of Jehovah.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.759
Chapters 1 and 2 mention a locust plague

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:36.759
that will devastate the land,

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:39.759
leaving famine in its wake.

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:42.759
The locusts have teeth like those of a lion.

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:44.759
They run like horses,

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:46.759
scale walls like soldiers,

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:50.759
and sound like chariots charging into battle.

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:54.759
Although false worship flourishes in Jerusalem and Judah,

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:57.759
Jehovah will not let the rebellious conduct

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:59.759
of the people continue.

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:04.760
Judah's only hope lies in repenting and turning to Jehovah.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.760
Did you know?

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.760
The Apostle Paul quoted Joel when he said,

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.760
everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.760
Calling on God's name involves knowing Him,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.760
trusting Him, obeying Him,

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.260
and putting Him first in our life.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
In chapter 3, the nations are called to account

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
for mistreating God's people.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
There to be crushed like grapes and a winepress.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.629
Then, Jehovah promises future kingdom blessings,

00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:42.629
both physical and spiritual.

00:01:42.629 --> 00:01:44.629
In heaven and on earth,

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:50.379
all will be united in pure worship.

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:52.379
As you study the book of Joel,

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:57.379
note how those who make themselves enemies of God fair badly.

00:01:57.379 --> 00:02:02.379
How different the outcome is for those who repent and return to Him.

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:05.379
And how Joel's prophecy finds fulfillment

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:08.379
in the proclamation of God's kingdom.
