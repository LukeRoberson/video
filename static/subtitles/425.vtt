00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:08.679
You know, a very simple way to visualize Romans chapter 12 and verse two is to use a rock and a clay.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.339
Now, we want to be like a rock in Satan's hands,

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.379
resisting his molding, but we want to be like clay in

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:20.879
Jehovah's hands.

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:27.660
Now, being like a rock in Satan's hands really represents the first part of Romans chapter 12 and verse two

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.980
that says, stop being molded by this system of things.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:40.539
And being clay in Jehovah's hands is very similar to the thought in the rest of Romans chapter 12 and verse two that says,

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:45.060
be transformed by making your mind over.

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:52.780
Now, to illustrate the difference between our reaction when Satan tries to shape and mold us with the system of things

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:58.140
versus when Jehovah wants to, I'd like you to think of maybe you're in a public place,

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:05.180
you're at a shopping mall or some place, and a perfect stranger walks up behind you and starts

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.780
to massage your shoulders. What would you do? You would stiffen up and say, get away,

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.340
what are you doing? But if someone you love and trust does that, well, you might relax and have a

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:25.260
very different reaction, right? So what is our reaction when Satan wants to try and shape and mold us?

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.019
It's being like a rock, but when Jehovah wants to shape and mold us, we want to be like clay.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:39.739
Now, let's consider one rock-like quality that we need to resist Satan's shaping and molding of us,

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:46.540
and that's a courage. To start that discussion on courage, let's open our Bibles to a very

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:54.379
straightforward, simple statement in Psalm 56 and verse 3. Psalm 56 and verse 3.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:03.420
It says, when I am afraid, I put my trust in you. So Satan uses fear and intimidation,

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:11.020
persecution to get us to change our relationship with a Jehovah, to try and break our integrity,

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:18.139
to stop us from worshipping Jehovah. Now, when you read the accounts in J. W. News about our

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:25.020
brothers in Russia, I'm sure all of us have some reactions where you're thinking, wow, how would I

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:32.860
deal with that kind of persecution? Or if you're a wife, maybe you think, now, how would I deal with

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:40.780
my husband being put into prison and having these kinds of things done to him? Yes, in many

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.900
ways, we are very proud of the courage, the rock-like qualities that our brothers are showing when

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:54.219
Satan tries to shape and mold them. I was particularly moved when I read the account about the

00:02:54.219 --> 00:03:00.539
brothers and sisters in Russia in Ornberg, and here a group of brothers and sisters boldly went

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:05.900
to the prison, identified themselves as Jehovah's Witnesses, at some risk of their own freedom,

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:12.460
and wanted to know how their brothers were being treated in the prison. Aren't we really

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.979
truly proud of those kind of rock-like qualities that we see in our brothers and sisters?

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:26.460
But now, it also takes courage to resist other kinds of ways that Satan is trying to mold and shape

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:33.819
us. It takes courage, for example, to change the channel, or to click the mouse away from bad

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:41.099
entertainment. Are we rock-like in that kind of courage? It takes courage to face sickness or

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:48.620
terminal illness, and have the rock-like hope and strength that there is going to be a resurrection.

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:55.099
It takes courage to watch the news these days, and see all that is going on in the world,

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:00.780
and keep our rock-like courage in faith that there is a new world coming, and that the end of this

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:09.819
system is coming. So the lesson for us is, are we like a rock in Satan's hands, or is it possible

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:17.100
that we have become soft and comfortable in this system of things? Now, how are we doing about

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:31.149
being clay in Jehovah's hands? Isaiah chapter 64 and verse 8 helps us with this discussion about

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:37.149
the clay, because it shows the choice that we've made. Isaiah chapter 64 and verse 8.

00:04:38.829 --> 00:04:47.069
It says, but now, Jehovah, you are our Father. We are the clay, and you are our Potter. We are all

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:52.509
the work of your hands. Now, sometimes when I've heard this read, sometimes people say, we are the

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:59.870
clay, and you are the Potter. But really, that word hour is very important. We are the clay, and you are

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:07.790
our Potter. That means that we've made a choice. That Jehovah is the one to shape and mold us.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:14.990
Now, imagine clay that you go to shape and mold it, and it says, oh, hey, don't do that. Hey,

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.589
I don't want to look like that. Don't change me like, okay, okay, okay.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:28.269
What kind of reaction are we having when Jehovah is trying to shape and mold us?

00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:34.430
Well, let's consider two clay-like qualities that we can have when Jehovah is trying to shape and

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:43.069
mold us. First of all, obedience. Now, it's clear to all of us that Jehovah is shaping and molding

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:49.629
and preparing us for the end of this system of things, and the events that are leading directly

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:57.790
up to the great tribulation. So, will we be obedient when we get direction? How to preach? How to

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:04.750
do our meetings? What assignment we may have during that turbulent time? You know, yesterday,

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.310
Brothers Plain made some excellent comments about King Solomon. Now, King Solomon had some divine

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:15.149
instruction, but he ignored it, and he basically said, well, you know, I can marry lots of foreign

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:19.149
wives, and it's not going to have any effect on me. We don't want to have that kind of attitude

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:26.350
when it comes to divine instruction, or we could be like an athlete who hires a coach, pays them

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:30.910
lots of money, and says, what can I do to be better? And the athlete says, well, you know, I'm

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:36.589
the professional athlete. I really don't need to listen to what you have to say. So, Jehovah is giving

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:43.790
us counsel and advice we want to listen. For example, this virus that is spreading around is giving

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:50.670
us an opportunity to see about being obedient. We have many rules or guidelines that are being set

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:58.269
for us. We may be quarantined. We may have trips and other things canceled. We may be told to

00:06:58.269 --> 00:07:08.670
wash our hands, to not shake hands, but elbow bump. Now, of course, we can try hard to be obedient

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:15.149
to those rules and guidelines, but we also have an opportunity to not be just obedient to rules and

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:21.550
guidelines, but be obedient to the principles behind them. And in this case, often the principle

00:07:22.269 --> 00:07:27.790
is love of neighbor. We're trying to look out for others with these rules and guidelines when

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:33.709
it comes to the virus. And really, when you think about it, any of the opportunities we have now,

00:07:33.709 --> 00:07:40.990
it's a time to practice being obedient. It really view it as training for us. We have an

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:47.709
opportunity to practice being obedient for the future. It's at times like this that we can set a

00:07:47.709 --> 00:07:55.709
pattern of obedience because with time and effort and practice, we can make obedience our first

00:07:55.709 --> 00:08:03.709
reaction rather than a second reaction. Well, what's another clay-like quality that we could have

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:11.949
is spiritual focus. Today, Jehovah is making it perfectly clear that we're living in the last days.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:16.910
Now, the people of Noah's time, they took no note of the time they were living in. They didn't

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:24.189
have that clay-like quality, and they were swept away. I saw a video recently of an athlete doing

00:08:24.189 --> 00:08:28.990
a track meet. They were running a race around a track, and this one athlete when he crossed the

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:33.870
finish line, he throws his hands up, and he was absolutely jubilant that he had won the race.

00:08:34.509 --> 00:08:38.350
But then he didn't see anybody cheering for him, and the rest of the runners were running.

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.909
He was too early. It was one more lap to go.

00:08:44.909 --> 00:08:51.950
He lost track of where he was. He didn't know that that wasn't the last lap.

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:57.789
Well, we don't want to lose track of where we are in the race for life.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:05.950
We're so busy with doing other things. Let the fact that we're living in the last of the

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:13.070
last days, influence our day-to-day decisions become clay-like, moldable, that we're living

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:19.149
in the last days. Pay attention to the Bible principles that are mentioned to us in the watchtower

00:09:19.149 --> 00:09:24.110
and our meetings, and have good spiritual conversations, and those conversations can help to

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:27.149
remind us of the time in which we're living.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:36.990
So the lesson for us is you have chosen Jehovah to be your Potter. So be good, obedient,

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:44.830
spiritually focused clay in his hands. Yes, we need to be like a rock in Satan's hands,

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:54.830
and we need to be like clay in Jehovah's hands.
