00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:08.589
I hated the world situation, there was so much suffering, and I always had so many questions,

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:16.109
why are we here? What is it all about? What is the purpose? Is there really a God? Is there

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:23.070
could he allow all of this? So I opened the window and I stuck my head out and I said,

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.870
if you're there, I want you to know how I feel about you. I was raised in a religious Jewish

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:36.909
family in the Bronx. My parents viewed money as security and they worked seven days a week.

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:43.630
That really affected us as children a lot. I was a child, let on the loose. I was running the streets.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.549
And so I started using drugs and I started selling drugs and I was getting in every kind of trouble.

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.750
And so they moved us out to Long Island hoping things would be better.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:05.709
But I would take a taxi back into New York City every day. But one of the drivers was named Joe

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:15.549
and we hit it off and I wound up marrying him. My father was so so upset, I married, I'm pregnant.

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.909
I said to him, I'm moving out and he said to me, don't look back because this is final.

00:01:21.629 --> 00:01:28.590
So my family had disowned me. I was a new mother with a baby and I was really hurting.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:37.390
So I remember one day looking out the window and seeing this little old man come up my stairs

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.310
and he was carrying a little blue book and he came to my door and he went to 25 cents for that book.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.950
The truth that leads to eternal life. And I didn't really care about the book,

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.510
but something made me want to give that little old man that quarter. Right away chapter 4 caught my

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:59.709
attention why we grow old and die. And I read the entire chapter and I thought it just made sense.

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:06.750
I can't wait to share this with Joe when he comes home. He just lost his temper. He went out of control.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.349
He did not want to hear about Joe's witnesses. This is not that important. This book was really not

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.990
that important. I didn't want it to begin with. And so I just dropped it in the trash can and thought

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.990
that's the end of that. It's gone. But that little old man came back with a young sister.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.110
And Joe was there cutting an orange with a knife and he was not happy to see those people again.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.550
He took that knife and he waved it in front of the sister's face and he said, I don't want you

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.469
here at the house. She ran to the door and she said, no problem. I will definitely not be back.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.590
And they left and I thought, I really don't think they'll be back.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:52.189
But they did come back an elderly sister who had a Jewish background. And I said to her, can you not

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:58.909
take a hint that I am not interested in speaking with you? And she said, I get that. I get that.

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:06.590
But I really would love to ask you just one question. I thought, okay, there's no harm in letting her

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:14.830
ask me one question. She opened up the green Bible to the cover page where it has the tetragramaton,

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:22.830
Jehovah's name in Hebrew. And she said, will you just say this name for me? I thought to myself,

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.949
I'm not going to say that name. Jewish people don't say that name. I have never ever said that name.

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:36.590
But finally, I did. I said Yehovah. For the very first time, I said the name Jehovah.

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:42.669
And I was like, so shocked, you know, I was just waiting for something terrible to happen.

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:49.389
And then she told me that the name Jehovah was in the Bible about 7,000 times.

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:56.990
As soon as she left, I went and got out my Hebrew Bible. And I was going to look for that name,

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:02.990
Jehovah and circle it if it was there. So I started to do that. I went through the first page

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:09.229
with the second page and I realized as I flipped through the Bible, it's everywhere. The name Jehovah

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:15.789
was everywhere. I thought, I have got to share this with Joe. And Joe was really impressed. He was

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:23.470
really softening. It made a difference. A week later, she comes back because she wanted to show me

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.790
a prophecy in the Hebrew Scriptures in Daniel chapter 9. She called it the 70 weeks of year's

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:35.550
prophecy. And for the first time, I could see that there was a real answer to when the Messiah

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:44.160
would come and what would be the results on the earth. Seeing those prophecies really motivated

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:51.199
me to want to know more. I thought to myself, if all of these prophecies are from God and he's

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:57.519
fulfilling all of them, what other prophecies are there? What other wonderful things do we have

00:04:57.519 --> 00:05:07.019
to look forward to? My relationship with Jehovah just got better and better. And we were baptized

00:05:07.019 --> 00:05:16.060
together on December 2nd, 1972. I came to really appreciate and love Bible prophecy. I started

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:22.379
doing a lot of research and a lot of study on my own. I loved getting to know Jehovah as a person

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:31.019
who wants such good things for us. Everything he wants, everything he asks of us is for our benefit.

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:40.060
It just really touched me to the core. My life is so full now with blessings from Jehovah.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:49.870
I love that name. There's no more beautiful name in the world than Jehovah.
