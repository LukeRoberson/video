00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:15.250
The Apostle Paul wrote to Christians in Thessalonica.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:22.890
We became gentle in your midst, as when a nursing mother tenderly cares for her own children.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.350
So having tender affection for you, we would determine to impart to you not only the good

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:36.170
news of God, but also are very selves because you became so beloved to us.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.090
Paul cared, and his fellow believers could sense that by the way he spoke to them.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.369
This made his teaching more effective.

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:51.130
Likewise, if our audience feels that we genuinely care for them, that we're not there simply

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:58.850
to deliver information or fulfill an assignment, they'll be more likely to listen and respond.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.689
So how can we show genuine warmth and empathy?

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:06.530
We need to think about our listeners.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.650
For example, before going in the ministry reflect on specific problems that people in the

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.329
territory are concerned about.

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:17.250
What are their beliefs?

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.890
Try to imagine how they feel.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.010
When preparing a talk, remind yourself of what your brothers and sisters may be facing

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.650
and how you can encourage them.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.609
Then use expressions that refresh, comfort, and invigorate your listeners.

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:40.730
Be careful not to speak disparagingly of people or their beliefs.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:48.049
When conversing with older people or those in authority, use words that show respect.

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.450
Let's watch a brother giving a public talk.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.969
Do his words show empathy for his audience?

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:02.170
The evolution theory is very popular today, but it's hard to understand how intelligent

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.409
people could believe such an illogical theory.

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:12.889
Many believe it's simply because so-called educated people do, including many scientists.

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:18.169
So how can we help them to examine matters for themselves and see how ridiculous evolution

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:20.530
is?

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.449
And somewhat in the audience believed in evolution, how would he feel?

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:32.250
Let's watch the speaker try again, but this time with more empathy.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:39.330
The evolution theory is very popular today, but why do many people believe it?

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:46.370
Perhaps they were taught evolution in school, and were offered no other plausible explanation.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.330
How can we help people to examine the facts for themselves?

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.129
This time, the speaker didn't insult people because of their viewpoint.

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:03.330
At the same time, he aroused interest in additional facts that are worthy of consideration.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.770
What else can indicate warmth and empathy?

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:08.770
Toned.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.569
Not just what you say, but how you say it.

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:20.289
A warm tone of voice along with appropriate gestures and facial expressions shows sincere

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:22.409
interest.

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:26.250
Let's watch a publisher in the House to House Ministry.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.169
Does she show interest by the way she speaks?

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:31.250
I'm sorry.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.969
I can't talk to you today.

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:37.650
I just lost my mother, and I'm meeting with the funeral director this afternoon.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.650
I'm sorry.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.409
It's so painful when a loved one dies.

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:49.569
When I lost my mother a few years ago, I found some Bible verses to be very comforting.

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.689
Although there was nothing wrong with what our sisters said, her delivery lacked warmth

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:56.689
and empathy.

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:59.969
Let's give her a second chance.

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:01.770
I'm sorry.

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.409
It's so painful when a loved one dies.

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:11.889
When I lost my mother a few years ago, I found some Bible verses to be very comforting.

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:19.870
Some of them are in this tract, but maybe we can discuss them briefly another time.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:26.470
Our sisters said exactly the same thing, but this time she spoke with emotion, and so

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.750
her words were more effective.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.509
When we speak with genuine emotion, we show our listeners that we care.

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:39.670
But be careful not to force or exaggerate emotions.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:45.310
If you're reading a scripture, try to express the feelings indicated in the passage, but

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.910
don't draw undue attention to yourself.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:57.269
So by thinking about your listeners, choosing your words carefully, and showing your interest,

00:04:57.269 --> 00:05:01.709
you'll refresh, comfort, and invigorate your listeners.
