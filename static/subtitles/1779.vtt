00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.540
Growing up in Canada, I had a view of what hospitality was.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.380
Hospitality was, have the brothers and sisters over, get to know them, share a meal together,

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.220
something that I planned to offer to them.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:21.899
I don't think I ever realized how much I had been influenced by my own culture and defining

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:26.179
when I thought hospitality was.

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.379
There has a very big effect on us.

00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:33.060
In our culture, young ones are not trusted very much.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.140
They are not given responsibility.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.460
I have seen the effect of the culture inside the congregation, especially when the question

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.100
of giving younger ones more privileges of service or assignments came up.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.340
When it was discussed among the elders, it would not really be considered.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.859
And so the desire would be for him to wait a little bit longer.

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:58.460
Not sure a little more, gain more life experience.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.619
I also thought the same way.

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:05.980
When I looked back now, I realized that it really wasn't right because Jehovah's thinking

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.780
isn't like that.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:16.659
When I attended the special convention in Ukraine, my view of what hospitality was changed completely.

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.180
When we get off the plane, all the brothers are there.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.180
We see the love we're overwhelmed by, just the quantity of the brothers that are there.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.299
Their smiles, their expressions.

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:36.939
As the days went on, it was clear they were just looking for what we needed.

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:41.260
And it was more than just giving us some food and spending some time with us.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:47.260
There were so many other things that they did that covered every one of our needs when

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.140
I'm not sure that their own needs were being covered at times.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.939
They knew they just wanted to be there and they'd figure out the rest when they got there.

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.420
And that really impressed myself and my wife.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:09.300
I do remember one night getting back to the hotel and we had a moment to just really think

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.460
about what we'd seen that day and started to ask ourselves if we'd ever gone to the

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.460
same extent.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.099
Where I'm from, I feel we tend to stick with what we're very comfortable with.

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:29.259
I realized that I really had unknowingly been putting limits on hospitality because of

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:34.620
what I was comfortable with, because of the culture where I grew up.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.620
Whereas the experience in Ukraine helped me to see that we can break that barrier down

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.580
so much faster.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.620
We could definitely feel that this was what Jehovah's U of hospitality was.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.860
It was about looking for what others need and filling those needs.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.020
In time, my thinking changed because I realized Jehovah's way of thinking.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.460
The videos produced by Jehovah's organization and what I watched in them helped my view

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.379
to change.

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:11.580
I could actually see what a young brother or a young elder could do.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.500
From the past, we used to focus on experience.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.580
I would too, but now Jehovah's viewpoint is more important than just experience.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.379
Jehovah doesn't only focus on experience, but also on spiritual qualities.

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:29.620
I came to realize that.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:36.219
So after we experienced the special convention in Ukraine and returned home, we decided

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:39.860
we need to consider this more as a family worship project.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.340
We realized we did have to make some adjustments.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.460
We realized we did want to do more.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:54.259
So we had to set specific goals to be able to strip away our previous definition of hospitality

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:58.460
and start extending it beyond what we were comfortable with.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:07.580
It takes work to continually break free from the limits that we might set for ourselves.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.900
And it was something we realized we need to make some changes if we were going to maintain

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.660
Jehovah's you of hospitality moving forward.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.980
Of course, the influence of the culture doesn't go away overnight.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.819
We still need to work hard on it.

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:30.379
We still have to change because traces of the culture can still be left over.

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:35.459
But I realized we definitely need to get rid of it.

00:04:35.459 --> 00:04:40.459
Now I'm really pleased to serve with those young brothers, to talk with them and to see

00:04:40.459 --> 00:04:44.379
their potential as Jehovah season.

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:49.939
We can also see that Jehovah is very pleased too.

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:52.699
Jehovah's overjoyed.

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.660
He's proud to see what those young brothers do.
