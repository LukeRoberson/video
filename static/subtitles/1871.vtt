WEBVTT

00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:16.429
So now, brothers, we ask you to give your full attention to this musical interlude, which has been prepared especially for our annual meeting today, and we are certain that you are going to be delighted with what you're about to hear.

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:53.039
The maturity, shine the light of the truth, so that all make plainly seem, try your best to withstand God for true success.

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:05.819
There's a place in the service for what puts a thought that you may not fall.

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:33.590
Witnessing, everlasting good news to all sorts of people, bring joy and embrace to Jehovah God and King.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.590
As we preach from God to know.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.129
Those words I must have been.

00:01:41.129 --> 00:03:31.539
Is that like some?

00:03:31.539 --> 00:08:24.370
Brothers and sisters, welcome.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:32.370
Welcome to this historic annual meeting of the Watchtower Bible and Track Society of Pennsylvania.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:43.370
And we're delighted that all of you have arranged your circumstances to travel from all over the world to be present with us to mark this very, very special occasion.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:47.370
Well, to begin, we have some reminders.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:53.370
It is requested that no flash cameras be used during the program.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:59.370
Any picture taken without flash must be taken from your seat location.

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:03.370
No recordings of any kind are permitted.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:13.370
Cellular telephones, electronic tablets or similar devices should not be used to transmit any part of the program.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:20.370
Program notes whether hard copy or electronic should not be distributed to others.

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:24.370
Okay, so we got the housekeeping done.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.370
So now we can begin our meeting.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:32.370
If you would all like to stand, we're going to join together in singing a very appropriate song.

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.370
Song number 30, Jehovah begins his rule.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:42.370
And then following the song, Brother Viv Moritz of the Austral Asia branch will open with prayer.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:44.370
Song number 30.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:13:31.269
As our song began, this is indeed a glorious day.

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:41.269
It was 100 years ago that our dear brother Charles Tase Russell walked into the dining room at 124 Columbia Heights.

00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:45.269
He clapped his hands three times.

00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:50.269
And he said, the Gentile times have ended.

00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:53.269
Their kings have had their day.

00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:58.269
Well, no doubt what an exciting moment that must have been.

00:13:58.269 --> 00:14:10.269
What it had been thrilling to be present at that moment to hear Brother Russell make that historic and earth-changing announcement.

00:14:10.269 --> 00:14:18.269
Well, of course, Brother Russell and the early Bible students did not completely understand the significance of what had taken place.

00:14:18.269 --> 00:14:21.269
But we cannot say that today.

00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:27.269
We know exactly what took place at that time in 1914.

00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:29.269
Will you open your Bibles with me?

00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:35.269
And let's read together Revelation chapter 11 and verse 15.

00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:43.549
The seventh angel blew his trumpet.

00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:46.549
And there were loud voices in heaven saying,

00:14:46.549 --> 00:14:52.549
the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ.

00:14:52.549 --> 00:14:57.549
And he will rule as king forever and ever.

00:14:57.549 --> 00:15:05.549
Yes, we know that at that time our king Jesus Christ was enthroned in the heavens.

00:15:05.549 --> 00:15:12.549
And now today, 100 years later, after 100 years of kingdom rule,

00:15:12.549 --> 00:15:16.549
this is no dull anniversary.

00:15:16.549 --> 00:15:20.549
This is no event just to mark off on our calendar.

00:15:20.549 --> 00:15:33.549
This is a day for us as Jehovah's people to rejoice and to thank Jehovah for all of the things that he has accomplished over this past 100 years.

00:15:33.549 --> 00:15:39.549
Well, now we could go on and on talking about all of the kingdom's accomplishments.

00:15:39.549 --> 00:15:46.549
But perhaps let's just discuss three that are meaningful for us today.

00:15:46.549 --> 00:15:51.549
Here's the first, the global preaching work.

00:15:51.549 --> 00:15:58.549
Of course, Jesus said that the good news of God's kingdom would be preached in all the inhabited earth.

00:15:58.549 --> 00:16:05.549
Well, now in 1914, there were 5,150 publishers.

00:16:05.549 --> 00:16:09.549
How in the world would they accomplish this work?

00:16:09.549 --> 00:16:17.549
But as we think back, as we sit here today, we can remember our parents, our grandparents,

00:16:17.549 --> 00:16:21.549
our great grandparents, some of you perhaps even further back.

00:16:21.549 --> 00:16:30.549
And you remember how tirelessly these ones worked to preach the good news using every possible method.

00:16:30.549 --> 00:16:36.549
Brother Melvin Sargent, who was baptized in 1912, said this.

00:16:36.549 --> 00:16:42.549
Those of us inside the Lord's organization have tried in every way possible

00:16:42.549 --> 00:16:46.549
to turn the world's attention to the message of life.

00:16:46.549 --> 00:16:54.549
We have used slogans, full-page advertisements, radio, sound cars, portable phonographs,

00:16:54.549 --> 00:17:00.549
gigantic conventions, parades of information walkers carrying signs,

00:17:00.549 --> 00:17:04.549
and a growing army of house to house ministers.

00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:10.549
Well, maybe many of you who are here today had the privilege to share in some of those events.

00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:16.549
Well, all of that hard work has brought about wonderful fruitage.

00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:21.549
And I'm happy to tell you today that for the very first time,

00:17:21.549 --> 00:17:30.549
during the 2014 service year, our peak publishers have gone beyond the 8 million mark.

00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:43.380
Isn't that a cause to rejoice today?

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:50.380
And we also know at this point that our more moral attendance is more than 19.5 million.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.380
We don't have the exact figure for you.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:56.380
It won't be available for a couple more weeks.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:18:00.380
But isn't it wonderful what we do know to see how many have responded?

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:04.380
But brothers, the work is not finished.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:08.380
Through our public and house to house preaching and through our website,

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:13.380
we are reaching out to more people today than perhaps we ever thought was possible.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.380
Can you just imagine?

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:22.380
Our website now has been translated into 554 languages.

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:29.380
And publications are available on the website for download in 700 languages.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:33.380
Just during the months of August and September,

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:41.380
we have had 1.5 million unique visitors every single day to JW.org.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:44.380
Isn't that amazing to think about?

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:55.400
And so there is no question that the greatest preaching and disciple making work

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.400
that has ever been accomplished is happening now.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.400
It's more than we ever could have imagined that would be done.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:10.400
What a marvelous reason this is today to thank Jehovah for what he has accomplished.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.400
But now let's consider a second area.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:18.400
All of this global preaching work has not gone unnoticed.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:22.400
Jesus foretold in Matthew chapter 10 and verse 22,

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:28.400
you will be hated by all people on account of my name.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:33.400
But the one who is endured to the end will be saved.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:39.400
Well, in these past 100 years, we have experienced opposition of all kinds,

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:47.400
bannings, persecutions, imprisonments, even exile and concentration camps.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:54.400
Yet through it all, we as a nation have felt the protective care of Jehovah God.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:59.400
We think back to Hitler who railed against Jehovah's witnesses.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:06.400
On one occasion he screamed, this brood will be exterminated in Germany.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.400
But what do the facts show?

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.400
When the Nazis came to power in Germany,

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:16.400
there were approximately 10,000 witnesses in that country.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:22.400
But shortly after the war, in 1948, what did the numbers show?

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.400
They had doubled.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:29.400
We had 20,811 publishers.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:34.400
Hitler and his Nazi party had not exterminated Jehovah's people

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:39.400
despite the harsh persecution that he had brought on them.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:43.400
But quite frankly, who was gone?

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.400
It was Hitler and his Nazi party.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.400
They were long gone.

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.400
And what a victory that was for Jehovah.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:58.400
Well now, these victories have not just taken place in these totalitarian nations.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:02.400
During the 20th century, here in the United States,

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:08.400
Jehovah's witnesses won 50 victories in the United States Supreme Court,

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:14.400
guaranteeing and reinforcing the right to freedom of speech and freedom of religion.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:24.400
And in more recent times, we have prevailed in 57 applications presented to the European Court of Human Rights.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:31.400
That includes 31 outright victories and 26 friendly settlements.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:41.950
Well dear brothers, this truly reminds us of what the Psalmist said in Psalm 124.

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:45.950
Psalm 124 will begin rating in verse 2.

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:55.380
If Jehovah had not been with us when men rose up to attack us,

00:21:55.380 --> 00:22:01.380
then they would have swallowed us up alive when their anger was burning against us.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:04.380
Then the waters would have washed away.

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.380
The torrent would have swept over us.

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:10.380
The raging waters would have overwhelmed us.

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:17.380
Majorhovah be praised for he has not given us his prey to their teeth.

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:20.380
We are like a bird that escaped from the hunter's trap.

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:24.380
The trap was broken and we escaped.

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:30.380
Our help is in the name of Jehovah, the maker of heaven and earth.

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:37.380
Well how true those words have been over the last 100 years for Jehovah's people.

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:43.380
And truly, the protective care that Jehovah has given us as a people

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:48.380
is a reason for us to praise him and to thank him on this day.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:49.380
Would you not agree?

00:22:49.380 --> 00:23:07.660
But then brothers, we also for a moment should consider what Jehovah has accomplished with us as individuals.

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:10.660
Truly we are dust.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:15.660
And Jehovah has taken us from every walk of life and every background.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:20.660
First Corinthians chapter 6 verses 9 to 11, what does it tell us?

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:28.660
Well some of us previously were fornicators, adulterers, homosexuals, greedy persons, the list goes on and on.

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.660
But what has Jehovah done with us?

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:37.660
Through his word, through his Holy Spirit, we have been transformed.

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:44.660
And over this 100 years, Jehovah has brought about a nation of Christian men and women who are upright.

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:50.660
From every race, from every tribe, from every people, from every language.

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:55.660
And as we sit here today, in this audience, we see the evidence of it.

00:23:55.660 --> 00:24:03.660
As people of all races, nationalities, languages sit here as one family, as one people.

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:08.660
Brothers, this is a miracle that only Jehovah God could have achieved.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:29.460
So how thankful we are to Jehovah, that he brought us out of this very dark world and allowed us to be a part of his nation.

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:37.460
Quite honestly, brothers, quite honestly, where would any of us be today without Jehovah?

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:40.460
It's a question that we do well to ponder.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:53.460
Well, I'm sure you agree that in considering 100 years of kingdom rule, we have so many reasons to repeat the words of the psalmist here at Psalm 40 and verse 5.

00:24:53.460 --> 00:25:12.339
He said, how many things you have done, oh Jehovah my God, your wonderful works and your thoughts toward us, none can compare to you.

00:25:12.339 --> 00:25:18.339
If I were to try to tell and speak of them, they would be too numerous to recount.

00:25:18.339 --> 00:25:25.339
Well, we have to say that's the case of all the accomplishments of God's kingdom over this 100 years.

00:25:25.339 --> 00:25:38.339
Well, yes, it would have been exciting to be in that dining room 100 years ago at 124 Columbia Heights to hear brother Russell make that historic announcement.

00:25:38.339 --> 00:25:54.339
But quite frankly, I think we feel more excited, more honored, more privileged to be present for this occasion to mark the 100th anniversary of the rule of the kingdom.

00:25:54.339 --> 00:26:29.480
Well, I have to tell you, brothers, this annual meeting is going to be filled with numerous spiritual gifts and treasures.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:42.480
So, let's begin. Now, for the past three years, all of us have been delighted with the animated series of videos that are entitled Become Jehovah's Friend.

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:47.480
Now, most of the monthly installments, as you know, have just been one or two minutes in length.

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:59.480
However, a much longer program has been prepared by the governing body and they've arranged for the premier showing to take place here at the annual meeting.

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:19.259
Well, now, just before you watch this video program, I'm sure you're going to be delighted to hear comments of appreciation from our very precious little ones.

00:27:19.259 --> 00:27:29.309
Well, again, I appreciate feeling new for you and celebrating me all along.

00:27:29.309 --> 00:27:32.309
Me and my brother learnt to sing.

00:27:32.309 --> 00:27:36.309
Because I learned a lot of things from Caleb and Sophia.

00:27:36.309 --> 00:27:42.309
Okay, don't don't see, forget about it, and say sorry.

00:27:43.309 --> 00:27:49.309
If someone made me food, I would say thank you.

00:27:49.309 --> 00:28:07.309
I cleaned up like Caleb does and he just cleaned up his room just like this.

00:28:07.309 --> 00:28:17.309
And then when the car went through the hole, there was lots of shining like if people were taking pictures like...

00:28:17.309 --> 00:28:21.309
The teddy bear went flu!

00:28:21.309 --> 00:28:26.980
And then there was a tree.

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:28.980
Dad, my bear!

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:34.480
Oh, don't look very nice on the tree.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:42.480
Then Caleb showed us that magic drawing it being.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:47.480
He said, no, I don't want to have any of this stuff.

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:54.480
In school they like, they try to teach us about evolution.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:29:02.480
The video helped me to learn that to help us see me as...

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:09.480
If child was not real, all these things that we are doing now, we don't even happen.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:15.480
When you give us stuff to people, they feel happy.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:20.480
Also, when you give stuff to people, you feel happy.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:23.480
Do you follow what I've learned here?

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.480
When we get to the heart, right?

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:29.480
It brings a lot of joy, it doesn't matter if it's a present or a small one.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:36.519
Because giving isn't a nice way of seeing.

00:29:36.519 --> 00:29:47.160
I love you.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:54.160
With a lot of people that are against your horror, I've been sitting here over.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:30:05.160
How can you tell the organisation such good ideas for the children around the world and for me to know all about these things that you have taught us.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.160
It's so amazing.

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:18.160
Thank you for the videos because everything in the videos are good stuff.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:25.160
Thanks for the killer videos drama because they helped me to be a better sister.

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:31.160
I say, always give me these videos to learn about your horror.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.160
Thank you.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.160
Thank you, Jehovah.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:37.160
Thank you, Jehovah.

00:31:45.140 --> 00:33:03.329
I feel so bad for Zoe.

00:33:03.329 --> 00:33:04.329
Her grandma died.

00:33:04.329 --> 00:33:09.089
It's a tell her about Jehovah, but I got scared.

00:33:09.089 --> 00:33:13.329
I wish I was more brave.

00:33:13.329 --> 00:33:16.329
Sophia, you can be brave.

00:33:16.329 --> 00:33:23.109
Tell you what, let's work on a little project together.

00:33:23.109 --> 00:33:27.769
There's a little girl I want you to meet.

00:33:27.769 --> 00:33:33.700
She needed boldness, too.

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:37.690
Hey, she looks like me.

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:39.690
She's very much like you.

00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:41.690
What's her name?

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:44.690
Well, the Bible doesn't say.

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:47.690
She's in the Bible?

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:48.690
Yes.

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:50.690
Why is she scared?

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:58.690
She's in a strange place, far from home, surrounded by people who don't worship Jehovah.

00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:08.349
She was taken from her family and forced to work in the home of a mighty warrior called Naaman.

00:34:08.349 --> 00:34:20.079
Life as a slave was very hard, especially for a little girl.

00:34:20.079 --> 00:34:31.059
The warrior was a mighty man and fearless.

00:34:31.059 --> 00:34:35.059
He had defeated many enemies in battle.

00:34:35.059 --> 00:34:39.019
Now he was sick.

00:34:39.019 --> 00:34:44.019
His illness was like an enemy he could not defeat.

00:34:44.019 --> 00:34:47.019
No one in the land knew how to help him.

00:34:47.019 --> 00:35:00.179
You staring at it.

00:35:00.179 --> 00:35:11.010
Get back to work.

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:13.010
Master, so sick.

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:15.010
There's no hope left in the end.

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:18.010
None of the gods have cured his illness.

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:19.010
Jehovah, can?

00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:20.010
What did you say?

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:22.010
I said Jehovah.

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:24.010
Never say that name here.

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:26.010
Don't you know where you are?

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:29.010
We don't worship your God of Israel.

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:38.820
These are our gods.

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:40.820
You must learn to keep silent.

00:35:40.820 --> 00:36:27.519
Master, I know what can help.

00:36:27.519 --> 00:36:34.000
You must know what can help.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:41.989
Can I get you some more food?

00:36:41.989 --> 00:36:58.000
Fine.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000
Jehovah, I'm scared.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000
I miss my mom and dad.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
Mom told me I could always call on you for help.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000
But nobody here wants me to talk about you.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Jehovah, I know you can help me in it.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.340
Please make him better so he can play with his kids.

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:24.340
Please help me be brave so I can tell him about you.

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:46.500
You must learn to keep silent.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:55.230
I know who can help your husband.

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:59.230
Jehovah, the God of Israel, my God.

00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:03.230
His prophet can heal your husband.

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:05.230
He must go to him.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:39:17.110
Hear myself.

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:31.789
No, there is no other God anywhere.

00:39:31.789 --> 00:39:32.789
Only Jehovah.

00:39:32.789 --> 00:39:37.059
Thank you little one.

00:39:37.059 --> 00:39:53.630
Thank you for telling me about him.

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:56.630
She didn't know what was going to happen after she spoke up.

00:39:56.630 --> 00:40:03.010
But she knew, no matter what happened, Jehovah would be with her.

00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:07.010
And Jehovah will be with you too, Sophia.

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:10.010
I'll never be as brave as her.

00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:12.010
Of course you will, Sophia.

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:14.010
You just need a little practice.

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:18.010
And then you will be bold too.

00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:20.010
Do you remember what we're doing tonight?

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:21.010
Family worship?

00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:23.010
Right.

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:27.010
Maybe tonight we can make a pretend classroom in the kitchen.

00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:30.739
I can be Zoe.

00:40:30.739 --> 00:40:42.630
And dad and Caleb can be the other kids.

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:45.630
You can practice being bold with us.

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:50.630
And then tomorrow you'll be all set for Zoe.

00:40:50.630 --> 00:41:03.059
I thought I couldn't be brave.

00:41:03.059 --> 00:41:07.059
But I learned from the little Hebrew girl.

00:41:07.059 --> 00:41:09.059
She was just like me.

00:41:09.059 --> 00:41:13.059
And Jehovah helped her be brave.

00:41:13.059 --> 00:41:15.059
I'm sorry I bet you're grandma.

00:41:15.059 --> 00:41:17.059
This is for you.

00:41:17.059 --> 00:41:19.059
It will help you feel better.

00:41:19.059 --> 00:41:23.039
Thank you.

00:41:23.039 --> 00:41:26.059
See ya.

00:41:26.059 --> 00:41:38.190
Bye.

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:40.190
Wanna see what I was reading on the bus?

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:41.190
Sure.

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:43.190
This book teaches about Jehovah.

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:44.190
Jehovah?

00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:46.190
Yeah, that's God's name.

00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:49.190
It tells us about a happy future for the earth.

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:52.190
Plus there's a bunch of pictures in here to help you learn about him.

00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:59.539
Wanna tell people at school about Jehovah?

00:41:59.539 --> 00:42:04.539
If I'm ever afraid, I know he'll help me.

00:42:04.539 --> 00:42:08.179
Because he's my friend.

00:42:08.179 --> 00:42:54.329
From Jehovah.

00:42:54.329 --> 00:43:12.320
Well, I'm pleased to tell you that this video will be posted on jw.org

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:15.320
on Monday, October 6th.

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:16.320
But get this.

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:19.320
In more than 20 languages.

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:21.320
Isn't that wonderful?

00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:33.659
Well, now, back in 1922, the Golden Age carried a very fascinating

00:43:33.659 --> 00:43:34.659
climate.

00:43:34.659 --> 00:43:35.659
Here's what it said.

00:43:35.659 --> 00:43:37.659
Very, very far sighted.

00:43:37.659 --> 00:43:42.659
Someday, each individual may carry in his vest pocket his own

00:43:42.659 --> 00:43:46.659
private wireless telephone, through which he can receive

00:43:46.659 --> 00:43:51.659
reliable news from various parts of the earth and communicate

00:43:51.659 --> 00:43:56.659
at will with private individuals wherever they may be.

00:43:56.659 --> 00:44:01.659
Then, too, the necessity for the phonograph will be practically

00:44:01.659 --> 00:44:02.659
eliminated.

00:44:02.659 --> 00:44:09.099
Well, now, those were far sighted comments, weren't they?

00:44:09.099 --> 00:44:14.099
But now, fast forwarding to 2014 isn't it amazing to see how such

00:44:14.099 --> 00:44:19.099
devices are being used more and more in our theocratic activities?

00:44:19.099 --> 00:44:25.099
Well, in that regard, we have a very exciting announcement for you.

00:44:25.099 --> 00:44:30.099
When the Christian congregation was established in 33 CE,

00:44:30.099 --> 00:44:34.099
Jehovah clearly indicated his purpose that people of all

00:44:34.099 --> 00:44:38.099
languages would be given opportunity to hear the good news.

00:44:38.099 --> 00:44:42.099
Therefore, we want to do everything in our power to preach to honest

00:44:43.099 --> 00:44:48.099
hearted persons from every nation, tribe and people in tongue.

00:44:48.099 --> 00:44:53.099
Well, thousands of publishers have been willing to accept this

00:44:53.099 --> 00:44:59.099
challenge and have taken on the work of learning another language.

00:44:59.099 --> 00:45:03.099
While there are secular language learning tools available,

00:45:03.099 --> 00:45:08.099
these are limited because they do not teach theocratic terminology.

00:45:08.099 --> 00:45:13.099
Well, you'll be happy to know that the governing body is releasing today

00:45:13.099 --> 00:45:17.099
the JW Language App.

00:45:17.099 --> 00:45:44.179
This theocratic language app covers areas that are most relevant for

00:45:44.179 --> 00:45:45.179
witnesses.

00:45:45.179 --> 00:45:50.179
By focusing on key topics like the Ministry, meetings and doctrine,

00:45:50.179 --> 00:45:54.179
we increase the likelihood that language students will be motivated

00:45:54.179 --> 00:45:59.179
to immediately put their new language skills to use in the ministry.

00:46:00.179 --> 00:46:04.179
So, please now give your attention to the following short video

00:46:04.179 --> 00:46:08.179
which is going to introduce the JW Language App.

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:32.510
This application covers over 4,000 theocratic words and phrases

00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:37.510
in 18 different languages that are spoken by more than half

00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:40.510
of the earth's population.

00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:43.510
In time, we hope to add additional words and phrases,

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:48.510
field service presentations and other features that can be used in learning

00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:49.510
a new language.

00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:55.510
Now, this application can be accessed from the bottom of every page on

00:47:55.510 --> 00:48:00.510
jw.org under the heading get help for.

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:05.510
And it's going to be available Monday October 6, 2014.

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:10.510
And we are also told that it will be available from the various app

00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:14.510
providers also on Monday morning.

00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:19.510
So, look forward to downloading this wonderful new tool just in a couple of days.

00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:21.510
Well, I'm sure you agree.

00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:25.510
We are going to have many reasons to thank Jehovah by the end of this day.

00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:28.510
But I have to tell you that's not the end.

00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:35.659
We have yet another exciting initiative to tell you about.

00:48:35.659 --> 00:48:39.659
The governing body is pleased to announce today, now get ready for it,

00:48:39.659 --> 00:48:49.349
an English television station that can be accessed via Internet.

00:48:49.349 --> 00:48:53.349
It is called JW Broadcasting.

00:48:53.349 --> 00:48:58.349
Now, in addition to being able to view our videos on demand,

00:48:58.349 --> 00:49:03.349
every month there will be an encouraging one-hour program

00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:27.860
that will be hosted by a member of the governing body.

00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:30.860
So, now I know you're very curious to see what this is all about.

00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:34.860
So, please watch the following short video that will explain this feature

00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:36.860
in a little bit more detail.

00:49:36.860 --> 00:51:06.820
Getting the feeling that you like it.

00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:09.820
Well, now, we were going to leave it at that.

00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:15.820
But we thought that perhaps you might like to see the opening of the first

00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:19.820
program that's going to be played during the month of October.

00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:26.710
Would you like to see that?

00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:30.710
So, please give your attention now as we play the first seven minutes

00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:35.710
of the first program that will appear on JW Broadcasting.

00:51:35.710 --> 00:51:44.219
We warmly welcome you dear brothers and sisters

00:51:44.219 --> 00:51:49.219
for our first JW Broadcasting monthly program.

00:51:49.219 --> 00:51:53.219
Here are some of the highlights you can look forward to.

00:51:53.219 --> 00:51:57.219
You will hear the exciting story of a brother

00:51:57.219 --> 00:52:02.219
who found the truth at the age of 87.

00:52:02.219 --> 00:52:07.219
We also have an archive interview with brother Theodore Jarrah's

00:52:07.219 --> 00:52:10.219
about how we can overcome opposition.

00:52:10.219 --> 00:52:16.219
And you will see a music video about wildlife as a Christian

00:52:16.219 --> 00:52:39.150
is the best life ever.

00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:44.150
The governing body has approved this station on a trial basis initially

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:50.150
in the English language only, based on the response from viewers.

00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:53.150
And your support of this new arrangement,

00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:58.150
it is hoped that other languages will enjoy the same in the future.

00:52:58.150 --> 00:53:03.150
In addition to having our videos available on demand,

00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:11.150
JW Broadcasting will feature an encouraging monthly program hosted

00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:14.150
by member of the governing body.

00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:16.150
This month on behalf of the governing body,

00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:21.150
I would like to address the young ones in our congregations.

00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:23.150
But before we do so,

00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:27.150
we thought you would like to see the behind the scenes work

00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:31.150
that went into creating this beautiful studio.

00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:35.150
Please watch this short explanatory video.

00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:44.860
It is evident that JW Broadcasting has Jehovah's Blessing.

00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:51.579
Those involved in preparing the studio, the equipment,

00:53:51.579 --> 00:53:59.440
and the content all said that they could feel Jehovah's hand directing every step,

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:02.440
every decision, every day.

00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:08.440
Upon learning of its intended purpose, many long days went into planning its design

00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:13.440
and what it would take to construct it and have it ready as soon as possible.

00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:18.440
Research that usually takes months was completed in days.

00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:22.440
The purchasing department ordered hundreds of items in record time,

00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:27.440
starting of course with the items that required the most lead time.

00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:32.440
In the meantime, a scout team got busy searching for a suitable location

00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:37.440
and a good one was found in the office complex at 30 Columbia Heights.

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:40.440
Sensing Jehovah's direction on this endeavor,

00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:48.829
the brothers vacated the entire area in just one week.

00:54:48.829 --> 00:54:53.829
The maintenance departments then prepared the room for television production

00:54:53.829 --> 00:55:02.380
while the design team diligently worked on the look of the set.

00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:08.380
Color and lighting were key pieces in conveying a dignified yet modern feel.

00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:15.380
The approved design was then translated into an actual set by the construction team.

00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:33.920
Many brothers and sisters from around the U.S. were called into assist.

00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:45.739
After only a few days, the equipment started to arrive.

00:55:45.739 --> 00:55:48.739
Miles of cables were installed.

00:55:48.739 --> 00:55:57.030
And the technical team had to ensure that all of the pieces of hardware and software

00:55:57.030 --> 00:56:03.610
worked well together.

00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:20.760
Simultaneously, the orchestra was recording the theme music in our audio video studios at Patterson.

00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:25.760
Brothers and sisters from all over the world contributed with their skills.

00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:29.760
But a television studio is no good without content.

00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:33.760
Video productions were immediately started by the film crews.

00:56:33.760 --> 00:57:05.130
Scripts had to be prepared and reenactment scheduled.

00:57:05.130 --> 00:57:10.130
When the set was finished, the equipment installed and the videos completed.

00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:31.159
The team started rehearsing the program that you are now watching.

00:57:31.159 --> 00:57:38.159
We asked an industry professional how long it would normally take to complete a studio and project of this size.

00:57:38.159 --> 00:57:44.659
He said without hesitating at least a year and a half.

00:57:44.659 --> 00:57:52.659
Yet our hard working brothers and sisters accomplished this monumental task in just two months.

00:57:52.659 --> 00:58:00.659
This just emphasizes the fact that when Jehovah wants something done, there is nothing that can stop him.

00:58:00.659 --> 00:58:10.420
Some of the materials and all of the work on this studio were donated, which we very much appreciate.

00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:17.420
Still, as you can see, there was a significant outlay of funds to complete the project.

00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:24.420
Some of you may be wondering why we would embark on a project like this here in Brooklyn

00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:34.420
knowing full well that in a little over two years, Jehovah willing, we will be moving world headquarters to Warwick, New York.

00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:42.420
Number one, we wanted you brothers and sisters to benefit from this initiative as soon as possible.

00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:50.420
And two, everything acquired and purchased for this studio will be transferred to the Warwick area,

00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:55.420
except the paint on the walls and the paint on the floor.

00:58:55.420 --> 00:59:03.420
So really, it is an investment that we are hopeful with your support can be used on into the years ahead.

00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:49.980
Well, this new Internet television station will be available for access in two different ways.

00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:58.980
Access information will be found under the heading Get Help for at the bottom of every page of JW.org.

00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:04.980
But there is another way. You can use the specific website address for this feature.

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:12.980
The website address is tv.jw.org.

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:38.570
Now, the October program and the video on Demand feature will be available on Monday, October 6, 2014.

01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:44.570
It really is thrilling when we consider how Jehovah is making use of technology.

01:00:44.570 --> 01:00:52.570
In order to move ahead, spearhead the preaching work and also to strengthen the faith of our dear brothers and sisters all around the earth.

01:00:52.570 --> 01:00:56.570
We certainly thank Jehovah for these wonderful tools.

01:00:56.570 --> 01:01:03.570
Well, now today, since we are observing the 100th anniversary of Kingdom Rule,

01:01:03.570 --> 01:01:12.570
it is important that we take a few moments and look back and think about all of the different accomplishments of God's Kingdom.

01:01:12.570 --> 01:01:22.570
And so, I think you're going to be delighted now to see a video that's entitled The Kingdom 100 Years and Counting.

01:01:22.570 --> 01:01:27.570
And this will be narrated by our dear brother Samuel Heard of the governing body.

01:01:27.570 --> 01:02:16.800
One of us are well and happy.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:22.800
Every day, we're still working away. And we feel as brother Russell has said,

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:27.800
the Gentile times have ended and their kings have had their day.

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:31.800
So we know not what awaits us.

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:42.800
May you, day by day, keep close to the master and his presence will so cheer you that nothing shall be able to dismay you.

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:48.800
Edith Kessler, October 11, 1914.

01:02:48.800 --> 01:03:11.860
At the Keenan's birth in 1914, the Bible students were not exactly sure what was going to happen,

01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:14.860
but they knew it would be a pivotal year.

01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:20.860
For decades, they had been seeing that the Gentile times were closing and that the kings had had their day.

01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:26.860
And they had been using every means available to focus attention on this monumental event.

01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:34.860
Newspapers had carried sermons to millions. Volunteer workers had distributed millions of free tracks.

01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:40.860
Coal porters were zealously preaching pilgrims were busy organizing congregations.

01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:43.860
And a message was expanding globally.

01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:47.860
But with the end of the Gentile times approaching so quickly,

01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:51.860
how could so few Bible students reach an entire world?

01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:53.860
How could they quicken the pace?

01:03:53.860 --> 01:04:08.440
It is unanimously resolved to use moving pictures and teaching Bible truths.

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:15.440
The Lord sanctioned this in His use of word pictures so this should not be neglected.

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:19.440
The Watchtower, July 1, 1913.

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:26.440
With that resolution, the Bible students were galvanized to present the photo drama of creation.

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:31.440
But such a mammoth undertaking would not come without challenges.

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:38.440
Some of the young brothers learned to operate the projection machine by volunteering at the local theaters.

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:42.440
Being too young, I used to sit in the booth with the brother.

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:46.440
I can remember how exciting it was when a film caught fire.

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:51.440
How the brother had to act quickly to put it out and proceed with the performance.

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:54.849
Dwight Kenyon.

01:04:54.849 --> 01:04:57.849
It was excellent. It was very amazing.

01:04:57.849 --> 01:05:05.849
You had individual back in those days that were able to do that without modern instrument and it was very impressive.

01:05:05.849 --> 01:05:08.849
That's really what helped my father to come into the truth.

01:05:08.849 --> 01:05:15.849
They got to the meeting the next day after it was finished and eventually started studying and within a few months they were baptized.

01:05:15.849 --> 01:05:21.849
And my mom told me that she was one of the usherettes when they put on the photo drama there in their town in Texas.

01:05:21.849 --> 01:05:27.849
But they had little pictures, postcard size of the pictures that were used, the slides.

01:05:27.849 --> 01:05:32.849
And it was a joy to look at those from time to time when I was a kid.

01:05:32.849 --> 01:05:36.849
Nine million people saw the photo drama during his first year.

01:05:36.849 --> 01:05:41.849
A precious message they would not soon forget.

01:05:41.849 --> 01:05:44.849
And there was more to come.

01:05:44.849 --> 01:05:48.849
From every part of the field has come the cry saying,

01:05:48.849 --> 01:05:51.849
what more is there that we can do?

01:05:51.849 --> 01:05:57.849
The result is a new magazine under the title, The Golden Age.

01:05:57.849 --> 01:06:00.849
Joseph F. Rutherford.

01:06:00.849 --> 01:06:03.849
After that announcement, brother Rutherford asked of everyone there,

01:06:03.849 --> 01:06:06.849
how many desire to do this work?

01:06:06.849 --> 01:06:10.849
Six thousand Bible students stood up as one.

01:06:10.849 --> 01:06:18.469
And over the next decade, the thousands who would participate in that harvest work

01:06:18.469 --> 01:06:23.469
would use many creative methods to reach more people faster.

01:06:23.469 --> 01:06:27.469
Among them was a book, The Heart of God.

01:06:27.469 --> 01:06:31.469
People were encouraged to get the harp study course by mail.

01:06:31.469 --> 01:06:34.469
Then, when I went to the home of our service director,

01:06:34.469 --> 01:06:38.469
his wife and I ran speed races typing addresses on these cards.

01:06:38.469 --> 01:06:41.469
We sent out hundreds each week.

01:06:41.469 --> 01:06:43.469
Trudeau McKittrick.

01:06:43.469 --> 01:06:46.469
Soon another technique would come to the fore.

01:06:46.469 --> 01:06:49.469
The radio station WBBR.

01:06:49.469 --> 01:06:54.469
The studio for this new radio broadcasting station was located in the attic.

01:06:54.469 --> 01:06:59.469
The microphone that we used at the beginning was taken from an ordinary telephone.

01:06:59.469 --> 01:07:04.469
Finally, after some weeks of preparations, we were ready for the first broadcast.

01:07:04.469 --> 01:07:09.469
That occurred on Sunday evening, February 24th, 1924.

01:07:09.469 --> 01:07:13.469
The call letters were WBBR.

01:07:13.469 --> 01:07:18.469
These call letters, our enemies, said, met wicked buzzes by radio.

01:07:18.469 --> 01:07:23.469
It was my privilege to throw the power switch on for that first broadcast

01:07:23.469 --> 01:07:26.469
and a way we went, hoping for the best.

01:07:26.469 --> 01:07:28.469
Ralph Leffler.

01:07:28.469 --> 01:07:31.469
The peoples of this earth are now numbered with a thousand of millions.

01:07:31.469 --> 01:07:35.469
WBBR, in many respects, was a forerunner to the videos.

01:07:36.469 --> 01:07:39.469
Because we had Bible questions answered there.

01:07:39.469 --> 01:07:42.469
We had public meetings. We had book studies.

01:07:42.469 --> 01:07:44.469
We had news.

01:07:44.469 --> 01:07:47.469
The first piece of equipment that someone got when they came into the truth

01:07:47.469 --> 01:07:49.469
was a really good radio.

01:07:49.469 --> 01:07:51.469
So they could hear WBBR.

01:07:51.469 --> 01:07:56.469
And that's like I mentioned earlier how my parents first heard the truth.

01:07:56.469 --> 01:08:00.469
Was a radio discourse that a brother gave a talk on where they did.

01:08:00.469 --> 01:08:04.469
I had the privilege of times of giving talks on the WBBR.

01:08:04.469 --> 01:08:08.469
A young minister speaks. I gave that once or twice.

01:08:08.469 --> 01:08:13.469
I was encouraged to take part in one of their Bible study groups.

01:08:13.469 --> 01:08:16.470
I was privileged to be on it.

01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:24.470
It was a program that was designed as a family Bible study.

01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:30.470
But even before that, quite a number of years ago,

01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:35.470
Fred Franz was on WBBR.

01:08:35.470 --> 01:08:41.470
Imagine him on the air and youngsters listening to him.

01:08:41.470 --> 01:08:44.470
Good evening, boys and girls.

01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:50.470
I know it's drawing close to bedtime for many of you.

01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:57.470
But before you take yourselves to bed, I want to tell you a story.

01:08:57.470 --> 01:09:01.470
I had never imagined I'd ever be on a radio program of any kind.

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:05.470
And here I was presenting the truth as a part of a program.

01:09:05.470 --> 01:09:09.470
So it was a real joy to be on WBBR.

01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:13.470
The success of WBBR was met with increased opposition.

01:09:13.470 --> 01:09:17.470
So other methods were used to keep spreading the kingdom message.

01:09:17.470 --> 01:09:23.470
When I was little, we never had an automobile in our home.

01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:28.470
But these sound cars, big, beautiful cars.

01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:31.470
But these big horns on top.

01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:35.470
And when they broadcasted first music, everybody came out to listen.

01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:40.470
And every weekend, some of the, what we were called today,

01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:46.470
elders would bring the sound car in and station it in our yard.

01:09:46.470 --> 01:09:50.470
And from there, they would play the records for the neighborhood.

01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:53.470
Every weekend, we had a large group of people listening

01:09:53.470 --> 01:09:56.470
because of their location they could stay and listen.

01:09:56.470 --> 01:10:01.470
And there was quite a gathering during that time.

01:10:01.470 --> 01:10:04.470
Another time I set up and started one of Brother Rutherford's lectures

01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:07.470
telling about the second coming of Christ.

01:10:07.470 --> 01:10:11.470
A few days afterward, a person told me that his fellow moonshiner

01:10:11.470 --> 01:10:14.470
was set up in the woods making a run of moonshine.

01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:18.470
When all of a sudden, here came a voice from above.

01:10:19.470 --> 01:10:25.039
He got excited and went to run it.

01:10:29.039 --> 01:10:33.510
But he could not get away from the sound.

01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:39.510
He finally ran home to get his axe and went back up there

01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:42.510
and chopped up his still.

01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:45.510
He said he did not want the Lord to catch him making moonshine

01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:47.510
at his coming.

01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:58.060
See him personally.

01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:01.060
We would come up on a porch, open our case,

01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:04.060
set the arm and position on the record,

01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:06.060
and push the doorbell.

01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:09.060
When the householder opened the door, we would say,

01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:12.060
I have an important message I would like you to hear,

01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:14.060
and we would start the record.

01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:17.060
It is often said that he would...

01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:21.060
When I was pioneering, I used a phonograph all the time.

01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:23.060
I liked the phonograph.

01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:26.060
This is an upright phonograph.

01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:31.060
We had the type that opened up and you could balance it on your hip

01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:35.060
if you were strong enough or you set it down on the porch

01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:39.060
and the message would be heard way down the street.

01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:44.060
And I always enjoyed hearing when I put the record on

01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:47.060
Brother Rutherford saying,

01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:51.060
religion is a snare and a racket.

01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:54.060
And I'd look at the expression on the face of the people,

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:57.060
whether they were happy or not.

01:11:57.060 --> 01:11:59.060
And I remember they told us,

01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:03.060
now, to help the householder concentrate on the message,

01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:05.060
it would be good if you would watch the record.

01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:09.060
So we were told to watch the record go round and round and round.

01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:11.060
Of course, we would get a little bit dizzy.

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:14.060
Many times you would knock on the door and set it up

01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:16.060
to the doorstep center.

01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:18.060
The party didn't even know what was going on.

01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:20.060
You started playing the record.

01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:22.060
The only thing he has with a phonograph,

01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:25.060
you always had to make sure you had the right record on.

01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:28.060
Sometimes you would use that phonograph at home

01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:31.060
and you'd play some hillbilly records.

01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:34.060
I took mom's phonograph

01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:39.060
and I put on my fast-water playing

01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:42.060
Boogie Wiggy in the St. Louis Blues.

01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:44.060
And so if you got out in service

01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:48.060
and you happen to have a record that was still on there.

01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:50.060
So she goes out in the service with a phonograph.

01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:53.060
It's up to let I have an important message.

01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:57.060
And here's fast-water playing Boogie Wiggy.

01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:02.060
Some witnesses even nicknamed the phonograph Aaron

01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:05.060
because it did the talking for us.

01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:09.060
But that wasn't the only method that was used.

01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:12.060
We also used a testimony card.

01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:15.060
This little card would have a nice little presentation on.

01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:18.060
It was scripture two and you'd show that the householder.

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:20.060
And usually they'd only read a few lines

01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:22.060
and then they'd hand it back to you

01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:24.060
so you'd have to finish the conversation.

01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:27.060
You'd give it to them to read and then it turned it over.

01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:30.060
So sometimes we had to start giving it to them on the wrong side

01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:33.060
so they would turn it to read it on the right side.

01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:35.060
So funny.

01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:37.060
I could just tell him why I'm there.

01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:38.060
So what I did.

01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:40.060
And to me it was a little easier.

01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:43.060
Some people were a little short on funds

01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:45.060
and so we would offer to trade.

01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:48.060
So many times out in the country

01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:50.060
they would trade you for maybe a dozen eggs

01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:53.060
for three or four booklets or something like that.

01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:56.060
Or if it was a book you might end up with a chicken or two.

01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:59.060
So when you went out and field service in the country

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:03.060
you had to be prepared to pick up many different things.

01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:05.060
Usually probably bagged the chicken up

01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:07.060
so he was in a bag back in the trunk.

01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:09.060
Got a little warm for the poor thing

01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:12.060
but they survived it and bring him home.

01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:15.060
And then after we got the chicken out

01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:16.060
and let him recover

01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:18.060
why we'd have a nice chicken dinner.

01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:23.779
So back in those days we ate a lot of chicken.

01:14:23.779 --> 01:14:24.779
In addition,

01:14:24.779 --> 01:14:26.779
plackers and information marches

01:14:26.779 --> 01:14:32.170
had also come on the scene.

01:14:32.170 --> 01:14:36.170
And brother Rutherford of course was a shorthand expert.

01:14:36.170 --> 01:14:38.170
And whenever you talk to him

01:14:38.170 --> 01:14:41.170
he'd always be busy writing.

01:14:41.170 --> 01:14:43.170
He wouldn't know what he'd be writing about.

01:14:43.170 --> 01:14:45.170
So he's doing that this day.

01:14:45.170 --> 01:14:47.170
He ripped it off and he gave it to me.

01:14:47.170 --> 01:14:49.170
He said, what do you think of it?

01:14:49.170 --> 01:14:52.170
And it said religions are staring their racket.

01:14:52.170 --> 01:14:54.170
So I said, my,

01:14:54.170 --> 01:14:56.170
that's pretty strong.

01:14:56.170 --> 01:14:58.170
As a matter of fact I said, that's hot.

01:15:00.170 --> 01:15:02.170
Well, he said, that's what I meant it to be.

01:15:02.170 --> 01:15:05.170
So now he said, don't you think it's a good idea?

01:15:05.170 --> 01:15:07.170
Now we're going to have a big information march

01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:09.170
two days from now.

01:15:09.170 --> 01:15:10.170
Couldn't brother play in the printing,

01:15:10.170 --> 01:15:12.170
make up some signs, religions are staring their racket.

01:15:12.170 --> 01:15:16.170
Put them on poles and we'll have them for the parade.

01:15:16.170 --> 01:15:19.170
And brother Nora was also in London at that time.

01:15:19.170 --> 01:15:21.170
So he and I led this parade.

01:15:21.170 --> 01:15:22.170
This parade was six miles long.

01:15:22.170 --> 01:15:24.170
A thousand brothers showed up for the parade.

01:15:24.170 --> 01:15:26.170
It really was a spectacle.

01:15:26.170 --> 01:15:29.170
Every second sign would be religion is staring their racket.

01:15:29.170 --> 01:15:33.170
And the Bobby's, the police gave us protection

01:15:33.170 --> 01:15:38.170
as we went down to Piccadilly Circus, Oxford Street,

01:15:38.170 --> 01:15:40.170
right in the center of London.

01:15:41.170 --> 01:15:44.170
We'd put on these sandwich signs, you know,

01:15:44.170 --> 01:15:48.170
that had some kind of a message and slogans on it.

01:15:48.170 --> 01:15:52.170
And they'd give us a little sign that we carried, you know, on a stick.

01:15:52.170 --> 01:15:55.170
We had, religion is a snare in the racket.

01:15:55.170 --> 01:15:57.170
Then you had to put on the other side.

01:15:57.170 --> 01:15:59.170
And he said, boy, that's pretty strong.

01:15:59.170 --> 01:16:02.170
And on the other side, it's so God and Christ the King.

01:16:02.170 --> 01:16:06.170
And we walked very slowly down the street

01:16:06.170 --> 01:16:09.170
and then back the other way in an area.

01:16:09.170 --> 01:16:12.170
And we would approach people with a hand-bill

01:16:12.170 --> 01:16:15.170
and everybody took them and they were looking at the placard.

01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:18.170
They would try to not let you think they were looking at you,

01:16:18.170 --> 01:16:22.170
but they were, they were reading all of the information on the placard.

01:16:22.170 --> 01:16:26.170
Some people would say something to the effect

01:16:26.170 --> 01:16:28.170
that you're doing a good work.

01:16:28.170 --> 01:16:30.170
And that was always a blessing to me.

01:16:30.170 --> 01:16:34.170
I know I should remember the sister who looked up at the sign

01:16:34.170 --> 01:16:35.170
that she was carrying.

01:16:35.170 --> 01:16:37.170
She looked back up over her head.

01:16:37.170 --> 01:16:39.170
She said, serve God and Christ the King.

01:16:39.170 --> 01:16:41.170
And she looked at the one in front of her.

01:16:41.170 --> 01:16:45.170
And the back of that sign said, religion is a snare in the racket.

01:16:45.170 --> 01:16:48.170
She said, well, I'm sure glad I don't have to carry that sign.

01:16:48.170 --> 01:16:50.170
Well, she was carrying that sign.

01:16:50.170 --> 01:16:52.170
It was in the back of her.

01:16:52.170 --> 01:16:55.170
But in a way, she didn't know us, so she was happy.

01:16:55.170 --> 01:16:59.170
They had adult-sized placards and they had little fellow placards.

01:16:59.170 --> 01:17:02.170
Well, I was only about four feet tall.

01:17:02.170 --> 01:17:05.170
But whenever I got dirty, the little ones were gone.

01:17:05.170 --> 01:17:07.170
So I only got a big one.

01:17:07.170 --> 01:17:08.170
It came underneath here.

01:17:08.170 --> 01:17:10.170
And every time I took a step, I kicked it with my feet.

01:17:10.170 --> 01:17:12.170
But it didn't make any difference.

01:17:12.170 --> 01:17:16.170
We enjoyed working with placards.

01:17:16.170 --> 01:17:22.550
Nobody ever trained me in the ministry.

01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:27.550
So one day I was at the meeting and the brother passed out.

01:17:27.550 --> 01:17:29.550
The publisher's cards.

01:17:29.550 --> 01:17:30.550
And I said, where's mine?

01:17:30.550 --> 01:17:31.550
He said, well, you don't get one.

01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:32.550
You're not a publisher.

01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:33.550
And I said, well, what's that?

01:17:33.550 --> 01:17:34.550
And he said, you got to go preaching.

01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:35.550
I said, how do you do that?

01:17:35.550 --> 01:17:37.550
He said, well, come on Saturday.

01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:39.550
And go over there and get magazines.

01:17:39.550 --> 01:17:42.550
And then I went out and they pointed me out a door.

01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:44.550
I was scared, but I just went anyway.

01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:46.550
I didn't care.

01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:49.550
My first experience in field service was really cute.

01:17:49.550 --> 01:17:52.550
I knocked on the door and they said, hello.

01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:54.550
I've got something for you.

01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:57.550
And you can have it for a penny.

01:17:57.550 --> 01:18:00.550
Or you can have it free if you promise to read it.

01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:03.550
I placed one in every door.

01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:06.550
One morning I was taking a group out in the field ministry.

01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:10.550
And a Navy man shows up at the Kingdom Hall.

01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:12.550
He's got his uniform on.

01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:14.550
And I didn't know what to do.

01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:16.550
So I took him door to door with me.

01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:17.550
And it was really very interesting.

01:18:17.550 --> 01:18:19.550
I thought it was pretty neat me going to door to door

01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:21.550
with the guy in the military standing next to me.

01:18:21.550 --> 01:18:23.550
And I'm given my presentations.

01:18:23.550 --> 01:18:24.550
And he's got a Bible.

01:18:24.550 --> 01:18:25.550
We're following along with me.

01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:27.550
Of course, later on, I learned really

01:18:27.550 --> 01:18:29.550
it's not the most appropriate thing to take

01:18:29.550 --> 01:18:31.550
someone in military uniform on the ministry with you.

01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:33.550
But at that time, I did it.

01:18:33.550 --> 01:18:36.550
So my father and December said, well, he's going to go out in service.

01:18:36.550 --> 01:18:38.550
So I got ready and went with him.

01:18:38.550 --> 01:18:41.550
Now, neither one of us has ever been out in service before.

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:44.550
The presiding overseer handed my father a territory

01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:46.550
and sent the two of us out together.

01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:48.550
My father said, do you take that side?

01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:49.550
And I'll take this side.

01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:51.550
And that's what it was like.

01:18:51.550 --> 01:18:54.550
And of course, I was no more prepared than a man and a moon.

01:18:54.550 --> 01:18:58.550
We had pioneers come to our house and they studied with us.

01:18:58.550 --> 01:19:01.550
And she decided to get us started in the ministry.

01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:03.550
We would begin with street work.

01:19:03.550 --> 01:19:06.550
But I said, no, I said, I don't want to do that.

01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:09.550
And she said, well, that's too bad.

01:19:09.550 --> 01:19:13.550
She said, because I can see the book of life now.

01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:16.550
There's the names of your sisters written there.

01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:18.550
No more rain.

01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:20.550
As I got older, there was a pioneer brother

01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:23.550
and the congregation that asked if I'd like to go with him

01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:25.550
to work with him.

01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:28.550
He carried a rifle on the back of his car,

01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:30.550
which I thought was kind of unusual.

01:19:30.550 --> 01:19:32.550
So we'd see a rabbit.

01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:34.550
He'd stop the car and shoot the rabbit.

01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:36.550
Put it in the car.

01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:39.550
As it got toward the end of the day,

01:19:39.550 --> 01:19:41.550
we'd ask him, did they know of any place

01:19:41.550 --> 01:19:43.550
where we could stay overnight?

01:19:43.550 --> 01:19:46.550
Because we were out in the ministry.

01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:49.550
And the people and two different answers I recall.

01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:51.550
They said, well, you can stay with us.

01:19:51.550 --> 01:19:54.550
One of them said, well, we don't have enough food for supper.

01:19:54.550 --> 01:19:57.550
And the brother said, well, I have a couple of rabbits here,

01:19:57.550 --> 01:19:59.550
if you want to scan them.

01:19:59.550 --> 01:20:02.550
I don't think that this would work now.

01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:07.960
And carrying a rifle on the car certainly is not advice.

01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:10.960
It gradually became clear that the individual minister

01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:12.960
needed further cultivation.

01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:15.960
So the brother started perhaps the only school

01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:19.960
from which not one single solitary person

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:21.960
has ever graduated.

01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:24.960
The Theocratic ministry school.

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:28.960
I recall the time I gave my first six-minute talk.

01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:31.960
I was not confident in myself, so I wrote it down.

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:33.960
But when I got up to give it,

01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:35.960
audience fear gripped me and I started,

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:38.960
then it mattered, losing my thoughts.

01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:40.960
Then I resorted to reading from the manuscript.

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:42.960
But my hands were trembling so much

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:45.960
that the lines were jumping up and down.

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:47.960
George Ganges.

01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:49.960
Well, I remember when the ministry school thought of it,

01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:51.960
you know, and I remember the brother he gave

01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:54.960
a first talk and he was so nervous he was kicking the podium

01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:55.960
all the time.

01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:56.960
Boom, boom, boom.

01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:57.960
I didn't know he was doing it.

01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:01.960
I was sure as my heart could be heard for the first four rows,

01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:03.960
because it was beating so hard.

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.960
Back then, the sisters didn't give talks.

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:07.960
The brothers gave the talks.

01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:10.960
The sisters didn't we just laughed and giggled at the brothers.

01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:14.960
You know, we were all very, very excited as sisters

01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:17.960
when we were invited to be part of the school.

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:19.960
And I remember we were just, I was just so excited.

01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:20.960
I jumped up and was clapping.

01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:22.960
The sisters behind me were crying.

01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:23.960
I have to give talks now.

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:25.960
Oh, they didn't like it.

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:27.960
I couldn't figure out why they were crying.

01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:30.960
But we were in West Virginia in a little tiny congregation.

01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:33.960
And guess who it was to give the first talk?

01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:35.960
It was me, of course.

01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:37.960
So I was scared to death.

01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:39.960
But we did it.

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:42.960
I think everybody was quite nervous and apprehensive

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:43.960
in the very beginning.

01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:46.960
So it's really quite a marvelous training program.

01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:49.960
It's besides just not just public speaking.

01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:52.960
It's training in life.

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:55.960
This school would prove invaluable in training God's people

01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:59.960
to use their gift to speech and proclaiming the Kingdom Good News.

01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:01.960
But at the same time, another school

01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:05.960
was also having a powerful effect on the ministry.

01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:09.960
They watched our Bible College of Gilead.

01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:14.960
That was five and a half months of some of the happiest in my life.

01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:19.960
It seemed like everybody else was a mental theocratic giant.

01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:21.960
So we were intimidated.

01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:23.960
I guess I should speak for myself mainly.

01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:25.960
I felt intimidated there.

01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:28.960
And I thought that everybody else probably knew a lot more than I did.

01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:29.960
The classes were a delight.

01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:31.960
Our instructors were brothers Schroeder,

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:36.960
brother Maxwell Friend, Jack Redford, and Bob Porter.

01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:38.960
Well, I'll tell you a story from brother friend.

01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:41.960
After I gave one of my talks in Gilead,

01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:46.960
he said to me, Sister Brooks, I admire your grandchildren.

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:50.960
He said, you will be able to tell them such wonderful bedtime stories.

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:57.960
He said, brothers, Hebrews 412 says God's word is alive.

01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:01.960
He said, don't kill it by the way you read it.

01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:05.960
I think one thing was the little white house

01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:09.960
and the kingdom in our preaching classes with brother Redford.

01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:11.960
I'm telling you that little white house

01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:14.960
that had a doorbell and a door.

01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:18.960
And you would get sent out on the class of a decide,

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:20.960
what objection you were going to get.

01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:23.960
You come back in, I'm telling you to push that doorbell,

01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:27.960
not knowing what was going to happen behind that door

01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:29.960
and to see how you handled it.

01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:33.960
It was real, real, real, formation, believe me.

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:38.960
It prepared us really for the ministry and what was ahead of us.

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:41.960
It was wonderful training for the ministry.

01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:43.960
I loved it.

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:46.960
The next several decades would see more new schools

01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:49.960
and training programs.

01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:52.960
But it would also witness monumental conventions

01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:55.960
and groundbreaking new releases.

01:23:55.960 --> 01:24:07.260
More tools to help God's people stay focused on the heartless.

01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:10.260
1950, I don't think there's ever been a convention

01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:14.260
that had that kind of almost electricity in the air.

01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:16.260
Everybody is excited.

01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:19.260
They're looking forward to the public talk

01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:21.260
and the releases.

01:24:21.260 --> 01:24:23.260
Everybody wants to get the new publications.

01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:26.260
It was eight days that convention.

01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:31.260
I'm not sure that people could endure that much these days.

01:24:31.260 --> 01:24:34.260
Well, I was so happy that we were having the convention

01:24:34.260 --> 01:24:38.260
because the people used to think we were just some little

01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:40.260
dinky religion, you know.

01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:42.260
And I knew when thearchy stayed,

01:24:42.260 --> 01:24:44.260
it was going to straighten them out.

01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:48.260
But when that new world translation in Greek scriptures

01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:51.260
was released, it really brought the house down.

01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:54.260
Everybody expressed themselves.

01:24:54.260 --> 01:24:58.260
And they clapped and they was cheering and clapping.

01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:03.260
And everybody needed to sit until after the session

01:25:03.260 --> 01:25:05.260
before they got their new books.

01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:07.260
To have the new world translation,

01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:10.260
even though it was the Green Bible,

01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:14.260
was just such a wonderful tool for us in the ministry.

01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:17.260
It was exciting then just like it is now.

01:25:17.260 --> 01:25:18.260
Every time you get something new,

01:25:18.260 --> 01:25:20.260
and of course you appreciate it more as you use it.

01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:22.260
Another thing I loved about those conventions,

01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:24.260
they had a live orchestra.

01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:28.260
And singing with a live orchestra was already exciting.

01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:30.260
But boy, when you would sit in those stadiums

01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:32.260
and see all your brothers and sisters,

01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:35.260
it just was so heartwarming and made me feel safe

01:25:35.260 --> 01:25:37.260
inside Jehovah's organization.

01:25:37.260 --> 01:25:39.260
And it was just wonderful.

01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:40.260
Every time you went to the convention,

01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:42.260
it was something thrilling.

01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:46.260
And when it ended, we didn't want it to end.

01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:49.260
This period of expanded activity would result in publishers,

01:25:49.260 --> 01:25:51.260
pioneers, Bible studies,

01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:53.260
return visits, placements,

01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:57.260
and all aspects of the ministry reaching record eyes.

01:25:57.260 --> 01:25:59.260
The work was growing in more countries than ever.

01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:02.260
But most importantly, the good news of the kingdom

01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:04.260
was being preached.

01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:06.260
But as has often been the case,

01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:08.260
there was much more to come.

01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:11.260
Just think of some of the events that you have witnessed

01:26:11.260 --> 01:26:14.260
in recent decades.

01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:16.260
The Pioneer Service School,

01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:18.260
the Ministerial Training School,

01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:21.260
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers,

01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:24.260
Special Metropolitan Public Witnessing,

01:26:24.260 --> 01:26:27.260
a newly designed JW.org,

01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:32.260
Caleb, and the Become Jehovah's Friend Series,

01:26:32.260 --> 01:26:36.859
the revised New World Translation.

01:26:36.859 --> 01:26:39.859
And now, a new language app to further train publishers

01:26:39.859 --> 01:26:44.859
to learn to speak the pure language in multiple languages.

01:26:44.859 --> 01:26:46.859
Video on Demand,

01:26:46.859 --> 01:26:49.859
an entirely new website,

01:26:49.859 --> 01:26:51.859
where people can watch morning worship

01:26:51.859 --> 01:26:54.859
and other video publications.

01:26:54.859 --> 01:26:57.859
And finally, a return to Broadcasting,

01:26:57.859 --> 01:26:59.859
our own TV station,

01:26:59.859 --> 01:27:02.859
JW Broadcasting,

01:27:02.859 --> 01:27:05.859
taking the Bible's message from world headquarters

01:27:05.859 --> 01:27:09.859
to the farthest reaches of the planet.

01:27:09.859 --> 01:27:11.859
Imagine what we will look back on

01:27:11.859 --> 01:27:14.859
to the one thousandth or one millionth anniversary

01:27:14.859 --> 01:27:16.859
of Kingdom Rule.

01:27:16.859 --> 01:27:18.859
The past one or two years helps us to appreciate

01:27:18.859 --> 01:27:20.859
that God's kingdom is real

01:27:20.859 --> 01:27:23.859
and that Jehovah God has been using that kingdom

01:27:23.859 --> 01:27:26.859
to accomplish His will on earth today.

01:27:26.859 --> 01:27:29.859
But how real is that kingdom to you?

01:27:29.859 --> 01:27:31.859
Looking back on our heritage,

01:27:31.859 --> 01:27:33.859
and speaking to those with years of experience,

01:27:33.859 --> 01:27:35.859
will make the kingdom more real to you

01:27:35.859 --> 01:27:39.859
and will prepare you to benefit from that kingdom.

01:27:39.859 --> 01:27:41.859
The governing body

01:27:41.859 --> 01:27:44.859
have been anxious to give whatever they can

01:27:44.859 --> 01:27:46.859
for the building of the brothers

01:27:46.859 --> 01:27:49.859
and teaching them to walk the upright world.

01:27:49.859 --> 01:27:53.859
Oh, I think the revised New World translation is a marvel.

01:27:53.859 --> 01:27:55.859
The word love isn't big enough to say

01:27:55.859 --> 01:27:57.859
how much I love that Bible.

01:27:57.859 --> 01:27:59.859
J.W. Orange is fantastic.

01:27:59.859 --> 01:28:01.859
I'm in my iPad all the time.

01:28:01.859 --> 01:28:03.859
And then, using videos,

01:28:03.859 --> 01:28:05.859
I'm in love with Caleb.

01:28:05.859 --> 01:28:07.859
He's keeping abreast with what we need

01:28:07.859 --> 01:28:09.859
to be efficient ministers

01:28:09.859 --> 01:28:11.859
and to fulfill our responsibilities.

01:28:11.859 --> 01:28:13.859
Everything at the society has done.

01:28:13.859 --> 01:28:15.859
It's been parrard to it.

01:28:15.859 --> 01:28:17.859
We're growing faster today

01:28:17.859 --> 01:28:19.859
than we ever have.

01:28:19.859 --> 01:28:22.859
Jehovah really moving the chariot

01:28:22.859 --> 01:28:24.859
and we're trying to keep up with it.

01:28:24.859 --> 01:28:26.859
And I've been very grateful

01:28:26.859 --> 01:28:28.859
for having Jesus' brothers

01:28:28.859 --> 01:28:29.859
to take the lead for us.

01:28:29.859 --> 01:28:31.859
There is no question

01:28:31.859 --> 01:28:34.859
about the kingdom being in control.

01:28:34.859 --> 01:28:36.859
What else can be more real than the kingdom?

01:28:36.859 --> 01:28:38.859
And the hope at all.

01:28:38.859 --> 01:28:40.859
I just feel privileged

01:28:40.859 --> 01:28:42.859
to have some share

01:28:42.859 --> 01:28:44.859
in inviting others

01:28:44.859 --> 01:28:47.859
to join us as servants of Jehovah God.

01:28:47.859 --> 01:28:49.859
If the sun comes up,

01:28:49.859 --> 01:28:52.859
we know that the kingdom is going to accomplish

01:28:52.859 --> 01:28:54.859
just what the Bible says that it is.

01:28:54.859 --> 01:28:56.859
This is the reality.

01:28:56.859 --> 01:28:57.859
God's kingdom.

01:28:57.859 --> 01:28:59.859
Everything else is an illusion.

01:28:59.859 --> 01:29:01.859
The kingdom is in control.

01:29:01.859 --> 01:29:04.859
We only have good things to look forward to.

01:29:04.859 --> 01:29:44.979
Now that was truly heartwarming.

01:29:44.979 --> 01:29:46.979
And I think it gives us an opportunity

01:29:46.979 --> 01:29:48.979
to think about just how much we love

01:29:48.979 --> 01:29:50.979
and respect all of the ones

01:29:50.979 --> 01:29:52.979
who went before us

01:29:52.979 --> 01:29:54.979
who gave their whole lives

01:29:54.979 --> 01:29:55.979
to the preaching work

01:29:55.979 --> 01:29:57.979
into advancing kingdom interests.

01:29:57.979 --> 01:30:00.979
How appropriate that we remember them today.

01:30:00.979 --> 01:30:02.979
Well now,

01:30:02.979 --> 01:30:04.979
another important aspect

01:30:04.979 --> 01:30:05.979
of our worship

01:30:05.979 --> 01:30:07.979
throughout these 100 years

01:30:07.979 --> 01:30:09.979
has been music.

01:30:09.979 --> 01:30:12.979
And how appropriate that we are giving attention

01:30:12.979 --> 01:30:13.979
to music here

01:30:13.979 --> 01:30:16.979
at this 100th anniversary annual meeting.

01:30:16.979 --> 01:30:18.979
So let's give our full attention now

01:30:18.979 --> 01:30:20.979
to further David's plane

01:30:20.979 --> 01:30:21.979
of the governing body

01:30:21.979 --> 01:30:23.979
and see what he has prepared for us.

01:30:23.979 --> 01:30:44.800
Well, I'm sure that there is no one in this audience

01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:46.800
who is not aware

01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:48.800
that last Monday evening,

01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:52.800
the Bethel family learned three new songs

01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:55.800
that we are going to sing today.

01:30:55.800 --> 01:30:59.800
They were outstanding.

01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:02.800
And it really made me think of

01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:05.800
something that we read in the book of Exodus,

01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:06.800
chapter 15.

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:08.800
Let's turn there.

01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:11.800
And let's see if you can pick out the connection

01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:14.800
between what happened last Monday evening

01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:18.800
and Exodus chapter 15 and verse 1.

01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:25.670
Exodus 15 and verse 1.

01:31:25.670 --> 01:31:28.670
It says, at that time,

01:31:28.670 --> 01:31:30.670
Moses and the Israelites

01:31:30.670 --> 01:31:33.670
sang this song to Jehovah.

01:31:33.670 --> 01:31:36.670
Let me sing to Jehovah

01:31:36.670 --> 01:31:39.670
for he has become highly exalted.

01:31:39.670 --> 01:31:42.670
The horse and its rider

01:31:42.670 --> 01:31:46.670
he has hurled into the sea.

01:31:46.670 --> 01:31:49.670
Now, there's no indication

01:31:49.670 --> 01:31:52.670
that Moses had advanced notice

01:31:52.670 --> 01:31:54.670
that Jehovah was going to drown

01:31:54.670 --> 01:31:57.670
the Egyptians in the Red Sea.

01:31:57.670 --> 01:32:00.670
It isn't as if three months before the event,

01:32:00.670 --> 01:32:02.670
Moses was able to hand out sheet music

01:32:02.670 --> 01:32:04.670
to all of the Israelites

01:32:04.670 --> 01:32:06.670
and said, here's a nice song.

01:32:06.670 --> 01:32:08.670
Why don't you practice it?

01:32:08.670 --> 01:32:09.670
And when the time comes,

01:32:09.670 --> 01:32:12.920
we'll all be able to sing it.

01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:14.920
They probably had to learn it

01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:18.920
and sing it right on the spot.

01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:20.920
And that's what happened last Monday night.

01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:22.920
And that, dear friends,

01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:25.920
is what's going to happen today.

01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:27.920
So what we're doing today

01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:30.920
is by no means unique.

01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:33.920
Now, of course, the question has arisen.

01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:36.920
I have been asked a number of times.

01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:37.920
What are we going to do

01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:39.920
with the three new songs

01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:42.920
after the annual meeting?

01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:45.920
Well, I have been evasive,

01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:52.119
but I can tell you now,

01:32:52.119 --> 01:32:54.119
those three new songs,

01:32:54.119 --> 01:32:58.119
along with about a dozen other new songs,

01:32:58.119 --> 01:33:00.119
are going to be incorporated

01:33:00.119 --> 01:33:04.119
into a revised songbook that is not ready yet.

01:33:04.119 --> 01:33:06.119
But when it is ready,

01:33:06.119 --> 01:33:09.119
it's going to look a lot like this.

01:33:09.119 --> 01:33:31.739
Guilt edges and all.

01:33:31.739 --> 01:33:33.739
When the printer office

01:33:33.739 --> 01:33:35.739
explained to the governing body

01:33:35.739 --> 01:33:37.739
what the cost difference would be

01:33:37.739 --> 01:33:39.739
between this lovely songbook

01:33:39.739 --> 01:33:41.739
and the one with the paper cover,

01:33:41.739 --> 01:33:43.739
the governing body said,

01:33:43.739 --> 01:33:45.739
thank you very much for the information

01:33:45.739 --> 01:33:48.739
we want the gray one.

01:33:48.739 --> 01:33:50.739
And this shows the value

01:33:50.739 --> 01:33:54.739
that the governing body places on our songs.

01:33:54.739 --> 01:33:55.739
But now you might ask,

01:33:55.739 --> 01:33:57.739
why was it necessary

01:33:57.739 --> 01:34:00.739
to revise the songbook?

01:34:00.739 --> 01:34:02.739
Three words.

01:34:02.739 --> 01:34:06.739
New World Translation.

01:34:06.739 --> 01:34:08.739
Many of the expressions

01:34:08.739 --> 01:34:10.739
that are in our current songbook

01:34:10.739 --> 01:34:12.739
are based on the earlier edition

01:34:12.739 --> 01:34:14.739
of the New World Translation.

01:34:14.739 --> 01:34:16.739
They've been revised.

01:34:16.739 --> 01:34:18.739
If you were listening carefully

01:34:18.739 --> 01:34:20.739
to the musical presentation

01:34:20.739 --> 01:34:22.739
before the session today,

01:34:22.739 --> 01:34:23.739
you probably noticed

01:34:23.739 --> 01:34:26.739
some word changes already.

01:34:26.739 --> 01:34:28.739
We don't say desirable things

01:34:28.739 --> 01:34:30.739
of all nations are joining us

01:34:30.739 --> 01:34:31.739
in all the earth,

01:34:31.739 --> 01:34:33.739
but those precious to God

01:34:33.739 --> 01:34:35.739
from all nations are joining us

01:34:35.739 --> 01:34:38.739
in all the earth.

01:34:38.739 --> 01:34:41.739
Loving kindness has been replaced

01:34:41.739 --> 01:34:43.739
by loyal love.

01:34:43.739 --> 01:34:45.739
That's a toughy for some Bethelites.

01:34:45.739 --> 01:34:47.739
I hear loving kindness quite a bit still.

01:34:47.739 --> 01:34:48.739
We'll get over it.

01:34:48.739 --> 01:34:50.739
And then finally,

01:34:50.739 --> 01:34:52.739
long suffering has been replaced

01:34:52.739 --> 01:34:54.739
by patience.

01:34:54.739 --> 01:34:56.739
And so because of the word changes,

01:34:56.739 --> 01:34:57.739
the governing body said,

01:34:57.739 --> 01:34:59.739
well, they're going to have to work on the lyrics,

01:34:59.739 --> 01:35:02.739
so why not add a few new songs

01:35:02.739 --> 01:35:05.739
so the brothers will be able to sing?

01:35:05.739 --> 01:35:08.739
Well, when are we going to get the new songbook?

01:35:08.739 --> 01:35:10.739
It's going to be a while.

01:35:10.739 --> 01:35:12.739
We don't know exactly when.

01:35:12.739 --> 01:35:14.739
The songs have been approved

01:35:14.739 --> 01:35:16.739
or even composed at this point,

01:35:16.739 --> 01:35:18.739
but you won't have to wait

01:35:18.739 --> 01:35:20.739
for the new songbook

01:35:20.739 --> 01:35:22.739
in order to sing the songs,

01:35:22.739 --> 01:35:25.739
because a number of new songs

01:35:25.739 --> 01:35:28.739
are going to be posted on our website,

01:35:28.739 --> 01:35:31.739
one at a time,

01:35:31.739 --> 01:35:33.739
and when a new song is released,

01:35:33.739 --> 01:35:35.739
it is going to be scheduled

01:35:35.739 --> 01:35:39.739
to be sung at the end of a service meeting.

01:35:39.739 --> 01:35:41.739
I believe that's beginning the week

01:35:41.739 --> 01:35:43.739
of January the 5th.

01:35:43.739 --> 01:35:45.739
So we're going to get a chance

01:35:45.739 --> 01:35:47.739
to sing those new songs.

01:35:47.739 --> 01:35:49.739
Now, of course, we know

01:35:49.739 --> 01:35:51.739
that not everyone has a computer,

01:35:51.739 --> 01:35:53.739
not everyone has access to one,

01:35:53.739 --> 01:35:56.739
not everyone knows how to download a song

01:35:56.739 --> 01:35:58.739
and the lyrics,

01:35:58.739 --> 01:35:59.739
so it means that those

01:35:59.739 --> 01:36:00.739
who do know how to do this

01:36:00.739 --> 01:36:02.739
will have to be thinking

01:36:02.739 --> 01:36:03.739
of their brothers and sisters,

01:36:03.739 --> 01:36:05.739
because everyone is going to want

01:36:05.739 --> 01:36:08.739
to be able to prepare

01:36:08.739 --> 01:36:11.739
and participate in the meetings.

01:36:11.739 --> 01:36:14.739
Well, now, for the benefit

01:36:14.739 --> 01:36:16.739
of those of you who weren't present

01:36:16.739 --> 01:36:18.739
on Monday night,

01:36:18.739 --> 01:36:20.739
we are going to take the first song

01:36:20.739 --> 01:36:22.739
on your sheet,

01:36:22.739 --> 01:36:24.739
song A,

01:36:24.739 --> 01:36:28.739
and this one was specially composed

01:36:28.739 --> 01:36:30.739
to mark the 100th anniversary

01:36:30.739 --> 01:36:32.739
of the establishment of the Kingdom.

01:36:32.739 --> 01:36:33.739
It's entitled,

01:36:33.739 --> 01:36:36.739
The Kingdom is in place,

01:36:36.739 --> 01:36:39.739
let it come.

01:36:39.739 --> 01:36:41.739
And the way we're going to do it,

01:36:41.739 --> 01:36:43.739
we're going to demonstrate

01:36:43.739 --> 01:36:45.739
the entire song first,

01:36:45.739 --> 01:36:47.739
and then we're going to demonstrate

01:36:47.739 --> 01:36:49.739
portions of the song,

01:36:49.739 --> 01:36:51.739
and we will give you a chance

01:36:51.739 --> 01:36:53.739
to practice that portion of the song

01:36:53.739 --> 01:36:55.739
until we've done one verse completely,

01:36:55.739 --> 01:36:58.739
and at the end we'll have you all rise,

01:36:58.739 --> 01:37:00.739
and we will sing both verses

01:37:00.739 --> 01:37:02.739
of the Kingdom is in place,

01:37:02.739 --> 01:37:04.739
let it come.

01:37:04.739 --> 01:37:06.739
We're expecting great things this morning.

01:37:06.739 --> 01:37:11.880
You'll thank me later.

01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:13.880
The Watchtower chorus,

01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:15.880
the entire Watchtower chorus,

01:37:15.880 --> 01:38:25.050
is here to help us.

01:38:25.050 --> 01:39:42.020
You can do that.

01:39:42.020 --> 01:39:44.020
It'll be fun.

01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:47.020
Now, you'll notice on top of each bar,

01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:50.020
there is a number,

01:39:50.020 --> 01:39:52.020
one, two, three, four.

01:39:52.020 --> 01:39:54.020
Those are the numbers of the measures

01:39:54.020 --> 01:39:56.020
and so from time to time,

01:39:56.020 --> 01:39:58.020
we're going to be referring to them.

01:39:58.020 --> 01:40:00.020
Now, in this segment, we'll do song A.

01:40:00.020 --> 01:40:03.020
Later on, our regular choral conductor,

01:40:03.020 --> 01:40:05.020
Brother Carlo Capano,

01:40:05.020 --> 01:40:07.020
is going to be working with us

01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:08.020
on the other two songs.

01:40:08.020 --> 01:40:10.020
So right now,

01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:12.020
what we're going to do is practice

01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:15.020
bars one through eight.

01:40:15.020 --> 01:40:18.020
The chorus will demonstrate,

01:40:18.020 --> 01:40:22.020
and then you are going to be able to participate.

01:40:22.020 --> 01:40:25.020
So this is bars one through eight.

01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:28.020
So each time we'll get a cue from the piano,

01:40:28.020 --> 01:40:30.020
I will count one, two, three,

01:40:30.020 --> 01:40:32.020
and then we sing.

01:40:32.020 --> 01:40:34.020
Listen to the chorus first.

01:40:34.020 --> 01:41:13.180
Now it's your turn.

01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:15.180
So we'll give you the cue,

01:41:15.180 --> 01:41:18.180
and then I will count one, two, three,

01:41:18.180 --> 01:41:21.180
and then a mighty roar of praise

01:41:21.180 --> 01:41:24.180
is going to go up from this room.

01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:34.300
Two, three.

01:41:34.300 --> 01:42:05.180
We didn't get this song three months ago.

01:42:05.180 --> 01:42:07.180
That's wonderful.

01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:12.180
Now we'll go on to measures nine through 12.

01:42:12.180 --> 01:42:14.180
The chorus will demonstrate,

01:42:14.180 --> 01:43:32.600
and then we will reciprocate to 20.

01:43:32.600 --> 01:45:10.039
We're going to demonstrate one complete verse,

01:45:10.039 --> 01:45:12.039
one complete verse only,

01:45:12.039 --> 01:45:15.039
but then we will have you stand,

01:45:15.039 --> 01:45:18.039
and you will sing the entire song,

01:45:18.039 --> 01:45:19.039
both verses.

01:45:19.039 --> 01:45:22.039
Now the reason for this is because we want you to get

01:45:22.039 --> 01:45:24.039
to know the introduction,

01:45:24.039 --> 01:45:28.039
how we fit the introduction in with the beginning of the song.

01:45:28.039 --> 01:46:50.399
So they will do the one complete verse.

01:46:50.399 --> 01:46:53.399
Official song that we're using as an interlude

01:46:53.399 --> 01:46:55.399
in the annual meeting part.

01:46:55.399 --> 01:46:57.399
So please rise,

01:46:57.399 --> 01:47:03.779
and we will sing the entire song from beginning to end.

01:47:03.779 --> 01:47:06.779
And you are doing a magnificent job.

01:47:06.779 --> 01:49:44.159
Maybe seated.

01:49:44.159 --> 01:49:55.359
Arveless way, that was to mark this 100th anniversary,

01:49:55.359 --> 01:49:58.359
a song written especially for the occasion.

01:49:58.359 --> 01:50:01.359
Well, I think we'll all be happy to say to all the ages

01:50:01.359 --> 01:50:04.359
to come that we were present the first time it was sung.

01:50:04.359 --> 01:50:08.659
But now, brothers and sisters, as you well know,

01:50:08.659 --> 01:50:11.659
those of you who regularly have attended the annual meeting,

01:50:11.659 --> 01:50:13.659
in interviews,

01:50:13.659 --> 01:50:17.659
have always been a highlight of our annual meeting program.

01:50:17.659 --> 01:50:19.659
And so now we're looking forward to hearing

01:50:19.659 --> 01:50:21.659
Brother Garrett Loach of the governing body,

01:50:21.659 --> 01:50:25.659
interview six long-time Bethel family members.

01:50:25.659 --> 01:50:27.659
Please give it your attention.

01:50:27.659 --> 01:50:35.180
It's a privilege now to interview three couples

01:50:35.180 --> 01:50:37.180
at Bethel, long-timers,

01:50:37.180 --> 01:50:41.180
namely Don and Nancy Commerce,

01:50:41.180 --> 01:50:45.180
Elsie and Rita Cotton,

01:50:45.180 --> 01:50:48.180
and Ray and Martha Rambo.

01:50:48.180 --> 01:50:51.180
And we would like you to introduce yourselves,

01:50:51.180 --> 01:50:55.180
and maybe we can start with you, Brother Commerce.

01:50:55.180 --> 01:50:58.180
I was born in 1941 and grew up in Washington State

01:50:58.180 --> 01:51:02.180
in a family of witnesses.

01:51:02.180 --> 01:51:05.180
I was baptized in 1949.

01:51:05.180 --> 01:51:09.180
In 1954, our family decided to serve where the need was great.

01:51:09.180 --> 01:51:14.180
In 1956, it became my turn to join the Pioneer ranks.

01:51:14.180 --> 01:51:16.180
And from that time forward, for many, many years,

01:51:16.180 --> 01:51:20.180
we did serve in various places throughout the United States,

01:51:20.180 --> 01:51:23.180
even including Peru, South America.

01:51:23.180 --> 01:51:25.180
I was invited to Bethel,

01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:28.180
and enjoyed serving here for over four years,

01:51:28.180 --> 01:51:32.180
but then decided to marry and leave Bethel.

01:51:32.180 --> 01:51:35.180
We were assigned then in the special Pioneer work

01:51:35.180 --> 01:51:36.180
to the South.

01:51:36.180 --> 01:51:40.180
And in 1970, we were invited into the circuit work.

01:51:40.180 --> 01:51:45.180
In 1979, I was invited back to Bethel, sort of recycled,

01:51:45.180 --> 01:51:49.180
and I've been serving here for the last 35 years

01:51:49.180 --> 01:51:50.180
in various departments.

01:51:50.180 --> 01:51:53.180
Currently, I work in the healthcare support department

01:51:53.180 --> 01:51:55.180
that takes care of the medical needs

01:51:55.180 --> 01:51:59.180
of the traveling overseers and special pioneers.

01:51:59.180 --> 01:52:00.180
Thank you.

01:52:00.180 --> 01:52:03.180
And, Sister Commerce, what can you add from your angle?

01:52:03.180 --> 01:52:05.180
My mother and I were the first ones to be baptized.

01:52:05.180 --> 01:52:09.180
We were baptized in Providence, Rhode Island in 1959.

01:52:09.180 --> 01:52:13.180
I started to pioneer in 1965 in Hartford, Connecticut.

01:52:13.180 --> 01:52:16.180
Don and I met at a circuit assembly in the Bronx,

01:52:16.180 --> 01:52:19.180
and about a year and a half later, we were married.

01:52:19.180 --> 01:52:21.180
And that's one of my exciting life

01:52:21.180 --> 01:52:25.180
of special full-time service and travel began.

01:52:25.180 --> 01:52:27.180
We specialed for several years,

01:52:27.180 --> 01:52:29.180
and then we were invited into the circuit work.

01:52:29.180 --> 01:52:34.180
And then in 1979, we were invited to Bethel in Brooklyn,

01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:36.180
and we've been in Brooklyn the whole time.

01:52:36.180 --> 01:52:39.180
Well, thank you very much, Brother Cotton.

01:52:39.180 --> 01:52:41.180
Maybe here from you, how you got the truth,

01:52:41.180 --> 01:52:44.180
how you started pioneering and so on.

01:52:44.180 --> 01:52:49.180
I was baptized in February 29, 1964.

01:52:49.180 --> 01:52:53.180
I started to pioneer October 1, 1966.

01:52:53.180 --> 01:52:55.180
And since I wanted to come to Bethel,

01:52:55.180 --> 01:52:58.180
I had to secure a 4D classification

01:52:58.180 --> 01:53:02.180
from the local draft board.

01:53:02.180 --> 01:53:06.180
In the appeal that I made to the draft board,

01:53:06.180 --> 01:53:09.180
a number of members of the draft board said

01:53:09.180 --> 01:53:13.180
I was simply too young to be classified

01:53:13.180 --> 01:53:15.180
as a minister.

01:53:15.180 --> 01:53:20.180
A reason privately that I am too young to be considered a minister,

01:53:20.180 --> 01:53:24.180
but I'm not too young to fight in the Vietnam War.

01:53:24.180 --> 01:53:28.180
I later learned that the FBI investigated me.

01:53:28.180 --> 01:53:31.180
They must have been convinced that I was a minister

01:53:31.180 --> 01:53:33.180
because I received a 4D classification,

01:53:33.180 --> 01:53:37.180
and then I was able to finally apply for Bethel's service.

01:53:37.180 --> 01:53:41.180
I received an invitation to Bethel's service signed

01:53:41.180 --> 01:53:45.180
by Brother Nathan Nor in May of 1968.

01:53:45.180 --> 01:53:50.180
And then in 1972, a left Bethel got married.

01:53:50.180 --> 01:53:55.180
And then Rita and I, we served in a small town in Matta, Georgia.

01:53:55.180 --> 01:54:00.180
And then we received an invitation to come back to Bethel in 1978,

01:54:00.180 --> 01:54:02.180
this summer of that year.

01:54:02.180 --> 01:54:07.180
For the last 17 years, I've worked in hospital information services.

01:54:07.180 --> 01:54:09.180
Thank you.

01:54:09.180 --> 01:54:12.180
Sister Cotton, what can you tell us about yourself?

01:54:12.180 --> 01:54:15.180
In 1960, I was baptized at a district convention

01:54:15.180 --> 01:54:19.180
in Kansas City, Missouri, along with two of my brothers.

01:54:19.180 --> 01:54:23.180
So in 1969, I began my career as a regular pioneer

01:54:23.180 --> 01:54:26.180
against the advice of my teachers and school counselors

01:54:26.180 --> 01:54:28.180
who wanted me not only to go to college,

01:54:28.180 --> 01:54:34.180
but to pursue a career in track and field.

01:54:34.180 --> 01:54:37.180
And a few years later, LC and I were married

01:54:37.180 --> 01:54:40.180
and regular pioneer for a few years together.

01:54:40.180 --> 01:54:46.180
We received our invitation in a letter dated May 31, 1978,

01:54:46.180 --> 01:54:49.180
and to come and be part of the Bethel family here in Brooklyn.

01:54:49.180 --> 01:54:52.180
I was assigned to the shipping department,

01:54:52.180 --> 01:54:56.180
which later divided and formed the transportation department.

01:54:56.180 --> 01:54:58.180
And that is where I'm presently working.

01:54:58.180 --> 01:55:00.180
Thank you very much.

01:55:00.180 --> 01:55:04.180
Well, for the Rambo, I hear that you had an interesting way

01:55:04.180 --> 01:55:06.180
of being contacted with the truth.

01:55:06.180 --> 01:55:09.180
Could you tell us more about it?

01:55:09.180 --> 01:55:13.180
I got a barbering cosmology license.

01:55:13.180 --> 01:55:17.180
I opened up a beauty studio.

01:55:17.180 --> 01:55:21.180
In 1956, I was cutting a lady's hair,

01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:26.180
and she showed me Jehovah's name in the Bible.

01:55:26.180 --> 01:55:29.180
And then she and her husband began calling on me

01:55:29.180 --> 01:55:34.180
and showed me that Jehovah and Jesus were not the same person.

01:55:34.180 --> 01:55:37.180
There was no Trinity.

01:55:37.180 --> 01:55:41.180
The soul wasn't immortal, that the soul dies.

01:55:41.180 --> 01:55:46.180
So I began to understand what the Bible really said.

01:55:46.180 --> 01:55:52.180
So then in 1957, I got baptized.

01:55:52.180 --> 01:55:55.180
1958, I started pioneering.

01:55:55.180 --> 01:56:00.180
And I've been in the full-time service for the past 56 years.

01:56:00.180 --> 01:56:04.180
I was pioneering, we went to circuit work and hered Bethel.

01:56:04.180 --> 01:56:09.180
So those 56 years were the best years I could have ever spent.

01:56:09.180 --> 01:56:10.180
Thank you very much.

01:56:10.180 --> 01:56:13.180
And Sister Rambo, I understand you have an interesting story

01:56:13.180 --> 01:56:16.460
to tell as well.

01:56:16.460 --> 01:56:19.460
Well, I don't know how interesting,

01:56:19.460 --> 01:56:23.460
but my dad got the truth in about 1938.

01:56:23.460 --> 01:56:26.460
And I was around two years old.

01:56:26.460 --> 01:56:29.460
So I learned the truth from him.

01:56:29.460 --> 01:56:32.460
He said on his lap, and he would tell me about the new world

01:56:32.460 --> 01:56:34.460
and about the animals.

01:56:34.460 --> 01:56:37.460
And I really even, in those young years,

01:56:37.460 --> 01:56:43.460
I accepted that this was right and that this was the truth.

01:56:43.460 --> 01:56:48.460
I only got to a kingdom hall when we moved to Duwajak, Michigan.

01:56:48.460 --> 01:56:52.460
But by that time, my dad was pretty sick.

01:56:52.460 --> 01:56:57.460
And the first meeting that I actually attended was his funeral.

01:56:57.460 --> 01:57:01.460
But after that, I continued to go to the meetings.

01:57:01.460 --> 01:57:07.460
And I was baptized at age 17, 1953.

01:57:07.460 --> 01:57:12.460
And then I started to pioneer in 1956.

01:57:12.460 --> 01:57:19.460
So I've been in full-time service for 58 years, like, for their comers.

01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:22.460
Well, thank you very much for your comments.

01:57:22.460 --> 01:57:27.460
As we all know, not only in the world are changes happening,

01:57:27.460 --> 01:57:30.460
also within Jehovah's organization.

01:57:30.460 --> 01:57:35.460
And sometimes these changes seem to happen quickly, rapidly.

01:57:35.460 --> 01:57:42.460
So we would like you to tell us how the changes within the organization

01:57:42.460 --> 01:57:47.460
have affected you and how you feel about them.

01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:51.460
But before we invite you to comment on this,

01:57:51.460 --> 01:57:56.460
just one reference to Isaiah 67 that came to my mind

01:57:56.460 --> 01:57:59.460
is that it was even prophesied in the Bible

01:57:59.460 --> 01:58:03.460
that there would be organizational adjustments, improvements.

01:58:03.460 --> 01:58:08.460
And it says in verse 17, instead of the copper,

01:58:08.460 --> 01:58:10.460
I will bring in gold.

01:58:10.460 --> 01:58:13.460
And instead of the iron, I will bring in silver.

01:58:13.460 --> 01:58:18.460
Instead of the wood, copper, and instead of the stones, iron.

01:58:19.460 --> 01:58:23.460
So we see that this finds fulfillment now.

01:58:23.460 --> 01:58:28.460
And so please tell us how you feel about the changes

01:58:28.460 --> 01:58:31.460
that are happening within the organization.

01:58:31.460 --> 01:58:33.460
Let's start with brother commerce again.

01:58:33.460 --> 01:58:37.460
There's always been a focus, and that has been to advertise the kingdom.

01:58:37.460 --> 01:58:42.460
And many different ways have been utilized to accomplish that.

01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:46.460
Right now we're using carts and tables.

01:58:46.460 --> 01:58:51.460
And the witnessing is very effective using these two means.

01:58:51.460 --> 01:58:54.460
It seems no matter where you go in the world, you can find them.

01:58:54.460 --> 01:58:57.460
If you go high up into the Andes Mountains,

01:58:57.460 --> 01:59:00.460
the markets have them there.

01:59:00.460 --> 01:59:03.460
If you go to seaports, they're there.

01:59:03.460 --> 01:59:06.460
I've seen them in Macau, I've seen them in Hong Kong,

01:59:06.460 --> 01:59:09.460
I've seen them in the Roman Forum, in Naples.

01:59:09.460 --> 01:59:12.460
No matter where you go, these carts are out there.

01:59:12.460 --> 01:59:15.460
And it's an amazing thing to see.

01:59:15.460 --> 01:59:18.460
And that's coupled with the JW.org.

01:59:18.460 --> 01:59:22.460
Here's an opportunity for people no matter where they live

01:59:22.460 --> 01:59:27.460
to have contact with Jehovah's word and his people.

01:59:27.460 --> 01:59:30.460
Certainly it's beyond our expectations.

01:59:30.460 --> 01:59:34.460
I just saw the figures, now there are 550 languages

01:59:34.460 --> 01:59:36.460
that you can look at that site in.

01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:41.460
And from the site you can download over 700 languages.

01:59:42.460 --> 01:59:46.460
So really this website is going where we cannot.

01:59:46.460 --> 01:59:48.460
Spiritual food flows to them.

01:59:48.460 --> 01:59:51.460
And it's carefully designed and presented

01:59:51.460 --> 01:59:53.460
so that it's done in an appealing way.

01:59:53.460 --> 01:59:55.460
What's known about the results?

01:59:55.460 --> 01:59:58.460
That's very interesting.

01:59:58.460 --> 02:00:01.460
In the first some of the days in August,

02:00:01.460 --> 02:00:07.460
1.5 million visits were made on a daily basis to that site.

02:00:07.460 --> 02:00:11.460
They now have videos, one video in particular.

02:00:11.460 --> 02:00:16.460
Why study the Bible is available in 520 different languages.

02:00:16.460 --> 02:00:18.460
It's just an amazing thing to watch.

02:00:18.460 --> 02:00:21.460
How does it relate to Bible study activity?

02:00:21.460 --> 02:00:28.460
Well, in the first two years, 100,000 requests have been made

02:00:28.460 --> 02:00:31.460
for Bible studies over JW.org.

02:00:31.460 --> 02:00:34.460
Well, that's fantastic, isn't it?

02:00:34.460 --> 02:00:37.460
Wonderful change to have the website now.

02:00:37.460 --> 02:00:40.460
Well, Sister Cromers, may we hear from you?

02:00:40.460 --> 02:00:44.460
And how you feel about some of the changes?

02:00:44.460 --> 02:00:47.460
Well, I've been thrilled to see the arrangements that have been made

02:00:47.460 --> 02:00:49.460
by the faithful and discreet slave.

02:00:49.460 --> 02:00:53.460
For example, in October last year,

02:00:53.460 --> 02:00:56.460
we were delighted to receive the revised version

02:00:56.460 --> 02:00:58.460
of the New World translation.

02:00:58.460 --> 02:01:00.460
How easy it is to read.

02:01:00.460 --> 02:01:03.460
And for my personal studying, I really enjoy it.

02:01:03.460 --> 02:01:05.460
Two, we have the simplified watch tower.

02:01:05.460 --> 02:01:08.460
And we've seen amazing results from that.

02:01:08.460 --> 02:01:11.460
Don already referred to the website.

02:01:11.460 --> 02:01:13.460
I'm excited at introducing it to people,

02:01:13.460 --> 02:01:17.460
because I know it's been designed to appeal to the Internet user.

02:01:17.460 --> 02:01:20.460
They want their material crisp and clear.

02:01:20.460 --> 02:01:22.460
And they want it appealing.

02:01:22.460 --> 02:01:25.460
So that's what we've endeavour to do.

02:01:25.460 --> 02:01:27.460
I've also enjoyed the videos.

02:01:27.460 --> 02:01:30.460
So in August, I showed the video to a young man.

02:01:30.460 --> 02:01:32.460
I showed the video why study the Bible.

02:01:32.460 --> 02:01:34.460
And he was very quiet.

02:01:34.460 --> 02:01:36.460
And at the end, he paused.

02:01:36.460 --> 02:01:38.460
And he just looked at me and said,

02:01:38.460 --> 02:01:40.460
I get it.

02:01:40.460 --> 02:01:42.460
Well, I don't know where that'll go.

02:01:42.460 --> 02:01:45.460
But all of these wonderful arrangements have been a blessing from Jehovah

02:01:45.460 --> 02:01:48.460
that he's provided through the governing body.

02:01:48.460 --> 02:01:50.460
Thank you very much.

02:01:50.460 --> 02:01:53.460
Well, next we'll hear from Brother Carton.

02:01:53.460 --> 02:01:57.460
And what can you tell us about your feelings,

02:01:57.460 --> 02:02:00.460
about the certain changes in the organization?

02:02:00.460 --> 02:02:04.460
Brother Loach, for me, there have been so many beneficial changes

02:02:04.460 --> 02:02:07.460
in Jehovah's organization since I have been in the truth.

02:02:07.460 --> 02:02:15.460
All of the assembly programs are posted online for us to download.

02:02:15.460 --> 02:02:18.460
And during a session of family worship,

02:02:18.460 --> 02:02:22.460
we're able to review the scriptures, meditate on the scriptures.

02:02:22.460 --> 02:02:26.460
And then when the brother actually gives the talk of the assembly,

02:02:26.460 --> 02:02:29.460
we can anticipate what he's going to say.

02:02:29.460 --> 02:02:31.460
We can follow along.

02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:34.460
And this has had a beneficial effect on me,

02:02:34.460 --> 02:02:38.460
as far as understanding the points clearly having them in mind,

02:02:38.460 --> 02:02:41.460
and the application to us as servants of Jehovah.

02:02:41.460 --> 02:02:48.460
To me, it is so clear that the governing body wants us to have a good relationship with Jehovah.

02:02:48.460 --> 02:02:51.460
And they want us to live, and they love us.

02:02:51.460 --> 02:02:55.460
And all of these provisions are an indication of that kind of thing.

02:02:55.460 --> 02:02:57.460
Well, thank you, and Sister Carton.

02:02:57.460 --> 02:03:00.460
How do you feel about the changes, recent changes?

02:03:00.460 --> 02:03:03.460
Well, I was thinking about the changes in connection with our meetings

02:03:03.460 --> 02:03:06.460
in particular, the congregation book study.

02:03:06.460 --> 02:03:09.460
When it was combined to be held on the same evening

02:03:09.460 --> 02:03:12.460
as at theocratic school and service meeting, it was a big change.

02:03:12.460 --> 02:03:18.460
But I found personally that I benefited from the change that has been made with the book study,

02:03:18.460 --> 02:03:25.460
because we have one more evening a week to study as individuals or in family worship.

02:03:25.460 --> 02:03:29.460
And it all shows me that the governing body really loves the worldwide brotherhood,

02:03:29.460 --> 02:03:32.460
and that they really want us to be spiritually strong.

02:03:32.460 --> 02:03:33.460
Thank you very much.

02:03:33.460 --> 02:03:35.460
Now, let's switch to Sister Rambo.

02:03:35.460 --> 02:03:41.460
There's certain things and changes that happened in the organization that enthused you, too.

02:03:41.460 --> 02:03:43.460
So tell us about it.

02:03:43.460 --> 02:03:50.460
I appreciate the new arrangement of having 30 hours as an auxiliary pioneer.

02:03:50.460 --> 02:03:53.460
So we could either do 30 or 50.

02:03:54.460 --> 02:03:58.460
I understand that you're taking advantage of this from time to time.

02:03:58.460 --> 02:04:00.460
Yes, and I've really enjoyed it.

02:04:00.460 --> 02:04:03.460
I've done it twice this year so far.

02:04:03.460 --> 02:04:11.460
Recently, we had an announcement at the Bethel table in connection with an arrangement for Bethelites,

02:04:11.460 --> 02:04:14.460
and that's new. Can you tell us about this?

02:04:14.460 --> 02:04:19.460
Yes. Now, Bethelites have the opportunity to go to Pioneer School.

02:04:19.460 --> 02:04:23.460
And I'm really excited about that, because for me, I've never been before,

02:04:23.460 --> 02:04:27.460
since they didn't have Pioneer School when I was pioneering.

02:04:27.460 --> 02:04:29.460
Well, thank you very much.

02:04:29.460 --> 02:04:34.460
Brother Rambo, you have been over the years working a lot with a design office,

02:04:34.460 --> 02:04:37.460
and that has to do with buildings.

02:04:37.460 --> 02:04:40.460
Would you be able to tell us about what impressed you?

02:04:40.460 --> 02:04:43.460
Many things have happened just here in Brooklyn.

02:04:43.460 --> 02:04:48.460
For example, in 1975, we purchased a tower's hotel.

02:04:48.460 --> 02:04:50.460
We still have that.

02:04:50.460 --> 02:04:57.460
In the early 80s, the 25 Columbia Heights building was renovated,

02:04:57.460 --> 02:05:00.460
and now there's offices all through that building.

02:05:00.460 --> 02:05:06.460
And in 1983, we purchased the 360 Ferman Complex,

02:05:06.460 --> 02:05:09.460
which is a huge complex of buildings.

02:05:09.460 --> 02:05:16.460
And then in 1986, they purchased a land area for the 90 sands building

02:05:16.460 --> 02:05:19.460
that they built in 1995.

02:05:19.460 --> 02:05:23.460
So just here in Brooklyn, we've seen many things take place.

02:05:23.460 --> 02:05:32.460
But even more important, the announcement we heard in 2013 that in Warwick, New York,

02:05:32.460 --> 02:05:36.460
they gave the approval, the town gave the approval that we would build.

02:05:36.460 --> 02:05:40.460
The World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses in that Warwick area.

02:05:40.460 --> 02:05:43.460
So we're looking forward to the future.

02:05:43.460 --> 02:05:48.460
What Jehovah has in store for the changes we've been taking place.

02:05:48.460 --> 02:05:53.460
And that will be a big change to move to the New World Headquarters.

02:05:53.460 --> 02:05:58.460
Maybe we can have another one or two commons in conclusion from

02:05:58.460 --> 02:06:03.460
rather commons and rather cotton about the same point about the changes.

02:06:03.460 --> 02:06:06.460
And who to attribute it to?

02:06:06.460 --> 02:06:09.460
It's hard to know how to describe all the changes.

02:06:09.460 --> 02:06:11.460
There could be many, many expressions made.

02:06:11.460 --> 02:06:16.460
But from my standpoint, I think what the Psalmist said says it all.

02:06:16.460 --> 02:06:21.460
In Psalm 118, verse 23, this has come from Jehovah.

02:06:21.460 --> 02:06:23.460
It's wonderful in our eyes.

02:06:23.460 --> 02:06:25.460
And brother cotton?

02:06:25.460 --> 02:06:33.460
And I feel the same way brother Loes, that the most powerful force in all the universe,

02:06:33.460 --> 02:06:38.460
operating on the instrument that Jehovah God is clearly using in this time of the end.

02:06:39.460 --> 02:06:44.460
And he has moved the coming body to make all of these beneficial changes.

02:06:44.460 --> 02:06:50.460
And to me, it is as Matthew chapter 21, verse 42 says,

02:06:50.460 --> 02:06:55.460
it is from Jehovah and it is wonderful for us to see.

02:06:55.460 --> 02:06:58.460
Well, thank you very much for your comments.

02:06:58.460 --> 02:07:01.460
Well, what can we all learn from it?

02:07:01.460 --> 02:07:05.460
Whether we are serving at Bethel or outside Bethel.

02:07:05.460 --> 02:07:12.460
Well, we can see that Jehovah's spirit is moving things and that there are rapid changes.

02:07:12.460 --> 02:07:20.460
So for us, the question is, are we keeping up with the pace of Jehovah's forward moving organization?

02:07:20.460 --> 02:07:24.460
And to the end, that it all serves to glorify Jehovah.

02:07:24.460 --> 02:07:46.800
Well, we sincerely thank you, brother Loes, and all those that you interviewed today,

02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:50.800
we were very moved by their fine expressions.

02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:57.800
So now we have the privilege to hear four scriptural talks by members of the governing body.

02:07:57.800 --> 02:08:01.800
So we encourage you now to take out your notebooks,

02:08:01.800 --> 02:08:08.800
because you are one to benefit fully from these historic discourses that we are about to hear.

02:08:08.800 --> 02:08:14.800
To begin, brother David's plane of the governing body will speak to us on the theme,

02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:23.850
types and anti-types.

02:08:23.850 --> 02:08:31.850
Let's get right into our subject, types and anti-types.

02:08:31.850 --> 02:08:40.850
Now, years ago, our publications often applied certain Bible accounts

02:08:40.850 --> 02:08:46.850
and certain Bible characters as types of something greater.

02:08:46.850 --> 02:08:51.850
But you've noticed that in recent years, that has seldom done.

02:08:51.850 --> 02:08:57.850
And the purpose of this talk is to explain why.

02:08:57.850 --> 02:09:03.850
First of all, what is a type and what is an anti-type?

02:09:03.850 --> 02:09:08.850
Well, a much tower of September 15, 1950 defined them this way.

02:09:08.850 --> 02:09:16.850
It said, a type is a representation of something that will come to pass at a future time.

02:09:16.850 --> 02:09:23.850
The anti-type is the reality of the thing which the type represents.

02:09:23.850 --> 02:09:27.850
So that was the definition that was given by the watch tower.

02:09:27.850 --> 02:09:35.850
And we might add that Jehovah is usually involved in designing the type.

02:09:35.850 --> 02:09:38.850
Well, I'll take the tabernacle.

02:09:38.850 --> 02:09:43.850
Jehovah was very clear about the construction of the tabernacle,

02:09:43.850 --> 02:09:48.850
what materials were to be used, the dimensions and so forth.

02:09:48.850 --> 02:09:50.850
Why?

02:09:50.850 --> 02:09:56.850
Well, apparently because he had designed the tabernacle to be a type of something greater.

02:09:56.850 --> 02:09:59.850
His great spiritual temple.

02:09:59.850 --> 02:10:03.850
And the temple is the anti-type.

02:10:03.850 --> 02:10:06.850
The sacrifices on the day of atonement.

02:10:06.850 --> 02:10:10.850
Jehovah was very careful about how events on the day of atonement were to unfold.

02:10:11.850 --> 02:10:20.850
And again, he realized that something was going to have to picture or foreshadow the perfect sacrifice of Jesus Christ.

02:10:20.850 --> 02:10:29.850
So the sacrifices on the day of atonement, the type, the sacrifice, the perfect sacrifice of Christ, the anti-type.

02:10:29.850 --> 02:10:32.850
Now consider another example.

02:10:32.850 --> 02:10:39.850
When the disobedient Israelites in the wilderness are bitten by poisonous snakes,

02:10:40.850 --> 02:10:48.850
Moses is told by Jehovah to fashion a copper serpent and to place that serpent on a pole.

02:10:48.850 --> 02:10:51.850
Now that was a type.

02:10:51.850 --> 02:10:54.850
And Jesus explained what it was a type of.

02:10:54.850 --> 02:11:09.850
Let's turn to John chapter 3, John chapter 3, and verses 14 and 15.

02:11:09.850 --> 02:11:17.630
John 3, 14 and 15.

02:11:17.630 --> 02:11:20.630
If you're using an iPad, I'll give you a chance to catch up.

02:11:20.630 --> 02:11:28.529
I couldn't resist.

02:11:28.529 --> 02:11:36.529
And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so the son of man must be lifted up.

02:11:36.529 --> 02:11:41.529
So that everyone believing in him may have everlasting life.

02:11:41.529 --> 02:11:45.529
Well, would anyone doubt that this is a type?

02:11:45.529 --> 02:11:47.529
Of course not.

02:11:47.529 --> 02:11:51.529
Because Jesus said it was.

02:11:51.529 --> 02:11:59.529
Well, notice that in both these examples, the tabernacle and the copper serpent, Jehovah was involved.

02:11:59.529 --> 02:12:05.529
He designed the type so that it would fit the anti-type.

02:12:05.529 --> 02:12:12.529
He told Moses, for example, to fashion a copper serpent and to put it not on a rock, but on a stake.

02:12:12.529 --> 02:12:18.529
And of course the tabernacle prefiguring the great spiritual temple.

02:12:18.529 --> 02:12:23.529
From the Apostle Paul, we learned a lot about types and anti-types.

02:12:23.529 --> 02:12:32.529
For example, Paul explains in his letter to the Hebrews that Isaiah and his two sons represent Jesus and the anointed.

02:12:32.529 --> 02:12:40.529
He also explains that Moses, the mediator of the law covenant, represents Christ, the mediator of the new covenant.

02:12:40.529 --> 02:12:56.529
And we learned from the letter to the Galatians that Abraham's relationship with Sarah and Higar represents Jehovah's relationship with the earthly nation of Israel and with the heavenly part of his organization.

02:12:56.529 --> 02:12:59.529
Type, anti-type.

02:12:59.529 --> 02:13:07.529
Now we know that these are genuine types because the word of God says they are.

02:13:07.529 --> 02:13:10.529
But here is the question.

02:13:10.529 --> 02:13:20.529
Who is to decide if a person or an event is a type, if the word of God doesn't say anything about it?

02:13:20.529 --> 02:13:24.529
Who is qualified to do that?

02:13:24.529 --> 02:13:26.529
Our answer?

02:13:26.529 --> 02:13:31.529
We can do no better than to quote our beloved brother, Albert Schroeder, who said,

02:13:31.529 --> 02:13:40.529
we need to exercise great care when applying accounts in the Hebrew scriptures as prophetic patterns or types.

02:13:40.529 --> 02:13:48.529
If these accounts are not applied in the scriptures themselves, it wasn't that a beautiful statement.

02:13:48.529 --> 02:13:50.529
We agree with it.

02:13:50.529 --> 02:13:56.529
Now the study of types and anti-types is not unique to Jehovah's witnesses.

02:13:56.529 --> 02:14:04.529
During the past 2,000 years, Catholic and Jewish scholars have made quite a diligent study of types and anti-types.

02:14:04.529 --> 02:14:09.529
In fact, there's even a name for this study. They call it typology.

02:14:09.529 --> 02:14:25.529
The first century Jewish scholar, Philo of Alexandria, for example, suggested that the serpent in the garden of Eden, the tree of knowledge, and the cherubs that were guarding the entrance to the garden were all typical of something greater.

02:14:25.529 --> 02:14:36.529
And then describing the teachings of such early writers as origin, Ambrose and Jerome, the international standard Bible encyclopedia says this.

02:14:36.529 --> 02:14:41.529
They sought for types, and of course found them.

02:14:41.529 --> 02:14:53.529
In every incident and event, however trivial recorded in Scripture, even the most simple and commonplace circumstance was thought to conceal within itself a hidden truth.

02:14:53.529 --> 02:15:00.529
Even in the number of fish caught by the disciples on the night the risen Savior appeared to them.

02:15:00.529 --> 02:15:09.130
He says, how much some have tried to make of that number 153?

02:15:09.130 --> 02:15:20.130
One scholar made much of Jacob's purchase of Esau's birthright with a bowl of red stew, very significant that the stew was red.

02:15:20.130 --> 02:15:25.130
To him, the red stew pictured the red blood of Christ.

02:15:25.130 --> 02:15:30.130
The inheritance pictured the heavenly inheritance.

02:15:30.130 --> 02:15:43.130
And so, by that reasoning, Jacob pictures Jesus, Esau's birthright pictures the heavenly inheritance and the red stew pictures Jesus precious blood.

02:15:43.130 --> 02:15:50.130
Now in the surface, that might sound plausible to some until you think about it.

02:15:50.130 --> 02:15:53.130
When you think about it, you find at least three problems.

02:15:53.130 --> 02:15:57.130
First of all, Jehovah didn't design the type.

02:15:57.130 --> 02:16:00.130
Jehovah did not tell Esau to sell his birthright.

02:16:00.130 --> 02:16:05.130
Selling his birthright was wrong, and Jehovah never tells us to do something that's wrong.

02:16:05.130 --> 02:16:10.130
Second, who ate the stew? Esau did.

02:16:10.130 --> 02:16:20.130
So, are we to conclude that by giving up his inheritance, Esau put himself in line for the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ?

02:16:20.130 --> 02:16:22.130
That doesn't make any sense.

02:16:22.130 --> 02:16:30.130
And most importantly, nowhere in scripture do we read that the event is a type.

02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:39.129
Now the study of types and anti-types was not only common among Catholic and Jewish scholars, but it was very popular among Protestants scholars as well.

02:16:39.129 --> 02:16:45.129
The Puritans, like Edward Taylor, applied many Bible events to themselves.

02:16:45.129 --> 02:16:49.129
The Baptists and Congregationalists did likewise.

02:16:49.129 --> 02:16:59.129
So, it's not surprising that the early Bible students who had generally belonged to these groups were also very fond of types.

02:16:59.129 --> 02:17:02.129
And so, have many of us been.

02:17:03.129 --> 02:17:13.129
Many of us remember happy moments at the Congregation Book Study, studying all about types and anti-types.

02:17:13.129 --> 02:17:17.129
And it's true that the study of types could be thrilling.

02:17:17.129 --> 02:17:19.129
So now here's a question.

02:17:19.129 --> 02:17:28.129
If the study of a certain subject makes chills run up and down your spine, could it possibly be mistaken?

02:17:28.129 --> 02:17:31.129
And the answer is yes.

02:17:31.129 --> 02:17:36.129
The case of Brother Arch W. Smith is an example.

02:17:36.129 --> 02:17:47.129
In 1886, Brother Russell published a book that contained a chart linking the ages of mankind to the great pyramid of Egypt.

02:17:47.129 --> 02:17:53.129
Now that pyramid was called by the Bible students, the Bible in stone.

02:17:53.129 --> 02:17:56.129
They loved the study of the pyramid.

02:17:56.129 --> 02:18:03.129
In fact, if you have seen pictures of Brother Russell's grave, you have noticed that there was a pyramid nearby.

02:18:03.129 --> 02:18:08.129
And that's because the Bible students believed very much in the great pyramid of Egypt.

02:18:08.129 --> 02:18:19.129
And some became very engrossed in measuring certain rooms and certain features of the pyramid to try to determine, for example, how long they had to wait before they went to heaven and so on.

02:18:19.129 --> 02:18:26.129
And so one who was just thrilled by the study of types was Brother Arch W. Smith.

02:18:26.129 --> 02:18:29.129
It was a hobby of his. He loved it.

02:18:29.129 --> 02:18:34.129
In fact, he gave a lot of prayerful thought to the dimensions of the pyramid.

02:18:34.129 --> 02:18:45.129
And from time to time, he would write into Bethel and let them know what his findings were to support the idea that the great pyramid had a place in Jehovah's purpose.

02:18:45.129 --> 02:18:48.129
He loved it.

02:18:48.129 --> 02:19:02.129
But when the watchtower of 1928 came out and said that Jehovah doesn't need a stone monument built by pagans to accomplish his purpose, Brother Smith accepted it.

02:19:02.129 --> 02:19:07.129
He let reason win out over emotion.

02:19:07.129 --> 02:19:21.129
Well, in recent years, the trend in our publications has been to look for the practical application of Bible events and not for types where the scriptures themselves do not clearly identify them as such.

02:19:21.129 --> 02:19:26.129
We simply cannot go beyond what is written.

02:19:26.129 --> 02:19:35.129
Now there's a real advantage in looking for the practical application of Bible accounts rather than confining certain applications to one class.

02:19:35.129 --> 02:19:39.129
This applies only to the anointed. This applies only to the other sheep.

02:19:39.129 --> 02:19:41.129
Let's see why.

02:19:41.129 --> 02:19:50.340
Turn to Romans chapter 15 and verse 4.

02:19:50.340 --> 02:19:54.340
And remember that Paul is writing to his anointed brothers here.

02:19:54.340 --> 02:20:03.069
Romans chapter 15 and verse 4.

02:20:03.069 --> 02:20:17.069
And he says, for all the things that were written beforehand, well, what things, the Hebrew scriptures, obviously, were written for our instruction.

02:20:17.069 --> 02:20:26.069
So that through our endurance and through the comfort from the scriptures, we might have hope.

02:20:26.069 --> 02:20:33.069
He's telling us Paul telling the anointed. He's telling them that you can learn from these accounts in the Hebrew scriptures.

02:20:33.069 --> 02:20:37.069
You can apply the principles of the Hebrew scriptures to yourselves.

02:20:37.069 --> 02:20:40.069
Let's consider an example.

02:20:40.069 --> 02:20:45.069
Now soon after his conversion, Paul is preaching in the city of Damascus.

02:20:45.069 --> 02:20:49.069
The Jews are furious and they try to kill him.

02:20:49.069 --> 02:21:00.069
So anointed disciples take Paul and they lower him down the city wall in a basket.

02:21:00.069 --> 02:21:09.069
Is it possible that some of those anointed ones, a thought of Rahab, who helped the two spies escape from Jericho by a similar method?

02:21:09.069 --> 02:21:17.069
What anyone say to them, you can't apply that to yourselves. Rahab pictures the other sheep. You are the anointed.

02:21:17.069 --> 02:21:23.069
No, they could apply the lessons of that account to themselves.

02:21:23.069 --> 02:21:27.069
Now let's consider another example, a modern one.

02:21:27.069 --> 02:21:36.069
In the Song of Solomon, we read of a chaste young virgin who falls desperately in love with a poor shepherd boy.

02:21:36.069 --> 02:21:44.069
Solomon, who incidentally was still an inspired Bible writer at the time, but he's a very wealthy man.

02:21:44.069 --> 02:21:49.069
He tries to lure her away, but he is unable to do so.

02:21:49.069 --> 02:21:57.069
Now suppose that in a certain congregation there's a sweet young sister, who falls head over heels for a poor pioneer brother,

02:21:57.069 --> 02:22:01.069
who is a real spiritual man, but he doesn't have a penny to his name.

02:22:01.069 --> 02:22:12.069
Now her friends encourage her to marry a wealthy brother, who is very rich, but he doesn't have a lot of time for spiritual things.

02:22:12.069 --> 02:22:19.069
But the sister remains firm. They say, you wouldn't have to work, you can pioneer.

02:22:19.069 --> 02:22:24.069
She says, no, my love is for that pioneer boy.

02:22:24.069 --> 02:22:32.069
Would anyone say to her, the Song of Solomon doesn't apply to you because you're of the other sheep, not of the anointed.

02:22:32.069 --> 02:22:41.069
You see how practical it is to take these Bible accounts and really apply them to the everyday life of people.

02:22:42.069 --> 02:22:45.069
Well, what about others of the other sheep today?

02:22:45.069 --> 02:22:52.069
In this audience, there are modern day Nehemiahs who are spurring the building programs we have.

02:22:52.069 --> 02:22:59.069
Wonderful young Timothy's, graduates of our Bible schools, warm-hearted Tabithas, hospitable Lydia's.

02:22:59.069 --> 02:23:10.069
And don't we find exceptional young circuit overseers who are like a lie here, in giving wise counsel to elders who are much older than they.

02:23:10.069 --> 02:23:23.069
And don't many Christian women remind us of dear Rebecca, who was willing to follow her husband to a distant land for the accomplishment of Jehovah's purpose.

02:23:23.069 --> 02:23:30.069
We deeply appreciate the spiritual heritage that was passed on to us by the early Bible students.

02:23:30.069 --> 02:23:38.069
In harmony with Zechariah chapter 4 and verse 10, we do not despise the day of small things.

02:23:38.069 --> 02:23:47.069
However, the light does get brighter and we feel that we must follow the light wherever it leads us.

02:23:47.069 --> 02:23:54.069
Our love should be for the truth and not for a particular doctrine or teaching.

02:23:54.069 --> 02:23:59.069
Well, how would you summarize this talk in a few words?

02:23:59.069 --> 02:24:05.069
The wrong answer is we don't believe in types and anti-types anymore.

02:24:05.069 --> 02:24:08.069
We do. We most certainly do.

02:24:08.069 --> 02:24:13.069
Where the scriptures identify them as such, we embrace them.

02:24:13.069 --> 02:24:18.069
But where the Bible is silent, we must be silent.

02:24:18.069 --> 02:24:25.069
Now in the three talks that follow, there are going to be important clarifications in our beliefs.

02:24:25.069 --> 02:24:29.069
Perhaps a certain adjustment will touch a spiritual nerve.

02:24:29.069 --> 02:24:33.069
Make us rethink a cherished teaching.

02:24:33.069 --> 02:24:42.069
Our love for Jehovah and for the truth will move us to receive this information gladly and with open hearts.

02:24:42.069 --> 02:24:49.069
Often today, we hear brothers say, we're having a hard time keeping up with the celestial chariot.

02:24:49.069 --> 02:24:56.239
So are we. So are the governing body.

02:24:56.239 --> 02:24:59.239
We're not driving the chariot.

02:24:59.239 --> 02:25:05.239
Jehovah is driving the chariot and we're running just as fast as you are trying to keep up.

02:25:05.239 --> 02:25:09.239
So let's all do our best to keep up with it.

02:25:09.239 --> 02:25:17.239
And let us thank Jehovah for continuing to deal with us and for continuing to provide nourishing spiritual food.

02:25:17.239 --> 02:25:34.229
Well, we truly thank you for the explain for that outstanding discourse.

02:25:34.229 --> 02:25:39.229
Of course, now our appetites have been wedded for what's about to come.

02:25:39.229 --> 02:25:44.229
And I'm sure you have many questions in your mind about what will the next talks hold?

02:25:44.229 --> 02:25:47.229
Well, hold that thought.

02:25:47.229 --> 02:25:59.229
Because now it's time to give our attention to Brother Carlo Capano as he conducts our next new song, which is entitled, Grant Us Boldness.

02:25:59.229 --> 02:26:12.149
Brothers, we will follow the same procedure as brother explained did with the chorus.

02:26:12.149 --> 02:26:59.540
So we'll be quick to start. The chorus will perform the song in its entirety. Grant us boldness.

02:26:59.540 --> 02:29:29.610
Please take a look at the lyrics as we will demonstrate the first eight measures.

02:29:29.610 --> 02:29:36.940
Your turn.

02:29:36.940 --> 02:29:57.530
Two.

02:29:57.530 --> 02:30:59.299
Well done.

02:30:59.299 --> 02:31:33.940
17 through 24.

02:31:33.940 --> 02:31:42.260
Keep your energy, friend.

02:31:42.260 --> 02:32:02.750
Three.

02:32:02.750 --> 02:32:03.750
25 through 31.

02:32:03.750 --> 02:32:36.270
Take a good breath.

02:32:36.270 --> 02:33:06.020
Now we'll sing through the first verse.

02:33:06.020 --> 02:34:38.100
Please listen closely and study the lyrics to stretch your legs a bit and please stand.

02:34:38.100 --> 02:37:43.229
We will have an introduction.

02:37:43.229 --> 02:37:53.860
Before you sit down, we'll give you the opportunity to remain standing for just a little bit so we can go over some greetings and announcements.

02:37:53.860 --> 02:37:58.860
But just before we do, what do you think of this Watch Tower chorus? Isn't that amazing?

02:37:58.860 --> 02:38:16.549
So many brothers and sisters around the world are thinking about us today.

02:38:16.549 --> 02:38:26.549
The brothers in France wrote to us and said our branch committee and the France Bethel family asked to convey our warm love and best wishes to all those in attendance.

02:38:26.549 --> 02:38:39.549
From Haiti, they tell us we are pleased to announce that this past August a new all-time peak of 20,180 publishers were active in the ministry in our fertile field.

02:38:39.549 --> 02:38:49.549
And from Madagascar, they mentioned that they achieved a 6% increase this year with 30,000 publishers. Wonderful.

02:38:49.549 --> 02:38:58.549
In other than say, the month of August brought the 2014 service year to a glorious end with activity without precedent, how true.

02:38:58.549 --> 02:39:01.549
And then we had this from Russia.

02:39:01.549 --> 02:39:08.549
The Russia Bethel family is happy to convey our warmest Christian love and greetings to all assembled.

02:39:08.549 --> 02:39:17.549
During the 2014 service year, we had a new peak of publishers, 171,268.

02:39:17.549 --> 02:39:26.549
But there is still potential for further growth because 292,058 attended the memorial.

02:39:26.549 --> 02:39:35.549
We rejoice being under the leadership of the heavenly King Jesus Christ and seeing how the words of Isaiah 54,17 are true.

02:39:35.549 --> 02:39:40.549
No weapon formed against you will have any success.

02:39:40.549 --> 02:39:48.549
We are convinced that the new service year will have new challenges but also new victories.

02:39:48.549 --> 02:39:53.549
Well, finally, from Central America, Branch, we had this nice greeting.

02:39:53.549 --> 02:40:06.549
They say Jehovah has been good to us as promised at Psalm 34,8 and in August 1,7,322 shared in the special campaign.

02:40:06.549 --> 02:40:15.549
They close by saying, please accept our love and prayers as you enjoy this special historic occasion. Beautiful greetings.

02:40:15.549 --> 02:40:30.969
Well, now here's one announcement we'd like to make.

02:40:30.969 --> 02:40:36.969
Each of us has an opportunity to share in the joy of making voluntary offerings.

02:40:36.969 --> 02:40:43.969
Contribution boxes are located throughout the facility for those who would like to give financial support to the worldwide work.

02:40:43.969 --> 02:40:48.969
In addition, donations can be made by debit or credit card.

02:40:48.969 --> 02:40:56.969
Please note that all contributions to the worldwide work of Jehovah's Witnesses are cared for by the local branch office.

02:40:56.969 --> 02:41:05.969
Therefore, it would be appreciated if those who contribute by check would simply make their checks payable to Jehovah's Witnesses.

02:41:05.969 --> 02:41:15.680
You may be seated.

02:41:15.680 --> 02:41:24.680
Well, now that the brothers explain so beautifully wedded our appetites for the things to come, we are eager to go on with our scriptural talks.

02:41:24.680 --> 02:41:30.680
And brother let of the governing body is now going to speak to us on the subject.

02:41:30.680 --> 02:41:33.680
Will you keep on the watch?

02:41:33.680 --> 02:41:49.620
Thousands and thousands of people die every year on the highway as a direct result of drivers going to sleep at the wheel.

02:41:49.620 --> 02:41:51.620
But now think about this.

02:41:51.620 --> 02:41:56.620
Going to sleep spiritually, of course, is much more serious.

02:41:56.620 --> 02:42:03.620
If one of Jehovah's servants is driving, goes to sleep, runs off the road, kills himself.

02:42:03.620 --> 02:42:08.620
It doesn't necessarily rule out he is being resurrected to everlasting life in the new world.

02:42:08.620 --> 02:42:21.620
But if one of God's servants goes to sleep spiritually, and the end of this system catches him in that condition, he will be gone for all eternity.

02:42:21.620 --> 02:42:30.620
No wonder there is so much exhortation, admonition, and God's word for us to stay awake spiritually.

02:42:30.620 --> 02:42:33.620
Expression such as, prove yourselves ready.

02:42:33.620 --> 02:42:35.620
Keep on the watch.

02:42:35.620 --> 02:42:36.620
Keep ready.

02:42:36.620 --> 02:42:37.620
Stay awake.

02:42:37.620 --> 02:42:45.620
Keep looking, and similar variations are distributed throughout God's word, especially in the Christian Greek Scriptures.

02:42:45.620 --> 02:42:57.620
And in harmony with this admonition, as you know, several of Jesus' parables are illustrations that manage us to keep on the watch.

02:42:57.620 --> 02:43:07.620
Now, one of these parables we're going to focus on in this talk is the one about the ten virgins mentioned in Matthew chapter 25.

02:43:07.620 --> 02:43:09.620
So please turn there.

02:43:09.620 --> 02:43:15.620
Matthew chapter 25, and put your marker here, because throughout this talk we'll be discussing this parable.

02:43:15.620 --> 02:43:22.620
Matthew 25, it's found in verses 1 through 13, so let's read it together.

02:43:22.620 --> 02:43:33.620
It says, then the kingdom of the heavens may be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.

02:43:33.620 --> 02:43:36.620
Five of them were foolish, and five were discreet.

02:43:36.620 --> 02:43:41.620
For the foolish took their lamps, but took no oil with them.

02:43:41.620 --> 02:43:46.620
Whereas the discreet took oil in their flask along with their lamps.

02:43:46.620 --> 02:43:52.620
While the bridegroom was delaying, they all became drowsy and fell asleep.

02:43:52.620 --> 02:44:00.620
Right in the middle of the night there was a shout, here is the bridegroom, go out to median.

02:44:00.620 --> 02:44:05.620
Then all those virgins got up and put their lamps in order.

02:44:05.620 --> 02:44:13.620
The foolish said to the discreet, give us some of your oil because our lamps are about to go out.

02:44:13.620 --> 02:44:24.620
The discreet answered, saying, perhaps there may not be enough for both us and you, go instead to those who sell it and buy some for yourselves.

02:44:24.620 --> 02:44:29.620
While they were going off to buy it, the bridegroom came.

02:44:29.620 --> 02:44:36.620
The virgins who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast and the door was shut.

02:44:36.620 --> 02:44:43.620
Afterward the rest of the virgins also came saying, sir, sir, open to us.

02:44:43.620 --> 02:44:51.620
In answer he said, I tell you the truth, I do not know you.

02:44:51.620 --> 02:44:58.620
Keep on the watch, therefore, because you know neither the day nor the hour.

02:44:58.620 --> 02:45:02.620
Now this is certainly a powerful parable indeed.

02:45:02.620 --> 02:45:09.620
But there are three questions we want to focus on in our discussion concerning this parable.

02:45:09.620 --> 02:45:13.620
Number one, what is the parable's basic message?

02:45:13.620 --> 02:45:21.620
Number two, how to fateful anointed ones apply the parable's counsel and with what results?

02:45:21.620 --> 02:45:27.620
And number three, how can each of us benefit from this parable today?

02:45:27.620 --> 02:45:33.620
Now let's take that first question, what is the basic message of this parable?

02:45:33.620 --> 02:45:51.620
Before we delve into answering that question, we'd like to just talk briefly about how in recent years we've received adjusted explanations concerning some of Jesus' parables or illustrations.

02:45:51.620 --> 02:46:04.620
The fateful slave has come to realize there's no need to try to assign meaning to the numerous details in many of these parables or illustrations.

02:46:04.620 --> 02:46:17.620
Now what has been the result of this? Well as resulted in explanations that are simpler, clearer, easier to understand and you could say even more powerful.

02:46:17.620 --> 02:46:31.620
To help us better understand the fateful slave's way of prayerfully looking at some of these illustrations, let's take just quickly the illustration in Luke chapter 11 verses 5 through 12.

02:46:31.620 --> 02:46:44.620
Now remember, that was about the man who boldly persisted in trying to borrow loaves from a neighbor and he did that at midnight.

02:46:44.620 --> 02:46:59.620
Now the fateful slave has come to appreciate there's no need to try to assign meaning to all these details in this parable for example, who is represented by the neighbor that he went to borrow the loaves from?

02:46:59.620 --> 02:47:06.620
Or what about the fact that he wanted to borrow not one, not two, three loaves? What's the significance of that?

02:47:06.620 --> 02:47:16.620
Or what about the fact that he went at midnight? He didn't go at six o'clock, nine o'clock, eleven o'clock midnight. Now what's the significance of that?

02:47:16.620 --> 02:47:28.620
Or what about the friend who was visiting you wanted to feed? Who's represented by this friend? Or what about the children of the neighbor? Or what about the fact the doors were already locked?

02:47:28.620 --> 02:47:38.620
Well, if we try to micro-analyze the parable in this way, now what would happen? What do you think would happen?

02:47:38.620 --> 02:47:49.620
Would we not end up distracted away from the simple parable lesson that Jesus was trying to convey? The lesson is very simple isn't it?

02:47:49.620 --> 02:47:59.620
Jesus was conveying the thought that if we go to Jehovah in prayer and ask for Holy Spirit, then he's more than willing to grant our request.

02:47:59.620 --> 02:48:08.620
And he's never going to say to us, even if we go again and again, he's never going to say quit making me trouble. The door is already locked.

02:48:09.620 --> 02:48:20.620
Well, with this better understanding of our way of looking at these parables, these illustrations, let's go back to the parable at hand, the one about the ten virgins.

02:48:20.620 --> 02:48:25.620
And let's go to that question, what is the parable's basic meaning?

02:48:25.620 --> 02:48:37.620
Well, in the past, our literature, as you know, has a sign specific prophetic meaning to many of the details in this parable, for example, the lamps.

02:48:37.620 --> 02:48:50.620
The oil, the flasks, previously the receptacles, the ones to whom the foolish virgins went to try to buy oil, et cetera, et cetera.

02:48:50.620 --> 02:49:01.620
But in doing so, have we allowed the spotlight, perhaps, to drift from the powerful, simple message that Jesus was trying to convey?

02:49:01.620 --> 02:49:06.620
Would Jehovah's help? Let's try to put the spotlight where it should be.

02:49:06.620 --> 02:49:15.620
And even though we're not going to confuse you with a lot of information about what we used to believe concerning this parable,

02:49:15.620 --> 02:49:22.620
we would like to say that what we're going to present now is a huge adjustment in our understanding of this parable.

02:49:22.620 --> 02:49:30.620
To help us discern the parable's basic message, let us first identify the two main characters.

02:49:30.620 --> 02:49:35.620
Number one, who is the bridegroom in our parable?

02:49:35.620 --> 02:49:42.620
Well, you might recall, in a different occasion, Jesus referred to Himself as the bridegroom.

02:49:42.620 --> 02:49:50.620
In Luke chapter 5, the Pharisees approached and they said, why is it your disciples don't fast?

02:49:50.620 --> 02:49:55.620
John's disciples fast? Are disciples fast? Your disciples eat and drink?

02:49:55.620 --> 02:50:02.620
Well, Jesus explained, when the bridegroom is with the friends of the bridegroom, why should they fast?

02:50:03.620 --> 02:50:07.620
When the bridegroom is taken away, then they will fast.

02:50:07.620 --> 02:50:12.620
Well, clearly, He was talking about how He was with them, but later He would be taken away.

02:50:12.620 --> 02:50:20.620
So unmistakably, in our parable, Jesus is the bridegroom mentioned here.

02:50:20.620 --> 02:50:29.620
So what about the virgins? Likely, you recall that both the Apostle Paul and the Apostle John under inspiration

02:50:29.620 --> 02:50:39.620
wrote about how that Christ's anointed followers could be likened to chaste virgins.

02:50:39.620 --> 02:50:47.620
2 Corinthians 112, the Apostle Paul did this. Revelation 144, where it talks about the 144,000,

02:50:47.620 --> 02:50:53.620
it talks about there how they are virgins unmistakably.

02:50:53.620 --> 02:50:59.620
The parable, when it talks about the 10 virgins, is talking about Christ anointed followers.

02:50:59.620 --> 02:51:09.620
And obviously, this parable was meant to counsel warning to Christ anointed followers that they had better keep on the watch.

02:51:09.620 --> 02:51:13.620
But now, what about the time frame of our parable?

02:51:13.620 --> 02:51:22.620
Well, near the end of the parable, verse 10, Jesus gives a clear indication concerning the time frame.

02:51:22.620 --> 02:51:27.620
It says in verse 10, the bridegroom came.

02:51:27.620 --> 02:51:35.620
Now, obviously, this refers to the time during the great tribulation when Jesus will come to carry out judgment work

02:51:35.620 --> 02:51:39.620
and destroy this wicked system of things.

02:51:39.620 --> 02:51:49.620
But now, the parable, therefore, must apply during the last days with this climax coming during the great tribulation.

02:51:49.620 --> 02:51:53.620
But what about the time frame of the parable?

02:51:53.620 --> 02:52:03.620
Well, that time indicator indicates that the real climax is certainly going to come during the great tribulation.

02:52:03.620 --> 02:52:08.620
But now, we ask this again, what is the basic message of this parable?

02:52:08.620 --> 02:52:10.620
Well, think of the context.

02:52:10.620 --> 02:52:16.620
What had Jesus discussed in the previous seven verses, right before this parable?

02:52:16.620 --> 02:52:19.620
Well, he talked about the faithful and discreet slave, didn't he?

02:52:19.620 --> 02:52:21.620
And he warned that slave.

02:52:21.620 --> 02:52:23.620
You better not become an evil slave.

02:52:23.620 --> 02:52:27.620
But now, what does he do in the verses that follow this parable we're discussing?

02:52:27.620 --> 02:52:35.620
He broadens his focus to warn all anointed ones that they had better keep on the watch.

02:52:35.620 --> 02:52:39.620
So that they're ready when the bridegroom arrives.

02:52:39.620 --> 02:52:44.620
So what's interesting is that at the end of Matthew 24, the faithful slave is warned.

02:52:44.620 --> 02:52:47.620
Beginning of Matthew 25, all the anointed are warned.

02:52:47.620 --> 02:52:50.620
We take it to the end of Matthew 25.

02:52:50.620 --> 02:52:57.620
We find there's an implied warning to the other sheep as to how they can be judged sheep rather than goats.

02:52:57.620 --> 02:53:00.620
So Jehovah leaves no one out, does he?

02:53:00.620 --> 02:53:04.620
He wants all his disciples to gain everlasting life.

02:53:04.620 --> 02:53:08.620
See, all the followers of Jesus, he doesn't want them to miss out.

02:53:08.620 --> 02:53:15.620
And if we do miss out, which is a terrible thought, we could never blame Jehovah, could we?

02:53:15.620 --> 02:53:18.620
But now, let's go to that second question, please.

02:53:18.620 --> 02:53:26.620
How do faithful anointed ones apply the parable's counsel and with what results?

02:53:26.620 --> 02:53:31.620
Well, theocratic history testifies that throughout the last days,

02:53:31.620 --> 02:53:39.620
faithful anointed Christians have exerted themselves vigorously to be just like those five discrete virgins.

02:53:39.620 --> 02:53:42.620
Remember, they truly prepared themselves, didn't they?

02:53:42.620 --> 02:53:49.620
To endure to the end, bringing extra oil along with their lamps.

02:53:49.620 --> 02:53:54.620
Well, similarly, faithful anointed ones have counted the cost of faithful service.

02:53:54.620 --> 02:54:01.620
They have realized from the outset that their assignment would mean giving up many of the material advantages of Satan's world.

02:54:01.620 --> 02:54:04.620
They maintain their integrity.

02:54:04.620 --> 02:54:11.620
They refuse to adopt the spirit of this wicked world and its unrighteous ways, and they continue shining.

02:54:11.620 --> 02:54:19.620
As illuminators, despite maybe a seeming delay in the arrival of the bridegroom.

02:54:19.620 --> 02:54:23.620
But they're undone it because they're not serving for a date.

02:54:23.620 --> 02:54:26.620
They're not serving with a deadline in mind.

02:54:26.620 --> 02:54:32.620
They loved Jehovah, and their determined to serve him for all eternity.

02:54:32.620 --> 02:54:42.620
But what is mentioned in verse 5 by the fact that all the virgins got drowsy and went to sleep at least for a while?

02:54:42.620 --> 02:54:52.620
Well, it constitutes a warning to all the anointed that spiritual drowsiness is a real danger.

02:54:52.620 --> 02:54:56.620
It's not just an imagined, it's a real danger throughout the last days.

02:54:56.620 --> 02:55:03.620
And it could happen to any, but the warning is don't be like these ones that went to sleep.

02:55:03.620 --> 02:55:08.620
Or if you do go to sleep momentarily, then wake up.

02:55:08.620 --> 02:55:15.620
See, just like the disciples in the garden of Guessimini, the weak flash, they went to sleep, but they woke up.

02:55:15.620 --> 02:55:23.620
Well, likewise, wake up, learn from your mistake, henceforth remain prepared, ready, and vigilant.

02:55:23.620 --> 02:55:26.620
Yes, that warning comes through loud and clear.

02:55:26.620 --> 02:55:29.620
But now consider this interesting point.

02:55:29.620 --> 02:55:41.620
There is a distinct interval between the shout, here is the bridegroom, verse 6, and the actual arrival of the bridegroom mentioned in verse 10.

02:55:41.620 --> 02:55:48.620
Well, in like manner, there's a distinct interval between Jesus' presence.

02:55:48.620 --> 02:55:55.620
He's being here and his actual arrival during the great tribulation.

02:55:55.620 --> 02:56:00.620
The vigilant anointed ones, what if they discern, they've discerned that distinction between his presence,

02:56:00.620 --> 02:56:08.620
meaning in 1914 and his actual arrival, which takes place during the great tribulation.

02:56:08.620 --> 02:56:14.620
And they know that the challenge is to endure until his arrival.

02:56:14.620 --> 02:56:21.620
And that now of all times is certainly no time to go to sleep spiritually.

02:56:21.620 --> 02:56:33.620
However, perhaps the most puzzling part of the parable is the verbal exchange between the discreet and the foolish virgins, which takes place near the end of the parable.

02:56:33.620 --> 02:56:39.620
Let's read this again. Matthew 25, please, let's read verses 8 and 9.

02:56:39.620 --> 02:56:49.940
It says, the foolish said to the discreet, give us some of your oil, because our lamps are about to go out.

02:56:49.940 --> 02:57:04.940
The discreet answered saying, perhaps there may not be enough both for us and you go instead to those who sell it and buy some for yourselves.

02:57:04.940 --> 02:57:12.940
Now, this same strange, doesn't it? When in history have God's people refused to help someone who asked for help?

02:57:13.940 --> 02:57:22.940
Well, the answer to that seemingly puzzling question presents itself if we think about the time frame again.

02:57:22.940 --> 02:57:31.940
When does this verbal exchange take place? Well, it must take place during the great tribulation.

02:57:31.940 --> 02:57:38.940
Just before the bridegroom comes near the end of the great tribulation, that must be when this verbal exchange takes place.

02:57:39.940 --> 02:57:46.940
But now let's back up a little bit in the stream of time before that. What has happened before the great tribulation begins?

02:57:46.940 --> 02:58:06.940
Well, all the anointed have received their final ceiling. We're familiar with Revelation 7 verses 1 through 4, the four angels holding back the four winds of the great tribulation, and they hold them back how long, until all the anointed are finally sealed.

02:58:06.940 --> 02:58:18.940
In the forehead, and then the great tribulation begins. So before the great tribulation, that final ceiling has taken place. After that, their calling is sure.

02:58:18.940 --> 02:58:27.940
But now, what about any anointed ones who failed to remain watchful during the years before the great tribulation? They would lose their heavenly calling.

02:58:27.940 --> 02:58:39.940
They would not receive that final ceiling before the great tribulation begins. And they might be shocked when the great tribulation begins.

02:58:39.940 --> 02:58:53.940
Because here they've been replaced because the number 144,000 has to be complete. So they would be perhaps shocked at this point realizing they had not received that final ceiling.

02:58:53.940 --> 02:59:06.940
And at that late hour, if in desperation they asked for help, what would happen? Well, Jesus Parable gives the grim answer, doesn't it? It simply would be too late.

02:59:06.940 --> 02:59:13.940
See, none of the faithful anointed could do anything to help those who have proved unfaithful during the great tribulation.

02:59:13.940 --> 02:59:22.940
Anymore, then Noah could help once outside the ark once Jehovah closed the door and the flood began.

02:59:22.940 --> 02:59:36.940
But now, ponder this. Since in the parable, five of the virgins are described as acting foolish. Does that mean that half of those claiming to be of anointed during the last days will prove unfaithful?

02:59:36.940 --> 02:59:49.940
Will lose their reward? No. Remember, Jesus had just warned in the previous seven verses the fateful and discreet slave that he better not become an evil slave.

02:59:49.940 --> 03:00:00.940
Did Jesus expect that outcome to take place? No. Our publications have pointed out it was a hypothetical situation saying, now, if you would prove to be this way, this is what would happen to you.

03:00:00.940 --> 03:00:14.940
Well, similarly, this parable conveys a powerful warning to all the anointed. See, if you become like those five foolish, this would be the grim outcome for you.

03:00:14.940 --> 03:00:27.940
But think of this. Just as five of the virgins were foolish, five are described as being discreet. That certainly gives us the idea that each one of the anointed has full capacity.

03:00:27.940 --> 03:00:40.940
In fact, you could say equal capacity to choose vigilance, fatefulness, or folly unfaithfulness. That makes us think of Deuteronomy 30. Let's go there.

03:00:40.940 --> 03:00:50.940
Deuteronomy 30. And you remember the words of Jehovah through Moses to the Israelites and it certainly applies to all the anointed. In fact, all of God's people.

03:00:50.940 --> 03:01:05.940
But I notice Deuteronomy 30 verse 19, Jehovah says, I take the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you today that I have put life and death before you.

03:01:05.940 --> 03:01:15.940
The blessing and the curse. And you must choose life so that you may live you and your descendants.

03:01:15.940 --> 03:01:24.940
So notice the thought there. The choice is set before all as to what they choose. There are many things we can't choose.

03:01:24.940 --> 03:01:29.940
For example, before you're born, you couldn't choose your relatives. Could you?

03:01:29.940 --> 03:01:36.940
We couldn't choose our face. Many of us would have made a different choice. We had a choice.

03:01:37.940 --> 03:01:45.940
When it comes to the most important thing in the universe, will we serve Jehovah or not? We can choose.

03:01:45.940 --> 03:01:57.940
And of course, when we make the right choice, it makes Jehovah's heart glad. But why does it say there in verse 19, Jehovah saying, you must choose life.

03:01:57.940 --> 03:02:06.940
That seems kind of contradictory, didn't it? You must choose. When you were very young, when did your parents ever say to you, you must choose to clean up your room?

03:02:06.940 --> 03:02:16.940
You have to think about that one. They didn't give you a choice, didn't it? But it really is not a mistaken rendering. It reflects Jehovah's thinking.

03:02:16.940 --> 03:02:26.940
See, he gives us the choice. But he really hopes he's urging us. You must choose if you want life. And I hope that you make this choice.

03:02:26.940 --> 03:02:37.940
Jehovah and Jesus know that all of the anointed can choose to remain faithful. And they can receive the thrilling reward and what a thrilling reward it is if you think about it.

03:02:37.940 --> 03:02:46.940
Think of immortality, incorruption, being empowered to truly be able to help humans and thus experience the greater gift of giving.

03:02:46.940 --> 03:02:52.940
Think about direct association with Jehovah and Jesus in the heavens, what a thrilling reward it is.

03:02:52.940 --> 03:03:02.940
But now a third question, and we'll just take a moment on this, how can each of us benefit from Jesus parable today?

03:03:02.940 --> 03:03:12.940
In view of what we've discussed, should we conclude that this parable about the 10 virgins is only for the benefit of the anointed?

03:03:12.940 --> 03:03:20.940
There's no benefit for Christ other sheep? Far from it. Remember, the message of the parable is simple.

03:03:20.940 --> 03:03:32.940
It is summed up in the final verse, verse 13, where Jesus said, keep on the watch. Do you think Jehovah and Jesus would give that admonition only to the anointed? Certainly not.

03:03:32.940 --> 03:03:41.940
If I go to Mark 13, please, Mark chapter 13, and let's read verse 37, notice what Jesus said to his disciples?

03:03:41.940 --> 03:03:57.940
Verse 37, he said, but what I say to you, to his disciples who later became anointed ones, what I say to you, I say to all, keep on the watch.

03:03:57.940 --> 03:04:06.940
So clearly, Jehovah and Jesus expect all, no matter what they're hope, to meet the same standard of watchfulness.

03:04:06.940 --> 03:04:16.940
And we know we don't have two Bibles, do we? We don't have one Bible for the anointed one for the other sheep, we have one Bible, but this one Bible we have works very good, doesn't it?

03:04:16.940 --> 03:04:30.940
We're helping all of us to keep on the watch. And it's good to recall, too, that in the parable, the foolish virgins asked the discreet for some of their oil, but it was a vain request, wasn't it?

03:04:30.940 --> 03:04:41.940
Well, that reminds us that no one can be faithful for us, no one can stand the truth for us, no one can keep on the watch for us. We have to do it personally.

03:04:41.940 --> 03:04:54.940
So we say we ask to all faithful anointed ones, and we ask to all precious other sheep, will you keep on the watch? Well, we know you're determined to do so.

03:04:54.940 --> 03:05:10.940
That's why you're here at this meeting. And if we do our part, Jehovah, certainly going to do his, and we're going to be successful, see, yes, it's vital that we stay awake, keep on the watch, and it's more vital now than ever before.

03:05:10.940 --> 03:05:19.940
And why is that? Because all the evidence corroborates, that the bridegroom is coming very soon.

03:05:19.940 --> 03:05:49.590
Well, we thank you very much for the let that was outstanding. Well now, Brother Anthony Morris of the governing body is going to keep the momentum going, as he speaks to us now on the topic, the parable of the talents.

03:05:49.590 --> 03:06:14.100
Jesus was a master when it came to illustrations, parables, and what was precious, precious, I should say about Jesus, he taught in such a clear and simple way.

03:06:15.100 --> 03:06:30.100
That's what we should all those that teach in the congregation endeavor to achieve. So you won't hear me saying any Greek words during this talk. It's got to be clear, got to be simple.

03:06:30.100 --> 03:06:45.100
So let's look at that illustration, Matthew chapter 25, and Brother let help us appreciate the context here has to do with the disciples keeping on the watch.

03:06:45.100 --> 03:06:59.100
Now in the illustration that we're going to read here about the talents, the master is Jesus, and it's important to understand, he talks about this traveling abroad.

03:06:59.100 --> 03:07:10.100
So the disciples at the time are thinking the kingdom's coming instantly, said no, he travels abroad, there's going to be considerable time involved.

03:07:10.100 --> 03:07:25.100
Now here's the lesson that will help us all by extension the other sheep keep on the watch. Let's read it in its entirety, verses 14 through 30, Matthew 25.

03:07:25.100 --> 03:07:40.100
For it is just like a man about to travel abroad who summoned his slaves and entrusted his belongings to them, he gave five talents to one to another and one to still another to each according to his own ability and he went abroad.

03:07:40.100 --> 03:07:51.100
Immediately the one who received the five talents went and did business with them and gained five more. Likewise the one who received the two gained two more.

03:07:51.100 --> 03:08:05.100
But the slave who received just one went off and dug in the ground and hid his master's money. After a long time the master those slaves came and settled accounts with them.

03:08:05.100 --> 03:08:17.100
So the one who had received the five talents came forward and brought five additional talents saying master you entrusted five talents to me see I gained five talents more.

03:08:17.100 --> 03:08:30.100
As master said to him well done good and faithful slave you were faithful over a few things I will appoint you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.

03:08:30.100 --> 03:08:40.100
Finally the slave who had received the one talent came forward and said master you entrusted two talents to me see I gained two talents more.

03:08:40.100 --> 03:08:52.100
As master said to him well done good and faithful slave you were faithful over a few things I will appoint you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.

03:08:52.100 --> 03:09:04.100
Finally the slave who had received the one talent came forward and said master I knew you to be a demanding man reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you did not win him.

03:09:04.100 --> 03:09:21.100
So I grew afraid and went and hid your talent in the ground here you have what is yours. In reply his master said to him wicked and sluggish slave you knew did you that I reap where I did not sow and gathered where I did not win him.

03:09:21.100 --> 03:09:29.100
Well then you should have deposited my money with the bankers and I am my coming I would have received it back with interest.

03:09:29.100 --> 03:09:48.100
Therefore take the talent away from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents for everyone who has more will be given and he will have an abundance but the one who does not have even what he has will be taken away from him and throw the good for nothing slave out into the darkness outside.

03:09:48.100 --> 03:10:04.100
There is where his weeping and the gnashing of his teeth will be. So this is the illustration of the talents we have five key questions that will be addressing in this talk.

03:10:04.100 --> 03:10:14.100
Two of them are adjusted understanding so pay attention and the first question what do the talents represent will establish that.

03:10:14.100 --> 03:10:24.100
Second how have the talents been used. Third when does the master come to settle accounts with his slaves this is adjusted.

03:10:24.100 --> 03:10:35.100
Fourth who does the wicked and sluggish slave represent this is adjusted understanding and then the fifth one what two lessons do we learn from this illustration.

03:10:35.100 --> 03:10:46.100
Now I thought I would just quote our new kingdom book at this point and brother explain helped us to understand sometimes we will have cherished teachings.

03:10:46.100 --> 03:11:01.100
We have been saying it for decades and we trust the brothers that printed it decades ago and that is fine but when it is time then we need to adjust our thinking if the teachings being adjusted.

03:11:01.100 --> 03:11:21.850
It is not complicated. And we all just treasure our new kingdom book there is so many wise things in their illustrations artwork you can't find anyplace else than Bethel and now they are in a book.

03:11:21.850 --> 03:11:34.850
So here is what we said on page 37 paragraph 18 and you will see how it applies to this which you just heard with brother let and you will hear here and you are going to hear with the Jackson by the way.

03:11:34.850 --> 03:11:45.850
Just as Jehovah progressively revealed truth about the kingdom in the period leading up to 1914 he continues to do so during the time of the end.

03:11:45.850 --> 03:11:59.850
God's people have had to adjust their understanding on a number of occasions does the fact that fact mean that they do not have Jehovah's backing on the contrary he supports them.

03:11:59.850 --> 03:12:08.850
Why? Because those who fear Jehovah have displayed two qualities that he loves faith and humility.

03:12:08.850 --> 03:12:22.850
Jehovah's servants have faith that all the promises and God's word will come true. They show humility when they admit that they misunderstood exactly how those promises would be fulfilled or the teachings.

03:12:23.850 --> 03:12:45.850
That humble attitude is reflected in the March 1st 1925 issue of the watch tower and this is profound back 1925 quote we know that the Lord is his own interpreter that he will interpret his word to his people in his own good way and in his own due time.

03:12:45.850 --> 03:12:56.850
Jehovah's running this organization he's the rider of the chariot and we're pleased to follow the best we can and keep up with it.

03:12:56.850 --> 03:13:11.850
So what are the talents represent well we had eight talents there that's a huge fortune if you're dealing with the denari they'd earn about a denarius a day so it takes 6,000 denari to earn just one talent.

03:13:11.850 --> 03:13:18.850
So an average worker back at that time would have to work 20 years to accumulate that kind of money.

03:13:18.850 --> 03:13:26.850
So before traveling abroad Jesus distributed the talents here and he expected them to do business.

03:13:27.850 --> 03:13:41.850
It's all you business men out there business women you know if you run a business you expect business to be done so Jesus is borrowing that mentality toward the work he had for his disciples.

03:13:41.850 --> 03:13:52.850
So just like this man Jesus had something of great value before he ascended to heaven and he attached great importance to the preaching work and teaching work.

03:13:52.850 --> 03:14:04.850
And while on the earth he cultivated that rich field there the potential and he told his disciples you'll recall lift your eyes and view the fields they're white for harvesting.

03:14:04.850 --> 03:14:15.850
And shortly after his resurrection and before he ascended those monumentally important words go therefore to make disciples.

03:14:16.850 --> 03:14:35.850
So committing his belongings to his disciples simply put the talents referred to the responsibility that we have to preach and teach to make disciples it's very simple that's the talent preach and make disciples.

03:14:35.850 --> 03:14:55.850
How have the talents been used well he gave five to one two to the other one to the other one and he expected them to do business and in the first century they really applied the illustration because where he says in verse 16 immediately the one that received the five talents went and did business.

03:14:55.850 --> 03:15:23.850
Well the book of Acts makes it very clear those first century Christians did just so they immediately went about doing the king's business and making increase now during the time after the apostles died there's we know Satan fermented the apostasy and so really while the first century they had some activity there we can relate to.

03:15:23.850 --> 03:15:42.850
There are no sustained efforts during all those centuries where anybody was trying to fulfill the commission to preach and make disciples get a little glimmers of things happening so during that time the weeds were just overrunning all of the wheat that was available.

03:15:42.850 --> 03:16:14.780
Well then we come to the harvest time in particular we're talking about 1919 and the faithful anointed slaves on earth have been doing business during these last days the anointed brothers and I might add anointed sisters have done their best so who has the five talents and who represents those having the two talents.

03:16:14.780 --> 03:16:28.159
Thank you for not raising your hand the hosts in the audience here because there's no need to speculate about that okay so stop it if you've been speculating.

03:16:28.159 --> 03:16:45.159
All it's got to be the governing body no then say that all the Jesus is trying to get across they're going to do their best some get the workload of five others are doing two they doubled their efforts that's all.

03:16:45.159 --> 03:17:07.159
Now what role do those with an earthly hope play oh boy very important role very important role his illustration of the sheep and the goats teaches us that those with the earthly hope have the honor of loyally supporting Christ brothers.

03:17:07.159 --> 03:17:24.600
I remember telling a friend of mine once where I wasn't treated too well in this particular branch territory and I said to my friend well it's not me they need to worry about it's my big brother that's where they better worry about.

03:17:25.600 --> 03:17:55.520
Yeah we got to pray for those men over there so during these last days the two groups that work together is one flock zealously carrying out the work and I just want to take make an opportunity here I don't see if there's a clock okay so just to take the opportunity when we think about what happened this past August and we're getting some reports in and you'll have more than you talk about a loud shout.

03:17:55.520 --> 03:18:20.520
A loud shout of praise and most were other sheep out there it's just phenomenal that historic month what happened and don't have time to go into some of these early reports already but just astounding it's just in raging the devil the amazing support that was given to August the last day of the service month a service year and all these pioneers helped.

03:18:20.520 --> 03:18:51.250
You know God loves them because usually in August they're taking it easy and I don't want to lose the opportunity to thank all the brothers and sisters that are coming here to help construct our soon to be headquarters in warwick and you help the wall kill and tuxedo all this construction you disrupted your lives and you temporary workers that are coming in six months a year they're about see that's part of the preachers.

03:18:52.250 --> 03:19:06.250
We're working brother guy Pierce was always fun of telling young Bethelites you'd have to be in the circuit work to support more publishers and at a young age you're supporting hundreds of publishers by working at Bethel.

03:19:06.250 --> 03:19:20.250
So your sacred service in these construction projects that's all part of it supporting Christ the brothers in the gardening body notices you from our rooms there in Brooklyn anyway we hours of the morning

03:19:20.250 --> 03:19:52.010
head now to the buses coming back in with the high viz equipment on for safety factors of construction come in late tired but everybody's happy and we just want to commend you for your self-sacrificing spirit.

03:19:52.010 --> 03:20:01.379
The third question when does the master come to settle accounts this is adjusted as well.

03:20:01.379 --> 03:20:17.379
In the past here's what we've said Jesus settled accounts with the slaves in 1919 but when we reexamine the illustration in the context it's very clear to us that we needed to adjust our understanding.

03:20:17.379 --> 03:20:34.379
His coming to settle accounts can take place during the great chivalry just like the virgins the brother let spoke about in his part so what leads us to this conclusion now I know this is probably most spiritually astute audience that you'll speak before.

03:20:34.379 --> 03:20:47.379
People brothers and sisters from all over the world maybe you notice this maybe a hadn't some of you teaching the schools I'm sure have go back to chapter 24 so when we speak about.

03:20:47.379 --> 03:21:02.379
What leads us to this conclusion there in verse three he's sitting on the Mount of Olives they want to know when all this is going to happen as I said earlier they're thinking the kingdom's going to come instantly.

03:21:02.379 --> 03:21:24.379
So you notice verse four in answer so this is a teaching session in answer Jesus said to them and he starts teaching look see the quotation well if you follow this it goes all the way through chapter 24.

03:21:24.379 --> 03:21:53.379
He speaks about this faithful slave the evil slave now go over chapter 25 in the very first verse same teaching session this is not two weeks later same occasion he's teaching answering this question and he does this all the way to the end of that 25th chapter it's the context that leads us to the proper conclusion.

03:21:53.379 --> 03:22:18.379
In this prophecy of Matthew 24 and 25 he repeatedly mentions his coming and he's referring to the judgment during the great tribulation see the son of men coming on the clouds of heaven that's the great tribulation and he's urging his followers living in the last days to be vigilant you don't know the day or the hour in the Lord's coming.

03:22:18.379 --> 03:22:44.659
Coming at an hour that you that's the disciples do not think to be it. So Hanson you see verse 19 of Matthew 25 after a long time the master those slaves came that's he came and settled accounts during the great tribulation he's referring to that time who's going to execute judgment at the end of the system.

03:22:44.659 --> 03:23:13.659
So those represented by the first two slaves hard working anointed disciples as you know already received their final seal and before the great tribulation breaks out and then before I'm again they receive their heavenly reward and just prior to Armageddon those with the earthly hope of supported Christ's brothers loyalty in the preaching work will be judged as sheep and be granted the privilege of living in the earthly realm of the kingdom.

03:23:13.659 --> 03:23:40.659
Now here's the next adjusted understanding with question number four who does the wicked and sluggish slave represent now in the parable the last slave buried his talent he showed a bad spirit he deliberately worked against the master's interest the master was not harsh but properly pronounced him wicked and sluggish.

03:23:40.659 --> 03:24:03.909
Jehovah and Jesus do not tolerate sluggish when it comes to the worship of him and this disciple making word. Now in the past what we said was that the wicked slave pictured a class of anointed ones who in 1914 refused to preach however think about it.

03:24:03.909 --> 03:24:16.909
In this illustration and remember what brother let spoke about with the virgins was Jesus here for telling that a significant number of his anointed followers would prove to be wicked and sluggish.

03:24:16.909 --> 03:24:32.909
The context indicates otherwise now the illustration the faithful discrete slave he spoke about the evil slave that was simply to warn the faithful don't ever get like that.

03:24:32.909 --> 03:24:45.909
And then like brother let mentioned with the ten virgins just warning you don't keep on the watch you're going to lose your sense of vigilance you're not going to be ready you're a foolish virgin.

03:24:45.909 --> 03:25:01.540
So in the context it seems reasonable to conclude that in the illustration of the talents he was not fortelling a large number of his anointed brothers during the last days who would be wicked and sluggish.

03:25:01.540 --> 03:25:22.540
This is as we've said before there's no wicked slave class that has arisen in the last days. Now it's granted the fact is that some professed anointed did prove to be wicked and sluggish and refused to do business or that's a fact just like some other sheep refused to be faithful and loyal to Christ's brothers.

03:25:22.540 --> 03:25:36.540
Jesus's warning is anointed followers remain diligent and avoid the attitudes and actions of a wicked slave. So our fifth one what two lessons do we learn from this illustration?

03:25:36.540 --> 03:25:48.540
Well first the master Christ has entrusted his anointed slaves with something he views as precious the commission to preach and make disciples.

03:25:48.540 --> 03:26:17.479
I can assure you each and every one of the brothers on the governing body cherish this privilege. How about you? Do you cherish the privilege to preach and make disciples of Christ Jesus?

03:26:17.479 --> 03:26:34.479
Now the second one second lesson Christ expects all of us the anointed and the other sheep to be diligent in the preaching word. Now if we are we can be sure we're going to be rewarded for our faith or vigilance and loyalty.

03:26:34.479 --> 03:26:45.479
Indeed how eager we are to hear those words well done good and faithful slave enter into the joy of your master.

03:26:45.479 --> 03:27:16.110
Oh we truly thank you brother Morris for that outstanding discourse. Now we're going to just change topic a little bit. We're looking forward to hearing from brother Jeffrey Jackson of the governing body and his theme is in the form of an intriguing question.

03:27:16.110 --> 03:27:32.290
Who will soon attack God's people. I'm sure each one of us agrees that in recent times we've been excited with our adjusted understanding with regard to the great tribulation.

03:27:32.290 --> 03:27:46.290
In just the last few months we've had some very interesting articles in the watchtower that have helped us to realize that the anointed will not remain on earth after the battle of Armageddon.

03:27:46.290 --> 03:27:56.290
We've seen an explanation with regard to Matthew 24 verse 31 where it speaks about the final gathering of the chosen ones.

03:27:56.290 --> 03:28:08.290
Just a few months ago we had a very interesting article talking about Micah chapter 5 verse 5 and we understood there what the Assyrian invading our land represents.

03:28:08.290 --> 03:28:17.290
And we've certainly appreciated the adjusted understanding with regard to what Jesus coming really involves.

03:28:17.290 --> 03:28:26.290
And now to that list we can add what we've learnt today about the parable of the virgins and the parable of the talents.

03:28:26.290 --> 03:28:37.290
It seems that the closer we get to the outbreak of the great tribulation the finer our understanding is being tuned.

03:28:37.290 --> 03:28:48.290
And I'm sure we all agree that we appreciate that because obviously Jehovah wants us to prepare for the events that are just shortly ahead of us.

03:28:48.290 --> 03:29:05.290
We realize from studying the scriptures that soon after the outbreak of the great tribulation then as time goes on before the anointed are taken to heaven.

03:29:05.290 --> 03:29:20.290
There will be an attack on God's people now all of us are very very interested in the meaning of that because most of us will probably be involved with this attack coming to us.

03:29:20.290 --> 03:29:29.290
You know that immediately a thinking of Ezekiel chapter 38 and 39, Gog of May Gogh.

03:29:29.290 --> 03:29:34.290
But who really is Gog of May Gogh?

03:29:34.290 --> 03:29:42.489
Well we're running a little overtime so we thought we'll leave that for next year.

03:29:42.489 --> 03:29:48.729
I don't think they're going to let me walk off the platform.

03:29:48.729 --> 03:29:59.729
A number of years our publications have explained that Gog of May Gogh refers to Satan the devil particularly after his ouster from heaven.

03:29:59.729 --> 03:30:09.729
And we base that on an understanding of what Revelation tells us that Satan is the primary one who is interested in destroying God's people.

03:30:09.729 --> 03:30:13.729
For example Revelation chapter 12 highlights that.

03:30:13.729 --> 03:30:20.729
But it's interesting when we look at that explanation some questions come to mind.

03:30:20.729 --> 03:30:23.729
Would you like to look at some of those questions?

03:30:23.729 --> 03:30:27.729
Turn with me please to Ezekiel chapter 38.

03:30:27.729 --> 03:30:34.729
Excuse me please. This Bible is getting very heavy after this long program maybe.

03:30:34.729 --> 03:30:47.879
Maybe I'll use my backup electronic tablet.

03:30:47.879 --> 03:30:55.930
Ezekiel chapter 39 let's read that if no one comes out and takes me off the platform.

03:30:55.930 --> 03:30:58.930
Chapter 39 verse 4.

03:30:58.930 --> 03:31:05.930
On the mountains of Israel you will fall and all your troops and the peoples who will be with you.

03:31:05.930 --> 03:31:13.930
I will give you as food to all kinds of birds of prey and the wild beasts of the field.

03:31:13.930 --> 03:31:18.930
And if you look down to verse 11 what does that say?

03:31:18.930 --> 03:31:20.930
Again with regard to Gog of May Gogh.

03:31:20.930 --> 03:31:28.930
On that day I will give Gogh a burial place there in Israel in the valley of those who travel east of the sea.

03:31:28.930 --> 03:31:33.930
And then it goes on to talk about Gogh being buried.

03:31:33.930 --> 03:31:36.930
Now what questions arise?

03:31:36.930 --> 03:31:39.930
I'm sure you already starting to think about them.

03:31:39.930 --> 03:31:46.930
How could a spirit creature be eaten by the birds of heaven and the wild beasts?

03:31:46.930 --> 03:31:51.930
And how could Satan be buried here on earth?

03:31:51.930 --> 03:31:55.930
Well that does cause a problem doesn't it?

03:31:55.930 --> 03:32:02.930
In addition to that let's turn our Bibles to Revelation chapter 20 and verses 7 and 8.

03:32:02.930 --> 03:32:06.930
And this we could say raises a related question.

03:32:06.930 --> 03:32:09.930
So Revelation 20 verses 7 and 8.

03:32:09.930 --> 03:32:14.930
And here it speaks about the end of the thousand years and what occurs after that.

03:32:14.930 --> 03:32:20.930
Now as soon as the thousand years have ended Satan will be released from his prison

03:32:20.930 --> 03:32:28.930
and he will go out to mislead those nations in the four corners of the earth, Gogh and May Gogh.

03:32:28.930 --> 03:32:30.930
Well you know the rest of the verse.

03:32:30.930 --> 03:32:34.930
Now what question comes to mind?

03:32:34.930 --> 03:32:41.930
Well if Satan is Gogh how can he mislead Gogh and May Gogh?

03:32:41.930 --> 03:32:45.930
Well all of these are very good questions.

03:32:45.930 --> 03:32:47.930
So what does it help us to see?

03:32:47.930 --> 03:32:54.930
Clearly when we study Ezekiel 38 and 39 together with Revelation 20,

03:32:54.930 --> 03:33:01.930
we see that Gogh does not refer to the Spirit creature Satan the devil.

03:33:01.930 --> 03:33:05.930
Well who then is Gogh of May Gogh?

03:33:05.930 --> 03:33:09.930
To answer that question we need to look at the scriptures at a whole

03:33:09.930 --> 03:33:14.930
and to find out who really attacks God's people in the future.

03:33:14.930 --> 03:33:17.930
Now when we look at the scriptures what do we see?

03:33:17.930 --> 03:33:21.930
It doesn't only refer to the attack of Gogh of May Gogh

03:33:21.930 --> 03:33:26.930
but there's a reference to an attack from the King of the North.

03:33:26.930 --> 03:33:33.930
Also the scriptures tell us the kings of the nations will be involved with opposing God's people.

03:33:33.930 --> 03:33:36.930
The watchtower recently raised the question,

03:33:36.930 --> 03:33:40.930
are these all different attacks?

03:33:40.930 --> 03:33:46.930
Or perhaps do they highlight just one attack under different names?

03:33:46.930 --> 03:33:50.930
Well the watchtower made a comment, are they different attacks?

03:33:50.930 --> 03:33:53.930
The answer was not likely.

03:33:53.930 --> 03:34:01.930
It seems that the Bible is referring to this one attack under different names.

03:34:01.930 --> 03:34:03.930
Now why can we draw that conclusion?

03:34:03.930 --> 03:34:06.930
Well when we look at what the scriptures say,

03:34:06.930 --> 03:34:11.930
all the nations of the earth will be involved somehow in this attack on God's people.

03:34:11.930 --> 03:34:16.930
So when we look at the testimony here in the scriptures,

03:34:16.930 --> 03:34:24.930
we can see that it's evident that Gogh of May Gogh does not refer to Satan the devil

03:34:24.930 --> 03:34:29.930
but to a coalition of nations.

03:34:29.930 --> 03:34:31.930
Let me say that again.

03:34:31.930 --> 03:34:38.930
The name Gogh of May Gogh refers not to Satan but to a coalition of nations.

03:34:38.930 --> 03:34:41.930
Now I know what you're thinking.

03:34:41.930 --> 03:34:49.930
You're thinking, will this coalition be led by the figurative King of the North?

03:34:49.930 --> 03:34:52.930
We can't say for certain.

03:34:52.930 --> 03:34:59.930
But this thought does seem to be in harmony with what is revealed in the book of Ezekiel.

03:34:59.930 --> 03:35:04.930
Now let's look again, this time at Ezekiel chapter 38.

03:35:04.930 --> 03:35:07.930
We'll look at verse 6 and also verse 15.

03:35:07.930 --> 03:35:13.930
Now remember the question is somehow the attack by the King of the North associated with this.

03:35:13.930 --> 03:35:22.930
Verse 6 tells us notice that the troops come from the remotest parts of the North.

03:35:22.930 --> 03:35:27.930
Then if we look down to verse 15, what else does it tell us there?

03:35:27.930 --> 03:35:36.930
It speaks about you will come from your place and where is that place from the remotest parts of the North.

03:35:36.930 --> 03:35:44.930
Now while we're thinking about this similarity between the attack of Gogh of May Gogh and the attack by the King of the North,

03:35:44.930 --> 03:35:51.930
let's take our Bibles and turn to Daniel chapter 11 and remember Daniel was a contemporary of Ezekiel.

03:35:51.930 --> 03:35:59.930
In chapter 11 verses 44 and 45, the last two verses in Daniel chapter 11.

03:35:59.930 --> 03:36:03.930
Now what does this tell us about the King of the North?

03:36:03.930 --> 03:36:10.180
But reports out of the east and out of the North will disturb him.

03:36:10.180 --> 03:36:16.180
And he will go out in a great, great rage to annihilate and to devote many to destruction.

03:36:16.180 --> 03:36:22.180
And he will plant his royal tents between this grancy and the holy mountain of decoration.

03:36:22.180 --> 03:36:29.180
And he will come all the way to his end and there will be no helper for him.

03:36:29.180 --> 03:36:35.180
Well this sounds very similar, doesn't it, to what is described in Ezekiel chapter 38.

03:36:35.180 --> 03:36:42.180
But what happens next? Well you might be saying that's the end of chapter 11.

03:36:42.180 --> 03:36:48.180
Well remember back in ancient times there weren't chapters and verses, so let's read on.

03:36:48.180 --> 03:36:58.180
That makes sense, doesn't it? In chapter 12 and verse 1, during that time, now that was good we kept reading, wasn't it?

03:36:58.180 --> 03:37:02.180
I mean obviously there's some connection.

03:37:02.180 --> 03:37:11.180
During that time Michael, now we know Michael is another reference to how Lord Jesus Christ will stand up.

03:37:11.180 --> 03:37:15.180
And we understand that to mean during the great tribulation.

03:37:15.180 --> 03:37:21.180
The great prince who is standing in behalf of your people.

03:37:21.180 --> 03:37:30.180
And again we understand that Jesus is already standing since 1914, now for 100 years he is standing.

03:37:30.180 --> 03:37:34.180
And what does it say, he is standing in behalf of your people.

03:37:34.180 --> 03:37:40.180
And there will occur a time of distress. What time? The great tribulation.

03:37:40.180 --> 03:37:45.180
Such as not occurred since there came to be a nation until that time.

03:37:45.180 --> 03:37:53.180
And during that time your people will escape everyone who has found written down in the book.

03:37:53.180 --> 03:38:01.180
So do we see the parallels there? Even though we can't be dogmatic about it, we look forward to the future to see how it's all going to work out.

03:38:01.180 --> 03:38:10.180
But there certainly are some similarities there between the attack of Gog of May Gog and the attack of the king of the north.

03:38:10.180 --> 03:38:15.180
But what about that other scripture we referred to in Revelation 20 verse 8.

03:38:15.180 --> 03:38:21.180
About the end of the thousand years, the time when there is a Gog and May Gog.

03:38:21.180 --> 03:38:23.180
How do they fit into the picture?

03:38:23.180 --> 03:38:35.180
Well we could say the murderous rebels at the time of the great tribulation who want to attack God's people.

03:38:35.180 --> 03:38:45.180
They have a similar spirit manifested by those at the end of the thousand years who likewise wish to attack God's people.

03:38:45.180 --> 03:38:52.180
So that same murderous attitude that opposing rebellious attitude is similar.

03:38:52.180 --> 03:38:56.180
And the fate or the end of these ones is exactly the same isn't it.

03:38:56.180 --> 03:39:00.180
All these ones will experience everlasting death.

03:39:01.180 --> 03:39:06.180
Now I also know there's a question that you're thinking.

03:39:06.180 --> 03:39:14.459
Who is the king of the north?

03:39:14.459 --> 03:39:18.459
We have to leave something for another annual meeting.

03:39:18.459 --> 03:39:28.459
You see as keen students of the scriptures we can say that at this point in time still it hasn't become totally evident as to who is the king of the north.

03:39:28.459 --> 03:39:30.459
We look forward to the future.

03:39:30.459 --> 03:39:36.459
We'll see that as things develop it will become clear to us who the king of the north is.

03:39:36.459 --> 03:39:41.459
What is involved with the attack by Gog of May Gog.

03:39:41.459 --> 03:39:45.459
But in the meantime what do we know?

03:39:45.459 --> 03:39:54.459
Well we know for sure that when Gog of May Gog attacks he is going to be defeated and then destroyed completely.

03:39:54.459 --> 03:39:56.459
And also what do we know?

03:39:56.459 --> 03:40:03.459
God's people will be saved and I should into a new world of righteousness and truth peace and security.

03:40:03.459 --> 03:40:05.459
And how do we feel about that?

03:40:05.459 --> 03:40:07.459
We say hallelujah!

03:40:07.459 --> 03:40:40.409
May Jehovah be praised.

03:40:40.409 --> 03:40:44.409
Well we thank you brother Jackson for that outstanding discourse.

03:40:44.409 --> 03:40:47.409
What a marvelous annual meeting this has been.

03:40:47.409 --> 03:40:50.409
It's been a true banquet of spiritual things.

03:40:50.409 --> 03:41:06.100
Wouldn't you agree?

03:41:06.100 --> 03:41:08.100
Well that raises an important question.

03:41:08.100 --> 03:41:11.100
Is the annual meeting over now?

03:41:11.100 --> 03:41:16.100
Is this the end of the blessings that we're going to receive today?

03:41:16.100 --> 03:41:28.100
Well how exciting it was last October to receive the revised English edition of the New World Translation in printed and electronic formats.

03:41:28.100 --> 03:41:34.100
Well now since that time as you all know the large size edition has been made available.

03:41:34.100 --> 03:41:37.700
Can you guess?

03:41:38.700 --> 03:41:48.700
Well I'm very pleased to announce today the release of the pocket size edition of the revised English edition of the New World Translation.

03:41:48.700 --> 03:42:18.809
Of course this will be a wonderful blessing for those who are struggling to carry the large print edition.

03:42:18.809 --> 03:42:30.399
Well now when will you receive this beautiful new gift from Jehovah?

03:42:31.399 --> 03:43:02.459
Well I'm pleased to tell you that one copy is available for each one here in attendance in Jersey City but also for all of the satellite locations who are tied within us this day.

03:43:02.459 --> 03:43:15.000
So you can receive one copy as you exit from your respective seating locations.

03:43:15.000 --> 03:43:20.000
Now for those of the Bethel family who are tied in in their Bethel family rooms.

03:43:20.000 --> 03:43:27.000
You can feel free to pick up your copy in the normal Bethel literature areas after the meeting concludes.

03:43:27.000 --> 03:43:36.000
Now congregations can begin to request the pocket size edition starting Monday October 6, 2014.

03:43:36.000 --> 03:43:42.000
So it sounds like Monday is going to be a historic day.

03:43:42.000 --> 03:43:57.000
Well now speaking about our revised English edition of the New World Translation many of you have been asking if we will be producing a new audio recording of the Bible based on this new edition.

03:43:57.000 --> 03:44:22.479
Well the answer is yes this audio Bible is now in production but the style of recording is different from the previous recording of the Bible.

03:44:22.479 --> 03:44:27.479
Would you like to hear a sample of the new style of Bible reading?

03:44:27.479 --> 03:44:45.120
Well then would you please open your Bibles with me to Matthew chapter 15 and we're going to listen to verses 21 to 31.

03:44:45.120 --> 03:44:50.120
That's Matthew 15, 21 to 31.

03:44:50.120 --> 03:44:52.120
Please follow along.

03:44:52.120 --> 03:45:03.979
Leaving there Jesus now went into the region of Tyre and Sidon and look a Phoenician woman from that region came and cried out.

03:45:03.979 --> 03:45:11.979
Have mercy on me Lord son of David my daughter is cruelly demon possessed.

03:45:11.979 --> 03:45:19.979
But he did not say a word and answer to her so his disciples came and began to urge him.

03:45:19.979 --> 03:45:24.979
Send her away because she keeps crying out after us.

03:45:24.979 --> 03:45:31.979
He answered I was not sent to anyone except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

03:45:31.979 --> 03:45:46.979
But the woman came and did obeisance to him saying Lord help me in answer he said it is not right to take the bread of the children and throw it to the little dogs.

03:45:46.979 --> 03:45:56.979
She said yes Lord but really the little dogs do eat of the crumbs falling from the table of their masters.

03:45:56.979 --> 03:46:10.979
Then Jesus replied to her oh woman great is your faith let it happen to you as you wish and her daughter was healed from that hour on.

03:46:11.979 --> 03:46:19.979
Departing from there Jesus next came near the sea of Galilee and after going up on the mountain he was sitting there.

03:46:19.979 --> 03:46:24.979
Then large crowds approached him bringing along people who were lame.

03:46:24.979 --> 03:46:32.979
Mamed blind speechless and many others and they laid them at his feet and he cured them.

03:46:32.979 --> 03:46:46.979
So the crowd felt amazement as they saw the speechless speaking and the maimed being made sound and the lame walking and the blind seeing and they glorified the God of Israel.

03:46:46.979 --> 03:47:18.739
Well the governing body has approved the posting of these audio files of individual books on JW.org as they are completed rather than waiting for all the books of the Bible to be completed.

03:47:18.739 --> 03:47:26.739
Well it's hoped that these will begin to be posted on JW.org in the next few months.

03:47:26.739 --> 03:47:41.739
Well brothers and sisters truly we can say this has been a glorious day and we have so many reasons to thank Jehovah and truly as we face the time of the end.

03:47:42.739 --> 03:47:51.739
How important it is for each of us to take time to thank Jehovah not just today but every day.

03:47:51.739 --> 03:48:01.739
Taking time to meditate on the blessings that we have in our lives the many gifts that we receive from Jehovah is essential.

03:48:01.739 --> 03:48:10.739
If we are not going to be overwhelmed by negativity but rather we are going to maintain our joy in serving God.

03:48:10.739 --> 03:48:18.739
The Bible is filled with reminders for us to give thanks to Jehovah and to show ourselves grateful.

03:48:18.739 --> 03:48:35.739
Well regardless of the challenges we each may have in our lives when we are conscious of our blessings when we take time to meditate on them when we take time to thank Jehovah for them we are fortified we are strengthened.

03:48:36.739 --> 03:48:48.739
So dear brothers and sisters now as we look ahead to the 2015 service here we know that we are going to experience many many wonderful blessings.

03:48:48.739 --> 03:49:02.739
We may also experience some challenges but come what may may we be determined to follow to follow the council of our 2015 year text.

03:49:03.739 --> 03:49:26.520
Now are you ready? It's Psalm 106 and verse 1. Psalm 106 verse 1 says, give thanks to Jehovah for he is good.

03:49:26.520 --> 03:49:49.309
That is our year text for 2015. Well it's been a delight to be together with all of you for this historic annual meeting.

03:49:49.309 --> 03:50:07.620
And as a governing body we want to express that we truly love each and every one of you and we ask that you would please continue to pray for us just as we are continually praying for each one of you.

03:50:07.620 --> 03:50:21.620
Well now just for some final announcements to prevent overcrowding on the sidewalks here in Jersey City we're asking all to exit out the back of the auditorium and through the main lobby at the conclusion of the program.

03:50:21.620 --> 03:50:29.620
Exceptions will be made for elderly ones who have arrangements in place to be picked up on Pavonia Avenue.

03:50:29.620 --> 03:50:36.620
Now I know you're wondering about our attendance today so let me give you the figures give you a minute to get a pen.

03:50:36.620 --> 03:51:06.030
Here in Jersey City Assembly Hall we have 4,903 in Brooklyn 3,922 in Patterson 3,299 at Walkill 3,574 at Warwick Tuxedo 1,976 in Canada

03:51:06.030 --> 03:51:35.030
1,125 in Puerto Rico 147 in Jamaica 61 in Palm Coast Florida 102 and at the 4th Lauderdale Remote Translation Office 20 which gives us a total of 19,129 for this historic annual meeting.

03:51:35.030 --> 03:51:59.790
Now just before we conclude there's one last announcement and that's concerning those who have parked in the kidney parking garage.

03:51:59.790 --> 03:52:09.790
You may have your parking ticket validated in the lobby of the assembly hall at a reduced rate so we want to remind you of that before you leave the building.

03:52:09.790 --> 03:52:21.790
Well now to conclude our program we're going to give our attention once again to Brother Carlo Capano as he conducts our closing song Jehovah Is Your Name.

03:52:21.790 --> 03:52:37.790
Brother following the same pattern as our last song the chorus will sing this terrific song of praise to Jehovah's great name in its entirety.

03:52:37.790 --> 04:02:55.329
Measures 1 through 8 you to sing with good expression.

04:02:55.329 --> 04:03:08.819
We notice we have seven honorary members to our chorus. Here to my right.
