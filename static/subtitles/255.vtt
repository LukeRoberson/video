00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.449
For many years, I had no real desire to even pioneer.

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:16.449
Later, when I pioneered, I had no desire to go to Gilead.

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.449
I'm the kind of person who doesn't do things half-heartedly.

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:21.449
If I'm going to do it, I'll go all the way.

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.449
And so, once I was on that role,

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.449
missionary service was a goal that I had set before me

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.449
when I was about 17.

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.450
Really, missionary desires only came to my mind

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.450
and heart after I got to know Fiona.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.450
Actually, the very first day we met was in a special group

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.450
doing business with Nessing.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.450
And through the whole morning we worked together

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.450
and we talked about missionary work.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.450
And that's what made me think.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.450
I actually was single for a kingdom prior to that.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.450
But the more I got to know Fiona, my thoughts changed.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:05.530
We moved into the Chinese congregation in Brisbane, Australia.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.530
And that helped us to then basically set a course of life

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.530
into motion that would lead eventually to missionary work.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.530
We could see how we would adapt to pioneering

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.530
in a foreign language group, learning the language,

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.530
adapting to the culture.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.530
It was a great indication whether we could really

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:30.780
do missionary work or not.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.780
People may even look down on you thinking that you might be crazy.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.780
You know, like, why would you want to go to another country

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.780
when you could have a quite comfortable life here

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.780
back at home and still serve Jehovah?

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.780
I saw Jehovah's hand in my life

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.780
and I find that the more you put yourself in his hand

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.780
and the more scared you are and the more insecure you are,

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.780
that's when you really see Jehovah help you.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.780
So I really didn't feel I could qualify.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.780
I didn't have the right qualifications spiritually

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.780
as well as you did myself when it comes to the fruits of the spirit.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.780
I felt I was still a bit too stubborn, a bit too proud,

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.780
a bit too quick with my temper.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.780
It's amazing how that when you make the goal in your mind

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.780
how Jehovah helps you to learn those things quite quickly

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.780
and he puts you through situations which can mold you

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.780
according to his desire so he can use you more fully in those areas.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:28.129
I think my greatest challenge, especially now having started Gilead,

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:32.129
is going to be dealing with the fridge of the spirit.

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.129
You don't realize how many faults you have

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.129
and I think when we're going to be in such a close community

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.129
and living with others, your faults come out.

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:48.569
Definitely Gilead's call is truly a blessing from Jehovah

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.569
and we feel very privileged to be part of it

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.569
because it really teaches you to develop unbreakable faith

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.569
and trust in Jehovah as well as his organisation.

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.569
I wish everyone could have the education we're having here

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.569
and the education that we get on the Bible is just incredible.

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.569
If you can make the same choice now it might be hard

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.569
but put Jehovah to the test.

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.569
I recommend Gilead.

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.569
It's awesome.

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.569
Anything in Jehovah's service is only going to bring you enjoyment, happiness,

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:26.569
a sense of security inside despite living in a world that's full of insecurities.

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.569
I would never swap it for anything in the world.
