WEBVTT

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:05.540
Hey, Sophia, we know you're in there.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.939
Please, Jehovah, make it stop.

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:12.939
What are we doing?

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:14.939
Let's go.

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:40.689
All right, class.

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:43.689
Today, we're going to discuss.

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:46.689
Sophia, you're late.

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:48.189
I'm sorry.

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:49.189
I was...

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:51.689
Never mind. We'll talk about this later.

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:56.429
Okay, okay. That's enough.

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:58.929
Sophia, take your seat.

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:09.849
Today, we're going to discuss the difference between division and long division.

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:14.349
Okay, class. Here are the results from yesterday's test.

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:15.849
Good work, Sophia.

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:22.870
Hey, Angela. What you get?

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.250
I don't care.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.750
Whoa! Deep plus?

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.250
Well, at least there's a plus.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.670
Whatever.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.340
What are you looking at?

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.740
I didn't see you there.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.240
It's like you're invisible.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:33.629
Oh, what's this?

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:51.069
See you tomorrow.

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:57.310
Okay, let me help.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:11.539
Sometimes they pick on me too.

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:14.039
Miss Wilson said I could hold the bunny.

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:16.539
But I had to be very gentle.

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:18.039
Really?

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:20.039
I named him Fred.

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:24.039
But I didn't get to hold him for very long.

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:27.039
I'm pretty much a bunny expert now.

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:32.120
Is everything all right, honey?

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.069
Um, see you tomorrow.

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:53.759
Okay, let's talk about something very important.

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:55.759
Prayer.

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:59.259
Caleb, what are some things that you can pray for?

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:06.180
I can pray for things that make me happy.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:20.259
Like a helicopter, a mountain of ice cream, the belly ache.

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:27.319
I see.

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:30.819
But tell me, when we pray before bedtime,

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:32.319
what do we pray for?

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:36.730
Thank Jehovah for the good things he made.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.230
Like animals, the stars, and the ocean.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.560
God's kingdom.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.060
And to help our brothers and sisters.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.560
That's right.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.060
You can pray for your brothers and sisters.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.560
And remember, they are praying for you too.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.060
We know that when we pray for the right things, Jehovah hears us.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.379
He answered my prayers.

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:06.379
Oh, what's wrong, Sophia?

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:07.879
You can tell us.

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:11.750
There's a girl at school.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.750
She's so mean to me.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.410
Oh, no.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.910
Oh, honey, it's okay.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:27.980
I prayed for it to stop, but nothing's happened.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.480
Is Jehovah mad at me?

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.480
No, my dear.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.480
Jehovah isn't mad at you.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.980
Maybe Jehovah can't see me.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.480
No.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:48.870
There is someone in the Bible who felt the same way you do.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.870
Her name was Hannah.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:59.519
Hannah loved Jehovah very much.

00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:08.259
But someone named Penina was very mean to her.

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:12.259
It's so nice to see the children play, isn't it?

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:15.509
She had a bully too?

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:21.920
Yes.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.920
We're ready to eat.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.920
Here's your portion, Hannah.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.920
And Penina, here's yours.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:36.029
She was very jealous of Hannah.

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:40.240
I'll get some water.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.240
You think you're so special, Hannah?

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.240
Then why hasn't Jehovah given you any children?

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:57.319
Are you okay, Hannah?

00:06:57.319 --> 00:06:59.319
Why are you so sad?

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:03.319
Others could not understand why Hannah was so upset.

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:07.319
Because the pain was in her heart.

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:11.319
So she talked to the woman who would understand.

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:30.399
Oh, Jehovah, please see me.

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:35.399
Remember me, and do not forgive me.

00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:39.399
Please, give me a child.

00:07:39.399 --> 00:07:46.399
If you do, I will give him to you all his life to serve you.

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:54.740
What are you doing?

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.740
Why are you drunk?

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:03.920
I'm not drunk. I'm under great stress.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.920
Oh.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.920
I've been praying for Jehovah to help me.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.920
Go in peace.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:20.339
And may Jehovah give you what you've asked for.

00:08:20.339 --> 00:08:26.339
Do you know why Hannah felt better even though her prayer wasn't answered yet?

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:27.339
Why?

00:08:27.339 --> 00:08:32.340
Because Hannah knew Jehovah heard her prayer.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:38.340
When Jehovah listens to your prayers, he really listens.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:43.340
And he knows just what we need, even better than we do.

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.340
But how does he answer them?

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.340
In lots of different ways.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.340
Sometimes we just have to wait and see.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.340
Because he's busy?

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.340
No.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.340
Because it can be hard for us to see the answer.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:02.340
Let's talk about what you can pray for.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:08.779
And what you can do tomorrow at school to work along with those prayers.

00:09:08.779 --> 00:09:18.110
Those are going to be mean to me.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:22.870
These help me to be like Hannah tomorrow.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:31.720
She's strong like her.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.720
And then she went to the tabernacle and Ely was there.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.720
He was a high priest.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:10:03.480
Who it is?

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:16.289
What do you want, Angela?

00:10:16.289 --> 00:10:17.289
Oh.

00:10:17.289 --> 00:10:21.289
I was just wondering if you had a pen act about her.

00:10:21.289 --> 00:10:29.240
Why do?

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.870
Jehovah heard her prayer.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:37.519
Jehovah?

00:10:37.519 --> 00:10:39.519
It's me, Caleb.

00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:41.519
Please help Sophia.

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:45.820
Please.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.820
Help Sophia be strong and supportive.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.820
Watch over the children in our congregation.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.820
Like Caleb and Sophia.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.820
Please watch over our children.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.820
Help our children make you proud.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:58.820
Please, Jehovah.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.820
Give our children the strength they need to face.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:02.820
Jehovah.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:03.820
Please.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.820
They need your help.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.799
We ask you to spread out.

00:11:09.799 --> 00:11:10.799
In Jesus' name.

00:11:10.799 --> 00:11:20.360
Are you going to cry?

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.360
Stop, Angela.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.360
You're being mean.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:28.360
And if you keep being mean, I'm going to tell.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.360
No, you won't.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.360
Yes, I will.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.360
You can't tell me what to do.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.360
Let's go, Zoe.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:44.320
I, sister.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:48.529
I'm so brave.

00:11:48.529 --> 00:11:50.529
How did you do that?

00:11:50.529 --> 00:11:53.529
I prayed for courage and Jehovah helped me.

00:11:53.529 --> 00:12:06.740
Hannah gave birth to a son and named him Samuel.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.740
Because, as she said,

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:12.740
It is from Jehovah that I have asked him.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:19.779
There is no one holy like Jehovah.

00:12:19.779 --> 00:12:22.779
There is no one but you.

00:12:22.779 --> 00:12:30.120
Thank you, Jehovah.
