00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:09.060
When we're together with a large group of Jehovah's people in the ministry and at our meetings and assemblies

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.580
We really feel Jehovah's blessing, don't we?

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.460
But what if we're isolated?

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:17.859
What if we're facing persecution?

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:26.660
This is what Alphan's talk like spear in some years ago in Egypt. Let's see how Jehovah proved to be with him.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.659
It's always dark.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.979
Everything is pitch black dark.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:50.659
Easy pros are always Israel, and they were arresting the brothers, charging us of practicing illegal activities as a band organization.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.979
On that night, we'd be in transfer to the concentration camp.

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.340
We couldn't see much.

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:06.819
What's going there? What does this place look like? Where is it?

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:10.620
It's the Israelese.

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:21.799
The officers get two soldiers to escort us to our cell where the brothers were.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:30.840
We know that when people taken to the concentration camp, they spend his and some of them never send back.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:45.060
When I was in a teenager, I liked the characters in the bar, like Abraham, Daniel, Moses.

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:51.939
I thought they're champions of the true worship, and some stage I felt jealous of them.

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:58.659
They got this huge relationship with God, so I'd like to be part of that.

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.340
I'll continue to reach the barber to get closer to God.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.180
I know that Jehovah will come after him. He will not abandon his seven.

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:16.740
So we try to encourage them, brothers, keep in mind that we hear because we worship Jehovah.

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:24.259
We set together to discuss what we're going to do to keep on as spiritual as strong.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.419
We thought that we need to pray.

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:34.580
If we pick up a scripture every day, like a daily text, and then after that result,

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:42.020
a scripture, one will handle a talk from the memory of God, and then an open discussion of

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.340
Bible question. At that stage, we didn't have Bible with us.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:57.719
The officers went to us to renown our face, so they told me to learn the ground,

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:06.360
and they started to beat me. The whole camp was around, and one of the prisoners fainted.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.280
So I started to pray to Jehovah, to help me, to be able to induce that.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:19.080
It was very severe pain, and I felt his help because after a few beating my body fell numb.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.560
I don't feel much more pain. One of the prisoners said to me,

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.280
if I get out of here alive, I will tell my children that in the concentration camp,

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:37.719
I've seen the Christian, remind me with the first century Christian that they were happy even

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:44.439
to die without renowning their face. One of the officers, this, you know,

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:50.360
a nice one that used to beat us very, very severely, came one day and he said,

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.479
we need two of you to come out, and write a report about what do you believe?

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.479
So we thought about, is it wise to do that, or maybe they use it against us?

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:05.960
You know, pray to Jehovah for help to make a decision. He to guide us what to do.

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:14.199
In the end, we reached a point that, well, we may get out, may not. So, might as well give them a witness.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.160
I told the officer, we need a Bible. And he said, what for?

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:30.279
I said to him, because we need to cut from the Bible in this report. So he said, okay, you have

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:35.000
a Bible in the sorrow, he said, yes, I have a Bible. He said, okay, go and get your Bible.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:54.360
I went to my bag and picked up the Bible. So I picked up the Bible of my hand up and it ran

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:01.240
them down, it started raining. Numbers, it looked like a whole lot of this book. I said to him,

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:11.800
Moses, on the top of his voice. So I kept quiet and he closed the book again and

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:24.839
opened it again. Again, on top of his head, I was racing in my mind where it is written and the

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:32.199
Bible that Jehovah told Moses to write any of this. He shot the book again for a fair time and

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:35.079
opened it again and he started reading the load books.

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:52.759
So the officer looked at me with big surprise in his face. After we wrote the report,

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:58.279
so I asked him, can we keep the Bible place? He said, okay, keep the Bible.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:06.439
So three months near the every day, the officer comes in and beat us and expect us to compromise.

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:14.600
We never did that. All I can say is Jehovah's hand. Jehovah's helping us to endure, to continue to do

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:27.290
his will, not compromising because we belong to him and we rhyme him. God will not abandon his seven.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:37.160
Why was Alphonse thrown into prison? It wasn't because he refused to say a simple greeting to

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:45.240
the president of his country. No, that phrase was a political slogan. Like many Jehovah's witnesses,

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:54.360
Alphonse was persecuted for his neutrality.
