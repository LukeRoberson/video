How you talk?

Who your family is

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.539
Who your friends are

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:40.659
What you believe in it could be anything that has perceived is different

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:44.740
But no matter what it's not your fault

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.009

Some effects are obvious from the outside

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:23.170
But there's a lot happening on the inside that we don't get to see like fear

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:25.849
stress and

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:27.849
sadness

Think of ways you can protect yourself

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:38.210
Proverbs 223 says a shrewd person sees the calamity coming and conceals himself

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:45.069

School officials or a trusted adult

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.699
Even though you might feel like a telltale

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:24.939
