00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:09.839
Incredible. That's the only way to describe it.

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:17.079
The word had gone out that the Jews who had been captives in Babylon were free to leave

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:21.320
and return to their homeland, Israel.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:29.960
Now you all know why that was incredible, because Babylon never released its captives.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.719
The Babylon had been overthrown, and the new administration had said that the Jews

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:44.000
were free to go. Only Jehovah could have been responsible for that.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:54.759
So every family had had a decision to make to leave Babylon or to stay behind.

00:00:54.759 --> 00:01:01.479
Now you might say there was no decision to make it all. That's not a hard decision.

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:11.599
But wait, hold it. Most of the Jews had been born in Babylon, and most of their parents

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:22.079
had been born in Babylon. It was the only home they knew. Their roots were there.

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:26.920
And according to certain records, some of them had gone prosperous. Some of them had

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:34.079
gone wealthy. There are records of Jews buying and selling precious gems and other luxury

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:43.200
items. So one says, I can't leave Babylon. My business partner is a Babylonian, and that

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.599
business is doing really well, and there'd be no market for the products we sell in Israel.

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:57.000
Another would say, my son married a Babylonian woman, and they'd just had a baby. Our first

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.280
grandchild, he's so cute I can't leave now. So on the one hand, you have these material

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.039
benefits from remaining in Babylon. But on the other hand, the ability of the Jews to

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:19.560
worship Jehovah freely was severely limited. It said that there were 50 pagan temples

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:27.560
in the capital alone. But there was no temple of Jehovah there. The Levites weren't able

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.159
to follow the law of Moses properly. They could only do so to a limited degree. So you

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:39.719
had material advantages to staying, but the spiritual blessings that awaited those

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:47.120
who chose to leave were going to be immense. And for spiritually minded Jews, it was no

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:54.919
contest, because they wanted to leave Babylon and reestablish pure worship in the promised

00:02:54.919 --> 00:03:04.120
land in Israel. And so if they were physically able to do so, they would leave Babylon and

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:14.800
travel to Jerusalem. A city, most of them had never seen a city in ruins. But Jehovah

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:22.120
promised to make the trip from Babylon to Jerusalem as easy as possible. And to confirm

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.199
that and to get a little picture in our minds, we're going to read a series of four different

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:33.560
scriptures. And each scripture is going to add a little detail to what Jehovah had in mind.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:41.240
So the first one is founded Isaiah chapter 40, verses 3 and 4. And I'll wait a moment

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:48.319
because it'd be good if we could read this together. This is Isaiah chapter 40, the well-known

00:03:48.319 --> 00:04:00.379
words of verses 3 and 4, a voice of one calling in the wilderness, clear up the way of Jehovah,

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:08.099
make a straight highway through the desert, a straight highway through the desert for our

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:15.699
God. Let every valley be raised up, and every mountain and hill be made low. The rough

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:23.139
ground must become level, and the rugged ground of valley plain. In every time I read these

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:29.779
words, I think of Brother Kerry Barber. He must have loved this passage because very often,

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:36.540
in his prayers, he would quote this passage word for word, good memories of Brother Barber.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:43.660
Now it talks about making a straight highway through the desert. If some of you have gone

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:51.740
to the Ramapul project, you know what site work is all about. How would you like to have

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.779
the construction committee in Ramapul take that job on? Make a straight highway through

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:01.939
the desert. When you come to a mountain, you've got to level it. You come to a valley,

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:06.220
you've got to bring it up. That would be quite a job. I think they have enough on their

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.339
plate. They don't need to worry about this kind of site work. But this was going to be a big job,

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:17.980
but in the end, it would be a lot easier to travel on a straight highway than to go up and down

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:25.180
a mountain or down a valley, and it would be a lot faster too. So we know that there's going to be a

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:36.610
straight highway between Babylon and Jerusalem. What else can we learn? Isaiah 57, Isaiah 57 and verse 14.

00:05:42.829 --> 00:05:50.350
Verse 14 says, it will be said, build up, build up a road, prepare the way, and here it comes,

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:59.149
remove any obstacle from the way of my people. So now we have two details. It's going to be a

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:05.149
straight highway through the desert, and all of the obstacles are going to be cleared away.

00:06:06.269 --> 00:06:11.629
But not most highways have a name. Some of them are named after famous people. Others have

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:20.990
a number. Does this special highway have a name? It does. When we go to Isaiah 35, 8 to 10 to find

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:30.079
that name. I'm giving you a real workout this morning. But we have to do this to put it all together.

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:41.920
Isaiah 35 verses 8 to 10. And a highway will be there, yes, a way called, here it comes, the way of

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:48.800
holiness. The unclean one will not travel on it. It is reserved for the one walking on the way.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:59.120
No one foolish will stray onto it. No lion will be there, and no vicious wild beasts will come on it.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:06.959
They will not be found there. Only the repurchased ones will walk there. So what's the name?

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:13.519
What's the special name of this highway? The way of holiness. Isn't that a nice name for a highway?

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:25.199
Rattlesnakes, bears, foxes, and cougars are not allowed. I don't care how cute you think they are.

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:33.680
They're not allowed on this special highway. Now what else can we learn about this special highway?

00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:41.279
Today, you don't know who's traveling in the car next to yours. It could be somebody who has no

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:48.079
business driving a car. The driver could be drunk. He could be on drugs. But on this highway,

00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:55.519
the unclean one is not permitted. Those who would break God's laws are not permitted to travel on

00:07:55.519 --> 00:08:02.959
that highway. Well, we're talking about the highway between Babylon and Jerusalem, and no doubt

00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:06.879
unclean ones among the Jews wouldn't be interested in going back to Israel anyway.

00:08:07.519 --> 00:08:13.040
Now they were probably very much at home with the idolatry of Babylon. Remember,

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:19.040
their forefathers were no strangers to idolatry. So only those who were clean and acceptable

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:26.800
in Jehovah's eyes were welcome to travel from Babylon back to Jerusalem. Now let's be clear.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:34.799
We don't know whether there was any literal road work done on the road between Babylon and Israel.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:40.639
It may be all figurative, but there could have been some road work done. Notice what Jehovah

00:08:40.879 --> 00:08:49.279
told the Jews to do in Jeremiah chapter 31 and verse 21. And you'd say,

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:55.039
why would Jehovah say all of these things if it was all to be ignored, literally?

00:08:55.759 --> 00:09:05.360
Jeremiah 31 and verse 21. He says, set up road markers for yourself and put up sign posts.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:11.200
Pay attention to the highway, the way that you have to go. Return over to

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:20.399
Virgin of Israel. Return to these cities of yours. So no doubt the first groups to use the road

00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:26.879
would remove obstacles and level things out the best they could so that those who followed

00:09:26.879 --> 00:09:32.559
would have an easier journey. So now what have we learned? What have we gleaned from this series

00:09:32.559 --> 00:09:39.679
of scriptures? First, there's a highway, a highway through the desert. We've also learned

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:46.399
that it's to be cleared of obstacles. It has a special name, the way of holiness,

00:09:46.399 --> 00:09:52.399
and there were to be sign posts so that those who traveled the road wouldn't get lost and

00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:59.360
may be stray onto some other road. Now what was the goal? Why did Jehovah want this road to be

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:09.360
prepared so nicely to make it as easy as possible for the Jews to leave Babylon and go back

00:10:09.679 --> 00:10:18.960
to Israel and reestablish pure worship? Did it work? Tens of thousands of men, women,

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:26.159
and children responded to the call, the invitation, and with Jehovah's help, they arrived safely

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:33.919
at their destination. While you might be thinking this is all very nice, but what does it have to do

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:42.240
with me? What does it have to do with us today? Plenty. Because today, not tens of thousands,

00:10:43.039 --> 00:10:50.240
but millions of men, women, and children are responding to the command, the urgent command,

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:57.360
get out of her, get out of Babylon the great. And the situation is different from the situation

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:02.960
of the Jews in ancient times because they had a choice. They could remain in Babylon and still

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:11.759
serve Jehovah. But people today have no choice. They must leave Babylon the great. Their life

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:19.360
depends on it. Now without looking for a type and anti-type and trying to fit everything in very

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:26.480
neatly in this arrangement, we can say that there are some similarities between what happened

00:11:26.559 --> 00:11:33.679
to the Jews in ancient times and what is happening today. Because in a sense, when you start to study

00:11:33.679 --> 00:11:40.559
the Bible with someone, you are pointing him in the direction of the way of holiness. Now some

00:11:40.559 --> 00:11:45.840
start studying, and they start traveling on the road, and then they turn back. But others keep

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:55.200
going, and they become dedicated, baptized disciples of Christ. Some travel in the fast lane. They

00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:02.080
make rapid progress. Others quarter take the far right lane, and they poke along, but they keep

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:09.440
making progress. And as long as they keep making progress, we'll study with them. Some break down,

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:17.809
and that calls for roadside assistance. But it's easier to travel on the way of holiness today

00:12:18.529 --> 00:12:25.809
than it ever has been. And friends, this is partly due to the spiritual

00:12:25.809 --> 00:12:34.210
sight work that was started centuries ago. I'm going to repeat that. It is easier to travel

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:41.409
the highway of holiness today because of the spiritual sight work that was started hundreds

00:12:41.409 --> 00:12:50.289
of years ago, long before Babylon the Great fell, long before the road was open for travelers.

00:12:51.009 --> 00:12:59.730
Now picture this, it's the 16th century. With shovel in hand, you are about to start

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:07.570
sight work on the way of holiness. There's a mountain ahead of you, a mountain of ignorance,

00:13:08.289 --> 00:13:12.450
and you realize that if you're going to start to level that mountain, the first thing you're

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:18.210
going to have to do is get the Bible into the hands of the people. For years, the Bible was

00:13:18.289 --> 00:13:25.009
only in Latin, and mostly educated people could read it, and even some of the clergy only knew

00:13:25.009 --> 00:13:29.889
enough Latin to conduct church services, but otherwise they couldn't understand it.

00:13:31.169 --> 00:13:36.769
Well, if you've been to our beautiful museum, some of you have taken a tour recently,

00:13:37.409 --> 00:13:43.809
you know that translators in many countries risk their freedom and even their lives to put the

00:13:43.809 --> 00:13:50.529
Bible into the language of the common people. And then printers produced those translations,

00:13:50.529 --> 00:13:54.850
and some of them used in a assumed name because if they got caught printing a Bible,

00:13:56.049 --> 00:14:04.529
they could be arrested and even worse. So the mountain had to be leveled a shovelful at a time,

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:11.409
one Bible at a time to reduce that mountain on the way of holiness.

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:19.570
To get the Bible into the hands of the people, William Tyndall arranged to have thousands of

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:24.690
copies of his translations smuggled into England in bails of cotton and other goods.

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:32.529
This was dangerous. Tyndall's translation was banned in England, and if you merely possessed a

00:14:32.529 --> 00:14:36.610
copy of the Bible, that could bring you a stint in the Tower of London or worse.

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:44.450
But despite desperate attempts to stop work on the way of holiness, more copies of Tyndall's

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:51.169
Bible were printed than the clergy could ever destroy. By the way, you'll be interested in a

00:14:51.169 --> 00:14:57.970
comment that Tyndall made in his comments on the book of Genesis 1530 translation of the book of

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:06.210
Genesis. He wrote, Chahova is God's name. Neither is any creature so-called. As often as

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:16.049
thou seeest Lord in capital letters, it is in Hebrew Chahova. Early on, the name Chahova was given

00:15:16.049 --> 00:15:23.250
some recognition. Well, with the Bible becoming more available to the people, you'd expect that

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:28.769
students of the Bible would want to share their research with others, and that was the case.

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:35.889
In the years leading up to 1919, when Bible and the Great Fell, more wordwork was done.

00:15:35.889 --> 00:15:42.610
And so we have men who share the footage of the research and tracks in books, publications

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:49.009
of all kinds, because they want the people to know. They want to reduce that mountain of ignorance.

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:58.129
For example, about 1835, a Bible student by the name of Henry Groo wrote a pamphlet on the immortality

00:15:58.129 --> 00:16:05.330
of the soul. And in that pamphlet, Groo explained from the Bible that immortality is a reward for

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:12.129
faithfulness, or not born with it. Now, he published the track anonymously, because he knew there'd

00:16:12.129 --> 00:16:19.570
be trouble. And later on, there was trouble for Henry Groo. Well, he publishes a track,

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:24.850
but two years later, another Bible student, George Storis, is riding into train.

00:16:26.049 --> 00:16:33.970
And he looks down, and he sees a track there. And it's Henry Groo's track on the immortality of

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:39.809
the soul. He reads it, and he becomes convinced that man doesn't have an immortal soul. So what does

00:16:39.809 --> 00:16:47.090
he do? He picks up a shovel, and he starts working on the road, the road, the way of holiness.

00:16:47.809 --> 00:16:55.169
In 1842, he gave a series of lectures on the intriguing theme, Are the Wicked Immortal.

00:16:56.049 --> 00:16:59.649
And he later published those lectures. Do you know how many copies were produced?

00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:09.410
200,000 copies of that series of lectures. So that was decent roadwork on that way of

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:16.450
holiness. Well, Storis knew that he didn't have the whole truth on every subject. And in 1847,

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:22.289
he made quite an interesting statement, it'd be interesting for us. He says, we do well to remember

00:17:22.289 --> 00:17:29.890
that we have just emerged from the dark ages of the church. And notice this, it would not be strange

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:37.730
if we should find some Babylonian garments still worn by us. Well, he was right.

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:45.650
Babylon, Babylon still had influence in those days. Well, we know that George Storis had an

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:52.289
influence on Charles Tay's Russell. And what do we know about Brother Russell and his associates?

00:17:54.049 --> 00:17:58.690
They weren't the first to discover that the Trinity and the immortality of the soul are

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:03.490
false doctrines, or even that Christ's presence would be invisible to the human eye.

00:18:04.289 --> 00:18:11.250
They benefited from the careful preparatory work that other road workers had done in the past.

00:18:12.289 --> 00:18:19.329
So, translators, printers, and Bible students were doing spiritual site work.

00:18:20.049 --> 00:18:25.089
And we might say that Brother Russell and his associates put the final touches on that way

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:34.609
of holiness. Well, Babylon the Great fell in 1919, and then the wave of holiness was opened for

00:18:34.609 --> 00:18:45.569
travelers. But Brother Russell died in 1916. Did he miss it? Did he miss the inauguration of the road?

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:54.529
I don't think so. He didn't have a bird's eye view of the opening of the road. He had a heaven's eye

00:18:55.490 --> 00:19:00.529
view. Because Brother Russell and his associates who had finished their earthly course,

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:05.490
they were able to look down from the heavens, and can you imagine how excited they were?

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:12.930
When they saw the first travelers set foot on the way of holiness, it must have been very

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:19.490
exciting for them for them indeed. And it wouldn't be surprising if Brother Russell and his

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:27.170
associates were firmly involved in the maintenance program of that wave of holiness today.

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:34.289
Because every good road needs ongoing maintenance. The way of holiness is open,

00:19:34.849 --> 00:19:41.650
but maintenance on that way of holiness goes on. And what's the goal? It's to make it as easy

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:48.690
as possible for people to identify Babylon the Great and to leave Babylon the Great. That is the

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:56.849
goal. We'll take the Bible, for example. There were Bible translations in 1919. But some of them had

00:19:56.849 --> 00:20:03.730
were in archaic language that was hard to understand, and most of them didn't give the divine name

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:09.809
the place of honor that it deserved. But now we have the New World translation. What a blessing

00:20:09.809 --> 00:20:15.730
that has proved to be. It's so clear. And you don't have to mortgage the house to buy a copy,

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:23.009
which was probably the case in the 16th century. And since 1919, there's been an abundance of

00:20:23.009 --> 00:20:28.369
spiritual food to make it easier for people to come into the truth. Now just think of this.

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:37.490
In 1919, Babylon the Great fell. But what else happened in 1919? What provision did Jehovah make

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:45.089
for these people? The faithful and discreet slave was appointed in that same year. And the slave

00:20:45.089 --> 00:20:51.650
didn't waste any time to start producing literature that was going to make it easier for people

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:59.970
to come into the truth. 1919, the slave was appointed by 1921. You have a brand new publication,

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:06.529
the harp of God. And it was especially designed for beginners and to make it easy for people to

00:21:06.529 --> 00:21:12.849
study and read and come into the truth. And that was necessary because in 1921, there was a shortage

00:21:13.009 --> 00:21:18.690
of teachers, our publishers who could conduct Bible studies with people. So you really needed

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:26.769
something simple. And comparatively speaking, that harp of God was simple. Now there were very few

00:21:26.769 --> 00:21:32.930
publishers in those days, just a few thousand. But they were workers. They did a tremendous job.

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:41.569
Do you realize that before the harp of God went out of print, almost six million copies in

00:21:41.569 --> 00:21:49.650
22 languages had been circulated? So this is evidence that maintenance work on the way of

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:57.730
holiness had begun right after the road opened. Well, I doubt that very many in this audience

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:03.329
have come into the truth through the harp of God. Anybody here? I don't think so.

00:22:05.009 --> 00:22:11.009
What publication brought you into the truth? What publication helped you to identify the way

00:22:11.009 --> 00:22:19.730
of holiness? Was it the truth? Shall make you free? Let God be true. The truth that leads to

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:29.329
eternal life. You can live forever. The knowledge book. Enjoy life forever. Teach us what does the

00:22:29.329 --> 00:22:38.289
Bible teach us? Or is it our fine new publication? Enjoy life forever. All of these publications have

00:22:38.289 --> 00:22:43.569
been used to help people to break free from babbling the great. And this is proof positive

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:53.170
that maintenance on the way of holiness is ongoing. This road work continues and it gets better

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:58.450
and better. Are you studying the Bible with someone with the help of enjoy life forever?

00:22:59.329 --> 00:23:05.890
If you are, you're pointing that person to the way of holiness. So don't be afraid to

00:23:06.529 --> 00:23:13.329
offer studies as brother Sanderson mentioned. Business associates, relatives, schoolmates,

00:23:13.329 --> 00:23:19.569
anybody you can think of offer Bible studies and you'll be surprised at who will take you up on it.

00:23:19.569 --> 00:23:24.529
And as you do, keep in mind that while the road has been made easier for travelers,

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:31.250
setting foot on that road takes courage and effort. So let's be ready to help those who are

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:39.250
willing to respond. Millions have already taken that road and is our hope that millions more

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:51.809
will do so before the end of this system of things. And we wish them all safe travels.
