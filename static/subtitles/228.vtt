00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:06.160
Thank you for joining us for this JW Broadcasting Special Update.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.919
We have a video report from Azerbaijan on the experience of two sisters who were released

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:34.020
after 11 months in jail for sharing their faith.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.679
On December 5, 2014, authorities in Azerbaijan arrested sisters Arina Zakocenko and

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:46.619
deleted Jabrayila, simply for offering the teacher children brochure to one of their neighbors.

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:52.179
The person they were witnessing to had expressed interest and even requested the brochure.

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:54.859
Their actions were completely legal.

00:00:54.859 --> 00:01:00.179
However, for 11 months, authorities kept them isolated in filthy jail cells where guards

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:02.859
humiliated and mocked them.

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:07.439
Conditions in prison severely harmed the health of both sisters, but particularly sisters

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.459
Zakocenko.

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:15.260
Now many of your brothers and sisters closely followed these events in the JW.org newsroom.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.079
You offered countless prayers on their behalf, petitioning Jehovah for their well-being

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.060
and release.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.099
Also local brothers repeatedly appealed the court's unjust decisions to detain the sisters.

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:32.819
Headquarters representatives brought Arina and Valida's plight to the attention of international

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:34.939
officials.

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:41.260
The experience of these two sisters assures us of Jehovah's concern for those facing trials.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:47.140
2 Peter 2 and verse 9 says that Jehovah knows how to rescue people of Godly devotion

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.780
out of trial.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.260
And Psalm 34 and verse 15 guarantees that the eyes of Jehovah are on the righteous and

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.980
his ears listen to their cry for help.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:05.260
The release of Arina and Valida from prison on January 28, 2016 confirms the truthfulness

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.379
of these verses.

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:12.460
In this report, Arina and Valida recount what they went through and how they personally

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:23.860
felt Jehovah's sustaining power.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.020
Last year has proved to be a terrible experience for me.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.900
It was December of 2014.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.819
I was sharing the good news with people.

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.139
I did not expect at all that this would happen.

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:44.969
We were detained by police officers.

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:51.889
On 17 February 2015, when the judge announced his custodial sentence, I did not realize that

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:55.289
I was being jailed.

00:02:55.289 --> 00:03:03.750
It's only when I was put in a cell I realized that I've been jailed.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.229
It was a small cell with a little window and the cell sank.

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:12.830
We were desperate even for some fresh air.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.870
The door had a peephole and guards would often look through it.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.669
That made me feel really uncomfortable and embarrassed.

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:26.389
When I was in detention, I was worried about my family because I am concerned about their

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.710
spirituality.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.629
I am concerned about how they are coping without me and I am concerned about my family's

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:35.629
security.

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:45.439
They investigated, told me, everyone has turned away from you.

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:46.439
You've been abandoned.

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:53.099
Jehovah's Witnesses have left you too.

00:03:53.099 --> 00:04:00.699
Even when they escorted us to court, they would make sure we were not able to see anyone.

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:04.580
For almost 11 months, I did not have access to a Bible.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.780
This made it very difficult for me.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.580
However, I recalled the examples of the prophets and that really helped.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.939
Now that I was in prison, I could really understand how they had felt.

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:19.939
The scripture that helped me the most was Philippians 4.13.

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:23.740
For all things I have the strength through the one who gives me power.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:31.779
I knew Jehovah God was the one strengthening me.

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:36.379
My imprisonment had been extended for the third time.

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:39.860
After the hearing, I felt really down.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.699
I begged Jehovah, Jehovah, I am such a need for a kind word.

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:49.500
For you care, Jehovah, please help me.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.259
I was crying as I was being led back to myself.

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:58.939
There was a guard there who had shouted at me before for being a Jehovah's Witness.

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:02.620
When he saw me crying, he asked me, why are you here?

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:14.790
I said, for God's name, if you are here because of God, be patient and endure, God will help you.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.550
That really scared me up.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.149
Above all, it was prayer to Jehovah that helped me.

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:32.470
Because your brothers and sisters, your family, they can be taken away from you.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:41.949
But it was prayer to Jehovah and the knowledge I received in the organization that helped me endure under trials.

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:49.189
After ten months, I was transferred to prison in Kurdakhane.

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:56.110
One day I received a package from home. It was food sent by my family.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:02.149
When I saw a Bible in the package, I was so happy, I was overjoyed.

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:12.220
There was a woman there, she said, look at her, she's so happy about her Bible that she forgot about the food.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:18.019
The court hearing was approaching. I was constantly praying to Jehovah.

00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:24.139
The lady who was the victim had falsely claimed that I told her God will destroy the earth.

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:32.500
I could not prepare Bible verses as a reply to this.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:40.420
In the courtroom, I was able to quote a Bible verse of my heart against her false accusation.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:49.500
It was Psalm 104 verse 5, where it says that Jehovah has firmly established the foundations of the earth,

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:55.649
and the earth will not be moved.

00:06:55.649 --> 00:07:01.579
I did not have a grudge against the woman who had falsely accused me.

00:07:01.579 --> 00:07:08.420
I said to her in the courtroom, despite all the suffering I forgive you.

00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:15.980
Because in the Bible God says, you must love even your enemies.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:23.209
So God teaches that. I forgive you.

00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:29.850
I was so happy when I was released, most of all because I was able to stay faithful to Jehovah.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:33.860
I'm thankful to Jehovah.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.459
When I was in prison, I could see that the whole brotherhood is praying for us,

00:07:38.459 --> 00:07:44.899
and I had really experienced the power of prayer.

00:07:44.899 --> 00:07:49.660
Now I am determined to always pray for brothers who are facing difficulties,

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:57.459
so that they too may experience the power of prayer.

00:07:57.459 --> 00:08:05.980
I am grateful for the fact that I am home at last.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:09.459
I am reunited with my family and my brothers and sisters.

00:08:09.459 --> 00:08:15.420
I can pray in attend congregation meetings.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:23.100
Our fellow believers worldwide, Jehovah's Witnesses, had written letters to me.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:27.980
When I was released and received those letters, that once again proved to me

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:32.700
that Jehovah and his people had never left me.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:41.360
I'm grateful for this to Jehovah and to his people.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:46.000
Arena and Valida continue to recover from their 11-month ordeal,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.039
and we truly commend them for their integrity,

00:08:49.039 --> 00:08:55.480
which really calls to mind Romans 1 and verse 8, which reads,

00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:01.000
first of all, I give thanks to my God through Jesus Christ concerning all of you,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.460
because your faith is talked about throughout the whole world.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:12.419
These faithful sisters are two of many who give a witness by word and action

00:09:12.419 --> 00:09:18.019
despite suffering trials, reminding us of Hebrews 11, verse 34,

00:09:18.019 --> 00:09:23.019
which says, from a week's date, they were made powerful.

00:09:23.019 --> 00:09:28.059
As we think of our brothers and sisters imprisoned in Eritrea, Turkmenistan,

00:09:28.059 --> 00:09:31.299
South Korea, Singapore, and elsewhere,

00:09:31.299 --> 00:09:37.039
we think of the words at Hebrews 13, verse 3.

00:09:37.039 --> 00:09:43.320
It says, keep in mind those in prison, as though you were imprisoned with them,

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:50.039
and those being mistreated since you yourselves also are in the body.

00:09:50.039 --> 00:09:55.080
Well, you can see how our two sisters were encouraged by your prayers and letters.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:00.519
Thank you for keeping in mind all those who suffer as integrity keepers.

00:10:00.519 --> 00:10:05.879
And let us all thank Jehovah for strengthening these dear sisters and delivering them.

00:10:05.879 --> 00:10:11.440
And like Arena, we also praise God who, according to Philippians 413,

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.320
is the one who gives us power.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.000
Thank you for joining us for this report from Brooklyn, New York.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
