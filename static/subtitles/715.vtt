00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:08.619
The next part of our program is one that we've come to enjoy so much in the past few

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:09.619
years.

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:15.220
It's the pre-recorded video, The Inside Story.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.780
This installment of The Inside Story will be hosted by Brother Kenneth Stovall with

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.820
our Theocratic Schools Department.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:50.539
So let's give attention to and enjoy this video.

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.140
Welcome to this edition of The Inside Story.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.939
Open yourself as a child, growing up in a country where our work is under ban.

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:00.700
What would that be like?

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.659
You're going to find out as we talk to a couple from Romania.

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.140
Are you familiar with the progress of our work in India?

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.540
I think you're in for a few surprises as we talk to four students that come to us from

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.780
the India branch.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.900
But let's get started by introducing our first guests.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.299
From Romania, please welcome Yo Notes and Dahlia Chico.

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:23.299
Thank you.

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:24.299
Thank you.

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.290
Good to see you, Brother Fossil.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.209
Welcome to The Inside Story.

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:34.049
It's a privilege to be here.

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.650
Yes, it is, but a nervous privilege.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.049
Well, I hope you're not too nervous.

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.609
Well, to start with, could you just help us to understand how the work got started in

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:44.930
Romania?

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.930
The work started in 1911.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:56.409
By 1919, there were over 1,700 publishers and 150 groups of congregations in Romania.

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.129
My goodness, that was very fast growth.

00:01:59.129 --> 00:02:01.090
But there was some opposition to the work.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.090
Yes.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.049
In 1949, the communist government banned our work.

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.409
And sadly, it lasted until 1990.

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:10.409
That's amazing.

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:12.969
So that's 40 years under ban.

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:17.090
But now as I understand it, that's when both your families got the truth.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.490
And the ban was going on, is that correct?

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.490
Yes.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.009
My mother was a baby when my grandparents got baptized.

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:26.610
So she grew up in the truth.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.050
In fact, my grandmother was a pioneer under the ban for many years.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.169
Later, my two sisters and I were raising the truth.

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:36.169
Very interesting.

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:37.409
And Yo Notes, what about you?

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:42.689
My parents were contacted by the witnesses 10 years before the ban was lifted.

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:46.090
So my sister and I were also raised in the truth.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.729
So this is very interesting.

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:52.889
Often we have talked about brothers who were faithful under ban, who were adults.

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:55.250
But you were children while the ban was going on.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.490
And you stayed faithful.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.409
So, daily, do you remember what it was like going to meetings under ban?

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:02.409
Yes.

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.169
We met secretly in small groups.

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:07.530
The friends would arrive at different times.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.330
But once everyone was inside the home, we would love the gate and the door and pull

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.409
down all of the shades.

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.610
The meetings were moved to a different location each week.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:18.610
Very interesting.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.330
Now, it must have been though that you probably had to miss a lot of meetings under ban.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.330
No.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.330
No.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.169
We didn't want to miss any opportunity to meet together.

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:32.370
But were you frightened in these meetings where you pulled down on the shades that you

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.090
might be discovered or arrested?

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.889
You might think so, but the opposite was true.

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.969
I felt the most safe when we were all together.

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:42.969
You could feel Jehovah's protection.

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:44.849
That's very touching.

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.090
So, you know, did you and Deelia know each other growing up?

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.090
Yes.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.449
We grew up in the same town, Negreste wash, so our families knew each other.

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:59.530
So, did your families then occasionally attend the same meetings?

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.530
No.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.009
We didn't.

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:06.969
You see, my family was in a separate group from Deelia's family.

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:08.289
In a separate group.

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:10.650
Now, explain what you mean.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:16.569
You might remember Brother Losh's video from the 2018 annual meeting.

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:22.610
He explained how government spies infiltrated the witnesses in Romania, and this made it

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.009
difficult to know who to trust.

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:30.850
This caused the witnesses to separate into two large groups.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:37.930
One group stayed in contact with warhead quarters in Brooklyn, and the other did not.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.290
But what groups continued to worship Jehovah?

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.290
Amazing.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.290
So, you grew up both of you as Jehovah's Witnesses, but associating with different groups.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.930
Now, did one group view the other group as apostates?

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.889
Generally, no.

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.129
We didn't see the other group as apostates.

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:59.730
Our beliefs were essentially the same.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:00.730
Yes.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:06.730
I should mention that when I was small, I remember my mother stayed up one night studying.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.290
But a whole night of study, meditation, and prayer, she decided to switch to the group

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.009
connected to the main organization.

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:18.009
So, that's why I grew up as a part of the group associated with the main organization.

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:24.329
My, it sounds like your mother was very conscientious and set a really good example for you.

00:05:24.329 --> 00:05:30.209
I, I deeply appreciate her and my grandparents for being faithful examples and good teachers.

00:05:30.209 --> 00:05:31.209
Okay.

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:34.250
When you say good teachers, what do you mean?

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.610
For example, we have, we kept beehives in our garden.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.810
My mother helped us see how Jehovah made them to be industrious.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.850
Then, she drew the lesson that we can be industrious like the bees.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.329
In spite of the bend, we can stay busy serving Jehovah.

00:05:49.329 --> 00:05:53.129
Those must be some cherished memories, those lessons like that.

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:59.930
Now, I wonder, at meetings, since the literature was banned, what did you study?

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.410
Usually, there was one copy of the watchtower for the whole group.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:09.529
When the paragraph was read, we would listen and answer the question from memory.

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:13.410
My goodness, you had to pay really close attention at the meetings.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:18.329
Were there ever times when you could get together in larger groups?

00:06:18.329 --> 00:06:26.250
We couldn't have assemblies and conventions, but we could have funerals, weddings,

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.050
this became our assemblies and conventions.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:37.209
Sometimes, a funeral could have as many as 1,000 people, and it could last up to four hours.

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:38.209
Wow.

00:06:38.209 --> 00:06:39.970
Now, what about songs?

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.050
The songbook would have been part of the band literature.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.050
Could you sing songs at your meetings?

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.730
I remember being a child, getting together to memorize the songs.

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:50.769
We enjoyed it.

00:06:50.769 --> 00:06:52.610
It was entertainment for us.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.490
So, you memorized the songs?

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:59.209
So, if someone called out a song number, you could sing the song for memory.

00:06:59.209 --> 00:07:00.209
Yes.

00:07:00.209 --> 00:07:01.209
Yes.

00:07:01.209 --> 00:07:03.730
What was going to school like under band?

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:09.529
Our classmates, our neighbors, all knew we were Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:16.970
Because when under band, we didn't hide our identity as a witness.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:24.930
We just hid things that government outlets, such as meetings, preaching, literature.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:29.889
So you must have been very determined to stay faithful in school.

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:33.370
So whatever happened to the two groups?

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:42.649
I'm happy to say they reunited as one organization in 1988, then the band was lifted in 1990.

00:07:42.649 --> 00:07:44.649
The brothers were overjoyed.

00:07:44.649 --> 00:07:49.129
I can imagine they must have felt a great deal of relief when they could go about their

00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:51.370
spiritual routine without the band.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:52.370
True.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:56.089
But I learned a lesson I never wanted to forget.

00:07:56.089 --> 00:08:00.850
Band or no band, we are always under attack by Satan.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:08.410
I saw brothers that stayed faithful during the band, but fell away once the band was lifted.

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:15.769
As circumstance change, Satan will always look for new ways to attack us.

00:08:15.769 --> 00:08:22.290
So band or no band, we must stay close to Jehovah.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:25.689
Those are profound thoughts, you know.

00:08:25.689 --> 00:08:29.449
Well how is Jehovah blessing the work in Romania today?

00:08:29.449 --> 00:08:33.289
Today there are more than 40,000 witnesses in Romania.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:37.970
Actually, we brought a video that shows what's being done in Romania today.

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:38.970
Did you like to see it?

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:47.580
Yes, that would be wonderful.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:53.980
Jesus said, be on the watch for the false prophets who come to you in sheep's covering.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:58.580
But inside, they are ravenous wolves.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:04.980
During the mid-20th century, government agents in Romania used techniques to infiltrate

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:09.779
the congregation, feigning interest, posing as spiritual brothers.

00:09:09.779 --> 00:09:15.340
They were so convincing that some were even appointed as elders and given very responsible

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.340
positions.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:23.419
Not knowing who could be trusted, a large group of brothers separated from the organization

00:09:23.419 --> 00:09:26.100
that was being used by headquarters.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:30.700
Still, they were really brothers in their heart.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.419
They loved the truth.

00:09:32.419 --> 00:09:38.940
So in 1988, a reunification of about 5,000 was accomplished.

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:44.899
And now that our Romanian brothers and sisters were reunited, they could fully work shoulder-to-shoulder

00:09:44.899 --> 00:09:48.580
in sharing the good news of God's kingdom.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:55.059
This was beautiful time, because conditions in Romania were ripe for accelerated spiritual

00:09:55.059 --> 00:09:56.259
growth.

00:09:56.259 --> 00:10:03.299
In 1999, the band that they had endured for more than 40 years was finally lifted.

00:10:03.299 --> 00:10:10.019
Brother Iwan Florian and Titu Bindu remember the period of fiery tests.

00:10:10.019 --> 00:10:14.419
At one time, Brother Florian was part of the separated group.

00:10:14.419 --> 00:10:20.299
Brother Bindu was always with a congregation that remained with the main organization associated

00:10:20.299 --> 00:10:22.460
with headquarters.

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:26.419
They now served together as elders in the congregation.

00:10:26.419 --> 00:10:31.460
When I returned to Jehovah's organization, I had experienced the most profound and noble

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:37.460
feelings that only someone who belongs to Jehovah's worldwide family could have.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:43.820
Today, they serve in unity and enjoyed many spiritual blessings, like so many other mature

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:50.820
ones with a similar background, their rich history and experience benefits younger ones.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:56.779
In just six years after the band was lifted, the number of publishers nearly doubled.

00:10:56.779 --> 00:11:01.460
Regular pioneers increased by nearly 3,000%.

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:05.500
There are now more than 40,000 publishers.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:10.659
Looking forward, the Romanian branch has began working with the Central European branch

00:11:10.659 --> 00:11:16.779
to form foreign language circuits for Hungarian and Romani-speaking people.

00:11:16.779 --> 00:11:22.340
Recently, a seminar was organized for language instructors.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:29.100
The unity of our Romanian brothers and sisters is making it possible to reach people of all

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.980
languages with the good news.

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:38.860
The cold and the city's tactics of Satan's agents failed to separate our brothers from

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:42.620
Jehovah and each other.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:59.279
And even now, Jehovah is blasting them with a spiritual paradise.

00:11:59.279 --> 00:12:01.639
What a wonderful video.

00:12:01.639 --> 00:12:09.320
Obviously, the brothers in Romania, both the adults and the children, had a lot of courage

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:12.799
and faith to keep their integrity under the band.

00:12:12.799 --> 00:12:15.600
Thank you, Yonotes and Delia for sharing your story with us.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:25.419
Now, let's introduce our next guests.

00:12:25.419 --> 00:12:29.539
From India, we have not two, but four students.

00:12:29.539 --> 00:12:46.779
Please welcome Sarb, and Gita Dillon, and Punit, and Ritu Igerval.

00:12:46.779 --> 00:12:49.259
Well, thank you so much for joining us.

00:12:49.259 --> 00:12:50.259
Thank you.

00:12:50.259 --> 00:12:51.259
Thank you.

00:12:51.259 --> 00:12:57.100
Now you all serve at the India branch, and as I understand, you are in English congregations.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:01.100
Yes, there are several English congregations in India.

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:02.100
Very interesting.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:06.220
So could we start by having you just explain a little bit about the background of the

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.299
work in India?

00:13:07.299 --> 00:13:08.299
Sure.

00:13:08.299 --> 00:13:10.299
The work got started around 1905.

00:13:10.299 --> 00:13:14.379
There was a man called AJ Joseph.

00:13:14.379 --> 00:13:17.100
He had questions about the Bible.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.379
And somebody gave him books of Brother Russell.

00:13:20.379 --> 00:13:23.620
He read those books and came into the truth.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:29.419
And for around 60 years, he proved to be instrumental in establishing the work in India.

00:13:29.419 --> 00:13:34.980
It is amazing how Jehovah used Brother Russell to spread the good news so far.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:35.980
Yes.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:41.899
And in fact, Brother Russell went to India in 1912, and in one village, the villagers actually

00:13:41.899 --> 00:13:47.059
changed the name of the village to Russell Borum, which means a place of Russell.

00:13:47.059 --> 00:13:48.059
Amazing.

00:13:48.059 --> 00:13:49.059
So is it still there today?

00:13:49.059 --> 00:13:50.059
Yes.

00:13:50.059 --> 00:13:53.419
It's in the beautiful state of Kerala, which is in the south of India.

00:13:53.419 --> 00:13:57.539
Now, there are a lot of misconceptions about India.

00:13:57.539 --> 00:14:03.419
Even when you see pictures, you see what appear to be tremendously overcrowded cities.

00:14:03.419 --> 00:14:05.500
But there must be more to India than that.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:06.500
Yes.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.820
Yeah, actually India is a very, very diverse country.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.899
And it's very beautiful country.

00:14:11.899 --> 00:14:16.379
If you go to the north of India, you will have world famous Himalayan mountains.

00:14:16.379 --> 00:14:20.419
If you go to North West, you will find great Indian desert.

00:14:20.419 --> 00:14:24.299
And if you go to South West and Southeast, you will have miles of beaches.

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:29.340
And then in the southern tip of it, we have another natural beauty that's called backwaters.

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.580
These are actually lagoons or lakes.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.500
What a beautiful country.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.019
What diversity.

00:14:37.019 --> 00:14:41.740
And you know the peoples and the cultures are as diverse as the country.

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:44.899
In fact, we have over 700 languages.

00:14:44.899 --> 00:14:46.860
700 languages.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.460
That's amazing.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:49.539
What about religion?

00:14:49.539 --> 00:14:51.179
Is it diverse also?

00:14:51.179 --> 00:14:52.179
Yes.

00:14:52.179 --> 00:14:57.019
A majority of people are Hindus, but there's also Buddhists and Muslims.

00:14:57.019 --> 00:15:02.500
In fact, there are several states in the northeast known as the Seven Sisters,

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.899
where people profess to be Christians.

00:15:04.899 --> 00:15:06.539
How many people are we talking about?

00:15:06.539 --> 00:15:07.820
Millions of people.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.860
So there are millions of people in India that profess to be Christian.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:11.860
Yes.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:12.940
I did not know that.

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:16.340
So what's the situation with Jehovah's Witnesses in India?

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:21.220
Well, we have just under 50,000 witnesses in the whole of India.

00:15:21.259 --> 00:15:26.980
Now, that's a ratio of one publisher for every 27,000 people.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:32.980
Now, what that means is that some 90% of our territory is actually unwirked,

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.860
so the need over there is very, very great.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:38.100
Well, I can see there's an amazing need.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:42.940
You see in those states where the people are or profess to be Christian,

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:47.539
there's actually millions of people that you can speak to about the truth very easily.

00:15:47.539 --> 00:15:51.820
But there's also been an amazing response to the truth in other parts of India too.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.220
Amazing response.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:57.419
Now, what do you mean by amazing response?

00:15:57.419 --> 00:16:01.779
Well, there's been reports of congregations where there's 50 publishers

00:16:01.779 --> 00:16:05.980
where over 850 people have attended the memorial.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:10.179
For example, in places like Kushambi and Allahabad.

00:16:10.179 --> 00:16:13.940
And brothers have been sent into anti-stories, into villages,

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.580
where villagers just came out, sit on ground

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.740
and listen to brothers for others.

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.259
Those are such interesting reports.

00:16:21.259 --> 00:16:22.899
What about you personally?

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:27.139
We what have you personally experienced as far as response to the truth?

00:16:27.139 --> 00:16:30.539
Bruder, when I was a pioneer back in my congregation,

00:16:30.539 --> 00:16:32.779
I find people were very, very nice.

00:16:32.779 --> 00:16:34.179
They're always ready to listen.

00:16:34.179 --> 00:16:37.820
It wasn't difficult to start two or three Bible studies in a day.

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:41.299
And eventually, I came to a point that I couldn't continue house to house

00:16:41.299 --> 00:16:44.220
because I had so many Bible studies.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.620
It's fantastic.

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:49.299
What makes the people so eager to listen?

00:16:49.299 --> 00:16:53.580
Well, the Indian people in general are spiritually minded.

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:57.500
And the majority do believe in the existence of a God,

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.580
or even many gods.

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:03.059
And many people feel downtrodden and overlooked.

00:17:03.059 --> 00:17:05.980
And so they are drawn to the love and respect

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.460
that they experience amongst the brothers.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.900
And especially when they learn about a creator

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.579
who actually loves them and care for them,

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:16.460
it changes their viewpoint towards themselves.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:19.180
And that also helps them to come in truth.

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:24.539
Well, given the need and the response that you're getting,

00:17:24.539 --> 00:17:28.660
can you get help from other places like brothers or publishers

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:30.019
from other countries?

00:17:30.019 --> 00:17:30.980
Absolutely.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.380
In fact, every year we organize special campaigns

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:37.539
to try to cover some of our unworked territory.

00:17:37.539 --> 00:17:39.299
And we have friends come from other countries

00:17:39.299 --> 00:17:41.059
who support these campaigns.

00:17:41.059 --> 00:17:42.779
And how does that work out?

00:17:42.819 --> 00:17:45.940
Well, the friends who come really enjoy themselves.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.619
And they enjoy themselves so much

00:17:47.619 --> 00:17:51.500
that they often come back again for longer periods of time.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.940
So you have need graders in India?

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.019
We do.

00:17:55.019 --> 00:17:56.099
Could you use more?

00:17:56.099 --> 00:17:57.700
Oh, yes, please.

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:01.500
And there is also a growing sign language field in India.

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.220
The Deaf field is one of the fastest growing fields in India.

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.619
For example, a few years ago, there was no Deaf congregations.

00:18:08.619 --> 00:18:11.140
But today we have 13 congregations

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.900
and over 46 pregroups and groups.

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.740
Wow, again, that's amazing response.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:19.980
Well, what kind of sign language do you use in India?

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.740
Is it similar to American sign language?

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.579
No, we have Indian sign language,

00:18:24.579 --> 00:18:27.500
which is very natural and very easy to learn.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.779
Actually, I can help you to learn some.

00:18:29.779 --> 00:18:30.740
You can try.

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:31.740
Yeah, OK.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:34.420
So for sign for women, it's like this,

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.980
because there were no strings.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.980
And for sign for men, it's like this,

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.220
because they have moustaches.

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.099
Not all, of course.

00:18:42.099 --> 00:18:46.380
And then if I just do act like I'm eating a fruit,

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:48.059
so now I'm going to do a sign

00:18:48.059 --> 00:18:51.059
and let's see if you can understand, in guess.

00:18:51.059 --> 00:18:51.900
You give me a test.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.099
Yeah, it's from Bible.

00:18:53.099 --> 00:18:54.220
It's very easy.

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:58.579
So if I do like which Bible correct me?

00:18:58.579 --> 00:18:59.539
Oh, very good.

00:18:59.539 --> 00:19:02.180
And if I do like that.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:02.779
Adam.

00:19:02.779 --> 00:19:04.420
Wow, very good.

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.619
Have on my way to learning Indian sign language.

00:19:06.619 --> 00:19:08.779
Yes, yes.

00:19:08.819 --> 00:19:11.019
And Brother Stovall, the deaf people

00:19:11.019 --> 00:19:14.299
are really drawn to the attention they receive

00:19:14.299 --> 00:19:16.940
in the congregation, because unfortunately,

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:19.579
in the Indian society, they are neglected.

00:19:19.579 --> 00:19:21.579
For example, there was a brother who

00:19:21.579 --> 00:19:25.819
was trying to contact a deaf man to arrange for a meeting.

00:19:25.819 --> 00:19:29.579
So the deaf man asked if he can bring a friend along.

00:19:29.579 --> 00:19:33.380
And when the brothers arrived at his village,

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.299
they found the interested person, the deaf man.

00:19:36.299 --> 00:19:39.299
And not just one of his friends were with him,

00:19:39.299 --> 00:19:46.619
but 136 of his deaf friends had come along with him to listen.

00:19:46.619 --> 00:19:47.700
Incredible.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:52.660
How in the world could the brothers speak to 136 people?

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.740
Well, there was a school nearby,

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:58.619
and so they divided the full group into classrooms there.

00:19:58.619 --> 00:20:03.619
Well, I can see there is a tremendous amount of work

00:20:03.619 --> 00:20:05.420
to do in India.

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:08.339
And we have a lovely video to show it to you.

00:20:08.339 --> 00:20:12.420
A video, let's watch.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:18.079
Have you considered India?

00:20:18.079 --> 00:20:22.240
You may have a list of questions, such as,

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:25.400
is there really a great need in India?

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.119
Here are the facts.

00:20:27.119 --> 00:20:32.319
For everyone witness, there are about 27,000 potential brothers

00:20:32.319 --> 00:20:33.759
and sisters.

00:20:33.759 --> 00:20:36.000
What about the response?

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.160
Those who have moved here are finding

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:42.519
as many progressive Bible studies as they can handle.

00:20:42.519 --> 00:20:45.400
Are you a married couple?

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.480
Are you a single person?

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.319
No matter what your situation,

00:20:49.319 --> 00:20:53.839
the thought of moving to India must raise questions.

00:20:53.839 --> 00:21:00.019
Like, what about the food?

00:21:00.019 --> 00:21:03.380
What about the culture?

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:08.190
How will I get around?

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:13.059
What does it like to live here?

00:21:13.059 --> 00:21:17.900
With some research, the answer may surprise you.

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.900
We all are searching for those rightly disposed

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.859
for everlasting life.

00:21:22.859 --> 00:21:26.220
If you are praying for a fuller share in this work,

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:37.130
ask Jehovah if he will help you step over into India.

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:40.009
What a fascinating view of India.

00:21:40.009 --> 00:21:45.250
So how do you feel as you see the work really taking off

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:46.009
in India?

00:21:46.009 --> 00:21:50.049
Well, there is no doubt that the end is so close.

00:21:50.049 --> 00:21:54.410
And we all feel that now is the time for India.

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:56.210
And therefore, we are very much excited

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:59.849
to see what Jehovah has in store for us there.

00:21:59.849 --> 00:22:04.250
Thank you so much for coming and sharing these things with us.

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:04.970
Thank you.

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:09.809
Thank you.

00:22:09.809 --> 00:22:12.329
How encouraging to hear how our young ones were

00:22:12.329 --> 00:22:14.690
faithful under the ban.

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:18.410
And to see what our brothers in Romania are doing today.

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:20.930
And when you heard those reports from India,

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:23.569
were you not reminded of Jesus' words,

00:22:23.569 --> 00:22:26.130
the fields are white for harvesting.

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:29.089
And as further words, beg the master

00:22:29.089 --> 00:22:32.130
to send more workers into the harvest.

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:35.369
We live in exciting times.

00:22:35.369 --> 00:22:38.210
May Jehovah continue to bless you and your efforts

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:42.009
to serve him until we're together again

00:22:42.009 --> 00:23:01.630
to get the inside story.

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:03.910
Well, that was absolutely delightful.

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:05.349
Thank you, brother Stovall.

00:23:05.349 --> 00:23:08.309
And everyone involved in producing that video

00:23:08.309 --> 00:23:10.910
that we just had the privilege of enjoying.
