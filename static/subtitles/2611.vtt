00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:08.660
I got married in 2002, around that time I was appointed a ministerial servant and my

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.900
wife and I were serving as regular pioneers.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.739
In 2004, we were given the opportunity to serve as special pioneers.

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:24.339
It was something that we really wanted, because we wanted to do more for Jehovah.

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:27.980
So when we got that assignment, we were delighted.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:36.909
The brothers in the congregation were also very happy for us, but everything did not

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:38.310
go smoothly.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.990
As time went on, I faced some difficult situations.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:50.170
The fact that I was not appointed as an elder made me feel disappointed.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.649
In one congregation, two brothers who had served as ministerial servants for a shorter

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.460
time than I had were appointed as elders.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.700
I felt that those brothers did not have as much experience as I had.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.379
I thought, I am the one with the experience, so why didn't I get appointed?

00:01:08.379 --> 00:01:14.659
I started to question my own qualifications, and this made me very sad.

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.939
After the two brothers were appointed, I started to dislike them.

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:27.579
I was also angry with them, and the anger even progressed a little toward hatred.

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:30.819
It was a real challenge for me to serve in that congregation.

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:33.340
At any meetings were difficult.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.939
I would go with a heavy heart.

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:41.900
I put a lot of effort into making personal changes, changing my attitude and getting rid

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.700
of my negative traits.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.900
I knew that if I did nothing, it was going to affect the worship I give to Jehovah, and

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.140
also the relationship with my brothers.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.859
My wife and I could end up completely losing our joy.

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:01.579
In order to make things right, I prayed intensely to Jehovah.

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.739
I spent time in deep personal Bible study.

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:09.139
My wife would also find articles about maintaining peace with the brothers, and would give them

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:10.659
to me to read.

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:14.860
She even selected kingdom songs that dealt with maintaining peace, and she would sing them

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.650
to me.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.650
I made a lot of changes to my attitude and worked hard to progress as a person whom Jehovah

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.650
would approve.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:33.689
I tried to view my brothers the same way Jehovah did, and to serve him with joy.

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:38.289
I really wanted to give my best to Jehovah and to the brothers.

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:47.389
At the same time, I did not want those wrong thoughts to ever come back into my heart.

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:52.189
The valuable lessons that I have learned is that privileges are not more important.

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:56.069
Rather, it is serving Jehovah that brings genuine happiness.

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.629
And now, I am finding real joy and satisfaction in my service to Jehovah.
