00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:06.870
Welcome! Here are a few highlights of this month's program.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.869
During the COVID-19 pandemic, some of Jehovah's people suffered heartbreaking losses.

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:17.870
We'll see how Jehovah's love triumphed over tragedy.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.870
We cherish the rich diversity of our global brotherhood,

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.870
but could our local culture somehow influence our thinking

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.870
and undermine our precious unity?

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.869
And our new music video reminds us that unity not only makes us joyful,

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:38.869
but it makes us strong.

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:43.869
This is JW Broadcasting for May 2022.

00:00:43.869 --> 00:01:08.239
The theme of this year's regional convention is pursue peace.

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:10.239
Here's a preview of the program.

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:17.969
Peace is often defined as the absence of conflict,

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:21.969
but peace involves much more.

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:29.969
The truth is, we each face trials that can rob us of peace, illness,

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:40.109
economic problems, our own weaknesses, damaged relationships,

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:46.310
what threatens your peace.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:54.319
At the 2022 pursue peace convention of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:01:54.319 --> 00:02:00.319
you will discover how you can find real, lasting peace in your life right now.

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:14.050
Our convention theme is so timely.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:21.050
The world is full of conflict and anguish, people long for peace,

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.050
and they long for unity, which is the focus of this month's broadcast.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:34.050
Our theme is, stand together as one united people.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.050
Let me begin with a question.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.050
Where do you keep your wallet?

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.050
If you're out in public, you brothers likely keep it in your pocket,

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:50.050
maybe a front pocket, so that it doesn't get lost or stolen.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.050
You sisters might carry your wallet in a purse or handbag,

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.050
but you keep close by your side.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.050
You guard your wallet, because you know that if you get careless,

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:09.050
a thief might steal it, and you might never see your wallet or its contents again.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:16.050
It is similar with the precious unity we enjoy as Jehovah's people.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:22.050
We need to guard it and protect it, or else someone might steal it.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.050
Make no mistake.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:31.050
The devil is looking for an opportunity to steal our unity from us.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.050
Think about how unique our unity is.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:40.050
Unlike other religious organizations, we're not divided into sub-denominations.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.050
We don't have Northern Jehovah's Witnesses, Orthodox Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.050
or Reformed Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:59.050
As the Apostle Paul expressed it, we are united in the same mind and in the same line of thought.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.050
We are also united internationally.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.050
We don't fight against one another in the wars that divide nations.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.050
And we are united racially.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:17.050
Many times, witnesses have risked their lives to protect their fellow Christians of another race

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:24.050
who were being threatened or persecuted because of their racial or ethnic background.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.050
We are also united in our purpose.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:33.050
For example, no matter where we live, we all preach the same good news,

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:39.050
and we all receive the same weekly spiritual instruction.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.050
Can you find this unity out in the world? Look around!

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.050
People are divided.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:53.050
Nations attack each other, and within nations, political parties fight one another.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.050
Corporations compete with and destroy each other,

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:04.050
and citizens commit racially or ethnically motivated hate crimes against each other.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.050
What a contrast that is with Jehovah's worshipers.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:16.050
We stand together as one united people.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:23.050
Why, though, do we each need to guard and protect our unity?

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.050
Can't we safely assume that Jehovah will protect it?

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.050
And that he will see to it that our unity is preserved?

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.050
Not entirely.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:40.050
Guarding the unity of God's people is a responsibility that Jehovah has given each one of us.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:48.050
We must do our part to ensure that we stand together as one united people.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.050
What will happen if we don't?

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.050
Divisions will occur among us.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.050
Divisions that resemble what we see in the world.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.050
It happened in the first century congregation in Corinth.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:10.050
To them, Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians chapter 1 and verse 11,

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:15.050
There are dissensions among you.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.050
What kind of dissensions?

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.050
Some said, I belong to Peter.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.050
Others said, I belong to Paul.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.050
And still others said, I belong to Apollos.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:34.050
Paul felt compelled to ask at 1 Corinthians chapter 1 and verse 13,

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.050
Is the Christ divided?

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:43.050
What a reproach on Jehovah's name and on true worship.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:51.050
By failing to guard their unity, those early disciples were making Christianity look like just another religion.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:56.050
Could something like that happen in a congregation today?

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:05.050
It could happen if individuals cared more about their own personal preferences, conveniences and opinions

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:10.050
than they do about the unity of Jehovah's people.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:15.050
Selfishness is not the fruitage of Jehovah's spirit.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.050
Rather, it reflects the spirit of the world.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:25.050
The world is aggressively promoting the view that you should put yourself first.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.050
But we have learned Jehovah's view.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:36.050
1 Corinthians chapter 10 verse 24 tells us to keep seeking not our own advantage,

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.050
but that of the other person.

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:46.050
In chapter 13 verse 5, Paul wrote that love does not look for its own interests.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:54.050
And he states at Romans chapter 15 and verse 3 that the Christ did not please himself.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:08:06.050
Therefore, we cannot afford to care more about our privileges, our pride or our opinions than we do about Christian unity.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:14.050
If we put our own wants first, then just like a man who leaves his wallet out in public for a thief to steal,

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:21.050
we place the congregation's unity in plain view for Satan to snatch.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:29.050
And there is no doubt that the devil will seize the opportunity and the congregation will suffer.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:39.049
We need to accept our personal responsibility to guard and protect our unity, not only as a congregation,

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:47.049
but also as field service groups, families, married couples and friends.

00:08:47.049 --> 00:08:57.049
So let's now discuss four areas where we especially need to guard and protect our Christian unity.

00:08:57.049 --> 00:09:04.049
The first is our response to direction from Jehovah's organization.

00:09:04.049 --> 00:09:14.049
When the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020, we all received direction including new ways to attend our meetings

00:09:14.049 --> 00:09:21.049
and carry out our ministry and ways to comply with the secular authorities.

00:09:21.049 --> 00:09:26.049
Did you disagree or did you have a different idea?

00:09:26.049 --> 00:09:32.049
If so, did you follow the direction anyway and give it your support?

00:09:32.049 --> 00:09:37.049
If you did, then you contributed to our unity.

00:09:38.049 --> 00:09:48.049
When we stand together and unitedly follow direction from Jehovah's organization, good things happen.

00:09:48.049 --> 00:09:58.049
Like what? Like what happened when the first century Christians complied with the direction from the apostles and older men in Jerusalem.

00:09:58.049 --> 00:10:02.049
Acts chapter 16 verses 4 and 5 says,

00:10:04.299 --> 00:10:17.299
As they traveled on through the cities, they would deliver to them for observance the decrees that had been decided on by the apostles and the elders who were in Jerusalem.

00:10:17.299 --> 00:10:28.299
Then indeed, the congregations continued to be made firm in the faith and to increase in number day by day.

00:10:28.299 --> 00:10:42.299
Individual Christians and congregations recognized and submitted to the authority of the governing body at that time, the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem.

00:10:42.299 --> 00:10:51.299
Did you note the beneficial results? The congregations continued to be made firm and to increase.

00:10:51.299 --> 00:10:58.299
And that's what happened when you, brothers and sisters, follow the direction regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.

00:10:58.299 --> 00:11:03.299
We experienced significant increases in meeting attendance.

00:11:03.299 --> 00:11:10.299
The attendance for the 2021 memorial reached an all-time peak.

00:11:10.299 --> 00:11:20.299
It is amazing what Jehovah accomplishes when we stand together as one united people.

00:11:20.299 --> 00:11:26.299
A secondary in which we need to protect our unity is culture.

00:11:26.299 --> 00:11:29.299
Jehovah's organization is diverse.

00:11:29.299 --> 00:11:38.299
We love to be introduced to different kinds of food, different styles of dress and interesting customs. How wonderful.

00:11:38.299 --> 00:11:50.299
But what if we started feeling that my race, my tribe, my ethnicity, my culture is superior?

00:11:50.299 --> 00:11:54.299
Can you see how that kind of thinking would divide us?

00:11:54.299 --> 00:12:03.299
To preserve our unity, we need to focus not on how we are different from one another, but how we are the same.

00:12:03.299 --> 00:12:14.299
We are Jehovah's Witnesses first, not African, Asian, North American, South American or European.

00:12:14.299 --> 00:12:21.299
Our people are our spiritual family, our spiritual brothers and sisters.

00:12:21.299 --> 00:12:26.299
Our culture is genuine Christianity.

00:12:27.299 --> 00:12:44.299
When we are willing to adopt Jehovah's thinking that we learn from his word, even setting aside our own personal customs or culture, if necessary, we stand together as one united people.

00:12:44.299 --> 00:12:52.299
We experience what the Bible describes at Zephaniah chapter 3 and verse 9.

00:12:52.299 --> 00:13:06.299
For then, I will change the language of the peoples to a pure language so that all of them may call on the name of Jehovah to serve him shoulder to shoulder.

00:13:06.299 --> 00:13:09.299
How wonderful.

00:13:09.299 --> 00:13:13.299
A third area is personality differences.

00:13:13.299 --> 00:13:24.299
Growing up in this divided world, we may have absorbed some of its sensitivities, but Ecclesiastes chapter 7 and verse 9 says,

00:13:24.299 --> 00:13:28.299
Do not be quick to take offense.

00:13:28.299 --> 00:13:41.299
If a fellow Christian hurts our feelings, we have a special opportunity and obligation to show that we stand together as one united people.

00:13:41.299 --> 00:13:44.299
How can we do that?

00:13:44.299 --> 00:13:48.299
Colossians chapter 3 and verse 13 says,

00:13:48.299 --> 00:13:58.740
Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely, even if anyone has a cause for complaint against another.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:06.740
Just as Jehovah freely forgave you, you must also do the same.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:13.740
Note both phrases, putting up with one another and forgiving one another.

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:21.740
Some imperfections and slights are so small, do they really require formal forgiveness?

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:27.740
Because of our human imperfection, we need to do what Paul says.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:31.740
We have to learn to just put up with them.

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:42.740
For example, maybe a certain family did not include us in a gathering at their home or a brother failed to greet us in the kingdom hall or call on us to give a comment at the meeting.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:52.740
These things may irritate us or even hurt our feelings, but they are not sins that we need to forgive.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:15:00.740
They are mere slights or imperfections that we need to learn to put up with.

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:09.740
On the other hand, if a fellow Christian has actually sinned against us in some way, giving us a genuine cause for complaint,

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:13.740
what does the Scripture encourage us to do?

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.740
Forgive one another freely.

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:21.740
That is what Jehovah does for you and for me.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:31.740
Putting up with and forgiving one another is vital if we are to stand together as one united people.

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:37.740
Our fourth area is how we respond when our brothers are in distress.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:47.740
While coping with the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous lands were hit by other disasters, hurricanes, volcanoes, fires.

00:15:47.740 --> 00:16:01.740
But our brothers also experience other forms of distress like the effects of old age, the loss of a loved one in death, chronic health problems, and the list goes on and on.

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:07.740
What do Jehovah's Witnesses do when we see our brothers in distress?

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:13.740
We immediately come to their aid. We stand together.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:22.740
In this very selfish and divided world, this is not a small thing.

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:26.740
It is not something to take for granted.

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:42.740
Jesus said at John chapter 13 verses 34 and 35 that this deep, unselfish love in action would identify his true disciples.

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:51.740
Therefore, brothers and sisters, as we work hard to stand together in the four areas that we have discussed,

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:59.740
we give powerful evidence that we are true disciples of Christ Jesus.

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:03.740
Jesus knew that unity was vital.

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:10.740
On the night before he was put to death, he was concerned that his disciples would remain united.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:18.740
He prayed at John chapter 17 and verses 20 to 22.

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:44.740
I make requests, not concerning these only, but also concerning those putting faith in me through their word, so that they may all be one, just as you father are in union with me, and I am in union with you, that they also may be in union with us, so that the world may believe that you sent me.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:55.740
I have given them the glory that you have given me in order that they may be one, just as we are one.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:05.740
Obviously, Jehovah answered that prayer. He is teaching us to stand together as one united people.

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:24.740
Therefore, dear brothers and sisters, let us renew our determination to protect our Christian unity by following direction from Jehovah's organization, by valuing Jehovah's thinking more than our own culture,

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:33.740
by putting up with and forgiving one another freely, and by helping one another in times of distress.

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:48.740
By doing so, we will not allow Satan to steal our precious unity. Instead, we will stand together as one united people.

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:59.740
Without question, the COVID pandemic was a time of distress for everyone. Sadly, some of our brothers and sisters lost family members to the virus.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:09.740
How could love be shown to these dear ones in the midst of the pandemic? We'll see how this was accomplished in our next video.

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:18.740
My husband contracted COVID-19. He was brought to the ICU and to this later, he passed away.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:26.740
We were unable to say goodbye. We weren't able to see each other. We were unable to have our last conversation.

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:39.809
My husband and I got sick in the month of March 2020, and then my husband fell asleep in death.

00:19:39.809 --> 00:19:48.809
Isolation can make you depressed. I would say that was the worst time of my life.

00:19:48.809 --> 00:19:57.809
My husband contracted COVID and he was breathing heavily, so I called 911.

00:19:57.809 --> 00:20:06.920
The ambulance took him and on the way to the hospital, his heart stopped.

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:20.000
My bank account was blocked. I had dead. I had COVID, and the landlord gave me a week to leave the house.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:31.000
My husband used to do everything, and now it's my responsibility to be the spiritual head of the family. I needed help.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:39.000
The elders helped me prepare for family worship. That's exactly what we needed at that moment.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:51.000
There were times I felt dejected and weak. The sisters really helped me by showing personal interest.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000
In fact, not a day went by without them calling me.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:05.000
I was feeling tired without strength. I felt helpless, so the friends took care of the entire move.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:13.000
I helped to clean the house and helped me out financially. They were like my arms and legs. They supported me.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000
I felt like my spiritual family was carrying me in their arms.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Everything that my brothers and sisters did for me during that difficult time, the messages, the postcards, the flowers, that shows me the kind of family that I have.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:42.000
That's what the kids really needed to see, that we were not alone, that our friends were there, even though they couldn't be here physically with us.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:55.339
The brothers have encouraged me in so many ways, from letters from pioneer spread all over Italy.

00:21:56.339 --> 00:22:10.339
To video calls, phone calls, and messages, I realized that there will always be someone to hold the uses to comfort me.

00:22:10.339 --> 00:22:18.339
Before I felt weak and powerless, to hold a gave me strength, he helped me by means of the brothers.

00:22:18.339 --> 00:22:26.339
The day after my husband died, I was so surprised when I opened the door, our friends started singing for us.

00:22:26.339 --> 00:22:51.380
At that moment I realized, we're not going to be alone, we have our spiritual family.

00:22:51.380 --> 00:23:01.380
I began to speak to Jehovah more intensely, before I would talk to my husband about everything.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:06.380
Now I share my problems and anxieties with Jehovah.

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:16.380
I've been keeping a little journal of everything that Jehovah has done for us, and I write it down because I want to be able to tell my husband when I say him again.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:24.380
I didn't feel alone at any time, I felt that I belonged to a family that was caring for me and supporting me.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:31.380
I really saw Jehovah's love and the help he gives.

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:37.380
He could do anything to help you feel better when you go into trials.

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:44.380
Saying Jehovah support for me by means of the brothers makes me feel secure, thinking about how he will support me in the future.

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:53.380
I can say that in the future, I am absolutely certain that Jehovah will be with me.

00:23:53.380 --> 00:24:04.380
There's no pandemic, there's no bad situation that will prevent Jehovah to reach anyone when they're going through trials.

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:12.359
Our hearts go out to all who have lost loved ones during the pandemic.

00:24:12.359 --> 00:24:25.359
We are not shielded from time and unexpected events, but Jehovah always helps us to endure hardship, often through the love shown by our brothers and sisters.

00:24:26.359 --> 00:24:29.359
We help each other during crises.

00:24:29.359 --> 00:25:14.660
We also show love in everyday matters, as we'll see in the following video.

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:19.660
Everything I know about Kingdom Hall maintenance, I learned from Brother Hojin Khan.

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:36.259
He encouraged me when I needed a little push, taught me the right way to do things, and continued to teach me with kindness and love.

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:56.700
So when he asked to borrow a ladder, I was happy to lend him mine.

00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:01.700
Here are some things I need. For a lunch today, with the youngs.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.700
What's the ladder for?

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:06.700
Oh, Hojin needs it.

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:11.700
Hojin, how's he doing? I heard something about a cane.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:17.700
Hojin? A cane? No way. He's still as strong as an ox.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:24.700
Maybe. But it seems like... well, you'll see how he's doing.

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:27.700
And don't forget to stop at the store.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:32.700
Hojin? A cane? No way.

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:50.420
Here I come.

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:54.420
Oh, sorry. It's okay. Is everything okay?

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:59.140
I just can't dash down the stairs.

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:02.140
I was on my way to the store and thought I'd drop off the ladder.

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:08.140
Thanks. Just leave it by the garage. It's almost time for lunch.

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:12.140
The gutters can wait. They've waited this long.

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:16.140
Okay, we'll do. Bye. Drive safe.

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:54.240
Gutters?

00:27:54.240 --> 00:28:01.829
Hi, honey. What about lunch? The youngs will be here in an hour.

00:28:01.829 --> 00:28:04.829
I know. I picked up the items you asked for.

00:28:04.829 --> 00:28:09.660
It got me thinking about the neighborly Samaritan.

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:18.630
When we see a knee, we can't be like the priest and Levite who just walked away.

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:30.490
The Samaritan cared enough to stop, examine the knee,

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:42.259
and take the time to help the poor man.

00:28:42.259 --> 00:28:48.269
A man he didn't even know.

00:28:48.269 --> 00:28:51.269
Of course. Work what is good toward all,

00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:56.519
but especially toward those related to us in the faith.

00:28:56.519 --> 00:29:00.519
And I have an idea. Let's not cancel with the young.

00:29:00.519 --> 00:29:04.519
I'll go back and pick up my ladder and tell Hojin

00:29:04.519 --> 00:29:08.519
that I'll come back Saturday afternoon to help him clean out the gutters.

00:29:08.519 --> 00:29:22.710
It's such a blessing to be able to care the needs of our brothers

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:28.339
and feel their loving care for us.

00:29:28.339 --> 00:29:39.250
What do we learn from this dramatization?

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:43.250
When we think deeply about the needs of our brothers,

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:49.250
we'll find many opportunities to show unselfish love.

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:55.250
In this world, people feel unloved and isolated for many reasons.

00:29:55.250 --> 00:30:01.250
We'll see this in the experience of Jessen Senahunun.

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:04.250
Life was simple, I remember.

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:08.250
I am Jessen and I am deaf.

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:12.250
Growing up with this disability was hard.

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:16.250
When I was younger, I saw people laughing and family showing affection.

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:24.609
I just walked around the neighborhood and observed what was going on around me.

00:30:24.609 --> 00:30:29.609
I saw them walking and talking and wondered what that was all about.

00:30:29.609 --> 00:30:33.609
Everything was a mystery to me.

00:30:33.609 --> 00:30:36.609
But one day was a little different.

00:30:36.609 --> 00:30:39.609
I saw children my age having fun.

00:30:39.609 --> 00:30:44.240
And they'd wanted me to play with them.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:47.240
To myself, me?

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:52.380
I can't believe they actually wanted me to be with them.

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:55.380
For once, I felt welcomed.

00:30:55.380 --> 00:31:01.779
And that was how we became the best of friends.

00:31:01.779 --> 00:31:03.779
Time went by so fast.

00:31:03.779 --> 00:31:07.779
We grew up spending time and discovering new things together.

00:31:07.779 --> 00:31:12.779
I was having so much fun with our company that even questionable acts seemed right to me.

00:31:12.779 --> 00:31:15.779
I learned how to smoke.

00:31:15.779 --> 00:31:21.210
They taught me how to drink alcohol to our heart's content.

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:24.210
It felt like it was the best time of our lives.

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:29.210
I thought everything we did was how things were actually supposed to be.

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:49.630
One day, in a deaf search in our area, the witnesses found me.

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:59.529
I was hesitant at first, but they were very kind and friendly.

00:31:59.529 --> 00:32:01.529
They educated me.

00:32:01.529 --> 00:32:08.500
They even taught me how to sign my name.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.500
Eventually, I studied the Bible with them.

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:16.740
I learned different truths from the Bible.

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:21.740
Finally, came to know Jehovah, the only true God.

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:26.740
I learned the things Jehovah liked and disapproved of.

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:30.740
Our Bible study moved me to reexamine the life I lived.

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:36.740
I realized that what I did before wasn't pleasing to Jehovah.

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:39.740
My love for Jehovah grew deeper.

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:44.720
And I knew exactly what I wanted to do.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.720
I started to attend Christian meetings.

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:54.430
I met new friends in the congregation.

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:57.430
The Bible changed my life.

00:32:57.430 --> 00:33:02.430
I gave my all to Jehovah and decided to dedicate myself to him.

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:12.440
It brought me nothing but real happiness.

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:20.619
Now, I am in full-time service, eagerly declaring the good news.

00:33:20.619 --> 00:33:27.690
I was appointed to serve as a ministerial servant in our congregation.

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:40.140
And I was called to volunteer in Bethel too.

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:44.140
I have felt genuine happiness in accomplishing these spiritual assignments

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:47.140
if I wasn't in Jehovah's organization.

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:56.619
To all the deaf out there that haven't had the chance to know Jehovah yet.

00:33:56.619 --> 00:34:01.619
I hope and encourage you to study the Bible with the witnesses too.

00:34:01.619 --> 00:34:03.619
Look at me.

00:34:03.619 --> 00:34:06.619
Before, I wasn't able to read and write.

00:34:06.619 --> 00:34:13.619
I realized that even if we can't hear, we can still have a relationship with the only true God.

00:34:13.619 --> 00:34:19.619
I hope you find the same love and joy as I did under Jehovah's loving hands.

00:34:19.619 --> 00:34:21.619
Jehovah has helped me.

00:34:21.619 --> 00:34:30.690
And for that, I will always thank and love him with all my heart.

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:34.690
If you are deaf and you would like to learn more about the Bible,

00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:39.690
we hope you are watching a sign language interpretation of this program.

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:45.690
And that you'll accept Justin's invitation to study the Bible with Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:55.690
You too can develop an intimate relationship with God and become part of a loving united family.

00:34:55.690 --> 00:35:03.690
As we discussed earlier, our unity can suffer if we allow minor matters to affect us.

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:11.690
In our next video, notice what we can do to set aside such feelings and preserve unity.

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:20.690
Many years ago, I started working at a firm and I helped the sister to get a position at the same firm.

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:29.690
As time went on, I may have come to the wrong conclusion, but I felt that the sister wanted to be in charge.

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:32.690
I didn't feel very happy about it.

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:37.690
A few months later, I was retrenched from work.

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:40.690
I felt very hurt.

00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:47.690
My mother always told me to be the lesser one and just to let things go.

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:51.690
So I kept quiet and I left the firm.

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:58.690
Due to certain circumstances, we changed congregations, so we didn't see each other anymore.

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:08.690
During those years, at meetings or reading the Bible, we are regularly reminded to be forgiving.

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:19.960
It felt to me like a stab in my heart, because I knew we had to apply this counsel.

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:25.960
Being at the convention, every time it made me a bit nervous.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:34.960
Because I basically had to prepare myself, should I bump into her, how I was going to handle it.

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:39.960
It did ruin the spiritual atmosphere of the convention.

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:47.909
Soon after my mother passed away, we had our regional convention.

00:36:47.909 --> 00:36:49.909
I was very emotional.

00:36:49.909 --> 00:36:56.909
I saw the sister standing and I wondered to myself what is going to happen now.

00:36:56.909 --> 00:37:01.909
She came up to me, she gave me a hug and a small present.

00:37:01.909 --> 00:37:10.909
That particular day, I definitely felt relieved and I felt I could now make peace.

00:37:11.909 --> 00:37:21.909
If both of us had applied earlier, the advice given in Colossians 3 vs 13 by being forgiving,

00:37:21.909 --> 00:37:28.909
neither of us would have had to carry this emotional burden for so many years.

00:37:28.909 --> 00:37:38.949
Now I am very happy to say, Mona and I are good friends today.

00:37:38.949 --> 00:37:41.949
We served together in the same congregation as elders.

00:37:41.949 --> 00:37:45.949
And the relationship I have today with Louise is that we are friends.

00:37:45.949 --> 00:37:52.949
But when we transferred it to the workplace, that beautiful friendship began to fade.

00:37:52.949 --> 00:37:58.949
Well, as a builder, I am old school and used to being in charge.

00:37:58.949 --> 00:38:03.949
Perhaps I was too proud, but somebody couldn't come and tell me how to do certain things.

00:38:03.949 --> 00:38:06.949
Since I was a crew leader, I said right from the start.

00:38:07.949 --> 00:38:09.949
So, what is he doing here?

00:38:09.949 --> 00:38:13.949
Does he have any right to an opinion about this?

00:38:13.949 --> 00:38:17.949
So I made sure to push the brother aside completely.

00:38:17.949 --> 00:38:23.949
I can remember that when I entered the kingdom hall through one door and I saw Brother Louise,

00:38:23.949 --> 00:38:29.949
I would look for any possible excuse to avoid him and I wouldn't even say hello.

00:38:29.949 --> 00:38:32.949
Neither of us said hello.

00:38:32.949 --> 00:38:39.949
For me, the internal battle between the fleshly minded person and the spiritual person was a very tough battle.

00:38:39.949 --> 00:38:42.949
It was like that for several years.

00:38:42.949 --> 00:38:46.949
And now I think I wasted time.

00:38:46.949 --> 00:38:53.949
Something that would have helped me to maintain peace and unity with my brother would have been to be obedient to what Jehovah says.

00:38:53.949 --> 00:38:59.949
To what the Bible says, to what we hear at the meetings.

00:38:59.949 --> 00:39:02.949
Sadly, I wasn't obedient.

00:39:02.949 --> 00:39:08.949
The lesson that I have learned from this is that Jehovah is always right.

00:39:08.949 --> 00:39:13.949
In the exact moment when something happens, we should immediately act.

00:39:13.949 --> 00:39:18.949
Carlos Hainmi himself was the one that then stopped me and told me,

00:39:18.949 --> 00:39:21.949
we can't keep going on like this.

00:39:21.949 --> 00:39:26.949
He took a very important step so that we could sort things out.

00:39:26.949 --> 00:39:31.949
To be happy, you have to apply the principles you find in God's Word.

00:39:31.949 --> 00:39:39.949
The words at Romans 14 verse 19 encourage us to pursue the things making for peace.

00:39:39.949 --> 00:39:45.949
What I would have done differently is that I wouldn't have let time go by.

00:39:45.949 --> 00:39:51.949
Instead, I should have sought out the brother more promptly and restored that friendship again.

00:39:51.949 --> 00:39:56.949
Although it's true that you can't recover time, you can recover a brother.

00:39:56.949 --> 00:40:03.949
My relationship once again with Luis is that we are friends and he's a true friend.

00:40:03.949 --> 00:40:10.519
After Cecilia was retrenched, that is, she lost her job.

00:40:10.519 --> 00:40:14.519
She resented her spiritual sister for a time.

00:40:14.519 --> 00:40:17.519
This robbed her of her peace.

00:40:17.519 --> 00:40:22.519
Carlos and Luis also allowed petty differences to divide them.

00:40:22.519 --> 00:40:25.519
The lesson is clear.

00:40:25.519 --> 00:40:29.519
Put up with and forgive one another.

00:40:29.519 --> 00:40:36.829
We delight in the variety of cultures represented in our brotherhood.

00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:45.829
But as we'll see in our next segment, we have to be vigilant not to put our local culture ahead of Bible principles.

00:40:46.829 --> 00:40:50.829
Growing up in Canada, I had a view of what hospitality was.

00:40:50.829 --> 00:40:55.829
Hospitality was, have the brothers and sisters over, get to know them, share a meal together.

00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:58.829
Something that I plan to offer to them.

00:40:58.829 --> 00:41:04.829
I don't think I ever realized how much I had been influenced by my own culture

00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:09.829
and defining when I thought hospitality was.

00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:13.829
Culture has a very big effect on us.

00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:17.829
In our culture, young ones are not trusted very much.

00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:20.829
They are not given responsibility.

00:41:20.829 --> 00:41:24.829
I have seen the effect of the culture inside the congregation,

00:41:24.829 --> 00:41:30.829
especially when the question of giving younger ones more privileges of service or assignments came up.

00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:35.829
When it was discussed among the elders, it would not really be considered.

00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:39.829
And so the desire would be for him to wait a little bit longer.

00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:43.829
To mature a little more, gain more life experience.

00:41:43.829 --> 00:41:45.829
I also thought the same way.

00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:49.829
When I looked back now, I realized that it really wasn't right,

00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:52.829
because Jehovah's thinking isn't like that.

00:41:52.829 --> 00:41:55.829
So when I attended the special convention in Ukraine,

00:41:55.829 --> 00:42:01.829
my view of what hospitality was, changed completely.

00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:04.829
When we get off the plane, all the brothers are there.

00:42:04.829 --> 00:42:09.829
The love were overwhelmed by just the quantity of the brothers are there.

00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:12.829
Their smiles, their expressions.

00:42:12.829 --> 00:42:21.619
As the days went on, it was clear they were just looking for what we needed.

00:42:21.619 --> 00:42:25.619
And it was more than just giving us some food and spending some time with us.

00:42:25.619 --> 00:42:31.619
There were so many other things that they did that covered every one of our needs

00:42:31.619 --> 00:42:35.619
when I'm not sure that their own needs were being covered at times.

00:42:35.619 --> 00:42:40.619
They knew they just wanted to be there, and they'd figure out the rest when they got there.

00:42:40.619 --> 00:42:44.619
And that really impressed myself and my wife.

00:42:44.619 --> 00:42:49.619
I do remember one night getting back to the hotel.

00:42:49.619 --> 00:42:56.619
And we had a moment to just really think about what we'd seen that day.

00:42:56.619 --> 00:43:01.619
And started to ask ourselves if we'd ever gone to the same extent.

00:43:02.619 --> 00:43:07.619
Where I'm from, I feel we tend to stick with what we're very comfortable with.

00:43:07.619 --> 00:43:13.619
I realized that I really had unknowingly been putting limits on hospitality

00:43:13.619 --> 00:43:19.619
because of what I was comfortable with, because of the culture where I grew up.

00:43:19.619 --> 00:43:26.619
Whereas the experience in Ukraine helped me to see that we can break that barrier down so much faster.

00:43:26.619 --> 00:43:31.619
We could definitely feel that this was what Jehovah's U of hospitality was.

00:43:31.619 --> 00:43:37.619
It was about looking for what others need and filling those needs.

00:43:37.619 --> 00:43:43.619
In time, my thinking changed because I realized Jehovah's way of thinking.

00:43:43.619 --> 00:43:49.619
The videos produced by Jehovah's organization and what I watched in them helped my view to change.

00:43:49.619 --> 00:43:56.159
I could actually see what a young brother or a young elder could do.

00:43:56.159 --> 00:44:00.159
In the past, we used to focus on experience.

00:44:00.159 --> 00:44:06.159
I would too, but now Jehovah's viewpoint is more important than just experience.

00:44:06.159 --> 00:44:11.159
Jehovah doesn't only focus on experience, but also on spiritual qualities.

00:44:11.159 --> 00:44:14.159
I came to realize that.

00:44:14.159 --> 00:44:20.159
So after we experienced the special convention in Ukraine and returned home,

00:44:20.159 --> 00:44:24.159
we decided we need to consider this more as a family worship project.

00:44:24.159 --> 00:44:27.159
We realized we did have to make some adjustments.

00:44:27.159 --> 00:44:30.159
We realized we did want to do more.

00:44:30.159 --> 00:44:38.159
So we had to set specific goals to be able to strip away our previous definition of hospitality

00:44:38.159 --> 00:44:42.159
and start extending it beyond what we were comfortable with.

00:44:42.159 --> 00:44:51.159
It takes work to continually break free from the limits that we might set for ourselves.

00:44:51.159 --> 00:44:57.159
And it was something we realized we need to make some changes.

00:44:57.159 --> 00:45:02.159
If we were going to maintain Jehovah's you of hospitality moving forward.

00:45:02.159 --> 00:45:06.159
Of course, the influence of the culture doesn't go away overnight.

00:45:06.159 --> 00:45:09.159
We still need to work hard on it.

00:45:09.159 --> 00:45:14.159
We still have to change because traces of the culture can still be left over.

00:45:14.159 --> 00:45:18.159
But I realized we definitely need to get rid of it.

00:45:18.159 --> 00:45:24.949
Now I'm really pleased to serve with those young brothers to talk with them

00:45:24.949 --> 00:45:28.949
and to see their potential as Jehovah season.

00:45:28.949 --> 00:45:33.949
We can also see that Jehovah is very pleased too.

00:45:33.949 --> 00:45:36.949
Jehovah's overjoyed.

00:45:36.949 --> 00:45:40.949
He's proud to see what those young brothers do.

00:45:40.949 --> 00:45:50.380
Like our brothers in the video, it's good for each of us to do a prayerful self-examination.

00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:57.380
If we always put Bible principles ahead of our local culture,

00:45:57.380 --> 00:46:02.380
we strengthen our precious Christian unity.

00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:08.380
The Internet and other technologies allow the governing body to serve the brotherhood

00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:12.380
in ways not possible just a few years ago.

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:17.380
The tools may be new, but the work is not.

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:22.380
In our next segment, we'll learn what past members of the governing body did

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:28.380
to stay connected with and serve Jehovah's people everywhere.

00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:34.380
The governing body has always felt a keen responsibility to live up to Jesus' command,

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:38.380
feed my lands, shepherd my little sheep.

00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:42.380
Today's technology makes the governing body feel like family.

00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:55.110
But did the worldwide brotherhood in times past enjoy such a strong bond with the governing body?

00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:59.110
Let's go back to January of 1945.

00:46:59.110 --> 00:47:03.110
Brothers and Orren, friends, set out on a tour of Latin America

00:47:03.110 --> 00:47:08.110
that ended up with conventions in North America it took four months.

00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:13.110
The purpose was to visit branches already established

00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:19.110
to organize new branches, to forward the movement of the Kingdom preaching work.

00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:23.110
And service tours often combine supervising operations of the branch,

00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:30.110
giving talks of conventions, dedicating new facilities, overnight visits to remote missionary homes,

00:47:30.110 --> 00:47:34.110
followed by evening meetings with a local congregation,

00:47:34.110 --> 00:47:37.110
all this packed into a few days.

00:47:37.110 --> 00:47:42.110
They provided instruction on a field ministry, how to conduct meetings,

00:47:42.110 --> 00:47:46.110
and also what was taking place in the worldwide field.

00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:50.110
And then they would take time to go out into the field ministry with them.

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:54.110
One such visit included a stopover in Guatemala,

00:47:54.110 --> 00:47:58.110
where they visited a very small congregation of just eight people.

00:47:58.110 --> 00:48:01.110
Their heart was in the preaching work.

00:48:01.110 --> 00:48:07.110
I can speak from my own experience that the missionaries were very close to Brother Norse Heart.

00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:10.110
So after sending them first to Latin America,

00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:13.110
he was eager to see the progress.

00:48:13.110 --> 00:48:18.110
And so he visited them, and then over the years he traveled the world.

00:48:18.110 --> 00:48:21.110
And he visited as many missionary homes as he possibly could.

00:48:21.110 --> 00:48:26.110
He privately met each missionary personally to talk over the challenges,

00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:29.110
to arrange for better accommodations if needed,

00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:32.110
to assess the potential for growth,

00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:36.110
or even to establish a new branch or arrange to purchase new property

00:48:36.110 --> 00:48:38.110
if needed.

00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:44.110
Brother Nor loved the Brotherhood, especially missionaries in branch personnel.

00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:50.110
And he would take an opportunity of a 15 or 20 minute stopover in a train station

00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:58.480
or an airport to give encouragement, or to help them to advance the preaching work.

00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:06.480
Brother Norse had deep concern for the welfare of the brothers in the war-torn countries of Europe.

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:13.480
Brother Nor and Henshel, they traveled to Britain, France, Switzerland, Belgium,

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:18.480
the Netherlands, and Scandinavia in November 1945.

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:22.480
Imagine just a few months after the war ended.

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:24.480
The railroad track was destroyed.

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:26.480
Bridges were destroyed.

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:30.480
So there were no good connections between the cities.

00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:32.480
It was not a tourist travel.

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:35.480
It was really a hard work.

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:41.480
But even this, they did for loving the brothers,

00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:46.480
and helping and encouraging the brothers in these countries.

00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:54.409
After visiting the Friends of War-torn Europe,

00:49:54.409 --> 00:50:01.409
then Brother Nor and Henshel embarked on a very ambitious and extensive 47,000 mile tour.

00:50:01.409 --> 00:50:05.409
They visited some lands where there were fewer, even no witnesses.

00:50:05.409 --> 00:50:08.409
If no branch operated in a country they visited,

00:50:08.409 --> 00:50:12.409
they connected with the local congregations in private homes.

00:50:12.409 --> 00:50:16.409
They attended their meetings, and they accompanied the local publishers

00:50:16.409 --> 00:50:19.409
to the homes of interested ones for group meetings.

00:50:19.409 --> 00:50:23.409
And they often rented venues for public meetings.

00:50:23.409 --> 00:50:28.409
Brother Nor and Henshel went on the streets to advertise the talk that evening.

00:50:28.409 --> 00:50:34.409
And then Brother Nor himself even rode with bicycle parades to advertise his talks.

00:50:34.409 --> 00:50:37.409
And these meetings attracted hundreds of interested ones.

00:50:37.409 --> 00:50:42.409
Even though in one city, there was a threatening note that was received.

00:50:42.409 --> 00:50:46.980
Well, things don't always turn out as planned.

00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:50.980
Brother Nor and Brother Henshel had a service tour of countries in Africa.

00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:54.980
One of those was Nigeria, and they were to give talks at two conventions.

00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:59.980
One of those conventions was 400 miles away and involved a road trip.

00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:02.980
So they got off to an early start at 3.30 in the morning.

00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:05.980
On the end of the trip, they started to have car problems.

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:09.980
Those car problems turned into a ruling 18-hour delay,

00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:12.980
and they realized they weren't going to make the convention.

00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:15.980
So they decided to go back to the branch in Lagos.

00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:21.980
But the return trip took 24 hours to jungle roads and additional car problems.

00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:25.980
They get back to the branch, they take a very brief rest,

00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:28.980
and they're on to the next branch.

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:32.980
Brother Nor loved the brothers and he enjoyed being with them.

00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:38.980
I remember very well how after his concluding talk, he waved to the brothers.

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:44.980
And we in the audience, jug out handkerchiefs and waved back for many minutes.

00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:46.980
But that was not all.

00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:51.980
He and Brother Henshel then went to the railroad station to say farewell to the brothers

00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:53.980
leaving in special trains.

00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:57.980
They called out Al-Feederzane, a good deraise,

00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:00.980
and they stayed there till 10-30 at night doing that.

00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:05.980
They thought not of their comfort, but they thought of the brothers.

00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:10.980
A request to hold a large special meeting in Athens in 1952

00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:14.980
was not granted by the authorities because of religious interference.

00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:19.980
But not wanting to miss an opportunity to encourage the Greek brothers.

00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:22.980
Brother Nor came up with an alternate plan.

00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:26.980
He and Brother Henshel would take taxis to the homes of local brothers,

00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:30.980
where they would give a talk for approximately 20 minutes.

00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:34.980
Then they would go on to another home, even though they risked a rest

00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:36.980
because of meeting together.

00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:40.980
They were able to meet with 905 of our Greek brothers.

00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:43.980
In describing that day, Brother Nor wrote,

00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:48.980
it was one of the most blessed experiences of our lives.

00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:51.980
Brother Franz visited Spain many times, but during the 50s,

00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:53.980
our work was under ban.

00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:56.980
Brother Franz wanted to encourage the local brothers,

00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:59.980
but he was especially concerned for their safety.

00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:03.980
On this one event, Brother Franz and his driver decided to park their car

00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:08.980
near the home of their host, a certain Brother Garcia, who was a mechanic.

00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:11.980
So with the hood of the car open, they asked a neighbor,

00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:13.980
is there a mechanic in the area?

00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:17.980
Of course, he was referred to Brother Garcia.

00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:19.980
Brother Garcia then looked at the car and said,

00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:21.980
your car needs to come into my shop.

00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:25.980
That was the opportunity for Brother Franz to meet his local brothers and sisters.

00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.980
When it was time to walk to the meeting later that day,

00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:32.980
Brother Franz decided to wear the beret and a sheepskin coat

00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:36.980
typical for the area so that he would safely blend in with his brothers.

00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:41.980
Well, these brothers were a very loving and courageous man.

00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:44.980
They worked very hard to keep the brothers and countries

00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:49.980
under ban fired up with zeal, even risking their own safety.

00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:53.980
Brother Franz actually was arrested while meeting with the brothers

00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:55.980
in Barcelona, Spain.

00:53:55.980 --> 00:54:00.980
Well, these schedules they kept, they must have been exhausting.

00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:03.980
If a country under ban was on the eye of January,

00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:08.980
they might pay a visit to government officials to promote legalization of our work.

00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:12.980
Well, in our visit at all of the branches to encourage the brothers

00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:14.980
and he talked with the missionaries.

00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:20.980
But in the 1950s, there was much growth and that proved to be too much for him alone.

00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:26.980
So he decided that it would be appropriate to train some of us brothers

00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:31.980
so that we could assist in that work and see that the shepherding is done

00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:38.320
and that the work in the branches is done in unity.

00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:41.320
On the service tour of Africa in 1963,

00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:46.320
Brother Henshel attended the convention at Gabbana, Liberia.

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:49.320
Suddenly, soldiers invaded the convention.

00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:52.320
They arrested Brother Henshel and others.

00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:57.320
He was mistreated beaten with a rifle but to the point where he thought

00:54:57.320 --> 00:54:59.320
he was going to die.

00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:06.300
But he remained on the scene to encourage and assist the brothers

00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:09.300
to be faithful to avoid compromise.

00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:13.300
And when finally he was released, instead of going home,

00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:17.300
he completed his assignment to visit other branches

00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:23.300
and upon return, never acted the part of a hero or a martyr.

00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:27.300
It was just the cost of doing the Lord's business.

00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:32.300
Well, the headquarters represented us wanted the best for delegates to a convention.

00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:36.300
Brothers Northern Henshel were known to personally inspect venues

00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:39.300
and even negotiate contracts.

00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:44.300
In more recent times, Brother Jaros personally visited hotels

00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:48.300
to make sure that there was a proper standard of comfort and cleanliness

00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:51.300
and he even tested out the beds.

00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:55.300
Brother Nor was well aware of the situation that the brothers were facing

00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:57.300
in the Soviet Union.

00:55:57.300 --> 00:56:01.300
He wrote many letters in which he called on the brothers to live in harmony

00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:05.619
and at the direction of the organization.

00:56:05.619 --> 00:56:09.619
One such letter fell into the hands of the KGB.

00:56:09.619 --> 00:56:10.619
They altered it.

00:56:10.619 --> 00:56:13.619
But when Brother Nor was told about it,

00:56:13.619 --> 00:56:16.619
he drew the brother's attention to the spirit of the letter.

00:56:16.619 --> 00:56:18.619
Because from the spirit of the letter,

00:56:18.619 --> 00:56:23.619
it would be evident immediately whether it was a letter from the organization

00:56:23.619 --> 00:56:25.619
or a forged letter.

00:56:25.619 --> 00:56:27.619
This was because the spirit of the organization

00:56:27.619 --> 00:56:31.619
serves to unite the brothers, not divide them.

00:56:32.619 --> 00:56:35.619
All this attention to the international activity was taking place

00:56:35.619 --> 00:56:38.619
while simultaneously directing the work

00:56:38.619 --> 00:56:40.619
and expansion of World Headquarters,

00:56:40.619 --> 00:56:42.619
handling various legal issues,

00:56:42.619 --> 00:56:46.619
organizing and speaking at conventions throughout the United States,

00:56:46.619 --> 00:56:49.619
Gilead school lectures and graduation,

00:56:49.619 --> 00:56:51.619
annual meeting programs,

00:56:51.619 --> 00:56:55.619
and all the while taking care of their own spiritual well-being

00:56:55.619 --> 00:56:57.619
and that of their wife, if married.

00:56:57.619 --> 00:57:01.619
The next few decades would see even greater growth,

00:57:01.619 --> 00:57:04.619
but greater challenges.

00:57:04.619 --> 00:57:13.130
What beautiful reminders of the efforts our brothers made

00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:16.130
to serve our spiritual family.

00:57:16.130 --> 00:57:18.130
And there's more to share.

00:57:18.130 --> 00:57:20.130
In a future broadcast,

00:57:20.130 --> 00:57:26.130
we'll recall additional ways the governing body has preserved unity.

00:57:26.130 --> 00:57:29.130
Now it's time for our new music video.

00:57:29.130 --> 00:57:33.130
It highlights the many blessings of unity.

00:57:33.130 --> 01:01:50.079
This month's program encouraged us to stand together as one united people.

01:01:50.079 --> 01:01:53.079
At times, we may be isolated,

01:01:53.079 --> 01:01:57.079
but with Jehovah, we are never alone.

01:01:57.079 --> 01:02:03.079
We learn not to allow petty matters or cultural norms to disrupt our unity.

01:02:03.079 --> 01:02:07.079
By building a close relationship with Jehovah,

01:02:07.079 --> 01:02:11.079
Jessen became a member of a loving family.

01:02:11.079 --> 01:02:17.079
We were encouraged to seek opportunities to show unselfish love.

01:02:17.079 --> 01:02:26.650
And we reflected on the many ways the governing body has worked to keep us as a united people.

01:02:26.650 --> 01:02:28.650
In this month's video postcard,

01:02:28.650 --> 01:02:32.650
we go to the island of Newfoundland in Canada.

01:02:32.650 --> 01:02:36.650
A large island at the far eastern coast of North America,

01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:46.650
Newfoundland is an amazing place of unique contrasts in weather, geography, and natural beauty.

01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:51.650
Sister Edith Mason brought the truth here more than a century ago.

01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:55.650
She was a single full-time minister in Nova Scotia.

01:02:55.650 --> 01:03:05.650
In 1914, she resolved to go by herself to preach in Newfoundland where there were no witnesses at that time.

01:03:05.650 --> 01:03:08.650
After much prayer and planning,

01:03:08.650 --> 01:03:14.650
she arranged for the photo drama of creation to be brought here in 1916.

01:03:14.650 --> 01:03:20.650
Over 10,000 people viewed this groundbreaking presentation.

01:03:20.650 --> 01:03:24.650
Some of the early preaching work was done by boat.

01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:33.650
Over the years, the brothers used four missionary boats to cover over 6400 kilometers,

01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:37.650
or more than 4,000 miles of coastal territory.

01:03:37.650 --> 01:03:42.650
After the Second World War, spiritual activity increased.

01:03:42.650 --> 01:03:46.650
In 1945, a branch office was established,

01:03:46.650 --> 01:03:50.650
and the first group of Gilead-trained missionaries arrived.

01:03:50.650 --> 01:03:55.650
The branch office continued to operate until 1981.

01:03:55.650 --> 01:04:00.650
Gilead graduates Bernie and Elizabeth Maylor were assigned to Newfoundland.

01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:06.650
They helped establish a congregation in Bonavista in 1952.

01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:13.650
Today, the Bonavista congregation has 38 publishers and four regular pioneers.

01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:16.650
The need remains great in Newfoundland.

01:04:16.650 --> 01:04:21.650
Almost 30% of Canada's unassigned territory is here.

01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:29.650
When publishers come to help, they enjoy Newfoundland's well-known warm hospitality.

01:04:29.650 --> 01:04:36.650
Our brothers and sisters in the Bonavista congregation send you their love and greetings.

01:04:36.650 --> 01:04:42.650
Earlier, we shared a preview of this year's Pursue Peace Regional Convention.

01:04:42.650 --> 01:04:48.650
Now, we'd like to give you a glimpse of the convention's feature Bible drama,

01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:53.650
Jehovah guides us in the way of peace.

01:04:53.650 --> 01:04:58.650
There is a God in the heavens who is a revealer of secrets.

01:04:58.650 --> 01:05:07.599
And he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what is to happen in the final part of the day.

01:05:07.599 --> 01:05:19.599
The divine dream that Daniel interprets for King Nebuchadnezzar constitutes a prophecy crucial for the lasting peace of mankind.

01:05:19.599 --> 01:05:24.599
Jehovah knows the course of history centuries, even millenniums in advance.

01:05:24.599 --> 01:05:29.599
And as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay,

01:05:29.599 --> 01:05:34.599
so the kingdom will be partly strong and partly fragile.

01:05:37.599 --> 01:05:44.599
History has shown us how every type of human government imaginable has failed.

01:05:44.599 --> 01:05:50.599
It's only Jehovah who has the ability to guide humans to real lasting peace.

01:05:50.599 --> 01:05:55.900
He has led his people in the past.

01:05:55.900 --> 01:06:02.900
So when he prophesies that he'll lead his people to real lasting peace in the future,

01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:06.900
this isn't a prediction. It's a guarantee.

01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:11.900
The peace we seek is certain under God's Kingdom.

01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:22.889
I'd like to share one more reason to be excited about the convention.

01:06:22.889 --> 01:06:30.889
It's my pleasure to announce that we'll conclude the convention with a new original song.

01:06:30.889 --> 01:06:35.889
The song in lyrics are now available on JW.org.

01:06:35.889 --> 01:06:40.889
The governing body requests that all of us practice the new song.

01:06:40.889 --> 01:06:47.889
And if someone needs help to download the song, please give them a hand and practice with them.

01:06:47.889 --> 01:06:54.889
Then together we'll sing out with all of our hearts to Jehovah's praise.

01:06:54.889 --> 01:07:04.889
As we conclude this month's program, please know that we sincerely love and appreciate each one of you.

01:07:04.889 --> 01:07:10.889
From the world headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
