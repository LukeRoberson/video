00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:08.710
Numerous Messianic prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus, including prophecies about his birth.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.710
And your wife Elizabeth will bear you as son.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.399
And you are to name him, John.

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:27.399
How is this to be since I am not having sexual relations with the man?

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:33.399
Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the most high will overshadow you.

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:38.399
And for that reason, the one who is born will be called holy.

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.429
God's Son.

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:51.429
Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, into Judea,

00:00:51.429 --> 00:01:00.590
to David's city, which is called Bethlehem.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.590
Jehovah's Angel appeared to Joseph in a dream.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:11.590
Get up, take the young child and his mother, and flee to Egypt and stay there until I give you word.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:20.510
For Herod is about to search for the young child, to kill him.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:31.989
So Joseph got up and by night took along the young child and the child's mother and went into Egypt.

00:01:31.989 --> 00:01:38.989
And he came and settled in a city named Nazareth, in order to fulfill what was spoken through the prophets.

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:45.670
He will be called a Nazari.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:53.670
The true light that gives light to every sort of man was about to come into the world.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:03.379
These are just a few examples of dozens of Messianic prophecies.

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:09.379
The fulfillment of multiple prophecies reveals who the promised Messiah is.
