Our relationship with Jehovah can start when we're young.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.699
For me, it was the example that other set of putting Jehovah first

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:13.699
and the happiness that came as a result,

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:16.699
as well as being in that sort of environment

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.699
that really helped me to one reach out

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.699
as well as be available for those opportunities.

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.699
And once we do give our life to Jehovah,

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.699
it's amazing to see the blessings that he has in store for us.

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:30.699
But in order to build that relationship,

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.700
we need to read God's Word.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.700
We also need to pray to Him.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.700
The more you get to know Him,

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.700
the more appealing things you learn about Him

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.700
that makes you not want to lose Him as your friend.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.700
I always knew it was the truth

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.700
and that I wanted to serve Jehovah forever,

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.700
but I needed to reassure myself of certain aspects.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.700
So I did some research projects with my parents

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.700
using their creator book and some items from the Bible Teachbook.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.700
After that, it only became more obvious.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.700
And I was certain that I wanted it

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.700
and that I was ready to get baptized.
