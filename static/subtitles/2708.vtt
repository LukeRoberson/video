00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.690
Does God have a name?

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:10.820
The Bible mentions the names of many gods.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.780
The nation's surrounding ancient Israel worship did his name

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.780
Astoreth, Bale, and Molec.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.780
The first century Christians lived among people who worshiped such

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.780
you did his as otomis, hermys, and Zeus.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.780
And the names of those gods are recorded in the Bible.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.780
The Bible acknowledges that there are many gods,

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.780
but the name of one god appears in ancient manuscripts of the Bible

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.780
far more times than the names of all the other gods combined.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.780
If you read modern Bibles, you will still find the names of the other gods.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.780
However, many Bibles have removed the name of the most frequently mentioned god.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.780
The name of that god appears some 7,000 times in the oldest versions of the Bible.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.780
Who is the god whose name has been removed from the Bible?

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:17.870
The first part of the Bible, often called the Old Testament,

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.870
was written in Hebrew and a related language are a make.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.870
In Hebrew, God's name is represented by four letters.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.870
Hebrew is read from right to left.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.870
In English, those four letters are rendered by the consonants

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.870
Y H W H.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:43.849
The original vowel sounds used in God's name are unknown.

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:49.849
But the four letters representing God's name appeared throughout ancient Bible manuscripts

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:56.629
and have been inscribed in many other locations.

00:01:56.629 --> 00:02:00.629
In English, a popular rendering of God's name is Jehovah.

00:02:00.629 --> 00:02:04.629
Another rendering is Yahweh.

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:13.629
Some Bibles use one of these forms of God's name at Psalm 83, verse 18, and in several other places.

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:18.629
A number of other translations, such as the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures,

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:25.710
restore God's name to the locations in which it originally appeared.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.710
Since God had his personal name included in the Bibles of 7,000 times,

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:37.889
he no doubt wants us to know and to use that name.

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:41.889
In the law God gave to Israel, he told Moses to write,

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:43.889
Listen, all Israel.

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:49.550
Jehovah our God is one Jehovah.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:56.550
Jesus quoted that passage from the law, so he obviously knew and used God's personal name.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.550
In one of his final prayers before his death, Jesus said to Jehovah God,

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.550
I have made your name known.
