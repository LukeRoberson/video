00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:10.509
Every year, thousands of people accept the good news and transform their lives for the better.

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:19.170
This is possible because Jehovah blesses the efforts of millions of kingdom publishers around the world.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.609
People like America and Paula.

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:37.579
They face challenging territories, fierce persecution and their own physical limitations.

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.579
But nothing can hold back the good news.

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:51.500
It keeps on increasing and bearing fruit, even in those who couldn't be further from Jehovah.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:59.859
Just like I was.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.859
Growing up, I wasn't really religious.

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.859
What interested me more was getting rich.

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:12.530
In Africa, especially Ghana, many people are poor.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.090
I saw people leaving my community to work overseas.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.090
And after coming back, they had an amazing life.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.090
Like they had everything.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.090
So whenever I saw those kinds of people, I would just stare at them.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:39.370
I think, wow, if that were me coming back home, I would be super happy.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.370
The truth is, I really began to envy them.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.370
I wanted to get a house, build my own house, and buy my own car.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.370
I wanted other people to look up to me and see that I was somebody important.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.370
I was completely selfish.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.370
I was greedy because I was only thinking about myself and how to get rich.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:10.490
Well, greed is what drives injustice.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.490
In Italy, around the end of the 60s and the early 70s,

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.490
crime and corruption were at all levels.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.490
So naturally, there were protests against the abuse of power.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:34.090
I was a young man at the time.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.639
I had a very strong sense of justice.

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:44.639
So when I found out that Jehovah would establish a government

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:50.639
and administration that would eliminate all injustice,

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:52.639
it gave me real peace.

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:57.639
It was one of the things that helped me to draw closer to Jehovah.

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.639
The brothers often spoke to me about Jehovah's love,

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.639
but what drew me to Jehovah the most was his justice.

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:08.639
That was at first, but of course later on.

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.639
I also learned other wonderful aspects of his personality.

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:20.300
I was baptized, and it was really a great blessing to meet my wife, Paola.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:30.460
We always agreed that we wanted to spend our life together in the preaching work.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:38.569
Our first assignment in special full-time service was in a town in the Italian Alps.

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.569
The biggest challenge was how difficult it was to walk in the territory.

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.569
It was something that worried me quite a bit,

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:51.569
because my left leg is affected by polio and I wore brace.

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:57.009
And my crutches limited how much I could do.

00:03:57.009 --> 00:04:01.009
There were some very steep steps.

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:07.009
And some of the roads were accessible only by foot.

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:14.930
When I saw it, I began thinking, well, you know, can I even do this?

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:26.560
It was a real workout, but I was happy to do it because I wanted to share the good news.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:33.740
And sometimes the people who lived there actually listened to you,

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.740
so it was worth all the effort.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:43.800
Every single day I was imagining what my life would be like if I lived abroad.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.800
I was constantly thinking about what I would do when I got there.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.800
Sometimes when I was asleep, I would dream that I was in Europe.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.800
But when I wake up, I was still stuck in Africa.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.800
I was saying, I'm going back to sleep so I can keep dreaming.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:04.750
When I started my journey to Europe, I was around 19 years old.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.750
That was when I crossed the desert.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.750
After sometime traveling, our driver told us the car's out of fuel.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.750
We were frightened because we were in the middle of the desert.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:25.660
We didn't know our way forward or our way back.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.660
It got to a point that we all were running out of food and water.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:41.620
One night, a man who was traveling with us cried the whole night.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.029
And then he died.

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:51.439
So we decided we should bury him.

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:57.189
But after that, we wondered who would be next.

00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:00.189
We spent 22 days in the desert.

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:10.389
But nothing, not even that man's death, was going to stop me from reaching my goal.

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:13.389
I was so determined to get rich.

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:17.990
I didn't even care if it killed me.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.990
We crossed the sea in a tiny boat.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.430
I didn't even know how to swim.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:31.279
I was just praying that God would help us to arrive safely.

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:47.629
There were days when I woke up with, I don't know, a pain in my back or other parts of my body.

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:54.629
And it wasn't easy because often we would receive assignments in mountainous areas of Italy.

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:57.629
Or some that involved a lot of hiking.

00:06:57.629 --> 00:07:01.629
And I thought to myself, well, what's this all about?

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:03.629
I've got a bit of a problem.

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:08.629
Why am I here in an assignment like this?

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:13.699
But he said to me,

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:17.699
My undeserved kindness is sufficient for you.

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:21.699
For my power is being made perfect in weakness.

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:28.910
For when I am weak, then I am powerful.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.480
What a beautiful verse.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.480
In the end, where tools in Jehovah's hands.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:42.480
And to Jehovah, it doesn't matter if the tool has some dent or some kind of imperfection.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.480
What matters to Jehovah is that we allow him to use us.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:52.480
And in this way, we become useful tools who are able to carry out his purpose.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:08:00.509
What an incredible privilege it is.

00:08:00.509 --> 00:08:03.509
It's something marvelous.

00:08:03.509 --> 00:08:13.990
I was so happy when I made it across the sea and finally arrived in Europe.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:17.990
But quickly, I became disappointed.

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:22.990
I saw that money doesn't grow on trees as they made me believe.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:30.660
Everything they told us back in Ghana and the end, it wasn't true.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.659
It was all lies.

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:34.659
They exaggerated about everything.

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:36.659
I was barely making any money.

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:42.659
So I started hanging around with some people who were selling drugs.

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:47.769
That was when eventually I started to sell some drugs too.

00:08:47.769 --> 00:08:53.620
As time went by, my business grew because people were buying for me.

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:57.059
Things were going well.

00:08:57.059 --> 00:08:59.059
And I was making money.

00:08:59.059 --> 00:09:08.350
I wanted to send this picture to my family in Ghana for them to see that things were getting better for me.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:13.169
I bought a nice car.

00:09:13.169 --> 00:09:15.169
I was building my house.

00:09:15.169 --> 00:09:17.169
I was getting married.

00:09:17.169 --> 00:09:19.169
I was a young man.

00:09:19.169 --> 00:09:21.169
That's all you need.

00:09:21.169 --> 00:09:25.169
So I thought, when you have all these things, you're good to go.

00:09:25.169 --> 00:09:27.169
That's what life's all about.

00:09:27.169 --> 00:09:34.299
Until one day, everything changed.

00:09:34.299 --> 00:09:39.309
There was night time.

00:09:39.309 --> 00:09:40.309
I was asleep.

00:09:40.309 --> 00:09:42.309
And I heard someone knocking on my door.

00:09:42.309 --> 00:09:47.309
I thought, at this time of night, and it was the police fully armed.

00:09:47.309 --> 00:09:52.309
There was nothing I could do about the charges that were raised against me.

00:09:52.309 --> 00:09:55.309
They had proof of everything.

00:09:55.309 --> 00:09:59.309
I was placed in a cell far away from everyone else.

00:09:59.309 --> 00:10:02.309
So I couldn't even talk to anyone.

00:10:02.309 --> 00:10:04.309
There was no one to help me.

00:10:04.309 --> 00:10:10.309
I had no one, apart from my wife, who would visit when she could.

00:10:10.309 --> 00:10:15.379
I was hopeless.

00:10:15.379 --> 00:10:22.379
Because of a series of accidents that have happened to me in the last few years,

00:10:22.379 --> 00:10:26.379
well, I guess my legs got even weaker.

00:10:26.379 --> 00:10:35.990
From that moment on, I've had to use the chair.

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:38.990
I can't do what I used to.

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:51.820
But when I focus on what Jehovah is asking me to do,

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.820
my own problems become much smaller.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:11:00.820
And after a day in the ministry, you look back and it gives you this incredible feeling

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:06.740
as if you have been flying.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:11.740
But those hoping in Jehovah will regain power.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.740
They will soar on wings like eagles.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.740
They will run and not grow weary.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:23.659
They will walk and not tire out.

00:11:23.659 --> 00:11:26.659
I have the privilege of preaching in prisons.

00:11:26.659 --> 00:11:29.659
The fact that you can still share the good news.

00:11:29.659 --> 00:11:32.659
It gives you a sense of peace.

00:11:32.659 --> 00:11:37.659
And you feel privileged to have shared something so meaningful with another person.

00:11:37.659 --> 00:11:46.669
And over time, you see them make changes and they too begin to fly

00:11:46.669 --> 00:11:50.669
because they overcome the problems they're facing.

00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:52.669
Well, it's wonderful.

00:11:52.669 --> 00:11:57.669
I began to understand what it really means to regret.

00:11:57.669 --> 00:12:01.669
So I wanted to change my life around for good.

00:12:01.669 --> 00:12:03.669
But who was going to help me?

00:12:03.669 --> 00:12:06.669
It was only God I could ask.

00:12:06.669 --> 00:12:10.669
I asked for a copy of the Bible and they gave it to me.

00:12:10.669 --> 00:12:12.669
I was reading it.

00:12:12.669 --> 00:12:17.669
And one day I read Psalm 103.

00:12:17.669 --> 00:12:24.460
And that Psalm really touched my heart.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:29.460
As far off as the sunrise is from the sunset,

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:34.460
so far off from us, he has put our transgressions.

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:37.460
As a father shows mercy to his sons,

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:42.740
Jehovah has shown mercy to those who fear him.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:49.149
For he well knows how we are formed, remembering that we are dust.

00:12:49.149 --> 00:12:56.360
I came to realize that everything I had done,

00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:00.360
all the sins I had committed, God could actually forgive me for them.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:09.220
I was thinking the sunset on the water,

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:13.220
it's kind of like the light of truth shining on our life.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.220
Yeah, beautiful.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:18.220
The power of the good news.

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:22.220
It's really, my life has been transformed.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:29.220
Like when a caterpillar changes into a beautiful butterfly.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:30.220
You know, Paulo?

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.220
Yeah.

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:37.220
I remember the first day I met you when you came to visit the prison.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.220
I was so happy.

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:43.220
From that point, when we started our Bible study,

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:48.220
you have always been like a father to me.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:54.220
And I will never forget all the hard work

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:57.220
and sacrifices you made for me.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:02.220
And Freddie, one thing that I really appreciated

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.220
is how you were able to help your family.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.220
Yeah.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.139
Do you see this photo?

00:14:08.139 --> 00:14:09.139
Yeah.

00:14:09.139 --> 00:14:13.139
Paulo was the one who went to the hospital and took this photo.

00:14:13.139 --> 00:14:14.139
Really?

00:14:14.139 --> 00:14:15.139
Yeah.

00:14:15.139 --> 00:14:17.139
And he brought it to me in prison.

00:14:17.139 --> 00:14:19.139
I really need to thank him then.

00:14:19.139 --> 00:14:21.649
Yeah.

00:14:21.649 --> 00:14:25.649
After I was released, I was looking forward to seeing you grow up

00:14:25.649 --> 00:14:28.649
and choose a different path than the one I took.

00:14:28.649 --> 00:14:32.649
You know, Rubin, when you were very small, just a little baby,

00:14:32.649 --> 00:14:36.649
I always took you with me to the meetings.

00:14:36.649 --> 00:14:38.649
Your mom wasn't a witness back then,

00:14:39.649 --> 00:14:41.649
but I never left you at home.

00:14:41.649 --> 00:14:43.649
Your mom will prepare your milk.

00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:46.649
I would take a few diapers and put everything in the bag.

00:14:46.649 --> 00:14:50.649
I'd pick you up and take you to the meeting.

00:14:50.649 --> 00:14:52.649
Literally, I know that something so good

00:14:52.649 --> 00:14:54.649
would come from all that effort.

00:14:54.649 --> 00:14:58.649
I never thought that things would turn out this way.

00:14:58.649 --> 00:15:01.649
At one day, you and I would be serving Jehovah together.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:10.070
Now, I see that Jehovah was listening to all my prayers.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:28.899
Apollo, you plan at one seed, and now look,

00:15:28.899 --> 00:15:33.899
all my family, we're all happily serving Jehovah together.

00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:40.899
My wife, my daughter, her husband,

00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:46.070
my grandson, and my son, Rubin.

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:51.799
I'm so grateful that Jehovah has done all of this for me.

00:15:51.799 --> 00:15:57.210
Fred, I really appreciate all your efforts.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:00.210
I have seen the power the Scriptures have on people.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:03.210
I've seen the power they had on you.

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:05.210
Yeah, little by little.

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:09.210
Even now, I'm still making many changes.

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:12.210
I'm a work in progress.

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:15.210
Me too.

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:17.210
Me too.

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:20.210
I know how the good news is bearing fruit

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:22.210
and increasing in my life.

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:24.210
And it's having the same effect,

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:28.210
even in lands where the kingdom preaching has been opposed.

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:42.899
My family came to settle in the country of Georgia.

00:16:42.899 --> 00:16:46.899
So growing up in a culture different to my own,

00:16:46.899 --> 00:16:52.460
I never felt like I really fit in.

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:56.460
But I remember when I attended a meeting for the first time.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:00.460
It was an amazing feeling because when I walked in,

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:03.460
I was immediately accepted as if I were a member of the family.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.460
It was like being with old friends.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:09.460
They welcomed me with so much warmth and love.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:22.069
And then the persecution started in Georgia.

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:26.069
I wasn't baptized then, but I could see with my own eyes

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:31.069
exactly what Jesus had foretold that his people would be persecuted.

00:17:31.069 --> 00:17:38.470
During a meeting, a religious group broke in

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:42.470
and started to beat the brothers and sisters furiously.

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:55.930
They lit a fire and burned the literature in front of us.

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:57.930
The police did nothing.

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:05.730
We felt defenseless and vulnerable.

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:15.029
After the first attack, then there were more.

00:18:15.029 --> 00:18:20.539
We even faced aggression from householders.

00:18:20.539 --> 00:18:25.490
Despite the fact that there were so many attacks,

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:37.440
what was really amazing was seeing how the brothers and sisters looked after each other.

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.440
Come in. It's so good to see you too.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.440
Nina was my Bible teacher.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.440
She helped me understand the truth.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:49.509
You know what I remember?

00:18:49.509 --> 00:18:53.509
Back when I was an unbaptized publisher, we were preaching together.

00:18:53.509 --> 00:18:56.509
We had just started the ministry that day.

00:18:56.509 --> 00:18:58.509
On one of the floors in the building,

00:18:58.509 --> 00:19:01.509
I don't remember which floor a woman rushed out with a mop.

00:19:01.509 --> 00:19:03.509
I know, I remember that.

00:19:03.509 --> 00:19:05.509
And she was trying to beat us with it.

00:19:05.509 --> 00:19:08.509
But do you remember? You protected me.

00:19:08.509 --> 00:19:11.509
I was just thinking about that a couple of days ago.

00:19:11.509 --> 00:19:13.509
Yeah.

00:19:13.509 --> 00:19:17.509
It was something that happened so often.

00:19:17.509 --> 00:19:20.509
It was a really difficult time.

00:19:20.509 --> 00:19:25.509
There was a moment when I thought I couldn't continue because I was afraid.

00:19:25.509 --> 00:19:31.509
But you know, then I felt such strong support from our brotherhood.

00:19:31.509 --> 00:19:34.509
I was so happy to see your baptism day.

00:19:34.509 --> 00:19:35.509
Yeah.

00:19:35.509 --> 00:19:37.509
We were always like one big family.

00:19:37.509 --> 00:19:40.509
Yeah. It's true.

00:19:40.509 --> 00:19:44.509
Our brothers needed courage.

00:19:44.509 --> 00:19:48.509
What was happening in Georgia was extreme.

00:19:48.509 --> 00:19:53.920
There was this breakaway group of fanatic orthodox.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.920
And they had the full support of the church and the government.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:05.920
Our assignment was to find some legal means to put an end to the campaign of violence

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.920
that had started against the brothers.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:09.920
We went to court.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:15.920
And in one case, while they're just getting ready for the court hearing,

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:22.920
the whole mob comes and begins attacking those in attendance.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:28.859
The judge did nothing.

00:20:28.859 --> 00:20:35.859
In fact, they wanted to present this as a fight between extremist groups.

00:20:35.859 --> 00:20:42.759
It was ridiculous.

00:20:42.759 --> 00:20:46.759
No weapon formed against you will have any success.

00:20:46.759 --> 00:20:51.759
And you will condemn any tongue that rises up against you in the judgment.

00:20:51.759 --> 00:20:53.759
Well, we are Jehovah's people.

00:20:53.759 --> 00:20:55.759
We are like a nation.

00:20:55.759 --> 00:21:00.759
And there is nothing, no force or power that will be able to stop us.

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:06.759
And as we continue doing his will, Jehovah is always with us.

00:21:06.759 --> 00:21:10.759
Despite all those difficulties, everyone was so active.

00:21:10.759 --> 00:21:14.759
Like, pretty much all the young ones in the hall were pioneering.

00:21:14.759 --> 00:21:18.759
We used to get together and share our experiences and encourage each other.

00:21:18.759 --> 00:21:20.759
Do you remember?

00:21:20.759 --> 00:21:24.759
After we were huddled around the heater.

00:21:24.759 --> 00:21:28.759
During that time, I remember also that we'd have to push in casual clothes

00:21:28.759 --> 00:21:30.759
and not carry a service bag.

00:21:30.759 --> 00:21:34.759
We'd get a plastic shopping bag and put the literature inside it

00:21:34.759 --> 00:21:39.759
and then take it to service because we didn't want to draw attention to ourselves.

00:21:39.759 --> 00:21:42.759
And we had to have the meeting secretly.

00:21:42.759 --> 00:21:45.759
Just a few people would gather together.

00:21:45.759 --> 00:21:49.759
But of course, the growth didn't stop.

00:21:49.759 --> 00:21:53.759
I saw for myself that the congregations were increasing.

00:21:53.759 --> 00:21:56.759
And a lot of people were learning the truth.

00:21:56.759 --> 00:22:02.759
In fact, despite the persecution, my sisters, my mother, my brother,

00:22:02.759 --> 00:22:05.759
even cousins and aunts got baptized.

00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:13.029
Just from one person, now there are so many of you in the truth.

00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:18.029
You are enough to fill a congregation, one big family.

00:22:18.029 --> 00:22:22.500
The truth was really just blossoming.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:28.500
And the Georgian people reacted very well to the preaching work.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:35.500
Satan could see the growth and he had a ready tool to try to stop it.

00:22:38.069 --> 00:22:43.069
Police assisted the mob to attack conventions.

00:22:43.069 --> 00:22:48.069
And there were many, many, many attacks during that time period.

00:22:48.069 --> 00:22:51.069
You could not even have a convention.

00:22:51.069 --> 00:22:53.069
It was too dangerous.

00:22:53.069 --> 00:22:59.069
Pretty well every weekend, you had a mob attack on a congregation.

00:22:59.069 --> 00:23:03.069
Children as young as seven were attacked and beaten.

00:23:03.069 --> 00:23:06.069
It was just relentless.

00:23:06.069 --> 00:23:12.069
You know, when they attacked our congregation, it was a terrifying moment.

00:23:12.069 --> 00:23:18.670
And I remember you had blood all over your face.

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:23.670
They dragged me into a crowd and the women were pulling my hair.

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:25.670
I had long hair then.

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:32.670
I remember one tall man took off his belt and began hitting us on the head.

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:40.099
I asked Jehovah, how do I escape this?

00:23:40.099 --> 00:23:49.779
In that moment, you get this feeling of fear that you might not make it out alive.

00:23:49.779 --> 00:23:52.779
We could never tell the brothers, you know, don't worry, you know,

00:23:52.779 --> 00:23:54.779
in the next couple of years it will be over.

00:23:54.779 --> 00:23:55.779
We could not know.

00:23:55.779 --> 00:23:58.779
It was hard for them, but they simply continued.

00:23:58.779 --> 00:24:05.589
It did not deter them at all.

00:24:05.589 --> 00:24:08.589
Our brothers behaved exceedingly well.

00:24:08.589 --> 00:24:13.869
A nationwide witness was being given.

00:24:13.869 --> 00:24:23.910
And so Satan's tactic to crush the brothers did the opposite.

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:28.910
People began to have so many questions about why we were being attacked.

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:35.910
And of course, we were able to use this as an opportunity to share our beliefs and give a witness.

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:40.910
When Jehovah stands by you, along with Jesus and all their armies,

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:47.910
no opposer will be able to stop the work that Jehovah and Jesus are directing.

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:53.349
And then all of a sudden there was a change in government,

00:24:53.349 --> 00:24:57.349
and the new government did not allow the mob attacks.

00:24:57.349 --> 00:25:01.349
They took the ring leaders and arrested them.

00:25:01.349 --> 00:25:06.349
But that's not a final solution because another government could take another position.

00:25:06.349 --> 00:25:12.349
The ultimate goal was to get some decisions from the European Court

00:25:12.349 --> 00:25:16.349
that would have a lasting effect in the country.

00:25:16.349 --> 00:25:19.349
It's a lot of work to put that together.

00:25:19.349 --> 00:25:26.349
And over the next several years, our job was to gather evidence, prepare petitions,

00:25:26.349 --> 00:25:30.349
file them with the court, prepare the witnesses to testify,

00:25:30.349 --> 00:25:34.349
and eventually, along with cases from other countries,

00:25:34.349 --> 00:25:43.460
we could bring it to the European Court.

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:50.980
Their decisions were very, very strong.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:26:00.619
We were given freedom to preach, to have our meetings, and even conventions.

00:26:00.619 --> 00:26:10.809
And the special convention in 2018 was a huge victory for us.

00:26:10.809 --> 00:26:13.809
When we met our brothers from other countries,

00:26:13.809 --> 00:26:17.809
they said that the whole world had been praying for us.

00:26:17.809 --> 00:26:22.500
And it suddenly dawned on us.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:28.500
We realized nothing can stop the good news.

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:36.700
With Jehovah's help, I can fight with Jehovah's help I can win.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.700
We are the victors. We win.

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:44.700
We courageously stay with Jehovah God and His people.

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:48.700
It was an amazing feeling being there.

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:52.700
I just couldn't hide my joy.

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:56.700
America, who would have thought that everything would have turned out like this?

00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:00.700
From the persecution we faced to what we can do now?

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:04.700
I know. I thank Jehovah every day for that.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:09.700
I feel so grateful. And you know, I just want to say thank you.

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:12.700
For all you've done to help me learn the truth.

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:17.240
Oh, thank you, America.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:21.240
Where would we be without the good news?

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:28.140
The good news transforms lives.

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.420
It gives us meaning.

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.420
It makes us better people.

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:37.420
And even if it's difficult,

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:40.420
if our health limits us.

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:43.420
If persecutors try to stop us,

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:49.769
if the changes our students need to make seem impossible,

00:27:49.769 --> 00:27:54.769
Jehovah will help us to never give up

00:27:54.769 --> 00:27:58.769
and sharing the good news.
