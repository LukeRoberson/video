00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:18.780
But in my heart, it became like a burning fire.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.780
Wow!

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.780
Jeremiah spoke with boldness.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.780
Have you ever wanted to tell someone about Jehovah?

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.780
But we're afraid?

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.780
Lots of felt that way.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.780
Even the Prophet Jeremiah.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.780
In Jeremiah's day,

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.780
God's people were doing bad things.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.780
Jehovah sent Jeremiah to tell them to stop.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.780
But Jeremiah said,

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.780
I am just a boy.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.780
Because inside, he felt he couldn't do it.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.780
So Jehovah promised him,

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.780
do not be afraid because of their appearance.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.780
For I am with you to save you.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.780
For many years,

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.780
Jeremiah relied totally on Jehovah

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.780
and spoke with boldness.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.780
But it wasn't always easy.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.780
This is pasture,

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.780
a priest who wanted Jeremiah to stay quiet.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.780
He had him locked up for a whole night to scare him.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.780
And it almost worked.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.780
Jeremiah wanted to quit being Jehovah's Prophet.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.780
But he loved Jehovah,

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.780
like a fire in his heart that he couldn't keep in.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.530
And he loved people.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.530
When they listened,

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.920
it made Jeremiah happy.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.920
Jehovah's friends rely on him

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.920
and speak with boldness,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.920
just like Jeremiah did.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.920
Why not read more of his story

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.920
and learn about other challenges he faced?

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.620
Make time every day to learn from Jehovah's friends.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.620
What do you think?

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.620
How did Jeremiah become Jehovah's friend?

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.620
Who do you want to talk to about Jehovah?

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.620
What can you say to help them

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.620
become Jehovah's friend?
