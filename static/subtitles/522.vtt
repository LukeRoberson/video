00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:08.460
A discussion of riches often centers on the danger of making material wealth the main

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.820
thing in our life.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:19.179
Our text today is about riches, but the focus is on how we use the things that we possess.

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:24.300
Let's go back to our text at Luke chapter 16, verse 9, and read it once again.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.019
It says, also, I say to you, make friends for yourselves by means of the unrighteous

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:38.219
riches so that when such fail, they may receive you into the everlasting dwelling places.

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.619
There are certain aspects of this text that some have found difficult to understand.

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:52.899
For example, why would a Christian even be in possession of unrighteous riches?

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.420
Who are referred to by the pronoun they?

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.619
Also what application is there in this illustration for us?

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:06.980
To clarify matters, it will help us to look at the context.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.980
Verses 1 through 8 of Luke chapter 16 contain the illustration of the steward and unrighteous

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.500
riches.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.620
Verses 9 to 13 provide the application of the illustration.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.780
And that application includes the principles that the person faithful in least is faithful

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.099
in much, and also we cannot slave for God and for riches.

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:39.540
To learn how we can benefit from this teaching of Jesus, let's consider three things.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.140
First of all, we will examine the illustration.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:52.500
Second, we will identify the elements, and third, we'll make the application.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.299
So first of all, let's examine the illustration.

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.299
If we look at Luke chapter 16, verse 1, it talks about a steward.

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:05.219
If we look at the footnote, it says this could be a house manager, so it is someone who's

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.939
entrusted with a good deal of responsibility.

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:15.979
And it says that he is accused of handling his master's goods wastefully.

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:22.460
Now the wording of that verse allows for the possibility that the steward was slandered.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.500
It's possible the charges were false.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.460
But Jesus doesn't focus on the reason for the steward's dismissal.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.780
Rather, he gives attention to the steward's reaction.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.139
Jesus's 2-7 shows the reasoning of the steward knowing that he's going to be fired.

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:47.180
He says, I'm not strong enough to dig, I'm ashamed to beg, so how am I going to make

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.580
a living?

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.500
So he decides to be friend ones who owe things to his master.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:01.099
One debtor owes 100 measures of olive oil, so the steward reduces that debt to 50 measures.

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:06.740
That's a reduction of nearly 300 gallons of olive oil.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.419
Another debtor owes his master 100 large measures of wheat.

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:12.780
He reduces that to 80.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.180
That's a reduction of 4,000 quarts of wheat.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.939
That's a substantial reduction in the debt.

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:25.379
Then if we look at verse 8, the master, on finding out what the steward is done, calls

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:32.819
him unrighteous, and yet he commends him for acting with practical wisdom.

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:38.740
So here Jesus is not condoning or endorsing the steward's methods.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.699
Nor is he encouraging crafty business practices.

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:51.740
Jesus simply draws attention to the need to be far-sighted and to use practical wisdom.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.300
Now let's identify the elements.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:02.139
We come to our text verse 9, where it tells us to use our unrighteous riches to make friends.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.219
Jesus doesn't explain in detail why he refers to the riches as unrighteous.

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:14.659
However, the new international version gives us a hint when it calls the unrighteous riches

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:17.500
worldly wealth.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:24.500
In other words, the unrighteous riches represent material resources under the control of sinful

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.660
humans.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:33.300
These often serve selfish ends, and they may be gained through crafty or even illegal

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.300
business practices.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.500
Then Jesus states a reality.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:45.939
He says, when such fail, yes, the value of material wealth is limited and it's temporary.

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:49.060
It can be eaten away by inflation.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.819
Consider the value of one U.S. dollar 50 years ago.

00:04:54.819 --> 00:05:05.060
If you had $100 in 1969, you would need $692 today to have the same purchasing power.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:11.220
In 1969, a gallon of gas costs 32 cents, a loaf of bread costs 23 cents.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.740
Yes, riches fail, and they will definitely fail in the future.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.819
Verse 18 says, neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them in the

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:26.100
day of Jehovah's fury.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.779
During the Great Tribulation, we're not going to be judged based on the size of our bank

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:32.779
account.

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:38.500
Rather, we're going to be judged based on our storehouse of spiritual riches that we

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:45.540
have accumulated, and that leads to the meaning of the latter part of verse 9.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:51.660
It says that they may receive you into the everlasting dwelling places.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:57.779
What or who is referred to by the word they?

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:59.660
Is it the riches?

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.819
Certainly not.

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:01.819
They're temporary.

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:03.500
They're going to fail.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:10.339
We have to go back earlier in the verse to find the antecedent, and it is the word friends.

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:12.860
So who are these friends?

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:18.100
Please open your Bibles to John chapter 3, verse 16.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:25.060
There are only two possibilities of individuals who can give us everlasting dwelling places,

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.220
and they're identified here in this verse, John chapter 3, verse 16.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:36.740
It says, for God loved the world so much that He gave His only begotten Son so that everyone

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:43.579
exercising faith in Him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.

00:06:43.579 --> 00:06:52.860
Yes, only God, Jehovah and His Son, Jesus Christ, can usher us into everlasting dwelling

00:06:52.860 --> 00:07:00.100
places, whether that be the heavenly kingdom or the paradise earth.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:05.459
Now let's make application of this illustration.

00:07:05.459 --> 00:07:13.300
How do we use the material things of this world to make friends with Jehovah and Jesus?

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:18.980
Everything we own actually belongs to them, however each one of us has a measure of money

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:24.459
and material assets that we are free to use as we please.

00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:30.339
So to make friends with Jehovah and Jesus, we have to use those things in a way that brings

00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:32.699
their approval.

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:36.259
Our contributions don't have to be in the form of cash.

00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:40.139
In Jesus' illustration, the debt was olive oil and wheat.

00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:43.939
The unrighteous riches might even be coconuts.

00:07:43.939 --> 00:07:47.180
A brother in southern India owns a coconut farm.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:53.300
He contributed a large number of coconuts to a local to the local remote translation office.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:58.420
He reasoned the office is going to have to spend money and buy coconuts so His supplying

00:07:58.459 --> 00:08:04.420
the coconuts directly would help His contribution go further than it would if He sold the coconuts

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:10.019
and gave the office the cash that is practical wisdom.

00:08:10.019 --> 00:08:15.699
Now if we go back to Luke chapter 16, let's look at verse 10.

00:08:15.699 --> 00:08:20.860
Here it's interesting that the principle of the person faithful in what is least will

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:27.980
be faithful in much was given in the context of our use of material riches.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.259
So we cannot take this responsibility lightly.

00:08:31.259 --> 00:08:33.860
Notice what it says in verse 11.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:39.340
It says, therefore, if you have not proved yourselves faithful in connection with the unrighteous

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:45.720
riches, who will entrust you with what is true?

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:53.240
Yes, the way we use our monetary riches or goods will affect the extent to which the

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:59.440
things that are true such as kingdom interest are entrusted to us.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:06.360
Therefore, let's remember the key point of Jesus illustration of the unrighteous steward.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:12.960
No matter how much or how little of this world's goods we have under our control, we want

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:20.000
to use them to strengthen our relationship with our best friends, Jehovah and Jesus.
