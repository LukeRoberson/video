00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:08.589
Change. It happens all the time in life.

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:12.589
How we adapt to change isn't always easy.

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:17.589
As a family, we've always tried to put Jehovah in his will first.

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:21.589
And now it's time for change again.

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:29.940
Let me explain. Family worship has always been an important part of our spiritual routine.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.939
Studying with our children came naturally.

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:35.939
It just flowed and we enjoyed it.

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:51.109
But when the last of our children moved out, we just hit a wall.

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:56.460
I was finding it awkward to study with my wife alone.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:17.879
Our family worshipers becoming nothing more than a stale question and answer session.

00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:30.719
And gradually, it got worse.

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:36.060
Until finally, we stocked all together.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:51.459
Sometimes with change, we just need a wake-up call.

00:01:51.459 --> 00:02:03.650
I had almost forgotten how deep a student of the Bible she is.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:20.889
How could I make our family worship more enjoyable for her, for myself, for both of us?

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:22.889
I had to do something.

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:33.740
The faithful slave has always encouraged husbands to study with their wives.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:42.389
I meditated on 1 Peter the 3rd chapter, verse 7, where it says,

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:46.389
You husbands continue dwelling with them according to knowledge.

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:52.180
Assign them honor.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.180
I reflected on the example of Abraham and Sarah.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.180
At one point, Abraham had to adjust and pay attention to his wife's feelings.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.180
In fact, Jehovah said, listen to her.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:34.289
Was I listening?

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:39.289
Like Abraham and Sarah, it was time for us to have a heart to heart.

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:56.659
I let her know that her feelings really mattered to me and that with a little creativity

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:59.659
and finding material that would interest both of us.

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:16.379
Our studies could be more enjoyable.

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:39.579
We decided to make a new start.

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:44.579
Family worship is taken on a fresh and exciting new role in our marriage.

00:04:44.579 --> 00:05:14.620
In fact, it is the highlight of our week by adding variety to our studies.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.620
They are now more rich, meaningful and engaging.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:33.420
Yes, change can bring about new challenges, but it also creates new opportunities.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:42.399
Together, we are drawing closer to each other and to Jehovah.
