Thank you so much for your visit see you later sister Elsa is

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.140
Also gonna die oh

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
We don't know yet

00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:30.460
Can't you hope it just fix her? Oh

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.859
Honey

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:40.289
He's already done something to help her. Do you remember who he sent?

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.969
Jesus

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:46.049
But how does that help her now?

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:50.299
Hmm

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:54.700
Do you remember how long Adam was supposed to live forever?

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.899
But then he didn't listen to Jehovah and ruined everything

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.980
Since we are all Adam's children that means we also get sick old and eventually died

00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:11.099
But what hope did Jehovah give us?

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.299
He sent Jesus to give his life in place of the one that Adam lost

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.420
How could he do that?

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.180
Because he was perfect like Adam, but he obeyed Jehovah

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:25.659
Yes

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:32.299
Thanks to Jehovah for giving us Jesus as the ransom now. We all have the hope of living forever in paradise

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.620
And when we are going through tough times like right now

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.659
That hope can get us through
