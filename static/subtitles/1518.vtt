00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:07.070
This video follows a path approaching Jerusalem from the east.

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:13.310
It shows the village of modern-day Et Tours, thought to correspond to the Biblical Bethphagy,

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.670
and continues on to one of the higher points on the Mount of Olives.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.390
Seen here are one, the road from Bethany to Bethphagy,

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.629
two, the location of Bethphagy,

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:36.140
three, the Mount of Olives, four, the Kidron Valley beyond the Mount of Olives,

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:48.179
and five, the Temple Mount.

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:52.420
When traveling from Lazarus home in Bethany to Jerusalem,

00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:15.359
Jesus may have followed a route similar to the one shown here.

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:19.040
Identified again is three, the Mount of Olives,

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.799
which descends into four, the Kidron Valley.

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.480
On the far side is five, the Temple Mount.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.280
On Nysen 933 CE, Jesus rode the Cult of Adonki

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.079
over the Mount of Olives to Jerusalem.

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.560
He may have started from Bethphagy and followed the road to Jerusalem.
