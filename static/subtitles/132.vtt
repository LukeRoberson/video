00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:07.940
My comments to you today are based on 2nd Peter chapter 1 verse 19.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.939
There it states, we have the prophetic word made more sure.

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:17.940
Yes, we are fortified by the prophetic word.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.940
Actually, there is no one on earth today that is not affected by prophecy,

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.940
even if he is not aware of it.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.940
What is a prophecy?

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:34.939
The Hebrew term for prophecy is not limited to predicting or foretelling something in the future.

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:39.939
It also includes divine commands or inspired instruction.

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:47.939
The Samaritan woman at the well recognized Jesus as a prophet because he revealed not future things,

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:53.939
but things about her past that he could not have known except by divine power.

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:58.939
The source of all true prophecy is Jehovah God.

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:09.939
At 2nd Peter chapter 1 verse 21, it is said of prophecy that men spoke from God as they were moved by Holy Spirit.

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:20.939
In addition to transmitting prophecy by Holy Spirit, Jehovah occasionally communicated such messages by means of angels.

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.939
One outstanding prophet was Daniel.

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:35.939
In about 536 before our common era, Daniel recorded a vision involving world powers having interaction with God's servants.

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.939
Turned with me to Daniel chapter 8 verses 21 and 22.

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.939
Daniel's vision was of animals representing governments.

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.939
Note this remarkable prophecy at Daniel chapter 8 verses 21 and 22.

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:05.180
The hairy male goat stands for the king of Greece, and the great horn that was between its eyes stands for the first king.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:18.740
As for the horn that was broken, so that force stood up instead of it, there are four kingdoms from his nation that will stand up, but not with his power.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:33.740
Interestingly, the Bible specifically named Greece, the ruler under which Greece became a world power in relation to God's people like a great horn was the Macedonian Alexander the Great.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:46.740
Alexander's rulership was short-lived. He died young in the year 323 before our common era, 213 years after Daniel wrote his book.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:56.740
Jehovah's angel had told Daniel that there would be four kingdoms from his nation that will stand up in place of the Greece Empire.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:04.740
And chapter 11 verse 4 specifically states that the four regions would not go to his descendants.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.740
Do the historical facts support these prophecies?

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:19.740
Yes, Alexander's two sons from different women, Heracles and Alexander the Fourth both were killed before they reached adulthood.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:29.740
Isn't it astounding how precisely the prophecy came true that the rulership would not be passed on to Alexander's posterity?

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:37.740
But the prophecy also foretold that Alexander's empire would be divided up into four kingdoms.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:52.740
Did that happen? Yes, one source listed 72 different military leaders under Alexander the Great, but the prophecy said only four would eventually rule in his place.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:04:05.740
After Alexander's death there were constant fierce battles between these military leaders, but finally just four dynasties resulted, just as the Bible prophesied.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:13.740
One was that of General Cassander, son of Antipater, in Macedonia and Greece.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:20.740
The second was that of General LeSymechus in Asia Minor and European Thrace.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:35.740
Third was the one of General Celucus, Nikitor, the Conqueror, who secured Babylon, media, Syria, Persia and the provinces eastward to the Indus River.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:47.740
And finally the fourth was that of General Tholomy Sotr, son of Legus, who secured Egypt, Libya, Arabia, Palestine and Silas Syria.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:56.740
These four proclaimed themselves King around 305 before our common era, 18 years after the death of Alexander.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:05.740
The prophecy was so detailed, its fulfillment is fascinating proof of divine inspiration.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:17.540
Does this not strengthen your faith and trust in the Bible? Here's another point. What is the first prophecy in the Bible?

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:25.540
The first prophecy ever was the one uttered by Jehovah at Genesis chapter 3 verse 15.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:37.540
It foretold that the offspring of his figurative wife, the heavenly part of his organization, would crush Satan and his offspring, bringing liberation to mankind.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:47.540
To identify this offspring, primarily Christ Jesus, Jehovah arranged for many prophecies pointing to him.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:06:00.540
Revelation chapter 19 verse 10 says, the witness concerning Jesus is what inspires prophecy, or literally is the spirit of prophecy.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:10.540
What does that mean? That all inspired Messianic messages from God proclaimed by his servants pointed to his son.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:21.540
At Luke chapter 24 verse 44, Jesus himself said that all the prophecies concerning the Messiah must be fulfilled.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.540
Let's consider some outstanding prophecies about Jesus and their fulfillment.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:36.100
One was that he would be born of the tribe of Judah from the family of David, the son of Jesse.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:45.100
More than 700 years before Jesus was born, Micah foretold in chapter 5 that he would be born in Bethlehem.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.100
The prophecy speaks of Bethlehem Ephrathah.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:59.100
Why is the designation Ephrathah important? Because there existed another Bethlehem in the territory of Zebulun.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:08.100
It has been identified with Bidlam about seven miles or 11 kilometers west northwest of Nazareth.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:18.100
Again, the prophecy was extremely specific, and amazingly I say a prophesied he would be born of a virgin.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.100
What human would ever think of such a thing?

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:31.100
Daniel chapter 9 foretold that the Messiah would arrive 483 years after the command to rebuild Jerusalem.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:38.100
This proved to be true in the year 29 of Archermen era, when Jesus was baptized.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:45.100
Zachariah chapter 11 foretold that the Messiah would be betrayed for 30 pieces of silver.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:50.100
Chapter 12 says that his body would be pierced.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:58.100
It was foretold that the Messiah would die a sacrificial death for our sins and be buried in the tomb of a rich man.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:06.100
Furthermore, prophecy proclaimed that he would be in the grave for parts of three days and then be resurrected.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:17.420
What about the argument that Jesus deliberately arranged matters so that the events in his life would fit all these prophecies?

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:26.420
What do you think? Could Jesus have arranged to be born of the tribe of Judah in the town of David's birth, Bethlehem?

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:35.419
His mother Mary lived in Nazareth. Could he tell her while in the womb, please take me to Bethlehem because the Scripture say,

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:44.419
I must be born there. Obviously, the very start of his life on earth was beyond his control.

00:08:44.419 --> 00:08:52.419
Furthermore, could Jesus have arranged for the priests to pay Judas the 30 pieces of silver to betray him?

00:08:52.419 --> 00:09:01.419
Could he have arranged that his enemies bid in his face, that the Roman authorities sentenced him to be nailed to a stake?

00:09:01.419 --> 00:09:12.419
Could the soldiers cast lots for his garments? Or that while piercing his sight with the spear, they not follow the custom of breaking any of his bones?

00:09:12.419 --> 00:09:18.419
Could the prophecies just mention have been fulfilled by mere chance?

00:09:18.419 --> 00:09:27.419
One Bible scholar likened this process to the assembling of a statue made of individual pieces of marble.

00:09:27.419 --> 00:09:34.419
Imagine that many men who had never communicated with one another each brought a piece of marble into a room.

00:09:34.419 --> 00:09:49.419
If those pieces fit together to form a perfect statue, you would logically conclude that there must have been someone behind the scenes who had drawn the specifications and sent an assignment to each man.

00:09:50.419 --> 00:10:01.919
Fitting together like the pieces of the statue, every messianic prophecy would provide a vital piece of information about the Messiah.

00:10:01.919 --> 00:10:12.200
What then would be the likelihood of all the prophecies about the Messiah being fulfilled by coincidence in one person?

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:16.200
In an interview, researcher Louis Lapides said,

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:30.200
someone did the math and figured out that the probability of just eight prophecies being fulfilled by Jesus is one chance in 100 million billion.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:44.200
To arrive at the figure mentioned by this scholar by addition rather than by multiplication, you would have to write down one million and then copy that figure a billion times.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:11:02.200
Putting those odds in perspective, the scholars stated, if you took 100 million billion silver dollars, they would cover the state of Texas in the United States to a depth of two feet or 0.6 meters.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:12.200
Texas has a land area of 266,807 square miles or 690,000 square kilometers.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:19.200
Imagine that huge area covered in silver dollars up to a depth of two feet.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:33.200
Now, what if you put a mark on just one of those silver dollars and then had a blindfolded person wander the whole state and bend down to pick up just one coin?

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:39.200
What would be the chance that he choose the only coin that had been marked?

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:50.200
The scholar then stated that those are the same odds that anybody in history could have fulfilled just eight of the Messianic prophecies.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:12:01.200
Yet Jesus fulfilled not just eight but many more Bible prophecies. This is overwhelming proof of divine inspiration.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:12.200
Second Corinthians chapter 1 verse 20 says, no matter how many the promises of God are they have become yes by means of Jesus.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:20.200
What does this mean for us? It means that Jesus was actually the promised Messiah who was sent by God.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:29.200
As such, he taught the truth. If we believe him and follow him, then we too have the truth.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:34.200
There's no doubt about the divine origin of Bible prophecies.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:45.200
But Bible prophecies deal not only with past events, some prophecies are having remarkable fulfillment right now before our eyes.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:13:01.200
This gives us strong assurance that the few outstanding prophecies about the end of this wicked system of things and the paradise on earth to come will also be fulfilled in the near future without any possibility of failure.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:10.200
As true Christians, we are engaged in a prophetic work. This is not in the sense that we initiate new prophecies,

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:16.200
but in the sense that we proclaim prophecies already written down in the Bible.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:25.200
At Pentecost 33 of our common era, when Holy Spirit was poured out on 120 disciples, with men and women,

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:31.200
Peter quoted the prophet Joel saying, in the last days, God says,

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:39.200
I will pour out some of my spirit on every sort of flesh and your sons and your daughters will prophesy.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:50.200
What did the 120 disciples do at Pentecost? There's no indication that they foretold new events, but Acts chapter 2 verse 11 says,

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:57.200
we hear them speaking about the magnificent things of God. This was called prophesying.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:07.200
Today too, whether brothers or sisters or children, we share in a prophetic work, speaking about the magnificent things of God.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:13.200
We speak about what he has done, what he is doing now, and what he will do in the near future.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:22.200
What a privilege. Having seen many prophecies fulfilled, we have the prophetic work made more sure.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:29.200
And we are telling people about the prophetic work in order to fortify their faith too.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:39.200
Yes, we do it to help them get to the road to everlasting life and to develop an intimate relationship with our great God, Jehovah.
