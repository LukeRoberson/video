00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.339
I want you to stop braiding so I could go outside.

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:20.179
Aww.

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:22.420
I wish you could go outside too.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.179
But we need the rain, so plants can grow,

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:28.019
and we can have things to eat.

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.420
It's a good thing.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.219
Even Jehovah waits for things, so he knows how we feel.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.219
There have been lots of things wrong with the world

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:41.060
for thousands of years.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.340
Jehovah wants to fix them all.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.179
But he's waiting for just the right time to do it.

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:50.939
Jehovah must be so bored.

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:52.740
Not even a little bit,

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.539
because he stays busy doing good things,

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:58.740
like teaching us and taking care of the preaching work.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.219
You can stay busy doing good things, too.

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.019
Perhaps you can ask Jehovah to help you be patient.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:12.489
Now, instead of just sitting there being bored,

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:16.489
you can help me do all these dishes.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:28.189
You are fast.

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:29.510
Thank you, Caleb.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.750
Look, it stopped raining.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.150
The rain always stops eventually.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.390
You just have to be patient.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.549
And since you helped me with the dishes,

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.189
so nice of you,

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:41.950
now I can take you to the park.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.390
Yes.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.349
I'm a frog.

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:46.510
Ribbit frogs over the mud.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.349
Get it, frog!

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:48.590
No, no, no, wait!
