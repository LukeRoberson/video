00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.179
Jesus was a perfect man, just as Adam had been.

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:13.179
However, unlike Adam, Jesus remained obedient.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:19.179
This allowed him to give his life as a ransom in exchange for many.

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:25.179
But how could the death of one man benefit all of mankind?

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:31.179
Well, imagine that the manager of a large factory steals money from the company.

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:48.250
Disactions lunge the company into debt, forcing it to shut down.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.250
The workers lose their jobs and cannot pay their bills.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:00.219
Many suffer because of that one man's corruption.

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:07.750
Now suppose a kind and generous man feels sorry for all those who are suffering.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.750
He has moved to pay off the debt and reopen the company.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:22.299
By canceling that one debt, he brings relief to all the employees and their families.

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:31.230
Adam is like that corrupt manager.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:37.230
When he rebelled, he incurred a large debt of sin and passed it on to his children.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.230
Jesus is like the generous man.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.230
When he gave up his perfect human life, he paid off the debt of sin

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.230
and reopened the prospect of living forever for each of us.
