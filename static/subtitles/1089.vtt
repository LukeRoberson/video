WEBVTT

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:04.809
Good day, brothers and sisters.

00:00:04.809 --> 00:00:08.849
Our next session will begin with a music video presentation.

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.050
This afternoon's music video presentation

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.410
shows the joy of our brothers around the earth

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.250
as they share in giving a witness.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.289
It also reminds us that we can always rely on Jehovah

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.730
for support.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:37.060
Let's watch and listen.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.060
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.060
He has taught you the Holy Spirit of God,

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.340
and He has told us not to let it go.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.340
Let's watch and listen.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.340
Let's watch and listen.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.340
Let's watch and listen.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.159
Let's watch and listen.

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:04.159
Let's watch and listen.

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.159
Let's watch and listen.

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.159
Let's watch and listen.

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.159
Let's watch and listen.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:10:35.850
The opening song for this session highlights the importance of including Jehovah in one's marriage.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.850
We invite you to stand and sing song number 131 entitled,

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:41.850
What God has Yoke Together.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:12:27.779
Please be seated.

00:12:27.779 --> 00:12:32.029
Marriage and family life are not always easy.

00:12:32.029 --> 00:12:37.029
The amount of joy you find in your family depends in part on you.

00:12:37.029 --> 00:12:42.029
The following four parts symposium will help husbands, wives, parents, and children

00:12:42.029 --> 00:12:46.029
to find joy together despite imperfections.

00:12:46.029 --> 00:12:49.029
Each speaker will introduce the next.

00:12:49.029 --> 00:12:55.029
Brother Seth Hyatt, a helper to the service committee, will present the first talk entitled,

00:12:55.029 --> 00:12:57.029
Cultivate joy in your family.

00:12:57.029 --> 00:13:00.029
Husbands, rejoice in your wife.

00:13:00.029 --> 00:13:14.259
Can you imagine how Adam must have felt when he was introduced to Eve?

00:13:14.259 --> 00:13:18.259
Actually, we don't have to imagine how he felt.

00:13:18.259 --> 00:13:23.259
We know that he was overwhelmed with appreciation.

00:13:24.259 --> 00:13:30.259
And he expressed his appreciation in poetic terms that are recorded in the Bible.

00:13:30.259 --> 00:13:32.259
You remember the words,

00:13:32.259 --> 00:13:40.259
This is at last, bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.

00:13:40.259 --> 00:13:42.259
Think about it.

00:13:42.259 --> 00:13:46.259
Adam and Eve had a perfect marriage.

00:13:46.259 --> 00:13:52.799
And together, they formed a perfect family.

00:13:52.799 --> 00:13:56.799
Of course, with their disobedience, all of that changed.

00:13:56.799 --> 00:14:02.799
Instead of perfection, they were confronted with one another's imperfections.

00:14:02.799 --> 00:14:07.799
And in the instant that they separated themselves from Jehovah,

00:14:07.799 --> 00:14:16.799
they began to experience stress and anxiety that affected their relationship.

00:14:16.799 --> 00:14:21.799
It is a testimony to Jehovah's love and wisdom

00:14:21.799 --> 00:14:31.799
despite imperfections and despite the stress and anxiety that have only intensified in these last days.

00:14:31.799 --> 00:14:40.799
The family can still be a source of joy, a place of security and stability.

00:14:40.799 --> 00:14:50.799
But for that to happen, each member of the family must shoulder his load of scriptural responsibility.

00:14:50.799 --> 00:15:00.799
This symposium, we're going to consider husbands, wives, parents and children

00:15:00.799 --> 00:15:06.799
and how each of us can contribute to the joy of the family.

00:15:06.799 --> 00:15:12.799
To start, let's address husbands.

00:15:12.799 --> 00:15:19.799
If you are a husband, how do you view your wife?

00:15:19.799 --> 00:15:23.799
Do you view her as Jehovah does?

00:15:23.799 --> 00:15:33.799
Do you view her and feel about her as Adam felt about Eve when he first met her?

00:15:33.799 --> 00:15:42.799
In fact, the Bible helps us husbands appreciate that our wives are a gift from Jehovah.

00:15:42.799 --> 00:15:46.799
Do you appreciate the gift?

00:15:46.799 --> 00:15:51.799
And are you demonstrating your appreciation?

00:15:51.799 --> 00:16:02.799
For a few minutes this morning, we're going to consider four ways that we husbands can demonstrate appreciation for the gift Jehovah has given us.

00:16:02.799 --> 00:16:06.799
If you're taking notes, here they are.

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:13.799
Number one, it's important that we assign our wives on her.

00:16:13.799 --> 00:16:20.799
Number two, we must invest time in our relationship.

00:16:20.799 --> 00:16:28.799
Number three, it's important that we confine our romantic interests to our wife.

00:16:28.799 --> 00:16:36.799
And number four, we have to be realistic in our expectations.

00:16:36.799 --> 00:16:40.799
Let's consider these points one at a time.

00:16:40.799 --> 00:16:47.580
Turn please in your Bible to first Peter, chapter three.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:53.179
And we're going to read verse seven.

00:16:53.179 --> 00:17:00.179
You husbands, in the same way continued dwelling with them according to knowledge.

00:17:00.179 --> 00:17:06.180
Assign them on her as to a weaker vessel, the feminine one,

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:12.180
since they are also errors with you of the undeserved favor of life.

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:18.180
In order for your prayers not to be hindered.

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:24.180
Well, Peter leaves us in no doubt as to who are being addressed.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:30.180
You husbands, that's you and me.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:37.180
He tells us that we must continue dwelling with our wives according to knowledge.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:45.180
The footnote in our Bible says showing them consideration or understanding them.

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:48.180
How well do you know your wife?

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:53.180
What do you know about her background, her upbringing?

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:56.180
You know what makes her happy?

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:58.180
Do you know why?

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:01.180
You know what's upsetting to her?

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:04.180
What causes anxiety?

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:07.180
Do you understand why?

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:13.180
See, it's important that we take the time to get to know our wives.

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:22.180
Because only then can we care for their physical, emotional, and spiritual needs.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:27.180
And only then can we do what Peter next says in the verse.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:30.180
And here's our main point.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:33.180
Assign them on her.

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:36.180
Assign your wife on her.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:41.180
And then Peter says as to a weaker vessel.

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:48.180
Now, what does Peter mean when he refers to the wife as a weaker vessel?

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:53.180
Do you think he's betraying some chauvinistic leaning?

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:59.180
No, because he's already said, assign her on her.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:02.180
We could illustrate it this way.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:12.180
Imagine that you have two bowls, exactly the same sawas, exactly the same capacity.

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:21.180
But one is made of wood, and the other is made of very fine, very expensive porcelain.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:27.180
Both bowls, both with the same capacity.

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:31.180
But would you handle both in the same way?

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.180
No.

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:39.180
See, you recognize that the porcelain is more valuable and more fragile.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:44.180
So you handle it in a different way.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:47.180
And that's what Peter is telling us about our wives.

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:52.180
She is the weaker vessel, the feminine one.

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:55.180
In what way is she weaker?

00:19:55.180 --> 00:20:00.180
Certainly not intellectually, and certainly not spiritually.

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:06.180
Primarily, in a physical sense, we husbands have an advantage.

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:11.809
So we accord our wife on her.

00:20:11.809 --> 00:20:15.809
That means we would never get physical with her.

00:20:15.809 --> 00:20:24.809
And certainly we would never, on a pretext, pretend to honor her in public

00:20:24.809 --> 00:20:29.809
and then abuse her in some way in private.

00:20:29.809 --> 00:20:32.809
See, that would never work, would it?

00:20:32.809 --> 00:20:38.809
No, we assign her honor at all times.

00:20:38.809 --> 00:20:41.809
And here's why.

00:20:41.809 --> 00:20:47.809
Peter says they are also heirs with you of the undeserved favor of life.

00:20:47.809 --> 00:20:54.809
Husbands and wives are on equal footing before Jehovah in a spiritual sense.

00:20:54.809 --> 00:21:00.809
Both husbands and wives must wash their robes and make them white in the blood of the lamb.

00:21:00.809 --> 00:21:07.809
Jesus did not die more for husbands than he did for wives.

00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:13.809
And both husbands and wives have the hope of everlasting life.

00:21:13.809 --> 00:21:21.809
So we remember that if we don't, how does Peter conclude?

00:21:21.809 --> 00:21:25.809
In order for your prayers not to be hindered.

00:21:25.809 --> 00:21:38.279
The point, our dealings with our wife will have a direct impact on our personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:21:38.279 --> 00:21:49.279
So assign her honor, value what she does for you and for your family and demonstrate your appreciation.

00:21:49.279 --> 00:21:54.279
Our second point, invest time in your relationship.

00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:58.559
It's so easy, isn't it?

00:21:58.559 --> 00:22:11.769
For secular work, theocratic assignments and association with others to rob us a valuable time that should be spent with our wives.

00:22:11.769 --> 00:22:20.769
Interestingly, when we were getting to know one another, courting, we were anxious for one-on-one time.

00:22:20.769 --> 00:22:23.769
That shouldn't change when we got married.

00:22:23.769 --> 00:22:31.769
So buy out the time, set it aside and stick to it.

00:22:31.769 --> 00:22:38.769
In that way, you demonstrate your appreciation for the gift Jehovah has given you.

00:22:38.769 --> 00:22:42.769
Our third point is highlighted in Proverbs chapter 5.

00:22:42.769 --> 00:22:44.769
So turn there with me, please.

00:22:44.769 --> 00:22:52.140
Proverbs chapter 5 and we'll begin reading in verse 18.

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:55.140
May your own fountain be blessed.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.140
And here's the point.

00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:03.140
And may you rejoice with the wife of your youth.

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:07.140
A loving doe, a graceful mountain goat.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:12.140
Let her breasts satisfy you at all times.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.140
And then here again is the point.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:19.140
May you be captivated by her love constantly.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:22.799
What is the point?

00:23:22.799 --> 00:23:28.799
We must confine our romantic interests to our wife.

00:23:28.799 --> 00:23:31.799
There's no other option.

00:23:31.799 --> 00:23:36.799
We want to rejoice with the wife of our youth.

00:23:36.799 --> 00:23:39.799
We want to be captivated by her love.

00:23:39.799 --> 00:23:44.799
That means avoiding overly close relationships with other women.

00:23:44.799 --> 00:23:51.799
And not just physical relationships, texting, video conferencing,

00:23:51.799 --> 00:23:56.799
telephone calls, all constitute a relationship.

00:23:56.799 --> 00:24:02.799
So we're very careful we set limits and we don't go beyond them.

00:24:02.799 --> 00:24:12.799
And confining our romantic interests to our wife includes rejecting sexual fantasies involving others.

00:24:12.799 --> 00:24:17.799
The world makes light of such fantasizing.

00:24:17.799 --> 00:24:22.799
But Jesus helped us to appreciate it's a very serious matter.

00:24:22.799 --> 00:24:26.799
Do you recall his words in the sermon on the mount?

00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:37.799
Anyone who keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery in his heart.

00:24:37.799 --> 00:24:43.799
The point fantasizing is little more than rehearsing.

00:24:44.799 --> 00:24:53.799
So we reject such fantasies knowing that they violate Bible counsel including Jesus' very pointed advice.

00:24:53.799 --> 00:25:00.240
And they can prevent us from rejoicing in our wife.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.240
Finally, number four.

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:07.240
Be realistic in your expectations.

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:11.240
We husbands are not perfect. We know that.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:14.240
Our wives are not perfect.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:22.240
Don't you appreciate it when your wife smooths over your imperfection and makes you look good?

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:27.240
Well, our wives appreciate it when we do that for them.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:31.240
So be alert for opportunities to do that.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:41.519
In the following dramatization, notice how the husband rejoices in his wife.

00:25:41.519 --> 00:25:45.519
I was trying to get caught up on paperwork for the circuit overseas visit.

00:25:45.519 --> 00:25:53.339
There was so much to do.

00:25:53.339 --> 00:26:00.049
You gotta be kidding me.

00:26:00.049 --> 00:26:06.509
Well, you're home early, honey. I said something was wrong.

00:26:06.509 --> 00:26:12.529
The kids had left a few things out and I was a bit preoccupied.

00:26:12.529 --> 00:26:14.529
The tough day?

00:26:14.529 --> 00:26:28.839
You were supposed to talk to the girls about this. They're making it a habit.

00:26:28.839 --> 00:26:36.049
The more I thought about it though, I realized it wasn't just a kitchen.

00:26:36.049 --> 00:26:39.049
I guess I was part of the problem.

00:26:39.049 --> 00:26:45.420
Or maybe the problem was me.

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:48.420
You see, my wife is an amazing woman.

00:26:48.420 --> 00:27:09.619
I'm so loving. It would be an understatement to call her industrious.

00:27:09.619 --> 00:27:18.059
And then there's her infectious joy.

00:27:18.059 --> 00:27:27.460
I mean, how could I not love her?

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:31.460
But sometimes it takes more than saying I love you.

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:35.809
You know, honey, you're right.

00:27:35.809 --> 00:27:38.809
This is completely unacceptable.

00:27:38.809 --> 00:27:41.809
I'll talk to the girls as soon as they come through that door.

00:27:41.809 --> 00:27:44.809
Thank you. I love you.

00:27:44.809 --> 00:27:49.720
I love you too.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:54.720
Did you notice how the husband in the video rejoiced in his wife?

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:59.720
He reflected on her many good works.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.720
Her devotion to Jehovah.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.720
The good act that she performed for others.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:08.720
Her fine work in behalf of her family.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:13.720
Her spontaneous joy that made her even more beautiful to him.

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:19.720
And as he reflected on all of those fine things, what happened?

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:23.720
His appreciation for his gift, deepened.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:28.720
And he was motivated to do something about it.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:31.720
That's a beautiful example for us.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:37.720
So, rejoice in your wife by assigning her honor,

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.720
by investing time in your relationship,

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:44.720
by confining your romantic interests to your wife,

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:48.720
and by being realistic in your expectations.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:55.720
If you do, your marriage and your family will continue to be a source of joy,

00:28:55.720 --> 00:29:01.720
a place of stability, and a place of security.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:06.720
Brother Patrick LaFranca, a helper to the personnel committee of the governing body,

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:10.720
will now present the next talk of the symposium.

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.720
Cultivate joy in your family.

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:16.720
Wives rejoice in your husband.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:27.470
Christian Wives, are you happy?

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:29.470
Do you love being a wife?

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:32.470
Well, probably right now you're looking at your husband and saying,

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:35.470
of course, that's good.

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:40.470
But could you add even more joy to your marriage?

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:46.470
You may be thinking, yes, if only my husband would,

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:48.470
and you finish the sentence.

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:53.470
I think most husbands would admit we have some room for improvement,

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:55.470
but this talk is for you.

00:29:55.470 --> 00:30:00.470
What can you do as a wife to add joy to your marriage?

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:06.470
Well, one of the first things is to think about your God assigned role.

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:13.470
Open please to Genesis chapter 2 and verse 18.

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:22.470
Now here, Jehovah is going to explain why he was making a wife for Adam.

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:28.470
Then Jehovah God said, it is not good for the man to continue to be alone.

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:35.470
I am going to make a helper for him as a compliment of him.

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:44.470
So Eve was going to be a helper as a compliment of Adam.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:46.470
What is a compliment?

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:52.470
Well, we feel sure that you sisters know a lot about complementary colors.

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:56.470
When you go to pick out an outfit with accessories,

00:30:56.470 --> 00:31:01.470
you pick those with colors that blend well together,

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:07.470
that are harmonious combination, or when you're making a meal.

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:12.470
You know there are certain foods that go well with other foods,

00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:15.470
or compliment other foods.

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:21.470
Like a Korean sister making kimchi probably will make rice,

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:26.470
or pasta with cheese, bacon and eggs, bread and butter.

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:31.470
There are so many combinations that compliment one another.

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:34.470
So when Jehovah God created Eve,

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:41.470
he built into her feminine qualities that he knew would really work well

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:45.470
with Adam's masculine qualities.

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:54.470
So Adam and Eve had a prospect of being a perfectly matched couple.

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:56.470
They could work well together.

00:31:56.470 --> 00:32:03.470
Eve could be fully happy in working with her husband and caring for that garden,

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:06.470
a beautiful home God-gatherer.

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:11.470
But of course, we know that didn't happen because of sin.

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:13.470
Along with sin came stress.

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:16.470
And here we are, descendants of Adam and Eve.

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:20.470
That's what we've got to, sin and stress.

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:23.470
But Jehovah helps us, doesn't he?

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:28.470
And he gives us principles that can help us make a happy marriage.

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:32.470
Please open to Ecclesiastes.

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:36.470
Now Ecclesiastes chapter four, verse nine and ten,

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:40.470
describe what a partnership should be like.

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:44.470
So wives, do you think of yourself as your husband's partner?

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:48.470
Well, let's read verse nine.

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:53.470
Two are better than one because they have a good reward for their hard work.

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:56.470
So your husband has made a decision.

00:32:56.470 --> 00:33:01.470
And maybe you think, hmm, I don't know if that's the best decision.

00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:04.470
But you're his partner.

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:08.470
So how will you help him?

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:10.470
Well, you're going to support that decision.

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:12.470
You're going to try to make it work.

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:15.470
And what will be your reward?

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:20.470
Well, first of all, you're going to accomplish so much more working together

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:23.470
than you could individually.

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:27.470
But more than that, you're going to strengthen your friendship,

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:31.470
your partnership with your husband.

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:35.470
Now, verse ten, it adds, for if one of them falls,

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:38.470
the other can help his partner up.

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:43.470
But what will happen to the one who falls with no one to help him up?

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:46.470
You may be thinking, well, my husband's a strong man.

00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:48.470
And probably so.

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:54.470
But inside, he may be struggling with serious insecurities.

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:57.470
At times, he may feel like a failure.

00:33:57.470 --> 00:34:03.470
Maybe he's lost his job and feels like he's not a good provider.

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:05.470
You're his partner.

00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:08.469
What are you going to do to lift him up?

00:34:08.469 --> 00:34:15.469
Probably you're going to share with him some tactful words of comfort and encouragement.

00:34:15.469 --> 00:34:18.469
That'll be a happy place.

00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:25.469
The book of Proverbs contains a much wisdom and some of it is directed to wives.

00:34:25.469 --> 00:34:29.469
For example, Proverbs fourteen one.

00:34:29.469 --> 00:34:33.469
The truly wise woman builds up her house,

00:34:33.469 --> 00:34:38.469
but the foolish one tears it down with her own hands.

00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:45.469
So if you are wise, you will build up or increase respect for your husband

00:34:45.469 --> 00:34:48.469
on the part of your children and of others.

00:34:48.469 --> 00:34:53.780
You don't want to be foolish by speaking negatively,

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:57.780
talking about your husband's deficiencies or failures.

00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:05.780
Nor would you want to undermine his own confidence by nagging or arguing with him.

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:09.780
You can do so much to contribute to a happy house.

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:12.780
For example, at mealtimes,

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:19.780
sharing in the conversation, adding perhaps a spiritual gem you found in your Bible reading

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:22.780
or a nice experience or even a humorous story,

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:26.780
something that will lift the spirits of the whole family.

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:36.059
Now, we want to go to Proverbs chapter 31 and probably right away you recognize

00:35:36.059 --> 00:35:42.059
this is the chapter that describes a capable wife.

00:35:42.059 --> 00:35:45.059
And I think all of you wives want to be that.

00:35:45.059 --> 00:35:48.059
You want to be that Proverbs 31 wife.

00:35:48.059 --> 00:35:53.059
When you read those verses, you realize this woman is very busy.

00:35:53.059 --> 00:35:56.059
She's out there buying household supplies,

00:35:56.059 --> 00:36:00.059
caring for the health and the welfare of her family,

00:36:00.059 --> 00:36:05.059
helping others in need, spending money wisely,

00:36:05.059 --> 00:36:10.059
diligently caring for all the duties of a wife, mother, friend and neighbor.

00:36:10.059 --> 00:36:15.059
We think many of you wives are doing all of those things.

00:36:15.059 --> 00:36:22.059
And you do it day in and day out and you don't complain and you're happy.

00:36:22.059 --> 00:36:25.059
Happy because you're giving.

00:36:25.059 --> 00:36:29.059
And then you're even happier when this happens.

00:36:29.059 --> 00:36:36.059
In verse 28, her children rise up and declare her happy.

00:36:36.059 --> 00:36:40.059
Her husband rises up and praises her.

00:36:40.059 --> 00:36:42.059
So they do appreciate what you do.

00:36:42.059 --> 00:36:47.059
Sometimes they may not express it, but they do appreciate it.

00:36:47.059 --> 00:36:50.059
There is another element to a very happy marriage.

00:36:50.059 --> 00:36:54.059
And that's expressed in verse 11.

00:36:54.059 --> 00:37:00.059
Her husband trusts her from his heart and he lacks nothing of value.

00:37:00.059 --> 00:37:06.409
Trust is so important in a marriage.

00:37:06.409 --> 00:37:12.409
A wife must trust her husband and a husband must trust his wife.

00:37:12.409 --> 00:37:14.409
You're going to have conversations.

00:37:14.409 --> 00:37:18.409
You're going to express your innermost feelings and thoughts.

00:37:18.409 --> 00:37:23.409
You must not have fear that they're going to be that's going to be shared with others.

00:37:23.409 --> 00:37:28.409
Or you'll be belittled in some way.

00:37:28.409 --> 00:37:33.409
Now that's trust, a very important aspect of marriage.

00:37:33.409 --> 00:37:39.409
So you wise, build up your friendship, your confidence with your husband.

00:37:39.409 --> 00:37:48.409
Now, verse 12, it adds, she rewards him with good, not bad, all the days of her life.

00:37:48.409 --> 00:37:56.409
So wives, reward your husband with good, support him in what he has to do.

00:37:56.409 --> 00:37:59.409
And we know that he will love you all the more.

00:37:59.409 --> 00:38:01.409
It says all the days of your life.

00:38:01.409 --> 00:38:05.409
So all the days of your life build up that friendship with your husband.

00:38:05.409 --> 00:38:09.409
Whether he is a believer or not.

00:38:09.409 --> 00:38:16.409
And we have to say in behalf of the thousands of hardworking elders and ministerial servants,

00:38:16.409 --> 00:38:24.409
without your faithful support, it would be much more challenging to care for our responsibilities.

00:38:24.409 --> 00:38:30.409
So thank you very much, dear wives, for what you're doing.

00:38:30.409 --> 00:38:35.409
Now, sometimes you feel obliged to speak your mind.

00:38:35.409 --> 00:38:39.409
And in a trusting relationship, that's expected.

00:38:39.409 --> 00:38:42.409
But how will you speak your mind?

00:38:42.409 --> 00:38:47.409
Notice verse 26, she opens her mouth and wisdom.

00:38:47.409 --> 00:38:51.409
The law of kindness is on her tongue.

00:38:51.409 --> 00:38:59.409
So yes, you have something worthwhile to say, but how you say it is very, very important.

00:38:59.409 --> 00:39:03.409
Will the law of kindness govern your tongue?

00:39:03.409 --> 00:39:09.409
If you say it in kindness, your husband will love you all the more.

00:39:09.409 --> 00:39:14.260
Finally, let's read verse 30.

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:19.260
Charm, maybe faults, beauty, maybe fleeting.

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:23.260
But the woman who fears Jehovah will be praised.

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:32.260
See, above all, a capable wife who fears Jehovah is highly valued and is to be praised.

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:38.260
So you, dear wives, who feared Jehovah, you worship him with all and respect.

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:45.260
And that's so important because that helps you to easily be in subjection to your husband

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:51.699
because you know that this pleases your Heavenly Father.

00:39:51.699 --> 00:40:00.699
So as you watch the following dramatization, notice how the wife rejoices in her husband.

00:40:00.699 --> 00:40:16.610
I was so tired after work, but glad to finally get home until you're going to be kidding me.

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:25.880
You're home, honey.

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:28.880
I knew he had congregation stuff to work on.

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:30.880
But seriously?

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.880
You talk to me?

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:35.880
You were supposed to talk to the girls about this.

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:42.360
They're making it a habit.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:46.360
At first, it upset me he didn't say anything.

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:51.360
But then, I began to think.

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:55.360
It's actually something I've come to love about John.

00:40:55.360 --> 00:41:02.260
His patience.

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:10.239
He doesn't overreact.

00:41:10.239 --> 00:41:17.050
He's thoughtful, concerned.

00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:23.530
He really listens.

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:25.530
It's why he's such a good elder.

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:48.940
We've enjoyed so many blessings together.

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:50.940
Sometimes, I forget.

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:59.099
And I could be more patient.

00:41:59.099 --> 00:42:02.099
You know, honey, you're right.

00:42:02.099 --> 00:42:05.099
This is completely unacceptable.

00:42:05.099 --> 00:42:08.099
I'll talk to the girls as soon as they come through that door.

00:42:08.099 --> 00:42:10.099
Thank you.

00:42:10.099 --> 00:42:14.980
I love you.

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:18.980
Did you notice how the wife rejoiced in her husband?

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:21.980
Well, when she walked into that kitchen, she saw the mess.

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:24.980
She wasn't rejoicing.

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:28.980
And she wanted to say something to her husband, and she did.

00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:30.980
But how did she say it?

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:32.980
Did she yell at him?

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:33.980
No.

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:35.980
She made her point.

00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:37.980
How did the husband react?

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:39.980
He didn't overreact.

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:43.980
He let her think about it, and he thought about it.

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:48.980
And as she thought about it, she thought, you know, he didn't overreact.

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:51.980
That's one of the things I love about my husband.

00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:54.980
He is so patient.

00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:58.980
And then, of course, he talked with her, and they resolved the issue.

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:05.980
So love triumphed over any possible argument or anger.

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:07.980
So continue dear wives.

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:13.980
Relay on Jehovah as you work to make your marriage a delight.

00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:17.980
And Jehovah will bless and help you.

00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:21.980
Brother Gary Bro, a helper to the service committee,

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:24.980
will now present the next talk of this symposium.

00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:30.980
Call of a joy in your family, parents, rejoice in your children.

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:47.820
We're very happy to have hundreds of thousands of children associated with our congregations worldwide.

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:51.820
You can be assured Jehovah loves every one of those children.

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:54.820
Well, how can we say that?

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:59.820
Well, one reason is that every child owes its name to Jehovah God,

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:06.820
because he's the originator of life, and, in fact, the originator of the family unit as well.

00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:13.820
When Jesus was in heaven, he recognized and observed Jehovah's intense love for children.

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:20.820
And when Jesus walked the earth, he reflected those same qualities towards children.

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:29.820
The Psalmist beautifully expresses Jehovah's feelings about children in the 127th Psalm in verse 3.

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:31.820
And let's read that.

00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:38.630
Psalm 127 and verse 3.

00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:43.630
It says, look, sons are an inheritance from Jehovah.

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:47.630
The fruit of the womb is a reward.

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:51.630
So, not only are children a blessing or a reward,

00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:56.630
the scripture indicates that they are an inheritance as well.

00:44:56.630 --> 00:45:01.630
Yes, they are a gift to you from Jehovah.

00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:09.630
A person who hopes to inherit something usually prepares to receive it and then takes good care of it afterwards.

00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:14.630
I'm sure that's exactly what you parents want to do with your children.

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:20.630
While children can bring much joy, they can also cause frustration.

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:28.630
So, the question is, how can you find joy in your children despite living in a stressful world?

00:45:31.579 --> 00:45:37.579
One suggestion is to view your children the way Jehovah does.

00:45:37.579 --> 00:45:41.579
These are special gifts to you from him.

00:45:41.579 --> 00:45:45.579
Love them. Make them feel loved.

00:45:45.579 --> 00:45:50.579
It's not enough for you to know you love your own children. They need to know it.

00:45:50.579 --> 00:45:56.579
They will not know it unless you find ways to show your love to them.

00:45:56.579 --> 00:46:01.579
And as with any gift, there's a responsibility to take care of it.

00:46:01.579 --> 00:46:12.579
If we go back to the 127 Psalm, notice the illustration that King Solomon uses to explain this responsibility.

00:46:12.579 --> 00:46:17.579
It's in verses 4 and 5, Psalm 127, 4 and 5.

00:46:17.579 --> 00:46:27.210
It says, like arrows in the hand of a mighty man, soar the sons of one's youth.

00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:35.460
Happy is the man who fills his quiver with them. They will not be put to shame.

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:41.460
So children are likened to arrows and parents to mighty warriors.

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:47.460
So a warrior will take the arrow and he will carefully aim it so he hits the target.

00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:50.460
What's the same with you parents?

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:57.460
We encourage you carefully direct your children in a way that, so to speak, you hit the target.

00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:04.460
So your children can have a happy fulfilling life of serving Jehovah God.

00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:07.460
So what can help you to do that?

00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:14.460
Pray to Jehovah to help you build and maintain a strong relationship with your children.

00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:21.460
This closeness will help them to respond favorably to your good direction.

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:30.460
Yes, the way you treat your children is going to affect not only their future, but your happiness as well.

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:39.460
Now, there are five suggestions that might be of assistance and building and maintaining this strong relationship with your children.

00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:45.460
The first one, tell your children you love them.

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:48.460
Or you might say, well, that's not the way I was raised.

00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:58.460
Well, maybe not, but learn from the example of Jehovah God because Jehovah openly expressed his affection for his son, Jesus.

00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:07.460
And no matter how you were brought up, learn to express openly your feelings towards your children.

00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:10.460
One father said this,

00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:15.460
I have found that children are a bit like some flowers.

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:30.960
Just as these little plants turn toward the sun to receive light and warmth, children look to their parents for love and for reassurance that they are welcome members of the family.

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:35.960
They don't make your children have to ask you, mom, dad, do you love me?

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:45.369
No, on a regular basis, let your words support the fact that you love them.

00:48:45.369 --> 00:48:53.369
Now, another way to build a strong relationship with your children is to give them your time.

00:48:53.369 --> 00:48:56.369
That's going to be a challenge in the world we're living in now.

00:48:56.369 --> 00:49:00.369
But don't you think your children are worth meeting that challenge?

00:49:00.369 --> 00:49:10.369
It's going to require good organization on your part and maybe even making some sacrifices, giving up some things that you enjoy doing.

00:49:10.369 --> 00:49:19.369
But spend a lot of time talking to your children, eating with your children, playing with your children.

00:49:19.369 --> 00:49:26.369
It's up to you parents to figure out how you can give your time to your children.

00:49:27.369 --> 00:49:31.369
A mother once asked her children,

00:49:31.369 --> 00:49:37.369
if you could have anything you wanted, what would you like most?

00:49:37.369 --> 00:49:43.369
All four responded, more time with mom and dad.

00:49:43.369 --> 00:49:51.369
Yes, so show your children how important they are to you by spending time with them.

00:49:51.369 --> 00:49:59.369
But you know, there's more than necessary just to physically be around them that leads us to our third suggestion.

00:49:59.369 --> 00:50:04.369
Listen to your children and acknowledge their feelings.

00:50:04.369 --> 00:50:09.369
So when communicating with your children, don't dominate the conversations.

00:50:09.369 --> 00:50:14.369
Let them talk, listen carefully and respectfully.

00:50:14.369 --> 00:50:17.369
Try to understand how they feel.

00:50:17.369 --> 00:50:24.369
And when they express themselves and their emotions, their thoughts and sometimes and maybe in extreme terms,

00:50:24.369 --> 00:50:28.369
well, don't respond in a similar way.

00:50:28.369 --> 00:50:31.369
Proverbs 16, 23 says,

00:50:31.369 --> 00:50:36.369
The heart of the wise one gives his mouth insight.

00:50:36.369 --> 00:50:46.369
So parents, work hard at patiently trying to understand why your child feels the way they do and how you can be of help.

00:50:47.369 --> 00:50:51.710
One father expressed the matter this way.

00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:56.710
Since Jehovah allows me to pour out my heart to him in prayer,

00:50:56.710 --> 00:51:06.710
I think it is only fair that I allow my children to pour out their positive and negative feelings to me.

00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:12.710
Also, listen to your children and acknowledge their feelings.

00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:23.710
Now, the fourth suggestion that may help to maintain a strong relationship with your children is do not expect them to be adults.

00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:33.710
Remember, the Bible says, through use, a person's perceptive powers are trained to distinguish between right and wrong.

00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:36.710
Well, that's going to take time.

00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:46.710
The Bible also speaks of the trait of the babe, the foolishness of boyhood, and the vanity of adolescence.

00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:57.710
So as your children are going through these various stages, recognize their limitations and don't expect them to be little adults.

00:51:58.710 --> 00:52:06.710
Now, the fifth suggestion, when disciplining your children, always show love and discernment.

00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:21.710
Now, this is supported by Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 4, because there it tells parents not to be irritating your children, but to bring them up in the discipline and admonition of Jehovah.

00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:28.710
It says, no secret formulas are how to accomplish this, especially since every child is different.

00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:38.710
So parents, we encourage you give thought to the manner of your discipline, always showing love and discernment.

00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:50.710
So there are five suggestions that will help you to build a strong relationship with your children that will help them to respond to your good training.

00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:56.820
Now, what effect will that have upon you parents?

00:52:56.820 --> 00:53:04.820
Well, please read with me Proverbs chapter 23 and 24 and 25.

00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:10.820
Proverbs 23, 24 and 25.

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:15.820
It says, the father of a righteous one will surely be joyful.

00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:27.820
Whoever father is a wise son will rejoice in him. Your father and your mother will rejoice, and she who gave birth to you will be joyful.

00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:38.820
So the greatest joy that a parent can have is to see their children turn out to be righteous and wise servants of Jehovah God.

00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:50.820
It's going to take time and effort on your part to accomplish that, but we encourage you don't give up on these precious gifts that you have received from Jehovah.

00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:58.820
Have you watched the following dramatization? Notice how the parents rejoice in their children.

00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:02.820
Thank you. I love you.

00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:06.289
I love you too.

00:54:06.289 --> 00:54:07.289
Show time.

00:54:07.289 --> 00:54:10.289
So the fire drill went off right when we ran out of access to him.

00:54:10.289 --> 00:54:18.530
Him, I'm death. Got a shower before us then.

00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:19.530
Girls.

00:54:19.530 --> 00:54:20.530
Okay.

00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:21.530
You need to finish the kitchen now.

00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:23.530
No, we don't have any time. We just got home.

00:54:23.530 --> 00:54:24.530
Yeah, I think we've been for 15 minutes.

00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:26.530
No discussion. No excuses.

00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:28.530
Now.

00:54:28.530 --> 00:54:38.500
Okay. Thanks.

00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:42.500
I did tell them to leave the kitchen spotless, didn't I?

00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:47.300
Yeah. They needed to hear that.

00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:49.300
True.

00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:54.300
It's just overall, they are.

00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:57.300
I know. I know.

00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:05.889
They were actually pioneering during the circuit overseer's visit.

00:55:05.889 --> 00:55:15.219
They really put themselves out for others.

00:55:15.219 --> 00:55:19.860
Including you. I mean us.

00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:44.190
Ever want to take them for granted?

00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:52.059
Girls. I felt the big mess earlier.

00:55:52.059 --> 00:55:54.059
Thanks for cleaning that up.

00:55:54.059 --> 00:55:58.059
Your mom and I, we were upset.

00:55:58.059 --> 00:56:03.380
But we really want you to know that...

00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:05.380
You are gifts from Jehovah.

00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:08.380
Precious gifts. We both cherish.

00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:10.380
We love you very much.

00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:12.380
What your mom said.

00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:26.300
Did you notice how the parents rejoiced in their children?

00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:30.300
Even though the daughters needed some counsel and some discipline,

00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:33.300
it didn't overshadow all their good qualities.

00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:40.300
No, but these parents made comments like they never wanted to take the girls for granted.

00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:43.300
And they cherished these girls.

00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:47.300
In fact, they openly expressed that they loved them.

00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:52.300
It was apparent this family had cultivated joy.

00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:56.300
And we're confident that you as parents also were working hard

00:56:56.300 --> 00:57:00.300
at cultivating joy in your family.

00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:05.300
The things that will help you is to be sure to tell your children you love them.

00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:11.300
Give them your time, listen to them, acknowledge their feelings.

00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:19.300
Don't expect them to be adults and train them with love and discernment.

00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:24.300
These suggestions are going to help you to aim your children

00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:28.300
to an everlasting future of serving Jehovah God.

00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:33.300
And as you put forth all this effort to assist your children,

00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:38.300
you'll be able to rejoice in them these precious gifts

00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:41.300
that you have inherited from Jehovah.

00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:46.769
Brother Ronald Kerzan, a helper to the Teaching Committee,

00:57:46.769 --> 00:57:50.769
will now present the final talk of this symposium.

00:57:50.769 --> 00:57:56.769
Cultivate joy in your family, young ones, rejoice in your parents.

00:57:56.769 --> 00:58:09.650
This symposium has helped us to appreciate even more Jehovah's love for families.

00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:12.650
And we appreciate this gift, the Bible,

00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:20.650
which could serve as a blueprint for families to have a loving, warm, safe environment.

00:58:20.650 --> 00:58:27.650
And you, young ones, you play a vital role in contributing to the joy in your family life.

00:58:27.650 --> 00:58:31.650
Your mother, your father, they love you very much.

00:58:31.650 --> 00:58:36.650
And they want to have a close, personal, loving relationship with you.

00:58:36.650 --> 00:58:43.650
And it's their heartfelt desire that you have a close, personal, loving relationship

00:58:43.650 --> 00:58:45.650
with your Heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:52.650
They want you to be happy now and for the rest of your life, everlasting life.

00:58:52.650 --> 00:58:59.650
In the previous talk, we understood how Jehovah wants parents to train their children.

00:58:59.650 --> 00:59:01.650
But with what purpose?

00:59:01.650 --> 00:59:09.650
Notice what Proverbs chapter 22 and verse 6 gives us instructions for parents.

00:59:09.650 --> 00:59:12.650
They're in verse 6, it reads,

00:59:12.650 --> 00:59:19.650
train a boy, or the footnote says, child or youth, in the way he should go.

00:59:19.650 --> 00:59:24.650
Even when he grows old, he will not depart from it.

00:59:24.650 --> 00:59:28.650
So what is Jehovah asking of your parents?

00:59:28.650 --> 00:59:30.650
To train you.

00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:38.650
To train you in such a way that you will always serve Jehovah from your youth all the way to your adulthood.

00:59:38.650 --> 00:59:41.650
And really, for the rest of your life.

00:59:41.650 --> 00:59:49.650
So Jehovah doesn't spell out every single detail for parents on how they should instruct you and how they should train you.

00:59:49.650 --> 00:59:51.650
That's left up to them.

00:59:51.650 --> 00:59:57.650
And so they need to prayerfully think about what would be best for your family and for you as a child.

00:59:57.650 --> 00:59:59.650
Personally.

00:59:59.650 --> 01:00:02.650
This means that they will make house rules.

01:00:02.650 --> 01:00:06.650
Sometimes you'll get chores, maybe curfews.

01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:09.650
You will get reminders, correction and discipline.

01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:11.650
Why?

01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:13.650
Because they love you.

01:00:13.650 --> 01:00:17.650
And because they're doing their best to listen and obey Jehovah.

01:00:17.650 --> 01:00:25.650
And his instructions are to train you, discipline you, so you can serve Jehovah forever.

01:00:25.650 --> 01:00:27.650
It's not an easy assignment.

01:00:27.650 --> 01:00:33.650
They need all the help that they can get from Jehovah as well as from you.

01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:36.650
Especially when they make rules that you may not like.

01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:39.650
What you can and cannot wear.

01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:41.650
What you can and cannot listen to or watch.

01:00:41.650 --> 01:00:44.650
Or who you pick as close friends.

01:00:44.650 --> 01:00:47.650
These are decisions that are left to your parents.

01:00:47.650 --> 01:00:52.650
Now will your parents always make the perfect decision, the perfect rule?

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:53.650
No.

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:55.650
Breaking news.

01:00:55.650 --> 01:00:59.650
It's not news to you that they will make mistakes.

01:00:59.650 --> 01:01:01.650
They're imperfect.

01:01:01.650 --> 01:01:07.650
But they love you and they're doing the best they can to give you the best training possible.

01:01:07.650 --> 01:01:11.650
So you can love Jehovah and serve him forever.

01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:16.650
We know that you love and appreciate all that your parents do for you.

01:01:16.650 --> 01:01:18.650
But let's be real.

01:01:18.650 --> 01:01:22.650
Sometimes you don't understand the reason for the rule.

01:01:22.650 --> 01:01:25.650
Or you simply don't agree with it.

01:01:25.650 --> 01:01:26.650
What do you do?

01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:28.650
Well, you get frustrated.

01:01:28.650 --> 01:01:30.650
But that's okay.

01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:31.650
We've been there.

01:01:31.650 --> 01:01:36.650
We were your age at one time and we completely understand that it could be frustrating.

01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:41.650
But we know that this will pass because you'll understand why they're doing this.

01:01:41.650 --> 01:01:43.650
It's out of love.

01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:49.650
So when you don't see eye to eye, what are you supposed to do?

01:01:49.650 --> 01:01:52.650
Sometimes you need to change your view.

01:01:52.650 --> 01:01:57.650
A much has to do with how you view your parents.

01:01:57.650 --> 01:02:05.650
How you view your mother and your father will affect how much or how little you respect them.

01:02:05.650 --> 01:02:09.650
Listen to them and obey them.

01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:12.650
And here's a question we'd like to pose to you children.

01:02:12.650 --> 01:02:20.650
Do you sometimes view your parents as prison guards or lifeguards?

01:02:20.650 --> 01:02:22.650
Interesting question.

01:02:22.650 --> 01:02:28.650
Prison guards are trained to keep a close watch over prisoners because they don't really trust them.

01:02:28.650 --> 01:02:32.650
They keep them confined with many restrictions.

01:02:32.650 --> 01:02:35.650
They tell them what to do and when to do it.

01:02:35.650 --> 01:02:38.650
When to get up and when to go to sleep.

01:02:38.650 --> 01:02:41.650
What they will eat and when they will eat.

01:02:41.650 --> 01:02:44.650
What they will wear and all kinds of other rules.

01:02:44.650 --> 01:02:48.650
They keep all these restrictions because they don't trust them.

01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:53.650
Do you view your parents as prison guards at times?

01:02:53.650 --> 01:02:58.650
Well, you might, especially if you want more freedom, more independence.

01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:04.650
And if it seems like they don't really trust you, they're watching every single move that you make.

01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:09.650
You might feel confined because of all the rules and restrictions.

01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:12.650
What about lifeguards?

01:03:12.650 --> 01:03:14.650
Well, lifeguards also watch people.

01:03:14.650 --> 01:03:17.650
They watch swimmers but for a very different reason.

01:03:17.650 --> 01:03:19.650
They want to keep them safe.

01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:22.650
They want to make sure that they do not swim into danger.

01:03:22.650 --> 01:03:27.650
So from their lifeguard tower, they keep a close watch over all the swimmers.

01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:31.650
Sometimes they will use their whistle to warn you of danger.

01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:37.650
To keep away from riptides or maybe sharks, things that you're not aware of.

01:03:37.650 --> 01:03:41.650
Do you view your parents as lifeguards?

01:03:41.650 --> 01:03:44.650
We hope so because they are.

01:03:44.650 --> 01:03:49.650
It's been said that you could spend years wishing your parents would get off your back

01:03:49.650 --> 01:03:55.650
only to realize that they're the only ones who ever really had your back.

01:03:55.650 --> 01:04:00.650
Yes, your parents like lifeguards are looking out for your best interest.

01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:05.650
They've always had your back and they always will.

01:04:05.650 --> 01:04:11.650
They want to make sure that you avoid being drawn into the dangerous currents in this wicked world.

01:04:11.650 --> 01:04:15.650
Dangerous that you may not be aware of.

01:04:15.650 --> 01:04:18.650
Do you want to be happier?

01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:21.650
Do you want to have more trust from your parents?

01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:23.650
More freedom, more independence?

01:04:23.650 --> 01:04:28.650
If so, you might have to change your view of your parents.

01:04:28.650 --> 01:04:32.650
And don't view them in a negative way like their prison guards,

01:04:32.650 --> 01:04:38.650
but view them like lifeguards, safe guarding your life.

01:04:38.650 --> 01:04:44.650
Your parents love you very much and their training will pay off if you listen.

01:04:44.650 --> 01:04:47.650
And that's what Jehovah is asking you to do.

01:04:47.650 --> 01:04:52.650
While your parents are training you, you need to do your part and that is listen.

01:04:52.650 --> 01:04:59.650
And that's what our scripture at Proverbs chapter 23 has for an assignment for you.

01:04:59.650 --> 01:05:04.650
That's chapter 23 of Proverbs in verse 22.

01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:11.650
And their verse 22 says to your children, listen to your father who caused your birth

01:05:11.650 --> 01:05:18.650
and do not despise or dislike your mother just because she has grown old.

01:05:18.650 --> 01:05:24.650
So, although it's not easy at times, what is Jehovah asking of you?

01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:29.650
As your parents are training you, please listen to them.

01:05:29.650 --> 01:05:32.650
But what does it mean to listen?

01:05:32.650 --> 01:05:35.650
Listen is more than just hearing words.

01:05:35.650 --> 01:05:40.650
It's hearing with a view to obey.

01:05:40.650 --> 01:05:46.650
Listening to your mother and your father means giving them your full attention,

01:05:46.650 --> 01:05:49.650
divided attention.

01:05:49.650 --> 01:05:54.650
It means turning off your music, taking out your earbuds,

01:05:54.650 --> 01:06:01.650
putting away your phone and avoiding rolling your eyes when they're speaking to you.

01:06:01.650 --> 01:06:05.650
At times you may get frustrated, you may get upset.

01:06:05.650 --> 01:06:08.650
That's understandable. We all do.

01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:14.650
But how you control your emotions will affect the outcome in the future.

01:06:14.650 --> 01:06:20.650
By listening and obeying your parents, you are building a record of trust

01:06:20.650 --> 01:06:24.650
that will help you in the future when you need to communicate with them.

01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:26.650
Maybe about rules.

01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:30.650
Remember, trust is something that you earn.

01:06:30.650 --> 01:06:35.650
It's not something that you demand or that's automatic.

01:06:35.650 --> 01:06:41.650
What is the best way for you to speak to your parents about rules that you don't understand

01:06:41.650 --> 01:06:44.650
or maybe that you don't agree with?

01:06:44.650 --> 01:06:46.650
You need to communicate.

01:06:46.650 --> 01:06:49.650
Good, open communication.

01:06:49.650 --> 01:06:55.650
Communication doesn't mean complaining, shouting, whining.

01:06:55.650 --> 01:06:58.650
Maybe replying with sarcasm.

01:06:58.650 --> 01:07:00.650
It means calmly.

01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:03.650
Tell your parents how you feel.

01:07:03.650 --> 01:07:06.650
Tell them what's on your mind.

01:07:06.650 --> 01:07:10.650
The following Bible verse helps if we can apply it.

01:07:10.650 --> 01:07:15.650
Verse 29-11 says, a stupid person gives vent to all his feelings.

01:07:15.650 --> 01:07:17.650
It's out of control. No control.

01:07:17.650 --> 01:07:22.650
But the wise one calmly keeps them in check.

01:07:22.650 --> 01:07:24.650
In control.

01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:27.650
That's what we want to try to follow.

01:07:27.650 --> 01:07:31.650
A young woman named Devon tried to do this and this is what she advises.

01:07:31.650 --> 01:07:37.650
She says, I found that when I stayed calm and presented my thoughts clearly,

01:07:37.650 --> 01:07:42.650
I could counter my parents to listen and either to reason with me on their decision

01:07:42.650 --> 01:07:46.650
or to come up with another solution.

01:07:46.650 --> 01:07:50.650
Parents appreciate having a real conversation with their children

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:55.650
rather than screaming matches that end up with slamming doors.

01:07:55.650 --> 01:07:58.650
Open communication is what's needed.

01:07:58.650 --> 01:08:02.650
So you, young ones, what have we learned?

01:08:02.650 --> 01:08:05.650
We have learned how to view our parents correctly.

01:08:05.650 --> 01:08:11.650
Not as a prison guard, but as a lifeguard who really wants to save your life.

01:08:11.650 --> 01:08:13.650
You're everlasting life.

01:08:13.650 --> 01:08:16.649
They have your back and they always will.

01:08:16.649 --> 01:08:20.649
Listening and obeying strengthens your relationship with your parents

01:08:20.649 --> 01:08:23.649
as well as your Heavenly Father, Jehovah.

01:08:23.649 --> 01:08:27.649
It brings you joy and brings joy to your parents.

01:08:27.649 --> 01:08:31.649
And as you apply the training that your parents are giving to you,

01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:36.649
you will gain wisdom that will help you now to make wise decisions

01:08:36.649 --> 01:08:39.649
so that you can have their real life.

01:08:39.649 --> 01:08:42.649
Yes, everlasting life.

01:08:42.649 --> 01:08:46.649
As you watch the concluding video of this symposium,

01:08:46.649 --> 01:08:52.649
please notice how these children find joy in their parents.

01:08:52.649 --> 01:08:56.649
Man, I'm so happy today because that fighter interrupted our mantis

01:08:56.649 --> 01:08:58.649
but we have to do it tomorrow.

01:08:59.649 --> 01:09:04.439
Hey, Mom's dad got a shower before our study.

01:09:04.439 --> 01:09:08.439
No discussion, no excuses, now.

01:09:08.439 --> 01:09:09.439
Okay.

01:09:09.439 --> 01:09:15.180
Where did all of this come from?

01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:17.180
We're going to be here all night.

01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:28.340
It did give us time to think.

01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:38.729
They are such good examples.

01:09:38.729 --> 01:09:50.170
Mom never stops working.

01:09:50.170 --> 01:09:56.220
And our home is always, always beautiful.

01:09:56.220 --> 01:10:09.569
They give us so much of their time and themselves.

01:10:09.569 --> 01:10:15.569
A bit cheesy sometimes, but overall, they're pretty great.

01:10:15.569 --> 01:10:20.489
That night, they didn't lecture us.

01:10:20.489 --> 01:10:25.489
They just reminded us of one thing and it was pretty deep.

01:10:25.489 --> 01:10:32.489
When we dedicate our lives to Jehovah, our lives includes everything.

01:10:32.489 --> 01:10:38.489
Our time, our resources, our home, our kitchen.

01:10:38.489 --> 01:10:40.489
Yes, our kitchen.

01:10:40.489 --> 01:10:45.489
And how we care for those things, it reflects on him.

01:10:45.489 --> 01:10:48.489
And on us as your parents.

01:10:48.489 --> 01:10:50.489
That kind of sank in.

01:10:50.489 --> 01:10:53.489
I knew I could do better.

01:10:53.489 --> 01:10:56.489
No, Mom, we got this.

01:10:56.489 --> 01:10:58.489
Um, we got this?

01:10:58.489 --> 01:11:01.489
Oh, yeah, we got this.

01:11:01.489 --> 01:11:16.399
Did you notice how the daughters showed respect for their parents?

01:11:16.399 --> 01:11:21.399
They did this by listening and obeying their instructions.

01:11:21.399 --> 01:11:23.399
What was the key?

01:11:23.399 --> 01:11:25.399
It's how they viewed their parents.

01:11:25.399 --> 01:11:30.399
They reflected on their parents' fine example in the ministry at home

01:11:30.399 --> 01:11:34.399
when they would take the time and have the patience to help them,

01:11:34.399 --> 01:11:36.399
to listen to them.

01:11:36.399 --> 01:11:42.399
And they saw the joy on their mother's face as she kept the home clean and tidy.

01:11:42.399 --> 01:11:44.399
What a good example.

01:11:44.399 --> 01:11:50.399
They listened to their parents' advice and then they made personal application.

01:11:50.399 --> 01:11:55.399
They learned that showing respect into family meant helping out with chores,

01:11:55.399 --> 01:11:58.399
even when it meant doing the dishes.

01:11:58.399 --> 01:12:03.399
This made their parents happy and the daughters happy as well.

01:12:03.399 --> 01:12:08.399
In this symposium, we considered how husbands and wives, mothers and fathers,

01:12:08.399 --> 01:12:15.399
and children can all add and contribute to the success of the joy within the family.

01:12:15.399 --> 01:12:21.399
They do this by working together in unity, focusing on the positive things in others

01:12:21.399 --> 01:12:24.399
and having respect for one another.

01:12:24.399 --> 01:12:30.399
Yes, each and the family, if they apply Bible principles, use Jehovah's Blueprint.

01:12:30.399 --> 01:12:34.399
They know that they can have a successful and happy family.

01:12:34.399 --> 01:12:37.399
And most of all, we can make Jehovah happy.

01:12:37.399 --> 01:12:44.399
Give him honor as the designer, the architect, and the creator of all families.

01:12:44.399 --> 01:12:49.130
Thank you, brothers, for sharing that practical counsel.

01:12:49.130 --> 01:12:55.130
May all family members continue to strengthen their love and appreciation for one another.

01:12:55.130 --> 01:13:00.130
We now invite you to stand and sing song number 135, entitled,

01:13:00.130 --> 01:13:05.130
Jehovah's Warm Appeal, Be Wise My Son.

01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:08.130
After the song, there will be some announcements.

01:13:08.130 --> 01:13:10.130
And if you wish, you may remain standing.

01:13:10.130 --> 01:13:13.130
Again, that song number 135.
