00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:09.660
A new generation of Israelites gathered before Moses as he gives his parting counsel.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:17.019
And in the crowd is an older, seasoned spiritual man, Caleb.

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:24.260
Now Deuteronomy chapter 1 records what Moses recalls at that time.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.019
He's talking about events that occurred some 40 years earlier when they were near the

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.380
promised land the first time.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.740
What is Moses recall?

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:41.420
Verses 20 and 21, he reminds them the back then Jehovah gave the land to Israel, and they

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.060
were to take courage and take the land.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.060
Do not be afraid.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.060
Then what happened?

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.820
Well, let's start at verse 22.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.340
However, all of you approached me and said, let us send men ahead of us to search out

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.979
the land for us and bring word back to us as to what root we should take and what kind

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:01.859
of cities will encounter.

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.140
The suggestions seemed good to me.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.019
So I selected 12 of your men, one for each tribe.

00:01:08.019 --> 00:01:15.099
They left and went up into the mountainous region and reached the valley of Eschol and

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:17.980
spied it out.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:25.700
Of all the places that the spies saw, why does Moses recall Eschol some 40 years later?

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.299
What happened there?

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.299
What is Eschol?

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.900
Well, we got to go back to when the event occurred.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.540
There's more information in Numbers chapter 13 and verse 20, Jehovah gave more instruction

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.540
to the spies.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.340
He says, go, take courage and take some of the footage of the land.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.140
And then it notes that it was the season of the first ripe grapes.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.489
So in effect, Jehovah is saying, you can go and bring back grapes.

00:01:56.489 --> 00:02:04.450
Now when the spies reach just north of Hebron, they see a valley of vineyards.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.370
They call it Eschol.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.430
It means cluster of grapes.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.030
Vineyards in that region are still known for their high quality of grape today.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.900
One cluster weighed in at 20 kilograms, that's 44 pounds.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.210
So why does Jehovah tell them bring back grapes from Eschol?

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.370
It wasn't for the twelve spies.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.849
They saw the land.

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:42.210
It was proof to all Israel that indeed Jehovah had given them this good land.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:50.020
And Caleb, full of faith, knew that they could take the land then and there.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:57.139
But in a lack of faith, ten spies disheartened the nation, casting the grapes aside as it

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:58.139
were.

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.740
They said, we're not going to go up.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:06.699
Then Jehovah determines they'll spend forty years in the wilderness.

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:10.379
Now just think, what's Caleb thinking at this moment?

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:19.150
Forty-year-old Caleb now absorbing the news that his life has changed forever.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.069
What he thought would be a short time into the promised land.

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:29.229
Now he's looking at the prime years of his life spent in the wilderness, not drinking

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:41.460
wine, eating more manna, raising his family there, growing old alongside his brothers who

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.550
were to blame for this sad turn of events.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:54.659
What will help Caleb cope with this unwelcome change of assignment?

00:03:54.659 --> 00:04:03.219
He hears Moses tell him two things, Deuteronomy 1, 31, the first thing he hears.

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:10.300
And you saw in the wilderness how Jehovah your God carried you, just as a man carries his

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.500
son.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.500
What does Moses mean?

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.500
When was this?

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.860
Well, he said it at the time when they just finished a year or so in the wilderness, when

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.220
they left Egypt, and most of the time at Mount Sinai.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.300
It was a momentous year.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.420
They became a dedicated nation to Jehovah.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:36.220
They got a new tabernacle, new law covenant, a new priesthood, now life centers around worship

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.500
of Jehovah.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:48.100
In this way, Jehovah carried them spiritually through that year, not just physically.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.339
So now Caleb has a choice.

00:04:51.339 --> 00:05:01.540
How he spend the next 39 years, growing bitter in disappointment, just waiting out the time,

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.850
or would he let Jehovah carry him spiritually?

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:12.899
He wouldn't see many miracles in the years to come, like he did in the first year.

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:18.100
But he could read and meditate on God's law, and he would come to know Jehovah on a much

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.379
deeper level.

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:30.819
He would grow in love, grow in trust, grow in patience.

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:32.540
That was the first thing.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.259
Jehovah can carry me spiritually.

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:42.620
Second thing, verse 35, none of Caleb's generation would enter the Promised Land, except for

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:49.220
a few, but here he hears his name in verse 36, except Caleb, the son of Jaffana, he will

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:55.819
see it, and I will give the land on which he walked to him and to his sons.

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:57.939
Now Caleb has a personal promise.

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:11.500
He will once again return to the vineyards, the grapes of Eschol, intended to benefit Israel,

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.300
now take on a new meaning for Caleb.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:24.339
So how do you think he will recall his experience at Eschol over the years, a bitter, distant

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:25.339
memory?

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:28.439
Don't talk to me about Eschol.

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:35.680
Or would he recall that experience fondly, saying, not everything in my life has changed?

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.000
The grapes are still there, growing bountifully.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.920
I saw them.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:45.199
The land still flowing with milk and honey, Jehovah's promise still unchanged, and now more

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:50.670
personal to me than ever.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.149
So what did these two things do for Caleb?

00:06:54.149 --> 00:06:57.649
Well, let's look at the man after 40 years in the wilderness.

00:06:57.649 --> 00:06:59.149
What do we see?

00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:07.959
He's still grateful for the manna, not calling it contemptible, as others did.

00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:14.680
He didn't become bitter over his brother's weaknesses as others had.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:23.379
He didn't fall into immorality with the moorbite and the midnight women, as thousands did.

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:28.220
When Joshua, his contemporary, was appointed as Moses' successor, Caleb supported him whole

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.220
heartedly.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.420
No envy.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:36.420
And when they did enter the promised land, Caleb spent six more years helping his brothers

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.220
secure their inheritance first.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:43.069
That is a spiritual man.

00:07:43.069 --> 00:07:47.629
Caleb didn't just grow old in his assignment.

00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:50.430
He grew in faith.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:55.870
To the point where 85-year-old Caleb now takes on the toughest of assignments, fighting the

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.069
anachim in Hebron.

00:07:58.069 --> 00:08:05.110
Yes, Hebron, he inherits the city and the mountainous regions surrounding it, could that involve

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:09.069
the very valley of Eschol?

00:08:09.069 --> 00:08:10.709
If so, can you picture Caleb?

00:08:10.709 --> 00:08:16.870
Once again, walking through the vineyards, a land on which he walked some 45 years earlier,

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:25.300
so grateful he let Jehovah carry him spiritually through his assignment.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.379
You have a nice assignment.

00:08:28.379 --> 00:08:33.899
The land to which you're going to is a very good land.

00:08:33.899 --> 00:08:41.259
Bring the grapes of Eschol with you, fortify, stabilize the brothers and sisters.

00:08:41.259 --> 00:08:51.009
But remember, when you face your trials, that's when you recall Eschol for yourself.

00:08:51.009 --> 00:08:54.090
What will be your Eschol?

00:08:54.090 --> 00:09:00.250
Well, that depends on the trial.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:08.210
But you will recall Bible lessons you learned here that equal any trial that you face there.

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:18.460
For example, you may detect spiritual fatigue setting in and frustration.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.980
You don't ignore that.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:27.980
As much as Caleb would love a glass of wine from Eschol, what he needed was mana.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:29.700
He didn't call it contemptible.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.659
It sustained him daily.

00:09:31.659 --> 00:09:36.419
You too, you appreciate the basic yet very necessary things.

00:09:36.419 --> 00:09:39.259
You're not above them now.

00:09:39.259 --> 00:09:44.340
The humble task of daily Bible reading and meditation.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:52.139
The simple act of listening at a congregation meeting, looking for counsel, you need to

00:09:52.139 --> 00:09:55.789
say strong.

00:09:55.789 --> 00:10:07.690
And when tempted to do wrong, you recall that you add to your faith virtue, yes, virtue

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:18.850
that wholesome aspect where like Caleb and Phineas, you act quickly to kill any desire, tolerating

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:23.129
no rivalry in your heart.

00:10:23.129 --> 00:10:30.929
And when you detect envy and contention growing, you recall that these traits are earthly

00:10:30.929 --> 00:10:33.769
demonic, not the wisdom from above.

00:10:33.769 --> 00:10:39.370
So you protect that different spirit and you choose the path that leads to peace and

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:44.090
unity instead.

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:49.730
Let your experience here not become a distant memory.

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:53.570
Recall Eschol with gratitude.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:57.169
And you're not just recalling a happy feeling you had here in class.

00:10:57.169 --> 00:11:01.850
Know you're walking through the valleys and vineyards of specific Bible accounts that

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:05.169
will fortify you.

00:11:05.169 --> 00:11:12.730
And Jehovah carry you spiritually in your assignment, not just physically.

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:16.210
Keep his promise close to your heart.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:21.970
And you will glorify Jehovah and bear much fruit in the land to which you're going as

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.370
you recall Eschol.
