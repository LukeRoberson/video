00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:31.230
You've found that special someone. You can't believe how compatible you are. Yet you

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:42.259
soon discover that compatible does not mean identical. The Bible describes a

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:49.420
husband and wife as complements, not competitors. A complement completes what

00:00:49.420 --> 00:01:02.420
another may lack. This means your differences can strengthen your marriage. Still,

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:19.040
with two imperfect people, disagreements will happen, but they don't have to

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:29.730
become arguments. If the two of you don't see a matter in the same way, for

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:40.099
example, how to manage money, what should you do? Should you insist until you get

00:01:40.099 --> 00:02:07.379
your way? Say nothing at all. There is a better way to work through the

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:18.340
occasional difference before it becomes a conflict. A Bible principle states,

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.500
let each one keep seeking, not his own advantage, but that of the other person.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.580
You may need to set aside your cherished point of view and really try to see

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:39.020
the value of your mate's perspective. Remember, seek his or her advantage, not

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:48.669
your own. Take each issue one at a time. You may be able to resolve most of your

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:54.189
differences and meet in the middle. With practice, you will learn to tackle your

00:02:54.189 --> 00:03:04.530
disagreements, not each other. This is a skill you will work out for a lifetime

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:12.879
since we all change as we age. For example, what if your viewpoints differ on how

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:47.900
to care for aging parents? Start with your common ground. In addition to the

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.580
financial cost, consider the cost to your time, health and relationship with each

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:05.099
other and with God. Recognize the merits of your spouse's viewpoint and even if

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.939
your differences cannot be solved by a mutual compromise, conceding and

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:16.620
supporting will be a win for your friendship. You might also agree to discuss the

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:24.300
question again at a later date or a circumstances change. Even if you don't

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:31.860
always agree, you can still work as a team. Different viewpoints broaden your

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:38.860
horizons, add colour to your marriage and in the end draw you closer to one another.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:45.579
Here are three questions to discuss that can help you handle situations in your

00:04:45.579 --> 00:04:51.500
marriage where viewpoints differ. If it's convenient, pause this video now and

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.980
really talk.
