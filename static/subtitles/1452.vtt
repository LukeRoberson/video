00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:18.429
Jesus was the perfect example of kindness and understanding.

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:21.429
The prophet Isaiah wrote about him,

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:24.429
no crust read, will he break,

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:28.429
and no smoldering wick will he extinguish.

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.429
He showed love to all who were broken in spirit

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:35.429
and in search of compassion.

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:40.429
Similarly, we aim to show compassion to all

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:43.429
including those in prisons.

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:49.429
Their accounts show why our prison ministry is so needed.

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:55.429
It is a pleasure to share the accomplishments made in this essential work.

00:00:55.429 --> 00:01:01.429
As far back as 1918, there were Bible studies being conducted in prison.

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:06.430
In recent times, there is great emphasis on being proactive,

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.430
really reaching out, trying to speak to prison officials

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.430
so that we can help ones that are in prison,

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.430
that want to have a relationship with the creator.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.430
We recognize that those in prison are serving a sentence for a crime committed.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.430
However, Jehovah wants all sorts of people to come to know him.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.430
The service department organizes the work of contact congregations

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.430
that oversee and support prison ministers.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.430
A congregation is assigned as the contact congregation

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.430
and they obtain the required permits

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.430
and organize the preaching work in the prison.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.430
They also select the publishers who will participate in this preaching activity.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.430
We receive letters from ones in prison.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.430
They express their appreciation for ones visiting them

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.430
and sharing the good news of the kingdom.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.430
And we see ones responding to it and becoming our brothers and sisters.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.430
Those who have accepted the truth and gotten baptized in prison

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.430
have had a powerful influence on others.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.430
They see this individual changing in his actions, his speech and his thinking

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.430
and so they're curious.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.430
What is motivating this change?

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.430
So often they take an interest and then they too may request Bible studies.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.430
Prison systems are different in each country.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.430
Let's see how our brothers have adapted.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.430
Flexibility is needed.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:43.430
It's actually required because all these correctional facilities have different requirements.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.430
They don't always allow brothers and sisters to visit in the prison.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.430
So then you have to look for other ways.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.430
Special campaigns are arranged where our prison ministers meet with prison officials

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.430
to have specific watchtower articles distributed to the inmates.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.430
In some of our prisons we've been able to make arrangements to show the recordings

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.430
of the regional conventions and the assemblies.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.430
And this has had a tremendous effect with many being invited and enjoying those programs.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.430
About 11.5 million people around the world are incarcerated

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.430
and need to learn about God's love for them.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.430
Although many brothers and sisters and local congregations help us,

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.430
it's not always easy.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.430
The reason is that we have to organize our secular work and our family responsibilities.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.430
And sometimes we have to travel long distances.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:44.430
We feel built up and comforted because we see that they value all the efforts that we make.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.430
We value those who volunteer to support this arrangement.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.430
If you live in an area where such a facility is located, can you have a share?

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.430
If so, depending on the gender of those assigned to such a facility,

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.430
could you offer your time and efforts to assist?

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.430
We can all pray for the prisoners who respond favorably to the message

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.430
and for those who teach them.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:22.100
Our brothers and sisters work hard to find and help truth seekers in this unique setting.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.100
What have been the results?

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.100
Living in such a dangerous and controlled environment is not easy.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:37.100
There wasn't a day that went by that I didn't regret who I was, what I was, and where I was at.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.439
It was very painful to just look at myself in the mirror.

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:48.439
It's one of the hardest things being in prison, so that you can't afford to show love.

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:52.439
And you can't expect to get it either.

00:04:52.439 --> 00:05:01.439
When you're incarcerated, the isolation is just overwhelmingly just indescribable.

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:06.439
You feel like death is even better than living.

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:12.439
I was introduced to the truth at a very dark and critical time in my life at the beginning of my incarceration.

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:17.439
I was introduced to the Bible by a fellow image.

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:22.439
I first came in contact with the truth when I was in the county jail.

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:27.439
It was after coming out of solitary confinement, I was moved to a cell,

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:32.439
and I noticed there were some books on the table, some of those books were Bibles.

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:37.439
I was finally moved to a penitentiary where I could speak to one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:40.439
And there I got to know the truth.

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:45.439
We would have meetings there in the prison, and we started studying the Bible.

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:53.439
And learning about Jehovah in a group setting like that with the volunteers was absolutely so wonderful.

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:58.439
It became the highlights of my week.

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:04.439
To those brothers who would come in faithfully every week and study the Bible with me, they showed me love.

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:13.439
I had never seen anyone as kind and loving and caring as they were.

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:18.439
It was a source of encouragement to us, any time that he came.

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:21.439
Studying the Bible had an impact on me right from the start.

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:25.439
I felt calmer and more at peace with myself.

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:32.439
When the truth became real to me, the bars disappeared, the guards disappeared, the concrete.

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:35.439
None of those things mattered anymore.

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:39.439
Because to me, I had purpose in life now, and I was happy.

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:44.439
I could really trust God and be a free man, even if I was still in prison.

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:52.439
I went from wanting to just die, to wanting to be there in God's new world.

00:06:52.439 --> 00:07:03.439
And then to realize that he had made that way, even for me, was just incredible.

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:12.439
First Timothy 2.4 says that Jehovah wants all sorts of people to come to an accurate knowledge of truth.

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:26.439
So we see the crushed reeds and smoldering wicks of this world as Jehovah and Jesus see them full of potential.

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:38.439
Potential to change, potential to grow, potential to become friends of Jehovah.
