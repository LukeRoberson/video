WEBVTT

00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:07.589
We warmly welcome all of you to this month's broadcast.

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:14.589
Here is just a taste of what we can look forward to on the program.

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:20.589
A life spent in the full-time ministry is both exciting and challenging.

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:26.589
We'll meet a brother and his wife who have spent decades in various forms of this service.

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:31.589
What lessons can we learn from their experiences?

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:38.590
Then we'll hear the story of a woman who struggled for years with severe drug addiction.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.590
What would help her eventually break free?

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:52.590
And our new music video will help us feel the brotherly love we enjoy as a part of Jehovah's organization.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:03.590
There's certainly plenty to enjoy on this August 2018 edition of JW Broadcasting.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:30.540
The theme for this month's program is appreciating our gifts and men.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.540
Who of us does not enjoy being given a fine, well-chosen gift?

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:48.540
For example, you brothers, do you not take pleasure in receiving a colorful but tasteful 100% silk tie?

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.540
Are you sisters? Do you not delight in being given an exquisite, charming silk scarf?

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:04.540
But what if you took that silk tie or silk scarf and used it to polish your shoes?

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:12.539
How do you think the giver of your gift would feel if he saw you using his gift in that way?

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:20.539
Obviously, it would be misused and disrespect for the gift and would insult the giver.

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:23.539
What is the point of our illustration?

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:33.539
Will Jehovah and Jesus have given us a fine, well-chosen gift in the form of the elders?

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:45.539
But as we will discuss, all of us must make sure that we always show appreciation and respect for this divine provision.

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:51.539
Please turn to Ephesians chapter 4 and verse 8.

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:59.539
And let's read about this gift that Jehovah and Jesus have given us.

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:12.539
It reads, for it says, when he ascended on high, he carried away captives. He gave gifts in men.

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:21.539
You notice, by means of Jesus' perfect integrity, Jesus conquered Satan and his world.

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:32.539
As a world conqueror, figuratively, he has plundered captives and has given them his gifts to the congregations.

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:35.539
How useful are these gifts in men?

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:39.539
Will please look at verses 11 and 12 for the answer.

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:50.539
And he gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelizers, some as shepherds and teachers.

00:03:50.539 --> 00:04:01.539
With a view to the re-adjustment of the Holy Ones, for ministerial work to build up the body of the Christ.

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:11.539
Notice, they would be evangelizers, taking the lead in the all-important preaching and disciple-making work.

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:17.540
They do not simply say to the publishers, go in the preaching work.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.540
They say, come, come with us.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.540
Let's work together in this never-to-be-repeated work.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:35.540
They are also shepherds, protecting the flock from Satan, the murderer, serpent, dragon, and lion.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:43.540
Additionally, they are teachers, feeding the flock with nourishing spiritual food.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:51.540
But now we ask, how does Jehovah tell us that we should feel about these hard-working gifts in men?

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:58.540
Let's go to 1 Thessalonians chapter 5, and let's get the answer.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.540
1 Thessalonians 5, beginning in verse number 12.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.540
Notice what Jehovah says.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:28.540
Now, we request you, brothers, to show respect for those who are working hard among you and presiding over you in the Lord and at monishing you and to give them extraordinary consideration in love because of their work.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.540
Be peaceable with one another.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:39.540
Notice, we're told to show respect for these dear brothers.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.540
But now, let's move to a vital question.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:52.540
How can we show, demonstrate, that we do deeply respect and appreciate these dear brothers?

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:58.540
The first way, by whole-heartedly cooperating with them.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:05.540
Please turn to Hebrews chapter 13 and verse number 17.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:11.540
In this scripture describes how deep our cooperation should be.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:36.790
Verse 17, be obedient to those who are taking the lead among you and be submissive for they are keeping watch over you as those who will render an account so that they may do this with joy and not with sighing for this would be damaging to you.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.790
Notice, we are told to be obedient.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:46.790
Clearly, this means that we're supposed to comply with or obey what they tell us.

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:53.790
Of course, that would be with a proviso, unless they tell us to do something that is unscriptual.

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.790
And, of course, that would be extremely rare.

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:01.790
We're also told to be submissive.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:12.790
This includes the attitude with which we're to be obedient, doing so with a yielding, positive attitude.

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:17.790
Would it be possible to be obedient, but not submissive?

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:24.790
Well, what if we said, okay, I'll do what the elders suggest.

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:29.790
I don't want to do it, but I'll do it.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.790
We would be obedient, but not submissive.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:39.790
However, Jehovah tells us to display both of these qualities.

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:50.790
We should be obedient and submissive, even if what the elders are asking us to do is not the best, most efficient way to do something.

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:53.790
Permit me to illustrate this point.

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:58.790
Admittedly, the illustration is somewhat exaggerated.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.790
But hopefully, it will make the point.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:09.790
Please imagine that the elders decide that the outside of the kingdom hall needs to be painted,

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:17.790
and that all the publishers will be given a small two-inch paintbrush with which to paint.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:19.790
Now, what could happen?

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:25.790
The publishers could get all upset concerning this request of the elders saying,

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:32.789
it is ridiculous that the elders want us to paint with a small two-inch paintbrush.

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:41.789
Consequently, some could start campaigning for the right for everyone to use a six-inch paintbrush.

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:49.789
Others might campaign for using paint rollers to roll the paint on the kingdom hall.

00:08:49.789 --> 00:09:00.789
Still others might start trying to build support for renting and using a paint sprayer to spray the paint on the kingdom hall.

00:09:00.789 --> 00:09:08.789
In another camp, once might champion the idea of hiring out to a contractor, the painting of the kingdom hall.

00:09:08.789 --> 00:09:16.789
While another group is promoting the idea that the kingdom hall doesn't even need to be painted.

00:09:16.789 --> 00:09:19.789
Now, what would be the outcome?

00:09:19.789 --> 00:09:22.789
The congregation would be divided.

00:09:22.789 --> 00:09:25.789
The kingdom hall would never get painted.

00:09:25.789 --> 00:09:29.789
Publishers could end up stumbled right out of the truth.

00:09:29.789 --> 00:09:32.789
The elders would be very discouraged.

00:09:32.789 --> 00:09:35.789
Jehovah would be sad.

00:09:35.789 --> 00:09:39.789
And Satan would be made very happy.

00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:45.789
On the other hand, what if everyone humbly supported the elders?

00:09:45.789 --> 00:09:52.789
Perhaps thinking there's no scripture that says we can't paint with a two-inch paintbrush?

00:09:52.789 --> 00:10:00.789
In fact, Hebrews 13, 17 tells us to be obedient and submissive to the elders.

00:10:00.789 --> 00:10:04.789
So why don't we go ahead and support the elders?

00:10:04.789 --> 00:10:07.789
Now, what would be the outcome?

00:10:08.789 --> 00:10:11.789
The kingdom hall we get painted.

00:10:11.789 --> 00:10:20.789
The publishers would get to enjoy a lot of good association because they'd be working together for a long time.

00:10:20.789 --> 00:10:23.789
The elders would be very encouraged.

00:10:23.789 --> 00:10:26.789
Satan would be sad.

00:10:26.789 --> 00:10:31.789
And Jehovah's heart would be made glad.

00:10:31.789 --> 00:10:36.789
Well, what is the point of this hyperbole illustration?

00:10:36.789 --> 00:10:44.789
Being obedient and submissive to those taking the lead is much more important than how something is done.

00:10:44.789 --> 00:10:50.789
That is the attitude that Jehovah will richly bless.

00:10:50.789 --> 00:11:00.789
But now, a second way we can demonstrate that we deeply appreciate these dear brothers is to pray for that.

00:11:00.789 --> 00:11:11.789
Please note what the elder Paul urged the brothers to do for him at Romans 15, verse number 30.

00:11:11.789 --> 00:11:13.789
Here Paul said,

00:11:14.789 --> 00:11:31.789
Now, I urge you, brothers, through our Lord Jesus Christ and through the love of the Spirit that you exert yourselves with me in prayers to God for me.

00:11:31.789 --> 00:11:40.789
Paul recognized the power that he would derive as a result of others praying for him.

00:11:40.789 --> 00:11:44.789
And your local elders feel the same way.

00:11:44.789 --> 00:11:59.789
But the question is, in your personal private prayers, do you regularly thank Jehovah for your gifts and men and entreat Jehovah to richly supply them with his powerful Holy Spirit?

00:11:59.789 --> 00:12:09.789
Our answer to that question can reveal much about our appreciation for these hardworking elders.

00:12:09.789 --> 00:12:15.789
Now, let's move to a third way that we can demonstrate deep appreciation.

00:12:15.789 --> 00:12:21.789
We can do so by commending the elders.

00:12:21.789 --> 00:12:24.789
Here is a soul searching question.

00:12:24.789 --> 00:12:29.789
Do you periodically go up to various elders and say something like,

00:12:29.789 --> 00:12:34.789
Brother Elder, we just want to thank you for your hard work.

00:12:34.789 --> 00:12:38.789
Please be assured that we appreciate it.

00:12:38.789 --> 00:12:49.789
However, it seems that some publishers never, ever commend the elders or express appreciation.

00:12:49.789 --> 00:12:55.789
Might this not indicate that we are taking them in their hard work for granted?

00:12:55.789 --> 00:12:59.789
Of course, they will not quit if you do not give them commendation.

00:12:59.789 --> 00:13:03.789
They primarily do their work for Jehovah.

00:13:03.789 --> 00:13:11.789
But if you do express appreciation, believe me, it will be most encouraging to them.

00:13:11.789 --> 00:13:24.789
And even though it may really surprise the elder the very first time you do this, please do not hold back this good from those to whom it is owing.

00:13:24.789 --> 00:13:39.789
Appropriately, Jehovah tells us that Proverbs 327 do not withhold good from those to whom you should give it if it is within your power to help.

00:13:39.789 --> 00:13:47.789
And one thing that will move us to be more aware of commending the elders is to remember all the good work they are doing.

00:13:48.789 --> 00:13:55.789
Many elders are family men who must work securely to provide for their families.

00:13:55.789 --> 00:14:01.789
If he has children, these young ones need time and attention from their father.

00:14:01.789 --> 00:14:10.789
He may need to help them with their schoolwork, as well as schedule time for them to enjoy wholesome recreation.

00:14:10.789 --> 00:14:15.789
Most important, he cares for the spiritual needs of his family.

00:14:16.789 --> 00:14:23.789
Regularly conducting family worship, working with them in the ministry and taking them to meetings.

00:14:23.789 --> 00:14:34.789
But in addition to these numerous responsibilities common to many of us, they have voluminous additional responsibilities as elders.

00:14:34.789 --> 00:14:41.789
And much of the elders' hard work in our behalf is not seen by the congregation.

00:14:42.789 --> 00:14:46.789
For example, you may see an elder giving a part on the meeting.

00:14:46.789 --> 00:14:52.789
What you didn't see are the hours he spent preparing that part.

00:14:52.789 --> 00:15:00.789
How long does it take you to prepare a student assignment on the midweek meeting?

00:15:00.789 --> 00:15:05.789
Some elders have a part every week, sometimes more than one.

00:15:05.789 --> 00:15:16.789
While gaining experience and speaking is certainly helpful, the fact remains that good talks require hard work.

00:15:16.789 --> 00:15:19.789
But that is not all the elders do.

00:15:19.789 --> 00:15:25.789
They have shepherding costs to make, and judicial cases to handle.

00:15:25.789 --> 00:15:38.789
Some elders are also busy helping to build kingdom halls and branch facilities, serving on hospital liaison committees, volunteering at assemblies and conventions.

00:15:38.789 --> 00:15:44.789
And elders do many other things that are too numerous to recount.

00:15:45.789 --> 00:15:50.789
What we see is often only the tip of the iceberg.

00:15:50.789 --> 00:15:56.789
90% of an iceberg is unseen underwater.

00:15:56.789 --> 00:16:07.789
At 2 Timothy 4-6, the Apostle Paul referred to himself as being poured out like a drink offering.

00:16:08.789 --> 00:16:14.789
A drink offering was poured on the altar and went up in smoke.

00:16:14.789 --> 00:16:21.789
That well describes how the elders likewise expend themselves.

00:16:21.789 --> 00:16:31.789
Remembering all of this should move us to regularly offer sincere commendation to our hardworking elders.

00:16:32.789 --> 00:16:41.789
Now, we have discussed ways that we can demonstrate that we deeply appreciate our gifts and men.

00:16:41.789 --> 00:16:47.789
We should, number one, wholeheartedly cooperate with them.

00:16:47.789 --> 00:16:50.789
Number two, pray for them.

00:16:50.789 --> 00:16:53.789
Number three, commend them.

00:16:54.789 --> 00:17:08.789
We will prove that we are not even slightly like an unappreciative recipient of a silk tie or a silk scarf who uses that gift to polish his use.

00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:21.789
To the contrary, we will prove to Jehovah and Jesus that we love respect and appreciate the divine gifts or gifts and men

00:17:21.789 --> 00:17:28.039
that they have so generously given to us.

00:17:28.039 --> 00:17:39.039
But now, what effect can these gifts and men have on individuals who have strayed from Jehovah and his organization?

00:17:39.039 --> 00:17:52.039
What actions show that they are loving shepherds who want to assist these ones to return to Jehovah despite serious struggles or even addictions?

00:17:53.039 --> 00:17:59.319
Let's look for those answers in the following story.

00:17:59.319 --> 00:18:07.319
Turn your life around so that seasons of refreshing may come from Jehovah himself.

00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:13.319
Those words changed my life and they saved the life of my little girl.

00:18:13.319 --> 00:18:30.900
I was raised in a witness family but I chose a dark underworld of practically everything that Jehovah hates.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:45.769
After about 15 years, although financially secure, I was confronted with the failure that my life had become.

00:18:45.769 --> 00:18:51.529
I was trying to raise a child while addicted to drugs.

00:18:51.529 --> 00:18:58.529
I just didn't want to live like that anymore and I wanted to be a good mother.

00:18:58.529 --> 00:19:03.529
So for the first time in years, I prayed to Jehovah.

00:19:03.529 --> 00:19:07.529
The knot came on my door the very next day.

00:19:07.529 --> 00:19:17.789
I began studying with a vengeance.

00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:22.420
I had 15 years to catch up on.

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.420
I had a lot of help.

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:27.420
I progressively changed my lifestyle.

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:32.420
I changed my associates and I conquered my addictions.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:37.420
I slowly began to overcome feelings of worthlessness.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:48.309
So none of these changes were easy to make but it made me feel clean and happy knowing that Jehovah was pleased.

00:19:48.309 --> 00:19:54.309
My burning desire at that point really was to begin sharing with other people what I was learning.

00:19:54.309 --> 00:20:05.309
But I didn't qualify to engage in the public ministry because I was still living with my boyfriend at the time and he didn't understand some of the changes I was making.

00:20:05.309 --> 00:20:17.099
I was determined to turn my life around and overcome this last hurdle that was preventing me from serving Jehovah fully.

00:20:17.099 --> 00:20:23.099
Two weeks later, I found out I was pregnant.

00:20:23.099 --> 00:20:33.099
I was devastated. I didn't know what all those people who had helped me, what they would think, and how Jehovah felt about what was happening.

00:20:33.099 --> 00:20:38.589
I was so ashamed.

00:20:38.589 --> 00:20:42.589
I actually blamed Jehovah for letting it happen.

00:20:42.589 --> 00:20:45.589
I was so confused.

00:20:45.589 --> 00:20:51.589
My first inclination was just to get an abortion.

00:20:51.589 --> 00:20:54.589
But deep down I knew that was wrong.

00:20:54.589 --> 00:21:03.349
I thought now everyone would know that I'm still the worthless person that I always knew I was.

00:21:03.349 --> 00:21:08.299
At that point I just felt like giving up.

00:21:08.299 --> 00:21:14.299
I told my aunt and uncle, who are Jehovah's Witnesses, about my situation.

00:21:14.299 --> 00:21:23.299
They didn't judge me at all but they did offer a curious suggestion. They invited me up to Bethel for a visit.

00:21:23.299 --> 00:21:30.299
They introduced me to an elder who was very kind and I talked to him about my situation.

00:21:30.299 --> 00:21:38.299
I was shocked by how loving he was, so he shared with me Acts 319.

00:21:38.299 --> 00:21:42.299
Repent, therefore, and turn around.

00:21:42.299 --> 00:21:51.299
So as to get your sins blotted out, that seasons of refreshing may come from the person of Jehovah.

00:21:52.299 --> 00:21:57.299
Well, he told me, I had already sinned, but why should I sin a second time?

00:21:57.299 --> 00:22:01.299
Why should this innocent child pay for what I had done wrong?

00:22:01.299 --> 00:22:11.299
He suggested I teach my baby about Jehovah and raise the child up to know him and have a friendship with him.

00:22:11.299 --> 00:22:20.299
I loved that he took something that was sad and depressing for me and turned it into something beautiful.

00:22:21.299 --> 00:22:28.299
Well, I had a new plan now. I was really determined to do everything I had to do to turn my life around in order to please Jehovah.

00:22:28.299 --> 00:22:36.299
So eventually I qualified to become an unbaptized publisher and later I was baptized in 2010.

00:22:36.299 --> 00:22:40.299
I gave birth to a healthy baby girl.

00:22:40.299 --> 00:22:47.299
I already dedicated my life to Jehovah, so two of my goals are to get baptized and pioneered.

00:22:47.299 --> 00:22:55.299
I'm as determined as ever to raise Julie up to love Jehovah and to avoid the traps that almost cost us our lives.

00:22:55.299 --> 00:23:21.710
Describing our elders, Isaiah 322 reads, and each one will be like a hiding place from the wind, a place of concealment from the rainstorm, like streams of water in a waterless land.

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:28.710
Like the shadow of a massive crag in a parched land.

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:34.710
Did you note two key ways our gifts and men did that?

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:41.710
One, the elder she met at Bethel was kind and approachable.

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:46.710
He made her feel comfortable to express herself.

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:55.710
Two, he lovingly used the Bible to help her make a wise decision and avoid further calamity.

00:23:55.710 --> 00:24:05.710
This is an excellent example of how elders can help ones who are struggling spiritually.

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:14.710
But in what other ways can elders be an example in their zeal for the ministry?

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:19.710
But what if weather conditions in our territory make this difficult?

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:27.710
When the elders take the lead, the rest of the congregation respond in the same way.

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:47.880
The example of those preaching in the Pharaoh Islands will offer some encouraging tips.

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:52.880
The Pharaoh Islands are also called the land of maybe.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:57.880
The weather is very diverse and can rapidly change.

00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:06.880
So when you begin in the ministry, the weather can be sunny and then 10 minutes later, you find yourself in a massive rain shower and everything gets wet.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:10.880
When this another challenge, we have some severe winter storms.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:20.630
So you have to be careful that your service partner or the car door doesn't blow away while you're getting out of the car.

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:24.630
We make sure to wear clothes appropriate for the weather.

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:34.630
And also to keep updated on the weather situation and to see where in your territory the weather is most suitable and then adapt.

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:38.630
If the weather is nice, then we try to go from house to house.

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:47.630
And if the weather is bad, then you can go on calls where you can come inside, meaning weather will invite you in or where the entrance is covered.

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:54.630
And you can plan your ministry so that if the weather gets bad, you can take visits that you know will be at home that time of day.

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:59.170
When the weather is poor, it's good to adjust.

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:03.170
Maybe you can do some telephone witnessing or letter writing.

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:11.170
At a meeting for pioneers, an elder reminded us that when the weather is bad, try not to think the weather is bad again.

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:16.170
But instead, yay, now people are actually at home.

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:22.170
It is a good idea to have a plan for whom you'd like to visit and what you'd like to talk to them about.

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:32.170
Because then when it rains or the weather is an ideal, you focus on your plan instead of thinking that now I've been out preaching for five hours in stormy weather.

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:38.170
I think Ecclesiastes 11-4 applies quite well to our territory.

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:45.170
That the one who watches the wind will not so see, and the one who looks at the clouds will not reach.

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:52.170
If we have to wait for the perfect weather conditions to preach, then we wouldn't be out that often.

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:58.170
Something else that helps to endure bad weather is to think of the first publishers in the Faroe Islands.

00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:05.170
They fought with sea sickness, bad weather, and they had to hike over the mountains to visit remote settlements.

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:12.170
They overcame these obstacles, and it motivates me to overcome the challenges I'm facing today.

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:21.170
I remember when we came to the Faroe Islands. I looked out the window and thought, is it even possible to go out in the ministry in this kind of weather?

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:29.170
And then we arrived at the Meeting for Field Service and the friends with children and strollers were there, and we're positive and ready for field service.

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:34.769
It made me think that if they can do it, then I can too.

00:27:34.769 --> 00:27:45.369
So we are a team of publishers and we have the weather as our challenge, and especially when the weather is bad, we encourage one another.

00:27:45.369 --> 00:27:51.369
We really like the song, The Life of a Pioneer. It's an amazing song.

00:27:51.369 --> 00:27:59.539
It says, in the work we endure with a sunshine or rain, because we loved Jehovah.

00:27:59.539 --> 00:28:05.539
We really want people to get to know Jehovah. They need to know the truth.

00:28:05.539 --> 00:28:13.539
When Jesus said that we should preach, I think that He also would have put on a raincoat and gone out to preach the good news.

00:28:13.539 --> 00:28:23.539
We experience how Jehovah blesses our efforts when we go in the ministry, and you especially feel it when you persist in your efforts to preach when the weather isn't good.

00:28:23.539 --> 00:28:29.539
It may be that one day you get a really nice conversation with a person about the Bible.

00:28:29.539 --> 00:28:36.539
I also feel it gives me great joy. Paul said that the one who soes bountifully will also reap bountifully.

00:28:36.539 --> 00:28:42.539
So if you want to sow bountifully in the Faroe Islands, you need to preach also when the weather is bad.

00:28:42.539 --> 00:28:47.539
And we feel that we have reaped bountifully by nice return visits and Bible studies.

00:28:47.539 --> 00:28:54.539
I feel as worth all the effort because we see that people in the territory really appreciate what they are learning.

00:28:54.539 --> 00:29:03.539
All we do in our ministry is motivated by love for Jehovah and the people in the territory, and it won't be changed by bad weather.

00:29:04.539 --> 00:29:08.539
It's an opportunity to show that our worship is wholehearted.

00:29:08.539 --> 00:29:12.539
You don't just go in the ministry when everything is good and the sun is shining.

00:29:12.539 --> 00:29:23.630
I think we have become more enduring and flexible in our ministry.

00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:34.630
We saw the publishers were fully supporting the spirit that the elders showed and sharing the good news despite inclement weather.

00:29:37.039 --> 00:29:50.039
Around the world, many of our brothers face severe opposition because of remaining loyal to Jehovah and maintaining their Christian neutrality.

00:29:50.039 --> 00:30:00.039
Let's travel to Spain and hear how some of our brothers have dealt with these challenges firsthand.

00:30:00.039 --> 00:30:05.670
Spain is a land of castles.

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:13.670
For the mountains of central Spain to the Mediterranean coast, castles dominate the landscape.

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:24.980
But there is one castle, the castle of Santa Catalina, that played a unique part in the history of Jehovah's Witnesses in Spain.

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:33.980
This castle, that guards the entrance to the harbor of Cadet in southern Spain, became a military prison over two centuries ago.

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:39.980
And this fortress tested the faith of around 300 Spanish witnesses.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:49.329
The battle began in the 1960s when Spain was ruled by General Fanco, a military dictator.

00:30:50.329 --> 00:30:57.329
Fanco wanted all Spanish men to serve the Fatherland and this meant military service.

00:30:57.329 --> 00:31:04.329
But in Spain, there were Jehovah's Witnesses whose conscience said no.

00:31:04.329 --> 00:31:14.329
So this castle became a battleground where Fanco's military regime fought to stamp out the Christian conscience of those young witnesses.

00:31:14.329 --> 00:31:20.440
But times have changed in Spain.

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:28.440
The city of Cadet has organized an exhibition to salute the sacrifice made by those valiant witnesses.

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:38.440
Over 40 years after their release, some of those conscientious objectors have returned to Cadet to attend this exhibition.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:54.440
At the inauguration, the mayor described them as citizens who spoke up, who presented arguments against the injustice, arguments based on peace, freedom and above all, their conscience.

00:31:54.440 --> 00:32:05.809
Those who spent years of their lives behind bars have vivid memories of the times when this castle was their prison.

00:32:05.809 --> 00:32:11.809
I think one of the greatest challenges was never knowing if we would be granted our freedom.

00:32:11.809 --> 00:32:17.150
Our first sentence was for three years.

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:25.150
And since we still refused to enlist in the military, we were then sentenced again for another lengthy period.

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:30.150
So it seemed as if we had a life sentence.

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:34.150
We organized daily activities to keep us busy.

00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:40.150
Mornings, we worked at our trades to earn a little money.

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:46.150
Afternoons, we set aside for spiritual activities.

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:51.690
Our preaching was unmainly by writing letters.

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:55.690
And in this way, some of us could even pioneer.

00:32:55.690 --> 00:33:04.690
A few people did reply to our letters and we were thrilled to hear that some of these accepted the truth.

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:07.690
Of course, we also preached to other prisoners.

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:11.690
And a few of them became baptized witnesses.

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:20.690
We also studied the Bible thoroughly, both individually and as a group, which proved vital in building us up spiritually.

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:24.690
At first, we had to study our literature secretly.

00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:32.160
But later, the guards allowed us to have the Bible and other publications.

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:41.160
As our numbers grew, all the witnesses were kept together in the same place, in the same barracks, so we could organize meetings.

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:46.700
We even held assemblies, including the biblical dramas.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:52.549
And we loved singing kindon songs.

00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:56.549
These songs really lifted up our spirits.

00:33:56.549 --> 00:34:04.440
We really felt Jehovah's loving care when the brothers came to visit us.

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:12.300
We even had a special visit from Brother Kran Suta of the governing body.

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:17.300
But there were also other visits that we really looked forward to.

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:23.300
Many of the brothers endured years of separation from their families and fielses.

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.300
This was a real test.

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:31.300
But these faithful sisters wholeheartedly supported their neutral stand.

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:35.300
They were years that molded me spiritually.

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:39.300
I studied the Bible as I had never done before.

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:44.300
I developed the skills as a public speaker and as an overseer.

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:51.300
Above all, it was a time in my life when I learned to rely totally on Jehovah.

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:57.300
Thanks to my fervent prayers, he became my closest friend.

00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:00.300
And he never let me down.

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:02.300
That was priceless.

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:09.300
The firm stand of those witnesses gave a powerful testimony in cadet and throughout Spain.

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:15.300
The rundown military prison that once tested their faith has been restored.

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:20.300
It is now a tourist attraction and a cultural center.

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:28.300
But while the castle has changed, the faith of those valiant witnesses has not.

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:31.300
The castle certainly tested them.

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:34.300
But they fought a fine fight for the faith.

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:39.300
And with Jehovah's help, they won the battle.

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:45.300
Forty years later, their victory is still giving a witness to Jehovah's name.

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:58.260
As we noted earlier, the Apostle Paul said that he was being poured out like a drink offering.

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:10.260
Similarly, these brothers, by remaining neutral, offered up a great sacrifice of praise to Jehovah despite resistance.

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:23.260
And as we learned by loyal endurance, they went on to be gifts in men to those in the congregations and circuits that they later served.

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:38.260
Other examples of gifts in men are those who serve as headquarters representatives visiting branch offices and encouraging members of the Bethel families.

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:47.260
For their Daniel Molchan had the privilege to visit the countries of Haiti and the Dominican Republic.

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:55.260
They have had some exciting spiritual developments in those lands.

00:36:55.260 --> 00:37:07.260
On Sunday, February the 26th, I traveled to Port of Prince for the branch visit that was warmly welcomed by many of the Bethel family of 54 members.

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:13.260
The branch office supervises the preaching work for more than 20,000 publishers.

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:25.260
Although Haiti has faced economic challenges and suffered recent natural disasters, our brothers are positive and focus their attention on helping others to identify our scriptural hope.

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:29.260
The Haitian people should keen interest in the word of God.

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:34.260
Our brothers average more than 42,000 Bible studies each month.

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:40.260
And Haiti enjoyed a memorial attendance of more than 86,000 in 2016.

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:45.260
This is four times more than the number of publishers in the branch territory.

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:48.260
The brothers love to use the videos in the ministry.

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:55.260
This is made possible by the Haiti audio video teams translating the videos into their native language.

00:37:55.260 --> 00:38:02.260
While many in Haiti speak French, the common language of the people in general is Haitian Creole.

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:10.260
Creole is said to be an expressive language that combines French words with the grammar of West African languages.

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:17.260
The number of publishers in Haiti has quadrupled since the start of Creole translation back in 1987.

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:23.260
The complete New World Translation Bible was released in Creole in 2015.

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:27.260
We met with the translation team to commend them for the good work they do.

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:36.260
We reminded them of the many positive results in the field ministry that have taken place since translating the Bible and our literature in Creole.

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:44.260
As an example, Marlene is a vendor of fruits and vegetables who was asked if she would supply some of her produce to Bethel.

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:52.260
Although she was very impressed the first time she arrived at the Bethel property, she said she found the large steel gate to be intimidating.

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:58.260
So she prayed to God to protect her while in the yard at Bethel.

00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:02.260
The brothers dealt kindly with her when she made her deliveries on Monday each week.

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:08.260
One of the brothers from the kitchen told her that maybe someday she too would become one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:11.260
She accepted an invitation to the memorial.

00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:17.260
And despite some personal challenges such as not being able to read well, she began to attend some congregation meetings.

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:23.260
Marlene could see the difference between Jehovah's loving people and those in her church.

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:28.260
A study was started with her and she progressed to the point of baptism in 2009.

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:34.260
Since then, she has worked diligently to teach the truth to her children with good results.

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:43.260
Her oldest son graduated from the School for Kingdom Evangelizers and serves as an elder and temporary special pioneer.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:52.260
Recently, another for sons was appointed ministerial servant and the four other children are unbaptized publishers.

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:57.260
Having our literature in Creole and with the help of her children, she has improved her reading.

00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:05.179
She now benefits from reading the Bible in Creole, the language of her heart.

00:40:05.179 --> 00:40:11.179
Good results are beginning to be seen in the field of American Sign Language, which is now used in Haiti.

00:40:12.179 --> 00:40:18.179
There are now 87 deaf publishers in four ASL congregations and eight groups.

00:40:18.179 --> 00:40:23.179
The congregation here is singing praises to Jehovah.

00:40:23.179 --> 00:40:28.840
Even her little sister is learning to do this.

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:35.500
This brother showed us the effort he puts forth to prepare for a Bible reading.

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:41.500
A special program for Haiti was held on Saturday morning at the open-air assembly hall on the branch property.

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:45.500
A total of 1,405 were in attendance.

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:52.500
We were very encouraged to see the group of our brothers who benefited from the program in American Sign Language.

00:40:52.500 --> 00:41:03.500
The program was recorded and presented at Kingdom Halls throughout the country later that same day and also on Sunday to a combined audience of 34,812.

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:15.389
We felt a little sad to leave the brothers on Sunday morning for a drive of about six hours or so to the Dominican Republic where the second branch visit.

00:41:15.389 --> 00:41:21.389
In route, we traveled through some semi-airid areas to the border between the two countries.

00:41:21.389 --> 00:41:29.389
The terrain varied greatly as we drove through small mountains, rich agricultural regions, and along the Caribbean Sea.

00:41:29.389 --> 00:41:37.389
We took the opportunity to witness to some individuals at the border and at various checkpoints leaving literature along the way.

00:41:37.389 --> 00:41:46.769
Upon entering the city of Santo Domingo, we quickly identified the large JW.org sign at the branch office.

00:41:46.769 --> 00:41:51.769
We were enthusiastically greeted by many of the 73 Bethel family members.

00:41:51.769 --> 00:42:01.179
Although the preaching work is done primarily in Spanish, our brothers are expanding their ministry to reach the language of the hearts of many people

00:42:01.179 --> 00:42:15.179
and cultures. There are now five Haitian Creole circuits in the branch territory, 26 American Sign Language congregations, and other congregations or groups in Russian, Chinese, Italian, and French.

00:42:15.179 --> 00:42:22.179
We joined a group of brothers and sisters in the field ministry in the Chinatown District of Santo Domingo.

00:42:22.179 --> 00:42:31.179
Our group gave a witness to both Spanish and Chinese speaking people on the streets, most of whom respectfully listened to our message.

00:42:31.179 --> 00:42:38.179
A Bethel brother, Evan, told us of the challenge he faced when learning the truth.

00:42:38.179 --> 00:42:43.179
I was finishing medical school while serving in the Dominican Army.

00:42:43.179 --> 00:42:51.179
By then, I had been serving for six years. At my aunt's home, I found the Revelation book.

00:42:51.179 --> 00:42:58.179
It made such an impact on me that I stole it and read it all on my own.

00:42:58.179 --> 00:43:08.179
There's a vision in Chapter 6 of Revelation, where the sixth seals open and the sky's darken and the army commanders hide in caves.

00:43:08.179 --> 00:43:19.179
That vision impressed me so much that I decided to serve Jehovah. That meant that I would have to leave the army because witnesses are neutral.

00:43:19.179 --> 00:43:26.179
I quickly decided to talk to my immediate commander to ask him to please discharge me from the army.

00:43:26.179 --> 00:43:35.179
However, he rejected my request and said, no, you have served in the army for six years. You have to stay in the army.

00:43:35.179 --> 00:43:44.179
I was not concerned because I could still appeal to the colonel and charge of personnel. However, my request for resignation was rejected again.

00:43:44.179 --> 00:43:52.179
I left and went to the hallway. I prayed to Jehovah. I want to serve you. What should I do? Help me find a way out of this.

00:43:52.179 --> 00:44:02.179
When I opened my eyes, another army officer approached and greeted me using my name. I still don't know who he is. He asked me, what do you need?

00:44:02.179 --> 00:44:11.179
I explained that I wanted to resign in order to become a Jehovah's Witness. He said, don't worry, give me your papers. I'm the colonel's assistant.

00:44:11.179 --> 00:44:20.179
Within 20 minutes, my discharge papers were ready and approved. In a short period of time, I became a publisher and I got baptized as one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:44:20.179 --> 00:44:26.179
At this time, I've been serving happily and Bethel for over 11 years with my wife, Hyell.

00:44:26.179 --> 00:44:39.920
Without a doubt, Jehovah helps those who put their complete trust in him. The branches blessed to have as part of their Bethel family, some who had been long-time missionaries.

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:48.920
I enjoyed a very pleasant visit with five of the senior members of this group, three of whom are 98 years of age.

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:57.920
Brother William Dingman is the first class of Gilead. His wife Estelle attended the 12th class. Thelma Crites is also the 12th class.

00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:04.920
Barbara Parker is the 42nd class and Helen Ferrari attended the 2nd class of Gilead.

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:19.920
To illustrate the length of their full-time service is the fact that Sister Ferrari is among those who stood up to identify themselves as part of the great multitude at the 1935 Convention in Washington, D.C.

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:29.920
The average age of this group is 94. Even more impressive is that their average years of full-time service is 73.

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:37.920
These faithful ones set a fine example continuing to be active in the ministry, taking into account their ages and health limitations.

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:43.920
Such loyal servants of Jehovah are considered spiritual treasures wherever they may serve.

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:57.920
I still have one study so far, although my sight doesn't allow me to do too much, but I try. My legs aren't so good for walking, so they will me around.

00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:08.920
In all of my life, I would consider the life that I have spent as a missionary and hearing Dominican Republic as well.

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:25.920
It's a wonderful life. I couldn't have chosen a better companion and also a better life than to be preaching the message of the good news of the kingdom.

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:33.920
The Dominican Republic Bethel family considers it a privilege to have a share in providing care for such faithful ones.

00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:41.920
On Sunday, March 12, a special program was held at the Open Air Assembly Hall adjacent to the branch office.

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:47.920
A total of 3,050 benefited from the Spiritual Program in Christian Association.

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:57.920
The visits to the Dominican Republic and Haiti branches proved to be an encouragement and a spiritual blessing to all who participated in them.

00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:08.920
We thank Brother Mo Chan for that report and for sharing those motivating experiences of long-time servants of Jehovah.

00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:28.300
Another example of this is Richard and Peggy Kelsey. How has he, with the support of his dear wife, proved to be one of the gifts and men throughout his decades of full-time service?

00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:41.760
I was born in a little town called Adair, Iowa, actually out on the farm. That was in 1930.

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:52.760
I was born in 1931, also in a small town in Iowa. My father wanted to be a farmer, so we moved to a farm and I grew up on a farm.

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:58.760
And then the watchtower study of a little group and a little congregation was in our home.

00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:07.760
And happily, when Peggy's father came to the truth, the family, they came to our place to watchtower study.

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:14.760
I was, I guess, at that time eight or nine and Peggy one year younger.

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:19.760
But the thing was, they moved away just about after one year.

00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:26.760
Well, I started pioneering in September 1948.

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:33.760
Gilead is that what I want. I didn't apply for Bethel because I like the field service.

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:40.760
And I thought South America, Africa, countries that still, where there was so much to do, that's what I wanted.

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:48.760
I was called to Gilead in 1951 in February.

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:57.099
The assignment after attending Gilead was a great surprise.

00:48:57.099 --> 00:49:08.099
Brother Schroeder, one of the instructors, he said, you will have a very wonderful opportunity being assigned to the German Bethel.

00:49:08.099 --> 00:49:14.099
There are brothers there who have been in concentration camps for up to nine years.

00:49:14.099 --> 00:49:18.099
And you can learn very much from these brothers.

00:49:18.099 --> 00:49:26.900
And that was very true in 1953 at the convention in New York.

00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:34.900
I saw a beautiful young sister standing in the cafeteria line next to my cafeteria line.

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:37.900
And I looked twice and it was Peggy.

00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:46.900
So we were together for the rest of the convention and decided we would correspond and think about serving together.

00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:49.900
In 1955, we married then.

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:55.400
I had received the assignment circuit work.

00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:58.400
We were assigned to Northern Germany.

00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:01.400
When we began circuit work, I was 24.

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:15.400
I felt completely inadequate because I'd been serving in Bethel and had no training that would qualify me to serve as the circuit overseer.

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:18.400
That was my feeling.

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:25.400
The first place the sisters with me, they always got nervous not being able to speak correctly.

00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:30.400
I would take over the conversation and I stood there and didn't understand anything.

00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:33.400
But with time you pick it up.

00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:38.400
After two years I could understand everything in the theocratic language.

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:41.400
But in the kitchen I was still lost.

00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:47.400
It was nine years for circuit and the conclusion district work.

00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:52.400
And then we were called back into Bethel.

00:50:53.400 --> 00:51:03.400
The biggest shock for me was when Brother Nora asked me if I would be branch overseer.

00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:08.400
And that was at the convention 1969 in Nuremberg.

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:17.400
Despite the different arguments that I presented and I got a letter later saying I'd have that assignment.

00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:23.400
For about 40 years we had the wonderful privilege of doing zone work.

00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:28.400
Of course it's now stated being representative headquarters.

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:34.400
So it was wonderful to visit somewhat over 90 different countries.

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:38.400
It became acquainted with Jehovah's lovely family.

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:52.400
And the worldwide brotherhood unity and seeing how the brothers everywhere are devoted to Jehovah and want to serve him faithfully under sometimes very difficult conditions.

00:51:52.400 --> 00:52:04.400
I would say sometimes we benefited more from the visit than the brothers we were visiting because it was so faith strengthening.

00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:24.400
When we got this privilege of traveling to many branches and zone work we were able to engage in the field ministry in numerous countries which I never would have had of course if I would have just gone into missionary service.

00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:34.400
I said to myself except every assignment Jehovah gives you and you'll find that you have the greatest blessings possible.

00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:42.400
Since 1st of January 1952 I've been able to keep full time services my career.

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:46.400
And it's something I certainly wouldn't have changed for anything else.

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:53.400
We have often spoken where would we be today if we hadn't taken up full time service.

00:52:53.400 --> 00:53:00.400
Certainly we would not have enjoyed so many things as we have in our lifetime.

00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:07.400
There are so many young talented brothers and sisters that are working and helping.

00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:18.760
We encourage them to make full time service in Jehovah's organization their goal in life.

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:28.760
Are you one of those young talented brothers or sisters whom Brother Kelsey mentioned could make full time service a goal?

00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:34.760
If so, keep it in your prayers.

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:47.760
Yes, as we look back at our program and the examples of various gifts in men, their wives and numerous others doing all they can for Jehovah,

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:55.760
what is it that motivates them to live such self-sacrificing lives?

00:53:55.760 --> 00:54:07.760
Love and that's the theme of this month's music video entitled Brotherly Love.

00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:32.409
Because wherever you go Jehovah's people are there and you'll feel low.

00:54:32.409 --> 00:54:37.409
You'll feel low for Brotherly Love.

00:54:37.409 --> 00:55:02.599
So feel the love, this is all over the nation.

00:55:02.599 --> 00:57:50.960
What a beautiful song and a good reminder that one way we can show our love to Jehovah and Jesus

00:57:50.960 --> 00:58:01.960
is by showing love, respect and appreciation for the gifts and men they have generously given us.

00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:08.960
Now, before we end the program, we have a special treat.

00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:17.960
Our postcard this month comes from right here at our JW Broadcasting Studio.

00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:24.960
Yes, you get a sneak peek behind the scenes of how our broadcast is produced.

00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:31.960
First, a group of brothers and sisters set aside their regular Bethelwork for parts of three days.

00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:38.960
Early on the first day, the director reviews the shot list with crew members.

00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:45.960
The shot list is a series of photographs showing how the cameras will record each scene.

00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:52.960
In the control room, media is prepared for display on the studio's video screen.

00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:57.960
The microphones and cameras are all properly adjusted.

00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:06.960
Then the crew rehearses the entire program several times while a stand-in substitutes for the program host.

00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:13.960
This allows the real host to concentrate on his other work during these technical rehearsals.

00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:24.960
On the third day, the actual host reports to the studio's makeup room where wardrobe makes sure that he looks his best.

00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:29.960
Before recording begins, the crew assembles for a brief meeting.

00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:37.960
The host often gives a few brief comments and the floor director gives any final instruction to the crew.

00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:41.960
After a prayer, everyone takes their positions.

00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:48.960
Within a few hours, the entire recording for that month's program is completed.

00:59:48.960 --> 01:00:00.960
Yes, our hard-working brothers and sisters at work in the studio happily send you their warm love and greetings.

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:09.960
This is JW Broadcasting from the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses.
