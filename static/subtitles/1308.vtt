00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:09.419
Throughout history, Jehovah has provided for the spiritual needs of his people.

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:20.420
Jehovah has also given his people what's needed to carry out any work he has assigned them to do.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:27.420
In modern times, Jehovah has used printed literature to provide spiritual food.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.420
But in recent years, digital media has become readily available.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:41.420
Have you wondered what impact the increased use of electronic publications

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:49.420
and the emphasis on using the new teaching toolbox has had on the amount of literature being printed?

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.420
How has the Brotherhood benefited from these adjustments?

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:07.420
As you watch the following video, it will become obvious that a significant amount of money is being saved each year.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:19.420
This has allowed the organization to reallocate those funds to other critically needed areas, such as disaster relief,

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:34.579
and to help compensate for unavoidable rising operational costs at facilities around the world.

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:41.579
As prophesied in the book of Isaiah, Jehovah's people enjoy a great variety of spiritual food in this time of the end.

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:48.579
JW Broadcasting, JW.org, Bible releases in one language after another.

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:58.579
Jehovah generously provides all of the resources needed in order to prepare and serve this rich banquet to our worldwide Brotherhood.

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:06.579
And while all of the silver and gold belonged to Jehovah, he has not given his people unlimited resources.

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:14.580
Rather, he dignifies his people with the privilege of managing the resources that he has provided.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:25.580
The governing body is careful to constantly make sure of the more important things, as they direct the use of these resources in areas that will do the most good.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.580
How have they made sure of the more important things in providing printed publications throughout the years?

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.580
Since the 1870s, printed publications have played an important role in dispensing spiritual food.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:48.580
Through the years, much of the organization's resources have been allocated for the machinery, buildings, and support of the brothers that have cared for printing.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.580
During the 20th century, printers sprang up in one country after another.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:04.580
By the 1970s, there were 37 printing branches, with 64 large printing presses, and by the 90s, 28 binary lines.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.580
Around this time, a series of significant technological improvements were made in the printing and binding industry.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.580
Taking advantage of these technologies, the organization increased their printing and binding capacity.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.580
While at the same time reduced the number of printing branches in personnel.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:33.580
For example, starting in 2003, the worldwide printing and binary capacity was upgraded, with the purchase of seven new, high-speed, man-rolling web presses.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.580
And the installation of a new deluxe cover bindery line.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:44.580
As a result, in less than four years, the number of printer personnel had been reduced by 25%.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:51.580
Of course, over time, our needs change, both for the brotherhood and for the field.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:59.580
Additionally, new developments promptly organization to re-evaluate how resources can best be used.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:08.580
For example, significant adjustments in the late 80s and early 90s better equipped the organization to support translation into new languages.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:14.580
Additionally, in 2005, a higher priority was given to Bible translation.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:25.579
This would allow more language groups to benefit from the new world translation, especially where it had become difficult to obtain an acceptable Bible translation at a reasonable cost.

00:04:25.579 --> 00:04:29.579
More recently, there has been a change in how people consume information.

00:04:29.579 --> 00:04:35.579
As a result, greater emphasis has been placed on digital media, including videos.

00:04:35.579 --> 00:04:42.579
All the while, demand for printed literature continued to grow, especially for the field ministry.

00:04:42.579 --> 00:04:50.579
In recent years, 85% of our global printing work was dedicated to publications used in the field ministry.

00:04:51.579 --> 00:05:01.579
So, a growing need in translation, a growing need for digital publications, and production of publications for the field continued to increase.

00:05:01.579 --> 00:05:07.579
How has the governing body made sure of the more important things in view of these developments?

00:05:07.579 --> 00:05:11.579
Consider a few recent decisions and their impact.

00:05:11.579 --> 00:05:20.579
In 2008, the public edition of the Watchtower was introduced, and we began to offer only one issue in the field ministry each month.

00:05:20.579 --> 00:05:30.579
In 2013, the awake and the public edition of the Watchtower were reduced from 32 to 16 pages.

00:05:30.579 --> 00:05:33.579
This allowed for two magazines to be printed at once.

00:05:33.579 --> 00:05:44.579
Then, in 2016, and again in 2018, decisions were made to reduce the number of issues of the awake in the public edition of the Watchtower.

00:05:44.579 --> 00:05:49.579
These decisions allowed for more languages to begin translating the magazines.

00:05:49.579 --> 00:05:56.579
They also reduced our magazine printing workload by 63% over the past 10 years.

00:05:56.579 --> 00:06:02.579
Other recent adjustments include no longer distributing hard copy releases at conventions.

00:06:02.579 --> 00:06:11.579
These simplified teaching toolbox, eliminating specific monthly literature offers, and the increased emphasis on using the Bible.

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:19.579
All of these decisions have reduced the printing of books used in the ministry by 25% over the past three years.

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:23.579
What have been the results of the reduction in printing needs?

00:06:23.579 --> 00:06:28.579
For one, less space or buildings are needed for our global printing work.

00:06:29.579 --> 00:06:39.579
Also, instead of reinvesting in new printing equipment, funds were able to be reallocated to other areas. Consider a few examples.

00:06:39.579 --> 00:06:54.579
In 2009, rather than invest in new presses for the Italy and Spain branches, it was determined that their work could now be absorbed by the higher capacity presses recently installed in Britain and Central Europe.

00:06:54.579 --> 00:07:01.579
In 2016, consideration needed to be given to the aging press in Australasia.

00:07:01.579 --> 00:07:08.579
It was determined that the Japan branch could care for their needs, avoiding further investment.

00:07:08.579 --> 00:07:15.579
The original plans for the new branch in Chelmsford, Britain included a new, large, printery.

00:07:15.579 --> 00:07:23.579
However, the reduction in printing allowed for Britain's work to be absorbed by Central Europe and other printeries in 2018.

00:07:23.579 --> 00:07:28.579
This has resulted in saving millions of dollars in new construction costs.

00:07:28.579 --> 00:07:36.579
Similar savings were also experienced by consolidating the printing of Argentina, India, and the Philippines to other branches.

00:07:36.579 --> 00:07:45.579
Currently, there are six book binding branches and three additional branches with web presses that print magazines, brochures, and tracks.

00:07:46.579 --> 00:07:51.579
Of course, as printing was consolidated, staffing levels were also reduced.

00:07:51.579 --> 00:07:57.579
Today, a total of 1,100 serve as full-time printery workers worldwide.

00:07:57.579 --> 00:08:03.579
This represents a further reduction of 350 full-time workers over the past decade.

00:08:03.579 --> 00:08:07.579
What have been some of the notable benefits of these adjustments?

00:08:07.579 --> 00:08:13.579
For one thing, the organization is now free to do more for the brothers in other areas.

00:08:13.579 --> 00:08:16.579
Consider a few examples.

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:23.579
Additional resources are now available to help support the growing number of translation teams worldwide.

00:08:23.579 --> 00:08:36.580
As of September 2018, the number of languages in which we have produced literature has increased from 488 in 2010 to over 900 today.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:41.580
In 2012, before the introduction of 16-page magazines,

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:47.580
the study edition of the Watch Tower was translated into 158 languages.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:55.580
Now, only six years later, the language count has more than doubled to 335 languages.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:01.580
Especially noteworthy is the increase in the number of languages that now have the New World Translation.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:10.580
For the first 40 years after its initial release, the New World Translation was made available in whole or in part in 38 languages.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:18.580
However, in just the last 18 years, this number has more than quadrupled to 177 languages.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:24.580
Some of these language groups did not have a reliable secular translation in their language.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:33.580
Now, even in languages where there are only a few hundred publishers, our brothers are delighted to enjoy the best translation of Jehovah's Word in their mother tongue.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:41.580
More resources can now be used to develop content on JW.org in nearly 1,000 languages.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:49.580
People who have never read our publications before are now receiving a witness thanks to the extraordinary reach of JW.org,

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.580
and the impact of the website on the Brotherhood has been amazing.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:10:01.580
Think, for example, of how the online study Bible has deepened our knowledge of God's Word, enriching our faith,

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:09.580
and how JW broadcasting has unified our Brotherhood just when we needed the most in this time of the end.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.580
This is so important.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:16.580
Certainly, the beneficial impact of these recent decisions is readily evident.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:23.580
Jehovah is blessing his people with a wide variety of spiritual food like never before in history.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:29.580
This is a result of the Faithland Discrete Slave making sure of the more important things.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:36.580
What a thrill to work along with Jehovah's organization and witness his divine blessing upon it.
