00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.070
As a father, I never expected this to happen to my family.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:19.879
One day, my son came home from work and told me that he had committed his sin.

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:23.879
I asked him if it was serious and he said that it was.

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:27.879
When my son confessed, I felt incredibly sad.

00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:33.880
This deep pain, because I really wasn't expecting this from him.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.880
I was very aware that the greatest love we should have should be for Jehovah.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.880
And that gave me the strength to encourage him to seek spiritual assistance.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:55.340
I said that the wise thing for him to do would be to seek Jehovah's help through the elders, to talk to them about it.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.340
Regardless of what would happen to my privileges.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.340
I knew there would be other consequences.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.340
I knew that no matter what, this was going to hurt my family.

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:12.959
Later, I regained my privileges.

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:22.209
As a father, I'm extremely happy to see my son serving Jehovah wholeheartedly alongside his wife, who's a pioneer.

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:28.209
What matters most for us, as humans, is to make Jehovah's heart rejoice.

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:34.209
And we've been richly blessed, and that means that all we went through was worthy effort.

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:42.209
We're happy. We're glad to be serving Jehovah, and he has blessed us with wonderful privileges of service.

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:49.209
As elders, we need to be courageous to stand up to difficult situations, knowing what is right.

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:53.209
We know that Jehovah is aware, and that he sees everything.

00:01:53.209 --> 00:02:00.209
We need to protect Jehovah's name, which is so important because of Satan's challenge against it.
