WEBVTT

00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:08.859
Jehovah's people are generous and want to give.

00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:13.859
Doing so with the Spirit mentioned at 2 Corinthians 9-7,

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:17.859
let each one do just as he has resolved in his heart,

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:23.859
not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.859
One of many ways we can display this generous spirit

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.859
is through our financial donations.

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.859
We are familiar with placing a contribution in the boxes labeled

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:39.859
contributions for the worldwide work at our local Kingdom Hall.

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:45.859
Recently, the organization has made some changes to allow for donating online.

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:49.859
Some have had questions on how to use these new tools.

00:00:49.859 --> 00:01:00.490
The donation information page on JW.org can be accessed via the JW Library app or on the website.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:06.489
By selecting the country where you live, you can see the donation methods available to you.

00:01:06.489 --> 00:01:11.489
Different types of donation methods are available in different countries.

00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:15.489
How have some been able to put this tool to use?

00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:22.489
In many countries, we can give using a credit or some debit cards via JW.org.

00:01:22.489 --> 00:01:29.799
Anyone can make donations online by creating an account if they don't already have one.

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.799
This makes donating simpler both for you and for the organization.

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:41.799
Just as many of us already follow the scriptural pattern at 1st Corinthians 16-2,

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.799
set something aside every week according to our own means,

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.799
we can do the same with these online tools.

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.799
You can set up recurring donations so that this is done automatically every month.

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.799
My biggest challenge in making donations was remembering to put the donation in the box,

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.799
but one day I was on the JW website and saw that there was a way to make online donations.

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:14.800
And what was even better was that I could program an automatic donation of the same amount every month.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.800
So every month I receive a receipt that my donation has gone through.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.800
And that makes me very happy because I can help Jehovah every month.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.699
And this way, it's easy.

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:35.699
Or perhaps we'd rather have our donation transferred electronically right from our bank account.

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:43.699
In some countries, a bank account is provided that will allow you to transfer funds directly to the branch office.

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:50.699
Simply use the tools provided by your bank to set up a direct donation to this account.

00:02:51.699 --> 00:03:04.879
We can easily go to the JW.org website and use the donations page to donate online directly from our account,

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:14.509
just as we would make any other money transfers.

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:17.509
Some prefer to contribute by check or money order.

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:25.889
The details on where to mail this type of donation can also be found on JW.org.

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:31.889
Well, each month when I watch JW broadcasting and see all the things that are going around over the earth,

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:37.889
I would like to show them my appreciation for this hard work that the brothers do.

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:45.889
And the way I can do that since I'm no longer able to do much physically is by writing them a check and this letter of appreciation.

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:54.050
Other methods of donating might involve charitable planning.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:02.050
We could arrange to give assets at our death through a will, trust, life insurance policy or retirement plan.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:14.050
During our life or at our death, we could also donate certificates of deposit, stocks and bonds, as well as saleable real estate.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:21.050
We are living in the days when unexpected events take place just as the Bible foretold.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:30.050
So we decided to make charitable plans so that our material assets can be used to advance JW's work.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.050
Tutto, every worthwhile thing we have also comes from JW.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.050
I feel privileged to return to JW, what I originally received from him.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:48.050
And I think this deep joy in my heart is the very blessing that I receive from JW.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:57.050
There are many forms of giving. Go to the donation information page to see what options are available in your country.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:03.050
However, some types of donations typically require planning or additional information.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.050
If you have any questions, you can check with your local branch office.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:16.050
Feel free to submit a request for more information and your local branch office will respond by email within a few days.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.050
Or you can call the branch directly using the phone number provided.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:29.050
But what if we wish to continue giving in the ways we have been or we don't understand how to use these new tools?

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.050
New tools can be hard to understand at first.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:41.050
But asking for the help of a trusted brother or sister in the congregation can help us take advantage of these tools.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.050
Exodus 35, 5, and 21 says,

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.050
Take up a contribution for Jehovah from among yourselves.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.050
Let everyone with a willing heart bring a contribution for Jehovah.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.050
Gold, silver, copper.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.050
Then everyone who's heart impelled him and everyone who's spirit incited him,

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.050
came and brought their contribution for Jehovah.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:11.050
Just as the Israelites knew what options they had in giving to Jehovah,

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:18.050
we want to know the different ways that we can make donations and the tools we can use to do so.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:23.050
Please take time to review these options on the donation information page

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.050
and use the methods and tools that are best for you.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.050
No matter how we choose to donate,

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.050
we can be confident that just as in the days of Moses,

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.050
the donations we make support pure worship.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.050
And whether we are giving of our time,

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.050
our energy, or our resources,

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:48.050
we know that Jehovah loves a cheerful giver.
