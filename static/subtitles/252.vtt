00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.150
A friend is someone that you can really trust, you can trust that they won't hurt you

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.750
and also that they'll help you out if they can.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.989
We get together and we'll say things at exactly the same time and exactly the same tone

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:19.989
of voice.

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:24.300
It's kind of scary sometimes.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.710
A friend to me is someone who knows you inside and out.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.909
The advantage of having good friends with spiritual mind is you both are working towards

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:56.119
the same purpose.

00:00:56.119 --> 00:01:01.719
Coming up on young people ask, roadblocks to friendship.

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:06.120
They have their own little groups and if you're not in that group, then you're not invited

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.120
either.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.959
Young people talk about friendship with God.

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:14.480
I definitely think that having a friendship with God is a hard concept to understand.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.159
The dangers of making the wrong kind of friends.

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.200
I got involved in that association basically at school and then a modern day trauma.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.120
How are your parents telling me I had a flat tire or something?

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.120
Oh yeah.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:34.060
You know, you're different from the other girls, aren't you?

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:46.250
All this coming up on young people ask, how can I make real friends?

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.810
There exists a friend sticking closer than a brother.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:58.260
The Bible said that almost 3,000 years ago and it's still true today.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.569
Everybody needs friends.

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:09.139
The problem is making friends is not always easy.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:15.659
Sometimes young people feel that they just don't fit in, even with their Christian brothers.

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:36.150
They feel like they're always on the outside looking in.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.099
The road to friendship is not always an easy ride.

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:46.539
Young people in four different countries told us to some of the roadblocks they've encountered.

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:52.960
The first roadblock feeling left out.

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:57.960
They have their own little proofs and if you're not in that group, then you're not invited either.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.400
If you're not a certain age, you don't belong.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.800
It's like an amusement park.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.599
If you're not a certain height, you can't get on the ride.

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:10.000
That's what a lot of young people do to you.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.599
Being ignored can affect us a lot.

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:18.520
You can get so sad that you just don't want to open up to anyone.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.800
For me, when I came from Bolivia, I got here and I had no friends.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.599
I felt so strange.

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.360
Everybody's speaking a different language.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.360
Everybody looked different than me.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:37.039
Being shy at times, it could seem lonely because they're either too scared or too shy to

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:46.180
associate with them so you'd rather stay home and just do your own thing.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:53.439
Whether you're young, new in town or just shy, it hurts to feel left out.

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:56.280
There is a solution to these problems.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.840
Following the advice of God's word, the Bible.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.240
It has the best advice on friendship ever written.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:09.520
For example, Philippians 2.4 gives us one of the keys to making friends,

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.159
taking a personal interest to others.

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:20.079
If you show interest to other people, they will do the same for you.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.279
If we want to have friends, we first have to be friends ourselves.

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:26.120
You have to take the initiative.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.120
My mom's always pushing me.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.120
Okay.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.240
I want you to talk to a certain number of people at this meeting.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.480
I'm trying to widen out.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.720
A good place to widen out is at the Kingdom Hall.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.720
Why not take the initiative and try to meet people?

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.720
Hey, how you doing?

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.720
Well, it's good to see you.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.720
How's it going?

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.720
Good to see you again.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.439
Hey, it's a lot of tools you lack here.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.079
I like to arrive at meetings 20 minutes before they begin.

00:04:56.079 --> 00:05:00.639
In that way, I have the opportunity to speak with more people.

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:04.279
Probably the best way to meet people would be by going out into service.

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:08.040
They put you with a person that you might not actually talk to, usually in the Kingdom Hall.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.360
And then you're like, oh man, who would this person?

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.000
And I wanted to go with this sister or something like that.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.879
Eventually, you start talking, and that's how you meet the person.

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:20.050
You get to another better.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.930
Feeling left out is just one roadblock to friendship.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:30.209
For some young people, another roadblock may be personality.

00:05:30.209 --> 00:05:34.810
I think somebody who really is out to impress everybody really turns people off

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.769
because they constantly talk about themselves and don't really listen to what everybody else

00:05:39.769 --> 00:05:40.769
has to say.

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:42.769
The whole conversation is on that person.

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:45.730
You don't like to be what a person has to consider it because all the time you're just

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:46.730
talking about themselves.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.930
I get the impression that once people

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.449
get to know me, they no longer want to be my friends.

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:56.610
Because I'm very impulsive.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.490
Well, I yell a lot.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.250
Sometimes we need to make changes in our personality.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.250
As the Bible says, we must continue to be readjusted.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:15.329
God can help us to make these changes.

00:06:15.329 --> 00:06:19.610
I pray to Jehovah for self-control, and that I become less impulsive.

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:29.129
Each time I pray to Jehovah, I ask him to help me, and I feel things are getting better.

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:33.209
If you feel insecure and you want people to like you, one thing to be careful of is not

00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:39.610
to become too overbearing or neurotic or nervous and try to really force it.

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.529
The best way to make yourself like a ball is to be yourself.

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:44.730
Don't try to be someone that you're not because if you try to put on this front or

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.850
a different person, people are going to see through that.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:53.970
Another way to improve our personality is to learn to communicate.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:07:00.930
Ecclesiastes37 says, there's a time to keep quiet, and a time to speak.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:06.170
I've been told I talk a lot, but now I'm going to be quiet for the rest of the day.

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:07.490
There's a time for everything.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:08.490
There's a time for everything.

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.329
That's something I had to learn.

00:07:10.329 --> 00:07:14.769
I think knowing how to listen is one of the most important things, right?

00:07:14.769 --> 00:07:18.290
Because in a friendship, there's communication and there's dialogue.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:23.970
It shows your interest that in others, when you don't interrupt a person's talk.

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:28.610
A true friend knows how to listen to other people's problems.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.209
When your friend starts telling you his feelings,

00:07:31.209 --> 00:07:34.649
but you ignore him and go on to something else that you want to talk about,

00:07:34.649 --> 00:07:36.689
well, that wouldn't be very nice.

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:42.209
And he's going to say, what kind of friend is that?

00:07:42.209 --> 00:07:46.209
Working on our personality can help us to win friends.

00:07:46.209 --> 00:07:55.170
Even so, we can hit another roadblock when friendships seem to become too close.

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:58.689
To have a friend that I also like to have my space,

00:07:58.689 --> 00:08:05.459
because I've had that experience when they get so close to you that they just don't want to let go.

00:08:05.459 --> 00:08:10.939
At 2nd Corinthians 613, the Bible tells us to widen out.

00:08:10.939 --> 00:08:14.300
Don't let your one friend be your answer to happiness.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.459
If they're just relying on you, then they have the problem of not widening out,

00:08:18.459 --> 00:08:22.740
and they're missing out on so much more of what's in the congregation than just you.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:29.660
Why didn't he now open up opportunities for friendship that you may have overlooked?

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.860
A bunch of the guys will always be together.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.779
And then we noticed this other guy always been alone.

00:08:34.779 --> 00:08:38.419
At the beginning, we used to think he was like, ah, this guy's not worth it, he's not good.

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:42.980
For our surprise, the guy was really nice. He was really, really, really funny.

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.740
There's never been a lot of young people in our congregation,

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:49.860
but we looked around to see who we could get along with, even if we weren't the same age.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:53.620
We also looked in other congregations, and now we have a nice group.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:58.370
Yes, widen out.

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:01.970
Get to know the brothers and sisters in your congregation.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:12.429
Learn to enjoy variety of people, people of different ages and backgrounds.

00:09:12.429 --> 00:09:15.149
So take an interest in others.

00:09:15.149 --> 00:09:24.580
Work on personality flaws, widen out.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:29.580
When you follow vital principles, you'll find that others enjoy being around you,

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:37.850
and making friends becomes easier.

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:42.769
There is one friendship, however, that is more important than any other.

00:09:42.769 --> 00:09:59.570
But when I was younger, I didn't really think of Jehovah that much as a person.

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:04.330
Well, I definitely think that having a friendship with God is a hard concept to understand.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.690
I like the scripture that says, taste and see that Jehovah is good,

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:11.970
because if you want to get to know Jehovah as a friend and develop a relationship with him,

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:16.610
you do have to put forth effort, and you have to take the first step you could say.

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:20.769
You have to see Jehovah as a person, and that he's real.

00:10:20.769 --> 00:10:24.289
And that when you pray, you know he's hearing you.

00:10:24.289 --> 00:10:28.409
When I'm all alone, I take advantage of the opportunity to talk to him.

00:10:28.409 --> 00:10:31.049
I talk to him all the time.

00:10:31.049 --> 00:10:37.289
There is no greater feeling than having Jehovah as your friend, and it's worth the effort.

00:10:37.289 --> 00:10:43.529
Friends in your life come and go, but the only person who will never truly leave you is Jehovah.

00:10:43.529 --> 00:10:46.690
He can be your friend forever if you want him to be.

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:49.610
Our family went through some hard times, having a single mom.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:52.690
We didn't know our next meal was coming from, we would be able to pay the rent,

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:57.370
and I think the biggest thing I learned in my life is to throw that anxiety upon Jehovah,

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:02.009
and he'll take care of you in every single time without fail, and he's come through for us.

00:11:02.009 --> 00:11:03.850
My parents weren't in the truth.

00:11:03.889 --> 00:11:06.370
The only thing I had was Jehovah.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:10.570
So I had developed a real relationship with him.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:16.490
When I think of a friend, I think of somebody you desire to tell your feelings to,

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:20.490
where you can always tell Jehovah anything.

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:27.289
Through the good times and the bad, one way or another, I've seen that he's always helped me to continue.

00:11:27.289 --> 00:11:33.129
Whenever I have a problem, whenever I'm down, I always know that I can go to him

00:11:33.129 --> 00:11:36.090
anytime that I want to for anything.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:41.529
I think you kind of go from where it's just saying his name to the microphone.

00:11:41.529 --> 00:11:46.129
That's a wonderful answer to a point where he's real to you, and he's there,

00:11:46.129 --> 00:11:50.169
and he's in your everyday life, and you want him there more than anything,

00:11:50.169 --> 00:12:01.720
because he's your friend, and you know that he's the best friend that you could ever have.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:10.350
When you make Jehovah your best friend, you'll be drawn to others who do likewise.

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:20.419
In the Christian congregation, you can enjoy friendships with people of different ages and backgrounds,

00:12:20.419 --> 00:12:37.149
friendships that can influence you in a positive way.

00:12:37.149 --> 00:12:42.149
What helped me more than anything else was the help from the other young people in the congregation.

00:12:42.149 --> 00:12:49.149
They always tried to include me, not only in recreation, but also in spiritual activities.

00:12:49.149 --> 00:12:53.230
I think that having friends that are older than ourselves is a good thing,

00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:58.710
because we can talk to them about our problems, then as friends, they'll help us.

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:00.509
I like to play ball.

00:13:00.509 --> 00:13:04.190
At first, I didn't want to hang out with them because I had a little bit of nail, quiet, or they, you know,

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:06.669
they're too old. They can't play.

00:13:06.669 --> 00:13:09.549
So, when they were like, I had to go after them eating and play basketball.

00:13:09.549 --> 00:13:10.710
I suppose I just got to play.

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:11.710
We beat you.

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:13.230
We beat you.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:15.230
We beat you.

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:19.509
My main adult friends are my parents.

00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:22.190
I think they're the ones who can give you the best advice.

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:25.190
Since they love you more than anyone else.

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:27.830
Well, I talk to my mom and dad, and they'd listen.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:33.029
And I know that sounds very story bookish, like it's out of some story fairy tale,

00:13:33.029 --> 00:13:40.129
but it's what happened to me.

00:13:40.129 --> 00:13:49.740
Whether they're young or old, the best kind of friends are people who are friends of God.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:59.460
Among true Christians, you can find friends who will not hurt you,

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:04.460
but who will help you.

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:16.179
You can have friends who won't tear you down, but who will build you up.

00:14:16.179 --> 00:14:20.419
You can have friends you can trust, who are loyal.

00:14:20.419 --> 00:14:43.659
If you are a friend of God, you will never be without real friends.

00:14:43.659 --> 00:14:52.659
Not everyone is satisfied with who's some Christian association.

00:14:52.659 --> 00:14:56.740
Some are envious of young people who seem to be more exciting,

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.860
who seem to be having a good time.

00:14:59.659 --> 00:15:06.860
When you're young, you need to feel accepted and to belong to a group.

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:10.860
You jump through all kinds of hoops, you do all of these kind of things with your attire,

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:15.860
with the way you wear your hair, with the way you talk, with the way you stand, to try to fit in.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:19.860
Everybody bought the same pair of sneakers, and it was like,

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:25.480
if you didn't have these sneakers, it's like you weren't cool.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:30.480
That desire to fit in can be harmful if it draws you to the wrong crown.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:42.659
The Bible warns bad association spoil useful habits.

00:15:42.659 --> 00:15:46.659
It's the person who shows by his attitude and his way of doing things

00:15:46.659 --> 00:15:48.659
that he doesn't follow Jehovah's principles.

00:15:48.659 --> 00:15:54.659
The Bible's warning against bad association can even apply within the congregation.

00:15:54.659 --> 00:15:57.659
Because like some young people in the congregation,

00:15:57.659 --> 00:16:00.659
like the act one way in the meetings,

00:16:00.659 --> 00:16:04.659
but as soon as they go out, you know, they start acting with different ways.

00:16:04.659 --> 00:16:10.659
Like, who is this? This is the same person that I was in the meeting yesterday.

00:16:10.659 --> 00:16:14.659
Because you can see that there are many young people that are like really rebellious,

00:16:14.659 --> 00:16:19.659
and you can see right away that they're not good associations.

00:16:19.659 --> 00:16:24.659
I think you can tell a lot about a person by what he talks about.

00:16:24.659 --> 00:16:27.659
Does he just talk about having fun?

00:16:27.659 --> 00:16:32.659
Or does he talk about spiritual things?

00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:40.019
You may recognize that certain youths are bad association.

00:16:40.019 --> 00:16:44.019
Still, it may be hard not to envy them.

00:16:44.019 --> 00:16:51.320
When you're around these world of kids and they're all dating and doing the sports thing,

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.320
and you want to be in with what they're doing,

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.320
this times when you want to do stuff,

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.320
and then your parents are like,

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.320
well, they're not good associations stuff,

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:04.319
so you wonder, well, if I can hang out with them,

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:06.319
who am I going to hang out with?

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:12.319
Living by godly standards will limit your choice of friends.

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:21.670
It will also make you stand out as different.

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:24.670
There's a lot of pressure on you as a witness.

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:29.670
They think you're weird that you belong to a sect or something strange.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:32.670
The kids hate me. They would spit on me.

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:35.670
They hit me on the back in class so I couldn't listen.

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:38.670
Every time I went to school, my heart would be pounding.

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:49.480
Faced with such pressures, it may be tempting to hide your Christian beliefs.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:53.480
When I ran into classmates while out in service,

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.480
they would see that I was dressed up,

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.480
and they'd ask me what I was doing,

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:02.480
but I was afraid to tell them that I was preaching.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:06.480
The desire to be liked, to fit in,

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.480
to be like everybody else is powerful,

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:15.480
so powerful that some even secretly crave association with the wrong crowd.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:31.599
Two young Christians recall how bad associations nearly led to their spiritual ruin.

00:18:31.599 --> 00:18:35.599
I got involved in bad association, basically, at school.

00:18:35.599 --> 00:18:41.599
I sought out people who were those things like exciting and cool and fun

00:18:41.599 --> 00:18:45.599
and witnesses that were leading double eyes.

00:18:45.599 --> 00:18:51.599
Some of them sold drugs, anything from marijuana to crack cocaine.

00:18:51.599 --> 00:18:55.599
It pretty much started off with drinking.

00:18:55.599 --> 00:18:58.599
Selling drugs was the end thing to do.

00:18:58.599 --> 00:19:00.599
The guys were going around with beepers.

00:19:00.599 --> 00:19:02.599
They had money.

00:19:02.599 --> 00:19:05.599
For some reason, I felt that I could sell but not use.

00:19:05.599 --> 00:19:14.069
We'd go to some parking lot somewhere and pull out the booze.

00:19:14.069 --> 00:19:17.069
Basically, it was all done at school.

00:19:17.069 --> 00:19:19.069
My mother was out service.

00:19:19.069 --> 00:19:23.069
My dad was working, so they didn't know what I was doing.

00:19:23.069 --> 00:19:29.430
Oh, definitely. It affects you spiritually.

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:32.430
You constantly are feeling guilty, of course.

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:36.430
I really didn't have any love for Jehovah in my heart.

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:40.940
If there was there, I couldn't feel it.

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:43.940
I knew what the Bible said.

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:46.940
As far as the other children in the congregation,

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.940
I could give you the same answers they did.

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:53.940
So it wasn't the head knowledge that, but it just wasn't in my heart.

00:19:53.940 --> 00:20:01.259
There's only so much you can do for so long and you're eventually going to get caught.

00:20:01.259 --> 00:20:08.259
To my mom, she pleaded with me basically to give Jehovah one more chance.

00:20:08.259 --> 00:20:12.259
It all came out, so we had lots of elders meetings.

00:20:12.259 --> 00:20:19.259
So I really made an effort to try to have a relationship myself with Jehovah.

00:20:19.259 --> 00:20:25.259
Oh, telling my parents was harder than anything.

00:20:25.259 --> 00:20:28.259
Because when you're involved in wrongdoing,

00:20:28.259 --> 00:20:30.259
you think, this is me I'm hurting.

00:20:30.259 --> 00:20:33.259
I know I'm hurting myself, but I decide to hurt myself.

00:20:33.259 --> 00:20:35.259
And it doesn't affect anybody else.

00:20:35.259 --> 00:20:40.259
And then to speak to them and let them know how you've let them down.

00:20:40.259 --> 00:20:44.259
I've never seen them be so wounded.

00:20:44.259 --> 00:20:48.259
I changed my association.

00:20:48.259 --> 00:20:54.259
I started hanging around with some of the witness kids in the area.

00:20:54.259 --> 00:20:57.259
And they helped me out a lot.

00:20:57.259 --> 00:21:01.259
My relatives and my friends and the good examples in the congregation,

00:21:01.259 --> 00:21:06.259
they helped me to see that you absolutely have to change your association

00:21:06.259 --> 00:21:09.259
if you want to do good.

00:21:09.259 --> 00:21:19.779
What I regret most is that I wasted all these years

00:21:19.779 --> 00:21:24.779
being selfish when I could have been serving Jehovah.

00:21:24.779 --> 00:21:28.779
My parents, they really had a lot of love for me,

00:21:28.779 --> 00:21:31.779
but I don't know.

00:21:31.779 --> 00:21:35.779
In return, I just gave them basically nothing but heartache.

00:21:35.779 --> 00:21:39.779
And I thought I knew what I could handle and what I couldn't.

00:21:39.779 --> 00:21:42.779
But Jehovah knows what's going to hurt you and what's not.

00:21:42.779 --> 00:21:45.779
And so if you just trust in that,

00:21:45.779 --> 00:21:49.779
you'll have a successful youth without all that pain.

00:21:49.779 --> 00:21:54.660
Life is just so much better for me.

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:58.660
The blessings that you get Jehovah gives you

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:04.660
by just serving him is incomparable to what the world has to offer.
