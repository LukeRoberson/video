WEBVTT

00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:08.609
We now come to the point where we can enjoy the principal talk of our Gilly graduation program

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:16.489
It is entitled the righteous one will get up and we have brother Mark Sanderson of the governing body to deliver that for us

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:23.600
Well for those of you who are

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:25.120
graduating today

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.719
This is indeed one of the happiest days of your entire life and

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.560
rightly so

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:42.560
Because today represents a wonderful milestone in after a years of faithfully pursuing a spiritual career

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.640
But I have to be realistic. I hate to be a downer

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:51.119
at this moment

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:53.359
but realistically

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:55.520
We have to say that not every day

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.960
Of your life ahead is going to be as happy as this one

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.280
Now, why do we say that?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.560
Well, of course we know that Satan rules this world

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.719
And living in this last days that we live in bring us anxiety sometimes even fear

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.920
Life is full of what ifs

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:25.519
In fact those two words what if can send us down all kinds of roads that can be quite terrifying

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:28.480
For you are graduating today

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.159
Maybe it's something like what if I can't learn the new language

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.400
Or what if I can't adapt to a new culture

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.599
Or what if I get home and the brothers have a new assignment for me that I'm not expecting

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.459
Well, that's for you

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:52.260
But for all of us who are here in this audience and perhaps even for our larger audience via broadcasting

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:56.260
Maybe it's questions like what if I face persecution

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.060
Even violent persecution

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.700
What if there's a natural disaster

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.500
What if I become seriously ill

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:08.180
What if I lose a loved one in death

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.099
Well those questions can seem hypothetical

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:18.259
But many of our brothers and sisters around the world are facing those situations right now for them

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:20.259
It's not a matter of what if

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:23.539
It's what is

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.860
Well now brothers while it is absolutely certain

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.539
That we are going to experience calamities

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.580
Because we live in the last days where we expect critical times hard to deal with

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:40.580
There is something that is equally certain

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:42.659
That is know what if

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.460
It's a fundamental principle

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:53.699
That applies to every single righteous and faithful servant of Jehovah and that principle can fill us

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.740
With confidence and courage

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:02.819
Now what is this principle? We open your Bibles. Let's look at Proverbs chapter 24

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:08.699
As you're turning your Bibles there

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:16.620
I'll just remind you that in the Proverbs many of these proverbial thoughts actually are made up of two verses

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:23.180
And so this one begins in verse 15 it begins actually with the warning and this is what it says

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:29.020
Do not wickedly lie in ambush near the home of the righteous one

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.340
Do not destroy his place of rest

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:38.379
Now why? Why is it that you should not attack the righteous one

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:41.979
When I'll notice the reason and here's this fundamental truth

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:49.740
For the righteous one may fall seven times and he will get up again

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:55.180
But the wicked will be made to stumble by calamity

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.460
When I'll let's take this verse apart. What is it really trying to tell us for example? What does it mean to fall

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:10.539
The March 15, 2013 watchtower commenting on Proverbs 24, 16

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:16.379
Defined fall as an adversity or a setback

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.259
One reference work says falls is the word that can simply mean falls over

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.060
Or falls down

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.660
But it also has a figurative meaning of now notices

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:33.019
Experiences disaster

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.100
Or ruin and that is the sense here

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:40.779
Well, what does it mean then to get up

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:49.259
That same reference work goes on to say likewise rises again can mean simply gets up after falling down

00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:52.620
But here it has the figurative sense

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:59.100
Of overcomes adversity or becomes prosperous again

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.620
One now why seven times

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:08.459
The same reference work says most translations render seven times literally

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:15.899
But the figure seven probably has its Hebrew symbolic meaning in this context namely

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.379
completeness

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:20.620
For that reason some translations read

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:25.259
Even if a righteous person falls down many times

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.459
He will always get up

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:31.180
The contemporary English version says

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:35.980
Even if good people fall seven times they will get back up

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:38.779
But when trouble strikes the wicked

00:05:39.579 --> 00:05:43.170
That's the end of them

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:48.370
So what is Proverbs 24 15 and 16 trying to tell us well basically

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:50.850
That when a wicked person

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.250
Experiences calamity he's conquered

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.490
He will not get up

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:59.730
But that is not the case for a righteous one

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.370
A righteous person will get up he will not give up

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.250
He will overcome calamity

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.970
And he will come become prosperous

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.649
Again in fact verse 15 in effect says

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:18.449
Don't even try to set a trap for the righteous one

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:21.730
Because no matter how hard you knock him down

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:24.689
He's going to get up again

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:33.329
Now why why is it that the righteous one gets up is it because he's just so strong he's just so personally resilient no

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:37.009
I want you to look at the cross reference

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.930
On Proverbs 24 16 you see the scripture

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:45.089
It's Psalm 34 verse 19

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:51.490
Now here the Psalmist David expresses a similar thought to what we just read here in Proverbs

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.490
But he adds an important detail

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.129
That verse says many are the hardships

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.930
Or if you look at the footnote

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.209
calamities of the righteous one

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.569
But Jehovah rescues him from them all

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:14.290
So Jehovah helps the righteous one to get up

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.009
In fact if we go back to that March 15 2013 watchdower

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.209
When it commented on Proverbs 24 16

00:07:22.769 --> 00:07:30.370
It's that Jehovah will not allow those trusting in him to stumble or to experience a fall

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.370
That is an adversity or a setback in their worship

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.810
From which they cannot recover

00:07:38.209 --> 00:07:40.529
When I'm brothers, what does that mean?

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:45.329
Does it mean that somehow Jehovah is going to intervene miraculously

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:49.649
Every time one of his servants experiences calamity? No

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:58.370
But Jehovah has taught his righteous ones what they need to do in times of calamity

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:03.569
They know that they must keep on seeking first God's kingdom

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:13.089
And God's righteousness as Matthew 633 says and so what does the righteous one do when calamity comes

00:08:13.889 --> 00:08:16.529
You see it doesn't stop the righteous one from praying

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:21.810
It doesn't stop him from attending meetings or talking to others about his faith

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:29.490
No, he keeps on doing what pleases Jehovah even in the face of calamity

00:08:30.529 --> 00:08:32.289
And doing what is right

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:39.570
Is what helps him to recover from whatever calamity may come upon him

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:46.450
Now the Apostle Paul is a wonderful example of the truth of this principle

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:51.809
Let's look at 2nd Corinthians chapter 11 and let's just remind ourselves

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:57.169
Of some of the calamities that came upon the Apostle Paul

00:08:58.129 --> 00:09:00.129
2nd Corinthians 11

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:06.450
Let's begin reading in verse 23 Paul says are they ministers of Christ?

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:12.610
I reply like a madman. I am more outstandingly one. I have done more work

00:09:12.929 --> 00:09:19.169
Been in prison more often suffered countless beatings and experienced many near deaths

00:09:20.049 --> 00:09:23.730
Five times I received 40 strokes less one from the Jews

00:09:24.289 --> 00:09:26.289
Three times I was beaten with rods

00:09:27.169 --> 00:09:29.169
Once I was stoned

00:09:29.169 --> 00:09:31.649
Three times I experienced shipwreck

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.490
A night and a day I have spent in the open sea

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.129
In journeys often

00:09:38.129 --> 00:09:39.970
Endangers from rivers

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:42.049
Endangers from robbers

00:09:42.049 --> 00:09:44.529
Endangers from my own people

00:09:44.529 --> 00:09:46.850
Endangers from the nations

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:48.929
Endangers in the city

00:09:48.929 --> 00:09:51.330
Endangers in the wilderness

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.730
Endangers at sea

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.889
Endangers among false brothers

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:59.970
In labor and toil in sleepless nights often

00:10:00.929 --> 00:10:03.090
In hunger and thirst

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.570
Frequently without food

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:07.250
In cold

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.490
And lacking clothing

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:11.730
When out brothers honestly

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:15.889
Many people would have been conquered by just one of those things, isn't it true

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:21.490
But Paul kept getting up he kept getting up and going on

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:26.289
And what was his conclusion? We'll just read it in second Corinthians

00:10:27.169 --> 00:10:29.169
chapter four

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:33.139
And look at here at verse eight

00:10:33.139 --> 00:10:37.139
Paul says we are hard pressed in every way

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.259
But not cramped beyond movement

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.220
We are perplexed

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.539
But not absolutely with no way out

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.980
We are persecuted

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.220
But not abandoned and now notice this one

00:10:52.019 --> 00:10:53.220
We are knocked down

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.580
But not destroyed

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:57.779
Always

00:10:57.779 --> 00:11:01.299
We endure in our body the death-dealing treatment that Jesus suffered

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.980
That the life of Jesus may also be made manifest

00:11:06.019 --> 00:11:07.220
in our body

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.220
Did you see that?

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.220
Knocked down

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.740
Knocked down

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.740
But not destroyed

00:11:15.139 --> 00:11:18.100
Righteous Paul was not destroyed

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:21.620
By the adverse experiences that came to him

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.659
He didn't allow calamity

00:11:24.659 --> 00:11:27.379
To stop him from giving that next witness

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:31.379
From offering that next prayer to Jehovah

00:11:31.379 --> 00:11:34.820
From taking advantage of the next opportunity

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.740
To meet with his brothers

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.940
You see that's what a righteous person does

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:45.539
He keeps on seeking Jehovah, seeking to please him

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.179
And because Paul did that

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.860
He was always able to get up

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.259
With the help of Jehovah

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:57.460
But now brothers that's true for Paul

00:11:59.059 --> 00:12:03.620
But it's also true for every one of God's faithful

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.820
And righteous servants all around this earth

00:12:08.259 --> 00:12:10.259
I'd like to introduce to you

00:12:11.059 --> 00:12:13.779
Three different faithful servants of Jehovah

00:12:14.419 --> 00:12:16.580
Who have also experienced the truth

00:12:17.299 --> 00:12:20.740
Of Proverbs chapter 24 and verse 16

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:26.500
This is brother Michael Legaspi from the Philippines

00:12:27.779 --> 00:12:31.059
When typhoon high-end struck in 2013

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:33.940
Michael went with his wife

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.340
And his young son to the kingdom hall

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.500
In Takloban city to seek shelter

00:12:39.539 --> 00:12:41.860
There had been many typhoons before

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:45.220
This was not an unusual event in the Philippines

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.299
But this time there was something different

00:12:50.419 --> 00:12:52.820
This was the first time in recent memory

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.299
That there was a storm surge

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:57.539
A wall of water

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.179
15 feet high

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.820
Or four and a half meters high

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.820
Struck the kingdom hall

00:13:06.179 --> 00:13:08.419
The walls and the roof collapsed

00:13:09.379 --> 00:13:11.779
Michael worked very very hard

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.179
To try to rescue his wife

00:13:14.899 --> 00:13:18.100
And the other brothers and sisters that were trapped under the debris

00:13:19.299 --> 00:13:22.500
But sadly his wife had already perished

00:13:24.419 --> 00:13:26.980
Then in the water by this time

00:13:27.779 --> 00:13:29.779
He heard his son cry out to him

00:13:30.019 --> 00:13:31.620
Papa Papa

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:34.419
He reached out

00:13:35.299 --> 00:13:37.220
And he grabbed him in the water

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.580
But because of his exhaustion

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:44.100
From already helping the brothers to escape

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.419
From under the debris

00:13:47.139 --> 00:13:49.460
And because of the cold temperature of the water

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.700
He became unconscious

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.100
And when he woke up

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.100
His son was gone

00:13:57.539 --> 00:14:00.259
He too had perished in the storm

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:05.460
Well at first Michael was inconsolable

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.539
He blamed himself

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.460
He felt that there was something more that he could have done

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:12.740
To save them

00:14:14.259 --> 00:14:15.940
But the elders shepherded him

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.500
They helped him to see that there was nothing

00:14:19.059 --> 00:14:20.179
That he could have done

00:14:20.259 --> 00:14:23.860
The storm was beyond the power of any man

00:14:25.539 --> 00:14:27.779
But even in those difficult times

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:31.700
Michael continued with his spiritual program

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.779
He continued to serve as an elder

00:14:34.659 --> 00:14:36.340
And as a regular pioneer

00:14:37.299 --> 00:14:38.899
The brothers encouraged him

00:14:39.139 --> 00:14:43.220
Why don't you begin to volunteer at the disaster relief center

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.379
The whole area was completely devastated

00:14:47.379 --> 00:14:49.860
All the homes had been destroyed

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:51.860
Michael got busy

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:57.379
And worked to help rebuild the homes of the local brothers

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:00.580
And when that work was finished

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.980
He enrolled as a construction volunteer

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.779
Working with a group of brothers

00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:08.580
Building kingdom halls within the region

00:15:09.779 --> 00:15:11.779
And then when that work was complete

00:15:13.059 --> 00:15:15.700
He volunteered to help a congregation

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.379
That was quite a distance away

00:15:17.379 --> 00:15:20.259
It required him to travel one and a half hours

00:15:20.259 --> 00:15:22.019
Each way by motorcycle

00:15:23.139 --> 00:15:26.100
But he was willing to do it because the congregation

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.860
Needed the help of an elder

00:15:29.299 --> 00:15:30.019
When out here

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:31.700
Is Michael today

00:15:32.659 --> 00:15:33.139
Busy

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:34.659
Active

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.259
In Jehovah's service

00:15:36.899 --> 00:15:39.220
Just like all righteous ones

00:15:40.019 --> 00:15:42.580
Michael kept doing Jehovah's will

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:46.100
Despite the terrible calamity that he experienced

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.620
Now what do you think brothers

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.220
Do you think Michael got up

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:03.970
This is Timur Akmedov

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:06.049
Who lives in Kazakhstan

00:16:07.009 --> 00:16:10.850
In 2017 Timur was arrested on a false charge

00:16:11.409 --> 00:16:13.169
Of inciting religious hatred

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:17.330
After being in pretrial detention for three months

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:21.809
Timur was sentenced to a five year prison term

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:24.210
Before his arrest

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:27.490
Timur was being treated for cancer

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:31.009
When he was arrested his treatment stopped

00:16:31.889 --> 00:16:33.889
And the disease began to progress

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:36.210
Now you talk about calamity

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.730
Not only is he imprisoned because of his faith

00:16:40.289 --> 00:16:42.370
He also has to deal with life

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:44.610
Threatening cancer at the same time

00:16:45.809 --> 00:16:47.250
After being in

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:49.330
After being held for 13 months

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:52.769
Timur was finally allowed to go to another city

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:54.850
For medical care

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:56.049
Now here

00:16:56.049 --> 00:16:59.169
You see Timur after surgery in his hospital bed

00:16:59.169 --> 00:16:59.889
But do you notice

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:01.730
He's chained

00:17:02.529 --> 00:17:03.490
Both at the arm

00:17:04.289 --> 00:17:05.089
And at the leg

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:09.789
After the courts had rejected multiple

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:12.829
Appeals to have Timur released

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:15.069
It appeared that it was impossible

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:17.069
All options had been exhausted

00:17:18.509 --> 00:17:20.589
Yet Timur was told at this point

00:17:21.549 --> 00:17:22.829
You can be released

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:25.869
If you're willing to sign a confession

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:29.789
The authorities told him to write out

00:17:30.349 --> 00:17:32.190
That he had made a mistake

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:35.150
In speaking to other people about his beliefs

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.029
And that he was now sorry for his actions

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:42.190
Timur absolutely refused

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:47.549
He told the authorities that he would rather sit in prison with a clear conscience

00:17:47.549 --> 00:17:50.029
Than be released with a guilty one

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:53.869
Well by Jehovah's undeserved kindness

00:17:54.589 --> 00:17:56.829
After 14 and a half months in prison

00:17:57.549 --> 00:17:59.630
The president of Kazakhstan

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:01.630
Gave Timur a full pardon

00:18:02.269 --> 00:18:04.029
Without any admission of guilt

00:18:05.069 --> 00:18:06.269
And he was released

00:18:07.069 --> 00:18:07.869
Here you see

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:10.269
Timur in a recent photo

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:12.430
Taken with his dear wife

00:18:13.869 --> 00:18:14.509
What was it

00:18:15.309 --> 00:18:16.990
That helped Timur to get up

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:19.309
Despite imprisonment

00:18:19.309 --> 00:18:21.710
And dealing with life-threatening illness

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:22.589
This is what he said

00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:25.789
We each have a choice

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:29.150
Whether to stand by God's principles

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:30.109
Or ignore them

00:18:31.069 --> 00:18:33.309
If we stand by God's principles

00:18:33.869 --> 00:18:36.349
Then we can get through any test

00:18:37.069 --> 00:18:37.869
Successfully

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:39.549
Timur

00:18:40.269 --> 00:18:43.069
Overcame the adversity

00:18:43.069 --> 00:18:43.869
Would you agree?

00:18:44.509 --> 00:18:45.549
He truly got up

00:18:56.349 --> 00:18:57.950
This is sister Laura French

00:18:59.309 --> 00:19:00.990
She began Bethel's service

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:04.269
On May 1st 1926

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:08.589
She was part of this small Bethel family in Canada

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:11.309
Made up of less than 20 persons

00:19:11.789 --> 00:19:14.509
About 1936

00:19:15.309 --> 00:19:18.829
It became apparent that the branch servant in Canada

00:19:18.829 --> 00:19:20.029
Was in apostate

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:23.549
In time the matter was investigated

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:27.470
And although sister French was not involved with the apostasy

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:30.829
She had been a roommate with one of the sisters

00:19:30.829 --> 00:19:33.549
Who was working closely with the branch servant

00:19:34.509 --> 00:19:36.509
Thus she was wrongly viewed

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:38.750
As one of his supporters

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:42.589
And so on May 1st 1936

00:19:42.589 --> 00:19:46.029
She was among a group of seven Bethelites

00:19:46.029 --> 00:19:47.950
Who were dismissed from Bethel

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:50.269
Along with the branch servant

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:52.990
What did sister French do?

00:19:54.109 --> 00:19:55.309
She never complained

00:19:56.269 --> 00:19:58.269
She did not say that it was unfair

00:19:58.910 --> 00:19:59.710
Or unjust

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:03.069
Although she said initially she was hurt

00:20:04.109 --> 00:20:06.589
She decided that the best remedy would be

00:20:06.589 --> 00:20:09.150
To go on serving Jehovah

00:20:10.029 --> 00:20:12.029
She said after leaving Bethel

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:17.230
I had four marvelous years in the Pioneer service

00:20:18.109 --> 00:20:19.230
The first two years

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:22.670
She and another sister lived in a tent

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:25.950
While preaching in a large area

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:29.470
Where there were no congregations of Jehovah's people

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:33.950
Later she and her pioneer partner work from a house car

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:39.630
These faithful sisters truly work hard for Jehovah

00:20:40.269 --> 00:20:45.630
Well in 1940 sister French came to Toronto for a short vacation

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:50.750
When suddenly the ban on Jehovah's Witnesses struck

00:20:52.029 --> 00:20:54.670
To her surprise and delight

00:20:55.309 --> 00:21:00.029
She was invited to come and work at the underground branch office

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:03.150
And with the approval of brother Rutherford

00:21:03.789 --> 00:21:08.670
Sister French returned to Bethel's service in 1940

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:15.470
And continued to serve there until she finished her earthly course on December 23rd

00:21:16.349 --> 00:21:17.309
1990

00:21:18.509 --> 00:21:20.190
At the end of her earthly life

00:21:21.069 --> 00:21:23.069
She said she was so happy

00:21:23.789 --> 00:21:26.589
That she had decided to go pioneering

00:21:26.589 --> 00:21:28.430
When she was dismissed from Bethel

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:31.470
Of that group that were dismissed

00:21:32.269 --> 00:21:37.390
She was the only one who continued to serve Jehovah faithfully

00:21:38.829 --> 00:21:42.190
Sister French kept doing the right thing

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:45.950
Even when she was misjudged by others

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:49.950
She overcame an unjust situation

00:21:50.589 --> 00:21:52.589
She overcame that adversity

00:21:53.069 --> 00:21:55.549
She truly got up. Do you agree?

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:08.900
Well brothers, what have we learned?

00:22:09.539 --> 00:22:15.140
From considering this principle in Proverbs chapter 24 and verse 16

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.099
When calamity strikes

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:21.539
You truly may feel knocked down

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:27.779
You may not know the details of exactly how everything is going to work out

00:22:29.059 --> 00:22:31.539
But you will always know what to do next

00:22:32.579 --> 00:22:33.779
You'll know how to pray

00:22:34.819 --> 00:22:36.900
You'll know to go to that next meeting

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:39.700
You'll know to go out in the ministry

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:45.140
You'll know to always make decisions that will please Jehovah

00:22:46.259 --> 00:22:47.460
And as you do so

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.819
Jehovah will show you the way to move on

00:22:51.779 --> 00:22:56.099
And to get up from any calamity that you might face

00:22:57.299 --> 00:22:59.299
That was true of the Apostle Paul

00:23:00.579 --> 00:23:02.579
That was true of Michael Legaspi

00:23:03.779 --> 00:23:05.700
It was true of Timurak Medov

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.579
It was true of Laura French

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.420
And it will be true for all of you

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:14.500
Remember this

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.940
When calamity knocks you down

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:22.019
Seek Jehovah and you'll rebound

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:25.420
What does the principle say

00:23:26.299 --> 00:23:27.740
For though the righteous one

00:23:28.859 --> 00:23:30.700
May fall seven times

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:33.660
He will get up

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:35.819
again

00:23:35.819 --> 00:23:38.059
And with that confidence in your hearts

00:23:39.099 --> 00:23:41.339
May you go to your assignments

00:23:41.339 --> 00:23:42.539
With all of our love

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.940
And with the rich blessing

00:23:45.579 --> 00:23:46.940
Of our marvelous

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:48.140
Our amazing God

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:49.180
Jehovah

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.900
Well that brings us now

00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:00.420
To the point in our program for the presentation of the diplomas

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:04.099
And I will be assisted in this by

00:24:04.099 --> 00:24:05.940
Our dear brother Kenneth Flodin

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:14.130
First couple is brother and sister Agarwal

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:15.569
They'll be returning to India

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.519
And we have brother

00:24:27.519 --> 00:24:29.759
But Sakan will go back to Mongolia

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:39.730
Brother and sister Cheposa will return to Zambia

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.720
Brother and sister Chico going back to Romania

00:24:55.779 --> 00:24:57.220
Brother and sister Dylan

00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:58.259
Returning to India

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.259
And now we have brother and sister

00:25:07.259 --> 00:25:09.420
Grawishevsky going back to Finland

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.299
Brother and sister Dredge will be returning to Thailand

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:27.579
And this is brother and sister

00:25:28.299 --> 00:25:29.420
Happier in me

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:31.019
They're going back to Rwanda

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:41.150
Brother Horbath

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:42.509
Back to Hungary

00:25:49.259 --> 00:25:51.420
And brother, you're Kinsky to Poland

00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:59.630
And this is brother and sister Lofran Shua

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:29.950
I was influenced by the video

00:27:40.049 --> 00:27:43.170
And brother and sister Sandoval will now be going to Spain

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.500
Brother Sasaki will be returning to Japan

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:01.549
And brother and sister Sando

Will be going back to Trinidad and Tobago

00:28:10.589 --> 00:28:12.190
Brother and sister Siva Kumaran

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:14.109
Will be returning to Sri Lanka

00:28:22.859 --> 00:28:24.700
And now we have brother and sister Wilson

And they're going to be assigned to Congo Kinshasa

00:28:40.559 --> 00:28:41.759
Brother and sister Wuzli

00:28:42.559 --> 00:28:44.319
They'll now be assigned to Asia

00:28:44.559 --> 00:28:57.819
And now we have our final couple

00:28:57.819 --> 00:28:59.180
Brother and sister Jino Nuz

They'll be going to Greece

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:18.420
And we want to thank brother Flodin

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:20.019
for caring for all those names

00:29:20.819 --> 00:29:21.220
for me

00:29:22.339 --> 00:29:23.380
That's such a big help

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:27.460
Well now it's a pleasure to present to you

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:31.619
the graduates of the 146th class of Gilead

00:29:43.259 --> 00:29:46.220
And the class has a letter that will now be read

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:49.740
And brother Philip Morgan will do that for us

00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:01.230
To the governing body and the United States' Bethel family

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:05.230
Over the course of the past five months

00:30:05.789 --> 00:30:07.150
More than ever before

00:30:07.869 --> 00:30:11.950
We have been tuned to the evidence of Jahaova's powerful holy spirit

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:12.910
All around us

00:30:13.869 --> 00:30:17.950
From the day we entered the main lobby here at the Watchtower Educational Center

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:20.990
The fruitage of that spirit enveloped us

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:22.190
With love

00:30:23.069 --> 00:30:27.549
Kindness through the hospitality of the United States' Bethel family

00:30:29.069 --> 00:30:31.309
Without your daily help and encouragement

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:36.029
We would not have been able to give such concentrated focus to our studies

00:30:36.829 --> 00:30:39.789
We thank you all from the bottom of our hearts

00:30:40.509 --> 00:30:43.549
We also sensed how our instructors

00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:47.470
Have striven to allow the holy spirit to shape and mold them

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:52.029
Even as they shared the benefits of their own deep study of God's word

00:30:52.029 --> 00:30:55.309
And experience with us each day in the classroom

00:30:56.829 --> 00:30:59.630
Just like those Jahaova used to train others in the past

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:04.190
They imparted to us not only the finer points of the truth

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:06.349
But their very souls

00:31:07.069 --> 00:31:09.069
They became beloved to us

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:11.710
Even as we know we are to them

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:20.029
Perhaps most touching has been the personal attention shown to us by your dear brothers of the governing body

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:23.789
The evidence of Jahaova's spirit working through you

00:31:24.509 --> 00:31:27.069
Is something we will cherish for the rest of our lives

00:31:28.589 --> 00:31:30.990
We realize how much concern you carry with you

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:34.589
For the entire association of our brothers worldwide

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:39.230
As well as for the many sheep like ones yet to be reached with the kingdom good news

00:31:40.509 --> 00:31:42.750
We especially appreciated the fact

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:46.190
That you each took time to spend with our class

00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:49.710
And spoke to us as a father to children

00:31:50.509 --> 00:31:51.470
To reassure us

00:31:52.509 --> 00:31:54.190
To protect us with reminders

00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:59.549
And to build confidence that Jahaova will be with us in the days ahead

00:32:00.589 --> 00:32:03.390
And you sent many of your helpers to do just the same

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:05.549
Which we deeply appreciated

00:32:07.619 --> 00:32:10.099
The Apostle Paul reminded his anointed brothers

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:12.900
That where the spirit of Jahaova is

00:32:13.619 --> 00:32:14.579
There is freedom

00:32:15.779 --> 00:32:18.980
Now more than ever we see evidence of how true that is

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:21.619
By means of his faithful slave

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:23.779
The Giliad arrangement

00:32:23.779 --> 00:32:25.940
And this beautiful Bethel family

00:32:26.579 --> 00:32:28.420
Jahaova has used his spirit

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:31.539
To free us from any inhibitions

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:34.099
Fears or hesitations

00:32:34.819 --> 00:32:38.259
We feel more prepared to accomplish whatever work he assigns

00:32:38.819 --> 00:32:42.660
By relying on that most powerful force in the universe

00:32:43.299 --> 00:32:44.579
God's Holy Spirit

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:48.740
Along with the rest of God's family of servants

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:50.420
Heavenly and earthly

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:54.740
We are ready to follow the leading of that spirit

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.539
Wherever it will send us in the days ahead

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.180
With heartfelt love

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:02.740
We are your brothers and sisters

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:05.380
Of the 146th class of Giliad

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:12.799
Graduates

00:33:12.799 --> 00:33:14.559
That is a nice sound to it, doesn't it

00:33:15.599 --> 00:33:16.559
It came quickly

00:33:17.519 --> 00:33:22.240
Well, I've been asked to give a few comments here at the end and to include

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.359
This point, so I'll begin with it

00:33:26.319 --> 00:33:27.920
Back in 2011

00:33:29.039 --> 00:33:33.200
The governing body adjusted the objective of Giliad training

00:33:33.839 --> 00:33:37.359
In order to help further strengthen and stabilize

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.680
The field and branch organization

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.000
And as a result

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.359
We have seen Jahaova's rich blessing on this adjustment

00:33:45.359 --> 00:33:49.119
As it relates to branching country committees worldwide

00:33:50.079 --> 00:33:54.400
Since the time of the graduation of the 132nd class

00:33:55.119 --> 00:33:57.119
182 graduates

00:33:57.839 --> 00:34:00.559
Have been appointed to a committee either during

00:34:01.119 --> 00:34:03.920
Or sometime after their training at Giliad

00:34:05.119 --> 00:34:06.640
That's a wonderful fact, isn't it

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:13.119
And it's something that is really proving to be a blessing

00:34:13.119 --> 00:34:15.599
To the worldwide field in our dear brotherhood

00:34:15.599 --> 00:34:16.400
And above all

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:19.840
In upholding and honoring Jahaova's name

00:34:20.559 --> 00:34:22.639
So this is a marvelous arrangement

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:26.320
Now with this in mind just for a couple of minutes

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:29.119
I want to give concluding comments on this topic

00:34:30.079 --> 00:34:32.320
Maintain your shield of faith

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.320
You see when you're settled into your assignments

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.440
Perhaps with new responsibilities

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:42.320
Remember to remain watchful

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.920
So that you stay focused on what is most important

00:34:46.559 --> 00:34:49.360
Namely the doing of Jahaova's will

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:56.960
The danger can come when we feel that we've achieved most or even all of our spiritual goals

00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:59.920
If we allow that to happen

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.960
Our interests could turn to other things

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:09.119
For example, if we lose sight of the point and the purpose behind what it means to follow Jesus

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:13.760
We could start to center our thoughts on other goals. It could happen

00:35:14.559 --> 00:35:16.559
Perhaps even material things

00:35:16.559 --> 00:35:18.559
But don't let this happen to you

00:35:18.719 --> 00:35:21.280
Keep your shield of faith strong

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.920
And Bible times

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.760
Soldiers repaired and secured their shields between battles

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:32.079
They treasured those protective pieces of armor

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.519
Because their shields were often covered with leather

00:35:36.079 --> 00:35:40.320
The soldiers would rub oil onto the shield to help preserve it

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:43.119
And to keep the metal parts free from rust

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:47.280
If a soldier found damage or weakness what did he do

00:35:48.079 --> 00:35:51.440
He immediately made the needed repairs to his shield

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:55.280
In this way he was always ready for the next battle

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.320
We need to keep this up in a spiritual way

00:35:59.119 --> 00:36:04.079
Over time a brother or sister might lay down his or her shield of faith

00:36:04.639 --> 00:36:07.760
And go after things that have no lasting value

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.920
The devil wants nothing more for us

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.320
Then to neglect our faith

00:36:13.119 --> 00:36:16.719
And open up our heart to his attacks and for this reason

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:20.239
Paul the Apostle Paul was inspired to say

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.880
That those who go after

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:28.400
Material riches for instance would cultivate many senseless and harmful desires

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.960
He added flee from these things

00:36:31.599 --> 00:36:36.400
You see ultimately we are each responsible for how large

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.360
How strong our shield of faith proves to be

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:45.760
Now we show that we are strengthening our faith in Jehovah and his Son

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:50.639
When we take time to continue caring for our spiritual needs

00:36:50.639 --> 00:36:53.119
So don't take liberties with your spiritual routine

00:36:53.679 --> 00:36:57.440
Just because you've graduated from this wonderful school

00:36:58.079 --> 00:37:03.760
Don't become self-satisfied because of resting on a privilege you may come to enjoy

00:37:04.559 --> 00:37:07.039
That's not the point of it is it

00:37:07.039 --> 00:37:12.400
Keep growing as a spiritual person by giving attention to your faith day by day

00:37:13.199 --> 00:37:15.199
Oil and preserve your shield

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:21.760
By regularly attending Christian meetings and speaking about Jehovah's name and his kingdom to others

00:37:22.639 --> 00:37:29.440
Also maintain strong faith by reading God's word every day as you've been encouraged and have been doing

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.320
And applying its counsel on all that you do

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:36.079
imitate the Christ every step of the way

00:37:36.639 --> 00:37:39.840
And this way you'll be like the victorious soldier who worked hard

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:44.960
To care for his shield and other valuable pieces of armor

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.840
Hold your shield firmly in front of you

00:37:48.559 --> 00:37:53.519
Use it to protect your figurative heart and to defend Jehovah's pure worship

00:37:54.239 --> 00:37:55.840
Keep it well maintained

00:37:56.559 --> 00:38:00.719
And you will always be ready to fight the fine fight of the faith

00:38:01.599 --> 00:38:04.000
Jehovah and his Son will bless you for it
