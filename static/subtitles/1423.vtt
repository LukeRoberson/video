00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:13.990
Armenia is an ancient country with rich history, situated in the lands of Mount Erad.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:23.019
In the Caucasus region, Lake Sevan is considered to be a prized jewel.

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:28.019
Diversity of its flora and fauna contribute to the unique and beautiful countryside.

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:37.810
Yerevan, the capital, is a modern metropolis with picturesque views that remind many of Paris,

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.810
with its trees, cafes, and beautiful water fountains.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.810
What is this?

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.810
Recently, a special three-week preaching campaign took place.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:58.409
Groups of Armenia speaking Jehovah's Witnesses from six different countries

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:07.620
wholeheartedly responded to the invitation.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.620
The main purpose of the campaign was to cover as many of the 512 unassigned territories

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.620
as possible, with the Kingdom Good News.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.620
Thus, an opportunity for an interchange of encouragement was created for both the local friends

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.250
and the campaign participants.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:37.750
They were warmly greeted at the airport by local brothers and sisters.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:45.750
The Witnesses made good use of their tablets and smartphones to show videos from the JW.org website.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.750
Armenia is also currently home to over 11,000 Western Armenia refugees.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.750
A special effort was made to share with these individuals the positive message of hope and peace

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.750
from the Bible in their native tongue, West Armenia.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.750
Metropolitan Witnessing served as an effective way to reach these ones.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.750
It was the first time in my life that I participated in public witnessing and it was very encouraging.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.750
When individuals would approach us and show interest, I could explain to them the truth in their own language.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.750
It was amazing.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.750
It's been very heartwarming.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.750
People have really responded well.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.750
They were in need of comfort and the good news, especially those that we came for.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.750
The Western Armenians pretty much every door invited us in and they were very hospitable and receptive.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:43.750
After we heard an announcement about a special campaign in a Western language that's going to take place in Armenia,

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.750
we said we cannot miss this.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.750
We have to be there and bring our share in this very joyful preaching campaign.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:58.750
During the three-week campaign, over 15,000 pieces of Bible-based literature were left with interested ones

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.750
and over 200 Bible studies were started.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:10.770
We were very happy to see how many brothers and sisters were ready to come for the campaign in Armenia,

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.770
from different countries around the world.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.770
That response showed that Jehovah has blessed our efforts.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:25.770
Those who came from far and wide greatly appreciated the share they had in this special event.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:34.770
Everyone was so happy to see us and when we were giving them a Bible, they were so excited to find answers from their own Bible.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.770
I so blessed to be here.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.770
This has been the best vacation that we have had as a family.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:50.770
The first time I came to Armenia, I was in 1982 and I looked for the witnesses and I hardly found just a few.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:04:01.770
But now that I came for this campaign, we have 11,000 witnesses. I'm really so happy. I really want to come back.

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:11.770
It is our hope that Jehovah God continues to help all sorts of people to be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.
