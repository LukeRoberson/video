00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.559
Okay, good, now point six.

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:06.719
What Jehovah does for his friends?

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:09.080
Cassie, can you tap that link?

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.560
Jehovah has done so much for me.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:21.129
When I was 14, things that happened in the past started to catch up with me emotionally.

00:00:21.129 --> 00:00:28.359
And I felt like everything that had happened in my life was my fault.

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.759
Learning from the Bible that God says that He will take my right hand,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.159
that He will fortify me, that He will really help me.

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:47.960
It blew me away.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:55.439
She mentioned a Bible passage where Jehovah takes our hand.

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:56.679
Can you read that?

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:01.640
At Isaiah 41, 10 and 13.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:08.620
Please, do not be afraid, Brian, with you.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.659
Do not be anxious for I am your God.

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.260
I will fortify you.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.780
Yes, I will help you.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.180
I will really hold on to you with my right hand of righteousness.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.180
13, for I Jehovah your God and grasping your right hand.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.859
The one saying to you, do not be afraid, I will help you.

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:33.019
So, Cassie, according to these verses, what is Jehovah promised to do for all of his friends?

00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:35.260
Help us when we're down or scared?

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.859
Yes.

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:39.900
Let's look a little closer, though.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.180
I will fortify, I will help, I will really hold on.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:52.219
Does that sound like a friend who can help or a friend who wants to help?

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:58.299
I never thought of God, Jehovah, like that.

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.980
Do you think that Jehovah would make a good friend?

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:02.980
Sure.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.939
Why?

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:13.819
In verse 10, Jehovah stretches out his hand to you, which one?

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.259
His right.

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:22.219
And then in verse 13, he takes your hand, which one?

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:23.219
My right.

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:24.219
How?

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:29.250
Cassie, come here.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:43.129
So is Jehovah beside you holding your hand or is he in front?

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:44.490
That's it.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.250
His right hand, taking your right hand.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.849
He's facing you.

00:02:51.849 --> 00:03:10.460
To pull you up and out, Cassie, what is Jehovah pulled you out of?

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:17.680
Oh, bless us, and that is a direct result of friendship with Jehovah.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.319
It grows stronger, the more we talk to him.

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.000
Let's look at that in the next section, okay?
