00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.459
The meek will inherit the earth.

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:10.339
We are all familiar with those words, aren't we, from Psalm 37, verse 11?

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:16.100
Now, doubt we've used them in the ministry to hope others have a hope for the future.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.539
But what does it really mean for someone to be meek?

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.739
Well, we get a hope with regard to the definition.

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:31.379
If we turn to the words of our Lord Jesus and is recorded in Matthew, chapter 5, and verse 5,

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:35.700
so Matthew 5 and verse 5.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.539
And here Jesus is recorded as saying,

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:45.619
Happy are the mild tempered since they will inherit the earth.

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:52.420
You'll notice there's a slightly different expression that Jesus used here as recorded in Greek,

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.820
and that is being mild tempered.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.420
If we look at this study note, we'll notice a very interesting comment.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.500
It says, the Greek term does not imply a cowardice or weakness.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.459
In the Septuragant, the word was used as an equivalent for a Hebrew word

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:13.540
that can be translated meek or humble.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.299
So we see because, even though Jesus spoke in Hebrew, but it was recorded in Greek,

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:24.180
this translation of the word mild tempered is there in the text.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.939
And mild tempered helps us a little to understand the word meek.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.859
Mild tempered means not hot tempered.

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:34.260
It doesn't mean saying someone is cold either.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.859
It just means that they're balanced with how they handle the reaction to things.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.420
The inside volume makes this comment.

00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:50.019
Being meek or mild tempered enables a person to endure injury with patience,

00:01:50.019 --> 00:01:55.379
without irritation, without resentment, or of indicative retaliation.

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.659
So that's what's involved with being meek.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.500
The watchtower from which the comments are taken reminds us that no one in this sinful world

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.580
is born with meekness.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.939
It's something that we need to develop, and it's something that we need to keep on working on.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.939
For example, our text refers to Moses.

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:25.780
Now you'd notice there in the scripture, it doesn't just say Moses was meek.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.259
It doesn't just say Moses was the meekest man.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.939
What does it say?

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.379
He was by far the meekest man.

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.699
Now that's very interesting.

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:44.180
We'd all like to have that set of us, wouldn't we?

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:50.979
But when we look at what happened just toward the end of the 40 years in the wilderness,

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:55.219
we see that Moses reacted badly.

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:57.539
And what was it that caused him to do so?

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.659
It was because of his reaction to persons who frustrated him, irritated him,

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.379
those who it seemed always rejected the word of Jehovah.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.300
So what's the lesson in this verse today?

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.460
Well, our meekness, too, can be challenged.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.139
In a similar way, it can be in the frustrations of dealings with others.

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:27.300
Or even in these difficult times in which we're living now,

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:35.460
seeing shortages of food and medicine, and perhaps seeing persons with their shopping trolleys

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.699
full of items that we know they shouldn't have got so many things.

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:45.460
But here they are, getting away with all this produce and so on.

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:48.099
And yet here we are, we don't have enough.

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.580
Well, that can be a test of meekness.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.259
Looking at television programs and seeing what the world leaders are saying,

00:03:56.259 --> 00:04:00.659
what politicians are arguing about can also be a test of meekness.

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:04.900
Seeing prejudice and unfairness in our lives.

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:10.340
All these things can be just like the situation with Moses.

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:14.500
We can be tested with regard to our meekness.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.139
So now here's the question, what will help us to remain meek,

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.139
what will help us to develop meekness?

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.259
Well, the first thing we'd like to mention is a very important thing.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.620
And that is for us to strengthen our trust in Jehovah and to put our hope in him.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.819
So let's go back to the words that we mentioned in the beginning,

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:42.819
taken from Psalm 37.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.699
Let's read the context, thinking of what we just discussed,

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:55.540
about the tests that we may face now or even in the future that may test our meekness.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:01.699
So Psalm 37, let's read verses 7 through 11,

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:09.730
keep silent before Jehovah and wait expectantly for him.

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:13.410
Do we see the key to maintaining meekness?

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.930
Yes, waiting on Jehovah.

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:23.490
Then it goes on to say, do not be upset by the man who succeeds in carrying out his schemes.

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:28.209
Let go of anger and abandon rage.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.129
Do not become upset and turn to doing evil.

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:35.810
For evil men will be done away with.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.490
But those hoping in Jehovah will possess the earth.

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:46.529
Just a little while longer and the wicked will be no more.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.850
You will look at where they were and they will not be there.

00:05:51.810 --> 00:06:00.370
But the meek will possess the earth and they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.370
When we read these words, particularly at this time in which we're living now,

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.569
don't they take on deeper meaning for us?

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:17.089
Yes, for us to show meekness, we have to trust fully in Jehovah our God.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.810
We have to leave things to him.

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:25.649
Some things we know will only be corrected by what Jehovah does in the near future.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.810
So with that in mind, let's look at the book of Romans.

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:37.089
If we turn there together to Romans chapter 12, we're not as similar thought to the one

00:06:38.209 --> 00:06:43.250
described in Psalm 37 is also here in Romans chapter 12.

00:06:44.209 --> 00:06:49.170
And let's read together verses 17 through 19.

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:54.529
Return evil for evil to no one.

00:06:55.649 --> 00:06:59.970
Take into consideration what is fine from the viewpoint of all men.

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:07.649
If possible, as far as it depends on you, be peaceable with all men.

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:11.970
Do not avenge yourselves, beloved.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.889
But yield place to the wrath.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:23.649
For it is written, vengeance is mine, I will replay, says Jehovah.

00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:29.250
Now when it says yield place to the wrath, what does that mean?

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:34.529
Well, we know that the watchtowers hope this to see that that's Jehovah's wrath.

00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:43.329
In other words, it's his right to rectify all these bad things that are happening.

00:07:44.209 --> 00:07:51.490
So rather than presumptuously trying to jump in and write the wrong and try to react in a negative

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:57.889
way to all these bad things that are happening around us, some things we realize we have to leave

00:07:57.889 --> 00:08:01.889
to Jehovah and allow him to correct the situation.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:08.850
So that's the first point, strengthen our trust in Jehovah.

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:12.129
Yes, make sure our hope is in him.

00:08:12.129 --> 00:08:18.529
The second point is that we need to actively develop humility.

00:08:18.529 --> 00:08:24.449
Now, lady, if you check the book of Zephaniah chapter 2 and verse 3,

00:08:24.449 --> 00:08:30.769
it mentions there that we need to seek meekness and it mentions meek ones in the earth.

00:08:31.089 --> 00:08:37.250
But the footnote to that verse mentions humility, the humble ones.

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:46.049
So obviously then humility is also connected with having a mild temper and being meek.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:50.289
How so? Well, humility means we respect others.

00:08:51.169 --> 00:08:57.330
And of course included in that is our respective Jehovah, allowing him to do what he needs to do

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.210
rather than us presumptuously stepping in.

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:05.490
And our final thought, we could find in Proverbs chapter 6,

00:09:06.769 --> 00:09:16.210
Proverbs 6, and verses 1 through 3, here it describes a person who is in a difficult situation.

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:22.370
In this case, they've put up a security for their neighbor and now it hasn't worked out well.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.730
But what does it say to do in verse 3?

00:09:26.129 --> 00:09:32.289
Do this my son and free yourself for you have fallen into the hand of your neighbor.

00:09:32.289 --> 00:09:35.970
Now, how should we react in a situation like that?

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:42.769
It says go and humble yourself and urgently plead with your neighbor.

00:09:42.769 --> 00:09:50.370
Now interestingly, the Hebrew expression here humble yourself literally means stamp yourself down.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:57.009
So, do we see the lesson? When we're faced with a test like Moses was faced with,

00:09:57.009 --> 00:10:03.889
what should we do? Stamp ourselves down. Yes, hold off that hot temper.

00:10:03.889 --> 00:10:13.490
Yes, have full trust and hope in Jehovah and in that way we can be sure that he will view us as a meek person.
