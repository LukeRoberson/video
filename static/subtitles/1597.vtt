00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.860
Do you remember the beautiful dramas we had at the regional convention last year?

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.900
One of them was about King Hezekiah.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.939
We saw not only the threat Jehovah's people faced,

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:16.059
but also the protection Jehovah provided.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:22.780
In producing the drama, the audio video services department used a lot of visual effects.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.579
Let's go behind the scenes and find out what the work entailed.

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:41.759
The goal of our visual effects team is to take the work done during film production and expand it.

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:45.000
Our work was driven by the Bible account.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.880
The audience needed to feel the intimidating power of the Assyrian Army while not endangering our actors.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:58.840
And the use of visual effects had the added benefit of drastically saving donated funds.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.039
But this meant creating hundreds of digital arrows,

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:09.359
war machines, cities, tents, soldiers, and even an Assyrian palace.

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:13.480
In some cases, the foreground elements had to be separated from the background,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.239
so digital components could be added.

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:19.879
This was a time-consuming process,

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:24.359
as many foreground elements had to be cut out, frame by frame,

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:28.359
24 times for each second of video.

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:33.000
Our research team ensured the world created was as accurate as possible.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.760
For example, having period-correct materials for the temple,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.719
as well as accurate stone reliefs.

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:44.280
After filming was complete, the research team noted some scenes in the treasury

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.579
were accidentally shot showing priests wearing sandals.

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:55.060
As this was inaccurate, the issue was corrected by generating additional digital treasures

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.049
and placing them in the foreground.

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.049
As we didn't have the luxury of 185,000 extras,

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.209
actors were dressed in ancient costumes and their pictures taken.

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:10.490
We then used these pictures to create digital extras,

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:18.330
using crowd simulating software to place them in the scenes and drive their movements.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.770
The angel shot proved to be one of the most challenging.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.479
The original version didn't have the dramatic feel needed for the scene,

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:32.360
so the entire sequence was recreated to more accurately convey the immense power

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.219
those present must have witnessed.

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:42.300
Finishing this project on schedule had many challenges.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.460
After hearing about just a few of them,

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.099
one industry expert said what we were attempting was impossible.

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.219
What like Hezekiah when hearing negative reports,

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:55.259
we stayed positive and relied on Jehovah.

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:58.460
With his help, the film was completed on time

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.780
and is now a wonderful tool to bring this Bible account to life.
