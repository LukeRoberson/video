00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.500
Special programs, like a branched education,

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.500
are historic events and unforgettable experiences.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.000
While not all of us can attend every special meeting,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.800
more and more of these programs are shared with us

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.500
on JW Broadcasting.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.199
In March of this year, our brothers and sisters

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:26.699
in Brazil were thrilled when 1,130,826 of them gathered

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.609
to receive a precious gift from Jehovah.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.909
In Brazil, with the governing body support,

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:38.509
planning began in 2007 to produce a revised version

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:43.719
of the New World Translation in Brazilian Portuguese.

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.020
Using the English source text and many reference works,

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:54.579
the Portuguese translation team refined the text.

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.479
After seven years of intense and thorough work,

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:05.650
the new Bible was composed and finally ready for printing.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.750
The United States and Japan branches printed almost

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:24.459
1.3 million Bibles and shipped them to Brazil.

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:26.459
Once they arrived at the branch,

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:28.560
it took about three months to forward them

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.159
to the more than 11,000 congregations around Brazil,

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.959
involving a lot of careful planning and organization.

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:38.959
Each box was labeled with specific instructions

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:43.459
that they should not be opened in advance.

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:46.659
The first boxes were sent to the furthest regions

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.159
so that every congregation would have them on hand

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.060
for a special meeting arranged for March 22nd, 2015.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.240
Finally, that special day arrived.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.539
Preparations were made so that all the congregations

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:20.780
in Brazil would be connected.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.979
More than 740,000 attended the event

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:27.280
at a live broadcast meeting and many others

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.280
would watch later on during the day.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:42.930
In some kingdoms, there were up to three sessions.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.729
The audience enjoyed a building talks

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:46.229
and interviews with brothers

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:52.289
that saw the first New World Translation release in 1967.

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:54.490
There was great anticipation in the year.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.189
Brothers' plane was present for the special meeting

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:58.990
and what a joy it was to discover

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.990
that the Bible had been revised

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.189
and was now available in Brazilian Portuguese.

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.979
Everyone present received their own personal copy

00:03:32.979 --> 00:04:01.650
of the new revised Bible.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.849
While the Bible was being distributed,

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.349
those in attendance heard a chorus sing

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:23.699
of the new songs in Portuguese.

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.899
This new Bible will help me to get to know Jehovah

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:29.500
and it will be even better for the use in the field ministry.

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.699
Our brothers and sisters present

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:36.699
were so grateful for what they saw and heard

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:40.589
at this unforgettable meeting.

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:43.089
The illustrations here at the back are very interesting

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:51.139
because it's much easier to understand.

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.639
How wonderful to know that at the end of that special day

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.339
with Jehovah's help

00:04:56.339 --> 00:05:07.620
around 1.1 million Bibles had been distributed.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.920
Few things compared to receiving the New World Translation

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.920
in your own language.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.420
As Jehovah's people, we love studying

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.420
from a clear and accurate translation

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.920
since the Bible is God's way of communicating with us today.
