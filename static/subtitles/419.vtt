00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:09.339
Well, today's text is a partial quote of Hebrews 13.7, why don't we read the entire verse?

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:15.900
And then we'll discuss its importance to those to whom Paul was writing, but also to us

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.899
today.

00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:23.579
As Hebrews 13.7, remember those who are taking the lead among you who have spoken the word

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:34.030
of God to you, and as you contemplate how their conduct turns out, imitate their faith.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.070
Now to whom was Paul writing?

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:44.590
Well, to the Hebrew or Jewish Christians who belonged to the congregation in Jerusalem.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.509
Was it important for them to pay attention to those taking the lead?

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.450
Well, consider.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.509
Paul wrote this around 61 CE.

00:00:55.509 --> 00:01:04.629
So that was about five years before Jerusalem was surrounded by Roman armies and then later destroyed.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:11.230
Now who were taking the lead in the Jerusalem congregation at that time?

00:01:11.269 --> 00:01:22.290
The May 15, 1997 watchtower pages 16 and 17 explains that it appears the governing body,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:33.730
composed of the remaining members of the apostles and older men, were likely very active in Jerusalem right up until 66 CE.

00:01:33.769 --> 00:01:41.769
So surely they would be among those taking the lead to whom Paul referred.

00:01:41.769 --> 00:01:49.730
Now what things could the brothers remember about the faith and the conduct of the apostles and older men?

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:56.209
You know, certainly they could remember the words and the example of the apostle Peter.

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:05.049
Though Peter was arrested and beaten, he, along with the rest of the apostles, told the authorities,

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.849
we must obey God as ruler rather than men.

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:15.129
And Peter remained active for the rest of his life encouraging the brothers.

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:21.009
They could remember the loyalty and the courage of the apostle James,

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:28.210
who hered a grip of the first, put to death by the sword in 44 CE.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:37.969
Remembering the loyalty and the courage of these brothers would have been benefit to the brothers in the congregation,

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:42.050
especially as the end of the Jewish system drew near.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.729
Well now how can we apply Paul's exhortation today?

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:56.090
As a Bachelors comments mentioned, one way to remember and imitate the example of our faithful members of the governing body.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:07.009
And just as members of the Jerusalem congregation, we at Bethel have an extraordinary privilege and a unique opportunity

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:13.250
to see the faith and observe the conduct of our brothers on the governing body.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:23.289
And today by means of J.W. broadcast, our brothers around the world actually see members of the governing body.

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:30.409
They hear them speak the word of God to them and they can observe their conduct.

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:43.090
And also we have the life stories of former members of the governing body who faithfully served Jehovah for decades until they received their heavenly reward.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:51.050
Let's just remember for them and what they told us how their conduct turned out.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.460
The first is TJ Sullivan.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:03.180
Now, brother Sullivan faithfully served on the governing body until his death in 1974.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:14.780
In his life story in the watchtower of August 15, 1965, brother Sullivan related what happened at Madison Square Garden in June 1939.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:22.620
Brother Ruthford was giving a talk when a demon controlled mob tried to break up that meeting.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.139
A number of brothers were falsely arrested.

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:27.740
Listen to his comments.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.259
Brother Ruthford insisted on going to the police station immediately.

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:36.660
I was privileged to drive along with him on that occasion.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:43.939
Driving through from the Madison Square Garden to the police station, we saw demonstrated the mad fury of the mob

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:48.819
and the restraining power of our God to preserve his people.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.300
At the police station, we had to struggle through the mob to get in.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.980
So after assisting the brothers and on leaving the police station, brother Sullivan added.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.220
On our leaving, the same demonic mob was still outside.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.980
They tried to force their way into the car and bar its progress.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:16.579
It was necessary for some of us to ride on the running boards to keep the crowds from tearing the doors open.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.339
What courage, what boldness, brothers, brother and brother and Sullivan display.

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:27.259
Will we need to display such courage in the days ahead?

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:33.660
Well now let's remember brother George Ganges, another former member of the governing body.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:40.100
His life story appeared in the October 15, 1966 watchtower.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.300
Have you ever felt inadequate for assignments you were given?

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:49.459
Brother Ganges related what happened when he gave his first six minute talk.

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:55.420
He was gripped with fear and could hardly finish, but he never quit.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.459
He also said a wonderful example in his love for the meetings.

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:08.540
He prayed to God to not permit him to miss any meetings and for 45 years up to that point he had not.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:17.459
He said to me meeting with the brothers is one of life's greatest pleasures and a source of encouragement.

00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:24.180
I love to be at the kingdom hall among the first and leave among the last if possible.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.339
I feel an inward joy when talking with God's people.

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:35.899
When I am among them, I feel at home with my family in a spiritual paradise.

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:43.540
Brother Ganges finishes a earthly course in 1994 at 98 years old.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:48.220
Next we remember brother Carl Klein.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:54.019
He related on one occasion brother Rutherford gave him a blunt reproof.

00:06:54.019 --> 00:07:01.300
The next time he saw Carl, he cheerily said hello Carl, but because of still feeling hurt,

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.100
Carl just muttered a greeting.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:09.540
Brother Rutherford continued, Carl, watch out, the devil's after you.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:17.180
Embarrassed, he replied, oh, there's nothing brother Rutherford, but he knew better and repeated his warning.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:22.259
That's all right, just watch out, the devil's after you.

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:28.220
He asked we should remember these words of brother Klein because they're Bible-based.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:33.899
Never do we want to allow place for the devil by harboring resentment.

00:07:33.899 --> 00:07:40.819
In January 2001 at the age of 95, Carl Klein faithfully completed his earthly course.

00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:44.339
Next we remember brother Dan Sidleck.

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:49.980
Brother Sidleck's life story appeared in the June 1, 1985 watchtower.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:55.819
We were always encouraged when brother Sidleck would start his morning worship

00:07:55.819 --> 00:08:02.459
with a hearty, it's good to be alive to serve the true and living God, Jehovah.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:10.420
A story reveals why brother Sidleck loved life, loved God's people, loved Jehovah.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:18.019
He wrote, throughout life's experiences, there has been the ever-sustaining power of God's friendship.

00:08:18.019 --> 00:08:28.620
He added, even at this moment, share joy overwhelms me when I read the Psalmist words in Psalm 33,

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:37.179
happy the nation that has Jehovah for its God, the people that he chose as his estate,

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:44.419
that your friendship be over us, Jehovah, as we rest our expectations on you.

00:08:44.419 --> 00:08:53.860
Brother Sidleck finished his earthly course in April 2006 after having served at Bethel for nearly 60 years.

00:08:53.899 --> 00:09:00.299
Yes, brothers, we do well to remember both the current and former members of the governing body.

00:09:00.299 --> 00:09:10.659
As was the case with the Jewish Christians to whom Paul wrote, we too are approaching the end of a system of things.

00:09:10.659 --> 00:09:17.139
And so we need to imitate the faith of our brothers who take the lead among us,

00:09:17.139 --> 00:09:22.620
and that will help us endure to the end, whether that end is the end of our life now,

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.220
or the end of this wicked system of things.
