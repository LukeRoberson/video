00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:04.679
Welcome, brothers and sisters.

00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:10.679
In this program, we're going to discuss the joy of in-person conventions.

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.679
But first, here are a few updates.

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.679
After nearly 20 years, on April 26, 2023,

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:26.679
the government of Spain approved a historic adjustment to the country's tax exemption law.

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:34.679
This decision confirms that Jehovah's Witnesses are a well-known and respected religion in Spain.

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:42.679
In addition, the adjustment exempts our brothers from having to pay property tax on theocratic facilities in the country.

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:50.679
It also allows individuals in Spain who support the work to obtain a tax deduction on their contributions.

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:54.679
We're very grateful for this positive development.

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:02.679
Also, as reported on JW.org, we're very pleased that on May 16, 2023,

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:10.680
Brother Shamil Hakimoff was released from prison in Tajikistan after fulfilling his prison sentence.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.680
You might recall that he was first detained in February 2019.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.680
He spent over four years in prison for his faith.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:27.680
He plans to get some much-needed rest and is being helped to receive necessary medical care.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.680
We're very happy for you, Brother Hakimoff.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.680
Your faithful endurance encourages all of us.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:45.680
Of course, we continue to keep close in mind the over 180 brothers and sisters who are still imprisoned for their faith.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.680
The Apostle Paul wrote at Philippians 1 verse 14.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.680
Now, most of the brothers in the Lord have gained confidence because of my prison bonds,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.680
and they are showing all the more courage to speak the Word of God fearlessly.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.680
Just as first-century Christians were encouraged by Paul's faithful example,

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:16.680
the faith of those imprisoned in our day impels us to share the kingdom good news with Zeal.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.680
But can such faithful ones in prison be sure of Jehovah's blessing and protection?

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.680
Isaiah's prophecy highlights what Jehovah promised for his cleansed people.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.680
Note Isaiah chapter 4 verses 5 and 6.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.060
It says,

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:44.060
Jehovah will also create over the whole side of Mount Zion and over the place of her conventions,

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.060
a cloud and smoke by day, and a bright flaming fire by night.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:56.060
For over all the glory there will be a shelter, and there will be a booth for shade by day from the heat,

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.060
and for refuge and protection from storms and the rain.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.060
These verses highlight the spiritual protection that Jehovah offered his servants in the past,

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.060
and by extension to us today.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.060
How so?

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:20.060
Verse 5 says that Jehovah will create over his people a cloud, smoke, and a bright flaming fire.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.060
These remind us of how Jehovah cared for the Israelites after they left Egypt.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.060
He used a pillar of fire and cloud to protect and to lead them.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.060
No, Jehovah doesn't promise us miraculous physical protection.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:42.060
Nor does he prevent the heat of persecution or storms of opposition from bearing down on us.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.060
But as verse 6 explains,

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.060
He does protect us spiritually,

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.060
as if building a booth for shade and for protection from the rainstorm.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.060
What's the point?

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.060
Jehovah promises to be with his faithful servants wherever they are.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.060
Even if they're boxed in by four prison walls,

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.060
Jehovah is our protector.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.060
His Holy Spirit gives us joy and peace.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.060
No human can tear down the booth of protection that Jehovah builds.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.060
As long as we maintain our integrity, our future is secure.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:30.060
Did you notice another place where Jehovah's Cloud of Spiritual Protection is?

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:36.060
Verse 5 says it would be over the place of his servants' conventions.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:42.060
We're very excited that it's convention season once again, this time in person.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:48.060
We're eager to share in the invitation campaign and thrilled to be together in person for conventions

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.060
for the first time since 2019.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.060
Just last week, my wife and I received a letter from a sister

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:02.060
who will soon be attending the regional convention and the Pioneer Service School.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.060
She wrote,

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.060
I usually wait to write to you until after the events.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.060
But this year I did not want to delay and letting you know how happy,

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:18.060
how excited, how spiritually blessed I know we will be after each of these special occasions.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.060
How do I know it will be perfect?

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.060
Just what we need at each event?

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.060
Because of the track record.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.060
Jehovah's Hand is not short.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.060
Not once have we been disappointed or thinking,

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.060
I wish for something else.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.060
Thank you.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.060
What an expression of faith.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.060
This certainly is pleasing to our Heavenly Father, Jehovah,

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.750
and to His Son, the head of the Christian congregation.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.750
Over the years, convention arrangements have been simplified

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.750
so that we can focus more on the spiritual program.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.750
For example, do you recall when meals were served at our conventions?

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.750
Arrangements varied globally,

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:14.740
but no doubt you'll enjoy this brief report on how things were done over the years in the United States.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.740
In the United States, providing meals for fellow convention attendees

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.740
extends all the way back to the 1890s.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.740
However, the sheer magnitude of the task took on new dimensions in the 1940s

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.740
when the size of conventions grew.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.740
Many volunteers were needed to procure, receive, prepare,

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.740
and serve three hot meals a day to delegates.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:43.819
An example of this was the eight-day New World Society Assembly of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:47.819
held in Yankee Stadium in 1953.

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:52.819
Some 130,000 attended on average each day.

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:57.819
The cafeteria was operated by 4,500 volunteers

00:06:57.819 --> 00:07:01.819
with a capacity to provide 30,000 meals per hour.

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:06.819
Although food service volunteers were happy to work in behalf of convention attendees,

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:10.819
they often worked many hours and heard very little or none of the program

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:14.819
and often had to attend a second convention to listen.

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:19.819
So in 1978, food service operations were simplified in many places.

00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:24.819
Instead of a cafeteria meal, refreshments stands were used and featured a simplified menu.

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:28.819
This made it possible for the vast majority of food service volunteers

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:30.819
to hear the spiritual program.

00:07:30.819 --> 00:07:35.819
Further simplifications were made in 1987 when hot food items were no longer provided,

00:07:35.819 --> 00:07:40.819
thus eliminating the need for natural gas, oven trailers, and the like.

00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:46.819
For decades, meal tickets were available for purchase and were exchanged for food items.

00:07:46.819 --> 00:07:49.819
These tickets were designed so that no change was needed,

00:07:49.819 --> 00:07:51.819
thus expediting the purchase of food.

00:07:51.819 --> 00:07:55.740
Here's a sample menu.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.740
The menu showed how many tickets were required to purchase each item.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:06.740
Finally, in 1995, arrangements for food service at conventions were discontinued.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.740
Instead, delegates were encouraged to bring their own food

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:14.740
and enjoy association on location during the noon break.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.740
As a result, we no longer need to wait in line.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.740
We have more time to spend with friends on site

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:24.740
and this arrangement is easier for our older and infirm ones.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:32.259
We continue to benefit from this simplified arrangement today.

00:08:32.259 --> 00:08:35.259
So in order to enjoy association during the noon break,

00:08:35.259 --> 00:08:39.259
we encourage everyone to bring a light lunch,

00:08:39.259 --> 00:08:43.259
which will also help us to stay awake during the afternoon session.

00:08:43.259 --> 00:08:47.659
As we return to in-person conventions,

00:08:47.659 --> 00:08:50.659
perhaps we'll feel like those from Eastern Europe

00:08:50.659 --> 00:08:55.659
who attended international conventions in Poland in 1989.

00:08:55.659 --> 00:08:59.659
That was the first convention ever for most of those delegates,

00:08:59.659 --> 00:09:04.659
although many had been in the truth for 30 years or more.

00:09:04.659 --> 00:09:07.659
One delegate from the former Soviet Union said,

00:09:07.659 --> 00:09:13.299
for many years, we have been waiting for this day.

00:09:13.299 --> 00:09:18.299
And now we are here at this international convention.

00:09:18.299 --> 00:09:21.299
We find it difficult to grasp all of this

00:09:21.299 --> 00:09:25.299
and take it all in. It is like a dream.

00:09:25.299 --> 00:09:30.299
It is impossible to express in words everything we have seen and heard.

00:09:30.299 --> 00:09:34.299
When we saw the gigantic bowl-shaped stadium full of people

00:09:34.299 --> 00:09:39.299
and heard the music, our eyes filled with tears.

00:09:39.299 --> 00:09:45.299
And the prayer, while all of us were motionlessly united,

00:09:45.299 --> 00:09:48.299
it sent cold shivers down our backs.

00:09:48.299 --> 00:09:52.299
It was so solemn and unanimous.

00:09:52.299 --> 00:09:56.299
This convention in Warsaw is such a splendid and grand event

00:09:56.299 --> 00:09:59.299
that only the new world will be better.

00:09:59.299 --> 00:10:01.299
We will always remember these wonderful days.

00:10:01.299 --> 00:10:04.299
It is something one cannot forget.

00:10:04.299 --> 00:10:10.299
Special thanks and glory be to our creator, Jehovah God.

00:10:10.299 --> 00:10:15.299
The wake of December 22, 1989 reported,

00:10:16.299 --> 00:10:19.299
the singing at the conventions was noteworthy

00:10:19.299 --> 00:10:23.299
as tens of thousands sang in unison in over 20 different languages,

00:10:23.299 --> 00:10:29.299
all expressing the same thoughts in a spirit of love and unity.

00:10:31.409 --> 00:10:33.409
As mentioned in the May broadcast,

00:10:33.409 --> 00:10:37.409
we encourage you to learn the new original song,

00:10:37.409 --> 00:10:40.409
it will not be late.

00:10:40.409 --> 00:10:44.409
During the pandemic, we missed singing at large conventions.

00:10:45.409 --> 00:10:48.409
This year, to quote Psalm 7, verse 17,

00:10:48.409 --> 00:10:52.409
will again sing praises to the name of Jehovah the Most High

00:10:52.409 --> 00:10:55.409
at our conventions.

00:10:55.409 --> 00:10:58.409
I still remember attending conventions in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

00:10:58.409 --> 00:11:00.409
when I was a kid.

00:11:00.409 --> 00:11:03.409
It was thrilling to hear Kingdom Melodies echoing

00:11:03.409 --> 00:11:08.409
in a large stadium that had been converted into a house of worship.

00:11:08.409 --> 00:11:40.029
Many of you will remember this stirring Kingdom Melody from 1981.

00:11:40.029 --> 00:11:43.029
Do you have similar memories?

00:11:43.029 --> 00:11:46.029
If you were baptized during the pandemic,

00:11:46.029 --> 00:11:51.029
then this year's convention will likely be your first in person.

00:11:51.029 --> 00:11:56.029
You too will form memories that will last a lifetime.

00:11:56.029 --> 00:11:58.029
That's how many of our brothers and sisters felt

00:11:58.029 --> 00:12:02.029
when they recently attended the exercise patience convention.

00:12:02.029 --> 00:12:13.980
We're here at the Newburg, New York,

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.980
exercise patience convention.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.980
This is my first convention as a baptized witness.

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.980
It's a joy to be with our family today

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.980
and get the spiritual food that we need.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.980
It's clear that Jehovah's people haven't forgotten how to laugh

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.980
and hug each other, love each other.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.980
Being in person, being able to really share everybody singing together,

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.980
talking with everybody in person, you can't beat it.

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.980
The singing is beautiful.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.980
When we were doing it on the Zoom, you don't hear the voices,

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:45.980
so to see all the voices singing together, the harmony,

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:48.980
it's just you feel it more.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:51.980
The theme exercise patience, it's a great theme

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:55.980
because that's something that we don't have today in this world.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:59.980
It seems like what's presented matches exactly what we're dealing with in our lives

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.980
and what we see happening in the world.

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:03.980
It's phenomenal the way that you could follow along

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:07.980
and how it makes the Bible so much easier to understand.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:10.980
All the videos and meeting new friends

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.980
and seeing even my old friends that I haven't seen in a while.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.980
I love that you can sit and have a meal with someone you've never met before

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.980
and you have something in common, you can talk about the program

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:23.980
and by the end of the meal, you've become great friends.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:29.980
To get our family ready for a convention is a lot of work.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:33.980
It has a mom, but conventions draw us closer as families

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.980
because we're all worshiping Jehovah together.

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:41.980
For someone that's never been to a convention before,

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.980
I tell them that the experience is going to change their life.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:47.980
They're going to see and feel a different type of love

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.980
that they've probably never felt before.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:54.980
Now being here together and seeing them in person, it's a different field.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:58.980
It's so beautiful. You get together with so many people, so loving.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:04.519
It's almost like a taste of the paradise right here right now.

00:14:04.519 --> 00:14:09.519
You are going to love this year's convention.

00:14:09.519 --> 00:14:12.519
Did any of the photos in our update make you think about

00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:17.519
special conventions? When are the next ones planned?

00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:21.519
We're pleased to inform you that 15 special conventions

00:14:21.519 --> 00:14:26.519
in countries around the world are being planned for 2024.

00:14:26.519 --> 00:14:31.899
The locations and dates will be announced in the coming months.

00:14:31.899 --> 00:14:34.899
So what have we discussed in this update?

00:14:34.899 --> 00:14:39.899
We're reminded that Jehovah is our protector.

00:14:39.899 --> 00:14:42.899
But this doesn't mean that we'll have a problem-free life

00:14:42.899 --> 00:14:44.899
in this system of things.

00:14:44.899 --> 00:14:51.899
However, when we face challenges, we know that Jehovah is with us.

00:14:51.899 --> 00:14:56.899
He protects us spiritually and provides the power beyond what is normal

00:14:56.899 --> 00:15:00.899
so we can endure trials faithfully.

00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:05.899
And we're very excited for our exercise patience, regional conventions.

00:15:06.899 --> 00:15:09.899
May Jehovah bless the invitation campaign

00:15:09.899 --> 00:15:13.899
and your efforts to attend all three days in person.

00:15:13.899 --> 00:15:20.690
As Paul wrote to Timothy in his first letter, chapter 1, verse 2,

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:25.690
may you have undeserved kindness and mercy and peace

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:29.690
from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:33.690
We love you all very much.

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:38.690
From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
