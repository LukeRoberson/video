WEBVTT

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:07.780
One of the tools that can help us to actively search out reminders is JW Library.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:14.779
This amazing app has been installed on over 15 million devices.

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:19.780
But do you know how much work it takes to develop and maintain this app?

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.780
Well, we are now going to look behind the scenes and meet some of the brothers

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.780
who have either worked on this project or helped to organize that work.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:37.780
This really is an opportunity to visit an area in Bethel that you don't get to see on tour.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.780
Of course, there are many brothers associated with the work.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.780
But we would like you to get to know three of these very hard working brothers

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.780
and let me introduce them to you.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.780
First of all, brother Pierre Christensen, the overseer of MEPS programming.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.780
Now Pierre, you've been in this country working in the US Bethel for a number of years.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.780
But where are you from originally?

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.780
I was born in Denmark and served there in the brains for years.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.780
So when did you and your wife bear it come to the United States?

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.780
In 1994.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.780
And our first year was in Brooklyn.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.780
And then we had 18 years in Patterson and then back to Brooklyn again for three and a half year.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.780
And now we're in Warwick since November last year.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.780
Well, I know you worked in translation services for a while because in fact,

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.780
the two of us worked together in the same department there for a while.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.780
But what type of work have you been involved with since you've come to the United States?

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.780
Lots of exciting and challenging jobs and working in translation services.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.780
That was training and support for our translators worldwide.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.780
Now in MEPS programming, that is all about distribution of spiritual food

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.780
to all our brothers and sisters.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.780
So we have a ton of work and a lot of challenges.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.780
But I'm also working with a lot of very, very talented brothers and sisters.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.780
So it's a lot of fun and it's great going to work every day.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.780
That's great, Pierre.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.780
In fact, I'm even tempted to come back and work with you.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.780
Oh, we would love that.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.780
I think I'd love it, too.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.780
Well, let's turn our attention to Brother Alfredo's son.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.780
You're the assistant officer of MEPS programming.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.780
In fact, you and I worked together in Mexico back in 2003.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.780
Could you tell us a little bit about what you were doing at that time?

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.780
My last work assignment involved overseeing the large translation department there.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.780
It was an amazing privilege to work with translators in sign language

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.780
and the indigenous languages.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.780
A true joy to contribute to preparing publications for those in the minority groups.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.780
So when did you and your wife Gina come to the United States to work here?

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.780
We arrived at Patterson in 2007.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.780
We have fond memories of that time and it's something we still treasure.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.780
Very good. And now Brother Paul Willis,

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.780
where do you originally come from along with your wife, Selin?

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.780
And when did you come to the United States?

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.780
Well, we're both originally from South Africa.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.780
And we served there in Bethel for a number of years.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.780
And then in 2010, we were transferred to work along with MEPS programming here in the US.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.780
So what type of work have you been involved with, particularly recently?

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.780
Well, most of my time at Bethel, I've been working on the Watchtower translation system or WTS.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.780
Actually, I was working along with Pierre. Pierre was in headquarters

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.780
and I was working on the programming team that we had in South Africa.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.780
WTS is the program that the translators use to help organize and manage their translation work.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.780
And then, of course, most recently, I've been working on the mobile apps, the JW Library App

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.780
and the JW Library Sign Language App.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.780
Very good. Well, now all of you work in MEPS programming.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.780
Pierre, can you just tell us a little bit? We're familiar with the term MEPS, but what really is it?

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.780
Well, MEPS stands for multi-language electronic publishing system.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.780
That didn't help me at all.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.780
Can you make it a little bit more simpler so we can understand?

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:15.780
Can we make the tools or the programs that the organization needs to make publications

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.779
and have them translated into hundreds of languages?

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:25.779
So I can illustrate it this way that we are not making the spiritual food,

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:29.779
but we are building a conveyor belt for the spiritual food

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:33.779
from the faithful and discreet slave and down to the printing presses

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:40.779
or to our website or to what's our library, online library, or like in this case, JW Library.

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:45.779
Thanks so much. Now, along last I do understand a bit more about what MEPS means.

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:52.779
Now, as I travel around, the brothers and sisters, they tell me how much they love JW Library,

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:58.779
but there seems to be no end to the suggestions for improvements, features,

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:04.779
long list of suggestions. Can you give us a little bit of an idea of what's involved

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:08.779
with trying to develop a new feature with JW Library?

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:12.779
Yes, the brothers and the sisters really love using the app.

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:15.779
And because of that, they're keen to get many new features.

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:19.779
Of course, we wish we could just add all those new features into the app,

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:22.779
but the truth is, we just can't.

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:26.779
Yes, adding each new feature involves a lot of work.

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:30.779
And we also need to determine whether a feature that's requested,

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:32.779
is that just a nice to have?

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:35.779
Or is it something that's going to address a real need?

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:38.779
For example, will it really help an elder who's out on a shepherding call?

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:44.779
Or maybe a pioneer sister who's at the public witnessing cards or at a Bible study or a turn visit?

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:51.779
Also, very important to us is trying to make each new feature very simple to use.

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:53.779
Thanks for doing that.

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:57.779
Especially for a first-time user, someone who's never used the app before.

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:01.779
And then, of course, before we start working on anything, we always get approval from the governing body.

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:03.779
That's a good thing to do, too.

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:10.779
One feature that many have been asking for is the ability to add notes into the app.

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:16.779
And of course, before we start programming it, we have to make sure that it actually does what is wanted.

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:19.779
We made a video that shows how we go on that.

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:20.779
Would you like to see it?

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:22.779
Well, of course, I'd love to see it.

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:24.779
Hello.

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:25.779
How are you?

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:26.779
Good, good, good.

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:27.779
Thanks for coming.

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:29.779
Fine, thank you. Have a seat.

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:31.779
All right, so glad you could be here.

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:32.779
Thank you so much.

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:33.779
It was all fancy.

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:36.779
Yeah, so we get to talk about JW Library today.

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:39.779
So what are some ways that you use JW Library?

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:42.779
I mean, it's a revolution that is going to meetings.

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:43.779
Oh, wow.

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:45.779
I go to meetings sometimes and I just carry my iPad.

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:47.779
So the fact that you can make this text larger?

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:49.779
It's easy to listen to the reading.

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:50.779
Right in the app now.

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:52.779
It's why I find myself doing that.

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:56.779
So if we were to make a notes feature, what are some things that you'd like to be able to do?

00:06:56.779 --> 00:07:00.779
I mean, if you could see all your notes without tapping on each one, that would be great.

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:07.779
And even if you make a note in maybe your phone, and that it can also be saved in your tablet, that would be really nice.

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:08.779
Yes.

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:15.779
Well, what if I told you that in front of you is an early version of JW Library?

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:17.779
This is it?

00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:18.779
With notes.

00:07:18.779 --> 00:07:19.779
Yeah.

00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:25.779
So a few months ago, the governing body gave us approval to start working on the notes feature.

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:29.779
We got together as a team and we'll do like these rough sketches and the programmers write code.

00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:32.779
But before we release an update, we have a group of testers.

00:07:32.779 --> 00:07:36.779
You know, they'll find little glitches or bugs or things, but they'll try to work it out with the programmers.

00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:40.779
After that, we have a pretty stable version of JW Library.

00:07:40.779 --> 00:07:44.779
The goal is to show it to you, and you can let us know what you think.

00:07:45.779 --> 00:07:49.779
So now that you've seen the new notes feature in JW Library, what do you think?

00:07:49.779 --> 00:07:56.779
I'd love that I can tag the personal things that I need to work on or a common or a scripture that I can encourage someone with.

00:07:56.779 --> 00:07:57.779
This is fantastic.

00:07:57.779 --> 00:07:58.779
Yeah, that's great.

00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:02.779
I like that I can find my notes, especially using the search feature.

00:08:02.779 --> 00:08:03.779
Yeah, that's great.

00:08:03.779 --> 00:08:09.779
And it's really neat how my comments, I can place it right next to the paragraph for meetings, and it doesn't cover the actual text.

00:08:09.779 --> 00:08:10.779
Yeah.

00:08:10.779 --> 00:08:15.779
The ability to back it up so you can restore it to another device that's going to be really helpful.

00:08:15.779 --> 00:08:16.779
I love it.

00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:17.779
Amazing.

00:08:17.779 --> 00:08:18.779
Okay, go ahead.

00:08:22.779 --> 00:08:29.779
That's fantastic, but brothers, you can't show us something like that and not tell us when we're going to get it.

00:08:29.779 --> 00:08:31.779
Well, we said on the website it was coming soon.

00:08:31.779 --> 00:08:34.779
I know you said that on the website, but when?

00:08:34.779 --> 00:08:36.779
Is it okay to be more specific than that?

00:08:36.779 --> 00:08:38.779
I think that's why they invited us here.

00:08:38.779 --> 00:08:39.779
Paul, let's hear it.

00:08:39.779 --> 00:08:44.779
Well, we're happy to tell you that the notes feature in JW Library will be coming soon.

00:08:44.779 --> 00:08:49.779
And by soon, we mean during May of 2017 this month.

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:52.779
So we can go and check the app stores for an update.

00:08:52.779 --> 00:08:54.779
Oh, that's wonderful to hear.

00:08:54.779 --> 00:09:00.779
So all of us will be happy to be able to put our own reminders right there in the JW Library app.

00:09:00.779 --> 00:09:04.779
Well, that's, I'm looking forward to being able to do that as well.

00:09:04.779 --> 00:09:10.779
But now, while I've got you here, we're not going to let you go until we ask this big question.

00:09:10.779 --> 00:09:12.779
What are you working on now?

00:09:12.779 --> 00:09:17.779
In other words, what can we expect to see soon with JW Library?

00:09:17.779 --> 00:09:24.779
We have another brief video showing what the team is working on to support the study Bible on JW Library app.

00:09:24.779 --> 00:09:25.779
Would you like to see it?

00:09:25.779 --> 00:09:29.179
That's wonderful. Let's have a look.

00:09:29.179 --> 00:09:36.179
Later this year, work will begin on adding the study edition of the New World Translation to JW Library.

00:09:36.179 --> 00:09:42.179
When this edition becomes available in your language, you will be able to discover spiritual gems in the study notes.

00:09:42.179 --> 00:09:49.179
And the new media gallery will help you to visualize the people, places, and things you read about.

00:09:49.179 --> 00:09:56.179
You will also see the new overviews of each book play the introductory videos and study additional appendix material.

00:09:56.179 --> 00:10:01.179
All of this and more is coming soon to JW Library.

00:10:01.179 --> 00:10:04.179
That sounds so exciting.

00:10:04.179 --> 00:10:09.179
So we'll look forward to getting that feature. You said coming soon, didn't you?

00:10:09.179 --> 00:10:21.179
Anyway, we'd like to thank you very much for the fact that you've come along and you've explained so much to us about what goes on with MEPs programming and the JW Library app.

00:10:21.179 --> 00:10:35.179
But before you go, we'd like to ask you, when you go back to your department, please take an expression of our appreciation back to the hardworking brothers and sisters who are working behind the scenes and providing this tool for us.

00:10:35.179 --> 00:10:36.179
Thank you.

00:10:36.179 --> 00:10:37.179
Thank you very much.
