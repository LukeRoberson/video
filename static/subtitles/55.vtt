WEBVTT

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:09.939
We extend a warm welcome to all and are happy that you've joined us for the December 2018 program of JW Broadcasting.

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:40.659
During this program, you'll enjoy exciting and upbuilding scriptural talks delivered to the students and other attendees during the Gilead graduation held on September 8, 2018.

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:42.659
And this is just the opener.

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:48.659
Parts two and three of the Gilead graduation program will be released in the upcoming weeks.

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:58.659
In addition to motivating Bible talks, you'll get to know some of the students later this month when you watch another edition of the Inside Story.

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:05.659
But now, please enjoy part one of the graduation of the 145th Class of Gilead.

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:13.659
Well, what an exciting time this is to be here for the graduation of the 145th Class of Gilead.

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.659
Let's start by asking a question.

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:30.659
What makes a graduation program of Gilead different from the various graduation programs that people engage in right throughout the earth?

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:37.659
Well, I'm sure all of us would agree usually with regard to worldly institutions.

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.659
Graduation programs are all about the accomplishments and praise of individuals.

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:53.659
But as you dear students realize, the Gilead program, the training that you've received is all about glorifying Jehovah.

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:02.659
And that's why the theme of introductory comments are always seek Jehovah's glory and not your own glory.

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.659
And that's in harmony with what the scriptures tell us.

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:11.659
If you'd like to turn with me please to the book of Romans, Romans chapter 12.

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:16.659
And notice what verse 3 and 16 reminds us.

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.659
Romans 12, verse 3.

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:28.659
For through the underserved kindness given to me, I tell everyone there among you not to think more of himself than is necessary to think.

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:35.659
But to think so as to have a sound mind, each one has God has given to him a measure of faith.

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:41.659
Notice the point there, whatever we have has been given to us by Jehovah.

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.659
So we shouldn't think more of ourselves than is necessary.

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:51.659
And then verse 16, it reminds us, have the same attitude toward others as toward yourselves.

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:57.659
Do not set your mind on lofty things but be let along with the lowly things.

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:01.659
Do not become wise in your own eyes.

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:11.659
Now we trust that you fully understand that admonition because your Gilead training has been helping you to strengthen your relationship with Jehovah.

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:18.659
And when we know Jehovah, we can't help but glorify him because we know any good things we have come from him.

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:35.659
But now as you graduate and you go either back to your former assignments or to new assignments, you may find various tests to this resolve that you have to always glorify Jehovah and not yourself.

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:37.659
Now what might be some of those tests?

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:40.659
Well, one is perhaps an obvious test.

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:46.659
Maybe you go back, maybe to your former assignment and the brother said, oh, you've changed.

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.659
You're so much better.

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:57.289
Well, that's humbling in itself, isn't it? You didn't realize how bad you were before you left.

00:03:57.289 --> 00:04:03.289
And your knowledge, the illustration is the way your teaching seems so much better.

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:08.289
So now what's your reaction? Well, I'm sure you're not going to say, you're welcome.

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:11.289
I noticed that too.

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:21.290
I know and I'm sure all of us know that you'll be determined in a situation like that to bring glory to Jehovah and not to yourselves.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:27.290
So perhaps that's the easy time because as obvious, we have to be careful.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:36.290
But when is the other occasional situation where we may be tempted to show a measure of pride and glorify ourselves?

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:49.290
Well, it could be if people criticize us or perhaps don't show us the respect that we feel that we deserve or maybe we don't get the privileges that we hope to receive.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:05:00.290
Now, that could be a temptation for us to remind everyone of the special training and the fact that you graduated from that training.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:07.290
You see, this is similar to the trap that Job fell into.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:14.290
Now, when we think of Job, we think of a very faithful man, a man of integrity.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.290
The two words go together. Job and integrity.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.290
But we also realize that Job needed to have very strong counsel.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:30.290
Now, at what point in his life did he do something that warranted him getting counsel?

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.290
Well, let's think about it.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.290
We won't read the verses because you know them well.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.290
But in chapter 1, remember, Job lost everything.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.290
His children, his possessions, one after the other.

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:51.290
But when we look at Job chapter 1 verse 22, it tells us there that Job didn't sin.

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.290
He didn't accuse God of doing anything wrong.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.290
So all these horrific things happened to him.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:02.290
He had these huge tests and he came out looking pretty good.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.290
He hadn't sinned at that point.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.290
So then what happened in the second round?

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:12.290
Well, you remember, he had this loathsome disease and then his wife said to him,

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.290
he had been cursed God and died.

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.290
So now, is that when he deserved some counsel?

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:25.290
No. In chapter 2 of Job, in verse 10, it tells us he didn't sin with his lips.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:29.290
So at that point, he was winning, we might say.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.290
He had proved himself an integrity keeper.

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:40.290
So when was it that he started to make a few mistakes that resulted in getting that strong counsel?

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.290
Back in 1980, it tells us.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:48.290
It said it was when these three so-called friends started to criticize him and say,

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.290
maybe you did this, maybe you did that.

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.290
That's the reason.

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:58.290
Then the watchtower said, because of these false accusations,

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:06.290
it's as if it pushed Job over the edge and he vigorously determined to justify himself.

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:11.290
Even though that inferred that maybe Job wasn't treating him correctly.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:15.290
So do we see this is a situation where if we criticize,

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:18.290
though some false accusations are made about us,

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.290
there are over suddenly self-justification can come in.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:30.290
And what is self-justification, glorifying ourselves rather than glorifying Job.

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:34.290
Of course, our Lord Jesus Christ is an excellent example in that regard.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:41.290
Let's have a look at the record recorded in John chapter 8.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:45.290
John chapter 8, verses 48 through 50.

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:52.290
Now here we have a group of Jewish persons criticizing Jesus, falsely accusing him of something.

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:54.290
Notice there in verse 48.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:58.290
In answer, the Jews said to him, that is, to Jesus,

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:02.290
now we're not right in saying, you are a Samaritan.

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:05.290
Now you remember, that's not a compliment.

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:06.290
And you have a demon.

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:09.290
And another occasion, he said, you're out of your mind.

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.290
But now what did Jesus do?

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:16.290
Did he fall into the trap that Job fell into and tried to justify himself?

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:19.290
No, he just made a simple comment.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:25.290
In verse 49, I do not have a demon, but I honor my father and you dishonor me.

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:30.290
Then he says, but I am not seeking glory for myself.

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:34.289
There is one who is seeking and judging.

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:37.289
We see the excellent example of our Lord Jesus.

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:45.289
At that difficult situation where he was falsely accused, he still focused on glorifying Jehovah.

00:08:45.289 --> 00:08:51.289
So what's the lesson, therefore, each one of us, not only yourselves, but all of us?

00:08:51.289 --> 00:08:58.289
Well, you don't need to remind other people that you graduated a Gilead.

00:08:58.289 --> 00:09:04.289
You don't need to try to impress others to get their respect.

00:09:04.289 --> 00:09:07.289
And you don't need to praise yourself.

00:09:07.289 --> 00:09:10.289
What should be the goal of all of us?

00:09:10.289 --> 00:09:17.289
Well, our final scripture we want to share with you is, are the words of Jesus as recorded in Matthew.

00:09:17.289 --> 00:09:21.289
Matthew chapter 5 and verse 16.

00:09:21.289 --> 00:09:29.289
Likewise, let your light shine before men so that they may see your fine works

00:09:29.289 --> 00:09:34.289
and give glory to your father who is in the heavens.

00:09:34.289 --> 00:09:36.289
What a beautiful goal.

00:09:36.289 --> 00:09:43.289
Yes, the goal is that we don't glorify ourselves, but we give all the glory to Jehovah God.

00:09:43.289 --> 00:09:47.289
So with that in mind, we're going to look forward to our wonderful program.

00:09:47.289 --> 00:09:55.289
We've got a number of brothers who put a lot of effort in thinking about what they would like to convey to you before you go to your assignments.

00:09:55.289 --> 00:09:58.289
And the first of these brothers is brother John Echron.

00:09:58.289 --> 00:10:05.289
The theme that he's selected is, what will you do in the year of drought?

00:10:05.289 --> 00:10:23.169
You students are really like beautiful trees planted along the River Gilead.

00:10:23.169 --> 00:10:28.169
Jeremiah chapter 17 and verse 8 describes such beautiful trees.

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:29.169
Let's read that together.

00:10:29.169 --> 00:10:32.169
Jeremiah chapter 17 and verse 8.

00:10:32.169 --> 00:10:39.169
It says, he will become like a tree planted by the waters that sends out its roots to the stream.

00:10:39.169 --> 00:10:44.169
He will not notice when he comes, but his leaves will always flourish.

00:10:44.169 --> 00:10:52.169
And in the year of drought, he will not be anxious, nor will he quit producing fruit.

00:10:53.169 --> 00:10:58.169
Well, you've enjoyed the spiritual waters taught here at Gilead.

00:10:58.169 --> 00:11:09.169
And as you graduate today and you go off to your assignments, your leaves are flourishing and you're producing fruit, figuratively speaking.

00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:15.169
Now, did you notice, though, in verse 8, what the righteous trees had to deal with?

00:11:16.169 --> 00:11:22.169
It says, when the heat comes and in the year of drought.

00:11:22.169 --> 00:11:27.169
Now, it doesn't say not if the heat comes, but when the heat comes.

00:11:27.169 --> 00:11:31.169
So, what is that heat and the year of drought?

00:11:31.169 --> 00:11:34.169
Well, there are many forms of heat we deal with.

00:11:34.169 --> 00:11:42.169
In addition to what you considered about this verse in class, I'd like to focus on one particular form of heat.

00:11:43.169 --> 00:11:46.169
And that is persecution.

00:11:46.169 --> 00:11:53.169
Restrictions on our work and bands are designed to create fear.

00:11:53.169 --> 00:12:00.169
Negative articles in the media about Jehovah's Witnesses are designed to create doubt.

00:12:00.169 --> 00:12:14.169
Religious leaders and opposers, they attack our neutrality, our clear support for the Bible's view of sex and marriage, or discipline by dispeloshipping and other matters.

00:12:14.169 --> 00:12:23.169
And add to that that some of our brothers are being rounded up and thrown into prison, we can say that Satan has truly turned up the heat.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:31.480
What will happen to the trees? Will fear and doubt cause them to shrivel up and die during the drought?

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:42.480
No. If you notice there in verse 8, Jehovah says the righteous will not notice the heat and not be anxious in the drought.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:50.480
Well, why is Jehovah confident that the righteous trees won't notice the heat and won't whither up in the drought?

00:12:50.480 --> 00:13:03.480
Look at verse 7 of Jeremiah 17. Is as blessed as the man who puts his trust in Jehovah, whose confidence is in Jehovah.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:11.480
So what will you do in the year of drought? Trust in Jehovah.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:20.480
You see, Satan wants to destroy our trust in Jehovah, right from the very first with Eve. Is it really so?

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:27.480
His whole system is built on fear, uncertainty, and doubt.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:35.480
Persecution we could liken it to when you're in an airplane and it has some turbulence and it begins to shake.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:46.480
One flight I was on, there was one woman that cried in terror. She screamed out loud every time the plane shook even just a little.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:56.480
I mean, she was genuinely terrified. I felt sorry for her. But the experienced flyers, they were eating, reading, watching movies.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:11.480
They didn't even notice the turbulence. Why? Well, from experience, they knew that the plane could easily handle such small amount of turbulence and they were not worried. It was designed for that.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:23.480
Well, we are like experienced flyers. We don't let the turbulence or persecution of this system cause us fear or doubt.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:28.480
With Jehovah and Jesus as our pilots, we don't need to be anxious, do we?

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:40.480
Let's consider two ways that we can show trust in Jehovah as Jeremiah 177 says. First, we're going to talk about trusting the faithful and discreet slave and trusting Bible principles.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:52.480
Let's talk first about trusting the faithful and discreet slave. The faithful and discreet slave has been selected and appointed by Jehovah and experiences shown we can trust them.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:15:05.480
You see, trust is built by repeated good experiences. Think of all the good experiences we've had with the faithful and discreet slave and following their direction.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:17.480
Now, some might reason, well, you know, the direction from the faithful and discreet slave is good for the United States, but they don't understand here. They don't understand my assignment where I've been assigned.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:27.269
We need to do things differently. Trust in the faithful and discreet slave is not geographical.

00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:36.269
Jehovah's direction through the faithful and discreet slave applies to all of God's people all over the earth.

00:15:36.269 --> 00:15:43.269
See, fear is really a loss of memory of what Jehovah has done for us.

00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:56.269
Satan wants us to forget all the good experiences we've had with the faithful and discreet slave and let one moment of fear get to us and cause us to wither in the heat.

00:15:56.269 --> 00:16:06.269
Second Thessalonians chapter 2 and verse 2 says, not to be quickly shaken from your reason, nor to be alarmed, especially at rumors.

00:16:06.269 --> 00:16:13.269
Trust in the faithful and discreet slave is going to be put to the test. Satan will make sure of that.

00:16:13.269 --> 00:16:24.269
It could be your own thoughts. I know better. Or maybe some twisted lies you read or hear. Either way, it's a trap.

00:16:24.269 --> 00:16:32.269
Stay away from such ideas. Trust what you know about the faithful and discreet slave.

00:16:32.269 --> 00:16:41.269
Isaiah 30-15 says, your strength will be in keeping calm and showing trust.

00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:52.269
Remember, the faithful and discreet slave has been selected and appointed by Jehovah and our experience has shown that we can trust them.

00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:57.269
Now let's consider trusting Bible principles or second point.

00:16:57.269 --> 00:17:03.269
See, Bible principles are timeless pearls of wisdom from Jehovah.

00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:11.269
But many people today attack our decision to live by Bible principles in this modern world. They say that's outdated.

00:17:11.269 --> 00:17:19.269
However, we trust Bible principles because experience tells us they always work.

00:17:19.269 --> 00:17:28.269
One sister asks, what helps her to be calm in very difficult or trying situations? And she said, give me a scripture.

00:17:28.269 --> 00:17:40.269
Jesus' mother Mary had that same give me a scripture attitude. Luke 251 says that Mary made it her habit to keep these sayings in her heart.

00:17:40.269 --> 00:17:47.269
See, Mary was really like a tree soaking in all of these waters of Jesus' teaching and his amazing miracles.

00:17:47.269 --> 00:17:56.269
While the heat for Mary came when the Pharisees and Sadducees, maybe even her own family, their neighbors began to attack Jesus.

00:17:56.269 --> 00:18:02.269
Call him names, slander his reputation and attack his motives.

00:18:02.269 --> 00:18:07.269
What helped Mary to deal with the heat?

00:18:07.269 --> 00:18:11.269
Those waters that she had treasured up in her heart.

00:18:11.269 --> 00:18:22.970
What Bible principles and experiences are you keeping in your heart to help you when you come under attack?

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:30.970
Be like Mary and keep in your heart your good experiences in applying Bible principles.

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:38.970
Stick to what you know works, Bible principles. They always work and they never get out of date.

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:43.970
Not you or anyone else can come up with better principles to live by.

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:54.970
Remember, we trust Bible principles because they come from Jehovah and our own experience tells us they always work.

00:18:54.970 --> 00:19:06.970
Now, trusting the faithful and discreet slave and trusting the Bible are just two of many ways that we can show that we trust Jehovah.

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:13.970
So what will you do in the year of drought? Trust in Jehovah.

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:20.970
Think of the birds. When they're flying high up there, are they worried, oh, I think I'm going to fall. I'm really worried.

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:29.970
Well, no, birds don't worry about that. Do they? Why? What will they rely on the wings and instincts Jehovah gave them? They can fly.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:38.970
Likewise, we don't need to be anxious when faced with lies, bands, or attacks on our Bible principles.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:49.970
Jehovah has given us what we need to fly, so to speak, the faithful and discreet slave, Bible principles, prayer, Holy Spirit, and more.

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:59.970
And we had further into the system as the heat from this system intensifies. Remember, fear and doubt are reactions.

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:15.269
But our decision is trust and courage.

00:20:15.269 --> 00:20:24.269
Thank you very much, brother Echron. We really appreciated that. I neglected to mention that brother Echron is the help of the coordinators committee.

00:20:24.269 --> 00:20:30.269
As Chairman, you'd probably appreciate. It's hard for me to take notes. There are a few other things I'm worried about.

00:20:30.269 --> 00:20:42.269
But I did jot down a few things here. Drought won't make us doubt. Trust is a must. So hopefully I've got something I'll remember from brother Echron's talk.

00:20:42.269 --> 00:20:52.269
Well, now brother William Turner, who is a help with the service committee, is giving us a challenging question. The theme is, have you become a different person?

00:20:52.269 --> 00:21:08.730
Well, I think it's safe to say that with all of the training and restructuring instruction you received, you definitely are not the same individuals you were when you first arrived at Patterson.

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:17.730
But how exactly have you changed? And why is it important that you continue to do so?

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:30.730
Well, let's consider this by looking at someone who, just like you, received a special privilege. His privilege was being the first divinely selected king of Israel.

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:42.730
So the man was Saul. When Saul was anointed, the prophet Samuel gave him three prophetic signs in order to confirm that Jehovah was with him.

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:52.730
I invite you to start with me and your Bible, please, to 1 Samuel chapter 10. And as we read verse 6, note what was to happen after the last sign.

00:21:52.730 --> 00:22:10.859
Chapter 10 verse 6 says, the spirit of Jehovah will empower you and you will prophesy along with him and be changed into a different person.

00:22:10.859 --> 00:22:20.859
Now, what did this change mean? Would Saul, all of a sudden, become unrecognizable? Or would there be a drastic change in his personality?

00:22:20.859 --> 00:22:31.859
Well, let's go back one chapter to chapter 9. In verse 21, here we get a glimpse of Saul's personality before he will appoint it as king.

00:22:31.859 --> 00:22:44.859
Verse 21 says that this Saul answered, am I not a Benjamin Knight of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? Am I family the most insignificant of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin?

00:22:45.859 --> 00:22:55.859
So why have you spoken to me in this way? So Saul shows himself to be a very humble, modest individual.

00:22:55.859 --> 00:23:08.859
Well, how about after his appointment as king? Let's go back to chapter 10. If you look in verse 22, here we see Saul's introduction as king to the people.

00:23:08.859 --> 00:23:20.859
Verse 22 says, so they inquired of Jehovah, has the man come here yet? Jehovah answered, there he is, hiding himself among the luggage.

00:23:20.859 --> 00:23:37.859
So evidently, still modest, still humble. Interestingly, the inside book mentions that about a month after his appointment as king, Saul gained a couple of great military victories against the Ammonites and later against the Philistines.

00:23:37.859 --> 00:24:04.269
So now you think about that. How did Saul change? And rather quickly, from bashfully hiding among luggage, to leading a nation to victory, that is evidence of the power of God's spirit, and the impact that it can have when one allows it to be operative in their lives.

00:24:05.269 --> 00:24:13.269
So what's the lesson? All of you have manifested qualities that are very pleasing and useful to Jehovah.

00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:19.269
It has allowed you to be productive in your assignment. It's allowed you to now have this privilege of Gilead training.

00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:29.269
But as you now go to your assignments, you're going to continue to need to have that spirit operative in your life.

00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:36.269
And just as we've seen in the case of Saul, that will not always mean a drastic change in your personality.

00:24:36.269 --> 00:24:47.269
Perhaps when we think of that expression, someone becoming a different person, maybe that's where our mind goes, to someone who has come out of Satan's world, now into Jehovah's organization, and they put on the new personality.

00:24:47.269 --> 00:25:01.269
And that's correct. But the reality is all Christians, even though spiritually mature, need to be adjusted from time to time.

00:25:01.269 --> 00:25:05.269
And those adjustments can have a tremendous impact.

00:25:05.269 --> 00:25:15.269
Perhaps your personality is such that you are naturally shy and reserved. Maybe you would be quite comfortable. No problem staying with the luggage.

00:25:16.269 --> 00:25:32.269
But now, having God's spirit, coupled with appreciation for what you've learned, will now perhaps move you to come out of your comfort zone, to initiate ways to share things that you've learned with others.

00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:41.779
Or maybe before you came to Gilead, you had very good leadership skills. You had to take charge for a personality one who got things done.

00:25:41.779 --> 00:25:55.779
But now you may see the need to adjust. You recognize there is wisdom in perhaps slowing down, or even waiting, perhaps even seeking input from others.

00:25:55.779 --> 00:26:03.779
You see, with the help of God's spirit, it can help you to become a kinder overseer, a better shepherd, one who's more tolerant, empathetic of others.

00:26:03.779 --> 00:26:18.059
It's just tremendous benefits all the way around. But the extent that you become different depends upon you and your response to God's spirit.

00:26:18.059 --> 00:26:27.059
Now, obviously, we know Saul's story. It does not end well. Instead of maintaining his reliance on Jehovah, he begins to trust his own judgment.

00:26:27.059 --> 00:26:34.059
He focuses more on his position as king than he does with his relationship with God.

00:26:34.059 --> 00:26:39.059
And it's quite interesting if you're still in chapter 10. If you look in verse 27,

00:26:39.059 --> 00:26:47.059
when Saul had God's spirit, even when he encountered challenges, in this particular case, some questioning his appointment,

00:26:47.059 --> 00:26:58.059
you notice Saul didn't feel the need to prove himself or challenge the men. He just stayed silent and focused on his assignment.

00:26:58.059 --> 00:27:04.059
But you read a little later, when he lost God's spirit, when that bad spirit began to take over him,

00:27:04.059 --> 00:27:11.059
and now the negative comments, the comments of others saw the strike down his thousands, and David's his tens of thousands.

00:27:11.059 --> 00:27:25.059
Oh, well, now it's an issue. It's a problem. It affected his judgment, it affected his emotions, caused him to make bad decisions.

00:27:25.059 --> 00:27:30.059
So what can help you to avoid that and to keep your focus?

00:27:30.059 --> 00:27:38.059
Well, let's look at the example of the other Saul, this mentioned in the Bible, the man who later became the Apostle Paul.

00:27:38.059 --> 00:27:44.059
Now we know obviously Paul's personality needed more than a refinement, Paul needed a complete overhaul.

00:27:44.059 --> 00:27:53.059
But he truly became a different person by way of God's spirit, and he was given a privilege to serve as an apostle to the nations.

00:27:53.059 --> 00:28:03.059
But if you turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 15, let's just note the attitude that Paul showed, 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verse 9.

00:28:03.059 --> 00:28:13.880
He says, for I am the least of the apostles, and I'm not worthy of being a cold and a apostle because I persecuted the congregation of God.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:22.880
But by God's undeserved kindness, I am what I am. Beautiful perspective, isn't it?

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:32.880
Now why do you think Paul was able to maintain this humble attitude for the rest of his life whereas King Saul could not?

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:40.880
Well, both men knew that it was only by means of Jehovah's undeserved kindness that they could enjoy their privilege of service.

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:50.880
But Paul never viewed his privilege of service greater than his relationship with God.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:29:01.880
That's why he studied. He meditated. He discerned God's will for him, and then he was alert to follow the leadings of God's spirit.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:08.880
And into the assignment Paul had challenges. You remember early on for parts of three years, some of the brothers didn't even believe he was an apostle.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:17.880
But yet he never asserted his authority. He never distanced himself from his brothers.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:24.880
He just loved them. He let his examples speak for him, and you can do the same.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:33.880
See, let the brothers feel. Let them see the love that you have for Jehovah and the love that you have for them.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:43.190
So in review, maintain those wonderful traits that qualified you for Gilead, like your modesty and humility.

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:49.190
And then study, meditate, continue to follow the leadings of God's spirit.

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:56.190
And when it becomes apparent that changes need to be made, either for the sake of the work or peace with your brother,

00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:59.190
well, please be willing to make them.

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:10.190
And if you do, you will show that you have become a different person, one who is refined, one who is useful, one who is dearly loved by Jehovah.

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:27.369
And may Jehovah continue to bless you and all of the hard work that you do in behalf of his name.

00:30:27.369 --> 00:30:35.369
Thank you very much, Brother Turner. We really appreciated that. So my quick notes, don't change the change.

00:30:35.369 --> 00:30:38.369
Continue to make the right change.

00:30:38.369 --> 00:30:44.369
Good. Well, now we have the privilege of listening to the member of the governing body, Brother Kenneth Cook.

00:30:44.369 --> 00:30:53.859
And Brother Cook is going to talk to us on the theme, find joy in Jehovah's gradual blessing.

00:30:53.859 --> 00:31:01.859
As you know from your own life experience and from your Gilead instruction, Jehovah is a God of action.

00:31:01.859 --> 00:31:05.859
And as such, he does some things quickly, doesn't he?

00:31:05.859 --> 00:31:13.859
And that's so true when it's needed or it's warranted, he makes sure it happens just at the right time.

00:31:14.859 --> 00:31:24.859
For example, when a sudden stiff breeze rushed into the upper room at Pentecost, those present were filled with Holy Spirit.

00:31:24.859 --> 00:31:35.859
In another example, the Bible tells us that when this world in some way says that it has achieved peace and security, what happens next.

00:31:35.859 --> 00:31:44.859
First Thessalonians 5 and verse 3 says that sudden destruction will come instantly on them.

00:31:44.859 --> 00:31:50.859
But not all things that Jehovah causes to happen occur so quickly.

00:31:50.859 --> 00:31:54.859
In fact, he often does things gradually.

00:31:54.859 --> 00:31:59.859
Let's look at two examples and see what we can learn from them.

00:31:59.859 --> 00:32:08.859
First we will look at the angels and creation and then resurrected ones and perfection.

00:32:08.859 --> 00:32:18.859
Finally, we will look at how this applies to you and how you can find great joy in a gradual blessing.

00:32:18.859 --> 00:32:24.859
We begin with the angels who were on hand when Jehovah made the earth and all the things in it.

00:32:24.859 --> 00:32:35.859
What did the angels see? Did they see an instant burst of unimaginable power that suddenly formed the earth and all life on it?

00:32:35.859 --> 00:32:39.859
Not at all. Jehovah could have done that.

00:32:39.859 --> 00:32:43.859
But instead he created things gradually.

00:32:43.859 --> 00:32:56.859
Job chapter 38 and verses 5 and 6 speak of him as setting the earth's measurements, sinking its pedestals and laying its cornerstone.

00:32:56.859 --> 00:33:07.859
And in Genesis chapters 1 and 2, we also read about how he gradually brought forth life on earth and ultimately humans.

00:33:08.859 --> 00:33:16.859
Imagine the joy that his angelic sons experienced as they watched what Jehovah was gradually doing.

00:33:16.859 --> 00:33:26.859
For example, undoubtedly the angels could see that their Heavenly Father received great satisfaction from a job well done.

00:33:26.859 --> 00:33:45.859
They would also learn about facets of Jehovah's marvelous personality as they observed everything from the first whale breaching the surface of an ocean to a hummingbird hovering over a beautiful flower or seeing lion cubs playing together.

00:33:46.859 --> 00:34:06.859
So stupendous was Jehovah's work and so enriching this experience for his angelic sons that Job chapter 38 and verse 7 tells us that at some point on seeing all of this and seeing the earth formed they began shouting in applause.

00:34:06.859 --> 00:34:14.860
That gradual blessing is something that the faithful angels will never forget.

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:24.860
In fact, God's Word tells us that the angels are still focused on what Jehovah is doing in the earth especially with regard to his people.

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:33.860
First Peter chapter 1 and verse 12 says that into these very things angels are desiring to peer.

00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:41.860
So then do the angels find pleasure in Jehovah's gradual work and blessing, yes they do.

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:49.860
And aren't we grateful that they love Jehovah so much as well as each one of us?

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:54.860
What do we learn from their response to Jehovah's gradual work?

00:34:54.860 --> 00:35:05.860
We learn to treasure every moment in Jehovah's service and to be grateful for every opportunity we have to learn more about him.

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:14.860
So be like the angels and in effect shout in applause at each new thing you learn about our Heavenly Father.

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:25.860
Take time to meditate on his works, on his Word of Truth, and on his indescribable mercy toward us through his Son.

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:31.860
In our next example we look to the future but not too far into the future.

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:39.860
We're talking about the resurrection, specifically resurrection and perfection.

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:53.860
When Jehovah through his Son resurrects countless millions to life again in the new world they will not all come back at the same time nor will they come back in perfection.

00:35:53.860 --> 00:36:01.860
But Jehovah will bring them back in such a way that they will know themselves, they will recognize themselves.

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:14.860
Although their serious infirmities will be gone, they will instantly know their own familiar thoughts and feelings, they will know who they are as a person.

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:26.860
Imagine the joy that such ones will have as they apply what they learn and then see the progress that they are making day after day in serving Jehovah.

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:32.860
They will experience the words of Proverbs 10 and verse 22 coming true for them.

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:37.860
Please follow along where it says in verse 22,

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:44.860
it is the blessing of Jehovah that makes one rich and he adds no pain with it.

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:52.179
So what is God's or will God's gradual blessing do for such ones at that time?

00:36:53.179 --> 00:37:09.179
His blessing will make them rich in the most important way of all and that is spiritually things that they struggle to be able to overcome in this old world under man's control and Satan's influence.

00:37:09.179 --> 00:37:17.179
They will be able to overcome because they loved Jehovah and he will help them to do so.

00:37:17.179 --> 00:37:33.179
But even more than this, in the new world, millions and millions of people will come to experience physical vitality and strength that exceeds anything imaginable today.

00:37:33.179 --> 00:37:40.179
Jehovah's gradual blessing will take hold and grateful ones will rejoice day after day.

00:37:40.179 --> 00:37:59.179
Also important is the fact that as each person grows toward perfection, they will keep hold of the empathy needed to teach and help still others who will come back in a gradual resurrection.

00:37:59.179 --> 00:38:07.179
How can contemplating such future blessings benefit us, benefit you right now?

00:38:07.179 --> 00:38:17.179
We benefit when we patiently focus on Jehovah and how he often fulfills his promises in a gradual way.

00:38:17.179 --> 00:38:27.179
Having this in mind keeps us grounded, you could say, we do our best but we do not expect everything right now, do we?

00:38:27.179 --> 00:38:32.179
Especially perfection, that is yet in the future.

00:38:32.179 --> 00:38:40.179
However, when we develop strong faith, we will find joy no matter what we will yet face. Why?

00:38:40.179 --> 00:38:47.179
Because we are absolutely certain that Jehovah's promises will come true right on time.

00:38:47.179 --> 00:38:52.179
Now we get to the part that especially involves you.

00:38:52.179 --> 00:39:04.650
As one graduating from Gilea School, you may look back on the past five months and worry that you did not do everything perfectly.

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:09.650
I know that's how I would feel, but please don't focus on that.

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:22.650
Instead imagine the joy that you will find as you patiently apply the things that you have learned and then you see Jehovah's gradual blessing on your efforts.

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:33.650
Remember, a head full of knowledge is not what brings Jehovah's blessing, what matters is what we do with what we know.

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:36.650
Consider the example of King Solomon.

00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:47.650
First King is chapter 4 and verse 32 says that he composed 3,000 Proverbs and 1,000 and 5 solos.

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:55.650
But there was a disconnect between what was in his mind and what was really driving him from the heart.

00:39:55.650 --> 00:40:00.650
And as a result, Solomon drifted away from Jehovah, didn't he?

00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:14.650
The Bible tells us that his foreign wives gradually inclined his heart away from Jehovah so you could say that he in effect substituted one gradual thing for another gradual thing.

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:22.650
In turn, he lost the opportunity to find joy in Jehovah's gradual blessing.

00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:29.650
Now, in contrast to that example, make it your heart's desire to be like the faithful angels.

00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:43.650
Although they undoubtedly know far more than 3,000 Proverbs and songs, they savor every morsel that they learn about our magnificent Heavenly Father.

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:55.650
And again, as you look to the future, to the real life, take what you have learned in this beautiful schooling and humbly work for the interests of others.

00:40:55.650 --> 00:41:06.650
Jehovah will bless that effort and the gradual blessing that you will enjoy will serve as a taste of what is yet ahead in God's new world.

00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:34.500
Keep in mind that those who find joy now in a gradual blessing will have no problem in patiently waiting for and then enjoying the gradual blessings that are still to come.

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:39.500
Thank you very much, Brother Cook. We truly appreciated those fine comments.

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:42.500
I just had a brief note here.

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:49.059
Expect the unexpected gradually. Well, I'm sure we all got that point.

00:41:49.059 --> 00:41:56.059
And we'll enjoy looking forward to seeing that program at that talk again and going through the main points.

00:41:56.059 --> 00:42:02.059
Now, for your students, you're about to be addressed by one of your instructors from Gilead.

00:42:02.059 --> 00:42:13.059
You've heard from Brother Kothwin a number of times and now he's going to address you this final time on this intriguing theme, shoulder to shoulder.

00:42:13.059 --> 00:42:23.300
By the spring of 1945, Allied and Russian armies were converging upon Germany.

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:36.300
The Nazis were losing the war. The Germans gave the ominous order. March all the concentration camp prisoners west and destroy all the evidence of the horrors that had taken place in those camps.

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:42.300
On the 20th of April, the evacuation of Saxon House began.

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:51.300
The plan was to march the prisoners to the Baltic coast, ship them out to sea and drown them.

00:42:51.300 --> 00:43:01.900
And if that wasn't horrific enough, the SS guards had explicit orders to shoot any of the prisoners who couldn't keep up.

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:11.900
Already in a weakened state, hundreds were shot along the way, while many thousands more died of exposure, starvation and exhaustion.

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:26.719
Thus began what came to be known as a death march. Interestingly, the Saxon House and evacuation included 230 of our brothers.

00:43:26.719 --> 00:43:34.719
And just like the other prisoners, they were in no shape to make this journey physically.

00:43:34.719 --> 00:43:39.719
But they were more than up to the journey spiritually.

00:43:39.719 --> 00:43:48.719
How so? To open your Bibles, if you would, to a promise Jehovah made, it's found in Zephaniah chapter 3 and verse 9.

00:43:48.719 --> 00:43:57.719
And here he promised to give to his people a pure language, and the point being so that they could do what?

00:43:57.719 --> 00:44:06.719
The latter part of that verse says, to serve him shoulder to shoulder, or as the footnote says, in unity.

00:44:06.719 --> 00:44:15.719
And that was the key. The secret weapon was their shoulder to shoulder unity.

00:44:15.719 --> 00:44:20.719
Even the weak become strong when they are united.

00:44:20.719 --> 00:44:25.719
Now today you and I are on a march for life.

00:44:25.719 --> 00:44:34.719
And never forget that we're not marching alone. We have our brothers and sisters from all backgrounds and all ages along with us for the journey.

00:44:34.719 --> 00:44:40.719
But the question is, are we marching shoulder to shoulder?

00:44:40.719 --> 00:44:45.719
What can we learn from our brothers who went through this death march?

00:44:46.719 --> 00:44:57.719
Well, first of all, to reach the coast, the Saxon House and prisoners were to march 155 miles. That's 250 kilometers.

00:44:57.719 --> 00:45:05.719
And throughout that journey, the witnesses pooled all their food supplies into one small bundle that was used for the benefit of all.

00:45:05.719 --> 00:45:13.719
Now you can imagine that sharing food is not an easy thing to do when you've already been starved and you're very weak.

00:45:13.719 --> 00:45:27.719
But our brothers knew Bible principles, such as one of Proverbs 11, 25 that says the generous person will prosper and whoever refreshes others will himself be refreshed.

00:45:27.719 --> 00:45:38.719
So what's the lesson for us today? The lesson is this, unity to be real must withstand the severest test.

00:45:38.719 --> 00:45:45.719
Being a true Christian is more than a commitment to God. It is a commitment to other Christians as well.

00:45:45.719 --> 00:45:51.719
So don't hold back. Show a generous disposition in your assignment.

00:45:51.719 --> 00:45:58.719
And remember, one of the most important resources that you can share with others is your time.

00:45:58.719 --> 00:46:09.719
So learn the balance. Take time with others who may need it. And don't be ruled by time, rather than rush, refresh.

00:46:09.719 --> 00:46:21.670
Second point, when the SS guards gave the witnesses a card to haul, that easily could have seemed like just another burden to bear.

00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:29.670
But instead, our brothers were thrilled. Why? Because they saw it as an opportunity. How so?

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:35.670
Well, during the journey, the sick and elderly ones were able to set on top of the card and rest for a while.

00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:40.670
And then when one would get his strength back, another one would replace him.

00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:45.670
And so in a very real way, they carried one another.

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:52.670
Lesson for us. Where there is unity, there is victory.

00:46:52.670 --> 00:47:01.670
And in the middle of difficulty lies opportunity. So look for opportunities to encourage one another.

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:06.670
The word encourage literally means to make strong or to hearten.

00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:16.670
Being spiritual people, we may not lose our hope, but we could lose heart, especially during times of extreme crisis or grief.

00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:23.670
But something as simple as a reassuring word or even a kind deed can work like a miracle.

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:28.670
It can restore the weary soul. It can carry others through a hard time.

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:38.670
So the point is this. You're not responsible for every one in the Christian congregation, but you are responsible to them.

00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:50.670
Jehovah expects us to do whatever we can to help our brothers. We simply cannot allow ourselves to be separated in interest or divided in purpose.

00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:57.670
And then one more point. On their last night, the prisoners were stopped near for us.

00:47:57.670 --> 00:48:02.670
The SS guards encouraged everyone to walk across the freedom.

00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:07.670
Imagine you were there. It must have seemed very tempting.

00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:13.670
But naturally, they were unsure of what to do. So they prayed for guidance.

00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:19.670
And unitedly, they decided to stay put. Now one of them left the group.

00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:25.670
Later it was learned that those had accepted the offer. We're shot down.

00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:32.670
The lesson for us. Don't allow anything or anyone to cause division.

00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:42.670
Satan is the master of divide and conquer. We must stand together until forever.

00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:51.670
When problems arise, use your energy. You can use your energy for retaliation or resolution, but not both.

00:48:51.670 --> 00:49:01.670
The Bible says, have intense love for one another. So don't allow differences to develop into distance and don't nurture past offenses.

00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:13.670
Brotherhood is a place where mistakes are not rubbed in, but rubbed out to recap.

00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:18.670
We serve God in part, brothers, by serving others.

00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:23.670
Willingly share your resources with one another, especially your time.

00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:29.670
It's in times of deep crisis and grief and doubt that we need each other the most.

00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:36.670
When you see a brother or sister's shoulders beginning to droop, pull out your cart for them.

00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:40.670
Do what is needed, even if it's difficult or inconvenient.

00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:46.670
Remember, our actions reveal what's in our heart, whether we like it or not.

00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:51.670
Have intense love for one another.

00:49:51.670 --> 00:50:00.670
Remain united in heart and mind. Continue committed to one another as you are to Jehovah God and Jesus Christ.

00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:06.670
And finally, there is beauty and power in unity.

00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:17.670
Jehovah is creating a new world, brothers and sisters, a new world, one world, one people, a new world society of unified worshipers.

00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:31.139
Stay focused on that fact. In conclusion, over 10,700 lost their lives on that infamous death march from Saxonhausen.

00:50:31.139 --> 00:50:38.139
But not one, not one of our 230 brothers lost their life. Why?

00:50:38.139 --> 00:50:41.139
Well, let's let them tell us in their own words.

00:50:41.139 --> 00:50:49.139
Here's a quotation from a resolution made by our brothers in that forest just before their freedom.

00:50:49.139 --> 00:50:54.139
I quote, a long hard time of trial is behind us.

00:50:54.139 --> 00:51:00.139
And we have been brought forth from the fiery furnace without a scent of the fire upon us.

00:51:00.139 --> 00:51:06.139
On the contrary, we are full of power and strength in Jehovah.

00:51:06.139 --> 00:51:11.139
We have only one desire after our stay in the lion's stand.

00:51:11.139 --> 00:51:15.139
We will serve Jehovah throughout eternity.

00:51:15.139 --> 00:51:19.139
This would be our most precious reward.

00:51:19.139 --> 00:51:24.139
And sign your co-fighters for Jehovah's holy name.

00:51:24.139 --> 00:51:28.139
You see, they didn't pretend to be brothers. They were brothers.

00:51:28.139 --> 00:51:34.139
They functioned as one united family throughout the whole ordeal, and they were victorious.

00:51:34.139 --> 00:51:44.139
And so as this world grows colder and colder, brothers, let us be more determined than ever to serve our God,

00:51:44.139 --> 00:51:46.139
shoulder to shoulder.

00:51:46.139 --> 00:52:12.619
Thank you so much, brother Kothrun. There were so many excellent points in that talk.

00:52:12.619 --> 00:52:18.960
What did I write down to remind me? Shoulder to shoulder.

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:23.960
I did also write down those imperfections, don't rub in, rub out.

00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:30.960
Well, there's a lot of good points that your dear students soon to be graduates are taking down, I'm sure.

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:37.960
Now you're going to listen to another brother who's very familiar to you, one of your instructors.

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:45.960
But the difference is this time, you're not going to be looking at him and thinking of written exercises.

00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:51.960
But you're going to be thinking, well, I can sit back and enjoy these comments.

00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:58.960
Brother Mark Numer, a helper with the teaching committee, as well as an instructor of Gilead,

00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:05.559
now talk to you on the theme, four words to live by.

00:53:05.559 --> 00:53:10.559
Can there really be four words that you can base your life on?

00:53:10.559 --> 00:53:13.559
And if so, what would they be?

00:53:13.559 --> 00:53:16.559
Well, we look to our exemplar Christ Jesus for the answer.

00:53:16.559 --> 00:53:20.559
We focus on the night before his death.

00:53:20.559 --> 00:53:24.559
The future of every human being rested upon his shoulders.

00:53:24.559 --> 00:53:29.559
His words, his actions, his very thoughts in these critical moments

00:53:29.559 --> 00:53:33.559
will be remembered for thousands of years.

00:53:33.559 --> 00:53:37.559
What would he give the world to remember?

00:53:37.559 --> 00:53:40.559
He left no room for guesswork.

00:53:40.559 --> 00:53:49.559
In one verse, one verse, Jesus reveals what governs his every action, his decision in one verse.

00:53:49.559 --> 00:53:54.559
Four words, four words that he lived by.

00:53:54.559 --> 00:53:58.559
And we encourage you to live by these four words.

00:53:58.559 --> 00:54:02.559
We encourage you to take these four words to heart.

00:54:02.559 --> 00:54:04.559
Take them seriously.

00:54:04.559 --> 00:54:09.559
They're found in John chapter 14 and verse 31.

00:54:09.559 --> 00:54:16.219
John 14, 31, last night of Jesus' life.

00:54:16.219 --> 00:54:24.219
But for the world to know that I love the Father, I love the Father.

00:54:24.219 --> 00:54:31.219
In these four words, we find the most powerful bond in the universe.

00:54:31.219 --> 00:54:36.219
An unbreakable bond of love between Jesus and his Father.

00:54:36.219 --> 00:54:47.219
And it is this unbreakable attachment that enabled Jesus to unselfishly defend his Father's reputation to his dying breath,

00:54:47.219 --> 00:54:52.219
trusting that your hope would protect and resurrect him.

00:54:53.219 --> 00:54:55.219
I love the Father.

00:54:55.219 --> 00:54:58.219
But how did this love develop?

00:54:58.219 --> 00:55:03.219
How did this unbreakable bond, this attachment of love develop?

00:55:03.219 --> 00:55:06.219
Well, the only begotten Son was created perfect, true.

00:55:06.219 --> 00:55:13.219
However, was he created with love already fully developed? No.

00:55:13.219 --> 00:55:18.219
He was created with a free will. Satan was created with a free will.

00:55:18.219 --> 00:55:23.219
And the capacity to extend in large and enrich this love.

00:55:23.219 --> 00:55:32.219
The Son of God was not created with an unselfish self-sacrificing love already fully in place.

00:55:32.219 --> 00:55:34.219
What did he have to do?

00:55:34.219 --> 00:55:40.219
He had to cultivate this deep attachment for his Father, cultivate this deep love.

00:55:40.219 --> 00:55:42.219
How did he do that?

00:55:42.219 --> 00:55:47.219
By observing his Father's personality.

00:55:47.219 --> 00:55:51.219
In his pre-human existence, imagine how the Son would do this.

00:55:51.219 --> 00:55:58.219
He would observe closely how his Father used his power, how he used his authority, how he used his strength.

00:55:58.219 --> 00:56:05.219
In behalf of people, those crushed, those lowly in spirit.

00:56:05.219 --> 00:56:11.219
He would observe how his Father used his power to help those crushed in spirit.

00:56:11.219 --> 00:56:18.219
He watched his Father deal with Ruth, the mobile girl, a mobile girl from a pagan nation.

00:56:18.219 --> 00:56:21.219
Might he have thought, now, mobile girl?

00:56:21.219 --> 00:56:23.219
Weren't these the mobile women?

00:56:23.219 --> 00:56:30.219
Weren't these the very women that lowered the Israelite men into immorality right on the threshold of the promised land?

00:56:30.219 --> 00:56:32.219
True.

00:56:32.219 --> 00:56:35.219
But his Father saw this girl was different.

00:56:35.219 --> 00:56:39.219
She was different. What a lesson for the Son of God.

00:56:39.219 --> 00:56:45.219
His Father did not put people in categories. He did not stereotype individuals.

00:56:45.219 --> 00:56:49.219
Oh, that's the mobile, I'm not going to deal with her.

00:56:49.219 --> 00:56:54.219
No. Jehovah God looked at Ruth as an individual.

00:56:54.219 --> 00:56:56.219
And the Son's love must have grown.

00:56:56.219 --> 00:57:02.219
As now he allows this girl, he allows a Bible book to be named in behalf of her Ruth,

00:57:02.219 --> 00:57:04.219
as opposed to Naomi or Boaz.

00:57:04.219 --> 00:57:06.219
Ruth, a mobile girl.

00:57:06.219 --> 00:57:08.219
That's right.

00:57:08.219 --> 00:57:19.219
And the Son's love would have continued to grow when he observed how his Father then allowed this girl to become an ancestors to the Messiah.

00:57:19.219 --> 00:57:25.219
But watching and admiring his Father wasn't enough, he went further.

00:57:25.219 --> 00:57:35.219
As the Son continued to develop appreciation for his Father's qualities, this bond of love became more than just a feeling.

00:57:35.219 --> 00:57:40.219
No, his love for his Father began to shape his decisions and actions.

00:57:40.219 --> 00:57:43.219
And Jesus demonstrated this when he was on earth.

00:57:43.219 --> 00:57:47.219
He didn't just say the words, I love the Father.

00:57:47.219 --> 00:57:52.219
He didn't just feel the words, feel I love the Father's cozy warm little feeling.

00:57:52.219 --> 00:57:57.219
No, no, no. He lived those words.

00:57:57.219 --> 00:58:02.219
And that is why Jesus could say in the second half of John 1431,

00:58:02.219 --> 00:58:09.630
I am doing just as the Father has commanded me to do.

00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:12.630
I am doing, you see.

00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:19.630
His entire life course proved that he loved the Father.

00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:27.630
For example, when a sireo Phoenician woman begged Jesus to cure her demonized daughter.

00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:35.630
Initially, Jesus says, no, I was sent forth not to the Gentiles, but to the Jews.

00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:41.630
But the woman would not give up in showing her face. She kept asking and asking.

00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:55.630
So in light of this exceptional circumstance, Jesus could see this was no time to enforce a general rule or to stereotype people,

00:58:55.630 --> 00:59:01.630
to become inflexible, to put her in a category, oh no, your agenda, your sireo Phoenician, no, no.

00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:10.630
Now Jesus saw this was a time to bend in response to higher principles.

00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:15.630
Did he remember how his Father handled that situation with Ruth?

00:59:15.630 --> 00:59:19.630
And this moved him to my father did that with Ruth.

00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:21.630
Now we have a similar situation.

00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:24.630
What would my Father want me to do?

00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:28.630
Jesus helps the sireo Phoenician woman.

00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:34.630
He was ready to act in imitation of his Father's love.

00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:40.630
Another example would be what Jesus learned from his Father about forgiveness.

00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:44.630
He watched his Father forgive, forgive people.

00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:50.630
He watched his Father forgive David for adultery, forgive David for the murder of Euryah.

00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:53.630
How many others did the Son of God watch?

00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:56.630
How many others did he watch his Father forgive?

00:59:56.630 --> 01:00:00.630
The Hebrew Scriptures are replete with Jehovah forgiving people.

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:06.630
He's a large-hearted forgiver. He's ready to forgive. He's on the lookout to forgive.

01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:10.630
That's what the Son of God learned.

01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:19.630
So this no doubt helped him to deal with the frequency of the imperfections of the apostles and others.

01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:26.630
Jesus viewed forgiving others as an opportunity to imitate his Father.

01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:37.630
Another opportunity to allow his actions to declare loud and clear like Father, like Son.

01:00:37.630 --> 01:00:43.630
He didn't just say, I love the Father, didn't just feel it.

01:00:43.630 --> 01:00:45.630
He lived it.

01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:54.630
Now we take this discussion out of the classroom and apply it to your real-life situations.

01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:58.630
Right after Jesus said, I love the Father.

01:00:58.630 --> 01:01:04.630
He said, get up. Let us go from here.

01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:10.630
Well soon you're going to get up and you're going to go from here.

01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:15.630
And you don't know what tests of faith are going to come upon you. You don't know.

01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:20.630
We can't anticipate every test that's going to come upon us of faith.

01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:31.099
However, if you know these four words, you know enough, etch these four words.

01:01:31.099 --> 01:01:35.099
I love the Father on your minds and on your hearts.

01:01:35.099 --> 01:01:41.099
Let these four words govern every decision and action of yours.

01:01:41.099 --> 01:01:48.099
For example, if you're entrusted with authority, how will you treat people?

01:01:48.099 --> 01:01:56.099
How will you treat those under you? Learn from Jesus on this last night.

01:01:56.099 --> 01:02:07.099
His words could have been all about Himself for the world to know that I am the Son of God.

01:02:07.099 --> 01:02:12.099
The first born of all creation, I am the second greatest personage in the universe.

01:02:12.099 --> 01:02:22.099
Or he could have said, I plan to surrender my life for you as in the ransom sacrifice for you.

01:02:22.099 --> 01:02:27.099
Or I am the one who fulfills all prophecy.

01:02:27.099 --> 01:02:34.099
But none of these thoughts were about Himself, His authority or His accomplishments.

01:02:34.099 --> 01:02:39.099
So like Jesus, don't focus on your position.

01:02:39.099 --> 01:02:46.099
Show by your dealings with others that your heartfelt desire and motives are to please your Heavenly Father.

01:02:46.099 --> 01:02:49.099
That's what you want to do.

01:02:49.099 --> 01:02:58.099
So as you go from here, who will be your Ruth?

01:02:58.099 --> 01:03:03.579
Show. You don't put people in categories.

01:03:03.579 --> 01:03:13.579
Show it. Instead of that department, that nationality holds that language group, those sisters.

01:03:13.579 --> 01:03:20.050
Who will be your sireo-finition woman?

01:03:20.050 --> 01:03:25.050
See's opportunities to be more flexible and reasonable.

01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:33.050
Dissurn. When it will be a time to bend in response to higher principles.

01:03:33.050 --> 01:03:42.050
Rather than always being on the lookout to check and correct, work hard to acquire thinking ability.

01:03:42.050 --> 01:03:50.050
Thinking ability that will assist you to respond to higher principles.

01:03:50.050 --> 01:03:53.050
Developing thinking ability is not easy.

01:03:53.050 --> 01:04:02.050
Because as you begin to think about a person, often your emotional reactions toward that person start interfering.

01:04:02.050 --> 01:04:15.050
You begin registering likes, dislikes, respect, disrespect, trust, distrust, reacting emotionally before beginning an intellectual appraisal.

01:04:15.050 --> 01:04:28.050
But if you make decisions solely based on feelings that have slipped in under the guise of thoughts, this often leads to poor decisions.

01:04:28.050 --> 01:04:32.050
So listen to what I'm going to tell you right now.

01:04:32.050 --> 01:04:40.809
Ask yourself, will my decision making process?

01:04:40.809 --> 01:04:49.809
Will it be in response to higher principles or simply because I do or don't like the person?

01:04:49.809 --> 01:04:56.809
When it's a response to higher principles, now your strengthening and stabilizing the organization.

01:04:56.809 --> 01:05:03.219
Who will be your imperfect, disappointing apostles?

01:05:03.219 --> 01:05:10.219
Be on the lookout for opportunities to be more forgiving, more patient with the shortcomings of others.

01:05:10.219 --> 01:05:18.219
Maybe you're an overseer and your imperfect, disappointing apostles will be those working under you.

01:05:18.219 --> 01:05:26.219
For others, it might be a fellow translator or a work made in your department that disappoints you.

01:05:27.219 --> 01:05:34.219
If this happens, will these four words govern your thinking?

01:05:34.219 --> 01:05:39.219
They did for one sister. This is what she says.

01:05:39.219 --> 01:05:46.219
Something that happened in my department hurt me deeply, and it shook me to my very core.

01:05:46.219 --> 01:05:51.219
And since then, I struggle with constant feelings of inadequacy.

01:05:51.219 --> 01:05:54.219
I felt completely discouraged and dried up.

01:05:54.219 --> 01:06:00.219
However, I'm not a quitter. I will cling to Jehovah and not let go.

01:06:00.219 --> 01:06:11.219
I love Jehovah above everything, and I'm sure that I will overcome my negative feelings and will become stronger spiritually and mentally.

01:06:11.219 --> 01:06:16.219
She just didn't say the words, I love the Father.

01:06:16.219 --> 01:06:26.559
She lived those words, four words that gave her a proper perspective and balance in life.

01:06:26.559 --> 01:06:40.260
So it comes down to this, when you cherish Jehovah's approval and your unbreakable bond of love for him,

01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:50.260
and this spiritual relationship overrides, supersedes our human sphere of activity, not much else matters.

01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:54.820
How do you reach that point?

01:06:54.820 --> 01:07:04.820
By thinking deeply on Jehovah's way of doing things, then loving those ways and then imitating your Heavenly Father.

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:15.519
At John 13, 15, Jesus said, I set the pattern for you.

01:07:15.519 --> 01:07:20.519
And it's a pattern that we are confident that you will follow.

01:07:20.519 --> 01:07:30.519
Like Jesus, show the world. It's your opportunity now to show the world that you two can meet any challenge and test the faith that comes your way.

01:07:30.519 --> 01:07:36.519
We know you can do it. We have confidence in you. Why do we know you can do it?

01:07:36.519 --> 01:08:07.619
Because you are clothed with the most unbreakable bond in the universe and empowered by the unfailing four words to live by, I love the Father.

01:08:07.619 --> 01:08:20.619
Well, even though you were able to listen to Brother Nameh and not have a written exercise afterwards, I'm sure like me, you wrote down those four words, I love the Father.

01:08:20.619 --> 01:08:23.619
Thank you very much, Brother Nameh. We really appreciate it that.

01:08:23.619 --> 01:08:30.619
And truly, there's been a abundance of good points that we've learned from the program so far.

01:08:30.619 --> 01:08:42.619
And then all of a sudden I realized this program is going to be broadcast on JW Broadcasting in 163 languages so I don't have to take notes after all.

01:08:42.619 --> 01:08:52.960
What an exciting and upbuilding program. And don't forget to tune in later this month for parts two and three of this special event.

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:57.960
To conclude, we'd like to share greetings from Taiwan.

01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:06.960
Taiwan is a southeast Asian island over 35,000 square kilometers or nearly 13,000 square miles in size.

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:11.960
It's densely populated with over 23 million inhabitants.

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:21.960
The first westerner who saw this island named it Ilya Formosa or Island Beautiful and it's not hard to see why.

01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:29.960
Taiwan has a beautiful coastline, fertile land and majestic mountains covered in thick, luxuriant forests.

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:36.960
The majority of the population lives on the narrow coastal plains where you'll find large bustling cities.

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:41.960
Manufacturing and exporting various goods drives the economy in Taiwan.

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:45.960
The official language of Taiwan is Mandarin Chinese.

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:50.960
However, there are also 16 recognized indigenous language groups.

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:55.960
One of the languages that our brothers reach out to is Amis.

01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:02.960
In January 2018, the Amis Remote Translation Office was open in Quailin City.

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:08.960
They translate written publications and produce audio publications in Amis.

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:13.960
In the Hualien Amis congregation, there are 80 publishers.

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:17.960
Five serve as elders and 22 are regular pioneers.

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:21.960
They conduct over 70 Bible studies each month.

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:29.960
These brothers search out Amis speaking people in Hualien City where they live alongside Chinese and men non-speaking people.

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:33.960
In the mountains, Amis speaking people are more isolated.

01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:39.960
So our brothers travel long distances using scooters to share the good news with them.

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:45.960
The brothers and sisters in the Hualien Amis congregation send you their warm love.

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:51.960
From the headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is JW Broadcasting.
