00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:08.259
I experienced civil unrest from the time I was born.

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:12.560
I thought it was unfair that so many people were killed,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.760
mained, injured, and had their lives ruined.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.760
I joined the army when I was 18 years old.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.760
As a soldier, I experienced the immense pain that war causes.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.759
For many years after, whenever I heard news reports about wars and about civil unrest,

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.329
I got upset.

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:47.700
I had nightmares. I experienced the war all over again.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:01:15.500
In December 2008, at the end of the year, I lost my job.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.500
It was quite difficult because I didn't speak English

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.500
and every job application required me to speak English.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:34.930
We lived modestly. We did have some savings, but they quickly ran out.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:44.379
When I realised we almost had no money left, I was very worried.

00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:49.379
I didn't understand why all of this was happening.

00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:55.819
I am a person who worries a lot.

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:57.819
It really was difficult.

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:10.219
I was very, very worried, but Jello was calm.

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:17.189
He reassured me and told me to trust in Jehovah.

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:26.759
Instead of focusing on our problems, we focused on our hope and shared it with others.

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:32.759
The help Jehovah gives us through our brothers and sisters is extraordinary.

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:37.759
He not only cares for our physical needs, he also cares for our feelings.

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:46.919
It was about five months before I found another job.

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:51.919
When going through hard situations, we see Jehovah's hand.

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:54.919
We see his help.

00:02:54.919 --> 00:03:00.919
So no matter what comes in the future, we are prepared to deal with it.

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:20.659
When I met Jehovah's witnesses, I realised that they can deal with bad news better with hope.

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:25.659
Isaiah 65-17, deeply touched my heart.

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:27.659
And he still does.

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:34.659
The scripture contains Jehovah's promise that the former things will not be called to mind.

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.659
This verse helped me calm down.

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:39.659
It made me feel great.

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:42.659
So I read it over and over again.

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.659
Gradually, the truths of God's words stabilise me.

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.659
They healed my mental disposition.

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:59.599
My hope counteracts negative feelings so that I can live within a peace.
