00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.690
Welcome to a new JW Broadcasting Monthly program.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.689
Here are some of the highlights for this month.

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:12.689
Have you ever felt frustrated with other people?

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:16.690
I know I have, and I'm sure you have too.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.690
This dramatization will provide reminders on what we can do to improve our Christian personality.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.690
Next, what is done by our brothers and congregations worldwide

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:33.689
to assist those who are housebound or are physically limited in other ways?

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:36.689
We have some encouraging experiences to share.

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:43.689
Also on March 23rd, millions will gather to commemorate the death of Jesus Christ.

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:48.689
Perhaps some of you have been given the privilege to prepare the bread for the memorial.

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:51.689
What is the proper way to make the bread?

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:55.689
You will find out in this instructional video.

00:00:55.689 --> 00:01:00.689
This is the March program of JW Broadcasting.

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:24.019
It's good to be alive and served Jehovah in these exciting times.

00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:26.019
Don't you agree?

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:30.019
There seems to be no end of new things happening in Jehovah's organization.

00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:36.019
Wherever we look, we see more and more improvements and refinements being made.

00:01:36.019 --> 00:01:41.019
For example, we have changes in the format of our meetings and conventions

00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:44.019
with video presentations.

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:52.019
The way we carry out our preaching work with the addition of metropolitan witnessing and the use of witnessing cuts.

00:01:52.019 --> 00:02:01.019
Our new understanding of Bible teachings, especially with regard to the events that lie ahead of us in the Great Tribulation.

00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:08.020
Just a few years ago, Hoover's could have envisioned what has been happening in recent months.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.020
Who would have thought that we would have her own broadcasting station via the Internet

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.020
or that we would make our literature available in some 800 languages?

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:27.020
Truly, the celestial chariot with Jehovah and the driver's seat is charging ahead at full speed.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.020
But how do you feel about all of this?

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.020
For me personally, I reflect on the joy I feel at the end of each convention,

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.020
whether it's a regional convention or an international one.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:48.020
Usually our hearts are filled to the brim and overflowing with joy and appreciation, aren't they?

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:57.020
Our feelings of joy echo the words of the Psalmist as recorded at Psalm 144, verse 15.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.020
There it says, Happy is the people for whom it is this way.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.020
Happy is the people whose God is Jehovah.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:18.460
But realistically, we have to admit that those feelings of joy and exhilaration do not always last.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:24.460
It usually is a shock when we go home and have to face the realities of living in this week at Old World.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:32.460
As second Timothy, three one clearly states, these are critical times hard to deal with.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:39.460
So we should be surprised if at times we find it hard to maintain a positive attitude.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:48.460
We may feel down, discouraged, disheartened and even overwhelmed by what we have to deal with.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:54.460
What can help us to maintain a positive viewpoint under such circumstances?

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.460
Well, there are many things.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.460
To start with, let's consider briefly three scriptures.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:06.460
The first one is in Psalm 16, verse 11.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.460
You make known to me the path of life.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.460
In your presence is abundant joy.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.459
There is happiness at your right hand forever.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.459
What is the lesson for us?

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.459
Count your blessings.

00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:29.459
Now the second scripture is Proverbs chapter 4 and verse 25.

00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:33.459
There it tells us your eyes should look straight ahead.

00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:37.459
Yes, fix your gaze straight ahead of you.

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:40.459
What is the point of this verse?

00:04:40.459 --> 00:04:42.459
Look to the future hope.

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:45.459
See the bigger picture.

00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:51.459
The third scripture is Ecclesiastes 4 and verse 6.

00:04:51.459 --> 00:04:53.459
There we read,

00:04:53.459 --> 00:05:00.459
better is a handful of rest than two handfuls of hard work and chasing after the wind.

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:03.459
So what do we need to remember?

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:05.459
Get enough rest.

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:10.459
We need to be careful not to allow too much TV watching or surfing the internet

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:13.459
to rob us of necessary rest and sleep.

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:18.459
Now these are just three of many things we need to keep in mind.

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:24.459
Another way to stay positive involves reading accounts recorded in the Bible.

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:27.459
When we look to the biblical record,

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:31.459
we can't help but be encouraged by the fact that the prophets of old

00:05:31.459 --> 00:05:34.459
had similar feelings to ours.

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:37.459
They were people just like us.

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:42.459
For example, let's read what James was inspired to say about the prophet Elijah.

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:47.459
This is recorded for us at James 5, verse 17,

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:53.459
where it says Elijah was a man with feelings like ours.

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:58.459
James goes on to show how prayer was of tremendous hope to Elijah

00:05:58.459 --> 00:06:01.459
and he can likewise assist us.

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:05.459
But what else do we learn from Elijah's example?

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:10.459
Remember our dramatic Bible reading that helped us relive the exciting events

00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:14.459
of the time when Elijah challenged the false prophets of Baal

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:18.459
and Jehovah proved that he is the only true God?

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:22.459
Can you imagine how faith strengthening it would have been to see fire

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:27.459
actually come out of heaven and devour the sacrifice?

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:31.459
What about the expressions on the faces of those false prophets?

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:36.459
How would you have felt if you were Elijah?

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:38.459
Then what happened next?

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:43.459
The three-and-a-half year-long drought broke with a heavy downfall.

00:06:43.459 --> 00:06:49.459
Once again proving that Jehovah is the true God and that Elijah was his prophet.

00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:53.459
Finally, Elijah outruns Ahab's chariot,

00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:59.459
running the 19 miles or 30 kilometers from Mount Carmel to Jezreal.

00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:05.459
If you were Elijah, do you think that you would have been on an emotional high?

00:07:05.459 --> 00:07:09.459
Your level of faith would have been at a peak.

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:14.459
Perhaps similar to how you feel at the end of an international convention.

00:07:14.459 --> 00:07:18.459
Remember though what happened next?

00:07:18.459 --> 00:07:23.459
The account at first Kings 19, 3 and 4 tells us

00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:29.459
that he became afraid, so he got up and ran for his life.

00:07:29.459 --> 00:07:35.459
He came to be a sheba which belongs to Judah and he left his attendant there.

00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:41.459
He went a days journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a broom tree.

00:07:41.459 --> 00:07:44.459
And he asked that he might die.

00:07:44.459 --> 00:07:47.459
He said, it is enough.

00:07:47.459 --> 00:07:51.459
Now of Jehovah take my life away.

00:07:51.459 --> 00:07:55.459
But I am no better than my forefathers.

00:07:56.459 --> 00:08:00.459
But why was Elijah now so discouraged?

00:08:00.459 --> 00:08:06.459
Notice what he said is recorded at first Kings 19 and verse 14.

00:08:06.459 --> 00:08:11.459
I have been absolutely zealous for Jehovah the God of armies,

00:08:11.459 --> 00:08:15.459
for the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant,

00:08:15.459 --> 00:08:20.459
your alters they have torn down and your prophets they have killed with the sword,

00:08:20.459 --> 00:08:25.459
and I am the only one left.

00:08:25.459 --> 00:08:29.459
Now they are seeking to take my life away.

00:08:29.459 --> 00:08:32.460
Do you sometimes feel that way?

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.460
Woe is me.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.460
I am the only one facing this type of problem.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:40.460
Nobody understands what I am going through.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:45.460
Well that thinking can undermine our positive attitude.

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.460
But what did Jehovah remind Elijah of?

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:54.460
Notice the three things listed at first Kings 19, 15 through 18.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:59.460
The first point, Jehovah told him that the problem was going to be solved.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.460
He was to anoint Jehu.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:07.460
The second point, Jehovah promised him help in the form of Elijah.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:13.460
And the third point, Jehovah also informed him that he wasn't the only one.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:17.460
There were at least 7,000 others.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:22.460
We can be sure that Jehovah cares for us, just as he cared for Elijah.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:30.860
Let's read about this in 1 Peter chapter 5 and verses 6 and 7.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:34.860
humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God,

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:41.860
so that he may exalt you in due time, while you throw all your anxiety on him,

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.860
because he cares for you.

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:49.860
Yes, Jehovah cares for us and helps us when we are discouraged,

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.860
just as he did for Elijah.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:59.860
When I look back over the years, I remember things that discouraged me and made me feel low.

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:03.860
What were some of those difficult moments in my life?

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:09.860
Well, I remember the time when, as a missionary, I nearly died of typhoid fever.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:13.860
I also remember supporting and caring for my first wife, Jenny,

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:17.860
during her 10-year battle with breast cancer.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:25.860
Then also losing the sight of my left eye because of melanoma, a form of cancer.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:29.860
Losing close friends and deaths, including Jenny,

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.860
sometimes one after the other in close succession.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:39.860
As a missionary, I had feelings of isolation,

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:45.860
and then of course the frustration that comes because of my own mistakes and weaknesses,

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:52.860
and trying to find a balance between what I want to do and what I can actually do.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.860
All those things have at times discouraged me,

00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:01.860
and I know that many of you have faced far worse challenges.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:06.860
But what can help us when we are overwhelmed by problems?

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:10.860
Well, in addition to all the things that we've already discussed,

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:17.860
we can find comfort in the words found at 1st Peter, chapter 5, verses 9 and 10.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:25.240
But take your stand against him, that is the devil, firm in the faith,

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:31.240
knowing that the same kind of sufferings are being experienced

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:36.240
by the entire association of your brothers in the world.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.240
But after you have suffered a little while,

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:45.240
the God of all underserved kindness, who called you to his everlasting glory and union with Christ,

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.240
will himself finish your training.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:54.240
He will make you firm, he will make you strong, he will firmly ground you.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:12:01.450
Yes, it's a wonderful encouragement to know that we're not alone.

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:08.450
Many of our brothers and sisters have faced similar problems and have been able to cope successfully.

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:14.450
As in Elijah's case, it is as if we're surrounded by a figurative 7,000

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:17.450
who are serving Jehovah along with us.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:24.450
But like Elijah, perhaps at times we might forget these faithful ones.

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:26.450
So what do we need to do?

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:28.450
Get to know them!

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.450
Ask them questions!

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:34.450
We may be surprised by how encouraging their answers are.

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:41.450
We may in fact discover a whole new resource to encourage and strengthen us.

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:46.450
During this program, I'm going to introduce you to some of the brothers and sisters

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:49.450
with whom I have the privilege of working.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:55.450
And I'm going to ask them what has helped them to cope with life's challenges and discouragements.

00:12:55.450 --> 00:13:02.450
Perhaps you too can do the same with the brothers and sisters in your congregation or in your circuit.

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:08.450
Now I'd like to introduce to you two of my friends with whom I work closely here in Brooklyn,

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:10.450
Isaac and Gene Murray.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:13.450
It's nice to have you both along here.

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:22.450
Now, originally, Sucky and Gene were from South Africa, but they were assigned to the United States back in 1981.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:29.450
Sucky, can we ask you, first of all, what are some of the challenges that you and Gene have faced in your life?

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:32.450
We have faced a number of challenges.

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:38.450
Two that come to mind is changing continents, going to live in another continent.

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:43.450
And when Gene was diagnosed with cancer about 10 years ago.

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:46.450
Well, they sound like difficult challenges.

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:48.450
Let's just start with that first one.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:54.450
Why was it difficult for you to move from South Africa to the United States?

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:58.450
Well, on the surface, it may sound like a simple matter.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:09.450
But when you deal with cultural issues and you take into consideration your own imperfection, flaws, lack of experience,

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.450
it can become very challenging.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:15.450
Looking back, it wasn't all that difficult.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:20.450
But in the process, we learn some wonderful lessons.

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:23.450
What would you mind telling this a few of those lessons that you learned?

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:32.450
Well, we know Jehovah's chariot is on the move, but Jehovah does not deal with these people in mass.

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:37.450
We do not behave like an army.

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:47.450
We dress the same, walk the same, go through the same routines, boot camp, demanding every last drop of blood.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:54.450
No, Jehovah deals with us very kindly and individually, personally.

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:57.450
He deals with all the issues of the universe.

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:02.450
At the same time, he deals with us as individuals.

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:09.450
Makes us think of the Israelites when they came out of Egypt and went through the Red Sea.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:16.450
There were Jehovah's people, millions of them, older people, babies, young people.

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:21.450
Bearing down on them was the military machine of Egypt.

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:27.450
Yet, Jehovah took every single one of them safely through the Red Sea.

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:33.450
Jehovah cares not only on an objective level, but personally.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:35.450
He is like a loving father.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:41.450
He is interested in our fears, our feelings of inadequacy or inability.

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:46.450
At the same time, though, he listens very carefully to us.

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:50.450
Are we willing to obey?

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:55.450
Are we willing to learn? Are we willing to listen to him?

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:58.450
And it matters to him very, very much.

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.450
The bottom line is this.

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:08.450
Jehovah God gives us the privilege to be able to say, he is our friend.

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:12.450
And for imperfect people, that is the greatest achievement.

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:16.450
To be able to say, Jehovah is my friend.

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:19.450
Copying with our own imperfections is one thing.

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:26.450
But, coping with life-threatening situations can be very difficult.

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:30.450
Well, we appreciate very much those excellent lessons you referred to.

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:35.450
But it seems that you are talking now about gene situations.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:39.450
Jean, could we just ask you, when you were diagnosed with having cancer,

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:43.450
how did you feel and how were you able to cope with that?

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:47.450
Well, it was a shock. I have to be quite frank about that.

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:52.450
And the treatments that followed were very harsh, so it made life difficult.

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:55.450
And I really came face to face with my own mortality.

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:58.450
But what helped me were two things.

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:02.450
And the first was the love and care of my brothers and sisters.

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:06.450
I felt as if they helped me, they supported me.

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:11.450
And as if Jehovah was using them to assure me that he loved me.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:14.450
Almost like he was giving me a hug through them.

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:16.450
That's how I really felt.

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:20.450
And the second thing that helped me a lot was thinking about the men and women in the Bible.

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:23.450
Because life for them was not easy.

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:25.450
It was challenging.

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:30.450
But through all their trials, they managed to grow, they managed to improve on their relationship with Jehovah.

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:33.450
And I especially loved the example of Jehovah.

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:38.450
Because he went through trials, many, many trials, that much more than I ever faced.

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:41.450
But at the end of all his trials, he said something interesting.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:43.450
May I read it?

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:45.450
Please, we'd love to hear it.

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:47.450
This is in Job 42 verse 5.

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:54.450
It says, My ears have heard about you, but now I do see you with my eyes.

00:17:54.450 --> 00:18:01.450
And Job said these words, I see you with my eyes, when he was in this physical state of sickness

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:03.450
and Jehovah hadn't cured him yet.

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:09.450
And yet he was able to move his focus from himself onto Jehovah and onto his sovereignty.

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:12.450
He realized it wasn't all about him, it was about Jehovah's sovereignty.

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:15.450
And honestly, that's a lesson I needed to learn.

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:21.450
I had to learn, it's not just all about me, it's about Jehovah's will and Jehovah's sovereignty.

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:28.450
And in addition to all these trials and learning that lesson, it's really an opportunity to grow.

00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:34.450
And the opportunity to be trained by Jehovah and opportunity to be corrected by him.

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:40.450
And yet I knew if I really loved Jehovah, I really loved him, he will never abandon me.

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:43.450
Well, those comments are so beautiful.

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:49.450
Thank you so much for being willing to share those personal insights and to help us with those lessons.

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:55.019
Well, we've really appreciated hearing that experience, haven't we?

00:18:55.019 --> 00:18:59.019
A second Corinthians 6 verse 13 says,

00:18:59.019 --> 00:19:07.019
it's good for us to open our hearts wide or widen out in our affections for our brothers and sisters.

00:19:07.019 --> 00:19:12.019
We really need one another, especially in these difficult times.

00:19:12.019 --> 00:19:18.019
In no way do we want our love for our brothers to be restricted somehow.

00:19:18.019 --> 00:19:24.019
There are many ways that we can display this aspect of our Christian personality.

00:19:24.019 --> 00:19:30.019
One way is by assisting those in our congregations who perhaps are housebound.

00:19:30.019 --> 00:19:42.019
The following experiences will highlight how being shown loving kindness has proven to some that although they're isolated, they are not forgotten.

00:19:42.019 --> 00:20:16.730
My friends and I decided to go swimming at a lake.

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:23.730
But when I dove in, I ended up hitting my head at the bottom of the lake.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:29.730
I hurt my fourth and fifth vertebrae and ended up becoming tetraplegic.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:48.119
In July 1989, I suffered a stroke and my life changed completely.

00:20:49.119 --> 00:20:55.119
I was a normal person, but with this stroke came its after effect.

00:20:55.119 --> 00:20:59.119
I can't get around without help.

00:20:59.119 --> 00:21:06.119
In 2009, my dad started to notice muscle weakness.

00:21:06.119 --> 00:21:15.119
After going to a few orthopedic doctors, because he thought it might be an orthopedic issue like a back problem or not walking correctly.

00:21:16.119 --> 00:21:20.119
He was finally referred to a neurologist.

00:21:20.119 --> 00:21:28.119
After two long years researching his illness, the neurologist diagnosed him with amiotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS.

00:21:32.119 --> 00:21:43.119
I found out about the diagnosis along with the rest of my family and it was devastating to learn that his illness is progressive, degenerative and ultimately fatal.

00:21:47.769 --> 00:21:49.769
What did we do to survive?

00:21:49.769 --> 00:21:53.769
Jehovah doesn't forget what we do for him.

00:21:53.769 --> 00:22:01.140
And I feel that Jehovah is always present in my life.

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:06.140
Right now, I have some privileges in the congregation.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:11.140
I'm a ministerial servant and I've received a few assignments.

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:18.140
The brothers are really encouraged by Fernando.

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:26.140
Because even though he faces some difficulties, he makes an effort to attend the meetings and give talks.

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:35.140
A brother made a stand for Fernando's computer so that even lying in his bed, he can access JW.org.

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:40.140
He can also do his research and various other jobs to fill his time.

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:46.140
A tablet holder was also made for him to use with his wheelchair.

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:51.140
I feel really grateful for the brother's help.

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:58.140
They're always interested in knowing how I am.

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:02.140
They're always trying to help me when I need it.

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:08.140
They don't just say they'll help, but they try to live up to their promises.

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:14.140
We start to feel Jehovah's presence in his help.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:19.140
And it's really worth having this help.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:22.140
The various challenges and problems Marley faces in her life,

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:25.140
she has all the reasons in the world to feel sorry for herself.

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:26.140
But she doesn't.

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:33.140
She helps others in a practical way, especially the young ones.

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.140
I didn't know how to do telephone witnessing.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:39.140
I'd never done it before, but Marley taught me how to witness over the phone.

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:44.140
She was able to help me learn a new type of witnessing.

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:51.140
It was very difficult for me to attend the meetings.

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:57.140
So the congregation set up an internet connection.

00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:03.380
And it's been a gift from Jehovah.

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:09.380
So I'm able to watch the meetings on the computer.

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:14.380
Jehovah is extremely good. He really cares for us.

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.380
He is the God of all comfort.

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:27.769
And in all this time, Jehovah has never stopped helping my family.

00:24:27.769 --> 00:24:30.769
Rather Miru is still an act of publisher in the congregation.

00:24:30.769 --> 00:24:33.769
He continues to witness to his nurses.

00:24:33.769 --> 00:24:35.769
How does he do it?

00:24:35.769 --> 00:24:39.769
Every month, his wife receives the publications, shows him all the articles.

00:24:39.769 --> 00:24:42.769
And then, during the week, he talks to the nurses.

00:24:42.769 --> 00:24:46.769
To be honest, he listens to their problems.

00:24:46.769 --> 00:24:49.769
So how does he manage to witness to them?

00:24:49.769 --> 00:24:51.769
He blinks at his wife.

00:24:51.769 --> 00:24:54.769
And he remembers the subject that he had discussed with the nurse.

00:24:54.769 --> 00:24:59.769
And he blinks to point out which publication should be given to the nurse.

00:24:59.769 --> 00:25:03.769
At the end of the month, his wife writes down how much time was spent talking

00:25:03.769 --> 00:25:05.769
and which publication was left.

00:25:05.769 --> 00:25:09.769
We've also made arrangements to record the meetings and take them to Miru.

00:25:09.769 --> 00:25:18.000
Jehovah gives us strength by means of our brothers and sisters,

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000
by means of friends who know about our struggles.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
The brothers in the congregation got together

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
and did small repair jobs around the house.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000
So it's to improve his quality of life.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
At that point, he was still able to speak and very lucid.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:42.000
And he was really grateful for these arrangements made by the brothers in the congregation.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:48.000
Loving brothers were willing to spend weeks helping out around the house.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:26:06.789
Sometimes I feel isolated, but not forgotten.

00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:12.789
It's worth putting up with everything we face.

00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:16.789
We have a wonderful hope, which is something we should never forget.

00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:21.789
And we feel like Jehovah literally carries us in his arms.

00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:31.400
What a good reminder for each of us to think about what we can do to help those

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:35.400
who are not able to attend our meetings physically.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:41.400
Now I'd like to introduce to you two of my close friends, Peter and Sue Schultz.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.400
Like me, they're originally from Australia

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.400
and now we work together at Brooklyn at the World Headquarters.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:53.400
Peter, as you realize, we've been talking about the matter of keeping

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.400
and maintaining a positive attitude.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:02.400
I know that quite a number of years ago, you and Sue and other members of your congregation

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.400
went through a traumatic experience.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:08.400
Would you mind just briefly telling us a little bit about it?

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:14.400
Yes, Jeff, we have to go back to Sunday, July 21, 1985.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:21.400
Our congregation was meeting that morning for the public talk in Sydney, Australia.

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:26.400
And during the public talk, there was a massive explosion in the Kingdom Hall.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:31.400
We learned later that a bomb had been placed underneath the platform

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:37.400
and it went off just a few feet from where the speaker was standing.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:40.400
Unbelievably, he survived.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:45.400
But when the police arrived and to their credit they got there very quickly,

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:50.400
they expected to find a Kingdom Hall full of dead bodies.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:28:00.400
But there was only the one death, a brother and very dear friend who was sitting with his family just on our left.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:04.400
When the dust and debris had settles sufficiently,

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:09.400
I actually was looking for my wife. She disappeared.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:14.400
And then I saw her boot sticking out from underneath a large ceiling bat

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.400
that had fallen to the floor.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:22.400
And so I put it aside and was shocked when I looked at her face.

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:28.400
Obviously something very solid had hit her square in the middle of this area of the face

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.400
and knocked her in her chair over backwards.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:36.400
So this whole area was very badly damaged.

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:41.400
The upper lip was severed right across and it was hanging down on her chin.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:47.400
And there was a gouge of flesh taken out of her left biceps.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:52.400
On the positive side, I was reassured to see that there wasn't much bleeding.

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:58.400
But I learned later that I was mistaken. She actually bled heavily down into a stomach.

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:03.400
So I ended up being taken to a trauma center in one hospital in Sydney.

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:10.400
I was sent to another hospital and he had to stay overnight because doctors had to operate on his arm.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:16.400
Of course, the very next morning I was eager to get to Sue.

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:23.400
So the hospital released me that morning and I went over to the hospital where Susie was staying.

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:32.400
And when I found her, Jeff, I wouldn't have recognised her face and swollen up like a melon.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:37.400
And her eyelashes, not just her eyes, but her eyelashes were buried in swollen tissue

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:41.400
where her eyes should be, were just two lines across her face.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:45.400
Of course, she couldn't see a thing which I...

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:50.400
As she went under the circumstances might have been a blessing.

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:56.400
Well, just from what you inferred there, wondering was there an issue with the blood?

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:59.400
But you mentioned it was bleeding.

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:04.400
The blood issue came up immediately when they realised that there was a lot of bleeding.

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:10.400
Whatever it hit me, artery behind the nose had either burst or been punctured.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.400
We're not sure which.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:16.400
And so the blood was running down into my stomach all that time.

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:21.400
So, of course, the hemoglobin dropped right down. It was about six.

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:28.400
So the surgeon that was assigned to me, he said, well, yes, he would do the operation to get the bones reset and all that.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:32.400
But only if I would give him the option to use blood.

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.400
So that was...

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:38.400
We tried to reason with him for many days.

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:41.400
Peter especially had quite a few sessions with him.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:46.400
But it ended up, he finally said, I'm not doing the operation.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:50.400
So at that time, it was about now 10 or 11 days.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:53.400
And for me, it was becoming critical for the face.

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:57.400
Even though all the stitching was done immediately, and that was healing up nicely.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:00.400
But the bones were in the wrong places, and now they were starting to set.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.400
You know, they needed to be put back in place.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:09.400
So at that time, I think there were no hospital liaison, or no hospital liaison arrangement.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:13.400
Peter and I felt like a couple of little duckies trying to go through uncharted waters.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:18.400
We just didn't know literally where to put our foot next, which door to knock on next.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.400
It was stressful, wasn't it, love that?

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:26.400
Yes, it was like we were walking toward a huge brick wall with no way around.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.400
No way to get past this thing.

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:33.400
And we begged Jehovah, what do we do?

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.400
How do we deal with this situation?

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:37.400
Because we had no idea.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:43.400
Anyway, just as, and knows as about to hit the wall, so to speak, a door open.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:49.400
A brother who was a general practitioner had got in touch with a plastic surgeon who said

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.400
he'd take a look at Sue and he did.

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.400
Yes, completely different attitude.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:58.400
He said, yes, I'm prepared to do this.

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:01.400
But I'll use a different procedure.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:06.400
And he felt that procedure, he would not even, you know, blood wouldn't even be an issue.

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:12.400
But he did say, I want to make sure you're him a globe and must be nine before I'm prepared to do this.

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:17.400
Well, for many days already, we had been working on getting, you know, my blood up,

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:22.400
or my blood in better condition, because we were trying to cooperate with the hospital staff

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.400
and the previous doctor as much as we could.

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:31.400
So dear friends at Bethel, each day they were using vegetable juices full of iron

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:33.400
and every night bringing them up.

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:36.400
And we'd hear the bottles rattling down the corridor, wouldn't we?

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:39.400
And we'd say he comes to jungle juice.

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:41.400
So down the straw it went.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:47.400
And when I had the blood test, the hemoglobin had already gone through nine.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.400
We were very happy.

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:55.400
So the surgeon went ahead and wiped up my jaw and put the frame, the little scaffolding on

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:58.400
and I was good to get healed.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.400
But we're so happy that that was successful.

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:06.400
But does that mean you haven't had any other problems afterwards?

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:10.400
Well, like a car that's been dinged, there's a few rattles right?

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:15.400
So my sense of smell couldn't be restored.

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.400
I had to have eardrum graphs.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.400
I wish they would grow back.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:22.400
I said, Peter's grew back and I said, how come yours grew back?

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:27.400
But anyway, I had them surgery put in.

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:33.400
Severe headaches were the problem I found for many years after the bomb.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:36.400
But I think one of the things that wears on your nerves the most,

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:40.400
and I'm sure a lot of the brothers and sisters who went through the bombing,

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:44.400
either experienced it or even still do, and that's the tinnitus,

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.400
the constant ringing buzzing in your ears.

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.400
And that hasn't stopped since the bombing.

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:56.400
So in the new system, we'll be the ones sitting out in the paddock listening to silence.

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.400
Well, thanks for explaining all that.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:04.400
But now, Peter, you mentioned too that beyond the physical problems that you were dealing with,

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:07.400
there were some other issues you had to handle.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.400
Yes.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:14.400
You could say we both suffered from what I assume was post-traumatic stress,

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.400
and nerves had taken a real beating,

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:22.400
and we were both emotionally exhausted from the whole ordeal,

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:27.400
seeing a dear brother and friend killed, just feet away from us,

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:32.400
seeing the congregation suffering, seeing what Susie went through,

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:36.400
that really took its toll on both of us.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:43.400
And just to illustrate, Sue, for years had difficulty sleeping,

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:48.400
and I had difficulty too, but Susie even more so,

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:52.400
and she began to suffer from panic attacks.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:57.400
She was always very relaxed on the platform, even at large gatherings,

00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:01.400
but now she couldn't finish reading the text comments at the Field Service Group

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.400
without running out of breath.

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:06.400
In those days, that was the custom.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.400
So I or another brother had to finish the reading.

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:14.400
Yes, Peter got used to me going, you finished.

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.400
Well, our hearts go out to you.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.400
It must have been a very difficult time.

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:22.400
There was also, you said, a question you had to grapple with in your mind.

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:25.400
Yeah, sometimes, you know, people would say,

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:34.400
why would Jehovah allow such an atrocity to be perpetrated against the congregation of his people?

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.400
Well, it's not a bad question.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:41.400
It's one that we need to answer, and how will you be able to work your way through that?

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:45.400
Well, Susie and I often tried to remind ourselves,

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:49.400
any impressive on our heart, that there are bigger issues here

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:52.400
than the preservation of our individual human lives.

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.400
There's Jehovah's sovereignty and his name,

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:58.400
and of course, the integrity of his worshipers,

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:01.400
and what are our motives for serving him?

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.400
And of course, as we know from the Bible,

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:10.400
Jehovah didn't promise that he would shield every one of us individually from physical harm.

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:15.400
In fact, Jesus even said that some of his followers would be persecuted and killed.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:21.400
And besides that, our brothers die from horrible diseases,

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:26.400
others are killed or maimed in accidents or in natural disasters.

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:29.400
That's just life in this old system, isn't it?

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:32.400
And so, Jehovah helps us,

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:39.400
and we found the biggest way in which he helps us is by giving us comfort and encouragement,

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:42.400
mainly through our dear brothers and sisters,

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:49.400
and Jehovah did that abundantly with us, especially our family and our close friends.

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:53.400
And Sue, would you like to just give us a little bit from your side as well?

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:58.400
Yes, there was an absolute outpouring of support.

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:01.400
Some of our family traveled from the other side of the country,

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:04.400
and they were with us for the first couple of weeks right there in the hospital.

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.400
That was a real comfort.

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:09.400
And our spiritual family, brothers and sisters,

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:13.400
there were bouquets of flowers coming into the hospital.

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:17.400
There seemed to be an endless stream of cards and letters.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:20.400
Some from brothers and sisters in other countries.

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:25.400
And you know, it was such a lovely weakness because quite a few of the nursing staff

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:29.400
would comment on all this, and they say, do you know all these people?

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:33.400
So we'd say, well, we don't know them, but they're our spiritual family, our brothers and sisters.

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.400
It was funny with the flowers.

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:42.400
You remember Peter was valiantly doing his man's job of caring for these flowers, trying to water them.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:46.400
The bed was like a botanic garden surrounded by flowers.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:51.400
So Pete's watering them, and one day I heard the nurse say to him, Peter,

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:54.400
I think you'll find that those flowers are watering a silk.

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.400
So we had a good laugh, but he was doing good.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.400
That's probably why we don't have him working in the garden in the vessel.

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.400
That's what it is.

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:06.400
But you know, with the cards, the words, the well chosen words

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:10.400
that brothers and sisters wrote on those cards,

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:13.400
they touched our hearts.

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:18.400
And it was like, you know, they used the expression of warm blanket put over you.

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:22.400
It was like they were right there in that hospital ward with a saying, we're right there with you.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.400
We're right behind you.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:27.400
And that was a tremendous comfort.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:33.400
But then sometimes you get, you know, the down days where you just feel totally depressed

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.400
and you're at the end of your tether.

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:38.400
And the spiritual food is so essential.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.400
And that's what Jehovah provides.

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.400
It just gets you right out of yourself.

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.400
And so, okay, focus again.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:47.400
I remember vividly one day, Peter brought it.

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.400
It was one of those down days.

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:53.400
And he had brought up the latest watchtower from Bethel.

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:59.400
And it had an article in it that he read to me about one of our precious brothers in Africa.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:04.400
He had endured brutal physical persecution.

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:10.400
And when Peter finished the article, just thinking of that brother's integrity under those circumstances,

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:16.400
his loyalty to Jehovah, you know, it stops you focusing on yourself.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.400
You say, look, stop focusing on yourself.

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.400
Look at what others are going through.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.400
It inspires you.

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.400
You say, I want to be just like that.

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:27.400
I just printed out the last little part of that article.

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.400
Please, we'd love to hear it.

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.400
This is how the article finished.

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:37.400
What helped this loyal supporter of God's Kingdom to endure brutal treatment?

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:41.400
For three months, he was entirely on his own.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.400
He fully expected to die.

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:48.400
And yet, when asked how he felt during this ordeal, his answer was,

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:51.400
I felt that Jehovah was with me all the time.

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:57.400
There were no complaints against his persecutors or lamenting over what had happened to him,

00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:02.400
just firm conviction that Jehovah never forsakes his loyal servants.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.400
Isn't that great?

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:04.400
That's inspiring.

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.400
I don't want to embarrass you both.

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:15.400
But those of us who work with you view you both as excellent examples of those that have a positive spirit,

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:17.400
a positive attitude.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:23.400
Just how can you keep a positive attitude when you've been through such a horrific, traumatic event?

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:25.400
Yes, that's a good question.

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:33.400
I can honestly say, Jeff, that if Susie and I were to stew over the horrible thing that happened to our congregation,

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:39.400
it would be very easy to become bitter or even depressed.

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:43.400
But as Jehovah's people, we have so much going for us.

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.400
We have so much help.

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:47.400
We've got Jehovah's Word.

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.400
We've got Holy Spirit.

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:52.400
We've got a wonderful hope for the future.

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:55.400
And we've got loving brothers and sisters.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:41:00.400
And we found that when you take full advantage of those precious gifts,

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:05.400
then Jehovah strengthens and comforts you and he helps you.

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:13.400
And I've seen that with Sue because when we go through trials and we take advantage of those gifts,

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:17.400
the trials actually mold us and refine us.

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.400
They don't harden us.

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:25.400
Many in the congregation, we've both seen, have been refined and molded by this experience.

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:28.400
And I've seen it with Sue.

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:35.400
I can honestly say that she's a more compassionate and understanding person as a result of what she's been through.

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:38.400
She didn't want me to say that, but I said it anyway.

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:42.400
I'm sure she'll forgive you.

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:44.400
And Sue?

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:47.400
Yes, we have tried to focus ahead.

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:53.400
And the reason is Jehovah tells us this is not the real life in his Word.

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:56.400
And Peter and I firmly believe that.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.400
The real life is ahead.

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:05.400
And anything that happens to any of us in this old system, Jehovah can undo it 110% in the new world.

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:14.400
So we tried to leave things in Jehovah's hands as to how it works out and just focus on what's coming up.

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:19.400
And in that way, we've been able to put the bombing behind us and get on with life.

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:24.400
Yeah, that has helped to give us an inner peace.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:28.400
Jehovah's hands are much bigger and much stronger than ours.

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:31.400
Well, those are some beautiful expressions.

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:38.400
Thank you both for being willing to express how you felt about those circumstances.

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:47.400
If you'd like to read the full account of their experience, it was published in the Awake magazine of January 8, 1992.

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:52.400
It's true that very few of us have had things like that happen to us.

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:57.400
But many of us have had to face a test while dealing with serious health problems.

00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:04.400
Additionally, many different traumatic events can cause us to experience a form of post-traumatic stress.

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:10.400
Hasn't this interview shown us that even though someone's experience might be different from ours,

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:16.400
we can still learn some valuable lessons from listening to their stories.

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:22.400
Peter and Sue mentioned the hope they received from the brothers and sisters and what an impact that had on them.

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:33.400
While we as individuals have great love for the brotherhood, realistically though, we all have a tendency to focus on the imperfections of others.

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:41.400
How can we look beyond those imperfections and truly benefit from the faithful examples of those serving with us?

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:51.400
In this dramatization, notice how our brother identifies what he needs to work on and how he successfully aligned his thinking with God's.

00:44:01.869 --> 00:44:07.869
I grew up in this congregation and for many years it felt like a loving family.

00:44:07.869 --> 00:44:13.869
But lately, I struggled to feel the same enthusiasm.

00:44:13.869 --> 00:44:17.869
And the elders, I struggled to understand them too.

00:44:17.869 --> 00:44:23.869
Traffic is bad after work, but they probably think that I'm slacking.

00:44:23.869 --> 00:44:30.300
They only notice their favorites, like Tulani.

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:37.789
He's got to be the slowest brother on mics.

00:44:37.789 --> 00:44:42.789
And this couple, every week, they are on the platform.

00:44:42.789 --> 00:44:58.010
Loving all the attention, I know this irritates his way too.

00:44:58.010 --> 00:45:02.010
I don't know when I started feeling this way of my congregation.

00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:07.010
But lately, I feel so disconnected from these people.

00:45:14.309 --> 00:45:20.690
I have been giving Bible reading assignments since I was his age.

00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:25.380
These are still the only assignments I get.

00:45:25.380 --> 00:46:21.300
And with each passing month, I find myself feeling more and more unhappy in this congregation.

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:28.300
Why then do you look at the straw in your brother's eye, but do not notice the rafter in your own eye?

00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:33.300
Or how can you say to your brother, allow me to remove the straw from your eye?

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:38.300
When look, a rafter is in your own eye.

00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:40.300
Hypocrite.

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:42.300
First remove the rafter from your own eye.

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:56.829
And then you will see clearly how to remove the straw from your brother's eye.

00:46:56.829 --> 00:46:58.829
Hmm, I wonder.

00:46:58.829 --> 00:47:00.829
What did Jesus mean by that?

00:47:00.829 --> 00:47:04.829
How could you fit a rafter in your eye?

00:47:04.829 --> 00:47:07.829
And how would you see anything else?

00:47:07.829 --> 00:47:15.829
How can someone with a rafter in his eye even try to remove a straw from someone else's eye?

00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:18.829
Reading the Bible can be funny sometimes.

00:47:18.829 --> 00:47:21.829
Jesus actually said,

00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:22.829
Hippocrite.

00:47:22.829 --> 00:47:26.829
First remove the rafter from your own eye.

00:47:26.829 --> 00:47:33.019
Hippocrite.

00:47:33.019 --> 00:47:37.019
Why did Jesus call this man a Hippocrite?

00:47:37.019 --> 00:47:45.829
Perhaps he was so focused on the straws, the mistakes of others.

00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:53.829
He did not see the bigger mistakes, the rafter in himself.

00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:57.829
Hmm, but that made me think.

00:47:57.829 --> 00:48:12.579
Am I a Hippocrite?

00:48:12.579 --> 00:48:15.579
I want to enjoy my service.

00:48:15.579 --> 00:48:20.579
I don't want to be negative or critical of my brothers.

00:48:21.579 --> 00:48:24.579
But how do I fix it?

00:48:24.579 --> 00:48:26.579
I prayed.

00:48:26.579 --> 00:48:30.579
I asked Jehovah to forgive me.

00:48:30.579 --> 00:48:54.760
I asked for humility too.

00:48:54.760 --> 00:49:01.760
Then I went on and asked my boss if I could leave 30 minutes early so that I could do that Bible reading.

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.760
I was surprised when he said yes.

00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:10.760
He even suggested that I could leave early every meeting night.

00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:15.760
It was like Jehovah walked into his office before I did.

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:42.230
But when Brother Kumalo commanded me, even then I thought,

00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:45.230
Is he being genuine?

00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:47.230
That's when I realized.

00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:51.230
I had to continue to remove the rafter from my eye.

00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:58.230
I have to try to view the whole congregation the way Jehovah views them.

00:49:58.230 --> 00:50:02.230
I hope to enjoy the new world with them one day.

00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:11.139
Over the months, by becoming more helpful and less critical,

00:50:11.139 --> 00:50:17.150
I feel more connected to my congregation.

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:24.150
Applying Bible principles helped me see the reality that it was my attitude that made me unhappy,

00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:29.199
not the mistakes of my brothers.

00:50:29.199 --> 00:50:36.199
All this time, the best way to change my congregation was to change myself.

00:50:36.199 --> 00:50:50.019
Focusing on the positive qualities of those around us can certainly help us to maintain a positive viewpoint.

00:50:50.019 --> 00:50:57.019
I'd like to encourage you to watch a morning worship program that is now available on video and demand.

00:50:57.019 --> 00:51:04.019
It highlights who the princes of Isaiah 32-1 are both now and in the future.

00:51:04.019 --> 00:51:09.019
Then provides a very positive message for our faithful sisters among us.

00:51:09.019 --> 00:51:13.019
That morning worship program is with Brother Kenneth Flodin,

00:51:13.019 --> 00:51:16.019
a helper to the teaching committee and is entitled,

00:51:16.019 --> 00:51:19.019
A Hiding Place from the Wind.

00:51:19.019 --> 00:51:27.260
While preparing for this program, I had the opportunity to ask many of those with whom I work

00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:32.260
about the problems they've been facing and the scriptures that have helped them to maintain

00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:36.260
a positive attitude despite adversity.

00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:40.260
I was truly amazed at how encouraging their comments were.

00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:44.260
Of course, we don't have enough time to interview all of them now,

00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:47.260
but here are some of their comments.

00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:55.260
For example, a single brother who is originally from Asia is the only member of his family who is a witness.

00:51:56.260 --> 00:52:03.260
He left his family 33 years ago because of the physical and verbal abuse he was suffering.

00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:10.260
Only recently was he able to visit his father and mother after over 30 years.

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:13.260
How can this brother remain positive?

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:21.260
He says that a traveling overseer hoped him remember the words of Psalm 27 verse 10.

00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:23.260
That reads,

00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:27.260
Even if my own father and mother abandoned me,

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:31.260
Johova himself will take me in.

00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:37.500
A single sister here at Bethel, who in addition to caring for her Bethel duties,

00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:40.500
has been hoping to care for her aged mother

00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:45.500
and her recently lost her father and death, made this comment.

00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:51.500
I learned from Dad that having the mental habit of finding reasons for thankfulness

00:52:51.500 --> 00:53:00.500
helps me to keep focused on positive things to make the joy of Johova my stronghold, even in hard times.

00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:03.500
What scripture has helped her?

00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:08.500
It's 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 and verse 18.

00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:11.500
Give thanks for everything.

00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:15.500
This is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:23.500
And finally, a dear Bethel sister who is 97 years young told me that the scripture

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:31.500
that helps her remain positive no matter what comes her way is Psalm 27 verse 14.

00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:36.500
Hope in Johova be courageous and strong of heart.

00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:39.500
Yes, hope in Johova.

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:42.500
In addition to all these fine reminders,

00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:47.500
I'm sure that we all appreciate the beautiful music that has been prepared for us.

00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:54.500
I just love the music videos that have been prepared for the monthly programs of JW Broadcasting.

00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:57.500
They're always so positive and upbeat.

00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:04.500
Even if you're feeling a little down, you can't help but smile and start humming when you hear these songs.

00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:06.500
And this month is no exception.

00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:09.500
We have yet another music video for you.

00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:14.500
This one is called Imagine the Time.

00:54:14.500 --> 00:55:30.949
There's not an egg you for this new touch my eyes grow dim with pesse.

00:55:30.949 --> 00:57:42.219
Of course, this is a very special month for all of us.

00:57:42.219 --> 00:57:47.219
It's the month when we gather together to remember the death of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:57:47.219 --> 00:57:51.219
All of us are very busy now preparing for that event.

00:57:51.219 --> 00:57:53.219
There are so many things to do.

00:57:53.219 --> 00:57:57.219
We're inviting as many as possible to join us this year.

00:57:57.219 --> 00:58:01.219
Some brothers are putting the finishing touches on their talks.

00:58:01.219 --> 00:58:05.219
Others are making sure that all the arrangements are in place.

00:58:05.219 --> 00:58:12.219
But just imagine that this year you are asked to prepare the bread for the memorial.

00:58:12.219 --> 00:58:14.219
How should you do that?

00:58:14.219 --> 00:58:18.219
What is involved in making sure that the right type of bread is used?

00:58:18.219 --> 00:58:22.219
Watch carefully as we outline the steps involved.

00:58:22.219 --> 00:58:37.860
There was something I always remembered watching my mother's hands.

00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:50.320
As she carefully prepared the bread for the memorial of Christ's death,

00:58:50.320 --> 00:59:01.840
she took it very seriously because of a special meaning on the night before his death.

00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:04.840
Jesus told his disciples,

00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:08.840
this bread means my body.

00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:12.840
After the bread and wine were passed around,

00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:14.840
Jesus said to them,

00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:18.840
keep doing this and remembrance of me.

00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:24.820
To this day, that's what we do.

00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:26.820
Shari, can you bring me the flower, please?

00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:31.760
Thank you.

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:42.250
It was a simple mixture, really.

00:59:42.250 --> 00:59:47.900
Do you remember what comes next?

00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:48.900
Water?

00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:49.900
That is right.

00:59:49.900 --> 01:00:02.889
Can you ever add anything else?

01:00:02.889 --> 01:00:09.889
No, it is very important that the bread is made in the same way as it was in Jesus' day.

01:00:09.889 --> 01:00:11.889
Just wheat, flour and water.

01:00:11.889 --> 01:00:15.460
That is all.

01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:18.460
But what if people do not have wheat flour?

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:25.460
Well, the bread can still be made with flour made from rice, barley, corn or a similar grain.

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:29.460
But nothing should be added besides the flour and the water.

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:30.460
No yeast.

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:33.460
Not even salt.

01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:35.460
Not even salt.

01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:39.460
Remember what Jesus said in Luke 1610?

01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:45.460
The person faithful in what is least is faithful also in, in much.

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:46.460
That is right.

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:50.460
And we want to be faithful to Jehovah in all things.

01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:53.440
Right?

01:00:53.440 --> 01:01:00.440
After mixing, she would need the dough and the dust would rise and fall as she worked.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:04.440
Then she would let me roll it out.

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:12.610
Then it would be placed on a lightly oiled pan for baking.

01:01:12.610 --> 01:01:17.610
When it was done, it didn't look like the kind of bread you would night typically see.

01:01:17.610 --> 01:01:23.610
It was rather plain looking, dry and cracker-like.

01:01:23.610 --> 01:01:25.610
It easily broke apart.

01:01:25.610 --> 01:01:28.860
It was perfect.

01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:32.860
And we proudly brought it to the Kingdom Hall for the observance.

01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:44.559
Happily remember those moments as I now prepare the bread for the memorial this year.

01:01:44.559 --> 01:01:54.380
But even more importantly, when I think of what Jesus did for each of us,

01:01:54.380 --> 01:02:05.489
it is a wonderful privilege to have a small contribution on this most important night of the year.

01:02:05.489 --> 01:03:29.539
That was very hopeful, wasn't it?

01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:32.539
Well, what an exciting month we have ahead of us.

01:03:32.539 --> 01:03:39.539
We look forward to unitedly joining together worldwide on Wednesday evening, March 23,

01:03:39.539 --> 01:03:44.539
to commemorate the death of our Lord Jesus and to remember the love that Jehovah showed us

01:03:44.539 --> 01:03:48.539
by providing His Son as a ransom sacrifice.

01:03:48.539 --> 01:03:56.539
On behalf of all of the governing body, we wish you Jehovah's rich blessing during this memorial season.

01:03:56.539 --> 01:04:03.539
As we come to the conclusion of our program, we have some special greetings from our brothers and sisters

01:04:03.539 --> 01:04:06.539
in the southern part of Ethiopia.

01:04:06.539 --> 01:04:11.539
This area is called Arba Minch, meaning 40 streams.

01:04:11.539 --> 01:04:15.539
The four congregations, and close to 200 publishers in this area,

01:04:15.539 --> 01:04:21.539
have a vast territory of about 200,000 inhabitants.

01:04:21.539 --> 01:04:27.539
One kingdom hole in the area, especially designed with one side that opens up

01:04:27.539 --> 01:04:31.539
so that it can be used for circuit assemblies.

01:04:31.539 --> 01:04:36.539
Because of limited internet access, some of the local pioneers are taking the lead

01:04:36.539 --> 01:04:43.539
and downloading the latest Caleb and Sophia videos for the enjoyment of many in the congregation.

01:04:43.539 --> 01:04:48.539
They also get together to watch the monthly JW broadcasting program.

01:04:48.539 --> 01:04:52.539
As is the case in congregations all over the world,

01:04:52.539 --> 01:04:57.539
the brothers and Arba Minch make sure to help older ones to get to the meetings

01:04:57.539 --> 01:05:02.539
while also training younger ones to serve the congregation.

01:05:02.539 --> 01:05:08.539
These fine kingdom publishers also make a special effort to reach unassigned territory,

01:05:08.539 --> 01:05:12.539
sometimes walking long distances.

01:05:12.539 --> 01:05:18.539
We are certain that Jehovah deeply appreciates their hard work in caring for kingdom interest,

01:05:18.539 --> 01:05:22.539
just as he does for all of you wherever you are.

01:05:22.539 --> 01:05:28.539
This is JW Broadcasting from World Headquarters in Brooklyn, New York.
