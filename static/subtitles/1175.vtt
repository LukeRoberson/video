WEBVTT

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.280
I am full-blooded turkey.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.919
We were Indians, but yet we couldn't be Indians in the white man's world.

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:15.240
And now, you're telling me I got to go fight your war.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:26.469
I was drafted during the Vietnam era when I got out of the very angry at the government.

00:00:26.469 --> 00:00:33.229
I heard about this militant group of ladies that were fighting for the rights protesting

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:50.609
was a way of letting people know that we were not going to stand for this no longer.

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:54.130
I grew up in Ireland, in a family of ten.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.969
We were Catholic and furry poor.

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.210
A sixteen, a joined army.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.370
At school, we learned all about nationalism and the 800 years of fighting between the English

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.469
and the Irish.

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:19.379
When the conflict started in Northern Ireland, that had a tremendous effect on our lives.

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:26.260
When you see something happening, you see fallen soldiers killing your people, fellow Catholics.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:53.730
I felt I had to engage and defend them against the British establishment.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.409
My wife started studying.

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:02.689
I said, they come in here on a Christian Isis and civilisis and don't bring those

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.290
Bible-toten white people around me.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.229
I don't want their religion.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.509
After Nancy started studying, she decided to get baptized.

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:18.150
So the sisters said, are you taking her to the assembly?

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.509
I don't know, I said no, I don't want to stay home.

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:26.669
So the sisters said, who's going to watch the baby while she's getting baptized?

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:29.030
I said, oh yeah, maybe I should go.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.830
The way they treated each other was respect.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.469
One wasn't on this side or the other on this side.

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:36.830
They were all together.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.349
They didn't just walk by and ignore me.

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.150
They brought people over and introduced them to me.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.310
They spoke with sincerity.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.430
I thought this is the way the world should be.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.229
This is the way people should live.

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:57.189
I'm currently serving as an elder in the Illinois River,

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:01.189
Cherokee Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:05.229
I have the privilege of teaching these ones that have moved here

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:11.930
to learn this Cherokee language so they can teach them the good news.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.849
There's no other love, no horror.

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:19.919
This love is genuine.

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:23.520
I was in a cow accident and nearly died.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:31.020
I started to drink because I couldn't cope with my situation.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.699
I did expect that my comrades in the Republican movement

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:39.460
might have come to help us.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.020
It didn't come at all.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.210
I was studying the Bible three weeks with one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.689
He was very English and his wife saw English.

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:57.289
I wouldn't have chosen them to have come into my house, but they did.

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:59.169
And they were lovely.

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.210
Nobody came to see me only at the broader.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.930
He would come regularly.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.050
That to me was a godsend.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.259
That someone cared about me.

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:16.180
And I thought, wow, everyone is fighting for justice in the war.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:37.009
Needing fight, and that went right through my heart.

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:40.569
Sometimes when I meet ex-British soldiers in the truth,

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:44.980
I said to them, we're in the same army now, bro.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.579
The only place we can find love and friendship and companionship

00:04:49.579 --> 00:04:51.980
is in Jehovah's organization.
