00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.830
Jehovah shows sincere hospitality

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.829
He cares for all without partiality

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:20.829
He gives both rain and sun

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:23.829
With holding these from none

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:30.079
He fills our hearts with food and good cheer

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.079
But we shall fade the too lowly one

00:00:34.079 --> 00:01:38.689
That is truly sincere or deep
