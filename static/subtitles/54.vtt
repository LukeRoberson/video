00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.620
Welcome to the program.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.620
We have many spiritual gems to share with you.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.619
For example, how can we build a good relationship with Jehovah

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:16.620
despite a difficult upbringing?

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.620
The story of Demetrius and Agis is very encouraging.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.620
And how can we continue to honor our marriagemate,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.620
even if he or she is an unbeliever?

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.619
Notice how Emma has learned to do just that with her husband Thomas

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:36.619
despite their differences.

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:42.619
And this month's music video highlights who really is a true friend.

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:49.619
This is the November 2018 program of J.W. Broadcasting.

00:00:49.619 --> 00:01:14.469
Our adversary, Satan the Devil, will do all he can to break our integrity

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:19.469
and destroy our friendship with Jehovah.

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:21.469
Meet Brother Victor Vinter.

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:25.469
He is a Russian brother who lives in Germany.

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:32.469
In 1958, at the age of 21, Brother Vinter was sent to a Siberian labor camp

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:36.469
simply for practicing his faith in Jehovah.

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:42.469
In total, he spent 13 years in multiple Soviet prison camps

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:45.469
and five years in exile.

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:52.469
Despite the persecution, he maintained his Christian qualities.

00:01:52.469 --> 00:02:01.939
On July 24, 1958, I got baptized.

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:10.939
And on November 5, 1958, I already got arrested for refusal to do military service.

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:16.939
The second time I was convicted was again for refusal to do military service.

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:21.939
The next court trial took place in 1963.

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.939
I got seven years and five years exile.

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:31.939
They added three years that I did not serve for refusal to go to the army.

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:36.770
I was taken to Mordovia.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.770
This was the first camp where all believers were put

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.770
amongst them 360 of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.770
The detentions were very strict

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.770
because around this time the governments and party politics changed.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:58.780
They decided that prisoners must suffer hunger.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.780
The food Russians were cut.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.780
This was very difficult, very difficult I must say.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.780
And the winters can be cold.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.780
Even in March, he could get his cold 35 degrees Celsius.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.780
Minus 35.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:24.750
Spiritual things were for all of us the brothers in this camp top priority.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.750
First of all, all 360 people were divided into four congregations

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.750
and every congregation was divided into groups.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.750
Every congregation had responsible brothers as overseers

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.750
and so had every group.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.750
We conducted the study not just once a week.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.750
We conducted the study every day, every day.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.750
And brothers took this very seriously.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.750
We had no time for any worldly thoughts.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:01.129
Every Saturday and Sunday we had a very powerful choir men's voices.

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:07.129
When we were singing, we stationed guards near the oversight house

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:10.129
where supervisors were on duty.

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:15.129
And if one of them came out, it was signalled from one brother to the next

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:21.129
so that if he or they came closer, we would already be gone.

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:26.129
But the most interesting thing was we were singing in the zone.

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:28.129
We were the prisoners.

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:31.129
But our listeners were outside.

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:34.129
They were sitting up in the trees.

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:39.129
The children of the supervisors, officers and guards.

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:43.379
And they were listening to our choir.

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:48.379
All together during that time, I was in seven prison camps.

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:56.810
I spent about 13 years there and another five years in exile in Siberia.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.810
But when I was convicted the last time,

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.810
the head of the interrogation department came into my cell and said,

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.810
Victor, when you finish all your prison terms, you will have nothing at all.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.810
No family, no children.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.810
I smiled at him and asked,

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.810
how do you know this citizen Lieutenant Colonel?

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.810
I don't know it either.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.810
But I do trust in Jehovah.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:28.120
Today I do have a family and do have my wife, my children.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.120
We continue to serve Jehovah.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:36.620
And my greatest joy is when my six-year-old granddaughter

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:42.620
stands next to me in the Kingdom Hall and sings songs that praise Jehovah.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:48.899
Well, to make it simple, I would put it this way.

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:52.899
Preserve your love for Jehovah and for your brothers.

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:55.899
Joy in Jehovah's service.

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:57.899
Never lose it.

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:00.899
We will not fear anything bad.

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:03.899
Neither cold nor hunger.

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:04.899
Nothing.

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:12.850
Did you notice the evil words of the head of the interrogation department?

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.850
You will have nothing at all.

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.850
No family, no children.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.850
Today, Brother Vinter is over 80 years old.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.850
What a blessing.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:29.850
As you can see that he is now surrounded by a big family.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:34.850
By maintaining his theocratic routine, even under persecution,

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:39.850
Brother Vinter avoided developing bitter feelings toward his persecutors.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:45.850
In this way, he maintained his relationship with Jehovah

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:50.850
and he conquered the evil with the good.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:54.850
And that is also the theme for this month's program.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:59.850
Keep conquering the evil with the good.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:06.850
This challenging exhortation was written by the Apostle Paul at Romans 1221.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:12.850
It's challenging because we live in a world that is alienated from God and the truth.

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:17.850
A world that tries to squeeze everyone into its mold.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:24.850
Isaiah 520 shows how the world has changed God-given standards.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.850
It reads,

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:32.850
Wall to those who say that good is bad and bad is good.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:38.850
Those who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness.

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:43.850
Those who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter.

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:47.850
By adhering to the standard of healthful words in the scriptures

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:51.850
and to the examples of faithful servants of the past,

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:55.850
we can conquer the evil with the good.

00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:01.850
The faithful man, Inak, was born when Adam was about 600 years old,

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:07.850
which means that Inak and Adam were contemporaries for about 300 years.

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:14.850
However, there is no record of any contact between them during that period of time.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:22.850
The scriptures indicate that violence and hate for God were widespread in that pre-flood world.

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:28.850
Many centuries later, the disciple Jude describes the fear-inspiring prophecy

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:33.850
that God gave to Inak about Jehovah coming with his holy myriads,

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:40.850
legions of mighty angels in battle array to bring destruction to all the ungodly.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:46.850
Inak fearlessly went about declaring the coming judgment and destruction

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:51.850
and what is more, he did it alone.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:56.850
The prophecy was fulfilled in the global deluge

00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:02.850
and it set the pattern of a greater destruction yet to come.

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:10.850
No wonder that Genesis 524 tells us that Inak kept walking with the true God.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:15.850
Inak's example gives us courage to remain firm for true worship,

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:20.850
even if family and friends stand apart from us.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:26.850
Inak did not try to fit in with the evil crowd of the pre-flood world

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:32.850
and we don't want to fit in with the present dying world and its evil ways.

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:39.850
We may feel alone at times, but we are reminded that Jehovah never abandoned Inak

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:44.850
and neither will he abandon his faithful servants today.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:53.850
We imitate Inak by not allowing the evil surrounding us to undermine our faith in Jehovah.

00:09:53.850 --> 00:10:00.850
Like Inak, we can conquer the evil with the good by avoiding bad associations,

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:05.850
sticking close to Jehovah God on the earthly part of his organization

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:11.480
and boldly proclaiming the good news.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:17.480
Elisha the prophet refused to engage in paying evil for evil,

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.480
even when it seemed justified.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:27.480
The account is found at 2 Kings, chapter 6, verses 14 to 23.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.480
Syria was at war with Israel.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:35.480
The king of Syria was enraged because Elisha was able to foresee

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:41.480
wherever it was that Syria was planning to ambush the Israelites.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:49.480
Elisha would warn the king of Israel and he in turn would keep his troops away from the place of ambush.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:57.480
The king of Syria became exasperated and wanted desperately to take the prophet Elisha captive

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.480
to stop him from warning the king of Israel.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:08.480
It came about that the king of Syria learned that Elisha was in the city of Dothan.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:15.480
So all the kings sent horses, war chariots, as well as a large army to surround Dothan by night

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.480
in order to take Elisha captive.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:26.480
The following morning, Jehovah listened to Elisha and did something amazing.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.480
He struck the Syrian troops with the temporary form of blindness.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:36.480
And Elisha guided all those troops, not back to Syria,

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.480
but to Samaria where the king of Israel resided.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:46.480
The king of Israel was anxious to strike down and kill the Syrian troops.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:54.480
But Elisha said to him as recorded in verses 22 and 23 of 2 Kings, chapter 6.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:03.480
You must not strike them down. Do you strike down those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow?

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:09.480
Give them bread and water so they may eat and drink and return to their Lord.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:19.480
So he spread a great feast for them and they ate and drank, after which he sent them away to return to their Lord.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:27.480
What a shock this must have been to the Syrian soldiers who likely thought that they were as good as dead.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:33.480
This astounding turn of events was far better than paying evil for evil.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.480
How do we know it was better?

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.480
The latter part of verse 23 says,

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:47.480
And not once did the marauder bands of the Syrians come again into the land of Israel.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:53.480
Can you imagine the men of the Syrian army relating to their king what had taken place?

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:57.480
They went out to take Elisha captive.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:04.480
However, Elisha with the help of Jehovah Spirit had taken the Syrians captive without a battle.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:09.480
The Syrian king must have been dumbfounded when he heard the report.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:14.480
And you can be sure that the soldiers of the Syrian army were not only grateful,

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:21.480
but they acquired a very respectful fear of Jehovah and of his prophet Elisha.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:27.480
The good done to the Syrians would not be soon forgotten.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:36.480
Like Elisha, we want to do what is good for people, including those who do not view us favorably.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:41.480
When tragedies such as fires, floods, earthquakes, and hurricanes strike,

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:46.480
we go out of our way to comfort people with the Scriptures.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:56.480
Also, Jehovah's Witnesses serving as relief workers are well known for the practical assistance they render to fellow believers and to others.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:02.480
As a result, many people have changed their view of us and have come to appreciate

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:10.789
that in these last days, Jehovah does indeed have a people for his name on the earth.

00:14:10.789 --> 00:14:15.789
At 2 Timothy 2 verses 23 through 25,

00:14:15.789 --> 00:14:21.789
the Apostle Paul encourages us to display qualities that make us different from the world.

00:14:21.789 --> 00:14:27.789
He says, further, reject foolish and ignorant debates,

00:14:27.789 --> 00:14:34.789
knowing that they produce fights. For a slave of the Lord does not need to fight,

00:14:34.789 --> 00:14:42.789
but needs to be gentle toward all, qualified to teach, showing restraint when wronged,

00:14:42.789 --> 00:14:47.789
instructing with mildness those not favorably disposed.

00:14:47.789 --> 00:14:56.789
And then Paul explains the desired result. Perhaps God may give them repentance leading to an accurate knowledge of truth.

00:14:57.789 --> 00:15:02.789
Paul was gentle toward all and qualified to teach.

00:15:02.789 --> 00:15:09.789
He showed restraint when he was imprisoned by the Roman authorities around 60 or 61 CE.

00:15:09.789 --> 00:15:16.789
He spent about two years under house arrest and Rome, perhaps even being chained to a guard.

00:15:16.789 --> 00:15:20.789
He had done nothing to merit imprisonment.

00:15:21.789 --> 00:15:25.789
However, he did not dwell on the evil done to him,

00:15:25.789 --> 00:15:31.789
and he did not allow it to make him bitter and resentful of Roman authorities.

00:15:31.789 --> 00:15:39.789
Rather, in Philippians 1 verses 12 through 14, Paul wrote,

00:15:40.789 --> 00:15:48.789
Now I want you to know, brothers, that my situation has actually turned out for the advancement of the good news,

00:15:48.789 --> 00:15:56.789
so that my prison bonds for the sake of Christ have become public knowledge among all the Praetorian guard and all the rest.

00:15:56.789 --> 00:16:02.789
Now, most of the brothers in the Lord have gained confidence because of my prison bonds,

00:16:02.789 --> 00:16:07.789
and they are showing all the more courage to speak the word of God fearlessly.

00:16:07.789 --> 00:16:12.789
In his letter to Titus, at chapter 3 verses 1 and 2,

00:16:12.789 --> 00:16:18.789
Paul gives reminders on how Christians today can conquer the evil with the good

00:16:18.789 --> 00:16:24.789
by showing proper respect for governmental authorities wherever we may live.

00:16:24.789 --> 00:16:27.789
He writes,

00:16:27.789 --> 00:16:36.789
Continue reminding them, fellow Christians, to be in subjection and to be obedient to governments and authorities.

00:16:37.789 --> 00:16:43.789
To be ready for every good work, to speak injuriously of no one,

00:16:43.789 --> 00:16:52.789
not to be quarrelsome, but to be reasonable, displaying all mildness toward all men.

00:16:52.789 --> 00:16:56.789
Paul followed his own advice.

00:16:56.789 --> 00:17:04.789
While in custody in Rome, Paul wrote inspired letters to Christian congregations in Greece and Asia Minor,

00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:08.789
and we today benefit from the council in those letters.

00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:15.789
Never do we read in his letters criticism aimed at human rulers or encouragement for Christians

00:17:15.789 --> 00:17:20.789
to favor one political figure or party over another.

00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:23.789
He was no part of the world,

00:17:23.789 --> 00:17:29.789
and he knew that man's only hope was the kingdom of God.

00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:36.789
Paul was a spiritual man, and he conquered the evil with the good

00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:40.789
by following Jesus' instructions at Mark 12-17,

00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:43.789
of giving Caesar's things to Caesar,

00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:46.789
but God's things to God,

00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:51.789
all the while displaying a mildness that belongs to wisdom.

00:17:51.789 --> 00:17:56.099
At first Peter, 221,

00:17:57.099 --> 00:18:02.099
we receive further direction about the course that we are to follow.

00:18:02.099 --> 00:18:04.099
Peter writes,

00:18:04.099 --> 00:18:08.099
In fact, to this course you were called,

00:18:08.099 --> 00:18:11.099
because even Christ suffered for you,

00:18:11.099 --> 00:18:15.099
leaving a model for you to follow his steps closely.

00:18:15.099 --> 00:18:20.099
Some of Christ's steps are enumerated in verses 22 and 23,

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:22.099
where it reads,

00:18:22.099 --> 00:18:26.099
he, Jesus, committed no sin,

00:18:26.099 --> 00:18:29.099
nor was deception found in his mouth.

00:18:29.099 --> 00:18:31.099
When he was being insulted,

00:18:31.099 --> 00:18:34.099
he did not insult in return.

00:18:34.099 --> 00:18:36.099
When he was suffering,

00:18:36.099 --> 00:18:38.099
he did not threaten,

00:18:38.099 --> 00:18:43.099
but he entrusted himself to the one who judges righteously.

00:18:43.099 --> 00:18:48.099
Jehovah is the one who judges righteously.

00:18:48.099 --> 00:18:53.099
However, the Jewish religious leaders did not judge the Christ righteously.

00:18:53.099 --> 00:18:56.099
They insulted Jesus frequently,

00:18:56.099 --> 00:18:59.099
and even accused him of having a demon.

00:18:59.099 --> 00:19:04.099
Jesus did not stoop to return evil for evil,

00:19:04.099 --> 00:19:08.099
hurling insults or threatening people.

00:19:08.099 --> 00:19:15.099
Insults and threats do not open hearts to accept the good news.

00:19:15.099 --> 00:19:17.099
When Jesus was on trial,

00:19:17.099 --> 00:19:23.099
the Jewish religious leaders spurred the crowd on to cry out for his execution.

00:19:23.099 --> 00:19:30.099
The Roman authorities had Jesus nailed to a torture stake to suffer a cruel and excruciating death.

00:19:30.099 --> 00:19:33.099
While suffering on the torture stake,

00:19:33.099 --> 00:19:36.099
what did Jesus speak about?

00:19:36.099 --> 00:19:42.099
Did he curse the Roman soldiers who had mistreated him and were now executing him?

00:19:42.099 --> 00:19:44.099
To the contrary,

00:19:44.099 --> 00:19:47.099
he conquered the evil with the good.

00:19:47.099 --> 00:19:54.099
Among Jesus' last words are those recorded at Luke 2334.

00:19:54.099 --> 00:19:57.099
Father, forgive them,

00:19:57.099 --> 00:20:00.099
for they do not know what they are doing.

00:20:00.099 --> 00:20:05.099
Jesus knew that the Roman soldiers were ignorant of who he really was

00:20:05.099 --> 00:20:08.099
and did not know what they were doing.

00:20:08.099 --> 00:20:13.099
He could forgive them with the hope that they would eventually respond to the truth

00:20:13.099 --> 00:20:16.099
and become his disciples.

00:20:16.099 --> 00:20:18.099
In every respect,

00:20:18.099 --> 00:20:21.099
Jesus conquered the evil with the good,

00:20:21.099 --> 00:20:25.099
and he always displayed complete confidence

00:20:25.099 --> 00:20:30.099
in the one who judges righteously, Jehovah God.

00:20:30.099 --> 00:20:35.099
We want to demonstrate the same kind of confidence in Jehovah

00:20:35.099 --> 00:20:39.099
and in His Word that Jesus displayed.

00:20:39.099 --> 00:20:42.099
We do our best to imitate the Christ

00:20:42.099 --> 00:20:50.099
by applying the Spirit-inspired counsel at Romans 12 verses 17 and 18.

00:20:50.099 --> 00:20:55.099
Return evil for evil to no one.

00:20:55.099 --> 00:21:00.099
Take into consideration what is fine from the viewpoint of all men.

00:21:00.099 --> 00:21:04.099
If possible, as far as it depends on you,

00:21:04.099 --> 00:21:07.099
be peaceable with all men.

00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:14.099
Heating this counsel is particularly important in homes that are religiously divided.

00:21:14.099 --> 00:21:22.099
The Christian maid resists the temptation to repay an unkind word or act with another unkindness.

00:21:22.099 --> 00:21:27.099
Really, no good comes from returning evil for evil.

00:21:27.099 --> 00:21:33.099
On the contrary, such an attitude can only aggravate the situation.

00:21:33.099 --> 00:21:38.099
In the domestic setting, a wife who shows genuine kindness to her husband

00:21:38.099 --> 00:21:42.099
after he makes unpleasant comments about her beliefs

00:21:42.099 --> 00:21:48.099
may well diffuse a potentially explosive situation.

00:21:48.099 --> 00:21:56.099
At Proverbs 31-12, we are told how a capable God-fearing wife deals with her husband.

00:21:56.099 --> 00:22:03.099
She rewards Him with good, not bad, all the days of her life.

00:22:03.099 --> 00:22:09.099
Additionally, by taking into consideration what is fine from the viewpoint of all men,

00:22:09.099 --> 00:22:12.099
Jehovah's people have often overcome prejudice

00:22:12.099 --> 00:22:17.099
by providing practical assistance to their neighbors as opportunity affords

00:22:17.099 --> 00:22:21.099
and particularly when a disaster strikes.

00:22:21.099 --> 00:22:26.099
We conscientiously adhere to Romans 12-19,

00:22:26.099 --> 00:22:28.099
which states,

00:22:28.099 --> 00:22:31.099
do not avenge yourselves beloved,

00:22:31.099 --> 00:22:35.099
but yield place to the wrath for it is written.

00:22:35.099 --> 00:22:37.099
Vengeance is mine.

00:22:37.099 --> 00:22:41.099
I will repay, says Jehovah.

00:22:41.099 --> 00:22:49.099
The footnote on verse 19 shows that Paul is telling us to yield to God's wrath or anger.

00:22:49.099 --> 00:22:52.099
Jehovah is the one who will set matters straight,

00:22:52.099 --> 00:22:57.099
and he will do it much better than we ever could.

00:22:57.099 --> 00:23:00.099
As James 1-20 states,

00:23:00.099 --> 00:23:05.099
man's anger does not bring about God's righteousness.

00:23:05.099 --> 00:23:13.099
The theme of this discussion is summarized exquisitely at Romans 12-20 and 21

00:23:13.099 --> 00:23:18.099
with this direction to all of Jehovah's people.

00:23:18.099 --> 00:23:22.099
But if your enemy is hungry, feed him.

00:23:22.099 --> 00:23:27.099
If he is thirsty, give him something to drink.

00:23:27.099 --> 00:23:32.099
For by doing this, you will heap fiery coals on his head.

00:23:32.099 --> 00:23:36.099
Do not let yourself be conquered by the evil,

00:23:36.099 --> 00:23:42.349
but keep conquering the evil with the good.

00:23:42.349 --> 00:23:48.349
Let's now turn to a modern-day example of conquering evil with good.

00:23:49.349 --> 00:23:58.349
In South Korea, 19,000 of our brothers have at some point been imprisoned for their Christian neutrality.

00:23:58.349 --> 00:24:04.349
But inside the prison walls, our brothers have the support of their fellow Christians.

00:24:04.349 --> 00:24:11.349
We met a group of brothers who still cherished the friendships they developed while imprisoned,

00:24:11.349 --> 00:24:20.859
although it's been about 40 years since their release.

00:24:20.859 --> 00:24:27.809
When I was 21 years old,

00:24:27.809 --> 00:24:31.809
I was sent to prison in the Nonsan Military Training Center

00:24:31.809 --> 00:24:36.920
because I refused to serve in the military.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:40.920
The soldier working in the military prison came and started to beat me,

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:45.900
and he beat me relentlessly.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:49.900
It was late December 1975.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:53.900
Four of the brothers were put into standing solitary confinement cells,

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.900
called Dokgochang.

00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:02.920
It literally feels like you're in a coffin.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:06.920
The outside temperature dropped to minus 13 degrees Celsius,

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:13.349
and cold air seeped out from the wet walls.

00:25:13.349 --> 00:25:17.349
The brothers couldn't lay down to sleep, so they had to crouch.

00:25:17.349 --> 00:25:23.299
And I could hear them groaning all night.

00:25:23.299 --> 00:25:28.299
I extended my hand through the iron bars to the brother in the cell next to mine,

00:25:28.299 --> 00:25:30.299
and he did the same.

00:25:30.299 --> 00:25:34.299
We held hands and encouraged each other to stay strong.

00:25:34.299 --> 00:25:43.220
My health condition wasn't really good while serving my prison sentence.

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:49.220
I weighed about 47 kilograms, and without my family support,

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:52.220
I was mentally and physically weak.

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:56.220
Under these extremely difficult circumstances,

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.220
there were times I wasn't able to eat at all.

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:05.220
During those times, the brothers provided me with porridge which was easy to digest,

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:10.220
warm clothing, and a sleeping bag for the winter.

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:14.890
I could really feel their love.

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:20.890
Having been to prison three times, I truly feel that Jehovah showed interest in me,

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:25.890
and took care of me just as he promised in 1st Peter 5.7.

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:31.890
He especially supported me through my brothers when I was facing difficulties.

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:39.890
A day in the prison started with eating breakfast and then moving 300 bricks.

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:44.890
After lunch, we would have to carry another 300 bricks.

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:50.890
Because I usually finished my work early, I had a 20 minute break before going back in.

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:57.890
However, this brother named Park Kyung-man, who was much stronger and bigger than I was,

00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:00.890
carried bricks all day long.

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:06.890
I found out later that Park Kyung-man was carrying chess on Q's share of bricks

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:09.890
because of his frail health.

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:15.890
This kind of brotherly love really moved me to start studying the Bible.

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:22.890
I got baptized a year later in April of 1977 in the Ann Young Prison.

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:29.890
After getting baptized, my mother passed away, and two months before being released,

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:32.890
my father passed away as well.

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:36.890
So that time was especially difficult for me.

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:41.890
But the brothers encouraged me with their warm words and kind gestures.

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:47.890
Their encouragement really touched me and helped me to endure until I was released.

00:27:53.799 --> 00:27:56.799
One time, I had a severe stomach ache.

00:27:56.799 --> 00:28:02.799
The symptoms were not getting any better with the medication I was given,

00:28:02.799 --> 00:28:06.799
so I was having a very difficult time.

00:28:06.799 --> 00:28:11.799
One day, we would serve some vegetables as a side dish.

00:28:11.799 --> 00:28:18.799
And one brother, he crushed and squeezed the vegetables to make juice for me.

00:28:18.799 --> 00:28:21.799
He cared for me that way for several days.

00:28:21.799 --> 00:28:28.799
I really would like to see that self-sacrificing and loving brother once again.

00:28:28.799 --> 00:28:35.799
At the time, none of our publications other than the Bible were allowed into the prison.

00:28:35.799 --> 00:28:38.799
Of course, that includes our songbook.

00:28:38.799 --> 00:28:44.799
The brothers memorized the lyrics from the songbook, and it would write them down.

00:28:44.799 --> 00:28:49.799
Also, there were some songs that were sung at the regional convention.

00:28:49.799 --> 00:28:51.799
Songs like...

00:28:51.799 --> 00:29:25.920
We sang them silently together, even in this isolated place.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:30.920
It was a great source of encouragement to share the love among our fellow brothers.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:36.920
I remember this encouraging scripture from 1 Corinthians chapter 10 verse 13.

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:45.920
It says that Jehovah does not let us be tempted beyond what we can bear and will make the way out so we may endure it.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:53.920
Although there were many challenges, I was convinced that Jehovah would always make a way out through our fellow brothers.

00:29:53.920 --> 00:30:04.230
Even though 40 years have passed, when we look back at those days, the memories are still fresh and we are moved to tears at times.

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:15.230
So to make a meaningful trip out of our 40 years of friendship, all the friends who went through the same trials decided to visit the headquarters in the United States together.

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:22.460
It's really refreshing to be here with everyone again today.

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:33.880
It feels like I'm taking a field trip.

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:45.880
I was especially moved to tears when I saw our old prison uniforms there in the museum at World Headquarters displayed in the neutrality section.

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:54.900
While on the tour, the brothers sat and laid down on the floor inside the Dokkochang.

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:59.900
And we were able to reflect on the times we spent together in prison.

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:08.069
Our gratitude to Jehovah for giving us such loyal friends was renewed.

00:31:08.069 --> 00:31:26.160
Yes, through their brotherly love and the power and strength given to them by Holy Spirit, our Korean brothers were able to conquer the evil with the good.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:34.160
Although we may not be imprisoned, having true friends can help us through many trials.

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:43.160
But what is a true friend? Where can we find them? And why are they so important?

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:50.160
Our music video will answer those questions. It is entitled True Friends.

00:32:31.430 --> 00:36:06.369
What a blessing it is to have true friends around us in the Christian congregation.

00:36:06.369 --> 00:36:14.369
But at times, our imperfection may create roadblocks between us and our dear friends.

00:36:14.369 --> 00:36:19.369
And we may start developing negative feelings about them.

00:36:19.369 --> 00:36:30.369
In this Bethel morning worship, pay attention to how brother Jeffrey Jackson of the governing body helps us deal with such thinking.

00:36:30.369 --> 00:36:37.369
Well, perhaps we could take out Bibles and turn to Colossians chapter 3 and verse 13.

00:36:37.369 --> 00:36:43.369
And let's analyze this verse together and see what is it that Jehovah expects of us.

00:36:43.369 --> 00:36:55.369
So in Colossians 3, 13, it says continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely, even if anyone has a cause for complaint against another.

00:36:55.369 --> 00:37:01.369
Just as Jehovah freely forgave you, you must also do the same.

00:37:01.369 --> 00:37:10.369
Or certainly this verse gives us plenty of food for thought, doesn't it? Are areas in which perhaps we can work on and improve in?

00:37:10.369 --> 00:37:15.369
But what two things stand out as being required of us?

00:37:15.369 --> 00:37:25.369
Well, looking back, you notice the first one, continue putting up with one another and then the second point, forgiving one another freely.

00:37:25.369 --> 00:37:30.369
Well, let's look at that first expression, continue putting up with one another.

00:37:30.369 --> 00:37:34.369
But what's the difference between these two expressions?

00:37:34.369 --> 00:37:44.369
Well, we're told that this first expression doesn't refer to serious sins, but perhaps talks about things that are irritating, annoying.

00:37:44.369 --> 00:37:55.369
Things that we may not necessarily have a cause for complaint concerning, but they still get us very upset anyway. These minor things.

00:37:55.369 --> 00:38:00.369
What are some of the things that annoy you? Let's be honest.

00:38:00.369 --> 00:38:05.369
Are you annoyed when someone is always late?

00:38:05.369 --> 00:38:08.369
Are you annoyed when they're always early?

00:38:08.369 --> 00:38:13.679
Are you annoyed when someone is outspoken?

00:38:13.679 --> 00:38:17.679
Does it annoy you when someone's too quiet?

00:38:17.679 --> 00:38:21.679
It's amazing, isn't it? What are the things that annoy us?

00:38:21.679 --> 00:38:29.679
I remember back in the 70s, Brother Norgaver, an outstanding talk where he alluded to the fact that maybe there's a sister in the congregation

00:38:29.679 --> 00:38:35.679
and she's hearing this other sister, new in the truth, answering up time after time.

00:38:35.679 --> 00:38:40.679
And in her heart, she's thinking, why doesn't she just keep quiet?

00:38:40.679 --> 00:38:43.679
Well, maybe we've all experienced those feelings.

00:38:43.679 --> 00:38:47.679
And if we're judged on them, perhaps we'll agree.

00:38:47.679 --> 00:38:53.679
Well, it's not justified. I don't really have a cause, but it still irritates me.

00:38:53.679 --> 00:38:58.679
It's true, isn't it? The expression sometimes, it's not the mountains ahead of us that cause problems.

00:38:58.679 --> 00:39:06.679
It's the pebble in the shoe. And it's sometimes the small things that irritate us the most.

00:39:06.679 --> 00:39:11.679
I remember when I was serving in Western Samoa many years ago at the branch.

00:39:11.679 --> 00:39:15.679
We had quite a number of brothers from overseas working on construction.

00:39:15.679 --> 00:39:22.679
And there was one brother who had the habit, first in the morning, as he arrived before breakfast, saying,

00:39:22.679 --> 00:39:29.679
Good morning to everyone. Some found that annoying.

00:39:29.679 --> 00:39:32.679
Maybe you can relate to that.

00:39:32.679 --> 00:39:37.679
And no doubt you feel very happy when you read the scripture in Proverbs 27, 14,

00:39:37.679 --> 00:39:45.679
where it says in one translation, a loud and cheerful greeting early in the morning is taken as a curse.

00:39:45.679 --> 00:39:48.679
You might be thinking, I meant to that.

00:39:49.679 --> 00:39:55.679
And that brother ceased his habit after he read that scripture, or at least it was read to him.

00:39:55.679 --> 00:40:03.679
But we may not always be able to find a scripture that backs up this irritation that we feel.

00:40:03.679 --> 00:40:06.679
So what do we do? Well, what does it say?

00:40:06.679 --> 00:40:13.679
Continue putting up with one another. Continue. It's something that we just have to keep on doing.

00:40:13.679 --> 00:40:20.679
That brings us to the second part of our verse, forgiving one another freely.

00:40:20.679 --> 00:40:29.679
It's interesting when we look at other translations of this verse, most follow the King James version and just say, Forgive.

00:40:29.679 --> 00:40:34.679
The New World translation says, Forgive freely.

00:40:34.679 --> 00:40:39.679
The reason is that this isn't your normal Greek word for forgiveness.

00:40:39.679 --> 00:40:46.679
It denotes generosity, a willingness to go beyond what's required.

00:40:46.679 --> 00:40:54.679
It's interesting that the watchtower, even back in 1882, was using that expression to forgive one another freely,

00:40:54.679 --> 00:40:58.679
well before the time of the New World translation.

00:40:58.679 --> 00:41:03.679
So this gives us something to think about because it's not just a matter of forgiving,

00:41:03.679 --> 00:41:11.679
but we need to be generous about forgiving. We have to be willing to, as it were, bestow a pardon

00:41:11.679 --> 00:41:15.679
on someone who really doesn't deserve that pardon.

00:41:15.679 --> 00:41:21.679
Now, why should we be interested in developing and working on these two aspects,

00:41:21.679 --> 00:41:25.679
putting up with one another and forgiving freely?

00:41:25.679 --> 00:41:29.679
Well, we've heard the reasons many times before, haven't we?

00:41:29.679 --> 00:41:32.679
The first one, of course, is that Jehovah has forgiven us.

00:41:32.679 --> 00:41:41.679
If we turn back just one chapter, chapter 2 of Colossians, and verse 13, this point is highlighted for us.

00:41:41.679 --> 00:41:50.679
It says in chapter 2, verse 13, Furthermore though, you were dead in your trespasses and in the uncircumcised state of your flesh,

00:41:50.679 --> 00:42:00.679
God made you alive together with him. He kindly forgave you all, or forgave us all our trespasses.

00:42:00.679 --> 00:42:04.679
So this is the model that Jehovah has given us.

00:42:04.679 --> 00:42:11.679
It's true. We sometimes can find some reason why we feel we don't have to forgive someone else,

00:42:11.679 --> 00:42:17.679
but remember the illustration Jesus gave of the slave who had the huge dead,

00:42:17.679 --> 00:42:24.679
if you calculated in Daenerys, there were 60 million Daenerys that he owed.

00:42:24.679 --> 00:42:30.679
He was forgiven that, then he went after the other man who owed him just a small amount.

00:42:30.679 --> 00:42:34.679
But have you ever thought, if you asked that slave, maybe he would say,

00:42:34.679 --> 00:42:39.679
well, it's true, I really appreciate having everything forgiven, but I still don't have any money.

00:42:39.679 --> 00:42:45.679
I need some money, so that's why I wanted to get the other slave to give me the money.

00:42:45.679 --> 00:42:49.679
Well, there's always a reason, isn't it? Even if it's a distorted reason,

00:42:49.679 --> 00:42:52.679
as to why we don't follow Jehovah's example.

00:42:52.679 --> 00:42:57.679
But looking back at Colossians 3, verse 13, what does it say,

00:42:57.679 --> 00:43:01.679
if anyone has a cause for complaint against another?

00:43:01.679 --> 00:43:04.679
So that gives us a good idea, doesn't it?

00:43:04.679 --> 00:43:10.679
The second reason, of course, is that we do need others to forgive us.

00:43:11.679 --> 00:43:16.679
The very things that annoy us and irritate us in others

00:43:16.679 --> 00:43:21.679
are sometimes the same things that we do to others. Have you ever noticed that?

00:43:21.679 --> 00:43:24.679
And how annoying it is when someone points that out to you.

00:43:24.679 --> 00:43:28.679
You're annoyed with that person? Don't you realize what you do?

00:43:28.679 --> 00:43:31.679
Well, that's something good for us to remember, isn't it?

00:43:31.679 --> 00:43:34.679
The fact that we do need to have others forgive us.

00:43:35.679 --> 00:43:41.679
And then another reason is that it maintains the peace within the Christian congregation.

00:43:41.679 --> 00:43:48.679
The watchtower made the comment on this. It said that in countries where our work is restricted or under ban,

00:43:48.679 --> 00:43:52.679
many of our brothers have to meet together in smaller groups.

00:43:52.679 --> 00:43:58.679
And when you do that, you get to know everyone's weaknesses, idiosyncrasies.

00:43:58.679 --> 00:44:04.679
It's so much easier to be annoyed by others when you're dealing with small groups of persons.

00:44:04.679 --> 00:44:06.679
The watchtower then made the comment,

00:44:06.679 --> 00:44:11.679
what good training it is for us now to learn how to put up with one another

00:44:11.679 --> 00:44:13.679
when we're in larger groups,

00:44:13.679 --> 00:44:17.679
because later we may need to worship Jehovah in smaller groups.

00:44:17.679 --> 00:44:22.679
So it's good training for us as we keep peace in the congregation.

00:44:22.679 --> 00:44:27.679
And what can help us? Well, there are many different things that can help us in this regard.

00:44:27.679 --> 00:44:33.679
The one point in the marginal reference you see there is First Peter, chapter 4 and verse 8.

00:44:33.679 --> 00:44:38.679
And that's where it tells us we need to have intense love for one another.

00:44:38.679 --> 00:44:41.679
Not just love, but intense love.

00:44:41.679 --> 00:44:44.679
And this word intense means full strength.

00:44:44.679 --> 00:44:48.679
Literally, it means to stretch out our love.

00:44:48.679 --> 00:44:53.679
So as we come across these things that irritate us and annoy us in life,

00:44:53.679 --> 00:44:58.679
or if we come across persons who actually do sin against us,

00:44:58.679 --> 00:45:00.679
what should we keep in mind?

00:45:00.679 --> 00:45:03.679
Continue putting up with one another.

00:45:03.679 --> 00:45:07.679
Continue freely forgiving one another.

00:45:07.679 --> 00:45:15.679
That sound advice also applies strongly in marriage when two people decide to share their lives together.

00:45:15.679 --> 00:45:18.679
Perhaps your mate is an unbeliever.

00:45:18.679 --> 00:45:23.679
Differences in belief can cause a level of friction.

00:45:23.679 --> 00:45:31.679
But how one handles or conquers the situation can bring you peace and even be a great witness.

00:45:31.679 --> 00:45:53.880
How did 15 years go by so fast?

00:45:53.880 --> 00:46:03.340
We were so young when we got married, maybe too young.

00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:06.340
We had so little in common.

00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:22.579
When I started studying the Bible,

00:46:22.579 --> 00:46:26.579
I thought Thomas would be as excited as I was to learn the truth.

00:46:26.579 --> 00:46:44.889
But every conversation we had on the subject seemed to turn into an argument.

00:46:44.889 --> 00:47:00.340
Looking back, I really wish I'd handled it better.

00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:21.300
As the years went by, he did become more open to discussion.

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:24.300
But it's been hard worshipping God alone.

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:28.300
Others in the congregation are able to serve Jehovah together

00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:33.300
and even reach out for theocratic goals like the School for Kingdom Evangelises.

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:36.300
Something I would love to do.

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:41.300
Why can't I have a husband who loves Jehovah like I do?

00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:44.300
Abigail probably felt the same way.

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:51.579
But with more reason.

00:47:51.579 --> 00:47:54.579
Her husband was a bully and a drunkard

00:47:54.579 --> 00:48:17.300
and was despised by his entire household.

00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:20.300
At that time, many marriages were arranged,

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:24.300
so Abigail had very little control over her circumstances.

00:48:26.769 --> 00:48:29.769
But her words and actions showed that she was a spiritual woman

00:48:29.769 --> 00:48:32.769
who didn't focus on what she could not control,

00:48:32.769 --> 00:48:36.139
but what she could.

00:48:36.139 --> 00:48:38.139
I determined to do the same.

00:48:38.139 --> 00:48:43.139
I meditated on Jesus' words at Matthew chapter 19, verse 6,

00:48:43.139 --> 00:48:49.000
what God has yoke together, let no man put apart.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000
To Jehovah, marriage is permanent,

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000
even my marriage to an unbeliever.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000
So instead of dwelling on changing my husband or my marriage,

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000
I focused on changing myself.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:06.000
Thomas does not love Jehovah, but he's no neighbor either.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000
He is loyal and he loves me.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.000
He is entitled to respect the Bible Command's wives to show their husbands,

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:18.000
so I'm making an effort to be more respectful and loving to him.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000
Thomas hasn't developed an interest in the truth or started studying,

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:27.000
but I have the satisfaction of knowing my God is pleased with me.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:31.000
And I have the same view of marriage that he does.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:59.369
How exciting is Thomas slowly noticing the benefits of the truth?

00:49:59.369 --> 00:50:03.369
No doubt, Emma's faithful and respectful conduct

00:50:03.369 --> 00:50:08.369
has had a deep impact on how he views Jehovah.

00:50:08.369 --> 00:50:12.369
And the truth can really change a person.

00:50:12.369 --> 00:50:18.369
Getting to know Jehovah can help someone to get their life back on track.

00:50:18.369 --> 00:50:23.369
Two fleshly brothers, Dimitris and Agis Sotiropoulos,

00:50:23.369 --> 00:50:27.369
are good examples of how the good can conquer the evil

00:50:27.369 --> 00:50:30.369
despite a challenging upbringing.

00:50:30.369 --> 00:50:39.690
My father was a self-made factory owner.

00:50:39.690 --> 00:50:44.690
He started a business working with rubber and plastics.

00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:48.690
And we led a financially comfortable way of life.

00:50:49.690 --> 00:50:54.690
But in the middle of the 1970s, things started going badly with his work.

00:50:54.690 --> 00:50:59.690
For this reason, he fell into a depression and he committed suicide.

00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:05.019
This was a great shock.

00:51:05.019 --> 00:51:09.019
I went to the wall and wrote the words, he lives.

00:51:09.019 --> 00:51:17.519
I didn't want to believe that from that day on, I wouldn't see my father again.

00:51:17.519 --> 00:51:24.519
At the age of about 10, I began to develop strong anti-religious tendencies.

00:51:24.519 --> 00:51:29.519
And later at the age of 17, I also expressed it by participating

00:51:29.519 --> 00:51:35.519
in the most important incident of the student movement against the military junta

00:51:35.519 --> 00:51:38.519
that was prevailing in Greece and ruling the country.

00:51:38.519 --> 00:51:43.860
I became a member of the Communist Party.

00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:48.860
I went to Santorini and started a business. I opened a bar.

00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:54.860
Of course, all this included unsavory things like immorality, drugs,

00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:58.860
and plenty of alcohol.

00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:01.860
A few months later, I left to study in Germany.

00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:05.860
It was the first time I met a brother engaging in street work.

00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:09.860
People would approach him and some would swear, some even spat at him.

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:15.860
It impressed me immensely how he stood calmly and accepted this treatment.

00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:18.860
We had interesting conversations.

00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:24.860
My studies ended and I returned to Greece to take on the responsibility of the factory.

00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:31.860
When I finished my studies in Germany, I left with a sense of deep respect for Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:39.690
The influence through my friends led me to go in the military.

00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:42.690
And there I saw a huge amount of corruption.

00:52:42.690 --> 00:52:47.690
The hope I had that we humans would be able to succeed without external help,

00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:50.690
without God, began to collapse.

00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:57.690
And then the things I had heard from Jehovah's Witnesses suddenly came to my mind.

00:52:57.690 --> 00:53:04.690
The same afternoon, I sought out a family friend, the mother of a childhood friend named Lily.

00:53:04.690 --> 00:53:09.690
I said to her, please give me a Bible and some Bible study publications.

00:53:09.690 --> 00:53:12.690
Because I want to study it, I read everywhere.

00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:17.690
And anything that I didn't understand, I wrote down in a notebook.

00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:24.690
I got to the point in just a few days where I had written down 80 to 90 questions.

00:53:24.690 --> 00:53:30.690
Harry impressed me because every time I asked him a question, he gave me the answer from the Bible.

00:53:31.690 --> 00:53:34.690
That convinced me that I had found the truth.

00:53:34.690 --> 00:53:41.690
So in that moment, I decided to leave the military and to quit smoking.

00:53:41.690 --> 00:53:46.690
A few months passed by, where I was occupied mostly with the factory.

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:54.690
Until I recognized that for me to make progress in the truth, I had to sell my shares in the factory.

00:53:54.690 --> 00:53:59.690
And on July 7, 1984, I was baptized.

00:53:59.690 --> 00:54:11.150
The authorities, the police, the mayor, the health inspectors began to demand money so that I could keep the bar open.

00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:17.150
I refused all the things they asked of me, and so the war became harder.

00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:25.150
Until one night, when I went to open the door to enter my home, I heard a trumping from behind.

00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:30.150
I tried to turn and see, and as I turned, I was hitting the face.

00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:39.510
During that time, when all of this was happening, my brother Dmitrius arrived.

00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:42.510
As brothers, we never really had a relationship.

00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:48.510
When he came to Santorini and began to talk to me and help me understand what was happening to me,

00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:52.510
I realized that this was a different Dmitrius.

00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:56.510
I said to him, I want us to start studying the Bible together.

00:54:56.510 --> 00:55:01.510
I had the Bible with me almost everywhere I went, so that I could read it.

00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:06.510
I realized that Jehovah was helping me to understand what I was living for.

00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:14.510
He was helping me to understand that I could have a real goal, a purpose, and hope.

00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:18.510
On the day of my baptism, I felt that I was drawing closer to Jehovah.

00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:25.360
I felt like my smile went from ear to ear.

00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:32.019
And now with Lydia, I have the great joy of serving in the Romani territory.

00:55:32.019 --> 00:55:35.019
We enjoy very nice Bible studies.

00:55:35.019 --> 00:55:42.019
It is truly something that shows you Jehovah's love, interest, and affection.

00:55:42.019 --> 00:55:47.019
Things that I had felt many years ago when I studied with my brother.

00:55:47.019 --> 00:55:51.019
Today, my brother and I love each other very much.

00:55:51.019 --> 00:55:59.019
It is a relationship characterized by brotherly love, as it is expressed in the Bible.

00:55:59.019 --> 00:56:02.019
We are very close to each other.

00:56:02.019 --> 00:56:04.019
This is really a change.

00:56:04.019 --> 00:56:07.019
Now we are truly brothers.

00:56:07.019 --> 00:56:18.130
Today, both Demetrius and Agis serve as elders and have spent many years in the full-time ministry.

00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:24.130
Have you noticed the many ways we have seen the good conquer the evil in this month's broadcast?

00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:32.130
Our brothers in Korea were able to endure unjust imprisonment with the support of their fellow believers.

00:56:33.130 --> 00:56:41.130
Victor Vinter, who was also imprisoned, conquered the evil by maintaining a theocratic routine.

00:56:41.130 --> 00:56:47.130
Our music video helped us appreciate the value of our true friends in the congregation,

00:56:47.130 --> 00:56:51.130
who will help us fulfill our ministry in this wicked world.

00:56:51.130 --> 00:57:01.130
Also, brother Jackson shared principles to help us overcome negative feelings we may have about others as a result of our imperfection.

00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:09.130
Over time, Emma learned to apply those principles in dealing with her unbelieving husband, Thomas.

00:57:09.130 --> 00:57:17.130
And finally, the truth conquered the evil when the Sotoropolis brothers were able to clean up their lives.

00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:21.130
Before we conclude, we have an announcement to make.

00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:26.130
You will be happy to know that the next installment of the video series

00:57:26.130 --> 00:57:37.130
was it designed, entitled The Sea Horses Tale, is available on video on demand and JW.org starting this month.

00:57:37.130 --> 00:57:42.130
Perhaps you can watch it during your next family worship evening.

00:57:42.130 --> 00:57:46.130
Let's also briefly visit our brothers and sisters in Portugal.

00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:55.130
As the most Western country and continental Europe, Portugal is known as the place where the land ends and the sea begins.

00:57:55.130 --> 00:58:03.130
mainland Portugal has over 800 kilometers or over 500 miles of Atlantic coast.

00:58:03.130 --> 00:58:10.130
In the southern part of the country, they have over 3,000 hours of sunshine per year.

00:58:10.130 --> 00:58:17.130
Portugal became world-renowned as a seafaring nation with colonies around the world.

00:58:17.130 --> 00:58:28.130
In the 15th century, navigators and explorers from Portugal traveled to distant places such as Brazil, India, and many parts of Africa.

00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:40.130
The good news reached Portugal in 1925, but the work was either restricted or under ban from 1926 to 1974.

00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:47.130
However, the brothers and sisters were good examples of conquering the evil with the good.

00:58:47.130 --> 00:58:56.130
Despite the restrictions and persecution, they continued to preach and gather together to worship Jehovah.

00:58:56.130 --> 00:59:09.130
When the witnesses gained legal recognition in 1974, the country reported about 13,500 publishers and almost 40,000 attended the first public meeting.

00:59:10.130 --> 00:59:23.130
Today, the country reports some 49,500 publishers and the ratio of one publisher to about 200 people, one of the lowest ratios in Europe.

00:59:23.130 --> 00:59:30.130
The ratio is even lower in Almada, which is across the Tegas River from the capital city Lisbon.

00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:41.130
In Almada, there are 16 congregations with almost 1,400 publishers in total, with a ratio of one publisher to about 100 residents.

00:59:41.130 --> 00:59:51.130
Many of the brothers and sisters in Almada are older and endured faithfully during the ban, setting an example to the younger ones.

00:59:52.130 --> 01:00:10.679
In addition to theocratic activities, our brothers and Almada regularly come together to associate, which can include a game of soccer or singing songs.

01:00:10.679 --> 01:00:16.679
They all send their love and greetings to the worldwide brotherhood.

01:00:16.679 --> 01:00:22.679
This is JW Broadcasting from the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses.
