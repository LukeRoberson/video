00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:09.419
During his first imprisonment in Rome from about 59 to 61 CE, the Apostle Paul was permitted

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:15.300
to stay in his own hired house, though he was constantly guarded by a soldier.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.539
During those two years he preached to everyone who came to him, and he wrote inspired letters

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:27.539
to the Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Philemon, and evidently Hebrews, too.

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.980
And then Paul was apparently released.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.179
Now he could renew his missionary activity, he could write to Timothy who was serving

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:38.979
an Ephesus and to Titus who was serving on Crete.

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:44.140
Soon though Roman Emperor Nero reportedly blamed Christians for the fire that destroyed

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.820
much of Rome, and once again Paul found himself in chains.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.859
After decades of faithful Christian service, the year was 65 CE.

00:00:57.859 --> 00:00:59.619
How did Paul feel?

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:05.900
We get our answer by reading from his second letter to Timothy which he wrote from prison.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.659
Turn please to 2 Timothy chapter 4.

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.060
Did the men who apprehended Paul carry swords?

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.459
No doubt.

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:21.659
Did seeing those swords remind Paul how King Herod a grip of the first had executed

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.260
James the brother of John by sword?

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.099
We can only imagine.

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:33.620
But from this excerpt from 2 Timothy, we see that Paul sensed that his own execution was

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.260
imminent, and we also see something else.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.540
Here we see the three things that strengthened Paul as he faced execution.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:51.299
Please read with me 2 Timothy chapter 4 verses 6 through 8.

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:58.659
For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time for my releasing

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.180
is imminent, that is to say his death which would allow for his eventual resurrection

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.859
to Christ's heavenly kingdom.

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:10.500
And verse 7 continues, I have fought the fine fight.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.780
I have run the race to the finish.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.780
The finish.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:23.819
Yes, Paul sensed that he was approaching a triumphant end to his personal race.

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.819
He continues, I have observed the faith.

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.020
From this time on, there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.740
And here we see Paul's strong hope.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.939
And he continues, which the Lord.

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:45.539
The righteous judge will give me as a reward in that day.

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:51.819
A can you see Paul's strong relationship with Jehovah in this expression.

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.539
His unflagging confidence that God's son would bestow the promised reward.

00:02:56.539 --> 00:03:06.500
And then he says, yet not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his manifestation.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.580
Paul loved his Christian brothers, and he didn't forget them.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.900
That's how Paul was able to rejoice, despite the threat of death.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.580
His brothers, his relationship with Jehovah and his hope.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.659
It's not that Paul wanted to die, of course he would have preferred to live on and keep

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:28.180
serving Jehovah together with his Christian brothers and sisters, yet he faced death

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.780
with courage.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.180
And he rejoiced in the reward that he knew was reserved for him.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.379
Now like Paul, we too can rejoice, despite the threat of death.

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:40.780
How so?

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.819
Let's go back to our theme text in Romans chapter 8 and verse 35.

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:52.340
What is the answer to the two questions Paul poses here, namely, who will separate us

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.340
from the love of the Christ, will tribulation or distress or persecution or hunger or

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.699
nakedness or danger or sword, the answer is found in verses 38 and 39.

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:10.580
Or I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor governments, nor things

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.979
now here, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creation,

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:16.660
will be able.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:26.579
Yes, death is not able to separate us from God's love that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

00:04:26.579 --> 00:04:32.899
A temporary pause in the grave cannot extinguish Jehovah's love for his servants.

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:36.180
Does Jehovah still love Abraham, Isaac and Jacob?

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.779
How about Sarah, Rebecca, Joe, Moses, Daniel?

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:43.459
What about all those who have died in prisons and concentration camps on account of their

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:44.660
strong faith?

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.699
Does Jehovah still love them?

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:49.139
Of course he does.

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:54.259
And he still loves the hundreds of brothers and sisters who have died in recent months

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:56.420
as a result of COVID-19.

00:04:56.459 --> 00:05:00.100
He still loves your grandma, your dad, your sister.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.860
He keeps them in his memory.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.699
He'll call them back to life.

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:11.300
And this fact helps us, dear friends, when we face the threat of death by sword as Paul

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.860
did.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.180
Now as you watch the following video, note which specific provisions from Jehovah helped

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:35.449
our brother, Bati Michael Dubbe, to rejoice despite facing the threat of death.

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:44.050
When everything falls apart and when everything around you is chaotic, the one thing you have

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.009
is your relationship with Jehovah.

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:50.449
My name is Bati Michael Dubbe.

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:54.810
I was born in Monrovia, Liberia, in 1980.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:00.850
Growing up in Monrovia before the war was an amazing time.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.730
I had wonderful parents.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:08.009
We grew up in a nice house and we went to a great school.

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:13.290
When I was nine years old, everything changed overnight.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:19.649
There was reports of rebels trying to take over the government.

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:25.529
Those reports alone made people panic.

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:27.930
This is started to close down.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.529
Services were shut down.

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:34.850
The lights, the power, the water, everything stopped.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.449
The next few years were really unstable.

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:43.250
In 1996, things again fell apart completely.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.889
It was all out war.

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:48.529
This time the rebels were in the city.

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:51.850
There was a lot of looting going on.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.649
There was a lot of shooting.

00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:59.970
The rebels they were known for torture, if people would not agree to fight with them.

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:10.240
In a situation like that, there's a lot of fear.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.800
There's a lot of panic.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:18.000
And when your fear levels rises, the best way to deal with it is prayer.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Prayer to Jehovah, asking him specifically for directions on what to do next.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.279
As the fighting escalated and it got closer to where we lived, it was no longer safe.

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:35.560
We had to flee and we ended up at the branch office.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.120
Brothers were very loving.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.199
They took really good care of us.

00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:47.259
Our spiritual activities, they made sure we kept up with that.

00:07:47.259 --> 00:07:51.899
Looking back, I'm very grateful to have survived.

00:07:51.899 --> 00:07:54.819
Two things help us get through.

00:07:54.819 --> 00:07:57.899
Number one, our relationship with Jehovah.

00:07:57.899 --> 00:08:00.899
That's the only thing that keeps you stable.

00:08:00.899 --> 00:08:07.019
And then also, we were able to survive because of the help from the brothers and sisters.

00:08:07.019 --> 00:08:14.620
Those moments of trial, that's when you really realize how much you need the brotherhood.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:20.100
I have a lot of joy in my assignment at Bethel with audio video services.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.939
I love the brothers and sisters that I work with.

00:08:23.939 --> 00:08:32.039
It's all thanks to Jehovah that I'm alive and I get to serve him every day.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:37.200
This video reminds us that life in this system of things is fragile.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:42.879
But did you notice what helped Brother Doug Bay to rejoice despite the threat of death?

00:08:42.879 --> 00:08:47.919
It was his relationship with Jehovah and it was his Christian brothers who helped him

00:08:47.919 --> 00:08:54.360
to keep his hope alive through regular study, meetings and preaching.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.919
Is it possible that some of us will have to die for our faith?

00:08:58.919 --> 00:09:04.039
As many early Christians did and as some modern day witnesses have done?

00:09:04.039 --> 00:09:10.639
Yes, we're not guaranteed a trouble-free existence in this system of things.

00:09:10.639 --> 00:09:16.039
And there's the very real possibility that we may die by illness, accident or the other

00:09:16.039 --> 00:09:19.039
ravages of these last days.

00:09:19.039 --> 00:09:25.200
We might die before the New World comes as many of our dear friends already have, or

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.840
we may be spared alive through the Great Tribulation.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:36.240
Either way, we need to be determined to remain faithful to Jehovah right down to the end.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:41.120
The one who has endured to the end will be saved.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:47.919
If we assume that the New World will arrive before we die, we may be unprepared to remain

00:09:47.919 --> 00:09:51.360
loyal to the death, if necessary.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:57.320
Similarly, if we assume that the Great Tribulation will not come in our lifetime, we will be unprepared

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.000
for its hardships.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:06.519
The only way to be prepared for either eventuality is to stay spiritually strong and alert.

00:10:06.519 --> 00:10:13.919
Keep on the watch, therefore, Jesus said, because you do not know on what day your Lord

00:10:13.919 --> 00:10:16.769
is coming.

00:10:16.769 --> 00:10:21.889
It's been good for us to consider more closely the Apostle Paul's strong conviction

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:26.289
as expressed in Romans 8, verse 35.

00:10:26.289 --> 00:10:29.370
What have we learned from this symposium?

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:36.730
We've seen how Romans 8, verses 35 through 39 assure us that no trial of any sort will

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:39.649
cause Jehovah to stop loving us.

00:10:39.649 --> 00:10:44.929
Knowing that we have Jehovah's approval and love, even while under trial, is a key to

00:10:44.929 --> 00:10:52.889
rejoicing, despite tribulation, distress, persecution, hunger, nakedness, danger, sword,

00:10:52.889 --> 00:10:54.690
or anything else.

00:10:54.690 --> 00:11:01.330
Therefore continue to draw closer to the one who loves you so very much.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:05.250
Strengthen your trust in Jehovah through personal study and prayer.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.570
Keep assuring your heart of his love.

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:13.289
Treasure our precious brotherhood and draw closer to one another.

00:11:13.289 --> 00:11:18.570
Bearish your God-given hope and meditate on the real life yet ahead.

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:25.049
And finally, remember the inspired prayer found at Colossians 1-11.

00:11:25.049 --> 00:11:30.529
If we continue doing these things dear friends, then like Paul, we will be able to rejoice

00:11:30.529 --> 00:11:33.929
despite trials of any sort.

00:11:33.929 --> 00:11:40.970
Notice these encouraging words found at Colossians 1-11.

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:49.889
And may you be strengthened with all power according to his glorious might.

00:11:49.889 --> 00:11:54.529
Now just how much power is there according to God's glorious might?

00:11:54.529 --> 00:11:59.090
We don't have to imagine because his word reveals what Jehovah has accomplished and will

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:04.370
yet accomplish by means of his Holy Spirit, the most powerful force there is, and for

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:07.450
what purpose will he grant you this?

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:10.570
Not simply so that you may endure.

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:13.970
Not merely so that you may endure fully.

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:20.929
Not only so that you may endure fully with patience, but as it says, so that you may

00:12:20.929 --> 00:12:26.049
endure fully with patience and joy.

00:12:26.049 --> 00:12:31.529
And with that assurance, we can endure despite any trial, no matter how difficult it is,

00:12:31.529 --> 00:12:38.169
no matter how long it lasts, because our Father's unfailing love will enable us to rejoice,

00:12:38.169 --> 00:12:41.570
with for all eternity and always.
