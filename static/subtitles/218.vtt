00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.009
Do you ever feel disadvantaged?

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:11.009
Do you feel that perhaps because of unfavorable circumstances over which you have no control,

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:15.009
you just don't have a fair chance in life?

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:20.010
Maybe you feel that in the race of life, others seem to be able to run freely,

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.010
but you have to run with a crutch.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:30.010
In this program, we're going to talk about a very endearing aspect of Jehovah's personality.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.009
His loving care for the disadvantaged.

00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:39.009
We'll delve into his feelings for such ones, his respect for them,

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:43.009
and his long history of caring for them.

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:49.009
We'll also consider how Jehovah's care of the lowly ones draws us closer to him

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:54.009
and how it can reassure you if you face disadvantages in your life.

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:59.009
To begin with, who are the disadvantaged?

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:03.009
When we speak of disadvantaged ones in this discussion,

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:07.010
we're not talking about the inadequacies of the person,

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:13.010
but rather of the unfortunate circumstances in life that one must contend with.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.010
Often a person inherits the situation through no fault of his own.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:26.010
Among such ones, the Bible specifically mentions widows, orphans, and foreign residents.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.010
Notice this at Deuteronomy 24-17.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:36.010
You must not pervert the judgment of the foreign resident or of the fatherless child,

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:42.010
and you must not seize the garment of a widow as security for a loan.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.010
The watchtower said,

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.010
the law specifically protected those who could not protect themselves,

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.010
such as orphans, widows, and foreign residents.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.010
Psalm 1014 refers to such ones as unfortunate victims.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.010
The Bible also uses the term lowly ones,

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:10.580
not because they're less important, but because of their circumstances.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.580
Our next main question is, how does Jehovah feel about such ones?

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.580
We really see a beautiful aspect of Jehovah's personality here,

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.580
his compassion and empathy in action.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.580
Since a widow doesn't have a husband to care for her,

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.580
and orphan doesn't have parents to provide for and protect him,

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.580
and a foreigner has no advocate, Jehovah steps in,

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.580
and fills those roles personally.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.580
Notice this in the wording of Psalm 68 in verse 5,

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.580
a father of the fatherless,

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.580
and a protector of widows is God in his holy dwelling.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.580
Jehovah himself assumes the responsibility left vacated.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.580
He becomes the father.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.580
He becomes the protector.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.580
As their protector, note how he views their care at Exodus 22,

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.580
22 through 24.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.580
You must not afflict any widow or fatherless child.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.580
If you afflict him at all so that he cries out to me,

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.580
I will unfailingly hear his outcry,

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.580
and my anger will blaze, and I will kill you with the sword,

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.580
and your wives will become widows, and your children will be fatherless.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.580
Regarding this verse, the watchtower said,

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.580
Notice that Jehovah did not leave it up to the human judges in Israel

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.580
to enforce this law.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.580
God himself would execute judgment upon anyone who took advantage

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.580
of a defenseless child.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:00.580
This is how personally Jehovah takes the care of the lowly disadvantaged ones.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.580
They become his responsibility.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.580
They come under his protection.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.580
Jehovah personally makes up for any disadvantage they may have.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.300
The fact that Jehovah takes personal responsibility for such ones

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:22.300
is further seen in Proverbs 19, 17.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.300
The one showing favor to the lowly is lending to Jehovah,

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.300
and he will repay him for what he does.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.300
Let's walk through the process that this verse describes.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:41.300
First, we assist the lowly, or we show favor to them in some way.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.300
We help them in a practical way.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.300
We encourage them.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.300
We make sure they get justice, or care for something else they're in need of.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:56.300
Well, as discussed, Jehovah has assumed the responsibility to care for these disadvantaged ones.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:03.300
So when we step in and assist, Jehovah views this as if we are giving to him,

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.300
assisting him with his responsibility.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:13.300
But Jehovah doesn't view it as a gift or payment, but as a loan.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.300
What's the difference between a gift and a loan?

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.300
A loan must be repaid.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.300
Imagine when we assist the disadvantaged,

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.300
Jehovah actually views himself as indebted to us lowly humans.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.300
Jehovah will repay that debt with favor and blessings.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:45.740
Without a doubt, Jehovah feels strongly about the care of disadvantaged ones.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.740
Let's consider this a little further.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.740
Because of Jehovah's love and compassion for the disadvantaged,

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.740
he enacted laws to protect them in Israel.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.740
In these laws, we see the depth of Jehovah's understanding

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.740
and his tender care and protection of such ones.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.740
Consider just two examples.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.740
First, let's look at his law regarding a security for a loan.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.740
We find this at Exodus 22, 26, and 27.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:23.410
If you seize the garment of your fellow man as security for a loan,

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.410
you are to return it to him by sunset.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.410
For it is his only covering, his clothing to cover his body,

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.410
in what will he lie down to sleep.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:39.410
When he cries out to me, I will certainly hear, for I am compassionate.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.410
There's compassion in this law for any poor Israelite

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:46.410
who might find himself in this situation.

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:51.410
However, note the additional stipulation made in the case of widows

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.410
as stated at Deuteronomy 24-17.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:00.389
You must not pervert the judgment of the foreign resident

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:02.389
or of the fatherless child,

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:09.389
and you must not seize the garment of a widow as security for a loan.

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:15.389
In the widow's case, no Israelite was to take her garment as security at all.

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:19.389
Jehovah evidently wanted to eliminate any chance

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:24.389
that she be left overnight without her garment to keep her war.

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:27.389
Isn't that beautiful?

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:32.389
Don't we see Jehovah's special love and care for disadvantaged ones

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:35.829
and a law like this?

00:07:35.829 --> 00:07:39.829
Here's a second example of a law made to help the lowly ones.

00:07:39.829 --> 00:07:43.829
In this case, it was related to the sacrifices the Israelites

00:07:43.829 --> 00:07:47.829
were to make to Jehovah for the forgiveness of their sins.

00:07:47.829 --> 00:07:53.829
We know the importance of blood in regard to sacrifices to atone ones from sin.

00:07:53.829 --> 00:08:00.829
Leviticus 1711 tells us that it is the blood that makes atonement.

00:08:00.829 --> 00:08:04.829
However, note the provision made for the very poor in Israel

00:08:04.829 --> 00:08:09.660
found at Leviticus 5-11.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:13.660
Now if he cannot afford two turtle doves or two young pigeons,

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:20.660
he must bring as his offering for his sin a tenth of an epha of fine flour

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.660
for sin offering.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.660
Regarding this, the watchtower said,

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:30.660
for the very poor, Jehovah chose to make an exception

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.659
and allow a sin offering without blood.

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:37.659
In Israel, poverty denied no one the blessing of atonement

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:40.659
or the privilege of making peace with God.

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:42.659
The watchtower continued,

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:46.659
does that mean that the flour offerings of the poor were worthless?

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:47.659
No.

00:08:47.659 --> 00:08:53.659
Jehovah surely valued the humble willing spirit behind such offerings.

00:08:53.659 --> 00:08:57.659
Furthermore, the sins of the entire nation, including the poor,

00:08:57.659 --> 00:09:04.659
were covered by the blood of the animals offered to God on the annual day of atonement.

00:09:04.659 --> 00:09:09.659
In this, we see Jehovah's reasonableness, his compassion,

00:09:09.659 --> 00:09:12.659
and his love for the disadvantaged.

00:09:12.659 --> 00:09:14.659
No one was left out,

00:09:14.659 --> 00:09:22.700
and they received the same refreshment from their sacrifice as any other Israelite.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:27.700
So far in our discussion, we've highlighted that Jehovah takes personal responsibility

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.700
for the care of disadvantaged ones.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.700
He steps in and fills the vacated role.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:39.700
And when we assist such ones, he views it as lending to him.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:48.700
Further, we see his love and compassion in the laws he enacted to protect such ones in Israel.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.700
But here's an important question.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:58.700
When you think about the special place Jehovah has in his heart for disadvantaged ones,

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:02.700
how does that make you feel about him?

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.700
Doesn't it draw you closer to Jehovah?

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:10.980
We can't help but love him for it.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.980
Jehovah's love and care for the disadvantaged is in such stark contrast

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.980
to the way such ones are often treated in the world.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:22.980
Sadly, the world often steps on the disadvantaged,

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.980
taking more advantage of them because they can.

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:31.980
Further, who does the world praise and promote?

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.980
Isn't it typically the beautiful, the rich,

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:38.980
the talented, the funny, the charismatic?

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:46.980
Whereas the common person, even more so, the disadvantaged often doesn't receive such favor.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:54.490
By contrast, Jehovah is on the lookout for the lowly ones.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:56.490
This brings us to our next question.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:03.490
How is this reassuring for those of us who are disadvantaged in one way or another?

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:08.490
At the outset, we ask that question, do you feel disadvantaged?

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:11.490
What are your circumstances?

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:15.490
Maybe because of your situation, you relate to the widow,

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:19.490
the orphan, or the foreign resident in Israel.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:23.490
And while the mosaic law specifically mentioned those three,

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:26.490
we could broaden those groups today, couldn't we?

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:30.490
For example, we certainly have widows in our midst today

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:34.490
and our hearts truly go out to these dear ones.

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:40.490
But couldn't we also include in this group wives who are neglected or abused by their husbands,

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:44.490
verbally, emotionally, or physically?

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:49.490
Such ones don't have the normal protection expected of a husband.

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:54.490
Couldn't we also include single parents, either because of the death of a mate

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:58.490
or because of divorce or abandonment?

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:03.490
Along with orphans, couldn't we include children of single parents,

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:07.490
children of parents addicted to alcohol or drugs,

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:13.490
or children of parents suffering from severe depression or other debilitating mental illness?

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:19.490
In these cases, the children may not be getting the normal care and training that's due to them.

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:22.490
And what about foreigners?

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:27.490
These are disadvantaged because they have no advocate, no legal recourse for protection.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:34.490
Couldn't we also include in this group ones who are minorities in the land where they live

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:38.490
and so are often discriminated against?

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:44.490
Really, we could include any who do not have the normal protection do them

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:48.490
or just don't have the same opportunities as others,

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:53.490
any who feel disadvantaged, such as the impoverished, the disabled,

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.490
those with a lack of education or training.

00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:03.490
Those who because of unfavorable circumstances in their youth didn't get a fair chance

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:06.490
and the list could go on.

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:10.490
What makes you feel disadvantaged?

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:18.490
Well, all of Jehovah's loving tender care for the lowly ones who we discussed earlier applies to you.

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:25.490
Jehovah feels just as strongly about your situation as he did for the widow and orphan and foreign resident

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:27.490
in Israel.

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:33.490
He takes personal responsibility for your care and protection.

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:39.490
Note what the Bible says about him at Isaiah 57-15.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:46.490
For this is what the high and lofty one says, who lives forever and whose name is holy.

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:54.490
I reside in the high and holy place, but also with those crushed and lowly in spirit

00:13:54.490 --> 00:14:01.490
to revive the spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of those being crushed.

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:05.490
Here, Jehovah says that he resides with the lowly ones.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:09.490
That means that he doesn't just see your situation from afar.

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:12.490
He doesn't just come and go quickly.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:18.490
Note this gives the sense that he sits down, he gets comfortable and stays with you.

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:22.490
And for what purpose does he remain close to you?

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:32.799
To revive your spirit and your heart, he has open concern for your welfare.

00:14:32.799 --> 00:14:37.799
Have you personally experienced Jehovah's loving help in your situation?

00:14:37.799 --> 00:14:46.799
Of course, living during the time that we do, we know that we can't expect Jehovah to shield us from every hardship that comes our way.

00:14:46.799 --> 00:14:50.799
But have you seen him help you endure?

00:14:50.799 --> 00:14:53.799
Have you experienced him provide for you?

00:14:53.799 --> 00:14:58.799
Have you seen him answer a prayer at just the right time?

00:14:58.799 --> 00:15:07.799
Have you come across a scripture or article from the publications that gave you just what you needed when you needed it?

00:15:07.799 --> 00:15:16.799
Have you seen Jehovah's care through a thoughtful word or timely practical help from one of your brothers or sisters in the congregation?

00:15:17.799 --> 00:15:21.799
That is Jehovah residing with you.

00:15:21.799 --> 00:15:23.799
You are not alone.

00:15:23.799 --> 00:15:26.799
Jehovah is reviving your heart.

00:15:26.799 --> 00:15:30.799
He has assumed responsibility for your care.

00:15:30.799 --> 00:15:33.799
He takes it personally.

00:15:33.799 --> 00:15:37.799
You are important to him.

00:15:37.799 --> 00:15:43.200
And we just love him for it, don't we?

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:48.200
Well, there's something else that Jehovah does to help the disadvantaged.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.200
He gives you hope.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:55.200
You will not be downtrodden forever.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:03.200
Jehovah's care for the disadvantaged will be fully expressed in a new world when all this advantages will be removed.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:08.200
Psalm 145 verse 16 says,

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:13.200
You open your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:21.200
Not just the prominent, not just the favored, but Jehovah will satisfy the desire of every living thing.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.200
That includes you.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.200
The watchtower said,

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:38.200
The fulfillment of Jehovah's promises will be so impressive that the difficulties and trials of the present time will pale into insignificance.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:44.200
In the coming paradise, the blessings from Jehovah will surpass our imagination.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:50.200
And we will certainly experience unprecedented happiness.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.200
Nothing will be missing in paradise.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.200
Nothing will be unfair.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:01.200
Every person will have every advantage.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:08.960
Praise be Jehovah God, the protector of the disadvantaged ones.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.960
We hope that this discussion has reassured you.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.960
Reminded you of Jehovah's tender care.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.960
And given you confidence that Jehovah will always be there for you.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:24.960
He will always protect you whatever your disadvantage may be.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:32.960
And in the end, Jehovah has reserved a beautiful future for all those seeking refuge in Him.
