00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:09.759
Jehovah warned that in the last days, there would be critical times hard to deal with.

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:18.760
And there would be food shortages, pestilences, earthquakes in one place after another, and other fearful sites.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:27.760
We also contend with wildfires, volcanic eruptions, destructive storms, and man-made disasters,

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.759
as well as an increase of wallessness, civil unrest, and war.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:40.759
No matter where we live, we will likely be affected by some form of disaster, whether natural or man-made.

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:43.759
How can we be prepared?

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:47.759
First, we can prepare spiritually.

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:54.759
Isaiah 30-15 says, your strength will be in keeping calm and showing trust.

00:00:54.759 --> 00:01:01.759
So we need to build and maintain a close relationship with Jehovah and learn to trust in him now.

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:08.760
We do not expect divine intervention, but when we pray during times of distress,

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:20.390
his powerful, holy spirit can bring Bible passages back to mind to keep us calm and give us wisdom to make good decisions.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.390
Second, we can prepare physically by maintaining a go-back.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:37.390
Our go-back could include items such as first aid supplies, bottled water, non-perishable food, a Bible, and other necessary items.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:49.390
If possible, each household should also have a reasonable reserve of basic supplies at home in case it is necessary to shelter in place for an extended period of time.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.390
Check what government authorities recommend for your community.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.390
Also, we shouldn't forget to update the elders with our latest contact information.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.390
If we don't do so, valuable time could be lost into disaster.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:14.389
Additionally, during family worship, our family could review the types of disasters that could happen.

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:21.389
Remember, emergencies like terrorist attacks and unrest can occur anywhere and without warning.

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:28.389
So consider what could be done in each situation, such as where to meet and how to contact the elders.

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:37.139
And third, we can prepare to help others when they're experiencing a disaster.

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:41.139
So what can we expect if a disaster occurs locally?

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:51.139
If advance warning of a disaster is given, field service group overseers will make sure that everyone in their group is in a safe location.

00:02:51.139 --> 00:03:01.900
Immediately after a disaster occurs, each field service group overseer will contact everyone in his group to learn of their needs.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.900
It could take time to organize relief assistance, especially if supplies are limited.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:19.889
So it's vital that each of us takes steps to prepare, follows government warnings, and keeps the elders informed of our circumstances.

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:24.889
Philippians, two four states, look out for the interests of others.

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:30.889
When we are prepared, more attention can be given to those with the most critical needs.

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:37.889
And we may be able to help others in our own congregation and nearby, even if we're affected.

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:43.889
For example, in some circumstances, brothers may need a place to stay temporarily.

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:49.889
Perhaps we could open our home and help them, or they might need food or basic supplies.

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.889
We could share what we have.

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:59.889
In other situations, our brothers may need help cleaning or repairing their home when it's safe to do so.

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:06.060
But what if a disaster occurs in another area?

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:17.879
Should we travel there to help? If help is needed, the branch office will assign brothers to coordinate and assist with relief efforts.

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:23.879
So the best time to make yourself available is now before a disaster occurs.

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:26.879
Ask your local elders for an application.

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:31.879
Then when there's a need, the branch office will know you're willing to assist.

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:35.879
And do not forget the power of prayer.

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:41.879
By offering prayers in their behalf, by volunteering to assist with disaster relief efforts,

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:50.509
and by contributing donations to the worldwide work, we can assist our brothers.

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:55.509
No, we can't avoid all disasters, whether natural or man-made.

00:04:55.509 --> 00:05:03.509
But when we follow the direction from Jehovah's word in organization, our obedience glorifies Jehovah.

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:11.509
If we prepare spiritually, physically, and prepare to help others,

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:18.509
we can take comfort in knowing that Jehovah will bless our efforts to be prepared for a disaster.
