WEBVTT

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.160
to introduce the

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:17.839
Information I thought I'd show you this here and this is a blueprint now this one happens to be and I got it from

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.780
Friend of mine. This was part of the blueprint for building world headquarters

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:32.780
So this is a connected with the offices services building and that's the blueprint now what I did learn

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:35.060
is that

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.380
You also have and I don't in that business a lot of them are

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.579
White background now in webster's dictionary did capture that fact very nicely

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.020
Here's what it says

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:54.979
defining a blueprint that word a

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.859
photographic print in white on a bright blue ground or

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.060
blue on a white ground

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.579
It used especially for copying maps

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.420
Mechanical drawings and architect plans

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.299
particularly thinking of the

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:17.700
architect plans and I couldn't know but think about

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:24.579
Proverbs chapter 8 and we see there Jesus being referred to as the master

00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:31.900
worker and Jehovah really the architect he's the creator now Jesus was a spiritual

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:36.099
Success with that because he followed the architect's

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:47.420
Direction so that's something want you to keep in mind and we'll get to the blueprint as I'm calling it in a moment

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.819
The other definition and webster's dictionary I thought was pertinent

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:00.260
Something resembling a blueprint as in serving as a model or providing guidance

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.980
And I'd love that one little expression that appeared after that

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:09.099
especially a

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.099
Detailed plan or program

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.099
of action

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.819
So that's how I'm borrowing that word a blueprint with the

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:24.099
These following thoughts in Peter's second letter so if you could we're gonna show you

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.259
What I'm referring anyway to is a blueprint for spiritual success

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:31.979
So second Peter

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:34.259
chapter one

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:38.099
There's nine things you'll notice here that we're going to emphasize

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.180
In verses five through seven

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.939
So Peter writes for this very reason put forth all earnest effort

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.580
To supply to your faith virtue

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:54.979
To your virtue knowledge

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:57.699
To your knowledge self-control

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:00.699
To your self-control endurance

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:03.699
To your endurance godly devotion

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.900
To either godly devotion

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:09.699
brotherly affection

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.900
To your brotherly affection

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:13.500
love

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.500
So there's the blueprint

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.500
So there's nine

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.500
Thoughts that are expressed here

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.340
Obviously, there's a lot of other things that you have gave us the whole Bible

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:31.020
But this is just for a nice memory aid a good blueprint for you to continue as spiritual

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:37.740
Successful people now the first one there is earnest effort

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:43.740
That's basic now obviously and we commend you for it. You've shown earnest effort

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:52.699
Just to come this far to be invited to Gilead and to qualify for that and during your class

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:59.979
And going out in the ministry and the weekends earnest effort. So you have to continue that

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:02.699
You're not born with earnest effort

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:06.300
That's a decision you make. I have to make the same decision

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.699
We're going to put forth earnest effort starts there

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.500
no effort no success

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:21.660
So each individual has to decide I'm putting forth the earnest effort here and I'm going to be a success

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.899
And then you get the earnest effort and then this is what's involved here

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.620
I have the effort to have faith

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.300
now

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:46.139
Time doesn't allow to go to detail on each one of these but faith obviously is essential now notice and go to Hebrews chapter 12 or excuse me 11

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:49.579
Hebrews 11 and

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:57.579
The absolute necessity of faith to be a spiritual success here in chapter 11 verse 1

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:05.740
Faith is the assured expectation of what is hope for the evident demonstration of realities that are not seen

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:08.779
So it goes down to emphasize that the

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.459
Need for it now essential it is in verse 6 same chapter

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:18.699
More over without faith it is impossible

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:20.860
To please God well

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:25.180
For whoever approaches God must believe that he is

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.500
And that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:32.379
That's pretty clear

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:35.019
Not easy to

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:41.019
Misunderstand what's being said here you have to keep your assured expectation of what

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.980
You've been hoping for

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.980
That's part of being a spiritual success

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:50.540
It can't weaken and how clear does it get

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:54.139
You can't please God and I can't please God without faith

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:57.819
That's serious business and none of us want to

00:05:58.459 --> 00:06:03.339
go the remainder of the time not pleasing our heavenly Father Jehovah God and

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:09.980
Appreciate that in fact right before he went into that in the previous what we call chapter 10

00:06:11.019 --> 00:06:14.139
Notice verse 38 and verse 39

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:16.779
Of

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:22.379
Chapter 10, but my righteous one will live by reason of faith and if he shrinks back

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.660
I have no pleasure in him

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.620
Now we are not the sword who shrank back to destruction

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.420
But the sword who have faith for the preserving of our lives or

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.579
We're applying it now. You're going to be a spiritual success in him

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:43.019
Everlasting life, but to have to have faith

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.139
Crucial

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.420
now

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.579
Next he mentions virtue

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.579
now that has to do with moral

00:06:54.459 --> 00:06:55.899
excellence

00:06:55.899 --> 00:07:01.100
So all of you have that somewhere single others if you're married you have

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:08.300
virtue that moral excellence and when you're morally excellent especially in these

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.379
Last days in this world, Bordia stand out

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:22.459
And what does that do? It's not that you're trying to stand out your moral excellence your virtuous behavior glorifies God

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.779
And Jehovah appreciates that he wants us

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:33.980
To succeed at glorifying him bring attention to it is we don't joke about

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.180
immorality

00:07:40.019 --> 00:07:42.019
You know the mean the comedians are full of it

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:48.180
We're morally excellent. We don't have a thing to do with the spirit of the world

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.980
with that

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.180
now

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.180
Next he mentions here

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.220
knowledge

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.300
knowledge well

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.620
Obviously

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:05.060
You appreciate knowledge now you you had a lot of knowledge for you got to

00:08:05.699 --> 00:08:11.379
The gillie, but how many people and included in this organization have a few months

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.420
Of studying like you have

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:22.740
It is incredible, isn't I mean very hard for you to explain to others then you were reading the Bible before you got here

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.860
Don't raise your hand if you

00:08:26.819 --> 00:08:28.819
Didn't quite get there God forgives you

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:36.100
Pins on circumstances, but once you were here and we love our

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:44.179
Instructors here with the theocratic schools of teaching committee that you you have a whole lot more knowledge than

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:50.419
You did a few months ago. Don't you agree? It's it's it's just wonderful now

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:55.139
Part of you succeeding is don't be satisfied with this

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:00.019
Downpour of all his knowledge. Mm-hmm. Just take it as

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:04.340
valuable to keep going and get some new ideas on

00:09:05.059 --> 00:09:07.220
How to research some things and go with it

00:09:07.779 --> 00:09:10.500
But if you're going to be a spiritual success, you've got to keep

00:09:11.139 --> 00:09:12.820
Taking in the knowledge

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.059
That's very clear very simple

00:09:16.179 --> 00:09:19.139
And Jehovah will bless your intake

00:09:20.419 --> 00:09:22.659
Of knowledge. There's no end to it

00:09:23.539 --> 00:09:26.820
It's wonderful, you know, it's it's always amazed

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.860
Yeah, if I said the more I learn

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.740
The more I realize how little I know

00:09:36.019 --> 00:09:38.019
Now that's not just a

00:09:38.019 --> 00:09:42.899
Statement that's a fact and imagine what Jehovah. It's it's just but in that great

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.500
It'll go on preternity

00:09:47.539 --> 00:09:49.539
Taking the knowledge

00:09:49.539 --> 00:09:52.659
If you do it now you'll be able to do it forever

00:09:53.539 --> 00:09:55.539
What a honor

00:09:55.539 --> 00:09:57.539
Heavenly Father and then

00:09:58.659 --> 00:10:00.659
He mentions here

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:08.580
To your knowledge self-control now that's an aspect of the footage of the spirit that you're well aware of

00:10:10.179 --> 00:10:15.299
I have to have it you have to have if you're going to succeed spiritually and gain everlasting life

00:10:16.019 --> 00:10:17.539
You need

00:10:17.539 --> 00:10:20.980
self-control and you have to pray about it

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:25.539
Especially in these last days in fact notice first Corinthians

00:10:26.419 --> 00:10:28.419
chapter 10 and we'll come back here to

00:10:29.299 --> 00:10:31.299
Peter right after

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.700
so

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.539
Here in verse 12

00:10:38.139 --> 00:10:40.220
First Corinthians 10 12

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.220
So let the one who thinks

00:10:43.019 --> 00:10:46.139
He is standing beware that he does not

00:10:47.419 --> 00:10:48.700
fall

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.220
so

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.980
Our thinking

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:55.820
We need to pray for self-control with it because the devil and his wicked

00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:01.100
System as well as he and his demons are always trying to affect our thinking

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.899
So in this case here you think you're standing guess what

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:08.940
You're ball ready to fall

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:18.779
It's all by say Jehovah, please give me self-control or you see when the devil might try some sort of temptation or whatever some thing you face

00:11:20.139 --> 00:11:22.139
Give me self-control

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.700
I want to stand firm for you

00:11:25.419 --> 00:11:26.940
Now you're okay

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:29.899
The Holy Spirit will do that you'll have that

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:37.179
self-control necessary to oppose the devil and his wicked effort to

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.539
Make it so that we don't succeed. So it's just crucial

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.580
Now next he mentions

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:50.379
With self-control the blueprint goes on endurance

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.340
Ah

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:58.700
Why we could spend considerable time just talking about endurance

00:11:59.899 --> 00:12:01.899
It's absolutely

00:12:01.899 --> 00:12:07.419
Essential some of the things you've endured already and you dedicated life and

00:12:08.299 --> 00:12:10.779
As I told the brothers in the

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:17.580
Coordinators committee office, you know when we're facing these disasters and all these things and I've been telling them

00:12:18.059 --> 00:12:20.059
for some time now cheer up

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.220
It's going to get worse

00:12:23.019 --> 00:12:25.820
And so we keep a sense of humor with it, but uh

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.700
That's a fact

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:35.899
What what we're experiencing right now in this global pandemic? I was telling the branch class yesterday

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:39.179
I didn't bother me we've been waiting for this

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:44.379
We knew things like this were going to happen Christ Jesus is prepared us

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:49.100
Where's the shock now you got to think and Jehovah

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.299
Direct us with how to deal with these things, but

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:59.500
We endure and that's why Jesus you remember there's a Matthew 24 and we'll come back here

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.940
Matthew chapter 24

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.940
And

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.259
We've been so well equipped. It's all here

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.019
So we can be a success

00:13:13.019 --> 00:13:15.019
Verse 13 Matthew 24

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:22.139
But the one who has endured to the end not who showed some endurance

00:13:24.299 --> 00:13:25.820
No

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.820
The one who has endured to the end

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.539
Will be saved

00:13:30.539 --> 00:13:36.220
So that's what we beg Jehovah help us that's part of the blueprint. We're going to endure

00:13:37.259 --> 00:13:39.259
to the end

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:40.620
That's it

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.980
Whatever we have to face with Jehovah's support

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.860
We're going to succeed

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.340
now after

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.379
endurance he mentions

00:13:52.379 --> 00:13:54.379
godly devotion

00:13:54.379 --> 00:14:00.539
Now watch towers come in and on this uh years past and it's a beautiful

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:09.980
Thing to keep in mind and why this is so crucial to a spiritual success is and it's captured nicely here in the

00:14:10.779 --> 00:14:13.419
Revised translation godly devotion

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.740
So

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:20.779
The thinking there and to try to convey what was coming across here for all of us is

00:14:22.139 --> 00:14:25.820
You're devoted or undevoted to Jehovah personally

00:14:27.659 --> 00:14:31.340
That's this attachment to him personally

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.539
So some of you are married couples

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:39.820
Well you're made you want your mate to be attached

00:14:40.539 --> 00:14:43.580
To your god that you worship together

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.460
That's what is going to make a success

00:14:47.259 --> 00:14:48.940
godly devotion

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.779
Personally attached to Jehovah it affects every

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.659
aspect of our life

00:14:55.659 --> 00:14:59.500
We're attached to him it's personal it's it's just

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:04.460
Something special and everyone should have that feeling not just

00:15:06.139 --> 00:15:07.580
devotion

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:09.980
No attachment to him

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.659
We love him we're whole soul you get exclusive devotion

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:19.500
Right now I'm just thinking about thinking of him and and how you can't see him, but I got goose bumps on

00:15:20.539 --> 00:15:21.980
My back

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:28.220
Thinking about the love for him the attachment to him and how nice when if you are married your mate

00:15:29.259 --> 00:15:30.700
Has that

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.940
Boy you're gonna succeed

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:34.700
devotion

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.700
To him personally

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.860
for all that he

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:42.539
Has shown and will show it's just very personal

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.980
now next

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.940
He attaches after godly devotion

00:15:50.059 --> 00:15:52.059
brotherly affection

00:15:53.179 --> 00:15:54.220
now

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:55.740
brotherly

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:56.940
affection

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.379
so

00:15:58.379 --> 00:16:00.379
When you think about that now and

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:07.419
Appreciate it for the new mayor's comments and I saw this yesterday with you for a couple of lectures and then

00:16:08.059 --> 00:16:10.059
yesterday saw some of you after your

00:16:10.539 --> 00:16:14.059
last class and or the new mayor mentioned how

00:16:15.259 --> 00:16:21.659
You enjoy each other's company. Well what he was describing was your brotherly affection for each other

00:16:22.059 --> 00:16:23.500
It's it's real

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.340
It's genuine you have that

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:29.019
brotherly affection that should be true and all the congregations

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:34.299
You've displayed it well to succeed you got to continue to do that

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:37.500
So here's something for you to think about though because

00:16:38.139 --> 00:16:43.659
Commendably you've done them well with that. Sure you're going to take it back with you. Does need for

00:16:44.539 --> 00:16:46.539
godly devotion

00:16:46.539 --> 00:16:48.539
I you're gonna do that

00:16:48.539 --> 00:16:49.899
counting on it

00:16:49.899 --> 00:16:54.539
However, here's a thought for you from first Thessalonians chapter four

00:16:57.049 --> 00:17:00.809
First Thessalonians

00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:04.329
chapter four just something to consider

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:09.769
You soon to be graduates and take it with you

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:12.890
To your assignments

00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:17.450
First Thessalonians chapter four verse nine and then here

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:20.490
The 10th verse is well

00:17:21.529 --> 00:17:23.049
However

00:17:23.049 --> 00:17:25.049
Concerning brotherly love

00:17:25.849 --> 00:17:27.849
You do not need us to write to you

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.210
For you yourselves are taught by god

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:34.250
To love one another

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:35.769
In fact

00:17:35.769 --> 00:17:37.210
You are doing so

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:42.410
Toward all the brothers and all of Macedonia. Now notice this. This is a thought provoking

00:17:43.289 --> 00:17:48.039
Pointing but we urge you brothers

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:53.160
To go on doing so in fuller measure

00:17:54.359 --> 00:17:56.359
oh

00:17:56.359 --> 00:17:58.359
So that applies to you too

00:17:59.319 --> 00:18:01.319
You've shown it during your class

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:05.720
But want you to think about it from time to time so you're a spiritual success

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:12.519
You've got to ask yourself individually particularly and maybe as a couple if you wish

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.720
Are you doing it in fuller measure

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.920
Oh

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.519
Lot to think about

00:18:20.599 --> 00:18:22.599
Seeing as things get more and more critical

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.000
Good point

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
We need this godly

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:31.880
Expression here of our brotherly affection. We love our brothers

00:18:32.279 --> 00:18:34.279
We forgive each other

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.880
But we have this and it's got to get fuller

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.759
And we know you're going to do that you'll think about it

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.960
Just examine yourself from time to time with this blueprint

00:18:46.759 --> 00:18:51.319
Are you showing brotherly affection in fuller measure and you might get back

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.880
You know we're all different

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.640
I don't know your

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:59.079
circumstances obviously god does and christ jesus does but

00:18:59.799 --> 00:19:02.440
Uh some might say boy

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.279
She's just filled with brotherly affection

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.240
Amazing

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.240
I don't remember that about her

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.880
before

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:16.279
Or he I'm known so the sisters don't want you

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
If you don't like I'm picking on you

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:23.079
Same applies to the brothers but love brotherly affection

00:19:24.119 --> 00:19:25.880
Fuller measure

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:30.519
Something to think about from time to time now back here in Peter's

00:19:32.759 --> 00:19:34.759
Second letter

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
This is the last

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.029
Thought that he puts into the blueprint

00:19:42.309 --> 00:19:47.910
To your godly devotion brotherly affection and then notice to your brotherly affection love

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:50.630
So that has reference to agape

00:19:51.269 --> 00:19:53.910
So brotherly affection is a unique

00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:55.349
Uh

00:19:55.349 --> 00:19:58.549
Expression on brothers that love for them, but this is a

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:01.430
Principled love as you know

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:06.869
So it's governed by principle and that's the kind of love we need to keep on preaching

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:10.789
Because uh people are going to get more and more

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:16.230
Distinct with their contempt for us. It's it's growing in most

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:20.710
Countries while the agape is going to move is to keep on going

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:25.670
No matter how they mistreat us and what they say or do

00:20:26.309 --> 00:20:28.309
We're going to show love

00:20:28.309 --> 00:20:30.309
Until Jehovah says that's it

00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:34.950
No more preaching and think about our time right now because of this

00:20:35.589 --> 00:20:39.029
Threat there in these national security problems in different countries

00:20:39.509 --> 00:20:43.190
Metropolitan preaching in many countries. It's not happening

00:20:44.549 --> 00:20:47.099
Hmm

00:20:47.099 --> 00:20:49.099
Door to doors and problems of

00:20:50.059 --> 00:20:52.059
Memorial campaign is

00:20:52.859 --> 00:20:54.859
Different things going on

00:20:54.859 --> 00:20:59.500
Jehovah's given a spirit to the governing body to try to

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:03.740
Do the right thing respect Caesar and obey him as a ruler

00:21:04.299 --> 00:21:07.339
Uh, he makes you think what what are the inactive

00:21:08.539 --> 00:21:11.019
Or others that have known about the two. What are they thinking?

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.259
Well

00:21:13.259 --> 00:21:15.099
We hope the best for him, but you better move

00:21:17.299 --> 00:21:19.299
This is the serious business

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:23.460
Our agape love is going to help us to try to reach out to him

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:28.019
Uh, now is the time for action because the day's coming

00:21:29.539 --> 00:21:31.380
That's it

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:34.259
So once that great tribulation breaks out

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.500
That's it

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.500
Can help

00:21:39.539 --> 00:21:40.740
So

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:42.740
Those are the nine

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:46.259
Parts of the blueprint for spiritual success

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.420
Now

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:52.980
Notice the thought here and this is what we want to conclude with verse eight

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:57.539
For if these things exist in you now notice

00:21:58.579 --> 00:22:00.099
and overflow

00:22:02.019 --> 00:22:04.579
They will prevent you from being either inactive

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:09.859
Or unfruitful regarding the accurate knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ

00:22:10.579 --> 00:22:11.859
So there it is

00:22:11.859 --> 00:22:14.420
So just exhorting you

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:16.420
precious ones soon to graduate

00:22:17.059 --> 00:22:19.059
Uh, don't let it just exist

00:22:19.779 --> 00:22:23.140
The blueprint let all of this overflow

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:28.420
And you are guaranteed to be a spiritual success
