00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:07.440
Our theme Scripture is 2 Corinthians chapter 1, verses 3 and 4.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.939
Praise be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:16.940
the Father of tender mercies, and the God of all comfort,

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.940
who comforts us in all our trials so that we may be able to comfort others

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:28.940
in any sort of trial with the comfort that we receive from God.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.939
From the time we were born, all of us have been in need of comfort.

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:40.939
You don't remember the first time you cried because you were hungry, uncomfortable or needing to be held,

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:44.939
but you probably do remember the last time you needed comfort,

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:49.939
and no doubt many of us are in need of comfort right now.

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:52.939
This is understandable.

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:57.939
Psalm 90 verse 10 poetically describes our life as imperfect humans by stating,

00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:03.939
the span of our life is 70 years or 80 if one is especially strong,

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:07.939
but they are filled with trouble and sorrow.

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.939
They quickly pass by and away we fly.

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.939
Many different situations can cause us trouble and sorrow, disappointment or pain.

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:25.939
Some of them are what we might call common because every imperfect human has to deal with them,

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:32.939
getting sick, growing old and grieving the death of a loved one.

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.939
Other reasons for distress could be called circumstantial, accidents, economic problems,

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.939
the breakup of a marriage, natural disasters,

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.939
becoming a victim of abuse or other crimes, civil unrest and war.

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.939
In addition, we may need comfort related to our worship,

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.939
living in a divided household, experiencing persecution or imprisonment,

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.939
facing ridicule in school or at the workplace,

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:13.939
or perhaps a family member or a close friend leaves Jehovah.

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:19.939
Repentant wrongdoers also need comfort when they return to the congregation.

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:25.939
Whether the cause of our distress is common, circumstantial or because of our worship,

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:29.939
all of us are in need of comfort.

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.939
And the problem is worldwide.

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:38.939
First Peter 5.9 tells us that the same kind of sufferings are being experienced

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:43.939
by the entire association of your brothers in the world.

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:49.939
However, we can find comfort from the one who is revealed in verses 6 and 7,

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:55.939
where it directs, humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God,

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:02.939
so that he may exalt you in due time, while you throw all your anxiety on him,

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.939
because he cares for you.

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:10.939
Jehovah has always been the ultimate source of true comfort.

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:17.939
Moses was convinced that Jehovah would support and comfort him no matter what situation he faced.

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:23.939
With confidence, he wrote what we find at Deuteronomy 3327.

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:31.939
God is a refuge from ancient times. His everlasting arms are beneath you.

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:38.939
When we're down and struggling to get up, Jehovah will put his arms beneath us,

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:43.939
gently lift us up, and help us to get back on our feet.

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:50.939
The Psalms repeatedly express appreciation for Jehovah's tender care and comfort.

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:57.939
For example, the writer of Psalm 9419 voiced his gratitude to Jehovah by saying,

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:06.939
When anxieties overwhelmed me, you comforted and soothed me, as Romans 154 confirms.

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:11.939
All the things that were written beforehand were written for our instruction,

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:18.939
so that through our endurance and through the comfort from the scriptures, we might have hope.

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:25.939
No matter what's causing us distress, we can find scriptures that bring us comfort.

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:30.939
The book scriptures for Christian living includes the heading comfort,

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:33.939
which discusses many causes of discouragement.

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:38.939
Not only does it direct us to scriptures that confirm Jehovah's loving care,

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:44.939
but it also gives examples of Bible characters who suffered these hardships

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:49.189
and how Jehovah helped them.

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:55.189
One of the best ways to receive comfort from Jehovah is to ask him for it.

00:04:55.189 --> 00:05:03.189
In the words of Psalm 145, King David praised Jehovah for the way he answers prayers.

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:07.189
Let's read verses 18 and 19.

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:12.189
David wrote, Jehovah is near to all those calling on him.

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:19.189
To all who call on him in truth, he satisfies the desire of those who fear him.

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:24.189
He hears their cry for help, and he rescues them.

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:29.189
Just as a loving parent patiently responds to his child's cheerful cries,

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:36.189
Jehovah turns his compassionate ear to our pleas for help.

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:43.189
As described in 1 Samuel 1 and 2, the Israelite woman Hannah was so distraught

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:49.189
and extremely bitter over not having any children that she couldn't eat.

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:57.189
When she approached Jehovah at the tabernacle, she began to pray and to weep uncontrollably.

00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:03.189
Jehovah listened to and acted on this humble woman's prayer.

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:09.189
After that, Hannah went on her way and ate, and her face was no longer downcast.

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:17.189
Similarly, Jehovah will comfort us when we pour out our concerns in heartfelt prayer.

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:21.759
In view of all that the Bible has to say about comfort,

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:27.759
we're not surprised when we read the words of 2 Corinthians 1, 3, and 4.

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:30.759
Please open to this theme text for our discussion.

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:37.759
As we read it again, reflect on how these words can help us to comfort others

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:43.759
while we ourselves cope with the stressful conditions of these critical times.

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:48.759
2 Corinthians 1, 3 and 4 reads,

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:53.759
Praise to be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:58.759
the Father of tender mercies, and the God of all comfort,

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:04.759
who comforts us in all our trials so that we may be able to comfort others

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:11.759
in any sort of trial with the comfort that we receive from God.

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:19.759
The expression tender mercies comes from a word that's used to convey sorrow at the suffering of another.

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:26.759
It describes Jehovah's tender feelings for his faithful servants who are in distress.

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:32.759
Paul goes on to say that Jehovah is the God of all comfort,

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:36.759
so all comfort originates with Jehovah.

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:41.759
Verse 4 identifies a special way that Jehovah gives comfort,

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:45.759
and that's through our brothers and sisters.

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:47.759
Let's read it again.

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:55.759
It says that Jehovah comforts us in all our trials so that we may be able to comfort others

00:07:55.759 --> 00:08:02.759
in any sort of trial with the comfort that we receive from Him.

00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:07.759
Did you notice the connection between our receiving comfort

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:11.759
and becoming equipped to comfort others?

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:16.759
Jehovah comforts us, and as humans created in God's image,

00:08:16.759 --> 00:08:22.759
we are moved by His Holy Spirit to share that comfort with others.

00:08:22.759 --> 00:08:26.759
Therefore, Christians are not divided into two groups,

00:08:26.759 --> 00:08:30.759
those who give comfort and those who receive it.

00:08:30.759 --> 00:08:35.759
No, we all are obligated to give comfort,

00:08:35.759 --> 00:08:39.759
even though we ourselves are in need of comfort.

00:08:39.759 --> 00:08:41.759
How can we do this?

00:08:41.759 --> 00:08:44.759
Consider the Apostle Paul.

00:08:44.759 --> 00:08:47.759
During his first imprisonment in Rome,

00:08:47.759 --> 00:08:53.759
Paul expressed appreciation for many brothers who became a source of great comfort to Him.

00:08:53.759 --> 00:08:58.759
In Colossians 4, he mentioned some of them by name.

00:08:58.759 --> 00:09:03.759
Aristarchus, Ticacus, and Mark.

00:09:03.759 --> 00:09:08.759
We'll hear more about these three men in a later part of the broadcast.

00:09:08.759 --> 00:09:13.759
Paul was grateful for the efforts his brothers made to visit him

00:09:13.759 --> 00:09:17.759
and to comfort him by their words and practical assistance.

00:09:17.759 --> 00:09:21.759
But for Paul, it wasn't all about receiving.

00:09:21.759 --> 00:09:26.759
He used his time while in prison to build up those who came to see him

00:09:26.759 --> 00:09:31.759
and to write letters of encouragement to the congregations.

00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:36.759
A sister in South Africa by the name of Claudine imitated Paul's example

00:09:36.759 --> 00:09:40.759
after she underwent major surgery.

00:09:40.759 --> 00:09:45.759
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, she couldn't receive visitors.

00:09:45.759 --> 00:09:49.759
But Claudine was determined not to feel sorry for herself

00:09:49.759 --> 00:09:54.759
and she asked God to give her the strength to comfort others.

00:09:54.759 --> 00:09:59.759
Claudine contacted a woman who had studied the Bible in the past.

00:09:59.759 --> 00:10:03.759
The woman resumed her study and attended meetings by video conference.

00:10:03.759 --> 00:10:08.759
Next, Claudine started a study with the woman's younger sister,

00:10:08.759 --> 00:10:12.759
who gave her the names of four other women who wanted to study.

00:10:12.759 --> 00:10:17.759
By her determination to comfort others while coping with her own illness,

00:10:17.759 --> 00:10:22.759
Claudine started studies with a total of 16 women.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:31.200
At times, those who are distressed and in need of comfort may be reluctant to accept help.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:36.200
For example, after Moses related God's promise to deliver his people

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:41.200
from Egyptian bondage, the Israelites at first did not listen to Moses

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.200
because of their discouragement.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.200
Later, they did pay attention.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:51.200
Naomi, whose name means my pleasantness, was living in a foreign land

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.200
because of a famine in Israel.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:59.200
She was widowed and was grieving the death of her two sons.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:04.200
When she was able to return to Israel, the woman of Bethlehem greeted her saying,

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.200
is this Naomi?

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:10.200
Feeling that Jehovah was responsible for her bitterness,

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.200
she replied with the sorrowful words,

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:22.200
to not call me Naomi, call me Mera for the Almighty has made life very bitter for me.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:29.200
However, Naomi soon drew closer to God's people and accepted loving help.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.200
Her bitterness was replaced with joy.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:38.200
If you're suffering, try to resist the natural inclination to withdraw

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.200
and to avoid contact with others.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.200
This will be a challenge.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:49.200
But experience has shown that making the effort to be with others opens the door

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:54.200
to receive in the comfort Jehovah provides through the compassionate words

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.200
and actions of our brothers and sisters.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:03.200
The comfort Jehovah provides when we endure tribulation can train us

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.200
to be more sensitive to the needs of others.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:10.200
And that's the first step to giving comfort.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:16.200
Being attentive and observant to identify those in need of comfort.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:20.200
In many cases, the need is obvious.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.200
Our brother met with an accident or has lost his job

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.200
or a close friend or a family member has died.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:32.200
For some, the need may not be so obvious.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.200
We may notice a change in behavior

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:40.200
or their facial expression may tell us that something is troubling them.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:47.200
We don't want to pry, but we can kindly approach them and gently draw them out.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:52.200
They may need time before they feel comfortable opening up about their feelings,

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.200
so we want to be patient.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:02.200
The second step to giving comfort is pray to determine what we can do.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:07.200
There may be little or nothing we can do to eliminate the cause of their distress.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:12.200
For example, a long-time missionary who lost his wife said,

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.200
I don't want to get over it.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.200
I just want to learn to cope.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:23.200
The important thing for us to do is to apply the words of Proverbs 3.27.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:28.200
Do not withhold good from those to whom you should give it

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.200
if it is within your power to help.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:36.200
We may feel awkward, not knowing what to say or do.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:43.200
If so, reflect on the meaning of the Greek word often rendered comfort in the Bible.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:47.200
It literally means a call into one side.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:51.200
In other words, take the third step.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.200
Make yourself available.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.200
Don't feel that you have to give a speech.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.200
Our brother or sister needs to know that someone cares

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.200
and our very presence can be comforting.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:08.200
It could be that he just wants someone to talk to.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.200
If so, be a good listener.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:19.200
If you read scriptures together, emphasize that the words reflect how Jehovah feels about his suffering.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.200
It's not so much what you say or do.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:29.200
What counts is that you acknowledge his suffering and show heartfelt compassion.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:37.200
For example, a sister serving at World Headquarters lost her mother and father during the pandemic.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.200
After spending a long day of hospice with her mother,

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:47.200
she returned home to discover a huge fruit basket delivered by her fellow workers at Bethel.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.200
She commented,

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.200
it wasn't the fruit itself which I had eaten many times before,

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.200
or the way it was so beautifully decorated.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:01.200
But it was the thoughtfulness and love behind the gesture

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:08.200
that made my heart swell at one of the most difficult times in my life.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:14.200
When a devastating earthquake in tsunami struck Eastern Japan in March 2011,

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:18.200
brothers in Japan and other countries responded immediately.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:25.200
Two and a half years later, my wife and I made a personal visit to several congregations in that area.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.200
Brothers in Nepal had sent messages of comfort to one congregation.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:36.200
Brothers in another congregation showed us a board with many similar notes written in languages of the Philippines.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:42.200
Brothers commented, we can't read the notes, but we know what they say.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:48.200
What great comfort those short messages brought to our Japanese brothers.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:54.200
While we were there, Super Typhoon Haiyan was ravaging the Philippine Islands.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.200
Referring to the typhoon the Japanese brothers said,

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:03.200
now it's our turn to comfort our brothers in the Philippines.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:08.200
As this world sinks ever deeper into these critical last days,

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.200
our need for comfort will only increase.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:20.200
How grateful we are that Jehovah is the father of tender mercies and the God of all comfort.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:27.200
He has generously given us the gift of prayer, abundant words of comfort in the Bible,

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.200
and a compassionate worldwide brotherhood.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:39.200
As we benefit from these loving provisions, may we be alert to recognize others who need comfort.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.200
Determine what practical help we can offer.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:50.200
And take steps to comfort others while we cope during these critical times.
