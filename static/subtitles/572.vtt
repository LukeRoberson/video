00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:16.769
Have you ever been confronted by a bad report, a false report about Jehovah's people?

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:24.410
It may be a newspaper article or a segment on the evening news, or perhaps some subject

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.530
is brought up in the ministry.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:36.890
It could be a broad range of subjects, our neutral stand, our stand on blood, our adherence

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:45.009
to Jehovah's elevated moral standards and appreciation for the sanctity of marriage,

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:54.130
or our insistence on keeping the congregation clean by disfellowshipping unrepentant wrongdoers.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.729
But whatever the subject, there are some commonalities.

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:12.689
Such reports are often characterized by distortions, inaccuracies, and sometimes outright falsehood.

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:23.250
And inevitably, they're presented with certainty and surety as though they were fact.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.730
But when you're confronted with such a report, how do you feel?

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:37.180
Disheartened, discouraged, angry?

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:44.299
Consider the experience of a pioneer sister who was conducting a Bible study, and in the

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:51.260
course of conducting the study, a woman walked into the house unannounced, she didn't

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.980
ring the doorbell, didn't knock.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:01.099
And as it turned out in a acquaintance of the student, she walked right in and erupted

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:09.300
the Bible study, and in her hand was a book, written by a man who at one time had associated

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.979
with Jehovah's people.

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:19.210
The woman said to the student, you need to read this book.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:26.330
While an interesting conversation ensued, and our sister found herself in the position

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:35.210
of being cast in the role of a deceiver, how did she handle that situation?

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.330
And how did the Bible student respond?

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:45.889
Well, before we answer that question, let's see how the words of today's text and surrounding

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:51.169
verses can help us to have the proper view.

00:02:51.169 --> 00:03:01.740
Look if you would please, 2 Corinthians chapter 6, and notice verse 4, Paul says, in every

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.819
way, we recommend ourselves as God's ministers.

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:15.419
Now what follows is a lengthy series of circumstances and situations that the Apostle Paul faced

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:22.699
in his ministry, and that faithful Christians have faced in their ministry ever since.

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:28.860
In verse 7, the words of today's text, we recommend ourselves as God's ministers,

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.740
by truthful speech.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:36.180
Well, we worship Jehovah, the God of truth.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.979
And we take delight in that.

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:46.659
And as our watchtower comment makes the point, we're truthful in things big and small.

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.780
We love the truth.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.900
We love telling the truth about Jehovah.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.139
So it's interesting to note Paul's words in verse 8.

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:07.020
He says through glory and dishonor, through bad report and good report.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.500
And then this intriguing statement.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:16.420
We are regarded as deceivers, and yet we are truthful.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.220
Now that's an interesting paradox, isn't it?

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:28.069
To be truthful and yet cast in the role of a deceiver.

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:34.750
When we are confronted with a negative report that does that to Jehovah's people, it's

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:41.750
good to remember that Jehovah was the first target of such an attack.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:50.639
Look in your Bible at Genesis chapter 3, beginning in verse 1.

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:56.560
Now the serpent was the most cautious of all the wild animals of the field that Jehovah

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.399
had made.

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:06.560
So it said to the woman, did God really say that you must not eat from every tree of the

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.800
garden?

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.879
Now we learned something about Satan's method.

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:18.879
He didn't begin with a statement, he began with a question, and not just a question,

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:24.800
a question that was designed to sow seeds of doubt.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.759
Did God really say that?

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:34.360
Now in verses 2 and 3, the woman responds toward the close of verse 3, she actually quotes

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.480
Jehovah's command.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:44.720
You must not eat from it, no, you must not touch it, otherwise you will die.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.279
So she understood the command, and she understood the penalty.

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:58.319
But notice in verse 4, the serpent said to the woman, you certainly will not die.

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:08.110
Now that was a lie, but it was presented with certainty and surety, as though it were

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.279
a fact.

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:17.000
And then in verse 5, God knows that in the very day you eat from it, your eyes will be

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.279
opened and you will be like God, knowing good and bad.

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:32.370
Satan, the father of the lie, cast Jehovah in the role of a deceiver.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.730
And Jesus experienced similar attacks during his earthly ministry.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:43.410
And the Apostle Paul was labeled by his opposers as a deceiver.

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:50.730
So when we're confronted with negative faults, reports, we're not surprised.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:55.689
The question is, how will we respond?

00:06:55.689 --> 00:07:00.649
Have you ever considered some questions that Eve could have asked herself that would

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:04.490
have helped her to make a good decision?

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.449
Here's one.

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:14.120
What do I know about the person who is the source of this negative report?

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.439
What is his motive?

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:19.399
Does he have my best interests at heart?

00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:24.319
Or does he have an agenda?

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:26.839
And another question.

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:34.920
Before I accept as truth, a negative report from someone I don't know, is there someone

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:42.600
I do know, someone I trust who I can talk with and get some good advice?

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:47.319
Well Eve certainly could have talked with her husband and together they could have talked

00:07:47.319 --> 00:07:48.920
with Jehovah.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:55.680
And if Eve had asked herself those questions, the world would likely be a much different

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.990
place today.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:05.589
But Eve chose to believe a lie.

00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:11.230
How about the pioneer sister and the Bible student that I mentioned earlier?

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.870
How did they handle the situation?

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:22.310
Well the pioneer sister told us that she reflected on the fact that she was a guest in the Bible

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:29.149
student's house and so she felt it would be rude for her to interrupt the conversation

00:08:29.149 --> 00:08:34.039
so she chose to say nothing.

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:36.879
What did the Bible student do?

00:08:36.879 --> 00:08:43.919
Interestingly she asked the woman, do you know the man who wrote that book?

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:44.919
No.

00:08:44.919 --> 00:08:47.519
Do you know his motive for writing?

00:08:47.519 --> 00:08:51.620
Why would he write such a book?

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:57.500
Well I know this lady who comes and studies the Bible with me and I know her motive is

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:03.500
good so I don't think I need to read your book.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.700
What a beautiful response.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:12.860
The Bible student got it and we got it too.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:19.860
We know and we're not surprised that we will be the target of negative reports.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:25.419
At times we may even be cast in the role of deceivers.

00:09:25.419 --> 00:09:31.779
And Jehovah has frankly told us that there are some who are willing to exchange the truth

00:09:31.779 --> 00:09:35.700
of God for the lie.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.659
But that will never be true of you or me.

00:09:39.659 --> 00:09:44.500
Instead we hold to Jehovah the God of truth.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:50.820
We continue to recommend ourselves as God's ministers by truthful speech.
