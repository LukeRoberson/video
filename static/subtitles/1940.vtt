00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.939
Disasters can shake us to our core.

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:11.939
They can take away everything we have.

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:15.939
In some cases, even our loved ones.

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:17.940
Face with such tragedy,

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.940
many think these disasters are acts of God,

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.940
perhaps even His punishment.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.940
Some may feel that since God,

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.940
the creator of the universe,

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.940
as the power to control the forces of nature,

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.939
when natural disasters occur,

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:38.049
they must be His doing.

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:41.049
We were on the fifth floor

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:43.049
of our apartment building

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:45.049
when a nurse quick hit.

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:47.049
Everything shook

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:49.049
and in just seconds,

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.049
the building collapsed.

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:56.049
The hurricane destroyed everything.

00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:00.049
I was terrified.

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:03.359
When I woke up,

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.359
I realized I was trapped.

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:08.359
I couldn't move.

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:10.359
I laid there for two days

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:12.359
before rescuers found me.

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:15.670
When I was in the hospital,

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.670
my injuries were so severe

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.670
that I had to lose one of my legs.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.670
I kept thinking,

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.670
we are good people.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.670
Why would God allow such bad things

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.670
to happen to us?

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.670
And I thought,

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.670
what could I have done

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.670
to make God so angry with me?

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.670
Our natural disasters

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.670
really acts of God.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.670
What does the Bible say?

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.180
At 1 John 4 verse 8,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.180
the Bible assures us

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.180
that God's foremost quality is love.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.180
In fact, it says,

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.180
God is love.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.180
He wants us to be happy

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.180
to enjoy all the beautiful things

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.180
he created and to benefit

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.180
from Earth's natural forces.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.180
There is nothing in the Bible

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.180
to suggest that God is presently

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.180
using the forces of nature

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.180
to punish anyone,

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.180
wicked or not.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.180
Still, natural disasters

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.180
continue to happen

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.180
and bring suffering

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.180
and death to many,

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.180
including good people.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.180
Since natural disasters

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.180
are not acts of God,

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.180
and He does care about us,

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.180
why do they happen?

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.180
I learned that God does not cause suffering.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.180
But time in unexpected events

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.180
may overtake any of us.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.900
But it's not because God is angry with us.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.900
One day,

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:50.900
a friend of mine

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.900
who also lost her legs in the earthquake

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.900
told me that Jehovah's Witnesses

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:55.900
showed her from the Bible

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.900
that the Earth will be a paradise.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:59.900
We will have our legs again

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.900
and we will be able to walk

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.900
and run and dance.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.900
That gave me confidence

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.900
that God loves us very much

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.900
and He is going to make

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.900
everything wonderful.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.900
When I read Isaiah chapter 35 verse 6,

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.900
where Jehovah got promises

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.900
that the lane will leap like the deer.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.900
I finally understood

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.900
that a God who would make that promise

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.900
would never hurt good people.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.900
I had been lied to about God.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.900
But now I know

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.900
that Jehovah's promises are real.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:39.900
The Bible clearly teaches

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.900
that God is not responsible

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.900
for natural disasters.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.900
In fact, He promises

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.900
to eliminate all causes of pain and suffering.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.900
Look,

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.900
the tent of God is with mankind

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.900
and He will reside with them

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.900
and they will be His people

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.900
and God Himself will be with them.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.900
And He will wipe out every tear

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.900
from their eyes

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.900
and death will be no more.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.900
Neither will morning,

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:06.900
nor outcry,

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.900
nor pain be anymore.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.900
The former things have passed away.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.900
The former things,

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.900
including natural disasters,

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.899
will have passed away.

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:20.899
But if God is love,

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:22.899
why does He allow suffering?

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:25.899
How does He feel about your suffering?

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:27.899
How long will human suffering

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:31.439
continue?

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:33.439
