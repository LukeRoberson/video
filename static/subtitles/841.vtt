WEBVTT

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.169
So, what is the takeaway point up to this time?

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:08.689
I'm sure we got the point.

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:12.029
It's hoped us to think about our loving Heavenly Father,

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:16.329
Jehovah, as the merciful judge of the entire earth

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.570
and His Son, Jesus Christ.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.170
Yes, we can trust them to make proper judgments.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.010
We know that Jehovah and Jesus can read hearts,

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.089
and they have a long record of living

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:33.329
by the perfect standards of justice

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.689
that Jehovah has set up.

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:38.850
So, what about the future judgments

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.969
during the Great Tribulation?

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:43.409
Is there something that we can adjust

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:45.530
with regard to our understanding?

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.170
Well, before we start to do that, let's be quite frank.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.770
Over the last few years, we've had a few changes

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.090
with regard to the events that occurred

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.929
during the Great Tribulation.

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.090
And if you've been in the truth for a while,

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.049
sometimes it's a bit hard to remember,

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:06.290
was that what we used to believe, or is this what we believe now?

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.530
So, to help us to make sure that we've got some idea

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.650
of some of the events that occur during the Great Tribulation,

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.909
let's look at this review.

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.030
What event starts the Great Tribulation?

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.950
The destruction of battle on the Great.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.750
That will be the time when the political powers

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.670
turn on the world empire of false religion,

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.430
showing their disgust for this symbolic prostitute.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.430
This will lead to the destruction

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.510
of all false religious organizations.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:46.510
What event ends the Great Tribulation?

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.870
The Battle of Armageddon.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.469
That will be the final part of the Great Tribulation.

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:56.469
Jesus, along with the resurrected 144,000

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.989
and myriads of angels, will battle

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.590
with all those who opposed Jehovah, his kingdom,

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.950
and his people here on earth.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.939
This will be the war of the great day of God, the Almighty.

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:13.139
Now that we have the start,

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:15.979
and the end of the Great Tribulation in mind,

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:18.699
let's ask a few more questions.

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:23.020
How long will that time period be from start to finish?

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.259
The answer is, we don't know.

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:29.139
We do know that many events are foretold

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.620
to happen during that time period,

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.620
but these events may all occur

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.860
in a reasonably short period of time.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.740
For this discussion though,

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.539
let's focus on the few events that will occur

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:44.139
toward the end of the Great Tribulation.

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:49.180
When does the attack of Gogov May Gog occur?

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.900
It doesn't occur at the beginning of the Great Tribulation,

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.139
but toward the end of that period of time.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.620
This attack on God's people by a coalition of nations

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.819
will lead right into the Battle of Armageddon.

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.960
So Gog's attack will occur just prior to Armageddon.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.560
When will the remaining ones of the anointed

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.520
be gathered and taken to heaven?

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.840
The Bible book of Ezekiel indicates

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.759
that when Gogov May Gog starts his attack,

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:24.159
some of the anointed will still be here on earth.

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:27.800
However, Revelation 1714 tells us

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.520
that when Jesus battles with the nations,

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.240
he will come with those who are called and chosen.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.870
That is, all of the resurrected 144,000.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.629
So the final gathering of his chosen ones must occur

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.909
after the start of the attack of Gogov May Gog

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.909
and before the Battle of Armageddon.

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.430
This means that the anointed will be gathered

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.669
and taken to heaven toward the end of the Great Tribulation,

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:01.110
not at the beginning.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.389
When will the final judgment of the sheep

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:05.590
and the goats take place?

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.990
Again, although we can't be dogmatic

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.789
as to the exact sequence of events,

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:13.789
it appears that the final judgment takes place

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:18.470
at the end of the Great Tribulation, not at the beginning.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.029
That will be the time when the son of man comes

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:24.850
in his glory and all his angels with him.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.449
Of course, there are a lot of other events

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.930
that are foretold to happen during this time period.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.730
But for now, let's just focus on these few events,

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.089
all of which will happen just before the outbreak of Armageddon.

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.129
What do we learn from them?

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:46.569
First, Jesus' judgment of the sheep and the goats

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:48.410
and the destruction of the wicked

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.769
will take place at the end of the Great Tribulation.

00:04:52.769 --> 00:04:55.689
Second, there will be some of the remaining ones

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:57.730
of the anointed on earth

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.129
until the start of the attack of Gog of May Gogh

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:04.769
right at the end of the Great Tribulation.

00:05:04.769 --> 00:05:07.930
Third, the judgment of the sheep and the goats

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.930
will include their dealings with Christ's brothers

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:19.329
even during the Great Tribulation.

00:05:19.329 --> 00:05:23.129
So that is a review of what we already believe.

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:25.810
So if you are writing down notes of this and you point,

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.839
be careful what you say to others.

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:32.279
But how do these basic facts,

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:34.120
when we look at the things that occurred

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.720
toward the end of the Great Tribulation,

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.959
how do they affect our understanding

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:44.160
of Jehovah's judgments by means of Jesus Christ?

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.040
Well, we know that the closer we get to the Great Tribulation,

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.279
the clearer our understanding is of what will occur.

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:55.319
Yes, our understanding is clarified according

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:58.800
to the proper time and also in a way that will help us

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.519
not only to endure the Great Tribulation,

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:05.800
but also to prosper during that period of time.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.879
So what we're going to do is consider

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:15.600
four very interesting questions.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.399
Yes, and I've got some time left.

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:24.199
The first question is, once the Great Tribulation starts,

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.800
so we saw there in the chart

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.800
with the destruction of battle on the Great.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.800
So once it starts, is there a door of opportunity

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:39.839
for non-believers to actually join us in serving Jehovah?

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.720
Is there a door of opportunity?

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.199
What have we said in the past?

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:50.800
We've said, no, there will not be an opportunity

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.560
for people to join us at that time.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.560
Now, why did we say that?

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.560
Well, basically, we viewed the account of the flood

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.439
as being a type and anti-type portrayal

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:06.480
and that we thought the fact that the door of the ark

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.680
was closed prior to the flood coming,

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.240
indicated that the door of opportunity would close

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.560
once the Great Tribulation started.

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:21.480
But, of course, it's true Jesus did compare

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:26.480
the time of Noah with the presence of him as a reigning king.

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:31.519
But notice Jesus didn't say anything that indicated

00:07:31.519 --> 00:07:33.759
this was a type, anti-type arrangement

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:36.959
and he certainly didn't mention anything

00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:40.519
with regard to a door of opportunity closing.

00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:44.560
So let's think about that question again.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.079
Once the Great Tribulation starts,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.040
is there a door of opportunity still available?

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.199
Well, to answer that, looking at this time chart,

00:07:54.199 --> 00:07:58.160
remember the judgment of the sheep and the goats,

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.360
the final judgment occurs when,

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:05.360
not at the beginning, but towards the end of the Great Tribulation.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.360
So let's think about some that we know.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:15.360
Perhaps, I'm believing relatives, disfellowshipped ones,

00:08:15.399 --> 00:08:17.279
others that have heard the message,

00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:19.279
perhaps studied with us,

00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:23.399
could some of them, once they see the destruction

00:08:23.399 --> 00:08:28.639
of Babylon the Great decide that what your hovers' witnesses

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:31.639
were saying is correct after all,

00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:35.519
could they take a stand for the truth?

00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:40.279
Well, if they changed their hearts and joined us,

00:08:40.279 --> 00:08:42.240
would we be disappointed?

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:45.600
Now we can't be dogmatic.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.840
But we don't want to be like Jonah.

00:08:51.039 --> 00:08:55.120
And so, oh, no, the door's closed, no, no, no.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.080
You see, we need to remember other cases

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.279
in the scriptures that help us to understand

00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:04.480
how Jehovah as a merciful judge

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.960
has dealt with people in the past.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.720
For example, think about the Israelites when they left Egypt.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.720
Please, if you'd turn with me to Exodus chapter 12,

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.200
Exodus chapter 12, and we're going to read

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.480
the first part of verse 38.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.720
So here is describing the Exodus.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.639
And Exodus 12, 38 says,

00:09:27.639 --> 00:09:32.639
and a vast mixed company also went with them.

00:09:33.159 --> 00:09:35.480
Now, do you notice there's a footnote there

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.000
and what does it say?

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.559
That is, a mixed company of non-Isolites,

00:09:41.559 --> 00:09:43.799
including Egyptians.

00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:47.320
So what happened?

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.360
Well, during the time when the 10 complaints came

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:54.440
upon the Egyptians, obviously some of these Egyptians

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:58.759
started to see the distinction between Jehovah

00:09:58.759 --> 00:10:01.399
and the false gods that they worshiped.

00:10:01.399 --> 00:10:03.960
So when decision time came,

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.679
and Israelites were leaving Egypt,

00:10:06.679 --> 00:10:10.440
some of these Egyptians joined the Israelites.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.639
And that isn't that interesting for us to know.

00:10:14.519 --> 00:10:18.399
But of course, we might be thinking, yes, well,

00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:21.519
I understand why we said what we did before,

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:25.000
but is it really the case that all these ones

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.200
that we've stated with or so on,

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.120
some of them may have a chance to join us

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.399
after Babylon the Great is destroyed?

00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:35.720
Is that fair?

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.039
Last minute repentance.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.720
But you see, are we imitating the merciful judge

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.840
of all the earth?

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.639
Really, we shouldn't be surprised

00:10:47.639 --> 00:10:50.080
if that were to happen, should we?

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.559
And think about it.

00:10:51.559 --> 00:10:53.120
As we looked in the time chart,

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.519
we saw that this is a time period prior

00:10:57.519 --> 00:10:59.440
to the final judgment.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.360
So anyone who takes their stand for Jehovah

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.360
early in the Great Tribulation will still face

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.159
the attack of Gog of May Gog,

00:11:07.159 --> 00:11:09.879
and that will be a very, very difficult time.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.519
But now what do we need to note with regard

00:11:13.519 --> 00:11:18.519
to this, well, just as in the first century in 66 CE,

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:24.240
decision time came, and many decided to go

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.799
and leave Jerusalem at that point.

00:11:26.799 --> 00:11:31.720
Now, they made their decision based on what they already knew

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.240
and had heard.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.919
So in a similar way, our preaching work today

00:11:36.919 --> 00:11:39.159
is of utmost importance.

00:11:39.159 --> 00:11:41.799
But let's notice what the Apostle Paul said

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.639
is recorded in the book of Romans.

00:11:44.639 --> 00:11:49.679
Romans chapter 10 and verses 13 and 14.

00:11:49.679 --> 00:11:52.519
And as we read this, think about the context

00:11:52.519 --> 00:11:56.440
of what we're talking about when battle on the Great

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.039
is destroyed.

00:11:58.039 --> 00:12:02.720
So the time prior to that, see, it says in verse 13,

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:07.639
for everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved.

00:12:07.639 --> 00:12:10.879
However, how will they call on him

00:12:10.879 --> 00:12:13.480
if they have not put faith in him?

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.799
How in turn will they put faith in him

00:12:16.799 --> 00:12:19.480
about whom they have not heard?

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:24.480
How in turn will they hear without someone to preach?

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.320
Do you see why our preaching work is so urgent

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.720
and important today?

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:36.720
Yes, many take the opportunity to make a decision right now.

00:12:37.399 --> 00:12:41.960
But could it be that once the Great Tribulation starts,

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.919
many who have heard the message

00:12:44.919 --> 00:12:47.440
that Jehovah's Witnesses have preached,

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.519
may be in a position then to make the right decision,

00:12:51.519 --> 00:12:53.080
the right choice.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.399
Well, again, we can't be dogmatic,

00:12:55.399 --> 00:12:59.440
but we certainly hope that that would be the case.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.759
Now, while we're talking about this,

00:13:00.759 --> 00:13:03.679
let's talk about the elephant in the room.

00:13:03.679 --> 00:13:05.080
What do we mean?

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.200
Well, you know, some of us in the past,

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.240
we're not going to mention names.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.440
But you know, some of us have said,

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.759
oh, you know, my unbelieving relative,

00:13:14.759 --> 00:13:18.159
or, you know, I hope he dies before the Great Tribulation.

00:13:18.159 --> 00:13:20.559
Uh-huh, we know what you'd be saying.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.000
You said, because if he dies before the Great Tribulation,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.519
he'll have a chance of a resurrection.

00:13:27.519 --> 00:13:29.240
But during, mm-mm.

00:13:31.039 --> 00:13:33.440
But let's think about that.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:37.080
You see, does someone's eternal salvation

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.279
depend on when they die?

00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:44.360
Or does it depend on really their heart condition?

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.679
You see, the merciful judge of the earth

00:13:47.679 --> 00:13:49.960
knows their heart condition.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:53.080
And really, what are we thinking if we ask that question?

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.120
You know, we imagine Jehovah saying to Jesus,

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.799
look at this person, you know,

00:13:57.799 --> 00:14:00.200
they really should die forever.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.080
But look at it, they died now

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.240
before the Great Tribulation.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.039
Oh, now we have to resurrect them.

00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:08.360
I mean, really?

00:14:10.159 --> 00:14:14.679
Jehovah is the righteous, merciful judge.

00:14:14.679 --> 00:14:16.399
He knows people's hearts.

00:14:16.399 --> 00:14:18.399
He can't fool him or trick him.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.039
So that was the first question.

00:14:21.039 --> 00:14:23.840
I'm sure you found interesting, yeah?

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.759
Once the Great Tribulation starts,

00:14:26.759 --> 00:14:29.120
does the door of opportunity pose?

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.600
The answer is, well, we'll have to wait and see,

00:14:31.639 --> 00:14:33.759
but according to the scriptures,

00:14:33.759 --> 00:14:38.519
it is a possibility that some can make a stand for the truth.

00:14:38.519 --> 00:14:41.759
Second question, when does the preaching

00:14:41.759 --> 00:14:44.559
of the good news of the kingdom finish?

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:47.200
Good question.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.120
First start, let's remember,

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.919
the good news is only good news to us

00:14:51.919 --> 00:14:53.600
and those who accept it.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.519
As Psalm two mentions over the rest of the world,

00:14:56.519 --> 00:14:58.759
it's never been good news, hasn't.

00:14:59.759 --> 00:15:03.279
So what does Matthew 2414 tell us?

00:15:03.279 --> 00:15:06.679
It tells us that the good news is going to be preached

00:15:06.679 --> 00:15:11.000
and then the end will come.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.559
Let's look at that timeline again.

00:15:13.559 --> 00:15:17.159
What is the end referred to there?

00:15:17.159 --> 00:15:20.639
Well, it's the final part of the Great Tribulation.

00:15:21.679 --> 00:15:24.720
So that means that during the Great Tribulation,

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.559
the good news of the kingdom will still be preached

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.320
and it's still good news to us,

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.639
but not to the rest of the world.

00:15:33.639 --> 00:15:37.159
That good news will become more hard hitting

00:15:37.159 --> 00:15:41.360
as time goes on, causing people to make a decision

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.879
one way or the other, whether they accept the kingdom or not.

00:15:46.919 --> 00:15:51.000
So isn't that yet another reason why we shouldn't be surprised

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.919
that some may make a stand for the truth

00:15:53.919 --> 00:15:55.919
even during the Great Tribulation?

00:15:56.919 --> 00:15:58.240
The third question.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.879
All those who die during the Great Tribulation,

00:16:03.879 --> 00:16:08.879
will they go into eternal death and never be resurrected?

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.600
Well, initially we can say the goats,

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.519
they're not going to be resurrected, are they?

00:16:15.519 --> 00:16:19.039
Because they're going to everlasting cutting off

00:16:19.039 --> 00:16:21.360
according to what Jesus said.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.679
And in 2nd Thessalonians chapter one,

00:16:23.679 --> 00:16:28.120
it speaks of the punishment of everlasting destruction

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.960
being meted out.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.320
But what time period are we talking about?

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.159
Well, let's look at our timeline again.

00:16:35.159 --> 00:16:38.120
You see, this is referring to the time

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:42.320
when Jesus comes with his holy ones.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:46.519
So looking at our timeline, what does it show us?

00:16:46.519 --> 00:16:51.519
That this is at the very end of the Great Tribulation.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:56.440
When people are judged as being goats,

00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:01.440
specifically they have been given this judgment.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.799
But there are some other questions that come up.

00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:07.359
You see, these ones who are judged as goats,

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:09.839
those who receive everlasting destruction,

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:12.680
obviously have had adequate opportunity,

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:17.559
have had a full opportunity to accept or reject the kingdom.

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:21.720
But what about those prior to that final judgment?

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.680
So the Great Tribulation starts,

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.759
we're not sure how long it goes,

00:17:26.759 --> 00:17:28.960
but each day that goes on,

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.680
this people who no doubt will die.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:34.920
Do you realize every day worldwide,

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.920
about 150,000 people die,

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:42.920
either of natural causes, of wars, sicknesses, and so on?

00:17:43.039 --> 00:17:45.720
So what about those ones?

00:17:45.759 --> 00:17:49.960
They're not actually killed by Jehovah as a punishment.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.359
So what do we need to remember?

00:17:52.359 --> 00:17:57.359
The merciful judge knows who should be resurrected

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.480
and who shouldn't be resurrected.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.680
So we can't be dogmatic about those ones

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.839
who may die at that time.

00:18:04.839 --> 00:18:08.400
We know that Jehovah and Jesus will do the right thing.

00:18:09.799 --> 00:18:13.319
Now, another final interesting question.

00:18:14.319 --> 00:18:19.319
Will all those living during the Great Tribulation

00:18:19.319 --> 00:18:25.319
have a full opportunity to decide either for the kingdom

00:18:25.319 --> 00:18:28.319
or against them?

00:18:28.319 --> 00:18:30.319
How would you answer?

00:18:30.319 --> 00:18:33.319
Don't say that aloud.

00:18:33.319 --> 00:18:38.319
The simple answer is, we don't know.

00:18:38.319 --> 00:18:41.319
And we don't need to know,

00:18:41.319 --> 00:18:43.279
because we're not the judges.

00:18:43.279 --> 00:18:46.940
It's above our pay grade.

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:49.059
But now, there may be a little voice in you saying,

00:18:49.059 --> 00:18:50.420
but why don't we know?

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:54.420
I mean, I've always believed during that time, that's it.

00:18:55.619 --> 00:18:58.380
But you see, each day,

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:02.220
we mention 150,000 people on average die,

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:07.220
350,000 new babies are born each day.

00:19:08.059 --> 00:19:11.740
So even if the Great Tribulation was only a few days long,

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:15.900
each day you've got more babies being born.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:20.500
And what about areas where the good news hasn't reached

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.140
to the greatest extent?

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:25.460
Maybe in lands where our work is restricted,

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:28.420
we might be wondering, well, will we get to preach

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:30.660
to every individual?

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:32.619
Matthew chapter 10 verse 28,

00:19:32.619 --> 00:19:35.059
if you look at it later, seems to indicate,

00:19:35.059 --> 00:19:36.740
maybe we won't.

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.819
So now, here's an interesting question.

00:19:39.819 --> 00:19:43.259
Is it reasonable for us to say that

00:19:43.259 --> 00:19:47.339
Jehovah and Jesus automatically label millions of people

00:19:47.339 --> 00:19:52.380
as goats, even though they have never had a full opportunity

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.299
to respond?

00:19:54.299 --> 00:19:56.420
Interesting question.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:59.140
If they haven't had a full opportunity

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:00.940
and they die at that time,

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:04.539
is it possible that they may receive a resurrection

00:20:04.539 --> 00:20:06.940
as unrighteous persons?

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:08.460
What's the answer?

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:11.099
We simply don't know.

00:20:11.099 --> 00:20:12.980
We can't be dogmatic.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:16.500
And we shouldn't be dogmatic because we don't know.

00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:23.019
But rather, let's take comfort in what we do know

00:20:23.019 --> 00:20:24.819
and what do we know?

00:20:24.819 --> 00:20:28.339
We know that Jehovah and Jesus are merciful

00:20:28.339 --> 00:20:31.259
that they will always do the right thing.

00:20:31.259 --> 00:20:34.099
In Ezekiel chapter 33 verse 11,

00:20:34.099 --> 00:20:35.539
what does it say, Jehovah?

00:20:35.539 --> 00:20:38.779
It takes no delight in the death of a wicked person.

00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:41.019
He wants them to change.

00:20:41.019 --> 00:20:45.420
And we know that Jehovah and Jesus will judge each individual

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:50.619
in a balanced, righteous, and merciful way.

00:20:50.619 --> 00:20:52.779
Well now, at this point, you think,

00:20:52.779 --> 00:20:56.220
wow, that's a lot to take in.

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:59.660
Maybe your hands are a little tired from taking notes.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:00.900
Don't worry.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:04.980
An upcoming watchtower is going to give us all the details

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.740
on this, so stay tuned.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:11.180
But in the meantime, what do we need to keep doing?

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.579
We need to keep preaching the message

00:21:13.579 --> 00:21:15.819
to as many people as possible.

00:21:15.819 --> 00:21:19.619
We have no idea what results may come from that.

00:21:19.619 --> 00:21:22.299
And as we keep on preaching, remember,

00:21:22.299 --> 00:21:26.339
leave the judging to Jehovah and Jesus.

00:21:26.339 --> 00:21:29.660
They will always do the right thing,

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:33.140
the merciful and just thing of that.

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:35.980
We can be absolutely confident.
