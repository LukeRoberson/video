00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:10.060
On December 7, 2017, the Cestaretsky District Court of St. Petersburg issued an unprecedented

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:16.219
decision to confiscate the large national office in St. Petersburg of a foreign organization

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.739
by invalidating a 17-year-old contract.

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:27.100
We're talking about 14 buildings with a total area of 33,000 square meters.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.259
They're situated on approximately 25 acres of a beautiful landscaped area in the village

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.100
of Solnichlaya in the Cororotny District of St. Petersburg.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.219
This facility was transferred to the Watchtower Bible and Track Society of Pennsylvania

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:42.179
back in 2000.

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:47.780
During a four-hour court hearing, overwhelming evidence was presented that proved the validity

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.460
of the transfer of the facility to the foreign owner.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.820
For example, in 2007, the transfer of the property to the Watchtower Bible and Track Society

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.060
of Pennsylvania was thoroughly examined by the prosecutor's office.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:10.219
No violations were exposed and no claims were made.

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:16.060
The Watchtower Society had to pay taxes, though the administrative center, as a religious

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.260
organization that was legally registered in Russia, was exempted from paying land and

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.859
real estate taxes.

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:31.739
Over the years, the Watchtower Society has paid considerable taxes to the Russian Federation.

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:34.500
About $3 million.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.739
It's obvious that if this had been a fraudulent deal just on paper, nobody would have

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:43.620
spent this much money.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.379
Significantly, the Watchtower Bible and Track Society of Pennsylvania was not allowed to

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:52.260
take part in the hearing in April 2017.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.299
At that time, the Supreme Court refused to admit the organization into the case, stating

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.140
that its interests were not affected by the dispute.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.700
To explain it in simple terms, let's imagine that I am the owner of an apartment in which

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.219
my relative leaves.

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:13.740
Law enforcement officers charge my relative with some violations, perhaps on contrived grounds.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.860
Then government representatives come to me and say, hand over the apartment.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.659
I ask, why?

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:21.659
The answer.

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.620
Because in our opinion, your relative has broken the law.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.539
I say, excuse me, I haven't broken the law.

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:29.819
I haven't been charged with anything.

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.620
Why are you taking away my property?

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.659
But regardless, they say, yes, we are taking it.

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:42.460
It is noteworthy that the Russian Federation did not fund the construction of this facility.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.860
Jova's witnesses legally purchased an abandoned children's camp situated on this plot of

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.740
land from a Russian company.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.020
The facility was built using funds from foreign religious organizations, and by the hands

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.539
of the parishioners themselves.

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:04.020
So it's logical that these buildings were eventually given to the Watchtower Society,

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.659
which initially requested their construction.

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:13.780
We witnessed our fellow believers from many countries taking part in this project with great

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.620
enthusiasm and a self-sacrificing spirit.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.219
They came with their trailers and lived in them.

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:23.780
I mean, people made sacrifices to build it.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.699
Today we're witnessing how everything that was built with all this love and sacrifice

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:31.819
is being taken away for nothing.

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.340
It's very sad and painful.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:41.979
I feel that a part of my heart is being torn away.

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:51.099
The air, the landscape, everything that is there, it's like a part of me.

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:57.780
Something like this has occurred only once in the history of Russia 100 years ago in 1918.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.379
At that time, the Council of People's Commissars issued a decree to take away all the property

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:05.900
of the Russian Orthodox Church.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.900
The ruling of the Sastoretsky District Court has no precedent in the history of modern Russia.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.500
According to normal human reasoning, this is robbery.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.579
It's the kind of violence, the same kind of violence that happened when worshippers were

00:04:22.579 --> 00:04:28.180
discriminated against because of their faith, or were insulted when their services were

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.180
being graded.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:38.420
Now they are trying to strip them off everything down to their very last possession.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.180
I think that the Russian government will have to start the same kind of partial restitution

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.860
of religious property that has been taken place since 2010 with regard to their Russian Orthodox

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.339
Church.

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:55.660
And the state will definitely have to return to the principles of freedom of religion

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.699
sooner or later.

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:03.139
This will mean returning to Jehovah's Witnesses everything that has been confiscated now.

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:07.699
If the cases hurt strictly in accordance with the law, we believe the decision of the

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:15.579
Sastoretsky District Court should be cancelled, and the prosecutors claim denied.

00:05:15.579 --> 00:05:21.220
If some other motive is prewell, well, we'll continue the appeal process.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.699
All the property that is being subject to seizure was dedicated by Jehovah's Witnesses to

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:31.740
Jehovah God, so we believe they are owned by God and are being taken away from God.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.819
But the Bible teaches us to throw all our anxiety on Him.
