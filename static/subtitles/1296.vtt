00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:10.910
The release of the revised version of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:20.500
in English language in 2013 had a wonderful impact on the English-speaking world.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.019
As Brother Jackson noted, more than 60 years at past since the release of the first volume

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:31.219
of the New World Translation, and during that time, the English language had changed as

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:36.640
well.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.679
During 2017, the revised version of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:52.350
has been released in some major European languages, such as Italian, originally released

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:03.189
in 1963, Dutch also originally released in 1963, Greek originally released in 1997,

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:08.109
and Hungarian originally released in 2000.

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:12.390
How do the brothers and sisters feel about the revised New World Translation in their

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.150
particular language?

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.629
The modern language in this revised version of the Bible helped me to understand Bible

00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:25.269
passages, because now it flows better and is much simpler.

00:01:25.269 --> 00:01:33.590
This helps me to meditate more on what I have just read.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.310
In Numbers 1424, Jehovah speaks to Moses.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.950
In the older version, Jehovah says about Caleb that a different spirit has proved to

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.099
be with him.

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:54.060
In the revised version, the verse reads, My servant Caleb thinks differently.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.060
Very clear?

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.540
Doesn't need further explanation.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.260
From 7.9, now says that Jehovah examines the hearts and the deepest emotions, whereas

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.379
previously it said, He examines the hearts and the kidneys.

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.900
Now it's easier to understand.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.060
Besides all the aspects helping to get a better understanding of God's Word, why are

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:29.099
brothers and sisters happy to use this revised version in field service?

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.340
In reading the scripture, you can tell people understand it more quickly.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.659
There's less need to explain more, and that's great.

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:42.979
I particularly like the glossary, it's a kind of mini-insight book.

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:48.740
It has been very useful when I study and also in the ministry.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.659
Furthermore I like that at the beginning of the Bible there are 20 introductions that

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:59.500
answer questions that people in the territory often ask, and they have Bible verses and

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.819
very nice illustrations, so they are very clear and practical.

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.819
To achieve such an awesome result by revising the New World translation, which important

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:17.949
aspects did the translators have to keep in mind?

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:23.150
Thanks to the modern language that is used in the revision, readers can understand most

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:30.150
Bible passages as they read them, without having to stop and read them over again.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.069
This is possible in part because the text is not cluttered with too many words, trying

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.750
to copy the Hebrew syntax and style of expression.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:49.509
Thus, the use of modern language contributes to naturalness and clarity.

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:55.789
The language used in the revision now also allows the emotions of the characters to come

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:57.469
through more vividly.

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:02.349
You straightaway notice when someone is angry or desperate or sad.

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.430
Take in Matthew 11 when Jesus invites us to take his yoga upon us.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.110
His warmth is immediately obvious.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.670
In the 2003 edition only one sentence was packed into these seven verses, and its length

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.709
was half a column, making it very cumbersome to follow the line of thought.

00:04:22.709 --> 00:04:28.069
In the revised Bible, this part was cut into more sentences, so it is easier to grasp

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:31.310
the idea.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.949
Many parents have told us that now when they read the Bible with their children, they

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:41.819
don't have to stop to explain words, but the reading is much more enjoyable.

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:46.540
The revised New World translation will be made available in more languages in the near

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.579
future.

00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:55.420
We know that Jehovah wants all his people to listen as he speaks to them in clear, understandable

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.579
language.

00:04:58.579 --> 00:05:03.579
This will help us to come to know Jehovah even better, and our love for him will keep

00:05:03.579 --> 00:05:07.459
growing, while we read his word with joy.
