00:00:03.339 --> 00:00:08.339
Theocratic projects are largely built by volunteers from all over the world

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:14.339
Speaking different languages from different cultural backgrounds with different work practices

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:18.339
Things that could divide and create barriers

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:23.879
One of the biggest challenges for me has been the language

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:27.879
Above all, the accents and the way people speak

00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:31.879
The ways of construction are a bit different to what I'm used to

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:34.880
That can create a challenge. You might be used to doing something one way

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.880
And then here we do it differently because of different circumstances

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.880
Initially we thought that with the similar language things would be the same

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.880
But even with the similar language we learn that there are differences

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.880
And how we speak and the things that we say

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.880
One of the things that I think probably got us when we first arrived was the greeting

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.880
We're used to just saying hello and a lot of times we would be greeted with

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.880
Hey, you're okay

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.879
After being asked that several times in the same day you begin to question

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.879
Whether or not you actually are right

00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:08.879
That's just how they say hello here

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:12.879
In the culture we're from people are a bit more straightforward

00:01:12.879 --> 00:01:15.879
And to the point when they're given instructions which they're not being rude

00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:18.879
It's just the way we do it there

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:23.879
Here I learned that it's nice to ask how are you, how's your day, how was your weekend maybe

00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:25.879
And then get to the point

00:01:25.879 --> 00:01:30.879
It's something that I've gotten used to and I really like it because you get to know the brothers that you work with

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:33.879
There are different ways for saying the same thing

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:34.879
No, I'm smiling please

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:38.879
And the differences aren't really all that big since you don't know it

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:43.879
It becomes a challenge to kind of understand it first but makes it a little more exciting and a little fun

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:44.879
Is that one?

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:45.879
Yes

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:48.879
Oh, thank you, a wrench

00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:52.879
It might be a way of doing things at home that I'm used to and that I've been learning in school

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:54.879
And then here we do it differently

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:58.879
It's just a matter of obedience and you do as you're instructed

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:01.879
And at first you make questions like why are we doing it differently

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:06.879
But if you're patient and you wait then you realize that you've just learned another way of doing something

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:09.879
Give me something that is really nice to see

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:17.879
Is that when I try to learn the language the brothers help me and that's a real blessing

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:25.150
Us taking our time to kind of learn about the culture has really helped us to kind of understand why things are different

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.150
And then when you understand why they're different it doesn't really bother you

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.150
You kind of understand your brothers and sisters and it makes it easier for you to love them and be positive

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.150
It realized that we are the ones that we have to adapt to the new culture, the new nation

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.150
We have to have Christ mentality, he came to serve not to be served

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.150
Spiritual things keep us united

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:55.150
To not see the negatives in other cultures, accents and word practices

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:02.150
Although there may be deadlines, constraints keeping our spirituality up is of the utmost importance

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.150
Our overseers reminded us of three non-negotiable things

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.150
Our meeting attendance, the film ministry and our family worship

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:18.150
Spirituality is everything when it comes to overcoming challenges because if you don't have a spiritual view of things then you will struggle

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.150
Continues to be more evident is that if we take care of our spirituality then Jehovah will take care of the rest

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.150
The work will get done

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.150
So the key to unity here on site is that everyone is working on the fruit of the spirit

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.150
We need to be patient, kind, loving, long-suffering

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:41.150
They exhibit these qualities that really pursue peace and it makes it easy, it makes it fun

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.150
You realize, you know what, we're just working with family

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.150
And of course, Jehovah's spirit is clearly shown in everything that we do

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:55.150
Having all of the different brothers and sisters and the different cultures is special and it really does help you grow

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.150
When I worked before, differences were an issue

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:05.150
It's beautiful to see, however, that here it doesn't matter where you are from

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.150
What job you are doing, we are all on the same level, we are all equal

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:16.149
It makes you think of revelations every night where the Scripture talks about people of every tribe and nation and tongue

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:21.149
We're one family and instead of just reading about it when we're here we experience it

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:30.060
When Nimrod was building the Tower of Babel, Jehovah used language to halt the project

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:36.060
Yet today, working on a project with so many different languages and cultures

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.060
Jehovah is unifying them to make his project successful
