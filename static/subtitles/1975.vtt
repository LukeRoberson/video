00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.219
and introduction to the Book of Jude.

00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:11.050
The Jude or Judas who wrote this inspired letter

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:17.050
was evidently the same Judas named as a half-brother of Jesus Christ.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:24.050
Jude wrote his letter about 65 CE, likely from his Jewish homeland.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.050
At the time, a threatening situation had developed.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.049
Immoral, animalistic men had begun to slip into the congregation.

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:38.049
So Jude stressed the need for Christians to put up a hard fight for the faith.

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:43.390
The letter of Jude has 25 verses.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:50.390
In verse 5, Jude reminds us that Jehovah, after delivering his people from Egypt,

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.390
destroyed the Israelites who showed a gross lack of faith.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.390
Likewise, verse 7 says that Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.390
are a warning example by undergoing the judicial punishment of everlasting fire.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.390
Using powerful metaphors, verses 12 and 13 described the wicked intruders

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.390
who enter into the Christian congregation as rocks hidden below water.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.390
As waterless clouds carried here and there by the wind,

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.390
as fruitless trees that had been uprooted,

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.390
and as wild waves of the sea that cast up the foam.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.390
Did you know Jude's letter has information not found elsewhere in the Bible.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.390
Jude alone mentions the archangel Michael's dispute with the devil over Moses' body.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.390
And only Jude mentions Enoch's prophecy that God, using myriads of angels,

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.390
would execute judgment against the wicked.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:00.700
Jude concludes his letter by urging his brothers to keep themselves in God's love,

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.700
to continue showing mercy to some who have doubts and to save them by snatching them out of the fire.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:16.430
As you read Jude's letter, note his many references to examples of God's judgments,

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:23.430
meditate on his vivid illustrations, and observe how concerned he was about the purity

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.430
and spirituality of those who hoped to inherit God's kingdom.
