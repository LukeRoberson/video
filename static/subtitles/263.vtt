00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:16.510
I love music.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.910
When I sing, I feel I can do or be anything.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.160
It sets me free.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.159
My classmates tell me to pursue what I want.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:45.479
And my teachers think that I can have a career doing what I love.

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:50.280
Wouldn't it be awesome to be a famous musician who is known by everyone?

00:00:50.280 --> 00:01:08.329
I know I would never leave Jehovah,

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:12.129
but would it be so wrong to get my career sorted first

00:01:12.129 --> 00:01:16.140
and then serve Jehovah whole soul?

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.939
Now I have an offer that can do that.

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.540
You see, our family has never had a lot of money.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.540
And this could change everything.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:43.769
We could be rich.

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:48.170
When I told Dad my plans how we could have more money,

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:55.159
he was really grateful I wanted to help.

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.159
He liked the idea of using my talent.

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:04.719
But he also mentioned someone who I had never thought about.

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:07.519
Someone who had many opportunities in life

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:09.919
and needed to make a choice.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:14.330
Moses.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.729
Dad left me to think about Hebrews chapter 11

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:21.129
verses 24 to 26.

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.930
By faith, Moses, when grown up,

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.129
refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.330
choosing to be mistreated with the people of God,

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.930
rather than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.129
Because he considered the reproach of the Christ

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.930
to be riches greater than the treasures of Egypt,

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.740
for he looked intently toward the payment of the reward.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.539
Moses had it all.

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:54.340
Yet he knew that while living in that Egyptian palace,

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.539
he could never give Jehovah 100%.

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:00.340
There were too many temptations.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.539
Idol worship, spiritism, materialism.

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:11.500
He rejected this lifestyle and chose to serve Jehovah.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.300
Clearly, Moses made the right career choice.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.900
What would my career be?

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.099
Even if I am successful,

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.900
is the dream that they are selling me a reality?

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.340
Or will they throw me out as soon as the next big thing comes along?

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.139
What are the risks in morality, materialism?

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:41.680
Would I have the strength to resist these?

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.280
What a change, one scripture,

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.060
and thinking things through can make.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.259
My teachers and classmates may never understand

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:56.259
why I chose not to pursue a career in music,

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:57.860
but that's okay.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.060
The career I chose gives me purpose and happiness now

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:11.199
and has an eternal future.

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:15.800
Now, instead of being the only thing I do in life,

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.199
teaching music helps me to support my career,

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:26.199
pioneering.

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:33.680
My life is free of regret.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.480
What career choice will you make?
