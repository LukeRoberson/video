00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:06.379
Before our Lord Jesus returned to heaven,

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:09.980
He gave what has been called the Great Commission.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.119
He said,

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:16.019
go there for and make disciples of people of all the nations,

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:18.820
baptizing them in the name of the Father

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.320
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.660
No doubt you have those words in your mind as well.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.700
Jesus was not satisfied that people should just come to know his teachings.

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:36.799
Jesus wanted people to come to love his teachings

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:39.079
so that they would act on them,

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.579
so that they would live by them

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.780
and so that they would become his true disciples.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.259
Now, why did Jesus want people to become his disciples

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:52.420
and live by his teachings?

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.219
Well, it's because of something that we read here

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.299
in John chapter 13 and verse 17.

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:01.380
Now, notice what Jesus said here.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.500
If you know these things,

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.980
happy you are if you do them.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.620
What's the point?

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.260
Jesus was saying that people would find real happiness.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.700
They would find the way of salvation.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.900
They would have a relationship with his precious Heavenly Father

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.700
if they would just come to know and do the things that he had taught.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.500
Well, brothers and sisters, in this symposium,

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.980
we are going to discuss five different things

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.540
that our Bible students need to do,

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.579
that they need to progress in

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.700
if they are going to become true disciples of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.060
Let's talk about the first.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.140
What is the most basic need that our Bible students have?

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.340
Well, it's what Jesus talked about here in Matthew chapter 5.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.500
Let's read it together.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.099
Matthew chapter 5 and verse 3.

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.379
Jesus said, happy are those conscious of their notice?

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:12.379
Spiritual need since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.020
What's the point?

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.020
Well, Jesus showed that honest-hearted people have a spiritual need.

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:23.379
They have a need to come to know God

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.419
and to have a relationship with him.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.460
If they're really going to be happy.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.460
Therefore, we need to teach our Bible students the very first thing

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.580
to see how they can fill that spiritual need

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.419
by learning about their Heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:44.060
As they fill that need,

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.900
as they come to have that relationship with God,

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.419
that is the way to true happiness.

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:55.180
That means more than just feeding people information.

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:58.379
You know, there's a saying that's very familiar to most of us.

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.780
It says, give a man a fish, feed him for a day.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.900
Teach him how to fish, feed him for a lifetime.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.580
What's the point?

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.860
If we can teach our Bible students how to feed themselves spiritually,

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.460
then they have the way in front of them

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.860
to a close relationship with God,

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.860
to strong faith and becoming real disciples of Jesus Christ.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.740
Well, now in the following demonstration that you'll see on video,

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:53.280
just notice how our Bible teacher helps her student to be able to do this.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.879
Got it.

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:57.879
I find the answers in all that.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.439
It's more than just the answers.

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:03.840
I'm with it. I'm all about study.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.960
Which do you remember more from our studies?

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.520
The answers?

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.080
Or the things that touch your heart?

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.079
Yeah.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.319
Like, when we talked about immorality,

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:23.920
you knew the answer,

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:32.160
but you didn't seem totally convinced in here.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.660
Let's try and find that answer.

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:47.040
But whoever practices sexual immorality

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:53.519
is sinning against his own body.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.639
Not sure why,

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.439
but it made me think of Mum and Dad.

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:02.959
His constant cheating, actually.

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:05.399
Mum's humiliation,

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:08.439
the divorce, all the misery.

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:17.600
I didn't want that.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.120
I began to realize how right Jehovah is.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.199
Because of what need to call meditation,

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:30.399
it's not about clearing your mind to find inner peace.

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:32.000
It's totally different.

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:37.720
It's asking how Jehovah feels about something.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:48.170
And then what that means for me.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.649
Now, what did you notice in the video?

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:54.170
It's true, Nita showed her Bible student the tools.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.170
But what more did she do?

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.329
She also helped her to see that the answers

00:06:00.329 --> 00:06:02.129
were not the most important thing.

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:05.209
The most important thing was having the information

00:06:05.209 --> 00:06:08.370
come to touch her heart so that she would be moved

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.810
to act on what she learned.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.850
Well, how can we help our students

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.529
to be able to feed themselves spiritually?

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:18.689
Well, from the very beginning,

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:20.970
once the study has been established,

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.209
we want to teach our students how to prepare

00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:26.209
each week for the study.

00:06:26.209 --> 00:06:28.569
Now, this might be something very new to them.

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:30.089
So we're going to have to go through it

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:33.569
step by step showing them how to prepare.

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:36.410
It might also involve having to help them see

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.329
how they can buy out time from their schedule

00:06:39.329 --> 00:06:43.730
so that they can do what's necessary to prepare.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.050
And then don't forget to commend them

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.329
because this might be very new for many of our students

00:06:49.329 --> 00:06:51.329
when they make the effort to prepare,

00:06:51.329 --> 00:06:53.569
make sure you give appropriate commendation.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.089
But then what's the next thing?

00:06:57.089 --> 00:07:00.170
This is something that we sometimes forget, brothers.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.329
It's the need to teach our students to pray

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.410
before every single study session.

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.769
Now, why is this important?

00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:11.569
Well, once again, we want our students

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:16.009
not just to be thinking in terms of acquiring information

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:20.050
to not take an academic approach to their study,

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.769
but instead be always thinking about

00:07:22.769 --> 00:07:25.850
how what they're studying connects them

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.290
with their Heavenly Father Jehovah

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:32.490
so that they're building up a relationship with him

00:07:32.529 --> 00:07:34.930
as Proverbs chapter two says,

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.730
if we call out to Jehovah for knowledge,

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.529
for wisdom, for understanding,

00:07:40.529 --> 00:07:42.250
Jehovah will help us.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:44.970
He'll help our student to gain that knowledge

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.889
that they need to build up a good relationship with him.

00:07:48.889 --> 00:07:51.649
And then we want to do practical things.

00:07:51.649 --> 00:07:54.610
We want to help our students to become familiar

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:58.930
with the digital tools that we have at our disposal for study.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.170
That means helping them to install

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.529
on their phone, on their tablet,

00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:07.129
or whatever device they have, JW Library,

00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:10.810
showing them how to use Watchtower Online Library

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.449
so that they can get the answers that they need

00:08:13.449 --> 00:08:14.810
to their questions.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.850
Do you know as a February of this year,

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:21.569
Watchtower Online Library is now available

00:08:21.569 --> 00:08:24.930
in more than 700 languages.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:28.050
So virtually, people all over the world

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:31.410
have access to these wonderful tools.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.490
Don't forget also to show them JW.org

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.490
and JW Broadcasting

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.009
and show them how they can keep up to date

00:08:39.009 --> 00:08:41.529
with these wonderful provisions from Jehovah.

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:46.450
Well now, we've shown them how to prepare for their lesson.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.370
We've shown them how to use the online tools,

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:52.769
but what are the next progressive steps we want to take

00:08:52.769 --> 00:08:56.169
so that they can feed themselves spiritually?

00:08:56.169 --> 00:08:59.210
Well of course, as Psalm 1 tells us,

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:04.009
if we want to be truly happy and truly well fed spiritually,

00:09:04.009 --> 00:09:09.009
we have to read God's law in an undertone day and night.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:12.090
So we want to teach our students

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:15.370
to get into that good habit of reading God's word

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:18.049
the Bible every day.

00:09:18.049 --> 00:09:19.649
And then what about the next step?

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.769
We want our students also to be able to prepare

00:09:23.769 --> 00:09:25.490
for congregation meetings.

00:09:25.529 --> 00:09:29.330
Now, if we've shown them how to use JW Library,

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.409
this is really easy, isn't it?

00:09:31.409 --> 00:09:34.769
All we have to do is basically hit that meeting tab

00:09:34.769 --> 00:09:37.570
and when we do, well, all the information

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:40.649
for our midweek meeting and our weekend meeting

00:09:40.649 --> 00:09:42.690
is all there for us.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.970
It will help our students to see

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:48.009
that this program of spiritual feeding

00:09:48.009 --> 00:09:50.129
is something they can access

00:09:50.129 --> 00:09:52.049
and something they can benefit from.

00:09:52.929 --> 00:09:55.690
And what about research questions?

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:59.009
Now, brothers and sisters, if you have a good student,

00:09:59.009 --> 00:10:02.289
they're going to be asking lots of questions.

00:10:02.289 --> 00:10:04.450
And this is where it's sometimes difficult

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:06.090
for us as teachers.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.570
We would like to be able to just rush in,

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:10.809
open our Bible and answer every question

00:10:10.809 --> 00:10:12.730
that our student has.

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:15.090
But what's the better course?

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:17.049
Well, we want to be modest.

00:10:17.049 --> 00:10:20.850
And instead of answering all the questions for them,

00:10:20.889 --> 00:10:24.769
how much better it is to go back to those tools,

00:10:24.769 --> 00:10:27.049
go back to the JW Library,

00:10:27.049 --> 00:10:29.929
go back to Watchtower Online Library

00:10:29.929 --> 00:10:33.210
and show the student how they can find the answers

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:36.129
to their own Bible questions.

00:10:36.129 --> 00:10:40.850
As we do that, we're helping them to build for the future.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.490
Well, brothers, if we can do this,

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:45.690
if we can accomplish this goal

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:50.409
of teaching our students how to feed themselves spiritually,

00:10:50.409 --> 00:10:52.889
we are not just feeding them today.

00:10:52.889 --> 00:10:56.450
We're not just handing them a fish, as it were.

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:59.889
Instead, we're teaching them how to fish.

00:10:59.889 --> 00:11:03.690
We're teaching them how to feed themselves spiritually

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:05.570
for a lifetime.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:09.129
Even more important, we're fulfilling the commission

00:11:09.129 --> 00:11:10.809
that Jesus gave us.

00:11:10.809 --> 00:11:14.929
We are making real disciples of Christ Jesus,

00:11:14.929 --> 00:11:17.169
who are well fed spiritually.

00:11:17.169 --> 00:11:20.330
And as a result, they will not wither up

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.090
or they will not blow away,

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:25.009
but instead they will stand firm

00:11:25.009 --> 00:11:28.049
as true disciples of Christ Jesus.

00:11:29.169 --> 00:11:32.649
Brother Ronald Curson, a helper with the Teaching Committee,

00:11:32.649 --> 00:11:35.850
will now consider the next talk in this symposium,

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:38.850
help your Bible students to attend meetings.
