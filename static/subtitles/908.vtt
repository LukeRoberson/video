00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.060
Mom, let me carry that.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.059
I got it, Irene.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:32.299
You know, I'm not that old.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.299
You know, I really like that doctor.

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:40.609
What was he, 15?

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:44.609
You know, he's not going to be practicing on me.

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:46.609
I'm going to keep packing yourself, okay?

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:47.609
Okay, dear.

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:58.009
Irene, don't forget my therapy appointment

00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:00.009
on Wednesday morning.

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:02.009
I can't on Wednesday.

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:06.450
Let me ask Elena.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.450
I just need you to finish filling out the second page here

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.450
and then sign in, date at the bottom,

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.450
and then we'll be good to go.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.450
Okay, thank you.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:20.379
What do you need, Irene?

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:22.379
Hello, do you, too?

00:01:22.379 --> 00:01:25.379
Mom needs you to take her to an appointment on Wednesday.

00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:28.980
No, I can't.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.980
Can you just keep your preaching thing or whatever?

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.980
I have to work at a real job.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:40.099
I've had my hands full.

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:43.099
I just need a little more help.

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:46.099
Irene, I'll see what I can do.

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:52.459
But no promises.

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:55.459
Well, I can tell Elena's not going to be much help,

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:57.459
but I'll figure it out.

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:01.459
You know, your sister had a tough year.

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:04.739
You should study with her.

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:07.739
You know, we have tried so many times.

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:11.430
She doesn't want to study.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:33.979
I think you're just too hard on her, Irene.

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:35.979
Shifts, so I could take mom on Wednesday.

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:38.979
You owe me a little misrighteous.

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:41.979
Maybe she would study.

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:43.979
What, Elena?

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:45.979
There's nothing I can do.

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:48.979
Wouldn't she close growing up?

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:50.979
Grandma thinks you can reach her heart.

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:54.979
Yeah, well, grandma also thinks she can live on her own.

00:02:54.979 --> 00:03:11.539
Okay.

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:14.539
I know you tried, but...

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:16.539
Just don't stop trying, okay?

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:23.469
Okay.

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:27.469
Did you notice how forgetful grandma was getting?

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:39.030
Yeah.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.030
With all humility and mildness,

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.030
with patience,

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.030
putting up with one another in love.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.030
Thank you for the best.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:55.639
What did I do wrong now?

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:56.639
Nothing.

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:01.139
I just wanted to say thank you.

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:02.139
And?

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:05.780
And how are you doing?

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.780
I really miss talking to my little sister.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.360
No judgment?

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:21.600
No judgment.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.600
I don't know if you know this.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.600
But I went to see mom the other day.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:31.569
She was taking out pictures of us and working.

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:54.240
So this is your room here on the right.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.240
This is nice.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.240
Thank you.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.240
You're welcome.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.240
You're welcome.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.240
What you get settled in, okay?

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.240
Lovey grandma.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.240
So, do you want anything else?

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.240
Irene, you know this is not what I wanted.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:42.860
Mom, where's all my kitchen stuff?

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.860
We organized and changed out some things.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.970
We?

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.970
The girls and I did.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:56.750
You know, it's not your thing, Irene.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.750
We decided my stuff is better.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:00.750
You'll see.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:18.360
Hey babe.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.360
Are you okay?

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.360
Max, how many times have I asked you to take your shoes off at the door?

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.360
Sorry, I keep forgetting.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.360
I was just making sure you were okay.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.360
Just clean.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:44.050
And it's like you don't even care about how hard I work.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.050
Can you pass me the salt, please?

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.050
Sure.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.050
Thank you.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.930
These need more than salt.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.930
Irene, why didn't you make these homemade?

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:06.519
They are.

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:08.519
I think they're great.

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:09.519
Thanks.

00:07:09.519 --> 00:07:35.370
I'm sorry about earlier.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.839
Yeah, me too.

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:46.230
These past few months, I didn't expect them to be so hard.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:56.439
And I'm really sorry about what this is doing to us.

00:07:56.439 --> 00:07:59.439
We're in this together.

00:07:59.439 --> 00:08:04.439
You know, Jehovah sees everything you're doing for your mother.

00:08:04.439 --> 00:08:31.500
And he's so proud of you.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.500
Hey, thanks for getting me.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.500
Yeah, anytime.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.500
How was work?

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.500
It's going well.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:36.500
It's been so long.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.500
Hey, do you know what?

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:39.500
Hey.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:40.500
Oh, yeah.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.500
Hey, man, I'm so glad I caught you.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:47.500
So, I wanted to get your phone number just in case any work stuff comes up after hours.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.500
You know?

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.500
Is that okay?

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.500
Yeah, okay.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:59.500
It's 646-480-6649.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.500
Okay, I got it.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.500
If anything comes up, I'll be sure to give you a shout, all right?

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.500
Okay, cool.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.500
See you more.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.500
All right, see you all.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.500
Hey, actually.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:18.500
I just, I was about to grab something to eat and I wanted to see if you wanted to come with me.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.500
No, thanks.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.500
We've really got you going.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.500
Next time for sure then.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.500
I'll see you tomorrow.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.820
Yeah.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.820
What was that all about?

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.190
It's nothing.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:35.190
I hope not.

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:37.190
Trust me.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:49.840
It's nothing.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:56.289
I can guess who that is.

00:09:56.289 --> 00:09:57.289
Who's that?

00:09:57.289 --> 00:10:00.289
Just a doctor from work.

00:10:00.289 --> 00:10:02.289
Wow, he's persistent.

00:10:02.289 --> 00:10:04.289
He's persistent?

00:10:04.289 --> 00:10:06.289
Wait, is he interested in you?

00:10:06.289 --> 00:10:07.289
I guess.

00:10:07.289 --> 00:10:09.289
When were you going to tell me about this?

00:10:09.289 --> 00:10:10.289
There's nothing to tell.

00:10:10.289 --> 00:10:12.289
You told them no, right?

00:10:12.289 --> 00:10:13.289
I haven't.

00:10:13.289 --> 00:10:14.289
I don't.

00:10:14.289 --> 00:10:16.289
Wait, you haven't told him no?

00:10:16.289 --> 00:10:17.289
No.

00:10:17.289 --> 00:10:18.289
Not yet.

00:10:18.289 --> 00:10:19.289
I've taught you better than that.

00:10:19.289 --> 00:10:23.289
You know you have to be firm from the start.

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:24.289
It's not that simple.

00:10:24.289 --> 00:10:25.289
It is that simple.

00:10:25.289 --> 00:10:27.289
And you need to do it now.

00:10:27.289 --> 00:11:01.129
I'm sorry.

00:11:01.129 --> 00:11:03.129
I overreacted.

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:07.529
I want you to know I do trust you.

00:11:07.529 --> 00:11:11.779
I've never had a reason not to.

00:11:11.779 --> 00:11:14.779
I know.

00:11:14.779 --> 00:11:16.779
But I'm not a teenager anymore.

00:11:16.779 --> 00:11:22.789
You're not, but I'm always going to be your dad.

00:11:22.789 --> 00:11:24.789
And dad's worried about their kids.

00:11:24.789 --> 00:11:31.720
It's just part of the job.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.720
I really need this job to pioneer.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.860
What if he doesn't take it well?

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.860
That could happen.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:45.940
But then you'll get to see what Jehovah will do.

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:53.120
I'll talk with him tomorrow.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:57.100
Is there anything I can do to help?

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.100
Maybe say a prayer for me.

00:12:00.100 --> 00:13:05.049
I'd love to.

00:13:05.049 --> 00:13:06.049
Do you want some fresh air?

00:13:06.049 --> 00:13:12.460
There you go.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:41.299
I'm getting hot.

00:13:41.299 --> 00:13:42.299
I got it.

00:13:42.299 --> 00:13:43.299
I got it.

00:13:43.299 --> 00:13:44.299
Mom, okay.

00:13:44.299 --> 00:14:02.070
Mom.

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:05.070
It's not time to take your pills.

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:08.070
Mom, it's not time.

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:09.070
I want to take my pills.

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:10.070
It's not time.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:11.070
I want to take my pills.

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:12.070
Mom, stop.

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:14.070
I really want to take my pills.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:18.820
Take you back.

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:25.940
How long it takes me to do this?

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:28.940
I'm not taking those dirty pills.

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:34.940
Mom, why do you have to make everything so hard?

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.940
I'm sorry.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:15:07.889
Maybe it won't be so difficult for you when I'm gone.

00:15:07.889 --> 00:15:11.580
I know this is hard for you.

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:22.200
It's hard for the both of us.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.200
I don't know how to make it any better.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:29.070
I know.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:40.350
But I love you.

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:42.350
And I want to do this for you.

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:53.500
I love you too, Irene.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:16:05.690
Psalm 71.14 says,

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:10.690
But as for me, I will continue to wait.

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:14.690
When we're patient, good things happen.

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:18.860
We preach.

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:23.809
We help each other do what's right.

00:16:23.809 --> 00:16:29.529
We take care of the people we love.

00:16:29.529 --> 00:16:54.620
And we give Jehovah time to bless our patients.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:17:00.320
Thank you.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.320
I just got back from service.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.320
Hey, Wana.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.319
Hey.

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:05.319
What's going on?

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:10.319
Well, I got this in the mail.

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:18.269
Do you have time to talk?

00:17:18.269 --> 00:17:19.269
Sure.
