00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:15.580
Well, it's finally happened. You think you found the person of your dreams, and now you're hopelessly in love

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:18.579
Or are you?

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.420
How can you tell if it's really love?

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:28.339
The key is you've got to learn the differences between attraction and

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.619
Fatuation

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.780
and actual love

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:44.579
Attraction is based on what you see. You know how a person looks and acts. The problem is what you see

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:52.179
isn't always what you get

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:54.420
So then what is infatuation?

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.929
Infatuation is not only about what you see. It's about how you feel.

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.129
You may have romantic feelings, but those feelings can change.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.930
And fast

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.370
Infatuation may seem like love, but because it's based only on how you feel at the moment

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.069
It can just fall apart

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.469
So how do you know if it's really love? One that will last

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:30.030
Real love grows when two people are kind

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.790
Hard working and share the same spiritual outlook

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.510
At first Corinthians 13 verse 5 the Bible says that real love doesn't look for its own interests

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.269
For example that guy you like so much

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.829
How does he handle money? Does he have to drink alcohol to have a good time?

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:54.989
What are his goals?

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.549
Is he really working toward them?

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.310
Or is he all talk and no action?

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.579
And what about that girl you just can't stop thinking about

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.810
Who are her friends?

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:18.860
How does she treat them? How does she treat her family?

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.560
There's a lot to learn about another person

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.240
It takes time

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:29.520
So before you get swept off your feet

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.120
Remember attraction is based on what you see

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.639
infatuation is based on what you feel

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.599
But real love is based on what you know
