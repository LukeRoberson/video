00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:02.910
You know, we've been talking about times

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.910
when our loyalty has been put to the test.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.910
And not to put you on the spot,

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.910
but didn't you have an experience?

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.910
Mm-hmm.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.910
I did.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.910
And I don't mind sharing.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.910
It was when I was at that office job in the city.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.910
It was just coffee as usual.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.910
Karen, we're making some coffee.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.910
Did you want some?

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:29.910
Oh, I love it.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.910
The good stuff, right?

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:31.910
Oh, yes.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:32.909
Thanks.

00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:35.909
Boy, I can smell it.

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:37.909
And it's my bread treats.

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:38.909
It's wonderful.

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:40.909
Thank you.

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:43.909
But this time she started telling me about her problems at home.

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:46.909
So, John, he got a text message from his ex-girlfriend.

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:48.909
No, that must be very hard for you.

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:50.909
Yeah, it is.

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:52.909
You know, there are some things in the Bible

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:54.909
that have helped me in my marriage,

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:55.909
but I would love to show you.

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:57.909
I was excited about the chance to give a witness.

00:00:57.909 --> 00:00:58.909
Hey, good morning.

00:00:58.909 --> 00:00:59.909
Hey, good morning.

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:00.909
Is that for me?

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:01.909
I know how you like it.

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:02.909
Oh, thank you.

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:04.909
From time to time, we talked,

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.909
kept the conversations brief.

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:08.909
And that was it.

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:09.909
Hey!

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.909
But over time, the conversations grew.

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.909
And husbands and family were often the hot topic.

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.909
And everyone had a few points.

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.909
If I may, there's some things on the scriptures that I think.

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.909
I still thought I could give a witness

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.909
and actually teach them something about Jehovah.

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.909
Honey, it doesn't work like that.

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.909
Oh, right.

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:37.909
Sorry, Karen.

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.909
Too much information, right?

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:40.909
You know, with a husband.

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.909
But in reality, I was the one being taught.

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.859
And I was a quick learner.

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:54.590
I was sure their thinking wasn't rubbing off on me

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.590
until one day when Robert called.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.590
The girls knew that Robert and I had had a small disagreement

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.590
that morning.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.590
And he was calling to apologize.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.590
Although some of it was my fault.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.590
Karen, did you want to get a little coffee?

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.219
If you don't want to talk to him now, then don't.

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:18.219
Besides, it sounds like he could use a little silent treatment.

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:28.069
I couldn't believe the effect the association was having

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.069
on my attitude and my marriage.

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.069
But what could you do?

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.069
You worked with them every day.

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.069
And you were able to give a witness sometimes.

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.069
But I had let it turn into regular, unnecessary association

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.069
that was spoiling my useful habits.

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.400
And that had to change.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.400
I started keeping things friendly, but professional.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.400
I was more cautious as I would be if they had invited me out

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.099
or if a male coworker had invited me to join him for a break.

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.099
So did that work.

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:09.099
It did.

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.099
And I was so relieved.

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.099
And so was I.

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:19.099
Jehovah gave us the good morals and habits that we have.

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:26.099
Exposing myself to bad association was being disloyal to him.

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:51.310
When I think how far we are now into the...

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.310
I'll sit out there.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.310
It's not good.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.310
Long, maybe an hour.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.310
Is Kevin with you?

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.879
He said he's not coming.

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:08.060
Then he doesn't want to have anything to do with us anymore.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.060
How sad.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.060
Now, just far into the great tribulation.
