00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.490
Music can touch our heart without saying a word.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.689
In film, the happy moment comes on the screen,

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:13.689
it can you get a streamer of happy music

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:17.690
and it prepares the mind for what's the common.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:24.089
What began is live orchestra and commercial recordings

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:27.089
used on our convention programs

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:29.089
led to setting up our own orchestra

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:32.090
to record all the musical needs for the organization.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.740
For the past 40 years, brothers and sisters

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.740
have come from all over the world

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.740
to record music for use in worship and for our videos.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.740
It's been my dream my whole life

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.740
to play in the orchestra here to play for Jehovah.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.740
We are so passionate about music,

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.740
but we're also very passionate about the truth.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.740
But here we can combine two things we love the most.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.740
My mother is piano teacher,

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.739
but I was so active child.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.739
She recommended me Marimba.

00:01:08.739 --> 00:01:12.739
I love coming here. It's very special.

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:17.269
My brothers start to play the violin first.

00:01:17.269 --> 00:01:20.269
So kind of he teach me a lot.

00:01:20.269 --> 00:01:22.269
And you?

00:01:22.269 --> 00:01:25.579
I work in talent branch

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:27.579
and we're doing the audio recording

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:30.579
and for the brother and sister who speak Mandarin Chinese.

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:34.579
We need to use our talent to serve Jehovah.

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:36.579
Music comes from Jehovah.

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:38.579
It's always been part of his worship.

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.579
I'm a regular pioneer,

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.579
so I spend a certain amount of time teaching the Bible.

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.579
But I support myself by working in an orchestra.

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:54.280
I work at the Korea branch.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.280
It has been a good experience.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.280
Being able to play with brothers and sisters

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.280
from so many different backgrounds.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.280
It's a very good experience.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.980
I come from a musical family,

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.979
obviously with dad playing guitar.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.979
My mom's family is quite musical to you.

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:16.979
As long time since I've done recording,

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:20.979
I've still changed a lot since back in the 60s.

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:22.979
We flew in,

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:24.979
and we're now here with the orchestra

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:27.979
just about to start the recording session.

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:34.300
When the combination of notes are put together

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.300
and some marvelous chords, some marvelous writing,

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.300
it can go to the depths of the heart.
