00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.920
Finding a way to get everybody five people at the same time to have a whole evening together, it can be a challenge.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.920
I wondered whether I would be able to make our family worship interesting and beneficial.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.920
I was not very confident.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.920
A challenge for me is my own attitude toward family worship.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.920
I would hang out with my friends from the congregation.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.920
Children like it when you are interested in them.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.920
Spend time with them.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.920
But you don't always have the time and energy needed.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.920
I had to provide financially for the family.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.920
I was always tired and worn out.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.299
So it was very hard to have family worship regularly.

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:05.299
Kenzie of course is special needs.

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:13.299
And she has heard challenges and there's times when it just doesn't work.

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:18.299
Sometimes my dad would make us attend family worship when they actually want to go to bed.

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.299
It is quite annoying.

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.299
That's an honest reply.

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.299
We have three different age groups.

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.299
We have a teenager, we have a preteen, and we have a son who is very active, hyper.

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.299
My husband not being a worshiper of Jehovah.

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.299
Might have different plans for the family.

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.989
When family worship arrangement was introduced,

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:44.989
it became part of our service in Jehovah.

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:47.989
We never miss a congregation meeting.

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:49.989
So why should we miss the family worship?

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:54.989
Whether I'm tired or not, the consistency of having family worship is very important.

00:01:54.989 --> 00:02:00.989
It really requires discipline because sometimes there's things that we want to do.

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:04.989
And we just know well, family studies is what's most important, so we have to give that up.

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:15.400
My friends and the brothers in the congregation often call me to exercise or play sports.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.580
Since family worship day doesn't change each week,

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.580
it becomes easier to turn them down.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:33.580
I've said to the girls, let's try to push each other.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.580
Let's try to encourage each other because it's not easy.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.580
I feel it has to start with me making that time and effort to live work on time

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.580
in order to be able to honor our family worship.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.580
I became confident that this can really be successful.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.580
I think the most important is the love we have with Jehovah

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.580
that keeps us going. I think that's our motivation.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.580
We are determined to teach her as much as we possibly can

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.580
and that she'll possibly understand so that the truth will mean everything to her too.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.580
We'll keep being.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.909
We're a family and things pop up.

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:21.909
Something can come up unexpectedly.

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:26.909
So when we need to cover it or the anger.

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:28.909
We make it relaxing.

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:33.909
The children look forward to getting cake or fruit or something else

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:37.909
so that they doesn't get strict and reach it.

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:40.909
We have to know when to be flexible.

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:46.909
When you have children, we feel that you have to make small short sessions

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.909
so that they can concentrate on the subject being discussed.

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:55.909
I'm trying to teach them how to make small short sessions.

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:59.909
I think at older we had to change their methods.

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:02.909
At times we invite brothers and their congregation.

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:08.909
We might get the kids to organize some questions so they can interview the brother or sister

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.909
that's coming over, especially if they're new in the congregation.

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:16.910
So sometimes family worship might be about issues that our family is facing.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.910
Sometimes it might be about things in the ministry that we want to try and accomplish.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.910
Sometimes it might be about games.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.910
So we've stretched out all over the floor and done all sorts of wonderful things for family worship

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.910
because it keeps people engaged.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.250
It's all about asking the family what they like to talk about.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.250
If a family is involved, it is a family worship.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.250
Rather than dad or myself setting out the agenda for family worship,

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.250
well then it'll be a dad's family worship not the whole family.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.250
But if we get the feedback from the whole family, from everyone,

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.250
everyone gets to put in ideas, then we just plan that accordingly.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.250
The reality of what we need now for relevance is we need to make sure that they're grounded

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.250
in their faith and belief.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.250
How they stood at every family study.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.250
We always try to focus on the kids' spiritual goals.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.250
Once the kid at school came and asked me if I could play for the football team.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.250
And I thought it was a good idea, so I went to dad and asked him.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.250
And then he said, why don't we try something called role reversals?

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.250
I would play the dad, he would play the son.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.250
In my case, the biggest pressure I have to face is dating in school.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.250
And family worship helps me a lot.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:33.250
Instead of allowing my problems and negative emotions to faster within me,

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:38.250
I shared this feeling with my family during family worship.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.250
Mom was very understanding.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:47.250
And she made an effort to come up with themes during family worship to address those issues.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.250
We decided to make a scroll of the book of Isaiah.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:58.250
It really helps me to realize that Jehovah's organization makes it easier for us to find the scriptures

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:05.250
that we're looking for and not to make it so complicated like in Jesus' days.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:13.250
But for me, the best thing is to have an opportunity to express myself.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:19.009
It's good sometimes to break it up a bit so it's not always like dad talking.

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:26.250
When I see how happy all the family members are after our family worship,

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:32.250
I would silently thank Jehovah for helping me fulfill my responsibility as the head of the household.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:37.250
Our children have learned to be more outgoing and participate more in the meetings.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:46.250
It was Jehovah's way of telling me, you are not alone.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.250
You have these precious children with you.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:55.250
It's just that I wasn't paying enough attention to them.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:01.170
Open with prayer and then right after that, it's just amazing. It's really fun.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:06.170
So getting there is the hard part but once we get into it, that's when it starts.

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.170
That's when it starts having fun.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:17.170
The family worship has been protecting my family and it has been preparing my family

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.170
for the difficulties we face.

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:25.170
We actually are more open with each other now than we ever were before

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:32.170
and we can discuss just about anything and everything which is actually good.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:37.170
Family worship made me realize how happy I am to have Jehovah as my God.

00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:43.629
And that I have many reasons to be happy.

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:48.629
It feels like I can just let go of what was making me sad,

00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:52.629
what was making me a bit angry and I can just feel like it's fine

00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:56.629
because I know everything will be okay and Jehovah's blessed our evening.

00:07:56.629 --> 00:08:02.629
As for me, I learned about the truth through family worship.

00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:11.629
I think it encourages me to keep being witness and not to the side of the truth.

00:08:11.629 --> 00:08:16.629
It also helps me understand what the meaning is about so I can pay attention

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:18.629
and it helps me get a comment.

00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:24.629
During his prayers, we are able to say that that relationship with Jehovah is really close

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:30.629
and this encourages me to also enjoy a close relationship with Jehovah.

00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:36.629
So family worship has taught me to preach boldly about the truth even at school.

00:08:38.629 --> 00:08:43.629
I was able to cut down association with worldly friends thanks to family worship.

00:08:54.629 --> 00:08:56.629
Now can you imagine if daddy said,

00:08:56.629 --> 00:09:00.629
you know what, on Mondays we're not going to do our family worship anymore.

00:09:00.629 --> 00:09:01.629
How would you feel about that?

00:09:01.629 --> 00:09:02.629
Sad.

00:09:02.629 --> 00:09:04.629
Why would you feel sad about that?

00:09:04.629 --> 00:09:06.629
Because I want to do it.

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:08.629
Tell me why you want to do it.

00:09:08.629 --> 00:09:16.629
So I can color the picture and find the missing pictures and read the Bible.

00:09:16.629 --> 00:09:17.629
Right.

00:09:17.629 --> 00:09:20.629
What do you think you think Jehovah is happy when you do things like that?

00:09:20.629 --> 00:09:25.629
Family worship is just so important.

00:09:25.629 --> 00:10:46.179
The right sacrifices.

00:10:46.179 --> 00:10:50.600
The choice.
