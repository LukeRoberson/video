00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.280
Hello, I'm Pyongcholium.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:16.030
Welcome to Iron Sharpen's Iron.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.390
Have you ever had this experience?

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.870
You share the truth with someone and you can see that it touches their heart.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.870
It's the best feeling isn't it?

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.949
And it makes you want to take the initiative to offer them a Bible study.

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.149
After all, we love God and people.

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.070
But at times we may hesitate to offer a study.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.350
We might worry about something pushy or being rejected.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:51.659
So what can we do to effectively offer a Bible study?

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:54.420
Hi, you're out for exercise again today.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.659
You're really diligent.

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:58.899
I've got to do at least this much to stay healthy.

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.659
But hey, look at this news.

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:04.980
I said so a few months ago, didn't I?

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.500
Why is the world such a mess?

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.500
True, but don't you think the world will get better someday?

00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:13.780
What do you think?

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.019
Can the world's problems be solved by people's efforts?

00:01:17.019 --> 00:01:18.859
If anything, it'll get worse.

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:20.260
What can people do?

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.579
Well, if people are powerless, do you think there's another way?

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:26.019
Another way?

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:30.859
Hmm, doesn't seem likely.

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:33.340
Our brother did an excellent job.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.299
He showed personal interest, was a good listener, and asked appropriate questions.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.620
But can you guess what he did next?

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.819
He offered a brief, silent prayer to Jehovah for help.

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:50.060
When offering a Bible study, prayer is the first step.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.459
Even if the fear of rejection makes you hesitate,

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:57.420
if you pray for courage as Philippians 2.13 tells us to do,

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.900
Jehovah will give you both the desire and the power to act,

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.859
and will bless your efforts.

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:08.780
So even if you feel hesitant to speak up, don't give up.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.990
Pause, pray, and turn your thoughts into actions.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.509
Actually, the Bible tells us about the solution.

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:25.340
Here, let me show you.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.139
Under God's Kingdom, peaceful abound.

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:32.860
God's Kingdom.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.939
Sounds like a possible solution.

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:39.300
But now, I've got a lot of questions.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.780
Right.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.780
I had a lot of questions, too.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.939
But I found the answers by studying the Bible.

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:49.500
It's the best way, really.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.020
Studying the Bible?

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.379
Yes.

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.419
Some people might think a Bible study involves attending classes

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:59.539
with many others or taking exams.

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:02.580
How can we avoid this misunderstanding?

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.740
This is the second step.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.460
Demonstrate how a Bible study is conducted.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.659
Showing them this video from the Teaching Toolbox in JW Library,

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:17.659
not only answers frequently asked questions about Bible studies,

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:22.539
but is also one of the best ways to help them want to study the Bible.

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:24.780
You also studied the Bible like this?

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:25.500
Yes.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.939
I really enjoyed studying the Bible.

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:32.180
Video said the future becomes brighter if you study the Bible.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.659
So how does it become brighter?

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.680
Like this.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.199
Enjoy life forever.

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:45.360
You can watch the video together and then show them the back cover

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.639
of the enjoy life forever brochure.

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:52.919
If they respond positively, you can build their anticipation

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.800
by moving on to the third step.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.280
This involves finding out what they are interested in.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.759
To do this, show them page 15 of the brochure

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:06.240
and ask them to choose a topic that interests them.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.319
This one.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.560
How to find real peace?

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.319
Yes, peace is really important.

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.920
Then how about we explore this topic together for our first Bible study?

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.000
Sounds good.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.319
What time works for you?

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:23.480
The brother did an excellent job of starting a Bible study.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.399
So let us review.

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:28.120
To offer a Bible study, there are three steps.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.120
The first is prayer.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.240
You might feel hesitant about offering a Bible study,

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.199
but Jehovah can give you both the desire and the power to do so.

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:43.240
The second is to demonstrate how a Bible study is conducted.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.480
We have effective tools that help us to do this.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.480
For example, you can use the what happens at a Bible study video

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.360
and the enjoy life forever brochure.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.720
The third is to find out the other person's interests.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.720
Use page 15 of the brochure to find out which topics interest them.

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:09.399
But remember, the more important than any method or technique

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:15.800
is showing genuine love for God and people, just as Jesus did.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:22.040
This will no doubt help you to achieve your goal of making disciples.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.279
After what we've explored together today,

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:29.120
I feel motivated to go out and start a Bible study.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.079
I hope you also feel the same way.
