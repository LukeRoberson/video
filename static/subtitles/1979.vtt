00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:14.949
And in production to second Peter, the Apostle Peter identifies himself as the writer of his two inspired letters, first and second Peter.

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:22.949
Peter wrote his second letter about 64 CE shortly after he wrote his first letter.

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.949
At the time, he may still have been in Babylon or its vicinity.

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:39.950
Peter's second letter encourages anointed Christians to make their heavenly calling sure, to guard against false teachers, and to pay attention to the prophetic word.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.950
Second Peter contains three chapters.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:54.950
Chapter 1 discusses Christ's Transfiguration, which gave Peter, James and John a preview of Christ's glory and kingdom power.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:05.950
The Transfiguration made the prophetic word more sure, so Christ's followers should pay attention to it as to a lamp shining in a dark place.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:14.950
In Chapter 2 Peter warns us that false teachers would arise and bring in destructive sects.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:24.950
Those deceivers, who began to appear in the first century, would face divine judgment as did the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.950
Did you know?

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.950
When Peter wrote his second letter, he knew that his death was near.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:41.950
But instead of being overly concerned about himself, he continued to obey Jesus' loving command, feed my little sheep.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.950
Chapter 3 points forward to Christ's presence and kingdom power.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:02:00.950
Concerning that time, Peter foretold that there would be ridiculers, who would deliberately ignore that Jehovah had destroyed a wicked world once before, in Noah's day.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:08.949
Peter then points to God's promise of a figurative new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness will dwell.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:18.199
In the meantime, God's people should stick to the holy writings and engage in deeds of godly devotion.

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:26.199
As you read Second Peter, note how Christ's transfiguration can strengthen our faith and Bible prophecy,

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:35.199
how we need to be on guard against false teachers, and how we must patiently await the new heavens, God's kingdom government,

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:40.199
which will rule over a new earthly society of God-fearing humans.
