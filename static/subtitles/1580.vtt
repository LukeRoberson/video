00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.690
David was sick.

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:10.660
Absalom saw this as an opportunity to seize power.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.500
Like his father, David, he had many gifts.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.920
He was born into a wealthy and powerful family.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.160
He turned heads wherever he went, and he relished the attention.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:39.929
Men would come to the city gate, so the king would hear their legal case.

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:41.810
If I was appointed judge in the land,

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.009
every man with a legal case or judgment could come to me,

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:49.210
and I would see he receives justice.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:56.770
You are from the royal house, my mother too has royal blood.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:07.599
It seems I was born to lead, but God will do what's best for his people.

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:12.000
Absalom seemed to be interested in the people who came to David,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.200
but he was only interested in himself.
