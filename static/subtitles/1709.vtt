00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.779
My name is Raseo Picado Herrero.

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:13.779
I studied chemistry at the University of Salamanca in Spain.

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:17.780
I specialize in organic chemistry.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.780
This field focuses on the study of the carbon atom

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.780
and all the compounds that are derived from this atom.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.730
I believed that life came about through evolution.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.729
I remember seeing a picture in a natural science book

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.729
that depicted the embryos of different vertebrates.

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:40.729
And in the early stages of development, the similarities were outstanding.

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:43.729
But when I started studying at the University,

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:48.729
I began studying in detail the process on which the evolution theory is based.

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:54.729
To my surprise, I discovered that these processes were not proven facts.

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:59.729
As a chemist, I'm fascinated by the distribution of atoms within a molecule.

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:03.729
It is interesting to note that in most living creatures,

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:06.730
whether human, animal, or plant life,

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:12.730
the basic proteins required for life are made up of a carefully interwoven collection of amino acids.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:18.730
And with the exception of glycine, all these amino acids have two forms called D and L.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.730
These two forms are each a mirror image of the other.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.730
Just as the right hand is a mirror image of the left,

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.730
but that cannot be superimposed.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:36.730
And what is really striking is that all the amino acids that make up these proteins belong only to the L series.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.730
So I asked myself,

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.730
how is it possible for blind chance to make all the amino acids that are essential for life

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.730
belong solely to the L series?

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.730
I reached the conclusion that there had to be a higher power, a creator.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.730
Even though I had a religious upbringing,

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.730
my ideas were not clear as to who God was.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:05.730
I merely viewed him as a supreme being, before whom we would be held accountable.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.729
The Bible is not a science textbook.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.729
Its purpose is not to describe the universe we live in,

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:14.729
or the laws that regulate our universe.

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:16.729
But when it does mention science,

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:18.729
and when it discusses scientific matters,

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:21.729
it does so with great accuracy.

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:26.729
And undoubtedly the greatest benefit is that it allows me to enjoy a personal relationship

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:28.729
with the creator of the universe,

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:32.729
a universe that fascinates me from a scientific perspective.
