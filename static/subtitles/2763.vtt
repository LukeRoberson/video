00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.799
How did I give her the wrong idea?

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.799
How did I let my guard down?

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.799
If I see her again, I'll make sure she gets the right message.

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.799
In the past, I would have witnessed immediately in a situation like that.

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.590
What changed?

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.590
I've always been busy, but maybe I've let my busy life start to crowd out the important things.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.590
Like my Bible reading.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:01.430
That night I did some research and I found Ephesians chapter 5, verse 25.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.430
Husbands, continue loving your wives, just as the Christ also loved the congregation.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.430
I needed more though.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.430
Verse 26 stood out to me.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.430
There it says what Jesus does for the congregation.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.430
Cleansing it with the bath of water by means of the Word.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.430
If I'm going to stay morally and spiritually clean, I need to read God's Word every day.
