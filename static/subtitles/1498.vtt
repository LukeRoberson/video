00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:08.490
Have you, or a loved one, faced a medical emergency or prepared for a serious medical procedure?

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.490
If so, you know how stressful that can be.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.489
Psalm 41 3 promises that Jehovah will sustain us on our sick bed.

00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:20.489
How does he do this?

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:28.489
Not through miraculous cures, but by lovingly providing physical, emotional, and spiritual support.

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:32.490
One means of support is the hospital liaison committee arrangement.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:41.490
Today, more than 16,000 brothers serve on or coordinate some 2,000 liaison committees around the world.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.490
How do they assist?

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:54.490
Our role is to help doctors and Jehovah's Witnesses to come to a consensus on how to treat the patient without breaking God's law.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.490
Once we visited a big hospital with two other brothers.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.490
And when we went in, we had 25 doctors waiting for us.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.489
And more doctors were listening through a conference call.

00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:12.489
When we stepped into the auditorium, one of the doctors said to us,

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:15.489
Now you have entered a lion's den.

00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:19.489
Well, that was not an easy start.

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:26.489
We were able to present our hospital presentation, answer their questions, and provide some medical articles.

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:35.489
These are medical articles that are carefully screened and reviewed by a panel of doctors for accuracy, for credibility.

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:44.489
Those are the articles that are provided to the hospital liaison committee, brother, to show to the doctor, to try and persuade him or her,

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:52.489
that this is a valid and effective treatment strategy to use that can avoid blood transfusion.

00:01:52.489 --> 00:02:01.489
Now doctors understand patients can make their own choices regarding blood, and I have to respect the choices patients make.

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:08.490
And they now understand that they can treat patients now without the use of blood.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:18.490
Our surgeons got incredibly fantastic about doing procedures differently, advanced technology, to do procedures that now didn't require blood transfusion.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.490
We embraced the idea that we should treat respectfully the wishes of the Jova's witness patients.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:33.490
Serious medical situations are stressful, and decisions often need to be made quickly, including those involving blood.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:39.490
The hospital liaison committee arrangement provides comfort and help at the right time.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.490
For the past year, I've been going through an extremely difficult trial.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:51.490
There were some false starts and misdiagnosis, but we finally got diagnosed about a year ago that I had a softened yield cancer.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:03:02.490
I know that Jova, in this present evil system of things, won't stab his finger and say, cancer be gone, I know that.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.490
And I've never asked him for that. We're prayed for that.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:13.490
But what I have prayed for is comfort, not only myself, but for my family.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.490
It's an answer to my prayer. I pray for help, and they show up.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:28.689
He has delivered tenfold what would be expected.

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:34.689
Jova will sustain him on his sick bed. During his sickness, you will completely change his bed.

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:41.689
Sometimes there's a sick patient in bed fighting for their life, and they're surrounded by family and friends.

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:47.689
And the strongest person in the room is the person in the bed, and it's this scripture being fulfilled.

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:54.689
Sometimes they are the one encouraging everyone else. They're the ones telling everyone else, don't cry, it's going to be okay.

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:59.689
Everything's going to be fine, and that's Jova sustaining them on their sick bed.

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:08.689
Receiving the benefits from the HLC, from my times in the hospital, makes me believe something about the HLC is that's very special.

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:19.689
It's all based on love. It's based on love, first and foremost for Jova, and appreciation for what he's given us, the health that we have.

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:29.689
And to be privileged to receive that love, and to give that love, is a privilege that I'll never forget.

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:34.689
Each of us also plays a vital role by doing two important things.

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:42.689
First, by having a current completed simplified durable power of attorney, DPA card.

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:50.689
Second, in advance of any medical procedure, ensure your doctors will support your health care decisions.

00:04:50.689 --> 00:05:01.379
How grateful we are for the hospital liaison committee arrangement, and the thousands of brothers working tirelessly on our behalf.

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:06.379
This is truly evidence of Jova's loving interest and care.
