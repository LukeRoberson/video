00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:10.220
Despite the advice and counsel that the organisation has given, we decided the safe course with

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:18.899
social media was just to forbid everything. This didn't work. It caused some friction.

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:21.140
We didn't show a great deal on the standing.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:31.579
Well, personally for me, racing my children is very difficult because my husband is not

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:39.140
a witness. With my older son, I had a problem when he started dating a girl. When I found

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.259
out, I was very irritated with him because I had told him where and we always talked

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:56.380
and now, suddenly, he sat indifferently.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:04.140
We decided to flee because of the war. That is why we went to the refugee camp. The problem

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.980
we had was that my son started to imitate the bad conduct of the non-witness young ones.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.180
Our neighbours, so he needed a lot of help.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:26.640
We've really benefited from taking the heart, the counsel, the brothers have given to be

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.959
reasonable with our children, trying to understand their point of view, and trying to help them

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:39.680
to draw close to Jehovah. It's no good just trying to say what they should do all the time

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.799
without listening to their needs.

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:50.840
And so we agreed that if we stay within boundaries of Bible principles, that she could use some

00:01:50.840 --> 00:02:00.939
forms of social media and of course the reaction was good.

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:07.340
For me, James won 19, helped me a lot because there, it mentions that we should be quick

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.780
to listen, slow to speak and slow to anger. So I realised that I should have listened

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:20.780
to my son first and calm myself down and not gotten upset like I did.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:29.659
It's good to apologise when we make mistakes as parents because it will help our children

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:36.099
in return to realise the mistakes they are making. We are closer and we feel more comfortable

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:42.539
talking to each other about things.

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:47.099
There were other activities in the camp, but we always found time to have our family

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:54.219
study. We had a few older books and magazines that we had taken when we fled the war and

00:02:54.219 --> 00:03:00.580
we used these older publications during our family study.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.979
Usually what we do, my wife and I, is if there is a problem we discuss it together and

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:14.939
prepare how we can teach our children. The problem we had was that my son started to

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:21.300
imitate the bad conduct of the non-witness young ones, our neighbours, so he needed a

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:28.300
lot of help. But after meditating on this, I realised instead of punishing him, I needed

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.460
to reason with him patiently to explain the dangers.
