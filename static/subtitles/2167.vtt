00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:08.660
God inspired some 40 men to write the Bible, but have you ever wondered what did they write it on?

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:15.660
After all, the oldest portions of the Bible were written more than 1,000 years before the invention of what we know today as paper.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.660
The earliest Bible manuscripts were written on a material called Papyrus.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:29.660
Papyrus is a plant that grows in shallow water with stalks that can reach almost 4.6 meters or about 15 feet high.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:39.659
Over 4,000 years ago, the Egyptians invented ways to turn Papyrus into a smooth, strong writing material similar to paper.

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:44.659
Even with modern tools, you can see it was a lot of work.

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:59.000
Thin slices of the plant's core had to be soaked and flattened, arranged in layers, and then beaten and pressed to bind the layers together.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
When the sheets were dry, they were polished with a piece of ivory, a smooth shell, or even a stone.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The result was a relatively smooth surface for writing.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:20.000
To make a scroll, individual sheets of Papyrus were pasted together along the edges to make a roll that might be more than 6 meters or about 20 feet in length.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:30.920
But around the 2nd century CE, copyists began favoring a new technology that made Papyrus documents much easier to use.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.920
The Codex.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:41.920
With the Codex, the Papyrus pages were folded, sewn, and bound together to form something similar to a modern book.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.920
Think of all the hours required to produce these materials to write on.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.920
But without modern pens and pencils, what did ancient people use to write with?

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.230
The pens they used were often made from pieces of hard read like this.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.659
Carefully cut to produce a pointed slit.

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:14.659
In Bible Times, one common type of ink that would be used with these read pens was made by combining blacksoot with a rubbery gum that helped it stick to the page.

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.659
Then water was added to the mixture.

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:30.370
Whether in the form of a scroll or a Codex, the problem with Papyrus was that it decomposed easily.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:37.370
Amazingly, there are many fragments of Bible manuscripts on Papyrus that have survived down to our day.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.370
What you see here are reproductions of fragments that are more than 2,000 years old.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.370
In time, Bible manuscripts began to be copied onto more durable materials.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.370
By about the 4th century, the most common of those was parchment.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.370
It was normally made from the hides of sheep, calves, or goats.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:10.099
The process begins by soaking the hide and water in lime, then removing the hair and excess flesh.

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:17.099
After that, the skin is stretched on a frame and scraped with a knife to remove any residues like fat.

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:24.099
The next step is to dry the skin under increased tension, which causes it to become stiff and flat.

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:31.099
Finally, it's dusted with chalk and sanded smooth with pumice to create an even writing surface.

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:38.669
As you can see, making even one sheet of parchment requires a tremendous amount of work.

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:45.669
But today, there are many Bible manuscripts that were written on parchment such as these two original manuscripts here.

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:53.669
Another famous manuscript is the Codex Amiatinus located in Italy, which is over 1,300 years old.

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:58.669
In fact, it's the oldest, complete Latin Bible bound in a single volume ever found.

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:05.669
Some historians feel that it required the hides of over 400 animals to produce.

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:09.669
This replica is big, but the original is even larger.

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:13.669
It weighs 34 kilograms or about 75 pounds.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.180
Think of all of the work that went into producing just that one Bible.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.180
Well, all of these materials are perishable and deteriorate with time.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:32.180
But to preserve his word, Jehovah God saw to it that the Bible was meticulously copied and recopied over the centuries.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:38.180
So that today, we have not just a few, but thousands of manuscripts of various parts of the Bible.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.180
So the next time you look up a Bible verse by tapping on a link,

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.180
think about what it took to put those words in writing.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:53.180
And how amazing it is that Jehovah's Word, recorded using these ancient, fragile materials, is still with us today.
