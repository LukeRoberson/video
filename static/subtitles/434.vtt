00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:08.740
Well, brothers, let's open our Bibles, and let's read again our text for today, 1 Corinthians chapter 10

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:18.179
and verse 23. It says all things are lawful, but not all things are advantageous.

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.660
And then you notice it goes on to say, all things are lawful, but not all things build up.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:33.619
Let each one keep seeking not his own advantage, but that of the other person.

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:43.299
Now, what is Paul trying to tell us here? In the 1975 watchtower commenting on these two verses,

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:50.659
this is what the watchtower said. Within the framework of Christian law, there is a wide

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:57.780
latitude of action, and the Christian has to decide many matters according to his Christian

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.700
conscience, but he must also consider the conscience as of others. Not all things build up either

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:15.219
himself or others. When I was a point, there are many, many areas of life where there is not

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:22.980
a specific law that governs our action as Christians. We have to use Bible principles

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.739
and the wonderful gift of the conscience that Jehovah God has given us.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:35.939
But most often, we tend to think of the conscience as something that prevents us from doing what

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:42.980
is wrong. In fact, maybe we tend to think of it as being like the smoke alarm when there's just

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:50.260
that slightest hint of smoke that alarm goes off to protect us, to signal that something is wrong,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:57.780
something needs to be done. Well, it's true. Our well-trained conscience can alert us when we're

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:06.099
about to enter into a course that could cause us danger. But if our conscience is really well-trained,

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:13.219
according to the thinking of our Heavenly Father, Jehovah, it will be able to do even more than that.

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:19.699
Now, what do we have in mind? Well, let's consider an example of King David when he had to flee

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:27.460
from Jerusalem at the time of the revolt of Absalom. Now, let's go to 2 Samuel, chapter 17.

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:38.340
Now, as you're looking this up, 2 Samuel, chapter 17, you'll remember that down here in verse 27,

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.740
three faithful men came to know that David and some of his men were out there in the wilderness.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.979
Now, what did they do? Look at verse 27. As soon as David came to Mahaneam,

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:59.139
show me the son of Nehash from Rabah of the Ammonites, maker the son of Amio from Lodibar,

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:08.979
and Barzilli, the Giliadite from Rogilim, brought beds, basins, clay pots, wheat, barley,

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:16.819
flour, roasted grain, broad beans, lentils, parched grain, honey, butter, sheep, and cheese.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.780
They brought all of this out for David and the people with him to eat.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:31.060
For they said, now, notice this, the people are hungry and tired and thirsty in the wilderness.

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:39.139
Now, what's the point? You see, these men came to know about David and his men being out there

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:46.740
in the wilderness with no supplies. Now, how did that affect them? Well, their conscience began

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:52.740
to work and it showed them they needed to do something to help those men. Now, when you look at

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:59.939
that list of things, it's obvious they didn't just send one or two things, but their conscience moved

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:06.819
them to really do something kind, to do something generous, to do something good, to help them.

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:12.979
Now, consider also helping David was risky. Absalom was more than willing to kill people who

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:20.740
were going to support David. So, it took a risk of even their own safety, but these men,

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:26.259
because of their good conscience, were moved to do the right thing, the good thing, the generous

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:33.220
thing. Now, what do we learn from that? Well, a well-trained conscience will not just simply

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:39.699
prevent us from doing the wrong thing, but it has the power to move us to do what's right,

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:46.500
to do what's kind, what's generous, what's loyal to our brothers and to Jehovah.

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:54.100
When out Jesus also taught this lesson, and let's look at the example that Jesus taught in this

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.459
parable. Now, of course, we always used to call it the parable of the good Samaritan, but now we call

00:04:59.459 --> 00:05:04.579
it the parable of the neighborly Samaritan. I'm still getting used to that myself, but Luke

00:05:04.579 --> 00:05:13.300
chapter 10, and let's just remind ourselves of some of the details about this. So, you remember

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:21.060
first of all, in verse 30, this man was going from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell victim to

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:29.540
robbers, and verse 30 says that they beat him, and they left him half dead on the road. Now, look

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:39.220
at verse 31. It says here that a priest was going by on the road, and he saw this man laying on

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:48.339
the road, half dead, and what did he do? It says he crossed the street. He went to the other side

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:55.699
and passed by, as though that man was not even there. But now look at verse 32,

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:04.180
here comes a Levite, and he sees him also, but what does he do? Just exactly the same thing. He

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:12.819
crosses the road and passes by to avoid having to even look at this man that was in distress. What can

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:19.300
you say about those two men? Their conscience was not working at all, was it? But now what about

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:28.660
the Samaritan? Verse 33 says that when he saw this man, he was moved with pity. And what did he do?

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:35.620
Verse 34 says, he approached him. He bandaged his wounds. He poured oil and wine on them. He put

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:42.579
the man on his own animal. He brought him to an end. He took care of him. He took out money. He

00:06:42.579 --> 00:06:47.779
gave it to the innkeeper. He said, take care of him. Whatever you spend besides this, I'll come back

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:54.740
and I'll give it to you. I'll pay you. Now what do we know about this man who was a Samaritan?

00:06:56.019 --> 00:07:03.939
Obviously, his conscience was working, and it told him what was the right thing to do? What was

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:11.300
the good thing, the generous thing, the hopeful thing to do for this man? Well, what's the point?

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:19.699
This good conscience, if it's well-trained by Bible principles and by the thinking of our God,

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:28.100
Jehovah, will do so much more than just prevent us from entering into a wrong course. It will stimulate

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:36.100
us to do the right thing, the generous thing, the kind thing. Now how can we use this information

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:43.220
in the midst today of this coronavirus pandemic? Well, of course, no doubt all of us right now

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:50.100
are feeling some measure of anxiety and stress. As this goes on week after week, having to be in our

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:56.980
room, sheltering in place, and so on, it's not an easy situation for any of us. In one country

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:04.180
in Europe that's been very hard hit by the pandemic, a sister was in the hospital for cancer

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:09.939
treatment when the lockdown was enforced. Now, her daughter and son-in-law are at Bethel. They're

00:08:09.939 --> 00:08:16.019
very, very close to the hospital, but they were not able to go and visit her because of the situation.

00:08:16.019 --> 00:08:22.339
Now, as the memorial was approaching, this dear sister was so worried that she was going to have to

00:08:22.339 --> 00:08:28.740
celebrate the memorial all by herself in the hospital. But can you imagine how touched she was

00:08:29.699 --> 00:08:35.460
when she found out that a sister who worked in the hospital had very kindly decided to

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:42.580
travel to the hospital when it was not her shift just for the sole purpose of being with our

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:48.740
sister and celebrating the memorial. She dressed up in all the appropriate protective gear and then

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:53.539
enjoyed the memorial with our sister who was alone at the hospital. How beautiful.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:09:01.220
In the same country in Europe, the brothers told about a young brother who works also in a hospital.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:07.379
And of course, because the country has been so hard hit and some of our brothers and sisters

00:09:07.379 --> 00:09:14.500
have died as a result of the pandemic, this dear brother has made a point of going to visit

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:21.220
these various brothers and sisters who are dying to offer them comfort because their own family

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:28.259
members are not able to come to the hospital and be with them at that time. Can you imagine how

00:09:28.259 --> 00:09:33.860
comforting it's been for those family members to know that this young brother has taken the

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:40.980
initiative to be with them, comfort them, show them love in such a difficult time. Well, brothers,

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:48.980
what do we learn from all of this? We are in a time of increased stress, of increased anxiety.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:58.340
We all have the power to help others through acts of kindness and deeds of goodness that show

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:07.220
generosity and love. Let's be motivated by our good conscience to do those good and kind and

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:12.659
generous things that really show that we're imitators of our Heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:10:13.379 --> 00:10:20.500
And as we do, we're going to find that our stress will be relieved. And at the same time,

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:28.580
we'll show that we're eager to do things that are not only lawful, but also that are advantageous.
