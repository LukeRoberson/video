WEBVTT

00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:05.610
Well, brothers, the next item, their agenda,

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.609
is what we've been working on for the past three months.

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:11.609
In Kevin, since this is your first elders meeting with us,

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:13.609
maybe we can fill in on the background.

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:15.609
Thanks, that'll be great.

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:18.609
We noted that some in the congregation were anxious

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:20.609
because of unstable world conditions.

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.609
And we decided to focus on strengthening the friends

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.609
when shepherding so that they'd be able to face future events

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.609
with courage.

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.609
Yeah, we also wanted to command them

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.609
where they're already shown courage.

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.609
To help them to see that the courage they developed now

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:38.609
will help them to display courage in the future.

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:41.609
Luther, how do things go in your group?

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:43.609
Maybe you can share an experience

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:46.609
that gives an idea of the overall results.

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:47.609
Sure.

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:52.609
I think the experience that best illustrates it is Marco Bryan's.

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:55.609
He was facing some serious pressure at work

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:57.609
to compromise his neutrality.

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:02.109
Look, Mark, I understand you don't like to get involved

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:03.109
in politics.

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:04.109
I don't either.

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:07.109
But if we don't protest this new bill,

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:11.109
our company is going to get hit with cutbacks and layoffs.

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:14.109
Joel, don't get me wrong.

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:16.109
I'm concerned too.

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:18.109
But I won't join the protest.

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:19.109
Okay.

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:22.109
So you won't stand in line in protest.

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:26.109
But at least sign the sheet to show you support the protest.

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:30.109
It's like you're voting or joining a political party.

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:32.109
Your name won't even be noticed.

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:35.109
We just need signatures.

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:38.109
So far, everyone in the company has had it.

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:42.109
Mark, I'm going to be straight with you.

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:47.109
The boss told me he's going to have to let some people go.

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:52.109
And your name is under serious consideration.

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:57.739
Depending on the outcome of this discussion,

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:00.739
just sign the paper, Mark.

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:11.669
Did he sign the paper?

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:15.530
No.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.530
And you know why?

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.530
At that moment, he said a silent prayer

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.530
that gave him the courage needed to remain neutral.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.259
I commended him, and I reminded him that displaying courage now

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:32.259
is going to help him in the future.

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:33.259
Thanks, Luther.

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:35.259
That's very encouraging to hear.

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:39.259
Matthew, how do things go with you?

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:45.550
Matthew, how do things go with you?

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.550
Very good.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.550
In fact, Sally's experience is one that stands out for me.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:03:06.729
Hey, would you like to make a donation to the marathon?

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:09.729
No, thank you.

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:43.389
Shall I put it in the bag or do you want to wear it now?

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:44.389
No, thank you.

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:49.909
It's wrong, honey.

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:55.539
You got something against them?

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:59.539
Well, no, I don't have anything against him personally.

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:01.539
So what's the problem?

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:06.840
I respect that they have a right to choose their lifestyle,

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.840
but as a bottle reader, I choose...

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.840
Excuse me.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.840
I'm a bottle reader, too.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.839
I go to church, and our church is one of the biggest supporters for this marathon.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:19.839
So what are you trying to say?

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:34.139
Displaying courage now will help me display courage in the future.

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.139
Well, I'm one of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:42.829
and we believe the Bible teaches sexist for a man and a woman who are married.

00:04:42.829 --> 00:04:43.829
In tolerant people.

00:04:43.829 --> 00:05:00.589
That's your tough courage.

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:02.589
That's what I told her.

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:07.589
And I asked her to think about when the political powers destroy false religion.

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:11.589
At that time, people won't want to admit that they're religious.

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:16.589
And so for us, to admit that we're Jehovah's Witnesses then,

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:20.589
well, that's going to require the same type of courage as she displayed in that market.

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:22.589
Wow.

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:28.589
I remember when Sally was just a little girl handing out tracks.

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:32.589
And now, look how well she's done.

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:35.589
Speaking of tracks, may I share an experience with you, brother?

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:36.589
Sure.

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:43.269
Do you recall a little over 10 years ago,

00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:48.269
we had the Kingdom News campaign, the end of false religion is near.

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:52.269
During our shepherding visit with Sherry Spencer,

00:05:52.269 --> 00:06:02.449
she admitted that something happened to her during that campaign.

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:07.449
As a public service, I'm sharing in an earthquake distribution of this important message

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:09.449
that's your free copy.

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:12.689
Hey!

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:14.689
What's this about?

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:19.689
Are you trying to tell me that my religion is false and yours is true?

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:22.689
Get off my property!

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:26.689
You come back again, I'm going to set my dog on you!

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:29.689
Nobody wants to hear!

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:45.019
Sister Spencer said that experience stayed with her.

00:06:45.019 --> 00:06:50.019
To this day, she finds it very difficult to be in the ministry.

00:06:55.589 --> 00:07:01.589
Brothers, I feel like, after all these years,

00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:06.589
if I can't get over this fear, I may not make it when times get harder.

00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:18.860
Sister Spencer, you may be surprised to know that most of us get nervous when talking at the doors.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.860
I know that I do.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.860
You're just trying to make me feel better.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:29.259
No, I'm saying it because it's true.

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:33.259
Being courageous doesn't mean we won't get nervous.

00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:37.259
Sometimes being courageous means taking action even though we are nervous.

00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:41.540
Thanks, that is encouraging.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.540
Here's a suggestion that may help.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:48.540
We've discussed Psalm 27 and verse 14.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:55.540
Based on that scripture, the next time you're about to face a situation that calls for courage,

00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:02.540
whether it be in the ministry or otherwise, tell yourself you just need to do these three things.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:09.920
Pray, open Jehovah and act.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.920
You got it?

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:17.920
Pray, open Jehovah and act.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:26.100
Wait till I'm going to write that down.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:30.100
Helping the friends address their fears, it's really going to help

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:35.100
when our message changes from good news to judgment.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:42.230
So Peter, let's hear from you next.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:46.230
So Peter, let's hear from you next.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:54.230
When we informed everyone that the publishers were going to be redistributed to the north or south congregation,

00:08:54.230 --> 00:09:06.580
let's just say some struggle with the idea.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.580
Paula, did you see?

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:14.580
I have us going to the south congregation and everybody else from our group is going to north.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.580
Yeah, I saw that.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.580
My aunt and cousins will be going there, too.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:25.620
Well, that doesn't make any sense. They should keep you together.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:30.620
Well, at least the brothers said that the list was just a recommendation.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.620
Well, they didn't say it exactly like that.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.620
They said if we had extenuating circumstances.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:40.620
So you don't have to go if you don't want to go.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.620
If everyone did that, don't you think?

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:44.620
Hi, sister Taylor.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.620
Oh, hello, girls.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:53.620
I saw your name on the list for the south congregation, but your grandkids and their families, they're going to north.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.620
So what are you going to do?

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:59.960
What do you mean?

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.960
Well, are you going to north or are you going to south?

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.960
Now, sweetie, didn't you say you saw my name listed under the south congregation?

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:14.559
Yeah, but so I'll be going to the south congregation.

00:10:14.559 --> 00:10:23.000
Well, don't you think it would make more sense if you were in the same congregation as your grandkids and their families?

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Does it make more sense?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Well, that's a whole different question.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
The brothers outlined an arrangement.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:40.000
They said they hope we could support that arrangement unless we had extenuating circumstances and I don't have any right now.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
So for me, it's simple.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.759
Whether I do all of the reasons or not, I'm going to support that arrangement.

00:10:49.759 --> 00:10:51.759
Oh, look, girls, I've got to go.

00:10:51.759 --> 00:11:03.190
Oh, and by the way, I hope to see you both in the south congregation.

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:09.190
I think this experience well illustrates one way to show courage now.

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:12.190
And that's by following the direction of the brothers taking the lead.

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:18.190
Even if we don't fully understand the reasons why this direction has been given.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:20.190
Exactly.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:25.190
We've been told when God of May, God, attacks Jehovah's people,

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:30.190
we may receive direction that may not seem practical.

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:36.190
So courageously following directions now will help us to do so then.

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:39.190
So brothers, we're almost done.

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:48.070
And if you don't mind, I'd like to share what happened with my group.

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:53.070
The Monroe's asked if I would join them on one of their family worship evenings.

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:56.070
So let's ask our final review question.

00:11:56.070 --> 00:12:01.070
How can we prepare ourselves for the events that are to come?

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:03.070
Sarah?

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:08.070
We want to develop heartfelt obedience to the guidance that we receive now.

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:14.070
So that will obey any future instructions Jehovah may give us.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:18.070
So doing this will help us survive Armageddon.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:20.070
Well said.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:23.830
Very nice to hear.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.830
May I ask Brad a question?

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:26.830
Sure.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:27.830
Go ahead.

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:32.830
Brad, I noticed you've really been focused on that picture.

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:37.909
You might have asked what you're thinking about.

00:12:37.909 --> 00:12:42.909
Well, will the brothers tell us how to fight the people who will be attacking us?

00:12:42.909 --> 00:12:44.909
We won't need to do any fighting.

00:12:44.909 --> 00:12:47.909
Now what will we need the instructions for?

00:12:47.909 --> 00:12:50.909
Are we just going to stand there and do nothing?

00:12:50.909 --> 00:12:54.909
We don't know what those instructions will be, son.

00:12:54.909 --> 00:13:00.909
Brad, when Armageddon comes, we'll have nothing to worry about.

00:13:00.909 --> 00:13:02.909
And we won't have to fight.

00:13:03.909 --> 00:13:08.909
We know that because of what Jehovah has done for us people in the past.

00:13:08.909 --> 00:13:16.909
I'd like to show you an account in 2 Chronicles chapter 20.

00:13:16.909 --> 00:13:23.909
It was a time when Moelbites and Ammonites started the war against the land of Judah,

00:13:23.909 --> 00:13:26.909
who's been ruled by King Jehoshaphat.

00:13:26.909 --> 00:13:34.179
Some of those Israelites were likely anxious, just like you.

00:13:34.179 --> 00:13:39.179
Jehoshaphat gathered Judah at the temple and began to inquire of Jehovah.

00:13:39.179 --> 00:13:48.259
And Jehovah caused the Levite named Jezile to give an answer that gave everyone courage.

00:13:48.259 --> 00:13:52.309
What did he say?

00:13:52.309 --> 00:13:58.309
Do not be afraid or be terrified because of this large crowd.

00:13:58.309 --> 00:14:03.309
For the battle's not yours, but God's.

00:14:03.309 --> 00:14:06.309
You will not need to fight this battle.

00:14:06.309 --> 00:14:13.309
Take your position, stand still, and see the salvation of Jehovah in your behalf.

00:14:13.309 --> 00:14:27.679
Jehovah turned the enemies against each other.

00:14:27.679 --> 00:14:32.679
By the time the Israelites arrived, not one soldier was left.

00:14:32.679 --> 00:14:42.519
It was obvious that Brad's courage was strengthened after reviewing this Bible account.

00:14:42.519 --> 00:14:46.519
And I'm happy to say that after our discussions, the friends in our group

00:14:46.519 --> 00:14:52.519
are more aware of how their own acts of courage now will help them be courageous in the future.

00:14:52.519 --> 00:15:00.379
Enough from me, it's your turn, Albert.

00:15:00.379 --> 00:15:02.379
Enough from me, it's your turn, Albert.

00:15:02.379 --> 00:15:04.379
How do things go with your group?

00:15:04.379 --> 00:15:07.379
All responded nicely.

00:15:07.379 --> 00:15:11.379
But there was one discussion about courage that I didn't anticipate.

00:15:11.379 --> 00:15:16.379
Remember when Philip got accepted to work with LDC as a construction volunteer?

00:15:16.379 --> 00:15:17.379
Yeah.

00:15:17.379 --> 00:15:25.250
Well, getting accepted to LDC wasn't quite what he expected.

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:27.250
Wow, Philip, this is great.

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:30.250
Yeah, that's what everybody keeps saying.

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:32.250
It's just overwhelming.

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:37.250
I thought I was more cut out for a brothel, but construction volunteer?

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:40.250
I don't even know what that is.

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:42.250
Who knows where they'll send me?

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:46.250
And what if I get asked to do stuff I've never done before?

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:49.250
Well, Philip, your concerns are understandable.

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:52.250
I just don't think I can handle all of this.

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:56.740
I don't think you can, either.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:04.299
Well, I'm glad someone finally agrees with me.

00:16:04.299 --> 00:16:08.299
I say I don't think you can handle this assignment because...

00:16:08.299 --> 00:16:11.299
It requires more than you to get it done.

00:16:11.299 --> 00:16:13.299
I know what you're saying.

00:16:13.299 --> 00:16:16.299
Of course, Jehovah will help me.

00:16:16.299 --> 00:16:18.299
But do you really believe that?

00:16:18.299 --> 00:16:22.500
I do, but...

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.500
But what?

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:32.120
I guess what I'm saying is I'm afraid.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.120
That's okay.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:40.120
When I first arrived in this congregation as my SKE assignment, I was afraid.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:45.120
But you know, one verse that really helped me is First Chronicles 28, verse 20.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:50.120
These are David's words to a son Solomon, whom Jehovah signed to build the temple.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:54.820
Then David said to his son Solomon,

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:57.820
be courageous and strong and go to work.

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.820
Do not be afraid or be terrified.

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.820
For Jehovah God, my God, is with you.

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:06.819
He will not desert you or ban you.

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:14.579
But he will be with you until all the work for the service of Jehovah's House is finished.

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:19.579
This verse reminded me not to overthink all that needs to be done.

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:21.579
Just get started.

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:24.579
With Jehovah's help, you can be courageous.

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:52.369
Go to work.

00:17:52.369 --> 00:17:54.369
There's Philip. Happy is can be.

00:17:54.369 --> 00:17:56.369
He's really doing well.

00:17:56.369 --> 00:18:00.480
Thanks, Albert, for sharing that with us.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:11.029
While brothers, it's clear that Jehovah's less the hard work of the body of elders.

00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:20.259
Now, there's something I wanted to say before we conclude our meeting.

00:18:20.259 --> 00:18:24.960
And that's...

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:31.980
We know David.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.980
We know we're feeling it too.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.980
Yeah.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:40.390
But I just have to say it.

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:46.539
I've really appreciated serving with you, brothers.

00:18:46.539 --> 00:18:51.539
When I saw that our congregation was going to be merged, it wasn't easy for me.

00:18:51.539 --> 00:18:59.140
We sure couldn't tell.

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:01.650
I'm glad.

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:03.650
But it really hit me hard.

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:08.650
The night we posted the list, recommending where the publishers should go.

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:20.470
It seems like it would have made more sense for me to be assigned to the North congregation,

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:23.470
where the majority of my friends would be going.

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:28.470
I've known those friends longer than any of the other brothers.

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:35.470
And now, they're sending that younger elder over to North to be the coordinator of their body of elders.

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:37.470
I just don't get it.

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:47.059
Why am I having such a hard time with this?

00:19:47.059 --> 00:19:51.059
Of course, I'm going to go to the South congregation.

00:19:51.059 --> 00:19:55.079
There's no reason not to.

00:19:55.079 --> 00:19:59.349
The problem is my attitude.

00:19:59.349 --> 00:20:05.349
I've told others for years that there are times when we have to put aside our personal preferences

00:20:05.349 --> 00:20:10.349
to show our wholehearted support of Jehovah's sovereignty.

00:20:10.349 --> 00:20:13.349
This is one of those times.

00:20:13.349 --> 00:20:19.349
I need to be courageous and stand up to selfishness and independent thinking,

00:20:19.349 --> 00:20:22.349
even if it's my own.

00:20:22.349 --> 00:20:28.009
I was reminded.

00:20:28.009 --> 00:20:30.009
It's simple.

00:20:30.009 --> 00:20:36.009
When Jehovah's organization outlines an arrangement, we support it.

00:20:36.009 --> 00:20:39.009
Not just because we're supposed to.

00:20:39.009 --> 00:20:42.009
We do it with the right attitude.

00:20:42.009 --> 00:20:44.009
Amen to that.

00:20:44.009 --> 00:20:47.009
That's a lesson we're all learning.

00:20:47.009 --> 00:20:52.009
But I'm glad we're able to shepherd the congregation before the changes take place.

00:20:52.009 --> 00:20:59.900
Our brothers and sisters are better equipped to face the challenges ahead with courage.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:04.900
It's being a real pleasure to serve with you all.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:08.900
Peter, would you please conclude our meeting with prayer?

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:09.900
Sure.
