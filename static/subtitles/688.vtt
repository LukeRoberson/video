00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:07.519
Congo is certainly not among the most popular travel destinations for tourists around the world,

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.519
but it is definitely a preaching paradise.

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:19.519
In general, very few people have reservations to discuss the personal spiritual convictions with strangers.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:24.519
In addition, Jehovah's Witnesses are well known for their high moral standards

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:28.519
and their consistent Bible education.

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:35.520
It is not uncommon for non-witness parents to even solicit the services of a witness Bible teacher

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.520
in order to help their children become better persons and improve their performance in school.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:49.520
As a result, the number of Bible studies is about three times the number of active witnesses,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.520
and memorial attendance figures amount to almost five times the number of publishers.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.520
As you can imagine, in a country where internet connections are pretty unstable in urban areas

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.519
and almost unavailable in more remote places,

00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:15.519
it was a tremendous challenge for the friends to adapt to the alternative COVID-19 meeting and preaching methods.

00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:21.519
Our branch benefited from many additional arrangements that have been kindly put in place

00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:26.519
to assist these brothers and sisters to keep up to date with spiritual food

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:32.519
and stay active in the ministry, such as the JW Satellite TV Channel,

00:01:32.519 --> 00:01:42.519
the JW Box Network, and pre-recorded public talks broadcast on local radio stations.

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:49.519
In addition, publishers came up with some very practical alternative preaching methods themselves.

00:01:49.519 --> 00:01:56.519
For example, in a rural congregation called Pesci, deep in the interior,

00:01:56.519 --> 00:02:04.519
the news of a worldwide pandemic costing hundreds of thousands of lives hasn't been perceived as more than a background noise.

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:14.520
Still, a temporary special pioneer called Emmanuel was determined to apply theocratic COVID-19 instructions.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:21.520
But how could he continue to conduct his Bible studies in a place with no internet coverage and with students

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.520
who don't even possess smartphones?

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.520
This is what he came up with.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:36.520
As his house has a main entrance and a back door, he advised his Bible students to come one by one,

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.520
enter through the back door, which he left open,

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.520
each one with his own chair, not touching anything in the room,

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.520
and sit down next to the closed door leading to the living room.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.520
Emmanuel himself used the main door, said on the other side of that closed door in the living room

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.150
and conducted his studies, so to speak, behind the closed door.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.150
So let's go back to the urban areas.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:15.150
Here, government-imposed COVID-19 restrictions had a great impact on thousands of our self-employed brothers and sisters

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:22.150
who overnight were cut off their already meager sources of income.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:31.150
Our branch was authorized to provide about 3,000 tons of staple food for more than 200,000 beneficiaries.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:41.150
113 disaster relief committees distributed this humanitarian aid in only four months.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.150
As food trucks pulled up at Kingdom Hall properties,

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:54.150
and later hundreds of individuals left with care packages, many onlookers were deeply impressed.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:02.150
Once more, they realized how different Jehovah's Organization is from all the other religious entities around them.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:11.150
While many pastors and preachers urged their church members to help them financially during the pandemic,

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:17.149
the witnesses distributed three goods to needy ones in their community.

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:24.149
Definitely, the fields in Congo are white for harvesting, and the repress rejoice.
