00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:02.940
Hi.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:20.809
Jogi, how are you?

00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:21.809
Good.

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:22.809
Hello.

00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:23.809
How are you?

00:00:23.809 --> 00:00:24.809
Hi.

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:29.809
We're bringing dinner to brother O's family tonight, and I needed a few more things.

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:31.809
It's been so hard for them, you know.

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:33.810
They don't know how long she'll be in the hospital.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.810
Mom, mom, mom, can I get this one?

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:36.810
No.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:37.810
Please put it back.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:38.810
I want it.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:39.810
Please, mom.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:40.810
Okay.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:41.810
But only if you're good.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:49.179
Okay.

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:50.179
I want to go now.

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:52.179
Mom, can we go?

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:53.179
Mom, mom.

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:55.179
Mom, I want to go, please.

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:56.179
I'll let you go.

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:57.179
We'll talk later.

00:00:57.179 --> 00:00:58.179
I'm sorry.

00:00:58.179 --> 00:00:59.179
I want to go, mom.

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:00.179
Please.

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:04.420
Mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.420
Can I get this, mom?

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.420
I'm sorry.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.420
One minute.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.420
Now, honey, did we already get a snack for later?

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.420
And do you remember what we came to get at the store?

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.420
Yes.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.420
Okay.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.420
So please put that bag.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.420
When I'm done talking to sister, Jui, we can go.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.420
Okay.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:53.620
Jehovah that we can play against soon.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.620
He will make the paradise so we can have fun every day and every basic.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:12.250
There will be animals and lots of cats.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.039
Jehovah, hey.

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:18.039
We're leaving for the meeting soon.

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:19.039
Come on, let's get ready.

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:20.039
We've got ten minutes.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:25.689
I don't want to go.

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.689
And I'm sorry.

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.689
What was that?

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.689
I don't want to go.

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:34.689
What does Jehovah want you to do?

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:35.689
I don't know.

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.689
Does he want it to be so boring?

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.689
Maybe you should pay attention more.

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:42.689
And it won't be so boring.

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:43.689
Okay?

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:45.689
Let's go.

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:52.020
Jehovah, you're in my house.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.020
So you do what we all do.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.020
Right?

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.020
Tonight, we're going to the meeting.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.020
Now, come on.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:06.259
Jehovah, hey.

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:08.259
We're leaving for the meeting soon.

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:09.259
We've got ten minutes.

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:10.259
Come on, let's get ready.

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:12.259
I don't want to go.

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:25.780
Jehovah, did you say that you don't want to go?

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.780
Can you tell me why?

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.780
It's boring.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.120
Ah, well, it is a lot of sitting.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.120
But you didn't always feel this way, did you?

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.120
No, so what changed?

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.120
Dear friends, think it's boring?

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.560
What friends?

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.560
Oh, I see.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.560
Would you hope I want to hear more about this tonight

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.560
when we get home?

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.560
Assess Jehovah for help.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.560
And then, let's get ready.
