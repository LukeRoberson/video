00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:06.099
Well, the quality we're talking about this morning is modesty.

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:15.019
And one of the most powerful reasons for displaying modesty is that it benefits others.

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:16.460
Why can we say that?

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.500
That one of the most powerful reasons for displaying modesty is that it benefits others.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:30.109
It's because of Jesus' words here in the book of Matthew, chapter 22, and let's read together

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:31.109
verse 39.

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:40.890
Matthew 22, of course, in verse 37, Jesus helps us to see that the greatest commandment

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.689
of the law is to love Jehovah.

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:47.490
And without a doubt, a modest course pleases Jehovah.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.530
But in verse 39, the second greatest commandment is this.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.929
You must love your neighbor as yourself.

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:01.250
Well this too becomes a very powerful reason to cultivate and display this, this quality

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.530
of modesty.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:10.049
And interestingly, we see this aspect that is modesty's effect on others in the original

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.090
language of the text.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.849
And the watchtower said this, first of all, at defined modesty it said, in the Bible,

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:25.129
modesty refers to having a proper estimate of ourselves and an awareness of our limitations.

00:01:25.129 --> 00:01:30.489
But then it went on to say, in the original language of the text, the emphasis seems

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:38.890
to be on how that awareness should affect our behavior toward others.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.049
So then with that in mind, let's look at three examples that highlight how modesty

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.650
benefits others.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.969
And all three of our examples focus on giving advice to others, which is what our text

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:52.969
comments also talk about.

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:56.650
For each example, we'll examine the situation.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.969
We'll decide what the modest course is in that situation.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.370
But then how does that modest course benefit others?

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.490
So the first situation, very simply, a friend comes to us for advice.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.969
They're facing some challenge, some trial, or they're facing a complicated decision

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:20.210
that they have to make, and they just want some input, some advice, and so they come

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:21.210
to us.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.250
Well, what is the modest course in this situation?

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.969
Well, it's our text for today, isn't it?

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:32.770
Most Corinthians 4.6 do not go beyond the things that are written.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.610
The study note on that scripture says this.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.530
This rule implies that God's servants are not to teach anything that goes beyond the

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.650
laws and principles expressed in God's inspired word end quote.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.930
So then the modest course is to give our friend advice that is based on Bible principles.

00:02:53.969 --> 00:03:00.729
In other words, we defer to Jehovah in matters of counsel and guidance.

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:06.180
Well, how does that modest course benefit our friend?

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.139
Well, first of all, it benefits them because honestly, our opinion could be wrong, isn't

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:13.500
that true?

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:21.099
Whereas God's word is perfect, and Jehovah's counsel is always beneficial.

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.620
But modesty also helps them because it helps us to be a good listener.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.900
We will modestly recognize that we need to know the facts.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.180
We need to understand the situation in its entirety as much as possible before we can

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.819
identify which Bible principles our friend may wish to consider before they make their

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.219
decision.

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:48.780
So then in the end, modesty helps us because our counsel will be Bible-based and it will

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.759
more closely hit the target of what they need.

00:03:54.759 --> 00:04:01.360
Situation number two, how do things change depending on the subject matter of the advice

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.199
being sought?

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:10.199
So in this scenario, our friend is confiding in us a health problem that they're facing.

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:14.319
And it's maybe a medical treatment that they are trying to decide on and they're looking

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.960
for some input.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.699
What's the modest course in this situation?

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:27.459
Well we genuinely feel for our friend and we want to help them in any way that we can.

00:04:27.459 --> 00:04:32.980
But here too, the principle, the underlying principle of 1 Corinthians 4, 6, applies,

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.660
that is not going beyond the limits of our authority.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.620
Well, what is our authority in this kind of a situation regarding health matters?

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:50.060
The watchtower said, when faced with a health problem, each adult Christian must carry

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:56.180
his own load of responsibility in choosing treatment.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.100
Well then, keeping that in mind, modesty will help us to think carefully before we offer

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:08.300
our own medical advice or before we discourage them from taking a prescribed treatment.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.300
But what can we do to help them?

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.500
Well certainly we can listen empathetically.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.899
We can offer them our sincere heartfelt sympathy and comfort.

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:24.019
We can think about what practical help we can give them and we can reassure them of

00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:28.579
our support for whatever decision they should choose to make.

00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:32.579
And how does that modest course benefit them?

00:05:32.579 --> 00:05:39.300
Well it dignifies them in that it allows them the right to make the decision for themselves.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.300
It also protects them from any undesirable consequences in the event that our medical

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.939
advice might not be the right one in their case.

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:53.899
But it also provides them the love and the reassurance and the support that they need

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:58.709
at that challenging time.

00:05:58.709 --> 00:06:05.350
Situation number three, how do things change depending on who needs the assistance?

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.589
So in this scenario and elder, maybe a work overseer becomes aware that a married sister

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:17.230
on his crew or in his department is in facing some challenge and maybe is in need of assistance.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:22.120
What is the modest course in this situation?

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.839
As we mentioned earlier, modesty includes being aware of our limitations, including being

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:30.000
aware of the limitations of our authority.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
So what is our authority here?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.480
It's interesting that recently the Washtar has helped us to see that there's a difference

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:43.199
between the authority Jehovah gives elders and that which he gives husbands.

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:45.920
Compare with me, please, these two scriptures.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:54.319
The first one is in 1 Peter 5 in verse two.

00:06:54.319 --> 00:07:00.839
So speaking about the authority that Jehovah gives to shepherds, to elders, 1 Peter 5

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:08.519
2 says, shepherd the flock of God under your care, serving as overseers.

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:16.189
With that in mind, as we turn to Ephesians chapter 5, and let's see what authority Jehovah

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:28.930
gives to husbands in verse 23, Ephesians 5 23 says because a husband is head of his wife,

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:35.329
just as the Christ is head of the congregation, he being a savior of this body.

00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:40.250
So comparing these two, we can see Jehovah for elders, they are shepherds, whereas the

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.970
husband is the head of his wife.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.410
Well how does this apply then?

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.209
How does this help our elder in our scenario?

00:07:48.209 --> 00:07:54.649
Well, his knowing the difference between the authority given here helps him to not overstep

00:07:54.649 --> 00:07:58.730
his authority as an overseer and as an elder.

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:03.930
Of course, each situation is different, but depending on the situation, if this truly

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:09.689
is a personal matter, he may very well modestly refrain from giving advice at all.

00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:15.129
He may not get involved at all, he may recognize this feels like husband territory and I'm

00:08:15.129 --> 00:08:19.889
going to allow her to work with her husband in this matter.

00:08:19.889 --> 00:08:24.089
And how does that benefit the couple?

00:08:24.089 --> 00:08:28.009
Well it preserves her husband's authority, doesn't it?

00:08:28.009 --> 00:08:32.090
It also deepens her respect for her husband as he is the one that can help to care for

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:34.769
and help her in this situation.

00:08:34.769 --> 00:08:41.129
It keeps the strength of their marriage intact and their view of the sanctity of marriage.

00:08:41.129 --> 00:08:47.769
And it also avoids even an inkling of an emotional attachment forming between two people who

00:08:47.769 --> 00:08:51.750
are not married.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:58.190
Well these are just a few examples that highlight how our displaying modesty benefits others.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:04.750
And that is one of the most powerful motivations and reasons for displaying modesty.

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:10.990
And sometimes considering how modesty benefits others gives us clarity of mind on what the

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:17.470
modus course is and gives us the motivation to take that course.

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:21.710
And as we considered, this is not just an alternate way of looking at it.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:27.070
This is not just a novel approach to showing modesty, but rather it is based on the second

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:32.789
greatest commandment of the law, that is to love our neighbor as ourselves.

00:09:34.629 --> 00:09:40.549
Well, dear friends, we thank you for your sincere efforts to show modesty and the good

00:09:40.549 --> 00:09:43.429
example that you set in this regard.

00:09:43.429 --> 00:09:48.230
May Jehovah continue to bless your efforts to cultivate this important quality

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:52.789
and thereby help you to be a true gift to your brothers and sisters.
