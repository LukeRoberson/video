00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:07.440
There's a railroad sign that most of us have seen when we before we cross a railroad track. It says

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.240
stop

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.240
look and

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.240
listen and some will say and live

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.399
Now why is this sign there?

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.039
Because we know that crossing a railroad track can endanger our lives

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.559
But the danger is not so evident. It's not immediately seen

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.219
It must be deduced must use your thinking abilities and that's why one sign says

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:40.619
See tracks think train

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:44.939
So we first must stop and

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:52.340
Then look both ways and then even engage the sense of hearing to listen

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.219
Do we hear a rumble of vibration in the earth?

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.700
Do we see a

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.340
Headlight coming our way a whistle blowing

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.060
You see all these indicate a danger

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.900
That the train is not in front of us immediately

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.980
but

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.579
We have to be aware of the danger because as this picture shows a fast moving train

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:20.739
Just cannot stop immediately if we happen to be in the middle of the railroad tracks

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.900
If we were there, we definitely would be killed

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.900
To avoid such a tragedy

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:32.700
We therefore must use what the Bible calls our perceptive powers

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:37.140
to discern the danger that is before us and

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:45.140
Then we must take a appropriate action to find safety to make sure that we are not victimized by the danger

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.060
Now this well illustrates what Jehovah has been telling us through his word and through his organization

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.299
Jehovah is telling us today to stop

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.060
look and

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.819
listen

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:03.819
Look around you

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:07.299
discern the times that we're living it. We're living in the last days

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.259
The end is very near the great tribulation is about to take place

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:19.300
Now it's necessary to have discernment in order to come to this conclusion

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:25.539
Jesus said it was you would need discernment at Luke 17 verses 20 and 21

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.460
He says that the kingdom would not be coming with striking observableness

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:40.259
It would take discernment to understand the signs and what would mean and what action to take

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.099
This ability to discern it requires cultivation

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.020
We need to work on it. The Bible at Hebrews 5 verse 14

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:56.580
It calls it the the powers of discernment or what we used to call the perceptive powers and

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:02.780
As we learned in yesterday's text it referred to the prophet Daniel now he was exemplary in

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:12.539
Using his perceptive powers to perceive or to discern the will of God and it was necessary for him to do so

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:15.979
In order to avoid the dangerous situation that he and his

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.219
Companions were in being there in the palace at Babylon

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.219
Now Daniel continued to cultivate these powers of

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.219
discernment later on in his life

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:31.259
He made a deep study of the prophecies

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:39.099
Especially those of Jeremiah and then he concluded or discerned where they were in the stream of time that the end of the

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.939
70-year desolation of Jerusalem was coming to its conclusion and

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.300
This moved him to take specific action to prepare himself as well as other faithful Jews

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:56.300
So that they could proceed which a hois will in purpose

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.699
He therefore understood the times and events that were taking place

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.259
Because of the deep study that he did and he was able to discern

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:08.340
What was taking place in a road around him?

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:12.699
Now Jesus taught us to do something very similar

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.659
He told us to cultivate

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.860
discernment and he used a beautiful illustration to do that open your Bibles, please to the book of Luke and

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:26.089
We'll look at chapter 21 and

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:33.569
verses 29 through 31 and here at Jesus uses this technique of a stop look and listen and live

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.850
He says in verse 29

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.189
He says notice the fig tree and all the other trees so stop

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:47.110
and look around you he says in verse 31 it says and when they are budding and in other words look at these plants and

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:53.509
You see it for yourselves and know that the summer is near so discern it

00:04:54.589 --> 00:05:00.310
Proceed what is taking place here and then he tells us and listen in verse 31

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:07.149
Likewise also you when you see the things happening know that the kingdom of God is near

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:13.430
So here Jesus was telling us to stop look listen and then

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.110
We would live

00:05:16.829 --> 00:05:21.189
Now the faithful and discrete slave they're they're guided by the head of the congregation

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.910
Jesus Christ and he is providing direction to us in a very similar way

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:34.350
To help us sharpen our powers of discernment to comprehend and understand what's going on around us

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.750
It's through the pages of the watch tower and our assemblies and conventions

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.509
Here we are told to stop leave off your everyday life and concerns and

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.430
stop for a moment and then

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:49.709
Look into God's word

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:51.750
Read it

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:59.990
See what the Bible has to say about Jehovah's will and purpose and especially our time period and then take time to listen

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.509
To the explanations provided through the faithful and discrete slave

00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:11.790
About prophecies and about our time period and the nearness of the great tribulation

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.110
Now today we are receiving a very clear message

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:24.389
From Jehovah God's organization through Jesus Christ and through the faithful and discrete slave that the great

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.790
Tribulation is imminent

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.189
Now how should this information affect us?

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:38.589
Well for one thing the anxieties of life the things that immediately confront us on a day-to-day basis

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:43.829
That can sap our energy it can totally can distract us away from the bigger

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:50.389
Issues and Jesus warned us against this and if I'm going back to the book of Luke chapter 17

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:57.949
There Jesus uses the accounts of Noah as well as Sodom and Gomorrah to prove it to be a warning to us

00:06:58.829 --> 00:07:05.430
There he says that the days of the Son of Man would be like Noah and Sodom and why because people would be

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:09.189
Distracted with the mundane cares of life

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:16.589
It's these mundane cares of life that can truly dull our powers of perception

00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:25.310
We would not be able to discern where we are in the stream of time or the danger that is confronting us

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:32.589
So we have to really be careful that we don't allow these things to dollar a discern powers of discernment

00:07:33.149 --> 00:07:39.550
Otherwise we could find ourselves as wandering on to a railroad track and not really looking not listening

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:46.350
Being distracted and before you know it a train would overtake us and that's exactly what is happening to people in the world today

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:54.430
They're distracted by these things and they're failing to take notice that Jehovah God is coming at them at full speed

00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:58.029
To execute judgment against Satan's wicked world

00:07:59.189 --> 00:08:06.910
However when we sharpen our powers of discernment we clearly see the signs and Jesus said that that you would he said it looked

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:13.990
1724 that it would be like lightning flashing from one end of the sky to the other end of the sky

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:21.189
But it would be only because our powers of discernment with see these things and understand them

00:08:21.709 --> 00:08:29.709
Now we see very clearly we look around on the political world today and we can see these lightning flashes all around us Daniel's vision of the

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:39.110
Chapter two the iron and a clay of the final world power and we see how fragmented they are how weak and ineffectual this world government is

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:46.389
Second Timothy three one to five the the attitudes of people including those who are leaders in the world are

00:08:46.909 --> 00:08:48.909
arrogant and blasphemous and hotty

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:55.190
And these are clear indications that we are very near the time of the end in fact these

00:08:56.149 --> 00:09:01.429
Individuables these governments are very much like an illustration that we saw in the October 15th

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:07.750
1971 issue the watch tower of a little ant standing on a railroad track

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:10.509
And here we see God's kingdom coming at them and

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.750
We obviously see what the outcome will be

00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:16.269
They will be completely

00:09:16.789 --> 00:09:20.590
pulverized by the power and speed of Jehovah's

00:09:21.029 --> 00:09:23.029
Executional forces

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:27.990
So we see therefore it's important for us to have

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:36.830
sharpen our powers of discernment to cultivate this quality so that we are not caught off guard that we always see the danger and can take

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:38.669
appropriate action

00:09:38.669 --> 00:09:44.789
So every day let us stop look and listen to Jehovah's warnings

00:09:45.309 --> 00:09:52.389
This will help us stay out of the danger zone and we'll be able to survive the end of the system of things and the great

00:09:52.549 --> 00:09:55.029
Tribulation will not catch us off guard
