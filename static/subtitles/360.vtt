WEBVTT

00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:06.230
And so we're talking about technology today.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.230
And as has been mentioned by our commenters,

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.230
Jehovah's organization is certainly making good, positive use

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.230
of technology to get the good news preached.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.230
Every week we receive letters of appreciation

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.230
from those who have been watching JWB, JW Broadcasting.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.230
They just love to watch the programs.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.229
And this morning, I'd like to talk a little bit more

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:36.229
about our website, JW.org.

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:41.229
Did you know that many people are first recognizing

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:45.229
the sound of the truth through JW.org,

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:48.229
even before they have had a personal contact

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:51.229
with the Jehovah's Witness? It's true.

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:54.229
And I'd like to share some experiences with you this morning.

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:57.229
The first one has to do with Kajja.

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:01.229
She was dissatisfied with her church.

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.230
And so she decided to investigate various religions.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.230
Now, in the old days, people would just go from one church

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.230
to the other, but modern day people go on the website.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.230
And they want to know what various churches teach.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.230
And as she was investigating the teaching of various religions,

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.230
she noticed that there were a lot of negative comments

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.230
about Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.230
Did that stop her? No, because she was a fair-minded person.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.230
So she went online and found our website.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:41.230
And she found the frequently asked questions section of the website.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.230
And she loved it.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.230
Every question was answered with the Bible.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.230
And that's what she wanted in a religion.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.230
Well, she noticed on our website that there was an invitation

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.230
to attend our meetings.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.230
And so she talked to schoolmate into going with her to the Kingdom Hall.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.230
She was a schoolgirl.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.230
Now, she loved what she heard at the Kingdom Hall,

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.230
and she was so warmly welcomed.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.229
But wouldn't you know it? Her parents were opposed.

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:16.229
And soon after she made that one foray to the Kingdom Hall,

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:19.229
they moved to an isolated area where there were none

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:22.229
of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:29.229
And Kaja was caught off from any association with the Witnesses for one year.

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:33.229
But not to be deterred.

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:38.229
She studied all of our publications on the website.

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:41.229
And she kept up to date with the truth.

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:47.229
In September of 2014, she was again able to make contact with the Witnesses

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:49.229
and she accepted a Bible study.

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:54.229
And in July 2015, she was baptized.

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:55.229
So she got the truth.

00:02:55.229 --> 00:03:01.229
Her initial contact with the truth was on at www.org.

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:04.229
Now, speaking of being cut off from the Witnesses,

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:06.229
that's Kenji's problem.

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:08.229
He's a 15-year-old boy in Japan.

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:12.229
He would love to attend meetings at the Kingdom Hall.

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:15.229
But his father forbids him from attending.

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:18.229
But here's what Kenji has to say.

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:24.229
He says, I watch JW Broadcasting and JW.org every day.

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:28.229
I see brothers doing their best, and that encourages me.

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:31.229
One day I will become a great brother.

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:33.229
Please wait.

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:38.610
While speaking of lifelines, we were at a circuit assembly

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.610
in St. Louis, Missouri, over the weekend.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.610
And a sister told me that she had been very gravely ill

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.610
for a whole year, so ill that she couldn't attend the meetings

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.610
and she wasn't able to tie in to the meetings.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:59.610
But she said her lifeline was JW Broadcasting and JW.org.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:06.610
So these technological innovations are really accomplishing a good work.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.610
Let's talk about Alinka.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.610
She's a physics teacher.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.610
And one day she was at the home of an acquaintance

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.610
and there was a strange man there, a man that she didn't know.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.610
But she was really impressed with this man.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.610
He was so friendly, so warm and kind and balanced too.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.610
And after he left, she mentioned that to the householder.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.610
And the householder said, it's all true, what you say.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.610
But there's one problem.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.610
He's one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.610
Another negative comment about Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.610
What did she do?

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.610
She went home and she went online.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.610
And she found her website.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:52.610
For five months, she carefully studied all of the material on our website.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.610
And at the end of five months, she decided to go to the Kingdom Hall.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.610
And she made a very interesting comment, something I hadn't really thought about.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:05.610
She said, thanks to JW.org, nothing in the hall seemed strange to me.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.610
The program, the people, all of it was familiar.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.610
After she attended meetings for a month, she asked for a Bible study.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.610
So she was careful, but she got the truth.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.610
And her first encounter after that man was our website.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.610
Dregan was a Franciscan monk in Slovenia.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.610
He'd been in the order for a number of years, but there was something missing.

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.610
There was a void in his life.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.610
He realized that his religion was not satisfying his spiritual need.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.610
So he went online and he joined a chat room with a bunch of evangelicals.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.610
Well, as you can imagine, eventually some negative comments were made about Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.610
Did that stop Dregan?

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:52.610
No.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.610
Another fear-minded person.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:01.610
He thought it's not fair to criticize Jehovah's Witnesses when, thankfully,

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.610
none of Jehovah's Witnesses are in that chat room.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:12.610
So he went online and found her website, and he was delighted with the quality of the website.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:17.610
Now he was a monk, and in the Franciscan order, that particular Franciscan order,

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:22.610
the monks were only allowed to leave the monastery on Mondays.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:27.610
So one day he found the address of the branch office in Slovenia,

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.610
and a Monday morning he went to the branch and got a tour.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.610
And the brothers received him very warmly.

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:40.610
He was very impressed with what he saw, and he came away with a novel idea.

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:46.610
He came away with the thought that he should be reading the Bible every day.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:52.610
And so he went back to the monastery, went online, and started reading the Bible online every day.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.610
His fellow monks observed this, and they thought this was hilarious.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.610
What's the Catholic monk doing reading the Bible?

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.610
But he didn't allow their opposition to deter him.

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:07.610
He kept reading the Bible, and then kept consulting JW.org,

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:14.610
and he realized on consulting the website that the memorial that year was on a Monday.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:21.610
So he was going to be able to attend, and he did, and that did it.

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.610
That meeting.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:29.610
He made the decision to leave the Catholic church and to leave the monastery.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.610
So now there were a lot of challenges to overcome.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:35.610
It wasn't so easy, but he persevered.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:41.610
And in June of 2014, he left the church, he left the monastery,

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:47.610
and then in the month of October of that same year, he was baptized as one of Jehovah's Witnesses,

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:52.610
since he has served as an auxiliary pioneer.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:57.610
As Sister in Finland, he was studying with the Bulgarian woman,

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:01.610
and one day the woman asked her to drive her to the hospital.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:03.610
Oh, are you ill?

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:08.610
Well, the woman hemmed and hot, and finally she admitted she wanted to have an abortion.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:13.610
Well, as Sister said, I can't, my conscience won't allow me to drive you to the hospital for that,

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:18.610
and then she shared some scriptures with the woman on God's view of life.

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:20.610
But then she had an idea.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:25.610
At the end of every study, and here's something that you might want to implement,

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:30.610
at the end of every study, she shows the woman something from the website,

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.610
and she remembered something.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:40.610
Song number 88, children, a trust from God, had come out in the Bulgarian language

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:43.610
as sung by a children's chorus.

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:48.610
So she played song 88 to the woman in the Bulgarian language.

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:53.610
The woman's heart was touched, and she canceled the abortion.

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:55.610
She said, I'm going to have the baby.

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:58.610
If it's a boy, his name will be Angel.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:05.610
If it's a girl, Angelina, because God protected the child.

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:08.610
And I think the children's chorus helped a little bit too.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:16.620
Now, we have, for years, been encouraging pioneers and publishers

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:20.620
who conduct Bible studies to direct interest to the organization.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.620
And we printed a brochure.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.620
And then we printed a simplified brochure with many pictures.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.620
And these brochures have had some success.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:34.620
But I think what has really opened the eyes of the brothers and our Bible students

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:40.620
to the organization has been JW Broadcasting and JW.org.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:45.620
And you see now as you go from one congregation to another or one circuit to another

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:50.620
that the brothers are really talking about the organization as they never did before.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:56.620
So it's obvious that technology has contributed to the understanding of the brothers

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.620
and to the spread of the good news.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.620
Now, here's a warning.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.620
Technology has a place.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.620
It has a big place.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.620
But there is a danger.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:11.620
Have you ever heard the term fubbing?

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.620
Fubbing?

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.620
P-H-U-B-B-I-N-G.

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:21.620
It's a combination of foam and snubbing.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:27.620
And it refers to the act of ignoring real people while consulting an electronic device.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.620
So picture a man and a woman in a restaurant.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:32.620
And each one is online.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:37.620
Each one is consulting a different website or answering mail.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.620
And they're not talking to each other.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:44.620
It's a real problem, according to a study by Baylor University.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:49.620
So what we want to do is to stay connected, not just to the internet,

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:54.620
but to stay connected to real people to those around us.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:59.620
A brother John Barr of the governing body used to say that if we shut out those around us

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:05.620
while consulting an electronic device, we're really not focusing on the sounds of life.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:09.620
We are missing the sounds of life.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:15.620
And we're also missing out on opportunities to strengthen our bond with others.
