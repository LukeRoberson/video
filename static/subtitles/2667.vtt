00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:07.360
When I started studying the Bible, there were various factors that hindered my study.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.359
I was a truck driver and I was on the road a lot.

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:14.359
I had the worst kind of friendships and I smoked.

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:17.359
I smoked an average 60 cigarettes a day.

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:23.359
I realised that if I was going to make the needed adjustments, I had to change my profession.

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:28.359
So I changed my job, but if I wanted to get baptized, I had to stop smoking.

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.359
I cut down to two or three cigarettes a day.

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:36.359
One day I bought a single cigarette.

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:40.359
I lit it and I prayed to Jehovah.

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:46.119
I begged him to help me and he did help me.

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:52.119
So much so that I never smoked again and to this day I don't even have the urge to smoke.

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:57.119
Ten years after my first Bible study I was baptized.

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:03.119
I've been serving Jehovah for 20 years now, along with my wife and all my children.
