00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:20.910
My name is Faustino Camacho Quispe.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:30.980
My family and I speak Quechoa, or, as we say, Runasimi, the language of the people.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:37.200
We live in an agricultural community in the mountains of Peru.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.799
Our way of life depends on farming.

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:48.640
We grow crops such as corn, potatoes, wheat, and quinoa.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.710
We also raise a small amount of livestock.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.270
Many people who speak Quechoa have moved to larger cities, but others like us still enjoy

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.909
a more traditional way of life in the country.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.909
My family and I are Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.030
Most of our brothers and sisters in this area would never have been able to learn the truth

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.469
had there not been anyone sent here to preach in Quechoa.

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:36.870
In 1992, the Peru branch office began to expand the work in the Quechoan language field.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.629
In order to reach those living in isolated areas, zealous brothers and sisters climbed

00:01:41.629 --> 00:01:48.840
narrow roads in the frigid elevations of the Andes Mountains.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.400
Great efforts were made in order to bring Quechoa speaking people the good news in their

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.920
own language.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.879
The people loved having publications in their mother tongue.

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:07.239
However, there were some challenges carrying out this work.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.080
Some problem was not having a good translation of the Holy Scriptures in Quechoa.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.800
The commonly used translations here in Peru omit God's name in the main text.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.800
It can be found in the glossary of some Bibles, and sometimes we use that in order to preach.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.719
But even so, it didn't have the same impact as seeing it in its proper place.

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:35.919
That along with the influence of false doctrines made it difficult for us to teach the truth.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.599
When we teach people about the Bible, we want them to draw close to God.

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.080
We want them to become his friends.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.599
But no one can be God's friend if they don't know his name.

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.560
For people to be able to come to love God, they have to know his name, and they have

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.860
to understand what it means.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.620
It was difficult for us to use the Bible in the meetings, in the field ministry, and

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.539
in our family worship.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:23.740
How could Jehovah's great name be sanctified throughout this mountainous region?

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.379
How could the Quechua people get to know God when his name was hidden?

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.340
The answer to our prayers came when Quechua congregations throughout the country were

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.620
invited to a special program on May 1, 2016.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.419
Imagine the great joy we felt when Brother Jackson of the Governing Body announced the

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:48.300
release of the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures in two cultural

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.300
languages.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.849
It's Quechua Pusko.

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.770
That's what Pusko, can you be us?

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.649
A lot of wonderful gifts we've received today.

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:30.569
This new Quechua Bible is a grand victory for Jehovah's great name.

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:37.129
God's name is no longer hidden from the Quechua people, giving them the precious opportunity

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:41.250
to come to know our loving Creator, Jehovah.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.430
I feel proud to use our new Bible to teach my family and neighbors Jehovah's

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:11.430
name.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:17.269
I am thankful every day that Jehovah sent this good news to the mountains to us who speak

00:05:17.269 --> 00:05:19.870
RunaSimi, the language of the people.
