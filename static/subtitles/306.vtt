00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:16.219
As a family, we were doing very well spiritually, we did family worship, preaching and going to the meetings together.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.219
After some time, we began to encounter financial problems.

00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:28.679
At times, we did not even have money to buy food for each day.

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:33.679
Many people in our area were going to South Africa to provide basic needs for their families.

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:36.679
So I decided to go as well.

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:51.280
Leaving behind my wife to take care of our seven children.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.280
This affected me spiritually, because I did not know the language, I was unable to preach,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.280
and I did not benefit from the meetings.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:07.280
Being so far from my family caused me to neglect my responsibility as a family head.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:14.280
As a result, my family grew weak spiritually, and we all missed each other very much.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.280
I realized that I had made a wrong decision going abroad.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.280
My conscience started to trouble me greatly.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.280
Then I remembered the example of Barrick, founded Jeremiah chapter 45, verse 5.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.140
Barrick may have wanted to pursue material riches as I had.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.450
When he was helped, he returned.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:45.450
I decided then to put Jehovah in first place instead of searching for material things.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.450
So I started to make changes to go home and help my family spiritually.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:02:00.079
When I left South Africa and reached the border of Malawi after leaving my family for about six months,

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:07.079
I felt great happiness in my heart, and I am still happy till now.

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.080
Studying the Bible has helped me.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.080
We still encounter financial problems, but I remember that in Satan's world,

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.080
there is no way we can go and have no problems.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.080
Now I serve as an elder.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.080
My family is progressing spiritually, and this makes me very happy,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.080
because my relationship with Jehovah is strong.
