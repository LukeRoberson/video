00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:08.859
Some secular authorities have drawn wrong conclusions about the involvement of the congregation

00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:16.339
of Jehovah's Witnesses when an individual commits a serious wrong that violates both civil

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:20.539
law and scriptural law.

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:26.820
Part of the misunderstanding involves our use of the term judicial committee.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.740
Some erroneously conclude that the congregation is trying to take over the work of the police

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:41.420
or the judicial courts, and that's simply not the case, as explained in the May 2019

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.259
Watchdower page 7 that our comments are taken from here today.

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:52.820
So let's briefly review the history of handling judicial matters amongst God's people.

00:00:52.899 --> 00:01:03.460
I'd like to do so under this theme, older men and superior authorities standing in their proper place.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:11.939
Now, it is important to remember that Jehovah has always and will always be the judge over all the

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:20.500
year. That's a carnivid genesis 18 and verse 25. But how Jehovah has his judgment determined

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.980
and the punishment administered has changed over a period of time, who he allows to do that.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.579
At first, of course, he was the judge. You take Adam and Eve, right? He made the decision.

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.260
It was a swift action. He pronounced the sentence and moved him right out of the garden of Eden

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:46.260
immediately. But Jehovah God has never abdicated his authority as the universal judge, but as time

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:53.859
has gone on and the human family has grown, then he delegated judicial authority to others.

00:01:53.859 --> 00:02:00.340
Now, the first were the patriarchs, and they would then handle matters within their own family

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.980
units. And then later, Israel started to grow. There were hundreds of thousands, and so older

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:14.180
men were appointed to handle matters within the nation. But remember, at a time then, they were

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:21.139
also in Egypt, and they were in captivity as slaves. And so this group of older men would have

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:29.699
limits on their judicial authority, but that limit was about to change. Because the Israelites left

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:39.379
the Egyptian bondage in Nyson 14, 1513 BCE. And about a year later, then they went into a covenant

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:45.460
with Jehovah God called the law covenant. So, Jehovah gave laws that would include all the

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:51.939
aspects of their life. Now, sometime later, notice what Jehovah said to Moses. I'm going to

00:02:51.939 --> 00:03:00.819
Numbers 11 and verse 16. Numbers 11, 16. Jehovah replied to Moses,

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:09.460
gather for me 70 men from the elders of Israel, men whom you recognize as elders and officials

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:18.180
of the people. So, these 70 men chosen from all of the elders, then were special officers.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:26.979
So, think about it now. The Israel had a national law, and now they had an arrangement of older men

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:34.500
that could enforce the law. This was a sovereign nation under Jehovah God. So, all aspects,

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:43.780
spiritually, a civil, a criminal wrongdoing, it was all handled by the older men. They would hear

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.939
the matter, they would render judgment, they would assist the victim, and they would administer

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:57.780
appropriate discipline. But in time, the nomadic Israelites then took over the promised land,

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:04.020
and they went back to dwelling in fixed homes, and they then had communities. But these were

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:12.500
special boundaries where Jehovah's law was the law of the land. The older men became responsible

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:19.540
for handling it on a community level. They acted as judges, they would administer justice,

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.459
they made sure there was good order, they maintained peace, and they also handled the spiritual

00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:36.180
needs of the community. Now, this was the Israel's judicial system for 900 years, from 1513 BCE

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:45.459
to 607 when Jerusalem was destroyed. This was a unique period in the time of God's people.

00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:53.620
It was the only time when God's people, as a nation, were in complete control of their entire

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:04.259
judicial process. During this time, only Jehovah's law was applied within Israel's fixed boundaries.

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:10.740
But notice the change that happened when the Babylonians took over and conquered Jerusalem

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:22.550
in 607. We'll go to Deuteronomy chapter 28 and verse 64. It says, Jehovah will scatter you among

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:28.790
all the nations from the one end of the earth to the other end of the earth. And that's exactly

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:35.589
what happened. They no longer were going to be in Israel. They would be in communities far

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:41.430
away from Israel. Under the Persian rule, there were scattered in 127 districts. And the Greek

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:49.990
rule, Alexander the Great, brought many of the Jews to his new city, Alexandria, under the Roman

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:57.589
rule, they allowed Jewish communities within their cities throughout their empire. So,

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:04.949
though these old men lived in these communities, see the local laws would be enforced by the local

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:11.110
secular authorities. And that's, according to what the Apostle Paul said in Romans 13, verse 1,

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:17.589
that were the superior authorities that he had referenced too. So here's the question,

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:27.189
when the Christian congregation was established, would the entire judicial process, both civil

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:34.550
and scriptural, once again be handled by the old men in the congregation? Well, the answer is

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:43.910
no. And for good reason. Now, it's true, the global brotherhood would all be unified under one

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:51.509
scriptural law. And that scriptural law would be applied in every congregation, no matter what land,

00:06:51.509 --> 00:07:00.149
what country they were in. But what about the secular laws, governing civil and criminal matters?

00:07:00.149 --> 00:07:07.670
Well, unlike the scriptural law, secular laws are specific to the land that they govern.

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:15.589
For instance, secular authorities definition of crime and enforcement of penalties are not

00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:22.069
consistent from land to land. I take this example, substance abuse. Well, what constitutes illegal

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:28.870
abuse? What's the quantity consumed that would make it illegal? If you're driving

00:07:29.829 --> 00:07:34.629
some vehicle and you're under the influence, what's the punishment if there is any punishment?

00:07:35.509 --> 00:07:41.350
You see, the answer to those questions really vary widely from country to country. In fact, even from

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:48.709
state to state at times. So it's up to the secular governments to determine the penalties and to

00:07:48.709 --> 00:07:55.990
enforce them. So in conclusion, Jehovah allows the superior authorities, the governments as it were,

00:07:56.629 --> 00:08:04.870
to prosecute and administer civil and criminal law. Now, the authorities are vested

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:11.750
with the power to punish those who violate those laws. That too is an accord with Romans chapter 13.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:20.870
The Christian congregation is not and never has been a substitute for the secular authorities.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:27.750
And that's why the congregation does not shield individuals from this secular arrangement.

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:36.230
Now, it's true. If a member of the congregation commits a sin that is also a crime in the

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:43.110
eyes of the secular law, then of course the secular law will handle that. But Jehovah allows the

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:52.389
congregation elders to handle the spiritual or scriptural aspect of the sin. And this would then

00:08:52.389 --> 00:09:00.389
assures that his name and his reputation are upheld and the parties themselves are able to be

00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:08.710
helped spiritually. So in this way, prior to the new world of righteousness, the judge of all the

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:19.350
earth uses older men and the superior authorities both standing in their proper place to accomplish his will.
