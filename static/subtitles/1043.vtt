00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:05.259
Two Israelite men sneak into the city of Jericho.

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:06.900
The men are spies.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.580
They take refuge in a place where they feel no one will notice them.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.500
The home of a prostitute, Rahab.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.699
And little does Rahab know how the visit of these two men will affect her life.

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.780
But someone recognizes the spies, and they notify the king.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.660
The king sends men to take the spies into custody.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.260
As the king's men bang on the door, Rahab is confronted with a life or death

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.619
decision, a decision that will affect her livelihood and the lives of everyone in her

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:39.100
family.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.100
Will she take a stand for Jehovah's people?

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.899
Or will she side with the king of Jericho?

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.299
As you watch the following video, imagine the challenges that Rahab faced, and notice what

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:58.890
helped her to make a life-saving decision.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.969
Jericho was doomed.

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:02.689
People were scared.

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:08.209
When the Israelite men showed up at my door, there was barely time to think.

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:11.170
But I knew what was at stake.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.530
Even as a young girl, I had heard all the stories.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.489
Jehovah wasn't like the other gods.

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:24.530
He had dried up the waters of the Red Sea, and given his people victory over the Amorites.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.969
If I helped these men, I knew Jehovah would help me.

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:40.010
For the first time in my life, I was standing with Jehovah's people on Jehovah's side.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:48.010
And my faith was being rewarded.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.569
The spies were probably the first Israelites that Rahab had ever met.

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:59.209
Yet she was convinced that if she helped the two men, that Jehovah would help her.

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:01.370
Why did she feel that way?

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.650
Please open your vibals to Hebrews chapter 11, and we're going to read verse 31.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.250
And here we find the answer to that question in a single word.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.250
Hebrews 11.31 says,

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.650
By faith, Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who acted disobediently because

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.370
she received the spies in a peaceable way.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.330
Yes, Rahab took a decisive stand based on her faith in what she had heard about Jehovah.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.770
How he had delivered his people at the Red Sea, how he had given them victories over nearby kings.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:45.569
The account in Joshua chapter 2 describes the significant sequence of events.

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:51.090
Rahab had already hidden the spies on her roof before the kingsmen arrived.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.330
And after sending the kingsmen away, she went back up to the roof to talk to the spies.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.610
There she explained to them the reasons for her faith.

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:11.330
And she expressed confidence that Jehovah is the true God and that Jehovah would give his people victory over Jericho.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:18.370
Only then did she ask the spies for protection for herself and her family.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.650
So Rahab's faith was not based on the promise of a reward.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:31.009
Rather, her faith was based on her firm conviction that Jehovah is the Almighty God.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.370
Rahab's faith gave her courage to hide and protect the spies,

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.169
and then her faith moved her to obey the spies on usual instructions.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:47.009
In the following dramatization, notice how a young Bible student

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:49.650
shows faith like that of Rahab.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.409
There was no doubt about it.

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:58.610
I had found the truth.

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:03.889
So why did I feel so anxious?

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.079
I knew how mom felt about the holidays.

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:31.939
I also learned how Jehovah felt.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.920
They displeased him.

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.259
Some changes in my life were easy to make,

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.019
but I really needed Jehovah's help for what I had to do next.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.579
I love my mom so much.

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:16.160
When I explained that I wouldn't celebrate the holidays anymore,

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:29.069
I could tell that she was hurt, but I knew I was doing the right thing,

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.310
and prayed that Jehovah would help her understand.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.500
I admit I was surprised when she said she wanted to learn more.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:15.420
What a blessing.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:23.100
Thanks to Jehovah, I have found the truth, and now maybe my family would find it too.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.439
Like Rahab, this Bible student had already identified the true God.

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:38.480
She was convinced that she had found the truth,

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:41.920
but now she needed to act on that faith,

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.040
and she was blessed when she took a stand on Jehovah's side.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.720
Each of us must ask ourselves, am I standing firmly on Jehovah's side?

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:59.360
Perhaps you feel that you don't have enough knowledge to take a stand?

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.720
If so, imitate Rahab and do not hesitate.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.959
What little knowledge Rahab had about Jehovah was enough to give her faith

00:07:10.959 --> 00:07:14.399
that moved her to take prompt, obedient action.

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:19.759
But Rahab had to do more than protect the spies and follow their instructions.

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:28.160
James 2, verse 25, states that Rahab was declared righteous by her works.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:35.439
Remember, she was a prostitute, a work that is not in harmony with Jehovah's righteous standards.

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:39.360
The Canaanites didn't view prostitution as something bad.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:45.120
However, in order to be accepted as one of Jehovah's clean worshipers,

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:49.600
Rahab had to abandon her immoral way of life.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:58.800
Likewise today, all who want to please Jehovah must abandon any lifestyles or conduct that

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:07.759
displeases him. This includes sexual immorality, idolatry, theft, drunkenness, and customs that are

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:16.180
not in harmony with the Scriptures. Rahab and her family certainly were grateful that her faithful

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:23.379
actions led to their salvation. But that wasn't all that Jehovah did to bless this woman of strong

00:08:23.379 --> 00:08:30.019
faith. She also had the privilege of becoming an ancestor of the Messiah, Jesus Christ.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:39.539
Therefore, may all of us imitate the faith of Rahab and may that faith move us to action,

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:47.379
to abandon immoral conduct and false religious customs, to take our stand for Jehovah and his

00:08:47.379 --> 00:08:55.620
pure worship, to continue to grow in knowledge of God and to draw closer to Him as our loving Heavenly

00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:03.779
Father. If we show faith like that of Rahab, we will enjoy Jehovah's favor and blessing forever.

00:09:05.539 --> 00:09:11.220
Brother Ken Flodin, a helper to the Teaching Committee, will now present the next talk of this

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:21.940
symposium, imitate women of strong faith, Hannah.
