00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.549
I'd like to talk about a very common expression in the Bible.

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:11.550
The expression is, I am with you.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.550
13 times, it's attributed to a statement from Jehovah.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.550
Three times, it's something that Jesus said to one or more of His disciples.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:30.550
Of course, there are dozens of other times that the same sentiment is expressed using similar wording.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:38.549
Few things in the world equal the joy humans experience than the birth of a child.

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:47.549
As children grow up, they are sometimes exposed to situations that tend to cause nervousness or even fear.

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:56.549
So a parent may occasionally feel compelled to reassure a child, have no fear, I am with you.

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:02.859
Jehovah loves His servants as if they were His children.

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:09.859
Likewise, at John 13, one, Jesus' feelings for His disciples are well expressed.

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:18.859
There it says, Jesus, having loved His own who were in the world, loved them to the end.

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:33.859
So when we face fears, trials or causes for anxiety, both our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus, we assuredly say, I am with you.

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:36.859
Think of the righteous man, Noah.

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:41.859
Genesis 6.9 says that Noah walked with the true God.

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:45.859
There's no doubt that Jehovah was with Noah.

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:49.859
He preserved Him and His family through the flood.

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:54.859
Afterward, Jehovah further proved He was with Noah.

00:01:54.859 --> 00:02:00.859
In Genesis 9, Jehovah said, I am now establishing my covenant with you.

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:06.859
Never again will all flesh be destroyed by the waters of a flood.

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:13.860
Jehovah could have made that determination and promised Himself that He wouldn't do that again.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:26.860
But instead, He reached out to Noah and reassured Him that He was with Him by making the rainbow covenant with Noah and His offspring.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:38.860
Using similar terminology, Jehovah indicated that He was with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Joshua and Gideon.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:47.860
They were all individuals that Jehovah was pleased with, so He reassured them He was with them.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.860
How about a group of people?

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.860
Is Jehovah moved to feel the same way toward a large crowd of His servants collectively?

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:05.139
Please find with me Exodus 6, verse 6 and 7.

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:15.990
The whole nation of Israel was experiencing severe trials and suffering as slaves in Egypt.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.990
Notice Jehovah's reassurance to the fast number of people.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:41.990
Verse 6 and 7, state, therefore, say to the Israelites, I am Jehovah and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians and rescue you from their slavery and I will reclaim you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:53.990
And I will take you in as my people and I will be your God and you will certainly know that I am Jehovah your God who is bringing you out from under the burdens of Egypt.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:04:02.990
If that great mixed group of people would follow His leadings, He said He'd take them in, He would be their God.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.990
What was He saying? He was reassuring them.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.990
I will be with you.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:26.990
And He was, for 40 years in the wilderness, He was with them, feeding them, providing water for them, ensuring their clothes and sandals would not weigh out, protecting them from poisonous snakes and so forth.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:34.990
And later, when entering the land of promise, He protected them during enemy warfare.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:44.990
Jehovah promised to be with and to support the kings of Israel as long as they heeded His commandments and direction.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:54.990
King Solomon was told, Jehovah, you God will not desert you or abandon you but He will be with you.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:05.620
King Asa was informed, Jehovah is with you as long as you remain with Him.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:16.620
When faced with overwhelming enemy forces, King Jehosephat was told, tomorrow go out against them and Jehovah will be with you.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:26.899
Jehovah also proved to be with the many prophets that he sent out in his name, just one example is Jeremiah.

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:42.899
Imagine if you had Jeremiah's assignment, suppose you had been directed to deliver a scathing denunciation and judgment against wicked kings, corrupt priests and false prophets, how would you feel?

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:51.899
Underqualified? Would you feel like a little child challenging a whole group of evil grown-ups?

00:05:51.899 --> 00:06:01.899
Notice how Jeremiah felt as he expressed himself at Jeremiah chapter 1 verse 6.

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:10.899
But I said, alas or so in Lord Jehovah, I do not know how to speak for I am just a boy.

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:15.899
What were Jehovah's reassuring words in reply?

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:25.899
Jeremiah 1, 8 and 9, do not be afraid because of their appearance for I am with you to save you, declares Jehovah.

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:34.899
Then Jehovah stretched out his hand and touched my mouth and Jehovah said to me, I have put my words in your mouth.

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:43.899
If Jehovah put the words that you were to say in your mouth, you'd no longer feel like a little child, would you?

00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:51.899
We don't think of Jeremiah as being an incredible Superman, he was a human like us.

00:06:51.899 --> 00:07:01.899
It's of interest that though Jeremiah lived in another time and place, he faced situations similar to those we face.

00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:11.899
We interact with different types of people in our daily life at work and at school, some of them can be intimidating.

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:18.899
And like Jeremiah, Jehovah has commissioned us to go to strangers and preach.

00:07:18.899 --> 00:07:21.899
We share the good news of the kingdom.

00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:26.899
Some are interested, others are just plain apathetic.

00:07:26.899 --> 00:07:33.899
But at times we may come across someone who is angry and may even be threatening.

00:07:33.899 --> 00:07:37.899
This is the time to remember Jeremiah.

00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:47.899
Though initially timid, he courageously faced the challenge of an intimidating response.

00:07:47.899 --> 00:07:50.899
How did he rally to the occasion?

00:07:50.899 --> 00:07:57.899
It was because Jehovah had reassured him, I am with you.

00:07:57.899 --> 00:08:04.240
He said, I have put my words in your mouth.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.240
Does Jehovah do something similar for us?

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.240
Yes.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:17.240
Long after Jeremiah and the other faithful ones that were recorded in the Hebrew Scriptures came and went,

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:24.490
Jehovah has proved to be with true Christians both past and present.

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:27.490
Find with me John chapter 8.

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:32.820
Think of Jesus.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:38.820
It's true he was a perfect man, but did Jehovah leave him all alone?

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:43.820
Did John 816, what did Jesus himself say?

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:53.820
And yet even if I do judge, my judgment is truthful because I am not alone, but the father who sent me is with me.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:58.820
We might be thinking of that intimidating person in the ministry.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:03.820
Even if you are facing the person without the fellow witness standing beside you,

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:07.820
are you really all alone?

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:15.820
Jesus knew that at the most stressful and emotionally draining time during his human life,

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:22.820
his disciples would leave him all alone, but was he really alone?

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:28.820
Let's read the inspired account at John 1632.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.820
Again, these are Jesus' own words.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:38.820
Look, the hour is coming, indeed it has come, when each one of you will be scattered to his own house,

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:46.820
and you will leave me alone, but I am not alone because the father is with me.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:54.820
Jesus was not alone during his most anxious moments, Jehovah was with him.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:10:01.820
If you think you are alone standing at the door of an irritated householder, think again.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.820
Jehovah is with you.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:14.820
You have more with you than if you had your whole congregation standing in the persons front yard.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:20.820
Well, why did Jesus share this precious insight with us?

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.820
Look at the next verse.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:29.820
Jesus explains his reason for saying what he did, John 1633.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:35.820
I have said these things to you so that by means of me you may have peace.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:42.820
In the world you will have tribulation, but take courage, I have conquered the world.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:49.820
We thank Jesus for addressing our fears and concerns when giving a witness.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:58.820
Instead of trembling with fear, he shared his confidence in Jehovah's support so that we may have peace.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:08.820
He acknowledged that we would face tribulation, but he said we could look at his example and have courage to deal with the tribulation.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:10.820
Why?

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:17.820
Jesus said in verse 32, it was because the Father was with him.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:31.820
Do you recall that Jehovah told Jeremiah, I have put my words in your mouth, can Jehovah do the same for us when we are opposed by unbelievers?

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:37.820
The Christian Greek scriptures answer with a resounding yes.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:44.820
Let's follow along with the reading of the book of Mark chapter 13.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:53.820
And please notice that the setting Jesus describes is the ministry preaching the good news.

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:59.820
Maybe you have had a good morning in service, but then you take one more door.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:03.820
The person is irate and even calls the police.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.820
What should you do?

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:09.820
What will you say when the police arrive?

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.820
You don't have to be overly concerned.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.820
Why not?

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:22.820
Because similar to Jeremiah, Jehovah will in effect put his words in your mouth.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:26.820
Mark 13, 10 and 11 says,

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:31.820
also in all the nations, the good news has to be preached first.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:40.820
And when they are taking you to hand you over, do not be anxious beforehand about what to say.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:50.820
But whatever is given to you in that hour, say this, for you are not the one speaking, but the Holy Spirit is.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:59.820
By this, do we mean that Jehovah will miraculously put words in your mouth for you to say?

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.820
Not necessarily.

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:08.820
Did you notice verse 11 said that the Holy Spirit is the one speaking?

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:13.820
You have been taught the basis for your faith from the scriptures.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:17.820
And you know the reason that you teach the Bible's message.

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:21.820
That's all stored in your mind.

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:30.820
So what's the Holy Spirit's role when we are in an intimidating situation, when sharing the good news?

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.820
Jehovah is with you.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:42.820
He uses his Holy Spirit to bring to the surface some of those precious gems that might be buried in your mind.

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:53.820
You may be amazed at what you remember when put under pressure by the authorities or even by outright opposers.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:57.820
In this way, Jehovah is with you.

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:04.259
Add to the fact that Jesus is with you and the disciples making work.

00:14:04.259 --> 00:14:14.259
Let's be reminded of this very encouraging thought at Matthew 28, 19 and 20.

00:14:14.259 --> 00:14:20.259
Jesus was discussing our commission to preach, teach, and make disciples.

00:14:20.259 --> 00:14:24.259
And how does he conclude the Bible book of Matthew?

00:14:24.259 --> 00:14:29.259
Let's read Matthew 28 verses 19 and 20.

00:14:30.259 --> 00:14:41.259
Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,

00:14:41.259 --> 00:14:46.259
teaching them to observe all the things I've commanded you.

00:14:46.259 --> 00:14:53.259
And look, I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.

00:14:54.259 --> 00:15:00.259
Jesus said that he is with us now when we are making disciples and teaching people the truth,

00:15:00.259 --> 00:15:09.259
and he promises he'll support us in this important work until the end of this wicked system of things.

00:15:09.259 --> 00:15:19.259
As prophesied during this time of the conclusion of the system, we are being persecuted in different areas of the world.

00:15:19.259 --> 00:15:27.259
As the scriptures show Satan and his angels are misleading the entire inhabited earth.

00:15:27.259 --> 00:15:31.259
Recently, Jehovah's people have been persecuted in Russia.

00:15:31.259 --> 00:15:38.259
But will the persecution succeed in eliminating true worship in that area of the world?

00:15:38.259 --> 00:15:41.259
No. Why not?

00:15:41.259 --> 00:15:45.259
It's because Jehovah is with them.

00:15:46.259 --> 00:15:51.259
He and Jesus promised, I am with you.

00:15:51.259 --> 00:15:54.259
Russia did not learn from the past.

00:15:54.259 --> 00:16:00.259
It will prove to be the same for them as it was for Nazi Germany under Hitler.

00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:10.259
Hitler thought his regime could eradicate true worship and God's people from areas under their control, but they made a big mistake.

00:16:10.259 --> 00:16:14.259
While it is true, they murdered some 2,000 brothers.

00:16:14.259 --> 00:16:18.259
In the end, the scheme ended up in failure.

00:16:18.259 --> 00:16:25.600
Why? Because God was with us, not with them.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:36.600
God with us, those words have decorated national emblems and even the uniforms of soldiers of pressure and the Sari's Russian Empire.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:45.600
These words were also on the belts of German troops when they marched into Belgium in the year 1914 of our common era.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:52.600
But they had it wrong. The sovereign Lord Jehovah was with us, not with them.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:58.600
He is with all of us now. He will be with us during Armageddon.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:05.599
He will be with us after Armageddon. He will be with us at the end of the thousand year reign of Christ.

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:20.599
He will be with mankind at the end of hundred thousand years. He will be with humans at the end of hundred million years and at the end of hundred million years times hundred million years.

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:31.599
Jehovah will be with mankind forever and so will Jesus. They are both on record as saying, I am with you.
