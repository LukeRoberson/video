00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.750
Our theme this month is feed your hope.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:10.750
Hope is essential for peace, happiness, courage, and life.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.750
But what is hope?

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.750
When the Bible uses the word hope, it's referring not only to the desire for something good,

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.750
but also to the basis for believing it will happen.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.750
So hope is more than just wishful thinking or even expectation.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.750
It's based on fact, there's evidence to back it up.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.750
Thus true hope can come only from the one who has the power to fulfill whatever he promises, Jehovah God.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.750
Jehovah provides hope in abundance.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.750
Notice what Romans 1513 says about Jehovah.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.750
May the God who gives hope fill you with all joy and peace

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:02.750
by your trusting in him so that you may abound in hope with power of Holy Spirit.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.750
Yes, Jehovah gives us what we need to abound in hope.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.750
And yet the Apostle Paul also wrote as recorded at Colossians 1.23,

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.750
that a Christian could be shifted away from the hope.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.750
So we must never take our hope for granted. We need to feed it.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.750
What do you need to feed hope?

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:33.750
Two things are mentioned at Romans 154 for all the things that were written beforehand.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.750
We're written for our instruction so that through our endurance

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.750
and through the comfort from the scriptures we might have hope.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.750
So did you notice what feeds hope?

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.750
Our endurance and the comfort from the scriptures.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.750
The scriptures. What we take into our minds is vital to keeping our hope strong.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.750
For example, recall what happened shortly after Jesus was executed as recorded in Luke chapter 24.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.750
This is part of the conversation between an unidentified traveler and the disheartened disciples.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.750
The disciples were beside themselves with grief over Jesus' death.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.750
The traveler, though, was in fact the resurrected Jesus. The disciples didn't yet realize this.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.750
So they said, as recorded at Luke 24.21,

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.750
but we were hoping that this man was the one who was going to deliver Israel.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.750
Yes, and besides all these things, this is the third day since these things occurred.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.750
The scripture shows just how susceptible we can be to discouragement.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.750
When things don't turn out as we expect.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.750
But notice what Jesus did to help them.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.750
Verses 25 through 27.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.750
So he said to them,

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.750
Oh, senseless ones, and slow of heart to believe all the things the prophets have spoken.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.750
Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to enter into His glory?

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:19.750
And starting with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them things pertaining to himself in all the scriptures.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.750
So how did Jesus feed their hope?

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.750
First, by showing them that they were right to hope in the fulfillment of the scriptures.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.750
And then by teaching them how those scriptures had been fulfilled.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.750
Can we do the same today?

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.750
Yes. When we're facing challenges that threaten our hope,

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.750
we should ask Jehovah for guidance by means of His Holy Spirit.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.750
And then with the help of the publications of the faithful and discreet slave,

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.750
we should meditate carefully on how the scriptures are being fulfilled.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.750
It can be difficult to find time for this in these hectic days.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.750
There are so many claims on our attention, so many things to know and do.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:10.750
But what you take into your mind is vital to keeping your hope alive.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:17.750
The humanitarian crises facing mankind today could make any one of us feel anxious.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:26.750
Experts in fields of technology, finance, and government have found it necessary to coin new words to convey the gravity of the situation.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:33.750
In 2023, the word polycrisis began to soar in usage.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.750
A polycrisis refers to many global threats happening at the same time.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:46.750
The overlapping of health emergencies, climate change, wars, forced migrations, natural disasters,

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.750
and economic collapse all happening simultaneously.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:57.750
A polycrisis could throw a person off balance spiritually.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:11.750
But as students of Jesus sign of the last days, we have fully anticipated that there would be many serious problems facing mankind at the same time and on an unprecedented scale.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:19.750
But isn't it interesting that the world itself has seen fit to come up with an expression that adequately matches what we are going through?

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:26.750
Whether they realize it or not, they are acknowledging that Jesus' words are being fulfilled.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:41.750
So rather than become eaten up by anxiety, we can find hope in these very same facts, if we meditate on the fulfillment of the Scriptures.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:49.750
The Scriptures contain the promise of God, a promise of salvation.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.750
Jehovah God will bring to ruin those ruining the earth.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:59.750
There is going to be a resurrection. Death will be no more.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.750
The righteous will possess the earth, and they will live forever on it.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:11.750
Understanding how the Scriptures apply and how they're fulfilled builds our faith.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:25.750
The stronger our faith is, the stronger our hope will be, because faith is the assured, the assured expectation of what is hoped for.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.750
Do you think often about your hope?

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.750
Do you meditate on what it means?

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:40.750
First Thessalonians 5.8 says, let us put on the hope of salvation as a helmet.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:46.750
As a helmet protects the head, so hope protects the mind.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.750
Who of us does not need such a helmet?

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:58.750
Perhaps you have a favorite kingdom song or original song from JW.org that keeps Jehovah's promises shining brightly in your mind.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:05.750
When you recall that song, you're feeding your hope, which in turn guards your thinking.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:15.750
Our hope has to be so real to us that we can see ourselves in the new world no longer battling illness and depression,

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:25.750
but waking up each day with better hearing, better vision, better looks, better outlooks, no longer mourning the death of those we love,

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:30.750
but rather experiencing the thrill of seeing them come back to life.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:35.750
What's the longest lifespan you've ever heard of?

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.750
What's the greatest number you can think of?

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:43.750
Now combine the two concepts, living for...

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:52.750
Well, we could attempt to explain Googleplexes of galactic millenniums, but the fact is, no matter how great a period of time you can possibly fathom,

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:59.750
Jehovah promises us life that cannot be defined by any number because it never stops.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:06.750
That's what the Bible means by its many references to everlasting life.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:14.750
Visualize a project that would take several thousand years to plan and complete.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:18.750
What kind of forests would you like to grow?

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:28.750
Imagine having millions of years to observe, analyze and draw new conclusions from Jehovah's activities and creative works.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:38.750
What possibilities exist for an earth filled with loyal, loving people who cooperate with the many systems Jehovah has created?

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:45.750
What kind of knowledge would you like to acquire that is currently out of reach because of our limited lifespan?

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:52.750
What will it be like to build on the knowledge of hundreds of generations?

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:55.750
Picture whom you will meet in the resurrection.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:09:09.750
Yes, we think of family members and faithful ones of old, but consider what it will be like to understand how you are related to every person on this planet all the way back to the beginning.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:22.320
Imagine all intelligent creation in heaven and on earth united as one happy family praising Jehovah.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:30.320
Is this just wishful thinking? Happy thoughts? A dream? No. This is hope.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:44.320
It's meditation on the promise of God who cannot lie meditation on what he has done to fulfill his promise providing the ransom and establishing a heavenly kingdom that will bring mankind back to perfection.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:55.320
Meditation on Jehovah's personality. A personality revealed in his creative works in the scriptures and mirrored perfectly by his only begotten son.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:07.320
A personality we know, not only through deep study, but also through our own experience, and this leads us to the second way we feed our hope.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:18.320
Recall that Romans 154 said that there are two ways to feed your hope through the comfort from the scriptures, but also through our endurance.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:37.980
How does endurance feed your hope? Well, notice what Paul said about this back at Romans chapter 5 verses 3 through 5. Not only that, but let us rejoice while in tribulations.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:52.980
Since we know that tribulation produces endurance, endurance in turn, an approved condition, the approved condition in turn hope, and the hope does not lead to disappointment.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:11:01.980
Now the hope mentioned here is referring not to our initial hope. We already had that when we learned the promise of God contained in the scriptures.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:19.980
That's why Paul begins verse 3 with the words not only that. Yes, not only do we rejoice in our initial hope, but we rejoice in our reinforced hope, hope made even stronger through new experiences with Jehovah as our personal helper.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:26.980
Now the only way to understand this process fully is by going through it.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:54.980
What's been your experience? What have you done when undergoing tribulation? No doubt you turned to Jehovah for help, and then what happened? He helped you, true the trial might not have disappeared, but you discovered that you somehow had the strength to endure it, or the wisdom to manage it, or practical aid, or encouragement at just the right time,

00:11:54.980 --> 00:12:14.980
or the courage to continue bearing witness to the truth. How did you feel in that moment? Did you sense that Jehovah heard your prayer? Did you perceive Jehovah reassuring you that you and he have a relationship?

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:34.980
When you go through that, even once, you no longer wonder whether you could endure a crisis. You know you can with Jehovah's help. That is hope, not simply a desire for something good, but the basis for believing it will happen.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:57.980
Many of our dear brothers and sisters have built up a lifetime of such experiences. That's why their hope hasn't weakened despite waiting for the new world for decades. To the contrary, their hope has been strengthened through experience. They know firsthand what Romans 5-3-5 is talking about, and likely you do as well.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:26.980
Thank God for hope. Jehovah is the God who gives hope. May we never become shifted away from our hope. When difficulties arise, feed your hope. Continue to meditate on the comfort from the scriptures. Keep trusting in Jehovah for strength and wisdom, and each day take note of how he reassures you that hope, your hope.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.980
Is real.
