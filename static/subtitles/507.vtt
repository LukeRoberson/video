00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.290
Most of us have been attending meetings for years,

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.330
some decades, others for our entire life.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.730
But isn't it good to stop and pause from time to time

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.529
and think to ourselves and ask ourselves,

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:18.170
why am I attending meetings?

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.570
It seems like such a simple, basic question,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.850
but how profound because it has huge meaning for us.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.530
It really shows our motives inside and it shows our goals.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.609
It affects our relationship with Jehovah as well as others.

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:38.329
Our Watchtower article under consideration for today

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.490
is entitled, why should we meet together for worship?

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.210
So there's our clue for worship.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.329
And the Watchtower article featured a box entitled,

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.450
Reasons to a Ten Meetings.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.609
As shown on the monitor, the box listed eight reasons.

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:59.609
And they were grouped into three basic categories.

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.369
The first, how you are personally affected.

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:07.329
So we receive education at the meetings, encouragement.

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:10.689
They bring us closer to Jehovah through his Holy Spirit

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:13.329
and we can tap into that powerful spirit.

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:16.930
The second area is how others are affected.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.609
So we can give, we have an opportunity to show

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:21.489
our brothers and sisters that we love them

00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:23.450
and we want to encourage them.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.730
And the last category is how Jehovah is affected.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.250
As we go to the meetings

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.090
and we have good meeting attendance,

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.890
it really gives us an opportunity to give Jehovah

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.129
what he deserves, our heartfelt praise, our worship.

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:38.689
It shows Jehovah that we want to draw close to him

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.010
and his son Jesus.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.609
And lastly, it demonstrates that we support God's sovereignty.

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:47.930
Now this is the way the Watchtower listed these subjects,

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.010
these categories.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.930
But if you were to rearrange these,

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.260
how would you put these in order of importance?

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.019
Isn't it true that worshiping Jehovah

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:02.819
is the most important reason why we go to the Kingdom Hall?

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:04.140
These other reasons are good.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.180
We benefit, others benefit.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.180
But as we meditate and we stop and think,

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.659
is meetings, are meetings a priority in my life?

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.780
Even if we're tired, even if we're full of anxiety

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.060
or we're going through some difficult times,

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.580
we need to stop, think and meditate

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.539
on why we go to meetings.

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:28.060
It's to worship Jehovah.

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:33.259
And that's exactly what the composer of Psalm 116 did.

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:35.460
He paused, he stopped,

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.219
and he thought about his relationship with Jehovah

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:42.340
and what he could do to serve Jehovah more in the future.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.699
He saw how Jehovah helped him through difficult times

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:48.300
as well as the good times.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.819
He took this time in Psalm 116 to reflect on

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.500
all that Jehovah did for him.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.539
And it's good for us to do the same.

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:58.259
So please open your Bibles, your tablets with me

00:02:58.259 --> 00:03:00.419
to Psalm 116.

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:03.419
And as we find that Psalm,

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:05.860
we will see that the Psalmist

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.580
really tells us some wonderful things about Jehovah

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.180
and how we can cope with our issues.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.020
We see here this Psalm is referred to

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.860
as a song of gratitude.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.620
And we see this right away in verse one

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.500
where the Psalmist says,

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.419
makes this thankful, sane,

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:26.219
this expression of gratitude.

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:29.259
I love Jehovah.

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:31.180
Well, there's many reasons why he loved Jehovah,

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.819
but he starts up by saying,

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.860
because he hears my voice, my pleas for help.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.979
And verse two, he inclines his ear to me.

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:41.259
And the footnote says,

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:43.979
or he bends down to listen.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.939
Now, just because the Psalmist

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:48.780
had this relationship with Jehovah,

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.259
he loved Jehovah.

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:53.259
It did not mean that his life was carefree,

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:55.860
that it was stress free, that he had an easy life.

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.259
And by no means, in fact, it's quite the opposite.

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:03.060
He had many problems, and he had many trials.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.539
And many of us can relate to some of the things

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:07.979
that we'll be reading in Psalm 116,

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:09.979
what this Psalmist went through.

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:11.379
Notice there in verse three.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.900
It said that he faced death.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.259
Well, if we were to face death,

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:18.259
we would feel the same way as a Psalmist.

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:19.860
It caused him distress.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.259
It caused him grief.

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:25.259
There in verse six, he was brought low.

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:29.339
Well, this could mean that he felt downhearted, weak,

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:31.980
depressed, whatever circumstances he was in.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.540
This is how he felt.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.420
Verse 10 and 11, he said he was greatly afflicted.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.779
This caused him to panic, to become anxious.

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:45.540
Now, although he was going through some difficult times,

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.579
he had these trials, he made a vow to Jehovah.

00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:51.339
He promised him in verses two and four,

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:54.300
to call on Jehovah, to give him the praise

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.060
that he deserves, to rely on him in prayer.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.180
And he would do this for how long?

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.540
For as long as he lived.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.779
And this is just what he did.

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:07.699
And as the Psalmist reflected on all that Jehovah

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:11.019
has done for his loyal servants in the past,

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:14.019
as well as what he has done for the Psalmist himself,

00:05:14.019 --> 00:05:17.459
it really helped him to come to the conclusion in verse five

00:05:17.459 --> 00:05:21.300
that the God that he worships is one that is compassionate,

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.139
one that is righteous, one that is merciful.

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:26.660
And in verses six through eight,

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.660
we'll notice that Jehovah in the eyes of the Psalmist

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.980
is viewed as a trusted guardian,

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.860
savior, rescuer, a kind and compassionate father

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.019
who always provides comfort and guidance to his children.

00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:46.740
And all of this, this love, this attachment to Jehovah,

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.459
what did it do for the Psalmist?

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:50.259
Notice there in verse 10,

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.819
that strong love gave him strong faith.

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:56.180
It gave him the confidence to speak up

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.779
and to praise his God.

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:01.939
His problems did not disappear,

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:03.540
but neither did Jehovah.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.220
Jehovah was always there to back him,

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.500
to give him the comfort and to help him endure,

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.660
to never give up.

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:13.699
Now after meditating on all the ways

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:16.019
that Jehovah cared for him over the years,

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:18.220
the Psalmist asked himself a question,

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.740
maybe it's a question we need to ask from time to time.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.899
In verse 12, with what will I repay Jehovah

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:30.779
for all the good he has done for me personally?

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:33.420
So we thought about that, he pondered,

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.139
and what was the conclusion?

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:36.699
Notice verse 17.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.740
He said, I will offer to you, Jehovah,

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.899
the sacrifice of Thanksgiving.

00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:45.740
I will call in the name of Jehovah.

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:48.620
I will pay my vows to Jehovah in the presence

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.860
of all his people in the courtyards

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.180
of the house of Jehovah in your midst, O Jerusalem.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.980
Praise, jaw.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.379
So we can see the determination in the Psalmist,

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:05.259
his closeness to Jehovah, Jehovah inclined his ear

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:07.180
to listen to him, to help him.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.019
Well, this really strengthened the bond

00:07:10.019 --> 00:07:12.579
between the Psalmist and Jehovah.

00:07:12.579 --> 00:07:15.139
He was resolved to do his best

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:17.220
to give thanks back to Jehovah

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.939
and live up to his promises and his vows.

00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:22.740
It was his desire.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.019
It was his goal to always praise Jehovah

00:07:26.019 --> 00:07:27.980
and we would do this for rest of his life

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.220
and where would he do this in the house of Jehovah?

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.259
And who would he worship in the house of Jehovah with

00:07:34.259 --> 00:07:36.540
with all of Jehovah's people?

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.660
So we see a pattern for us today.

00:07:39.819 --> 00:07:44.660
How can we possibly pay or repay Jehovah?

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.139
How can we show our appreciation for all the provisions,

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:50.980
all that he has done for us?

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:54.660
Well, we can never fully repay Jehovah, that's impossible.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:59.740
But what we can do is show him our love and our appreciation.

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.819
We can live up to our dedication every day.

00:08:02.819 --> 00:08:05.779
We can give back to Jehovah praise every week

00:08:05.779 --> 00:08:08.060
at our meetings and in the ministry

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.939
and doing so with our brothers and our sisters.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.740
We can also show appreciation for the many provisions

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:19.500
that are available to Jehovah's organization today,

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.300
like our revised Bible.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.540
What a treasure that is for us.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.300
And then we have the study Bible

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.500
with all those study notes, the videos, the pictures,

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.139
the charts, all of these helping us visual people

00:08:32.139 --> 00:08:36.059
to understand what Jehovah's righteous ways are,

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:39.419
well, how he wants to us to act and serve him.

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:43.019
We also have the many printed publications.

00:08:43.019 --> 00:08:46.580
We have JW.org, JW Broadcasting,

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.740
and the beautiful music and videos

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:52.700
that are being produced for our benefit today.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.179
Now these provisions will help strengthen

00:08:55.179 --> 00:08:57.740
our love for Jehovah and keep Jehovah

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.179
as the number one thing in our life.

00:09:01.179 --> 00:09:05.299
But to fully benefit from all of these provisions,

00:09:05.299 --> 00:09:07.620
what is needed on our part?

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.980
Well, first of all, we need to be acquainted

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.580
with what is available.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.980
We need to learn how to use them

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.179
and then we need to take the time, slow down

00:09:17.179 --> 00:09:20.100
and use these tools to our benefit,

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.740
to the worship of Jehovah and benefit others.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:28.059
Now, thinking about it just a really simple illustration.

00:09:28.059 --> 00:09:29.700
Many of us have a phone,

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.940
some of us have these things called smartphones,

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.700
you need to be smart to even use these smartphones.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.340
But it takes time, it takes effort

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.460
to learn all the different features on these phones.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:43.019
They can take pictures, videos, we can study on these,

00:09:43.019 --> 00:09:44.620
we can go on to the internet,

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.820
we can do all kinds of wonderful things.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:50.100
We could talk to our families through Skype

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.740
or different means.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:56.100
We can talk, use it as a phone, how amazing.

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.899
But with all these things, what is needed on our part?

00:10:00.899 --> 00:10:04.779
First of all, we need to understand how to use it, right?

00:10:04.779 --> 00:10:07.740
And this phone or some of these tablets

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:12.460
would never work if we would not plug it in to a power source.

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:16.220
It has to be charged in order to be useful to us.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.779
And isn't that the same when we think about what we need

00:10:19.779 --> 00:10:21.139
to do for Jehovah?

00:10:21.139 --> 00:10:22.620
We need to be at the meetings,

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.179
we need to understand what he wants us to do

00:10:25.179 --> 00:10:27.980
to work in accord with his will, his purposes.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.820
But we also need to plug ourselves into his power

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:32.100
for Holy Spirit.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.259
And if we do that, we will be able to give Jehovah

00:10:35.259 --> 00:10:38.460
the worship he deserves, we will benefit,

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.940
and then we will be beneficial to others.
