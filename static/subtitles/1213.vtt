00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:10.300
Before I came into the truth, my life was difficult. We were many women with one husband. My child had died.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.300
I got the truth through one older sister.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.300
She helped me understand what happens to people that day, including my son.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.300
I started attending the book study and came into the truth.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.299
During the course of the study, I learned that to really serve Jehovah, you cannot be part of a polygamous marriage.

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:38.299
So I told him, staying in this situation is not in line with Jehovah's way.

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:43.299
I have to leave. You already had a wife when I came to your house.

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:49.299
So he said, how can you talk about leaving when you are pregnant with my child?

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:57.299
The whole family needs to be involved in this. My family said, you have to call a village meeting so they called everyone together.

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:02.299
Everybody was upset with me. They said, but no one has done this before.

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:08.299
You are the first. I said, it is not bad. I want to serve God. They gossiped a lot about me.

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.299
They said, you are leaving, but you come back. You can't make it on your own. Just forget about her.

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.299
So when I was leaving that day, I couldn't stop crying.

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:28.299
Since my family shan't me, keeping in mind Joshua 24-15, I said, me and my children will serve Jehovah.

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.299
And Jehovah will be with me wherever I go.

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:40.299
I only packed a few personal items that I had. I left everything that was in the house. I left everything with them.

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:53.959
I was affected by the war because while I was running away, one of my children got sick in my hands and died on the road.

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.549
I had a basket for fishing that I bought. When fishing, I would sell some.

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:13.550
Whatever I did in sell, we ate. Sometimes I would ask my daughter, we are so poor Zogo, don't you want to go back to the village? She said, mama, I can't go back. I want to serve Jehovah too.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.550
Jehovah blessed me. My daughter Zogbo got baptized and later served at Bethel.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:28.550
Jehovah also blessed me when I got married. Our son is now an unbublished publisher and my husband is an elder.

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:37.539
First piece of three one helped me to improve my conduct. It helped my first husband to serve Jehovah too.

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:54.539
I have no regrets. I am now happy with my decision. I told Jehovah, thank you. That is why no matter what it takes, I don't want to miss meetings. I always want to attend meetings with my brothers and sisters so that we can encourage one another.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:09.840
I accepted the truth before my husband. His family members opposed me because I helped my husband to become a witness.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:18.840
That is why they never came to our aid when he was sick. My children and I took care of him on our own until his death.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:30.840
The chief asked me to perform some funeral rites. I explained that I could not perform those rites, so the chief banished me from the town along with my family.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:39.840
So I informed the elders and they consulted the branch. The case was reported to the police.

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:56.539
One Tuesday morning, we had a lot of noise coming from town, but did not know why. Soon the noise got louder, coming towards us.

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:05.289
As a commotion reached us, my sister-in-law approached first, beating a tray with wood.

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:14.289
She then told me to my face. Agnes, you have caused disgrace. We have never heard anything like this before.

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:27.819
Disgrace. Soon thereafter, we had a knock-knock. Two policemen had arrived. I couldn't flee from the situation because my fellow worshipers would face the same issue in the future.

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:34.259
Therefore, I decided to stay and face it until the case was resolved.

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:45.500
When our case was called up, my family members and I were present. I was allowed to tell my vision of the matter, which I did.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:53.500
The inspector warned the chief seriously, reminding him that this matter is about an individual's human rights.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.500
The chief responded, okay, then she should not exchange greetings with me until my death.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.500
I thanked the officers and the chief for resolving the matter.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:17.500
What helped me to stand firm during the persecution was regular Bible reading, regularly attending Christian meetings and completely relying on Jehovah.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:26.230
There are not many in the congregation who stay in town, but we have brothers from surrounding villages.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:32.230
Who, when they come to the meetings in town, come visit to encourage me after the meetings.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:41.230
Jehovah said that they will certainly fight against you, but they will not prevail against you, for I am with you.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:51.230
Since Jehovah was on my side, when they fought against me, they did not prevail. With Jehovah's help, they did not prevail.
