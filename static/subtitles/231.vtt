00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:08.710
No doubt you have heard that the peaceful worship of Jehovah's Witnesses is under attack in Russia.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:17.710
Just one week ago, on March 15, the Russian Ministry of Justice filed a claim with the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation,

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:27.710
seeking to declare our religious organization as extremist or criminal in nature and ban our activity.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.710
The Supreme Court is scheduled to consider the claim on Wednesday, April 5.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:45.710
Even though their decision is pending, already the Ministry of Justice has issued a suspension notice with the aim of shutting down many of our branch activities.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:59.710
As you can imagine, a decision by the Supreme Court in favor of this claim will have dire consequences for more than 170,000 of our brothers in Russia.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.709
Of course, there are thousands more who are associated with our organization.

00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:16.709
For example, it is quite likely that our branch office near St. Petersburg and Kingdom Halls throughout the country will be seized by the Russian government.

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:31.709
In addition, the possibility exists that our brothers could be criminally prosecuted for meeting together for worship, for sharing their faith with others, or even for reading the Bible together.

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:39.709
Sadly, Russia's federal law on extremist activity is being misapplied to Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:44.709
Around the world, we are politically neutral.

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:50.709
We are known as peace-loving citizens who abhor violence and warfare.

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:58.709
Under no circumstances would we ever resort to any extremist or criminal activity.

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:10.710
Even so, our Lord Jesus Christ warned that true Christians would be hated and would face opposition and outright persecution.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:17.710
Do you recall what Jesus said at John 15 verses 18 to 20?

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:24.710
If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.710
If you were part of the world, the world would be fond of what is its own.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:39.710
Now, because you are no part of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world for this reason the world hates you.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:45.710
Keep in mind the word I said to you, a slave is not greater than his master.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.710
If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:56.710
If they have observed my word, they will also observe yours.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:03.710
No one wishes to be persecuted, but we are not surprised by what is taking place in Russia.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:09.710
As you know, Jesus was the object of bitter persecution.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:16.710
His well-known words recorded at John chapter 16 verse 33 still comfort us.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:25.710
In the world, you will have tribulation, but take courage I have conquered the world.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:32.710
The Apostle Paul was no stranger to persecution and the associated suffering.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.710
At 2 Timothy chapter 3 and verse 11, he said,

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:43.710
I endured these persecutions and the Lord rescued me from them all.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:50.710
If Jesus and Paul conquered despite persecution, we can too.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:58.710
Jehovah fully supports those being persecuted for righteousness and cares for their daily needs.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:04.710
What can we personally do to support our brothers and sisters in Russia?

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:10.710
First and foremost, we should pray earnestly in their behalf.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:17.709
Additionally, all congregations are being invited to share in a letter writing campaign

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:26.709
so that government officials and others of high rank will know how we personally feel about this great injustice.

00:04:26.709 --> 00:04:32.709
You will find more information in the newsroom section of JW.org.

00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:37.709
Despite the challenges being faced by our brothers in Russia,

00:04:37.709 --> 00:04:46.709
we are confident that Jehovah will continue to support them and that they will maintain their integrity.

00:04:46.709 --> 00:04:53.709
As expressed by the Apostle Paul at Romans chapter 8 verses 38 and 39,

00:04:53.709 --> 00:05:08.709
we are convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor governments nor things now here nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other creation

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:15.709
will be able to separate us from God's love that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:22.709
Now we would like to direct some comments to our brothers and sisters in Russia, in Russian.

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:27.709
I am a great honor to welcome you from the hands of the Holy Spirit.

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:33.709
We are glad to offer you love and patience.

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:39.709
Our pleasure is that you now belong to Russia.

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:46.709
This is a sign that you will surely remember the part you have been through Jesus.

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:56.709
In the first chapter 3 and 14, the Apostle Peter said,

00:05:57.709 --> 00:06:03.709
But even if the Apostle gives you the right to be part of it,

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:09.709
and that you are afraid of it, they are not afraid of it and they are not afraid of it.

00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:17.709
Of course, we, as the Holy Spirit, will not be able to do everything that is in our power,

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:23.709
so that you have peace and peace in your service of Jehovah.

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:32.709
However, it is possible that you will need to continue to worship God in such a difficult circumstances.

00:06:32.709 --> 00:06:35.709
What do you do?

00:06:35.709 --> 00:06:39.709
Continue to develop a strong spirit of Jehovah.

00:06:39.709 --> 00:06:46.709
Read the Bible every day and pray for the Holy Spirit.

00:06:46.709 --> 00:06:53.709
This will be your faith and it will help you to stand in the difficult circumstances.

00:06:53.709 --> 00:07:02.709
While you are struggling to save your faith and your Christian family,

00:07:02.709 --> 00:07:11.709
Jehovah will continue to support you and strengthen your own strong spirit.

00:07:12.709 --> 00:07:18.709
You will not be able to stand in your heart in prayer.

00:07:18.709 --> 00:07:21.709
He is always close to you.

00:07:21.709 --> 00:07:26.709
How He saves us in Isaiah 41-10?

00:07:26.709 --> 00:07:30.709
Don't be afraid, because I am with you.

00:07:30.709 --> 00:07:38.709
Don't be afraid, because I am your God, because I will protect you.

00:07:38.709 --> 00:07:45.709
I will be strong and strong in your right hand.

00:07:45.709 --> 00:07:58.709
The Holy Spirit will support you and strengthen your faith that you will be able to do everything you want.

00:07:58.709 --> 00:08:04.709
It may seem that nothing like this could happen in the country where you live.

00:08:04.709 --> 00:08:10.709
However, all of us should seriously reflect on the times in which we live.

00:08:10.709 --> 00:08:16.709
The relative stability we may currently experience could change very quickly.

00:08:16.709 --> 00:08:23.709
While the conditions of this world rapidly deteriorate and with the great tribulations so near at hand,

00:08:23.709 --> 00:08:27.709
we must prove ourselves ready.

00:08:27.709 --> 00:08:33.710
Thus may all of us meditate on our timely year text at Psalm 37-3.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:38.710
Trust in Jehovah and do what is good.

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:47.710
Brothers and sisters, we look to Jehovah with full faith and we are confident that His blessing will be with you.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:49.710
We love all of you very much.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:55.710
