00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:13.900
For joy are like riches increasing in worth

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.899
Those precious to God from all nations

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:21.899
Are joining us in all the earth

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:23.899
The joy in our hardest moment

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:28.309
First reaching deep in God's word

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:32.310
We daily partake of new secrets

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.310
It follows the things we have heard

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.310
Our causes for joy are deep-seated

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.310
Like ambers that burn in up

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.850
The troubles and trials be set us

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.850
Endurance shall hold by impart

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.850
Shall hold by our cause

00:00:50.850 --> 00:01:21.250
Let's see and the love this has

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:33.260
Try up and give me a sweet spread

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:39.090
All abroad, rejoicing abroad
