00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.990
Good morning, class.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.990
As we delve deeper into chapter four,

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.109
we're gonna see why we know

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.429
that evolution is a fact.

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.869
Now, when we think about the word evolution,

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:16.030
what comes to mind?

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.309
Your grades are some of the highest in the class.

00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:20.910
I have these both shores.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.329
They're both really fine schools,

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:24.309
but this one in particular on top

00:00:24.309 --> 00:00:26.390
is the one I would really like you to consider.

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.429
Rebecca, you're one of our fastest runners.

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:47.070
I really want you to consider trying out for the team.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.310
I feel so confused.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.429
I know some things they teach at school

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:54.070
don't agree with the Bible,

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.950
but sometimes they just seem to make sense.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.590
Then there's the pressure to join sports

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:09.040
and what to do with my future.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.040
I finally told Mom some of the challenges I was having.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.359
She really listened and admitted struggling

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:19.159
with some of the same issues when she was younger.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.400
Then she shared Hebrews 5, 13 and 14.

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:26.920
For everyone who continues to feed on milk

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.760
is unequainted with the word of righteousness

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.799
for he is a young child,

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.799
but solid food belongs to mature people.

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.560
To those who through use have their powers of discernment

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.280
trained to distinguish both right and wrong.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.719
She said when her personal study went beyond the surface

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.359
on questions and issues that bothered her,

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:52.760
she began to discover truly meaningful answers

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.280
that built up her faith and helped her make good decisions.

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:00.120
It helped her to go from just feeling it was the truth

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.959
to knowing it.
