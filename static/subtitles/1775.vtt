00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:25.719
So a summer time, a group of brothers and sisters, we made arrangements to join the vacation

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:33.119
time to go to the beach and so during that time, I came into the beaches where I met her.

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:37.329
I hadn't met her sisters but I had not met her.

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:43.850
My grandparents and my aunt were a very important part in raising me and my sisters.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.450
They learned the truth first in Ecuador and we always lived close by.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.929
I always went to visit them and they helped my parents in guiding me into the truth.

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:01.850
So first three or four years of our marriage, we were about an hour and a half away from

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:02.850
my family.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.090
That was really hard on me because close to my sister so it was kind of hard being so

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.849
to me that was really far.

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:16.329
I knew early on that one of the most important things that I needed in the main is someone

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:18.010
who loves Jehovah.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.049
And they always say, I remember my parents and the meeting always say, find someone who

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.780
loves Jehovah more than it loves you and it's easy to say that.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.180
But as you find someone you realize, she loves Jehovah more than she loves me and she

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.099
has demonstrated through her entire marriage when it comes Jehovah is first.

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:42.200
I think that is the key for a successful marriage.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.359
I think the biggest challenge we went through in our marriage was our first year in the

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:46.359
circuit work.

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:52.200
Hard enough moving 3,000 miles away from everyone, starting a new type of life.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.439
Two months later my grandfather dies, six months right after that my mother dies.

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:05.019
After her mom dies, my mom passed away with this one right after the other.

00:02:05.019 --> 00:02:10.590
That was a difficult time for us.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.189
All the pain and suffering from losing our moms and loved ones.

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:25.699
Every time we felt that we were not continuing, it was overwhelming.

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:32.539
The period of time was eight months and ten days between the death of Mimi's mom and

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:42.560
my mom.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.280
A three-fold chord is the routine in which Jehovah is included in the marriage from reading

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:55.439
the Bible together, to going in the ministry together, to doing everyday things together.

00:02:55.439 --> 00:03:00.120
And as you do this, Jehovah is present in your marriage.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.039
We always think that it's our Bible reading, actually we don't think we realize our Bible

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:06.759
reading is very important for us.

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:13.840
We pick a book, we start reading it and we know that is what keeps us together.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.439
We were both already pioneering before we got married and as we got married we just

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:23.439
figured out a way to continue pioneering together.

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:27.439
Just make sure to start our spiritual careers together.

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:33.240
So we have to always depend on Jehovah, which is the best person to always depend on.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.280
We spend a lot of time by ourselves driving from city to city, from state to state and we

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.840
had plenty of time to reflect, to talk, to draw close to each other, to not only rely

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:54.039
on Jehovah, but also be closer between us and spend more time talking about the visit,

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:57.840
talking about the friends, talking about how we feel.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.840
I think it was at the end it was the toughest assignment, but it was the most rewarding

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.360
of all the assignments we had had in all these years and the childhood work.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.039
Because it's three of us and Jehovah is an equal part in our marriage, it doesn't matter

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:17.839
what we go through, whether it be Peter or I that's having a little bit of a struggle

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:22.040
because Jehovah is there, it's going to keep us united and strong.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:28.639
And also it's not just in the things we do while we worship, yes we worship together,

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.040
but it's also all the other things that we do to Jehovah's way.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:38.040
We're best friends and we enjoy spending time together outside of service and the meetings.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.040
We like doing fun things outside, we like the outdoors.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.579
When we're facing a difficult challenge, we will go to Jehovah and pray together specifically

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:51.579
to Jehovah help us with this challenge.

00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:56.579
Our assignments have helped us to always be with each other because we have the same goals in mind.

00:04:56.579 --> 00:05:01.579
We're working together for the same purpose, so the same schedule.

00:05:01.579 --> 00:05:08.579
Spiritual schedule has really helped us to go through these challenging periods in our life.

00:05:08.579 --> 00:05:13.579
But knowing that Jehovah is our creator, the sovereign being,

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:15.579
he's the one who should tell us what to do.

00:05:15.579 --> 00:05:23.269
And there is an arrangement and when you follow his arrangement, there's happiness, there's success.

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:30.269
We're in an imperfect world, but his arrangement works and we have felt it.
