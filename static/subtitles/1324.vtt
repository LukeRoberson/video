00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:10.550
This past summer, it was my privilege to attend a large regional convention in Stockholm, Sweden.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:20.550
Brothers and sisters from Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and also the Swedish Circuit in Finland,

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.550
were present at this historic convention.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:37.549
While this event was a great spiritual boost for the witnesses, some of you may know that the majority of the local residents do not believe in God.

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:50.549
Many consider themselves atheists, but the conduct and professionalism of Jehovah's people made a great impact.

00:00:51.549 --> 00:01:10.790
First, the branch offices were emerged, and the result was a new branch office, Scandinavia branch.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:20.519
We thought that if all the brothers in Scandinavia should benefit from this unity, then we had to have a convention in Stockholm.

00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:29.909
Here we were allowed to arrange a regional convention, but one of enormous size.

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:39.909
Having 50,000 brothers gathered together for three days is the largest bureaucratic event ever in Scandinavia.

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.909
So we began to look for a facility, and we found friends arena.

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:56.459
I think we have had a very good collaboration.

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:09.759
Many times I have thought, wow, these people working for you as the organizers of infrastructure, logistics, and so on, we should work with them more often.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.759
The use of technology has been the greatest challenge.

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:17.759
Obviously, with such a last project, many details have to come together.

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:23.759
There are four languages and three sign languages, and all this have to be tied together and worked at the same time.

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:26.759
It has been a challenge, but we made it work.

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:33.759
All the experts argued that it would be impossible to have four languages at one arena.

00:02:33.759 --> 00:03:12.360
Families with children and strollers arrived.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:19.360
Some elderly publishers get up at 5.30 or 6am, getting on the bus to be here in good time.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:26.360
Jehovah must be joyful seeing all the people appreciating the spiritual program and all their efforts.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:43.830
When the song started, 50,000 were in place here, and it was our proof that all the hard work and preparation was successful.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.830
And actually, I shared a tear of joy. I did.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:04:00.180
One of the managers at the arena said, you have to stand and listen to the song, because you will never again hear a choir of 50,000 singing at the same time.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.180
You just have to listen to it.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:14.780
First, I want to thank you for how well it worked out.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.779
Normally, at arrangements of this size, we are using an event agency.

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:25.779
But you've done this for many years, and you've done a fantastic job, so it wasn't needed.

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:30.779
You've been very professional and have knowledge of the business industry.

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:39.779
I've told the contact persons I've been involved with that they should start up an event agency because it has worked out so smoothly.

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:45.610
I can warmly recommend other cities to welcome you.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:52.610
You have been very well organized, and we have not had to put much effort into the arrangement.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.610
It requires a good organization to get all things to fall into place.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:06.610
Obviously, having so many tourists in Stockholm at the same time benefits the whole city.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.610
I looked at the number of hotel bookings, and there are not many rooms available.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:18.610
There are many who can learn from the work of the logistics of how to get 50,000 people into the area at the same time.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.339
That is something we can learn a lot from.

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:31.339
We met with the police this afternoon, and they said that they have never seen such a well organized event ever.

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:45.670
Seeing how everything has been successful, that is a clear evidence of Jehovah's help.

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.670
It is a great confirmation of one's faith.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.670
Here you really see faith in action.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.670
Here you see the foundation for a new and better world.
