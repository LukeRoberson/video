00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:18.879
Early one morning, armed Russian special forces broke into my home.

00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:23.760
They handcuffed me and searched my place.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.839
They took me to the FSB office for interrogation.

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:35.340
Two days later, the court sentenced me to pre-trial detention.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.659
I was scared because I didn't know how I would be treated in prison.

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:44.060
Threatening that things would get worse for me, the officer demanded that I incriminate

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.179
myself, admit guilt, and give the names of my fellow believers.

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:51.820
I also really missed my dear wife.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.299
It was so hard without her.

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:59.140
For two months, I didn't have any spiritual food or a Bible.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.899
So I decided to make one.

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:08.540
My wife sent me a notebook and every day I wrote down verses that I was able to remember.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.980
After I had written about 500 verses, I was given a Bible.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.859
Because I was so spiritually hungry, I read it through in four months.

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:22.180
During this time, I wrote letters to my wife and friends and shared interesting things

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.900
that I learned from my reading.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.060
But the letters I received from my friends and my dear wife gave me the feeling that the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.659
brothers and sisters were so close to me, as if they were in the cells next to me.

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.180
I wasn't lonely.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.409
I felt as if my friends were right there with me.

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.250
Every trial detention isolates a person from society.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.170
But it's impossible to isolate someone from Jehovah.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.609
Throughout the day, I prayed to Jehovah many times, but I especially waited for bad time.

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:00.810
When everyone wasn't bad and only the nightlight was on, I could talk to Jehovah as much as

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.810
I wanted.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.209
There were times when I was all alone in the cell.

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:09.370
And of course, I took advantage of the situation.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:17.009
I would get down on my knees and would literally cry as I prayed to Jehovah.

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:22.449
I decided to write my requests to God on a sheet of paper and then mark off the ones that

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:23.530
he answered.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.090
I was convinced that Jehovah was very close to me.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.770
I also quietly sang our songs throughout the day.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.250
But when I was all alone, I sang at the top of my voice.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.650
I also tried to give a witness whenever possible.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:46.210
We discussed a variety of topics, everything from tattoos to the King of the North.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.330
All my fears and anxieties were for nothing.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:56.610
I was in detention 343 days and not even a hair fell from my head.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.330
This was the most interesting year of my life, an excellent school to help refine my spiritual

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.650
qualities.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.969
I have never felt so close to Jehovah.

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:10.009
What a great honor to uphold God's sovereignty in this way.
