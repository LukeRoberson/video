00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:18.420
In a land where national and religious hostilities have divided people for decades, a striking

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.989
display of multinational unity unfolded in Tel Aviv, Israel last summer.

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:31.429
A unique group of Israelis and Palestinians came together, along with hundreds from other

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:37.750
countries around the world, for a special convention of Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.670
With delegates from both Israel and the Palestinian territory, as well as the United States,

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.390
Italy and Greece, this convention had to be presented on four different stages and

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.990
in five languages simultaneously.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:01:01.869
Every talk and demonstration was presented in Hebrew, English, Russian, Arabic and Israeli

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:04.469
sign language.

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:11.189
This allowed the nearly 4,000 in attendance to learn, worship and sing together, all while

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.549
enjoying the program in their own language.

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:21.189
Hebrew-speaking delegates were particularly excited when, on the very first day of the

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:26.310
convention, Stephen Lett, a member of the governing body, announced the release of the New World

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:44.629
Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures in Hebrew.

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:49.790
Brother Lett took advantage of the time available during each afternoon's lunch period to give

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:56.790
a special talk of encouragement to each of the language groups attending the convention.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:20.520
As this convention grew to a close, it was clear to all those in attendance that the love

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:27.280
among Jehovah's people transcends national and ethnic boundaries and even transcends language

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.439
itself.

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:36.560
It left every delegate with a deeper appreciation of the love and unity that bonds all of Jehovah's

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.639
people together around the world.
