00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:07.440
This month, I'd like to talk about the efforts Jehovah's Organization is making to produce

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.419
the literature, publications, articles that are as accurate as possible.

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:18.500
We're going to talk about accuracy, accuracy of statement.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.899
Now, first, what's the responsibility of the writer of the article?

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:30.699
When a writer submits an article for publication, he is expected to supply references from

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.299
reputable sources to back up the facts that he's included in his article.

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:41.740
And our research department will use those references to check the accuracy of everything.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.539
Reliable, respected sources.

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.219
What do we mean by a reliable source?

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:56.659
Well, first of all, we go with encyclopedias, books, magazines, and then newspapers, basically

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:58.259
in that order.

00:00:58.259 --> 00:01:06.019
We prefer encyclopedias over books, books over magazines, and magazines over newspapers,

00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:09.819
generally because newspaper editors have a hard time checking their facts, they have

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:13.739
a very limited time in which to check their facts.

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:19.099
So even encyclopedias, though, and books get updated, so we have to go with the latest

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:21.180
edition of those.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.060
We have to make sure that our sources are reliable.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.780
Now when a writer quotes an expert, our researchers will ask, who's this expert?

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.700
What's his reputation?

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.140
Is he working for a particular organization?

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.099
Does this organization have an agenda?

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:42.260
Is that a special interest group?

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.379
If we find that the goals of the organization are questionable, we won't use the quote,

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:51.900
even if it's a really good quote.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.379
Now suppose that a writer wants to quote something from a book.

00:01:56.379 --> 00:02:01.659
In the reference material, he'll supply a photocopy of the quote in the book, but very

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.099
often he'll give us two or three pages before the quote and two or three pages after as

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:08.099
well.

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.699
And that way, our researchers can examine the quote in context to make sure that what

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:19.139
we're saying in print is really what the author of the quote had in mind.

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:25.699
For example, an evolutionist might make a statement which on the surface appears to confirm

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:31.819
his supportive creation, or perhaps an atheist will make a statement that seems to indicate

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.979
that he believes in God.

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:38.099
But when you examine the quote in context, you realize that that isn't what the author

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.300
had in mind at all.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.419
We would never deliberately distort a quotation.

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:49.419
We try very hard to use all of our quotations in context.

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:55.419
Now, it's important to keep up with the very latest research, something that was stated

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:58.580
years ago as a fact may have been disproved.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:05.379
And the reason why is obvious, someone may spend his entire life researching a very limited

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.699
point in history, a very small point in history.

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:12.699
And of course, if he spends so much time researching, he's going to uncover things.

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:17.460
And so it's not surprising that from time to time, we have to adjust our view of some

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.500
historical points.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.060
We have to check, check, check.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.219
And later on in this discussion, we're going to consider some examples of it.

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:27.219
It'll be fun.

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:29.060
You'll love it.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:37.139
Now someone might ask, why is it necessary to be so picky, to be so fussy about accuracy?

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:42.460
And an answer I like to give an experience that I heard about a few years ago.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:48.060
In Northern Europe, there was a man who accepted a Bible study from Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.460
And when he was asked what motivated him to want to study, he said, I read an article in

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.219
your awake magazine on trees.

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:59.500
Now I happen to be a bit of an expert on trees.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.939
And after I read the article, I said to myself, that article was so well documented.

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:08.180
It was so precise.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.300
Any organization that is that careful when writing about trees is going to be just as

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.699
careful when teaching me the Bible.

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:20.740
And on that basis, he accepted a Bible study.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:25.899
Now an area where great care needs to be taken is when we're quoting statistics.

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:32.220
A newspaper may report on a disaster in a certain country and say that 10,000 people were

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.939
killed in the disaster.

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:40.019
And immediately our researchers are going to ask, where did they get that statistic?

00:04:40.019 --> 00:04:43.060
They might phone the newspaper and ask for the source.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.779
And if the reporter can't confirm the statistic, our researchers will go to another source,

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:53.779
a more official source, to get the correct statistic.

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:57.860
Care is also taken when quoting personalities of the past.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:04.579
Now suppose we want to quote something that Napoleon Bonaparte said, the French general.

00:05:04.579 --> 00:05:08.500
Well, being French, Napoleon spoke French.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.860
So if we're quoting it in English, that means that somebody translated the quote from

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.139
French into English.

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.899
But did he translate the quote correctly?

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:25.660
Our researchers will probably go to the target language and research the quote in French

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.500
or in another language.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:33.259
And more often than not, they find that what is presented in English doesn't accurately

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:37.939
represent what the individual said at all.

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:41.779
Now as we age, our memory can play tricks on us.

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:44.980
And our researchers are aware of that.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.699
Suppose that an elderly brother writes in his life story that he was baptized at a circuit

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:52.939
assembly on a certain date.

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:57.259
Our researchers may look at the date, they may check the date.

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:01.899
And suppose they find that the date the brother gave fell on a Tuesday.

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:05.980
Now what are the chances that there was a circuit assembly on a Tuesday?

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.300
There may have been, but they're going to check.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.220
Is the brother's memory failing him?

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.939
If they can't confirm the date, they may ask someone to help the brother to remember the

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:19.939
date more correctly, more accurately.

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:23.379
Perhaps someone was baptized at the same circuit assembly as he was.

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:27.980
And perhaps that person has an accurate note of the date.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:34.300
Our translators also go to great lengths to present accurate information to the brothers

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.939
and sisters.

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:42.100
Sometime ago, the awake magazine published an article on a very rare species of butterfly.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:48.259
Now with all animals and insects, we provide our translators with the Latin name of the

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:50.019
animal or the insect.

00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:52.620
And so our translators had the Latin name.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.620
But in one large country, they were unable to find the name in the vernacular.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.180
So what did they do?

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:05.740
They phoned the country's leading university and they were transferred to the biology department.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:11.660
And there, an expert gave them the name and the vernacular of that particular butterfly.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:17.180
But then he said, why is it that you're worrying so much about the correct name of this butterfly?

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:22.660
If you got it wrong, there are only two of us on the whole country who would know the difference.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.899
Well, that opened the way to give a witness to this expert.

00:07:26.899 --> 00:07:32.959
Well, now how well would you do in spotting a statement that is slightly off and making

00:07:32.959 --> 00:07:34.060
it more accurate?

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.939
Would you like to find out?

00:07:36.939 --> 00:07:38.100
Of course you would.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.420
It'll be fun.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:43.819
So let's take a quiz that I'll call you be the editor.

00:07:43.819 --> 00:07:47.819
We're going to put a number of statements on the screen and there's a problem with each

00:07:47.819 --> 00:07:48.819
one of them.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:56.540
Now your job is to figure out what's wrong, why it is wrong, and then suggest how to fix it.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.060
It's going to be fun.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.740
Here's the first statement.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:07.019
According to the Smithsonian Knowledge Encyclopedia, the Egyptian Sphinx was constructed

00:08:07.019 --> 00:08:10.899
around 2550 BCE.

00:08:10.899 --> 00:08:18.180
The Egyptian Sphinx was constructed around 2550 BCE.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:22.339
Well, the problem is with the date 2550.

00:08:22.339 --> 00:08:27.100
The global flood occurred about 200 years after that date.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:31.500
So what are the chances that the Sphinx survived the flood?

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:35.779
Unless, of course, you think that that's how the Sphinx lost his nose.

00:08:35.779 --> 00:08:41.019
Now these dates are good for you schoolchildren to keep in mind when you're writing reports.

00:08:41.019 --> 00:08:45.059
Sometimes you copy something from an encyclopedia and it gives a certain date.

00:08:45.059 --> 00:08:51.220
But think about the date of the flood, 2370, so that what you put in your report is as

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.980
accurate as possible.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.580
Now let's go on to the next one.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:05.860
In 29 CE, Jesus was baptized by a close relative, John the baptizer.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:09.860
Well, 29 CE, that looks right.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.820
And we know that Jesus was baptized by John, that's right.

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:19.019
So the problem must be close relative and it is.

00:09:19.019 --> 00:09:24.580
Now both of Jesus' parents were of the tribe of Judah and their parents were of the tribe

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:25.899
of Judah.

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:29.539
But what about John's parents, Zechariah and Elizabeth?

00:09:29.539 --> 00:09:31.820
They were both of the tribe of Levi.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:36.220
So Elizabeth and Mary couldn't have been sisters, could they have been cousins?

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.419
Maybe.

00:09:37.419 --> 00:09:39.340
We can't even confirm that.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:43.779
And if they were, that would make Jesus and John second cousins.

00:09:43.779 --> 00:09:47.100
Well as a second cousin, a close relative.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.659
Some would say yes, some would say no.

00:09:49.659 --> 00:09:59.299
So it's safer just to say in 29 CE, Jesus was baptized by a relative, John the baptizer.

00:09:59.299 --> 00:10:00.299
Here's one.

00:10:00.299 --> 00:10:03.379
Let's see if you can spot the error in this one.

00:10:03.379 --> 00:10:08.740
While most of the early Christians were held in littlestime in the community, a few enjoyed

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:11.139
and elevated social status.

00:10:11.139 --> 00:10:17.259
For example, Luke was a respected physician.

00:10:17.259 --> 00:10:20.059
Well the word we need to look at is respected.

00:10:20.059 --> 00:10:27.340
Now we respect our doctors today and our doctors have a very, very fine education, but was

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.220
out the case in the first century.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:34.980
A reference work says this about first century physicians.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:42.940
Many doctors were freed Greek slaves, hence the social standing of doctors was quite low.

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:49.460
Because recovery rates were so low, many people were skeptical or even scornful of doctors.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.340
Note this statement from the first century.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.820
Until recently, the Aulis was a doctor.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.460
Now he is an undertaker.

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:03.940
He's still doing as an undertaker what he used to do as a doctor.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:05.779
Not very flattering is it?

00:11:05.779 --> 00:11:10.580
Well in this case, we'd probably have to use a different example.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.419
Here's one.

00:11:12.419 --> 00:11:20.620
In 325 CE, the Roman Emperor Constantine established Christianity as the official religion of the

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.659
Roman Empire.

00:11:22.659 --> 00:11:30.179
Well, 325 CE, that looks right and Constantine, that looks right.

00:11:30.179 --> 00:11:36.059
But look at the word official, official religion.

00:11:36.059 --> 00:11:41.940
Constantine never established Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:48.460
In 313, he did make it legal to be a Christian, but paganism was still one of the official religions.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:56.179
Apostate Christianity didn't become the official religion until 391 CE.

00:11:56.179 --> 00:11:57.620
This one is tricky.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.139
See how you do on this one.

00:12:00.139 --> 00:12:06.019
Imagine the Apostle Paul during his first imprisonment in Rome, writing his letter to the

00:12:06.019 --> 00:12:09.980
Colossians from a dark prison cell.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:14.379
Well, if you look in the back of the New World Translation, you find that Paul did write

00:12:14.379 --> 00:12:20.620
his letter to the Colossians in Rome, and he was imprisoned at the time.

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.820
So what's the problem?

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.179
Dark prison cell.

00:12:25.179 --> 00:12:30.700
There was Paul during his first imprisonment in his own branded house.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:37.490
So the statement dark prison cell, it's very dramatic, but it's Paul wrong.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.809
Here's an old one.

00:12:39.809 --> 00:12:46.370
While Paul generally preached to people of the nations, Peter was sent to the Jews, contrary

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:51.289
to popular belief, Peter was never in Rome.

00:12:51.289 --> 00:12:56.009
Some scholars used to make that statement and they made it 60 years ago.

00:12:56.009 --> 00:12:59.009
Peter was never in Rome.

00:12:59.009 --> 00:13:00.769
But can we really say that?

00:13:00.769 --> 00:13:02.929
Can we be that dogmatic?

00:13:02.929 --> 00:13:08.289
Can we say that he didn't even spend vacation time or have a short visit in Rome?

00:13:08.289 --> 00:13:09.730
No, we cannot.

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:16.690
So it would be more accurate to state there is no record that Peter ever lived in Rome.

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:19.289
Here's one.

00:13:19.289 --> 00:13:21.889
We can have confidence in the Bible.

00:13:21.889 --> 00:13:25.769
It is mankind's oldest book.

00:13:25.769 --> 00:13:33.529
Some scholars believe that texts written by Adam, Noah, and others survived the flood and

00:13:33.529 --> 00:13:35.009
became part of the Bible.

00:13:35.009 --> 00:13:40.809
And if that were true, then we could say that the Bible is mankind's oldest book.

00:13:40.809 --> 00:13:45.610
Now, here's a quote from inside on the Scriptures, our Bible encyclopedia.

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:52.049
It says, there is no way to establish, definitely, that some of the histories mentioned in the

00:13:52.049 --> 00:13:57.049
book of Genesis were committed to writing before the flood.

00:13:57.049 --> 00:14:03.049
So today we might call the Bible one of mankind's oldest books or the world's oldest modern

00:14:03.049 --> 00:14:06.049
book as we do in one of our videos.

00:14:06.049 --> 00:14:08.049
Here's the last one.

00:14:08.049 --> 00:14:18.049
In 1517, Martin Luther nailed his 95 feces on the door of a church in Vittenburg, Germany.

00:14:18.049 --> 00:14:25.049
Well, we've highlighted 95, but there are questions about the entire statement.

00:14:25.049 --> 00:14:30.049
As some modern scholars have done a tremendous exhaustive study of the life of Martin Luther,

00:14:30.049 --> 00:14:37.049
and they claim that he couldn't have compiled all 95 of his theses by 1517.

00:14:37.049 --> 00:14:45.049
Others go so far as to claim that it never happened, that he never did nail his theses on the door of the church.

00:14:45.049 --> 00:14:50.049
Still others are just as adamant that it's all true, that it all happened.

00:14:50.049 --> 00:14:52.049
So there's no consensus.

00:14:52.049 --> 00:14:59.049
We would have to modify the statement, some believe, or it is believed, in order to make it more accurate,

00:14:59.049 --> 00:15:04.049
and to acknowledge the fact that there are differences of opinion.

00:15:04.049 --> 00:15:08.049
Well, how did you do on the quiz?

00:15:08.049 --> 00:15:12.049
If you're like me, you've probably made some of those statements yourself,

00:15:12.049 --> 00:15:13.049
at times.

00:15:13.049 --> 00:15:17.049
The statements were based on the best of research we had at the time,

00:15:17.049 --> 00:15:20.049
but this is to illustrate the fact that times change.

00:15:20.049 --> 00:15:23.049
Research facilities improve.

00:15:23.049 --> 00:15:28.049
A scholar does exhaustive research on one point of history,

00:15:28.049 --> 00:15:31.049
and he uncovers things that were previously unknown.

00:15:31.049 --> 00:15:33.049
So we have to keep up.

00:15:33.049 --> 00:15:36.049
We have to check, check, check.

00:15:36.049 --> 00:15:45.049
And when credible research reveals that we have to adjust or tweak a statement that we made in the past,

00:15:45.049 --> 00:15:48.049
we do so without hesitation.

00:15:48.049 --> 00:15:53.049
Our goal is to provide information that is as accurate as possible,

00:15:53.049 --> 00:15:56.049
because we know that you, brothers and sisters, use this information.

00:15:56.049 --> 00:15:58.049
You quote it in the field ministry.

00:15:58.049 --> 00:16:00.049
You use it in your public talks.

00:16:00.049 --> 00:16:04.049
And so we want to make sure that our brothers are fed with the most accurate,

00:16:04.049 --> 00:16:07.049
spiritual food possible.

00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:10.049
We're imperfect, of course, and we are going to make mistakes.

00:16:10.049 --> 00:16:13.049
And when we do, we have to correct them.

00:16:13.049 --> 00:16:19.049
Our goal is to do the best we can in all our imperfection.

00:16:19.049 --> 00:16:22.049
Well, how does it make you feel?

00:16:22.049 --> 00:16:24.049
I know how it makes me feel.

00:16:24.049 --> 00:16:29.049
I'm grateful that Jehovah's Organization takes accuracy so seriously.

00:16:29.049 --> 00:16:31.049
He gives me confidence.

00:16:31.049 --> 00:16:35.049
And you know, I'm reminded of the description of another researcher,

00:16:35.049 --> 00:16:42.049
has recorded a Decclesiastes chapter 12 and verses 9 and 10.

00:16:42.049 --> 00:16:44.049
You know who this is.

00:16:44.049 --> 00:16:49.049
Ecclesiastes chapter 12 and verses 9 and 10.

00:16:49.049 --> 00:16:52.049
Not only had the congregator become wise,

00:16:52.049 --> 00:16:56.049
but he continually taught the people what he knew.

00:16:56.049 --> 00:17:02.049
And he pondered and made a thorough search

00:17:02.049 --> 00:17:05.049
in order to compile many Proverbs.

00:17:05.049 --> 00:17:08.049
The congregator sought to find delightful words

00:17:08.049 --> 00:17:12.049
and to record accurate words of truth.
