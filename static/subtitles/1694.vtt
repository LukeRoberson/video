00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.580
I was born in Hong Kong in 1952.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.580
When I was about just over 14 years of age,

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.580
my mother sent me down and said,

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.580
look, there's a marriage maker

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.579
and the gentleman he's agreed to take you as his wife.

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:22.579
I was absolutely petrified.

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:24.579
I never met him before.

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:29.579
We actually 20 years different between age.

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.579
But I wanted to go through because I love my mum.

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.579
I want her to be able to have a chance of happiness.

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.579
I came to England.

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:41.579
I'm not long after that.

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.579
We started our first Chinese takeaway in that mid-tooth town.

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.579
I had to work very hard.

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:56.759
Seven days a week to help my husband run the business.

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:59.759
I was the only Chinese woman in the entire town.

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:03.759
I have nowhere to ask for help or advice.

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:06.760
So I have a really bad time.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.760
When my second daughter was born,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.760
when she just stopped breathing,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.760
and a few minutes later,

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.760
the nurse came out and said,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.760
go to one flower for his garden

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.760
and that's where your daughter's gone.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.760
So at that moment of time,

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.760
I was very hungry.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.760
And I feel sad and sorrow and lonely.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.760
When I have the horrible guilt,

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.760
it's my fault.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.760
Oh, it's God.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.760
It's his fault.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.760
So I stopped praying to God.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.140
One day, there was one very kind lady

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.140
who came to me, not my daughter.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.140
And then eventually, one day,

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.140
the ladies stopped me and had a conversation.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.140
And the conversation lead to why people die

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.140
and what happened when they're dead.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.140
Knowing is no body thought.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.140
It's just our imperfection.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.140
I found out the great relief.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.140
God did not punish me for that.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.140
And from then on,

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.139
I started a Bible study for her.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.139
But my study,

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:15.139
focusing very slow by that time,

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:16.139
our heart.

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:17.139
Six children.

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:20.139
I also have to work full time.

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:23.139
And also, the lady doesn't speak Chinese.

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:30.689
And my English is no better than her Chinese side.

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:33.689
When I dedicated my life to Jehovah,

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:35.689
it's not been easy.

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.689
If I as my husband concerned,

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.689
his wife should be concentrate,

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:42.689
looking after family and business,

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:45.689
some wasting time on religions like that.

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:47.689
My mum as well,

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:49.689
very much against me,

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:51.689
become Jehovah witnesses.

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:56.370
My husband showed up me,

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.370
often he gave me her time,

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.250
because I want to take all my children to the meeting.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.250
One day, he wanted me to choose between him

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.250
or Jehovah.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.250
When I prayed to Jehovah,

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.250
I said, Jehovah,

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.250
now it's a time,

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.250
I need your Holy Spirit to help me.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.250
And I said,

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.250
my husband is a good man,

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.250
and he deserved to know

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.250
why I choose my life.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.250
And I just feel so calm.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.250
And then I turn around

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.250
and I ask my husband,

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.250
what do you think of me

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.250
since I've become a witness?

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.250
Am I a better wife?

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.250
Or am I getting worse?

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.250
So my husband said,

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.250
oh,

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.250
okay then,

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.250
if that was the case,

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.039
go serve your God Jehovah.

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:48.039
Before my mother died,

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:51.039
my mother actually prayed to Jehovah

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:55.039
to thank him to say,

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:58.039
since I've become a Jehovah witnesses,

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:01.039
I've become a better daughter.

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:03.039
I remember one day,

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:05.039
one of my Bible students

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:07.039
came up to my house

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:09.039
and she was crying,

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:11.039
because she suffered persecution

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:12.039
from her husband.

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:14.039
And my husband was

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:16.040
sitting next to me,

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.040
and then he turned around and said,

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.040
you just have to persevere,

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.040
because my wife went through

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.040
the same experience

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.040
and looked where she is now.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.040
The last 10 years,

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.040
my husband came to

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.040
all the meeting with me,

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.040
seeing my children happy,

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.040
it's the most important thing for me,

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.040
and they're not only happy for a short time,

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.040
but they also have a happy future.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.040
My life now,

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.040
I'm no longer lonely,

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.040
I'm no longer a fatherless child,

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.040
because I know Jehovah care for me,

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.040
Jehovah help a little woman like me,

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.040
and I'm sure Jehovah will help anybody

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.040
who has towards him.
