00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:08.859
On November 12, 2014, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation upheld a lower court

00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:14.140
decision to liquidate the legal entity of Jehovah's Witnesses in Samara, one of the largest

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.939
cities in Russia.

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:20.579
The Supreme Court dismissed the witnesses' appeal, contesting the allegations of extremism,

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:24.980
the actions of the police, and the heavy-handed punishment.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.500
How did Russian law enforcement authorities go about liquidating the Samara legal entity?

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.500
What does this mean for Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia?

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.819
The publications the police discovered had been added to the list of extremist materials

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:14.340
through Russian court decisions, decisions that they were based on supposed expert studies

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.219
of the witnesses' religious literature.

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:21.260
Before both the lower court and the Supreme Court, the witnesses maintained that the police

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.659
conducting the search planted the banned literature and then used it as a pretext to bring

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.859
charges against the witnesses.

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:34.459
The Supreme Court arrested our children and, accordingly, the court, the court, and the court.

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:36.459
He supported the decision.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.900
These arrested cases hÃ¤shelf traitorously believed in the government of the Russians.

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:51.159
Why did the Supreme Court stepped against these protectors so that the riot wasn't

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.260
topiced?

00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:00.019
The Supreme Court had no set motive and, certainly without a change,

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:01.519
had led their respective prop Jeepers.

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:11.520
The witnesses are concerned that the court ruling will serve as a basis for religious persecution,

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.520
as has already occurred in the city of Taginrock, roast of region.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.520
We expect that the same thing will happen in the United States,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.520
so we have a very calm process.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.520
We can't be as calm as we are going to do right now,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.520
as we are going to do right now.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.520
In the basis of their study, they lie in love to people,

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.520
respect, tolerance,

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.520
because religious and extremism are not the same.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.520
Russian authorities are conducting similar investigations of witness legal entities

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.520
in various parts of the country.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:08.520
It remains to be seen how this will affect the nearly 180,000 witnesses living in Russia.
