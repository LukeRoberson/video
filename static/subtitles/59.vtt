00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:09.169
Welcome to JW Broadcasting. This is my friend Saki Morei, a helper to the writing committee

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:14.289
of the governing body. He's here to help me discuss the gifts we present to Jehovah

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:19.489
God. Saki, can you tell us what the program is all about?

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:25.890
It would be my pleasure. We'll meet sister Lillian Barnes. Regardless of our age, we can

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:33.409
learn from her example of loyal endurance. What Bible Council for young ones continues to

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:39.570
motivate her to serve Jehovah whole soul. We'll go to the United States branch and walk

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:47.969
Hill, New York, to see how they produce Braille Bibles. How has the revised newer translation

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.090
in Braille helped these brothers and sisters give their gifts to God?

00:00:53.490 --> 00:01:02.530
And why is physical cleanliness an important part of our clean worship? We'll find out

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.569
in this dramatization from the Principles for Daily Living Series.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:35.650
This is the April 2019 edition of JW Broadcasting. This month I'd like to talk about presenting

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:42.450
your gifts to God. We certainly have every reason to consider this topic. Well, why is that?

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.209
It's because JW gives us so much. James chapter 1 verse 17 says,

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:55.810
every good gift and every perfect present is from above, coming down from the father of the

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:03.329
celestial lights. For example, JW Broadcasting allows us to enjoy the gift of life even though

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:10.210
our first parents tried to take that from us. He's provided us with a variety of foods.

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:18.770
The environment has just right to support life. He's given us his precious word, the Bible,

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:25.250
so that we can come to know him and his purposes. And the greatest perfect present,

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:32.610
Jehovah's given us, is the ransom. Jehovah sacrificed a great deal to arrange for Jesus to

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:41.009
buy back for us the hope of everlasting life. This was at no obligation on Jehovah's part. It was

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:50.370
totally a gift of love. Please read with me 1 John 49. By this the love of God was revealed in

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:57.009
our case that God sent his only begotten son into the world so that we might gain life through him.

00:02:57.729 --> 00:03:04.610
What a gift of love from Jehovah, our God. What does that move us to do? Maybe you've had the

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:12.610
experience of a close friend or family member unexpectedly giving you a valuable gift. Immediately,

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.530
what are you thinking? You're probably trying to think of what you can give in return.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:27.810
How much more so would we want to present our gifts to God so as to show our sincere appreciation

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:35.169
for all he's done? Let's consider some possible gifts that Jehovah would be pleased to receive from us.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.889
Many of you and our viewing audience have been moved to give your life to Jehovah,

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:49.250
dedicating yourself to do his will. That's commendable. That's what Romans 12 urges us to do.

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:57.250
However, there are some of you listening who've thought about this way of giving back to Jehovah,

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:04.930
but you haven't yet taken this vital step. Notice the appeal the Apostle Paul makes at Romans 12

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:12.210
1. Therefore, I appeal to you by the compassion of God-brothers to present your bodies as a living

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:20.769
sacrifice, wholly unacceptable to God, a sacred service with your power of reason. Your life is

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:28.769
precious. Presenting your body your whole soul to God is one of the best gifts you can give to

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:35.889
you. This involves our sacred service to Jehovah. That's for sure. But what about the daily

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:43.730
activities of life? Some of you do housework on a daily basis. Others of you have school to attend

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:51.970
and homework to do. Many of you perform secular work. They're shopping to do. Others enjoy using

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:58.050
a small percentage of their time to engage in some type of recreation or entertainment.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:05.490
Once you're dedicated and baptized, this is all part of your gift to Jehovah.

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:15.889
Please consider with me Colossians 323 and 24. After discussing a whole list of daily

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:24.689
activities of life, what does Jehovah tell us? Colossians 323 and 24. Whatever you're doing,

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:32.449
work at a whole soul as for Jehovah and not for men. For you know that it is from Jehovah,

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:39.089
you will receive the inheritance as a reward. It's true that a Christian's day-to-day

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:47.649
activities are not part of his sacred service. However, the fact that Paul urges us to work whole

00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:55.810
soul as to Jehovah makes us think of our entire course of life. Yes, our life course can become

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:03.490
a gift presented to God. For example, do we act and dress with proper decorum at all times?

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:10.370
Understandably, we don't wear a suit and tie or dress for every activity of life.

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:18.449
But in whatever you're doing, is your behavior and dress a gift to Jehovah?

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:25.810
If while engaging in any activity, we'd be embarrassed to identify ourselves as one of Jehovah's

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:32.449
witnesses, then can we really claim to be presenting a gift to Jehovah in our daily life?

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:40.930
What other gifts are in our possession that we can present to God? What about God's morality?

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:49.250
Keeping your dedicated body clean morally is a gift to Jehovah. Did you notice what Romans 12

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:57.889
one said? It said that the bodies we present to Jehovah should be holy and acceptable to God.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:08.689
If we give into temptation unrepentantly, that could be likened to asking Jehovah to give our gift back.

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:17.649
We're taking back our dedicated life from him, worse yet, his tantamount to taking the gift away

00:07:17.649 --> 00:07:27.089
from Jehovah and giving that precious gift to Satan. That does not make sense. Keep clean morally.

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:34.529
It's a precious gift presented to God. It's true. When we're dedicated and baptized,

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:40.129
there are other gifts that we'd be expected to present to Jehovah on a regular basis.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:46.610
One of the most obvious ways, as mentioned here at Hebrews 1023,

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:58.300
did you already guess what this gift to Jehovah would be? Hebrews 1023. Let us whole firmly

00:07:58.379 --> 00:08:04.540
the public declaration of our hope without wavering. For the one who promised is faithful.

00:08:05.579 --> 00:08:13.819
The public declaration of our hope is a gift to those we speak to, but it's also considered a gift

00:08:13.819 --> 00:08:23.100
extended to Jehovah. In fact, Hebrews 1315 calls our preaching work a sacrifice of praise,

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:29.259
that is the fruit of our lips that make public declaration to his name.

00:08:30.459 --> 00:08:38.379
Israelites used to regularly offer the best of their animals or grain as sacrificial gifts to

00:08:38.379 --> 00:08:46.940
Jehovah. Sharing in the ministry formally or informally is a gift to God. Regularly attending

00:08:47.019 --> 00:08:53.179
our Christian meetings and participating in them is part of our worship and pleases Jehovah.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:09:00.860
We're familiar with Hebrews 1024 and 25. It speaks of our custom of meeting together

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:09.259
and for what purpose do we meet? If I was there in your home with you, how would you answer?

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:16.299
You might quickly say, I go to the meetings to be built up and to be encouraged spiritually.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:24.220
Well, no doubt you do. But at Hebrews 1024 and 25, the purpose of attending is expressed

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:33.259
in a totally different way. Instead of going with the soul intent of being encouraged,

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:43.740
verse 24 says, we're to consider one another, so as to incite others to love and find works.

00:09:44.059 --> 00:09:54.460
Verse 25 says, we're to be encouraging one another. We should attend our meetings with the goal of

00:09:54.460 --> 00:10:03.580
being a gift to others. Encouraging others is the goal. We do this by our sincere interest in others

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:09.980
before and after the meeting. Do you come to the kingdom hall early to encourage others?

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:16.220
When in the traveling work years ago, my wife and I drove into the parking lot

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:23.740
and got out of our car. Two brothers approached us and warmly said, brother and sister heard,

00:10:24.539 --> 00:10:31.019
we were waiting for you. We're so happy to have you with our congregation this week.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:41.980
Were they elders, ministerial servants, or pioneer? No. They were two little pre-teen age boys.

00:10:43.179 --> 00:10:50.700
That boost gave us a fine start for a special week of activity. We also encourage others

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:56.379
by participating in the meetings. What an encouragement to the whole congregation.

00:10:57.259 --> 00:11:03.259
Of course, if we all all go to the meetings with that goal and motive,

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:13.259
what will be the result to us individually? We all will come away, build up and encourage spiritually.

00:11:14.779 --> 00:11:19.899
But we must never forget that being at our Christian meetings and participating,

00:11:19.899 --> 00:11:28.539
including singing the songs and saying amen to the prayers is actually worshiping Jehovah.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:33.659
You're presenting a gift to him at every meeting you attend.

00:11:35.419 --> 00:11:40.860
From ancient times until now, Jehovah's faithful servants have contributed materially

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:48.539
to the support of true worship. That's presenting a gift to God as well. And we thank all of you

00:11:49.179 --> 00:11:56.460
for your support. The governing body is able to provide so much for the benefit of the worldwide

00:11:56.460 --> 00:12:04.299
brotherhood because of your generosity. Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:12.139
What about you, Christian parents? What gift can you present to Jehovah? Your children,

00:12:12.139 --> 00:12:17.740
when you do your best to bring your children up in the discipline and admonition of Jehovah,

00:12:18.539 --> 00:12:25.419
you are preparing a gift to your God. Think of the number of brothers taking the lead and the

00:12:25.419 --> 00:12:33.179
organization at this time. Some are governing body members, helpers, branch committee members,

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:41.580
circuit overseers, elders, and ministerial servants. Where did so many of these come from?

00:12:42.539 --> 00:12:48.379
Hundreds of thousands were children of Christian parents. The parents followed the admonition of

00:12:48.379 --> 00:12:56.700
Ephesians chapter 6 verse 4. There are thousands more brothers and sisters that have been raised in

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:03.980
the truth by godly parents who are spearheading the word in the ministry, in Bethel service,

00:13:04.539 --> 00:13:11.980
on construction projects, and in relief work. We thank you parents for all that you've done

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:18.779
and the precious gifts you've offered up to Jehovah and his organization. And what about the older

00:13:18.779 --> 00:13:27.820
ones in our congregations? I'm 84 years young with eternity in view, but at some point we start to

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:35.659
admit that we're getting old. We start to feel that we're getting old. We start to look

00:13:36.539 --> 00:13:42.700
like we're getting old. Some of us find ourselves slipping physically or even mentally.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:50.860
Are we becoming less and less valuable to Jehovah? Is our gift now tarnished by age?

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:59.659
We might begin to think so, but that's not at all how Jehovah views older ones who had dedicated

00:13:59.659 --> 00:14:09.340
themselves to him possibly many decades ago. A tarnished gold coin has as much value as a shiny

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:19.100
new one. Probably 1631 instructs us that gray hair is a crown of beauty when it is found in the way

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:25.500
of righteousness. It's not so much the color of the hair Jehovah admires,

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:34.379
and it's the life of self-sacrifice that gray hair represents. Jehovah views older ones who are

00:14:34.379 --> 00:14:43.019
still found in the way of righteousness to be precious gifts to him. Why do pieces of antique

00:14:43.019 --> 00:14:51.340
furniture often cost much more than a brand new piece of furniture? Or why is an older bottle

00:14:51.340 --> 00:15:00.940
of fine wine often more expensive than a newer vintage wine? Age brings value to a gift.

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:09.740
You older ones have wisdom and experience that others in the congregation can benefit from.

00:15:09.899 --> 00:15:17.899
It's not that you need to be holding the microphone and waxing eloquent on every paragraph at a

00:15:17.899 --> 00:15:25.100
meeting, but modestly sharing your experience and wisdom with others on a personal basis can be

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:33.659
so helpful and encouraging. Jehovah loves you older ones, so even if you're bent with age

00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:45.340
in your mind, stand tall as a precious gift presented to Jehovah. May all of us young and old

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:53.100
consider how we can enhance our gifts presented to Jehovah. If we have not yet dedicated our life to

00:15:53.100 --> 00:16:02.220
God, is it time to seriously consider this gift? Can we enhance our gift by more closely monitoring

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:09.820
our view of Christian morality? What we look at or think about could compromise our gift to God?

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:16.700
How about our ministry, our attendance and participation at the meetings, or contributing

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:27.179
materially to the worldwide work? You parents, do your best to package the gift of your children

00:16:27.899 --> 00:16:36.139
so that they will be useful to Jehovah and you older ones. Never forget that when it comes to wisdom

00:16:37.019 --> 00:16:46.220
and experience, you only get better with age. Jesus is the best of Jehovah's servants. He's been

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:55.860
around the longest. Let's meet a sister who's applied the counsel to serve God from her youth on.

00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:03.460
Sister Lydia Barnes is from Jamaica. Her gifts to Jehovah may have changed with age,

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:21.170
but what she gives to him today is in no way less valuable. I was born in the year 1911. I think I

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:29.970
began to learn about the truth in the 1930s. We never have a baby study like we're having no

00:17:30.769 --> 00:17:39.569
I always read this watchtower magazine because when I read that magazine, that's what got me

00:17:39.569 --> 00:17:49.250
interested so I keep reading. I could remember it was a convention we had and that back there was

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:58.769
but a drug root afford was the one who lived at the talk. So we should go and advertise, advertise,

00:17:58.769 --> 00:18:06.450
advertise the King and the Kingdom. I realized that this was something different so that is

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:16.529
where I make my personal decision. I was at stop advertising. I take any and every opportunity

00:18:16.609 --> 00:18:22.690
to witness to people. Lots of people come and visit me. Nobody has ever come

00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:31.250
in my house and they don't get a terrible witness. I sometimes in and out of the hospital

00:18:32.369 --> 00:18:41.809
and so even in the hospital, I have my territory right there. I do it in nurses, I do it in my doctor.

00:18:42.529 --> 00:18:47.490
I wouldn't say that somebody helped me because I would say I am helping somebody.

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:57.970
That is so and neat. I always find myself talking to Jehovah. Sometimes we have uncertainties

00:18:58.849 --> 00:19:07.809
and I would solicit Jehovah's help. Scripture shall we should remember our grand creator

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:15.890
in the days of our youth before these evil days come. I am now a hundred and six.

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:25.009
I am not able to do as before so I will say it's a good thing I always use the days of my youth

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:35.009
to do a lot of what's possible in Jehovah's service. Nothing could make me relax now. I always have

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:41.170
to be talking about Jehovah and the many blessings that I receive at his hands.

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:49.250
Imagine that we can make Jehovah's heart with joy. It's a pleasure. So I enjoy that very much.

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:59.970
The muscles know, you know, not for a month strong as before. I don't work on the street by myself.

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:06.289
Somebody has taught me to dicking them hard here. If my brothers they don't see me at the meeting.

00:20:06.849 --> 00:20:14.369
I want to know what happens is the band because everybody is looking forward to see me there.

00:20:15.569 --> 00:20:24.190
And I will say good morning brothers and they're with my morning sister bands and some of them

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:31.869
had a wonderful name for calling me. Some is listening forward for my comment. So I find

00:20:31.869 --> 00:20:39.549
and the brothers are happy to have met the meeting and I told them when they feel that way about

00:20:39.549 --> 00:20:48.670
making me feel good too because I can see that I am of some use. When we miss the meeting,

00:20:48.670 --> 00:21:00.430
we lose a lot. I want all of us as a family then to enjoy Jehovah's new world to come.

00:21:01.069 --> 00:21:10.190
My determination is to walk with Jehovah, be it to the end of my life or to the end of the

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:17.230
soul-gisting. I shall return to the days of my youth and my flesh will be fresher than that of a

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:37.200
deed. Remember then your grand creator and the days of your youth. That was sister bands' determination.

00:21:37.759 --> 00:21:46.720
Lillian is now 108 years old and has been baptized for nearly 82 years. Her beautiful example

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:52.400
shows the contentment that comes from serving God whole soul at any age.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:22:00.480
To give Jehovah our best, we need God's Word to know how to worship Him. That's why Jehovah's

00:22:00.559 --> 00:22:08.240
organization works hard to make the Bible available to as many people as possible. At the United

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:15.200
States branch in Wal-Kill, New York, they are producing braille copies of the revised new world

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:23.680
translation. What does it take to make a good quality braille Bible and how our braille readers using

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:34.579
beautiful gift? In 2013 our English printed Bibles were revised and shortly thereafter the

00:22:34.579 --> 00:22:40.019
braille Bibles were approved to be revised in English and Portuguese. We knew it was going to be a

00:22:40.019 --> 00:22:46.180
large job. We were having problems with the pages either tearing or coming completely out of the

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:52.500
Bible. We tried changing the paper to see if that would be a simple solution and we had a brother

00:22:52.579 --> 00:22:57.619
who is blind come in and help us. We would be able to test the paper in the machine and actually

00:22:57.619 --> 00:23:03.700
walk it right over to the brother and he gave us immediate feedback on adjustments to the machine

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:11.940
or if it wasn't working at all. During our testing we tried about 25 different types of paper

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:18.660
but we ended up coming back to the idea that the binding was the best way to find a durable solution.

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:25.140
The result is that the durability is 400 percent stronger than it was before. You can pick up an

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:32.180
entire book by holding just one page. In the Literature Production Office we have ones who receive

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:38.019
the requests for the braille Bibles. We have ones who review these requests as they come into the system

00:23:38.019 --> 00:23:42.819
and then we have a separate set of brothers who make sure that all the materials are here on time.

00:23:43.619 --> 00:23:48.180
We get our orders from the office and then the office will then tell us how many to make

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:54.099
maybe the specific volume number. Braille Bibles come from the Wal-Kill Prennery on the Braille

00:23:54.099 --> 00:23:59.539
production floor. Right at the end of the machine we have a Braille paper roll. We make sure that

00:23:59.539 --> 00:24:04.579
there's nothing wrong with that roll and then it gets fed into the machine. It creates Braille on

00:24:04.579 --> 00:24:10.259
both sides of the page and after that it gets cut and punched. We gather it do some quality

00:24:10.259 --> 00:24:15.619
inspection. We'll bind it together. We'll rivet each section into a binder that has been

00:24:15.619 --> 00:24:20.660
pre-labeled with the volume number. Do an inspection on it, pop it in a box and then send it out

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:26.819
the door. To produce the English Bible and Braille it takes about four and a half hours which then

00:24:26.819 --> 00:24:32.099
breaks out into 28 volumes and the Portuguese Bible and Braille takes closer to five and a half

00:24:32.099 --> 00:24:38.420
hours and that breaks out into 32 volumes. We did not start production with Genesis because

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:42.099
we wanted the brothers and sisters to be able to receive the volume that would be on the

00:24:42.099 --> 00:24:49.299
congregation Bible reading schedule at our midweek meetings. So as we receive the files for each volume

00:24:49.299 --> 00:24:55.380
it's being printed and sent out to our brothers and sisters. It's important to me to be able to

00:24:55.380 --> 00:25:03.140
read God's Word rather than just listening because I am a visual person so the eyesight is gone

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:09.940
but I'm still visual. I learn better from reading than I do from listening. In my mind when I'm

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:15.940
listening my mind wonders but when I'm reading I can stop and meditate on what I'm studying

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:21.859
that helps me with my relationship with Jehovah. It has helped me a lot because a lot of things I

00:25:21.859 --> 00:25:27.539
don't have to look up because it's in plain English. They have so many things in this new Bible that I

00:25:27.539 --> 00:25:35.539
can use like the outline. I can get that outline and find something fast. It has the appendix. It has

00:25:35.539 --> 00:25:41.940
the word index, the glossary. During the time of the memorial I was able to read the events of

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:51.220
the last week of Jesus' life. I really enjoy reading with one hand and pulling the other hand

00:25:51.220 --> 00:26:00.420
down and reading the fun notes. I can participate more in the midweek meeting for instance in the

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:06.259
section digging for spiritual gyms. The brothers always get someone from the audience to read the

00:26:06.259 --> 00:26:13.299
scriptures. So once I got the new Bible I could raise my hand and go out and to read and so the

00:26:13.299 --> 00:26:24.980
whole meeting opened up. The revised edition helps me be more effective as a me and helps me to

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:32.019
find exactly what I need. Before the revision when he'd have a part on the meeting he would have to

00:26:32.019 --> 00:26:37.299
get his brailler out and have me dictate one sentence at a time so he could type it all out what he

00:26:37.299 --> 00:26:43.460
was going to use in his part. So this is nice because he has the right wording that all the friends have.

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:49.859
I like to carry it from house to house so I can only take the one volume because they're huge

00:26:49.859 --> 00:26:55.700
but whatever the initial call is I can take that scripture and see if the household will let me

00:26:55.700 --> 00:27:03.220
read a scripture for them. It means so much to be able to read the scriptures to do the personal study.

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:10.019
I am very thankful for all the work our brothers have done and been walkable. I really appreciate

00:27:10.019 --> 00:27:17.940
the effort that they've all gone through because that's a lot of work. Then Jehovah's organization

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:23.619
they care for everyone. I was so thankful that they had the Braille Bible for the blind.

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:30.420
That's what draws me closer to Jehovah. Being able to study his word and look the scriptures up.

00:27:31.299 --> 00:27:37.700
The new Bible is personal to me. I feel like it was a personal answer to prayer. Jehovah

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:45.140
supplied it because that's the main thing I wanted to read and I am so thankful to Jehovah.

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:56.990
Like these brothers and sisters treasure the gift of God's word. We pray that Jehovah continue

00:27:56.990 --> 00:28:04.509
to bless the efforts to make the revised New World Translation available in more languages and formats.

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:12.029
With the Bible and Christian publications we're equipped to do all we can in the preaching work.

00:28:12.829 --> 00:28:20.349
That desire to fully accomplish our ministry is captured in this month's original song.

00:28:21.150 --> 00:32:38.859
All I can give. In what ways did you see the brothers and sisters giving all they can in the

00:32:38.859 --> 00:32:46.059
ministry? They witnessed at every opportunity. They preached or to door in the public witnessing

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:52.779
at businesses, informally and in remote areas. They used our teaching toolbox

00:32:52.779 --> 00:33:01.019
including videos to reach people in a language they really understand. The ministry is an important

00:33:01.019 --> 00:33:07.740
way we imitate Jehovah's love for people. We also want to imitate Jehovah's holiness.

00:33:08.619 --> 00:33:15.740
Brotherhood explained why we strive to stay morally clean. But what about keeping physically

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:23.500
clean? That's not always easy for busy Christians. In this dramatization see how Grayson gives his

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:36.619
son the loving counsel on cleanliness that he needs. I graduated high school that summer and wanted

00:33:36.619 --> 00:33:46.670
to start regular pioneering. That's my dad Grayson. Dad was having car trouble that morning

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:57.069
and needed a ride to work so I gave him one. Okay my car was a little messy and smelly.

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:09.570
I mean it was winter and my car is pretty old anyway so I bother. When I get a new car

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:24.880
then I'll keep it clean. But he was making a big deal out of nothing. That morning was not good.

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:42.369
I thought it was over but later that evening dad brought it up again. But this time it went better.

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:50.530
He showed me a picture of his first car. It looked pretty old too. He said that while our home

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:57.489
or car may not be fancy or luxurious it should be as clean and presentable as circumstances allow.

00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:05.889
I still didn't see what the big deal was. Then he explained that Jehovah is a clean guy and from

00:35:05.889 --> 00:35:12.449
ancient times has always required that his people be a clean people. Under the mosaic law that

00:35:12.449 --> 00:35:20.670
Jehovah gave to Israel cleanness and worship were inseparable. It specified that priests were

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:26.510
required to wash their hands and feet before offering sacrifices to Jehovah. While in an unclean

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:38.670
state an israelite could not have any part in worship or it could mean death. I said I'm not an

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:45.630
israelite and we're not under the mosaic law anymore. He said true but it gives us insight

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:51.550
into Jehovah's thinking. The law emphasized that cleanness was required of all those who worshiped

00:35:51.550 --> 00:36:01.409
him and as Malachi 36 tells us Jehovah has not changed. Then he said something that really stuck

00:36:01.409 --> 00:36:11.059
with me. Besides it's not all about us. Didn't he gave me a scripture to look up? It was second

00:36:11.059 --> 00:36:20.260
Corinthians 6, 3, and 4. And no way are we giving any cause for stumbling so that no fault

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:27.139
may be found with our ministry but in every way we recommend ourselves as God's ministers.

00:36:42.159 --> 00:36:49.360
I realized that things like our appearance, our homes, and our cars. These can all be a solid

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:57.360
witness to Jehovah in themselves. It made sense to me now. It's not all about us. I knew what I

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:11.820
had to do. Not only did I clean my car but later that year I was able to turn my application for

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:24.820
pioneering and I'm glad for the lesson I learned from my dad. It's not all about us. Even in little

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:34.559
ways we can reflect favorably on the God we love. What made Grayson's counsel effective?

00:37:36.159 --> 00:37:45.119
Although he reacted to sitting in the dirty car, he waited until he was calm to give counsel.

00:37:45.119 --> 00:37:52.320
He based what he said on God's standards in the Bible. And it took humility for his son to see

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:57.360
that his cleanliness could affect how others viewed Jehovah's clean people.

00:37:58.719 --> 00:38:05.360
Humility helps us to accept correction but it can do even more. It was the topic of this

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:14.400
Bethel Morning worship wherein Brother Mark Numer asks why humility was such an important lesson

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:21.920
for Jesus' apostles and why it still is for us today. It is interesting that Peter gives

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:28.880
counsel about cultivating humility. Let's turn the clock back and learn why the quality of humility

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:35.199
was indelibly etched in the mind and heart of Peter. Let's open our Bibles to Luke chapter 22.

00:38:37.199 --> 00:38:42.559
In Luke chapter 22 we'll find Jesus getting ready for that final Passover in 33 CE

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:53.840
and Luke 22 starting in verse 8 it is Thursday afternoon nice in 13 what happens verse 8. Jesus sent

00:38:53.840 --> 00:39:03.440
Peter, there he is, and John saying go and get the Passover ready for us to eat. Get it ready Peter

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:10.320
John 9. They said to him where do you want us to get it ready? They understood the instructions.

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:16.960
Get it ready. Jesus said going to Jerusalem you'll find the man with the earthenware jar

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:27.199
verse 12 and that man will show you a large furnished upper room. Get it ready there. Verse 13

00:39:27.199 --> 00:39:33.599
so they left and founded just as he had told them and they prepared for the Passover.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.760
Get it ready. Prepare the Passover. What would that include?

00:39:41.039 --> 00:39:55.119
Bread, wine, oil for the lamps, lamb, towel, basin, water, basin and water. They knew how important

00:39:55.119 --> 00:40:02.159
washing feet were. They witnessed when Jesus approved Simon the Pharisee with the statement Simon

00:40:02.239 --> 00:40:09.760
you gave me no water for my feet. Simon you gave me no water. You missed the mark on this one.

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:19.360
So as they stared at that basin and water as they prepared and got the room ready did they look

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:27.119
at each other and wonder who's going to wash the feet? Who's going to do it? They had a golden

00:40:27.119 --> 00:40:31.760
opportunity to apply all the things that Jesus had been teaching them for three and a half years

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:37.920
on humility. This was the time three and a half years. Conduct yourself as a lesser one. Don't

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:43.840
lord it over others. You want to serve others and not be served. This was it. This was the time

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:49.360
they could have showed Jesus that they got the point. They got it. They had time to think about it,

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:57.519
time to pray about it. It was Thursday afternoon. But now we progress and let's see what happens.

00:40:57.519 --> 00:41:03.360
Let's now progress to the evening and now it's nice and 14. Let's pick up the account in John chapter

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:12.079
13. They got the room ready. They followed the instructions and now let's go to John 13 and get John's

00:41:12.079 --> 00:41:19.440
vantage point from this. He was there. He was with Peter getting it ready. So now it's 98 CE

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:25.599
and John is writing this information. He had time to reflect and to think about this for years.

00:41:26.559 --> 00:41:36.079
And now look what he says in verse three. So Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things

00:41:36.079 --> 00:41:43.280
into his hands and that he came from God and was going to God, knowing these things. He understood

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:49.920
that. He sat back and said, Jesus knew who he was. He knew all things. He had the full understanding

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:56.719
of his dignity. He knew that he had been entrusted with all things. He knew. He knew he was the second

00:41:56.719 --> 00:42:02.159
greatest personage in the universe. He knew he was the first born of all creation. He knew he had

00:42:02.159 --> 00:42:07.599
shared with his father and creating all things. He had knowledge of all this knowing all these

00:42:07.599 --> 00:42:18.320
things. John sits back. He writes this and then knowing this verse four, the contrast. He got up

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:25.280
from the evening meal and laid aside his outer garments. Taking a towel wraps it around his waist.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.400
After that, he puts the water into the basin, starts to wash the feet of the disciples and dry

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:37.679
them off with the towel that was wrapped around him knowing who he was. John said he did this.

00:42:39.039 --> 00:42:47.360
But not only does John reflect on who Jesus was, no, he reflects on why Jesus did it. Why did he

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:55.920
do it? That's what John was interested in. And we get that answer back in verse one where John says,

00:42:55.920 --> 00:43:04.559
why? Because he loved his own and that were in the world. He loved them to the end. John said,

00:43:04.559 --> 00:43:10.159
he loved them to the end. What does that mean? He wanted to instill in them qualities that would

00:43:10.159 --> 00:43:15.280
help them conquer the world. Qualities that would strengthen the Christian congregation.

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:22.239
Qualities such as unselfish love and humility, he loved them to the end. He never gave up on them.

00:43:22.239 --> 00:43:29.840
They had their weaknesses, but he did not give up. Now, for Peter some 30 years later, he's

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:36.639
thinking about humility. John some 60 years later, after the lesson Jesus taught about humility,

00:43:36.639 --> 00:43:44.719
it's echoing loud and clear in his mind and heart. However, the fact remains that neither of them

00:43:44.719 --> 00:43:50.000
had the humility at the time to apply what Jesus had been teaching them for three and a half years.

00:43:51.519 --> 00:43:58.559
Now, after John finished his writing, he sits back. He was under inspiration. He finished that

00:43:58.559 --> 00:44:04.079
writing. Did he sit back, reread what he just wrote? Perhaps he said to himself,

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:13.199
I wish I could have written. After Jesus washed the feet of one or two of his disciples,

00:44:14.159 --> 00:44:22.400
I got up and washed the feet of the rest of my brothers. I took that towel and I imitated

00:44:23.039 --> 00:44:32.880
the Christ. Or Peter and I got up, but the point is they didn't. What can we learn? Don't allow

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:39.920
valuable lessons that Jesus teaches us to echo in our minds and hearts only after we miss the

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:47.039
opportunity to apply them. So in a practical setting for us serving here at Bethel,

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:54.880
even though I know I have the seniority, I have full knowledge of my seniority,

00:44:54.880 --> 00:45:04.079
will I get up and fight the attitude of entitlement. I know I have authority and trusted to me as

00:45:04.239 --> 00:45:09.519
the overseer. I am the overseer. I know that. I have full knowledge of that. Fine.

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:16.639
Will I get up and roll my sleeves back and do the grunt work or do I just find pleasure in giving

00:45:16.639 --> 00:45:24.800
orders? I know. I have a wonderful privilege of service. I know that. Others know it too. Fine.

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:31.360
But will I get up to train others? Brother Jackson reminded us of this at the last Gilead

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:38.880
graduation when he said treasure your privileges but don't hoard them. That means we have to get up.

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:48.800
It takes humility to train others to take our place as a brother or a sister. I know I have more

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:55.440
experience than the other person in my job. I know I have the experience. I know that. I have more

00:45:55.440 --> 00:46:04.639
experience than my workmate. Fine. But will I get up and all humility and share information that I

00:46:04.639 --> 00:46:11.360
have with others to make their job easier? Or will I hold knowledge? I have hostage.

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:20.159
If we get up and all humility and do these things, then we can say Jesus Humble Act as recorded

00:46:20.159 --> 00:46:27.519
here in John 13 has made a lasting and indelible impression not only on Peter and John, but on me.

00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:36.000
What a powerful lesson. Humility will improve the way we carry out our

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:42.079
Theocratic assignments. It honors our fellow workers and it promotes unity.

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:52.079
Unified servants of God get things done. In Peru, local brothers worked with international servants and

00:46:52.079 --> 00:47:00.480
volunteers to complete two new assembly halls. In this report, hear what the brothers learned from

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:07.039
working together and how the new assembly halls are being used to glorify Jehovah.

00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:31.860
I suppose whatever we give to Jehovah, it's little in comparison what he gives to us.

00:47:32.659 --> 00:47:37.139
And like Malachi 310 says, you know, we just have to bring in the 10th path really is all Jehovah's

00:47:37.139 --> 00:47:44.500
asking, but he pours out of blessing. Part of those blessings from Malachi 310, I consider to be

00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:50.340
the friendships that we've gained. For me, my favorite thing is people, it's always, it's just

00:47:51.219 --> 00:47:57.619
just getting to work with your brothers every day. The personalities shine through even with language

00:47:57.619 --> 00:48:02.900
differences. You just make friends and you just get this taste of what the new new world is going to

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:08.500
be like. Side by side with our brothers and we've made parent figures and brother and sister

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:15.780
figures and everybody just becomes part of such a solid family. Working along with the local

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:22.340
brothers and sisters made it clear to me that we really are in the organization that Jehovah is

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:31.619
directing today. What I have seen is how Jehovah's spirit operates in his organization.

00:48:32.739 --> 00:48:38.820
There were many international servants here from various countries with different personalities

00:48:39.619 --> 00:48:42.739
along with our local brothers with their distinct customs.

00:48:43.699 --> 00:48:52.739
But when it was time to work, we were as one. There wasn't a big guy, a little guy, someone more

00:48:52.739 --> 00:49:00.579
intelligent or less intelligent. We all formed one united team. The language definitely was an issue

00:49:00.579 --> 00:49:06.900
for me. At first I thought, will I really be able to work with the brothers?

00:49:07.219 --> 00:49:13.059
Since I didn't understand the language, how could I explain the work that had to be done?

00:49:16.539 --> 00:49:21.500
Really, if you go in there with a good attitude that you're just having a good time working with

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:25.260
your brothers, you're not going to have too much of a problem. Smile, they cross the borders.

00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:40.590
The Chiklao dedication program was held April 9th, 2016 and it through he assembly hall was

00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:53.409
dedicated shortly thereafter on July 31st. All present marveled with appreciation at seeing the

00:49:53.409 --> 00:50:05.900
facilities. Their own new assembly hall. Before we had to work a lot, maybe up to 15 days beforehand

00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:12.699
to prepare a completely inappropriate site, not anymore, now the brothers only need to maintain it

00:50:12.699 --> 00:50:19.179
and simply arrive in order to enjoy their assembly. I'm sure that this new assembly hall

00:50:19.179 --> 00:50:26.110
will strengthen the spirituality of our dear brothers and sisters. If I could say something about

00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:34.219
the video monitors, they've revolutionized Jehovah's Method of teaching. We get so much more out of

00:50:34.219 --> 00:50:39.900
the talks now because we can see the gestures of the brothers. It really touches the heart. It's so

00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:49.300
amazing. I remember more than 25 years ago, I prayed to Jehovah and said, Jehovah, please,

00:50:50.019 --> 00:50:56.420
permit me at some point to see an assembly hall here. And now, Jehovah let me be part of the

00:50:56.420 --> 00:51:04.260
buying process, getting the documentation and to be in the construction. And I remember and I say,

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:16.690
Jehovah answered my prayer. Well, it affected me seeing the construction progress because when we

00:51:16.690 --> 00:51:22.530
first arrived in our project in Chiklao, you know, what the brothers had, what they were using as

00:51:22.530 --> 00:51:30.289
a assembly hall. And then to see the finished project that we see now, I'm so happy for the

00:51:30.289 --> 00:51:37.170
brothers and sisters. It's a beautiful, clean, neat and tidy. It's like a, in reality from where

00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:42.849
it is, it's a little jewel within that whole city to me. When I see a completed project,

00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:49.650
and I know that brothers do just love to be able to care for that place, to be able to go

00:51:49.650 --> 00:51:55.409
worship Jehovah there, be with their brothers and sisters. There's nothing that'll ever compare

00:51:55.489 --> 00:52:09.820
with this wonderful experience we've gotten to have. It's been great. We've enjoyed a wonderful

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:16.460
program. Our videos showed us so many of the ways we can present our gift to Jehovah.

00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:25.739
I agree. We saw our brothers, young and old, give their best in the ministry, in the congregation,

00:52:26.539 --> 00:52:34.699
at Bethel, and on construction projects. And we heard good counsel to be humble, morally clean,

00:52:34.699 --> 00:52:41.340
and physically clean. And to conclude our program, we have greetings from our brothers and

00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:50.460
sisters in Chad. Chad is located in North Central Africa. With this Arab desert in the North,

00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:56.460
most of Chad's more than 13 million people live in the fertile southern regions.

00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:03.659
Fewer than a thousand brothers live in preach in this vast field dotted with remote villages.

00:53:04.619 --> 00:53:11.500
The capital city is in Jameena. Five congregations are busy spraying the good news in the city

00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:18.539
and its surrounding area. One of these, just south of the capital, is the Waleer congregation.

00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:26.699
They preach regularly along the Logan River, with a often meet people traveling from far away areas.

00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:32.860
Their busy activity also helped to establish a new congregation nearby Kondul.

00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:40.539
The brothers in Kondul and Waleer send us their heartfelt Christian love and greetings.

00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:46.860
We pray for Jehovah to bless their gifts of brotherly affection and self-sacrifice.

00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:56.460
Thank you for joining us. From the World Headquarters of Jehovah's Witnesses, this is J.W. Broadcasting.
