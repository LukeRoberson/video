00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:20.820
Have you ever wanted to ask God, who are you, where are you, do you care about me?

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:33.789
You are not alone, for centuries people everywhere have felt the need to know their maker, imagine

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:42.899
a woman who has never known her father, all her life she has been told lies that her father

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:58.289
abandoned her, but deep inside she feels she knows it's not true. One day she receives

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:09.219
a letter from her father, she learns that he is alive and that unbeknown to her he had

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:16.680
been reaching out to be part of her life since the day she was born. The daughter learns

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:49.040
who her father is and eventually she finds him. They learn about one another and build

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:59.909
a strong bond until they are inseparable friends. The Bible is like a group of letters from

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:15.280
our Heavenly Father. As we read the Bible, we learn how to talk to God, how he responds

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:25.180
and the many ways he shows his tender care. The Bible can help us to do something we may

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:36.069
never have thought possible. Be God's friend. That friendship starts by learning the name

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:47.849
of your Heavenly Father and new friend and God tells us his name. You whose name is Jehovah.

00:02:47.849 --> 00:03:01.139
You alone are the most high. Jehovah guarantees that if you draw close to him, he will draw

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:11.330
close to you. Our loving Father openly extends friendship to all who search for him. Will

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:24.400
you accept his invitation to learn more about what the Bible says on this and many other topics?
