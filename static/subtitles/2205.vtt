WEBVTT

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:08.419
Previously on remember the wife of life. I'm going to realistic glasses. What? We didn't talk about this. Why?

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.539
If you made her my money out and have to go away

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:19.940
I've decided something. What is it? To start studying the Bible together. You mean you want to become a priest? Come on, Rick

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.260
It's Jehovah's Witnesses isn't it, Dad? What are you trying to say? All I see is an unhappy man

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.660
You have no idea how much pressure glory is putting on me

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.859
You're not the same person that I once knew

00:00:53.130 --> 00:01:15.040
It was time for something new actually we can make new things. We even got a new piano for it. Oh nice

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.680
Have some dessert. Thank you

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:24.680
Hey, I've been very some relatives for dinner

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.760
Yeah, so I see

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.200
Are you hungry?

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.799
Here's the oranges. Oh, thank you

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:35.599
Hey, let's go

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:41.159
Wait a minute. Hold on. Why did you arrange this without telling me? Well, surprise

00:01:41.879 --> 00:02:27.960
Why did you arrange this without telling me? I thought you'd be nice to have a family dinner

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.360
But none of them are in the truth

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:32.639
How else are you going to witness to them?

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.719
They're only here to socialize. They're not here to talk about Jehovah. Come on, Brian. They're family. Let's go and talk

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:46.750
Is your mother okay? Hey, Henry. Hey, well, I'll let you guys talk

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:54.669
Hello, Henry. How are you? Okay. What has been much of you lately? Yeah, well, we've been pretty busy busy

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:02.949
Well, I can tell you spend a lot of time with your church, but how it does we felt really left out

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:15.830
We have other relatives who are Christians. I mean, they will be spent time with us during holidays

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:18.229
Henry as I've explained before

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:26.189
When we became witnesses, they're just certain practices. We don't want to compromise on our beliefs are very important to us

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.629
Between that and work

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:32.229
We really do have busy schedules

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:40.270
Well speaking of work, I'm out of work at this moment. I'm sorry to hear that Henry. So if you hear of any job openings

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.030
I mean, I've got a lot of experience. Would you excuse us for a moment?

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:56.319
Gloria, recently you have done well. I must congratulate you on your hard work with my company. Thank you uncle

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:58.800
but

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.120
Do not forget it's not just your hard work that is giving you all this. Yes uncle

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:10.159
I understand and thank you for everything then you must not let me down

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.000
Oh, do you mean uncle? I am talking about your priorities

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.800
What about them? You must learn to keep your religion in its place

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Of course you can have your God

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.399
But it must not interfere with what's most important in your life

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.639
Your relative's and your career

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.480
Your religion gets in the way of what's expected of you

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:43.120
Well uncle, I understand how important these things are to you into all of my relatives

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.480
But as I explained to you before when I became one of Jova's witnesses

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:56.519
Spiritual things also became very important to me. Yes, and I've never agreed with your choice. Have I?

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.579
No

00:04:59.579 --> 00:05:04.220
And yet I've given you this job. I helped you get this beautiful apartment

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.060
Because the way you live

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.060
Reflects on me

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.060
You know that since your father passed away

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:18.220
I've taken the responsibility as family had towards you as well as your mother and your brother

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:23.420
Have you forgotten all I have done for you?

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:27.139
No

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:29.139
I do remember

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:33.980
Then you must serve my company and work hard for me

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.379
This is for family Gloria. This must be your priority

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.550
Must make me proud

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:50.519
Remember what I've said to you. You can lose all this very easily

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:58.300
Do you understand? Yes, I understand

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:21.579
Good

00:06:21.579 --> 00:06:22.779
Mom

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:24.779
Why are you reading a medical book?

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:26.779
I'm reading about my problem

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:28.779
Problem. What problem?

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:35.139
Pain in my back. You didn't tell me you have any pain. I called you three times, but it didn't answer

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:40.459
Mom, I didn't see any calls from you. I wouldn't need to call you if you would visit me

00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:45.939
I hardly see you anymore since you moved here. Mom, I came by only three days ago

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:54.500
One day you'll come by and find me on the floor not breathing. I want you to take me to the top

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.720
Go ahead and laugh. Are you going to follow his instructions this time?

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.399
At this rate, I may not be around to see my granddaughters get married

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:08.800
Ma'am, we're going to see Dr. Tomorrow, okay?

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.519
Gloria

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:13.519
When you are little

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:19.199
My mom used to live with us and later your father's mother, too. Remember that?

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.120
Yes

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.040
My apartment is not like this big and one

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.839
Mine is cold and drafty, you know. I think that's why I had this

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:35.639
pain

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:51.779
Mom, she wants to move you with us

00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:15.879
Brother Wim's next visit is the third week of March. It's the same week of the memorial

00:08:16.759 --> 00:08:19.720
So make sure you put that in your calendar. Okay. Oh

00:08:22.759 --> 00:08:25.000
I have a big showing on same day as memorial

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:32.600
It's the new property on glass me to handle the the day of the memorial. Yeah

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.419
But it's okay. I I can get Ma'am to cover for me once I sit up

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:42.860
Okay, you better make sure that he can handle that

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:47.289
Yeah, all right

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:55.049
Hey, what were you and uncle talking about on the balcony tonight?

00:08:56.649 --> 00:09:01.929
It's nothing. We're just talking about business. Are you sure? Because it seemed like a bother, do you?

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.320
He's putting a lot of pressure on me

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.360
It's okay. I can handle you

00:09:13.879 --> 00:09:17.399
Really? I mean, what can we?

00:09:18.919 --> 00:09:29.690
What do you mean? I'm just saying look at us actually Joe spoke with me today

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:37.210
About what? Well, he's concerned about us spiritually. He feels we've become materialistic

00:09:40.409 --> 00:09:42.409
Joe doesn't understand our background

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:47.529
And is it really wrong to try to improve our life? No, but

00:09:48.649 --> 00:09:52.570
Not if it means putting anything or any one ahead of Joe over

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:57.210
But don't you think we need to make some sacrifices if you want nice things?

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:03.210
We have made sacrifices all the wrong ones. You even had to quit pioneering

00:10:03.929 --> 00:10:05.929
We're neglecting family worship

00:10:06.889 --> 00:10:08.889
Study service

00:10:09.129 --> 00:10:11.129
We've even become too busy

00:10:11.929 --> 00:10:14.490
Or maybe too ashamed to even pray together

00:10:15.289 --> 00:10:19.879
Gloria we're drifting apart from each other

00:10:20.919 --> 00:10:27.000
But look at this place. It's so nice. I don't want to give it up

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.600
Gloria

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.840
We don't want this place

00:10:33.639 --> 00:10:36.840
If it takes us or you away from Jehovah

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:41.320
Besides we haven't been able to rent out the old place yet

00:10:42.039 --> 00:10:44.039
We have two mortgages

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.240
But more than that Gloria

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.720
Think of all we taught the girls when they were little

00:10:50.759 --> 00:10:53.399
About putting Jehovah ahead of everything else

00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:58.039
Do you remember Brother Williams talk a couple years ago about

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.919
Not being able to serve two masters

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.639
And how lots wife put her home ahead of Jehovah

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.720
Jesus told her story as a lesson for us

00:11:12.539 --> 00:11:15.019
We have to remember the wife of Lot

00:11:16.379 --> 00:11:18.700
It didn't have to end that way for her

00:11:19.899 --> 00:11:21.899
And it doesn't have to end that way for us

00:11:26.059 --> 00:11:28.299
Do you think we're that bad?

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:49.559
Come here on us to get back to where we were

00:11:50.519 --> 00:11:55.340
Spiritually I want you close to me again

00:11:56.539 --> 00:12:02.220
Remember let's say a prayer

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:22.600
Jesus name can turn this around

00:12:23.639 --> 00:12:26.870
You can do it

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:31.429
Jehovah will help us

00:12:31.429 --> 00:12:32.389
I'm proud of you

00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:37.429
And I finished cleaning up

00:12:37.429 --> 00:13:01.480
We have to remember the life of Lot

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:05.929
It didn't have to end that way for her

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:09.850
And it doesn't have to end that way for us

00:13:10.649 --> 00:13:33.669
Hey, so I was wondering

00:13:33.669 --> 00:13:35.669
Tomorrow what time do you think we'll finish?

00:13:35.669 --> 00:13:37.830
Look Anna, we're really behind schedule

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:39.909
So I need to be a team player on this

00:13:40.549 --> 00:13:43.029
Okay, whenever I not been a team player

00:13:43.029 --> 00:13:45.990
Some people on the team feel that you're getting special treatment

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:46.950
Because we're related

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:49.590
And I have to make sure that everyone gets treated equally

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:51.830
When have I ever asked for special treatment?

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:53.269
It's your church being is Anna

00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:54.549
If we're all working overtime

00:13:54.549 --> 00:13:55.590
I can't keep covering for you

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:57.350
So you can go while everyone else stays

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:00.149
But you said when I started that it wouldn't be a problem

00:14:00.149 --> 00:14:01.909
Look, I remember what I said

00:14:01.909 --> 00:14:03.830
But things change Anna

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:05.429
And if you want to be part of this team

00:14:05.429 --> 00:14:06.870
You need to do your part

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:08.149
And that's starting now

00:14:08.149 --> 00:14:10.549
Working overtime every night this week till we get caught up

00:14:10.549 --> 00:14:11.110
Every night

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:12.549
I can't do that Kevin

00:14:12.549 --> 00:14:14.230
Tomorrow is a really important meeting

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:15.350
It's the memorial

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:16.789
I told you already

00:14:16.789 --> 00:14:17.509
I remember

00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:19.509
But I can't make an exception for you

00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:20.070
But who knows?

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:21.429
Maybe if we work hard enough

00:14:21.429 --> 00:14:23.029
We'll get caught up and you can still go

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:28.500
This is close to lunch

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.100
So let's grab the rest of the team

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:30.740
And get some food

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.340
And we could talk about this later

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:32.820
Okay?

00:14:34.179 --> 00:14:34.820
Fine

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:35.940
Nice haircut by the way

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:36.740
Thanks

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:37.940
My dad doesn't like it though

00:14:38.899 --> 00:14:39.700
Of course

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:44.919
Tell us how you work yourself

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.200
Hey, look at those religious fanatics over there

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.679
I bet they get along great with your strict parents

00:14:50.679 --> 00:14:51.559
Hey, Anna

00:14:58.519 --> 00:15:00.759
These are the top headlines from BNC News

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:05.000
Death tolls continue to rise in the wake of a massive earthquake

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.840
With a magnitude of 8.1

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.850
The struck off the Tuesday

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:12.090
And was spelled as far away as Tokyo Japan

00:15:12.649 --> 00:15:16.330
The resulting tsunami has caused devastation in the entire region

00:15:17.129 --> 00:15:20.809
Meanwhile, the global financial meltdown continues to plague stocks

00:15:20.809 --> 00:15:24.330
As market prices drop drastically once again today

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.690
China's government suspended trading early in fears of a sell-off

00:15:30.409 --> 00:15:30.730
Hello

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:32.570
Gloria, hi

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:34.809
I was just catching up on where we stand

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:37.990
There's no property

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.950
It's Marty

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:41.269
Remember, the showing is on for tomorrow

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:45.110
And you can still help me out when I need to leave, right?

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:46.070
Yes, of course

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:47.029
I wouldn't miss it

00:15:47.029 --> 00:15:48.950
There's gonna be a ton of big investors there

00:15:49.429 --> 00:15:51.750
Just be sure you can be there on time

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.909
I have to leave once everything's set up

00:15:53.909 --> 00:15:56.470
And this is really important to me, Marty

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:58.389
I'm counting on you

00:15:58.389 --> 00:15:59.429
Absolutely

00:15:59.429 --> 00:16:00.470
Anything for you

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:07.100
We'll talk to you later

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.019
You made sure with Marty that he could cover

00:16:09.019 --> 00:16:10.299
Yes, he'll be there

00:16:10.299 --> 00:16:13.500
Well, once you come over, we're gonna start our memorial Bible reading

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:22.809
Okay

00:16:22.809 --> 00:16:26.490
Okay, so we're starting with Mark chapter 141

00:16:33.769 --> 00:16:34.250
Anna

00:16:35.129 --> 00:16:36.570
I thought you had a big day at work

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:38.409
I did

00:16:38.409 --> 00:16:40.809
Then where are you home so early?

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:47.850
I just

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:49.610
I'm just so ashamed of myself

00:16:52.149 --> 00:16:54.710
Just saying, honey, come over here

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:04.890
Anna

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:07.049
What are you talking about?

00:17:07.049 --> 00:17:09.960
I saw

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:11.240
Mary

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:13.000
and Ricky

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:15.480
Out in service today

00:17:19.059 --> 00:17:20.900
I couldn't even acknowledge them

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.319
Well, I don't know why I'm doing this anymore

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.759
The people I'm working with

00:17:28.759 --> 00:17:30.119
They're not who I thought they were

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:34.490
In this job, it's not making me happy

00:17:36.089 --> 00:17:38.170
And I know it's not making Jehovah happy

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:41.140
Anna

00:17:42.579 --> 00:17:44.500
You can't just quit like this

00:17:46.779 --> 00:17:48.539
I want you to have comfortable life

00:17:49.579 --> 00:17:51.500
So that you don't need to worry about money

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:53.980
You have to be successful

00:17:54.619 --> 00:17:56.619
With a secure job and it will

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.180
It will help you to pioneer

00:18:08.339 --> 00:18:09.700
I know you care about me

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:14.220
But if I keep this job

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.180
I know where you'll take me

00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:21.019
It's changed me so much already

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.900
I want to be a success

00:18:25.579 --> 00:18:27.819
But I want to be a success in Jehovah's eyes

00:18:50.309 --> 00:18:51.269
We're sure

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:53.190
That's what you want to do

00:18:55.640 --> 00:19:06.220
Yes, I am so proud of you

00:19:06.619 --> 00:19:11.589
Because you have the courage to do

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:20.539
What I should have done

00:19:20.539 --> 00:19:21.740
What are we going to do now?

00:19:22.779 --> 00:19:24.700
We need to examine our priorities

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:26.299
Together

00:19:28.779 --> 00:19:31.579
But if we make the changes that we need to

00:19:34.069 --> 00:19:36.150
We might give up this place

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:40.470
Is that all right with everyone?

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.630
Finally, I never like to space anyway

00:19:49.509 --> 00:19:51.430
Can we at least keep the new piano?

00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:54.390
Only if we do something about your hair first

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:56.549
You will

00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:57.750
Good point

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:05.660
Can I help you?

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.180
Hey good morning sir, how are you?

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:07.819
Good, thank you

00:20:07.819 --> 00:20:09.019
Good, my name is Joe

00:20:09.019 --> 00:20:12.220
And this morning we're leaving this invitation with your neighbors

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.420
This is your copy here

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:14.380
Okay, thank you

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:14.779
Okay

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:16.539
Director Williams

00:20:16.539 --> 00:20:17.819
This is a nice surprise

00:20:18.059 --> 00:20:20.299
I haven't seen you since you were overseeing our division

00:20:20.299 --> 00:20:21.339
Donald

00:20:21.339 --> 00:20:22.779
I didn't know this was your home

00:20:22.779 --> 00:20:24.539
Yeah, but I mean what brings you here?

00:20:24.539 --> 00:20:25.740
Well, I've changed careers

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:26.539
Really?

00:20:26.539 --> 00:20:27.019
Yes

00:20:27.019 --> 00:20:29.339
You must have gotten a really good offer

00:20:29.339 --> 00:20:30.299
You know, Donald

00:20:30.299 --> 00:20:32.619
I finally found a far better career

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:34.700
And something more important

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:35.099
Really?

00:20:35.099 --> 00:20:37.019
If you have a moment, I'd love to tell you about it

00:20:37.019 --> 00:20:38.779
Would you guys like to come in for some coffee?

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:39.740
Absolutely

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:40.700
Yeah, yeah, sure

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:41.180
Please come in

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:41.660
Thank you

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:50.569
Morning

00:20:50.569 --> 00:20:51.049
Hello

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:52.809
Okay, uh

00:20:53.609 --> 00:20:55.210
What are you guys going to sell me today?

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:55.930
Nothing sir

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:57.369
We have an invitation for you

00:20:57.369 --> 00:20:59.210
It's uh, to a special event tonight

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:00.410
Okay, sure, thanks uh

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:03.049
Hey, aren't you Arthur Gomez?

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:05.529
Yeah, Joe's boy

00:21:05.529 --> 00:21:07.130
And you must be his wife um

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:08.809
Mary

00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:09.609
Mary, that's right

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:12.329
I'm sorry, have we met before?

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:14.089
Oh yeah, sorry

00:21:14.089 --> 00:21:15.289
You probably wouldn't remember me

00:21:15.289 --> 00:21:16.329
But I used to work with Joe

00:21:17.049 --> 00:21:19.130
Yeah, he would always show us pictures of the boys

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:20.569
And talk about you guys all the time

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:22.809
I could tell he was really proud of his family

00:21:23.849 --> 00:21:25.130
It's really nice of you to say sir

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:27.930
Man, Joe, he changed so much

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:29.930
I remember when I first started working with him

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:31.609
He had this temper

00:21:31.609 --> 00:21:33.690
And he would just lose it over the smallest thing

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:36.329
But then he really started changing

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:39.690
I guess he said it was what he learned from the Bible

00:21:40.329 --> 00:21:42.170
Well, from you guys, right?

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:44.170
Actually, you could be surprised

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:48.170
It was Joe who first suggested that we study the Bible as a family

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:48.970
Not us

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:49.769
Really?

00:21:49.769 --> 00:21:50.410
Yeah

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:51.609
Okay, this I've got to hear

00:21:52.329 --> 00:21:55.849
Do you ever really regret this thing you made to uh,

00:21:55.849 --> 00:21:58.170
you know, leave your career and start pioneering?

00:21:58.170 --> 00:21:59.130
Absolutely not

00:21:59.769 --> 00:22:02.170
Well, regret is that I hadn't started so much

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:26.339
Sounds really nice

00:22:26.339 --> 00:22:27.140
Thanks, Anna

00:22:30.619 --> 00:22:32.140
Is there something wrong with my hair?

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:34.859
Tina helped me fix it yesterday

00:22:35.579 --> 00:22:36.460
It's fine, Anna

00:22:37.579 --> 00:22:38.460
You're beautiful

00:22:38.779 --> 00:22:39.339
You know that?

00:22:40.059 --> 00:22:42.140
Why are you getting all sentimental?

00:22:44.299 --> 00:22:47.099
Last night, when I told you I was proud of you,

00:22:47.819 --> 00:22:48.460
I meant it

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:50.539
Thank you

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.740
I should have never pushed into that internship

00:22:54.779 --> 00:22:55.900
I was pressuring you

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.619
the way my mother tried to pressure me

00:22:59.819 --> 00:23:00.619
It's okay, mom

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:03.819
I know you just want what's best for me

00:23:05.019 --> 00:23:05.500
I do

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:09.019
But I was setting a bad example for you

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:13.019
You don't need a prestigious job to pioneer

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:17.579
You just need something appropriate to help you make a living

00:23:21.269 --> 00:23:23.269
I left out the most important thing

00:23:24.549 --> 00:23:25.109
What's that?

00:23:27.779 --> 00:23:29.859
Remember to rely on Jehovah

00:23:29.859 --> 00:23:31.539
and he'll always help us

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.619
Before this job, when I was pioneering

00:23:36.259 --> 00:23:37.460
We always had enough

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:43.220
If we put Jehovah first, he will help us no matter what

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:47.460
Anna, everything comes at a cost

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:51.539
If you put your career first like I've been doing,

00:23:52.259 --> 00:23:54.099
there's very little left for Jehovah

00:23:56.019 --> 00:23:57.299
You made the right decision

00:23:58.019 --> 00:23:58.660
Thank you

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:03.769
Hey, you girls look like you're enjoying yourselves

00:24:05.289 --> 00:24:06.809
Did you pick out your office for tonight?

00:24:07.289 --> 00:24:10.730
Yep, mom, do you really have to go to that show tonight?

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:12.490
I don't want to

00:24:13.369 --> 00:24:15.769
But I gave my word to Uncle

00:24:15.769 --> 00:24:17.930
and he's expecting me to take care of it

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:20.329
I've got myself into this

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:22.809
and now I have to finish it

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:26.170
But this is the last time

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:27.769
Don't worry

00:24:27.769 --> 00:24:29.849
Okay, so you're not going to be late, right?

00:24:30.569 --> 00:24:31.289
I won't be late

00:24:32.089 --> 00:24:35.369
Marty will be there and as soon as everything is set up, I can leave

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:36.730
Nothing will happen

00:24:37.529 --> 00:24:39.369
Okay, I just want to make sure that

00:24:39.849 --> 00:24:41.049
This isn't going to be a problem

00:24:41.049 --> 00:24:41.690
It won't be

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:45.609
Mom, promise me you'll be at the memorial

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:50.440
I promise I have to leave now

00:24:50.839 --> 00:24:51.559
Or I'll be late

00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:58.150
We'll see you there

00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:59.589
Yeah, I'll see you there

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:30.900
Marty, this is Gloria

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:32.099
Where are you?

00:25:32.099 --> 00:25:33.299
I'm at the showing now

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.539
You know, I'm counting on you to be here

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.500
Just call me back right away

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:39.299
Okay?

00:25:39.299 --> 00:25:50.579
Excuse me, I need to prove on what time to set the old days

00:25:50.579 --> 00:25:52.259
I mean, as soon as guests are arriving

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:54.660
You know, check with Marty when he gets here

00:25:55.619 --> 00:25:57.220
He's supposed to be handing it all over this

00:25:58.259 --> 00:26:01.059
Oh, and to make sure wine is to open now so he can breathe, okay?

00:26:03.369 --> 00:26:06.329
When people are starting to arrive, surely you want me to say something

00:26:06.809 --> 00:26:09.130
I serve something now, then go ahead and figure something out

00:26:11.579 --> 00:26:12.299
Hello, sir

00:26:12.299 --> 00:26:14.380
Where's the list of property details?

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:15.900
Yes, I can get one for you, sir

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.140
But can I ask you who's the agent you're working with?

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:19.660
Ah, yes, I'm working with Marty

00:26:20.059 --> 00:26:20.779
Where is he?

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.660
Marty, yes, he's on his way, sir

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:25.339
He'll be here very soon

00:26:25.339 --> 00:26:27.900
In the meantime, would you like to have something to drink?

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:28.700
Sure

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:29.900
Come this way, please

00:26:33.819 --> 00:26:35.019
Girls, you look nice

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:37.019
Thanks, then

00:26:37.019 --> 00:26:38.220
Is my mom on a way to the hall?

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:39.259
You know what, let me check

00:26:39.259 --> 00:26:41.420
Um, let me send her a quick text

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:43.500
I mean, think about it

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.420
Privacy, outer living

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:46.940
Where can you get it in the city, right?

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.279
Excuse me, I have to talk to other clients as well

00:26:52.279 --> 00:26:53.480
Okay, so thank you

00:26:58.490 --> 00:26:59.930
How's it going, everyone?

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:00.890
Are you guys doing okay?

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:02.170
Yes, good

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:05.369
When is Marty going to be here?

00:27:06.009 --> 00:27:08.890
He was supposed to show me some other offerings in this building

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:11.130
Yes, Marty will be here very soon, sir

00:27:12.009 --> 00:27:13.609
Would you care for another glass of wine?

00:27:13.609 --> 00:27:14.970
My can't stay long

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:16.730
I have another important meeting tonight

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:21.430
Did she text back?

00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:24.549
No, I don't see anything yet

00:27:25.349 --> 00:27:26.789
Then why don't you just call her?

00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:28.549
She probably didn't see your text

00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:30.470
Or she could be on a way to the hall already

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:31.589
Yeah, that's a good point

00:27:31.589 --> 00:27:33.109
Let me just give her a quick call

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:42.779
The memorial's going to start in less than an hour

00:27:42.779 --> 00:27:43.819
Did you leave yet?

00:27:43.819 --> 00:27:45.180
I can't leave yet

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:45.819
What?

00:27:45.819 --> 00:27:48.140
I thought you made arrangements so that you could leave whenever you want

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:49.500
I know, I know

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:52.140
Marty said he's going to be here, but I can't reach him now

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:53.339
Glory, what are you going to do?

00:27:53.339 --> 00:27:54.940
I'll figure something out, I gotta go

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:55.180
Okay

00:27:58.150 --> 00:27:59.990
Dad, where's mom?

00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:02.150
She is coming, right?

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:03.190
She promised

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:04.549
Yeah, she said she would be there

00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:06.069
Yeah, I know girls

00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:08.230
Marty's not there yet

00:28:09.509 --> 00:28:10.710
I don't know what your mom's going to do

00:28:20.359 --> 00:28:22.359
Promise me, you'll be at the memorial

00:28:23.559 --> 00:28:24.759
I promise

00:28:24.759 --> 00:28:41.259
The wife of...

00:28:41.259 --> 00:29:01.750
Mom, are you okay?

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:03.589
Marty, finally, you're here

00:29:03.589 --> 00:29:04.470
Where were you?

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:06.230
Do you know how many times did I call you?

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:07.269
I'm so sorry, Gloria

00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:10.309
My phone died on the way over here and the traffic is just terrible

00:29:10.309 --> 00:29:12.230
Well, look, I've got everything set up

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:13.990
Make sure you take care of everybody, okay?

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:15.910
And do not forget the least details

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:19.509
And before I go, I have to introduce you to really important brokers

00:29:19.509 --> 00:29:20.869
Let's go, let's go, hurry

00:29:20.869 --> 00:29:39.160
Hurry up

00:29:40.599 --> 00:29:41.079
What's going on?

00:29:41.079 --> 00:29:42.039
Where are you going?

00:29:42.039 --> 00:29:44.440
Oh, okay, I didn't know you were coming tonight

00:29:45.079 --> 00:29:48.839
You didn't think I would give you such an important building to sell

00:29:48.839 --> 00:29:49.960
And not check in on you

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:53.880
Uncle, we have really important religious evidence tonight

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:56.759
I did everything you asked me to do for the showing

00:29:56.759 --> 00:29:58.279
But I have to leave now

00:29:58.279 --> 00:29:59.640
That's nonsense

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:02.279
You stayed right here and cared for the investors

00:30:02.279 --> 00:30:04.839
But, Uncle, I did everything for you

00:30:04.839 --> 00:30:08.680
Will you disgrace me here in front of everyone?

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.920
You have my respect, Uncle

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:11.880
But what?

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.680
There is no discussion

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.000
Remember who it is you are speaking to

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000
I have to go, Uncle

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.599
This is most important to me

00:30:21.559 --> 00:30:24.519
Jehovah is most important to me

00:30:24.519 --> 00:30:25.799
Please understand

00:30:25.799 --> 00:30:29.160
If you leave now, you will lose everything

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:39.690
We invite all to please find their seats

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:43.210
Our program will begin in just a few minutes

00:30:43.369 --> 00:31:27.420
The observance of the Morton Savior will be singing song number 147

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:29.819
Entitled a special possession

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.579
That night changed me forever

00:31:34.779 --> 00:31:38.220
I came so close to letting my relationship with Jehovah

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:39.980
Slift through my fingers

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:42.779
I almost ended up like a woman in the Bible

00:31:42.779 --> 00:31:44.700
I would never want to imitate

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:48.700
Thankfully, I was able to change in time

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:52.220
Because I remembered the wife of Lot
