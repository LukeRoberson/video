00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:11.939
My name is Davey Lose. I studied biochemistry at the University of Lurven in Belgium, and

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:17.379
after that time I did a PhD in the same area. When I was a young child I believed in the

00:00:17.379 --> 00:00:24.739
Bible, but growing up I kind of lost my interest in it. When you go to university and you study

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:30.339
life sciences or biochemistry for example, you get introduced into the idea of the origin

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:35.780
of life very quickly and also into the principle of evolution. The professors who talk these

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.380
courses, they were really scientists with long careers and they were well-established scientists

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.020
and we had a lot of respect for them so there was just no way to really question the principle

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:55.649
of evolution. In 1999 there was a war in Europe in Kosovo and I remember reading in the Bible

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.289
as a child about the future events that would take place and I started wondering whether the

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:09.569
war in Kosovo was one of those events so that led me to pick up the Bible again. At the time I felt

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:15.409
that I had to re-examine my beliefs about the origin of life and also about the principle of evolution.

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:22.930
Based on the theory of evolution we would expect to see an abundancy of transitional forms to be

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.129
present in the fossil record but when we do look at the fossil evidence we just don't see that.

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:34.530
We see that the major species come into existence at specific times and their form and structure

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.489
is still exactly the same as their form and structure today. It was actually Darwin himself who

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:47.489
wrote in his book that the biggest objection that could be brought against his theory would be

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:53.250
the fact that the fossil record does not show an abundance of transitional forms

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:59.650
and that's what really happened if you look at the set of data the fossil record seems to prove

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:07.969
the opposite of evolution. As a biochemist I had the opportunity to learn about and study many

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:15.490
different biomolecules and I observed that pretty much every biomolecule is really a complex molecule

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:22.689
we can look at them as nanoscale molecular motors or machines that are performing very complex

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:29.009
and specific tasks. For me the complexity that we see in nature and the complexity and those

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:39.009
molecules points to the fact that they're really as a creator.
