00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:08.689
My family were non-practicing Catholics, so I was never taught to believe in God.

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:17.690
I trusted my teachers more than anyone else, so I accepted and loved the theory of evolution.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:26.219
When I was 19, a childhood friend who had become one of Jehovah's Witnesses started to call on me.

00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:31.219
I liked talking to him, but when he spoke to me about God, I told him,

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:39.820
please, stop talking about God because I don't believe in him. He never gave up on me.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:47.820
He asked, why won't you, just for a moment, entertain a conversation about God?

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.820
This question made me think. I had rejected his arguments without even listening to them.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:07.730
I didn't want to give the impression of being arrogant or stubborn, so I thought, why not let him speak?

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:13.730
He used a book, Life. How did it get here by evolution or by creation?

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:22.730
It was as if a veil had been lifted from my eyes. That was the moment Jehovah introduced himself to me.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.730
Finally, I understood that my life has a purpose.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:35.730
I regret that I didn't know Jehovah for the first 20 years of my life.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.730
My relationship with Jehovah is without doubt the most precious thing I have.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:49.730
I am determined to witness about Jehovah to everyone I meet, especially to those without faith,

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.730
so that they too can appreciate the wonderful qualities of our Creator.
