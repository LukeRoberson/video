00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.980
Okay, bye kids.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:19.980
Bye dad.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:01:02.350
Have you?

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.350
Dad.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.349
Oh, hello, son.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.349
Are we still doing service tonight?

00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:08.349
Oh, um...

00:01:08.349 --> 00:01:10.349
I'm just too tired today, Teddy.

00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:11.349
Oh.

00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:13.349
I just don't have it in me.

00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:15.349
We'll do another day, okay?

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:16.349
Yeah.

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:39.980
Okay.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.980
But dad,

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.980
I thought we weren't going on the ministry.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.980
Well, I prayed for a little extra boost, Teddy.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:47.980
If you're too tired.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.980
I am tired.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:50.980
But you know what?

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.980
I'm not too tired.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.700
Let's go.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.469
Hi, Teddy.

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:27.939
Great, wasn't it?

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:40.340
Yeah.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:03:05.240
To first, John.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:12.800
So...

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.800
You know this.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.800
I get a little bit nervous, too.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.800
But if it helps, I'll do the first door.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:42.620
Let's start up with this one, then.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.620
We do, now.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.620
We're just asking our neighbors a question.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.620
No, no, no.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.620
You people and your questions.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.620
No one cares.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.620
We didn't mean to disturb you.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.620
We did.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.620
You did disturb me.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.620
So get up on property before I call the police.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.219
Those witnesses.

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:57.219
He was really angry.

00:03:57.219 --> 00:03:58.219
He was, wasn't he?

00:03:58.219 --> 00:03:59.219
Yeah.

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:02.219
Well, I always try to remember that for years,

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:04.219
I used to react exactly the same way.

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:05.219
Really?

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:06.219
Yeah.

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:09.219
As you know, I let the truth in my 20s.

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:10.219
Yeah.

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:12.219
Growing up in a violent family, it also made me violent.

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:13.219
I'm not interested.

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:15.219
Go away and don't come back!

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:18.220
Wow, so we'll change them.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.220
Well, you see, one of my good friends died.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.220
And that very same weekend,

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.220
the witnesses came round.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.220
Now, normally, I'd yell at them.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.220
But this time I listened.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.220
And that's the beauty of the truth.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.220
Anyone can change.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.220
And that is one reason why we continue preaching.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.500
So shall we continue doing this though?

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.500
Yeah.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:05:07.290
Good.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:08.290
We'd like to try some.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.290
Love too.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:10.290
Thank you.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.290
That's delicious.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.290
I've just made it.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.290
So there's specialos on the counter.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.290
Sorry, I couldn't help noticing.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.290
But your tattoo does that have a meaning?

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.290
Oh, yes.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.290
So these vines, they make a heart.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.290
It reminds me of my boyfriend.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.290
We're guessing marriage in a few months.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.290
Oh, congratulations.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.290
That's great.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.290
You know, me and my husband, we've been married for about 11 years now.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:32.290
Oh, wow.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.290
You know, I'm actually a little nervous.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.290
Nearly all my married friends are divorced now.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.290
Oh, it's completely understandable that you're nervous.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:40.290
It is a big step.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:44.290
But have you ever wondered if there's a secret to a good marriage?

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.290
No.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:48.290
But if you've got one, I'll take it.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.290
Yeah, I'd love to show you what we found helped us

00:05:50.290 --> 00:06:00.860
is a principal in the Bible.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.860
Oh, that's fantastic.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:02.860
Yeah, I just really can help myself.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.860
She's getting married in a couple of weeks.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:05.860
Yeah.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:06.860
She wasn't interested in the Bible.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.860
But I left on one of our contact cards.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:09.860
Well, you never know.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.860
She might end up on the website.
